Both places ultimately get you to the same career level, it just might take a few extra years coming from FSU to get established in your career first before going for the higher end jobs that may have been available right away from UF.\n\nI had no student debt, so my starting salary didn\u2019t matter much. I would pick FSU again, and would have been very unhappy at UF as an undergrad, the culture of the schools are very different. \n\nUF does not care about you, at all, and will leave you to fail if you don\u2019t keep up. I know a senior in finance at UF who has failed one particular class already and will be forced to switch majors and careers right before graduation if he doesn\u2019t pass this semester. UF still doesn\u2019t care and the professor isn\u2019t helping him. \n\nFSU does everything they can to help you succeed and would never allow a situation like that to happen.",

You will definitely need an MBA, MHA, or MPH masters to get into the management side however. \n\nMost of my classmates came from biology, public health, or business undergrad programs. I\u2019ve seen communications, political science, sociology etc. too though even though they\u2019re less common.\n\nI worked as a disability law paralegal for one year, then as an administrative assistant for an eye clinic for one year before being accepted to the masters. \n\nMy masters internship was in business strategy consulting for the pharmaceutical industry (most of my classmates did hospital internships, some did health insurance). Now I\u2019m an operations manager for a hospital.\n\nAnything that shows you understand what the healthcare environment is like, and that you have a passion for helping advance medical care and public health would be the perfect background. Develop hard skills like finance and data analytics if you can also, that\u2019s where most students are weakest and it\u2019ll set you up for success.",

They\u2019re only available within one year of graduating from a masters (so you\u2019re only competing with one year of people, not tons) and are a guaranteed promotional path up to director rank.\n\nThey are extremely competitive and the interviews are very intense. I applied for 23, got 8 first round, 3 second round, and 2 third round interviews. Only got one offer, which I accepted. \n\nFor the final round ones, the first place I had over 20 interviews with 6 CEO\u2019s and other high ranking people from the health system during a 3 day period including at a bar during happy hour where we were supposed to impress them in an informal environment. I mean literally standing at a bar taking shots with a CEO while debating healthcare politics and financial strategies. It was wild. \n\nThe other I walked into a board room of 16 vice presidents and they grilled me for hours over a strategic plan I developed beforehand, digging deeply into whether I could sell my idea to the board like a Vice President does to a CEO. \n\nIt\u2019s essentially a senior management training pipeline where the CEO and vice presidents personally mentor you for the first few years of your career, so they\u2019re recruiting you as a colleague not a subordinate, and have very high expectations because of it.",

While FSU doesn\u2019t have the same prestige as UF, you\u2019ll have a much better college experience at FSU and the academics are perfectly fine. If you choose FSU, make sure you research your professors before committing to a class because some of the classes can be very tough and the professors can be a little rude.

    "postText": "Hey y'all, I'm looking for a place to lease for the coming Fall and came across Vertex Apartments on Jackson Bluff. Does anybody here have any reviews about the place? There are some reviews online but I've heard that they're under new management now so I guess those would not be entirely current. I'm mainly interested in things like how responsive and professional management is, the roach and mold situation, neighborhood etc. Thanks in advance!",

We\u2019ve never had an issue with neighbors.\n\nManagement has been really nice in working with us as we have joint lease situation. Overall, my best student housing situation I\u2019ve had",

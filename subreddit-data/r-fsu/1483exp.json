I was wondering if anyone here has transferred into the Theatre BA program as a junior? \n\nI have submitted my application for Fall 2023 and keep looking at the requirements and I\u2019m getting paranoid that I\u2019m missing something. \nI have a 3.5 GPA, my AA, and it states that there is no prerequisite coursework for admittance.  \n\nany information is appreciated! :)",

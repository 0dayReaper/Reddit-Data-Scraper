    "postText": "Hello! Highly considering getting my Masters in Information Technology at FSU. I have my B.S. in Cyber Criminology. Has anyone in this sub done it and can give any input regarding the program? Professors good? Good academic resource availability? Is there a decent amount of courses available online? Would a background of the cyber criminology degree be good prep (about the same amount of CS classes as the CS minor)?",

            "comment": "You can do the MSIT entirely online.  Overall the professors are great. Like any program, you have some you\u2019d rather avoid.   4 core classes are very writing intensive but your electives that you chose help the path you are opting to go towards with the degree.  Loved the experience",

Be aware some of the classes might be a bit more library information related so you might have to teach yourself or be kind of lost. The professors so far have been good so far. They want you to succeed and will help if you need it. I am almost done with the MSI program and learned a lot. Yes all the classes are online. We normally meet up at 6PM or 8PM Eastern time on Zoom once a week.",

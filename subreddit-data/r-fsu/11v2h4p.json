    "postText": "hey guys!! i\u2019m going to be starting FSU this summer (summer b:)) and i was wondering when i should put in my request for an fsu card and pick it up. I\u2019m planning on doing the online option where you can insert your picture on your desktop (i really don\u2019t feel like taking my picture at orientation when i\u2019m all sweaty lol), but i know that they say on the website that the card is usually available for pickup after 2 days. Sooo i was wondering when you think i should put in my info to request the ID card. I live 4 hours from Tally so i can\u2019t really go pick it up from the office at any time, so orientation or the first days of summer classes seems like the best option. i\u2019m just not sure if you actually need it for orientation and/or need it before classes start in the summer. thanks guys!",

Don't wait for classes start as you will need to be able to use your FSU card to get into your residence hall building, as the building uses FSUcards as a building key.  The residence hall staff can loan you a temporary card to unlock your residence hall building doors, but it would be easier having your FSU card already at move in.  The FSU card is also useful at campus dining locations as they are cashless, though you could use credit or debit cards to pay without having an FSU card.",

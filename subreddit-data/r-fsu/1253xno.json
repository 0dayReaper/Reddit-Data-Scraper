Plenty of my quiz bowl kids have gone there but there\u2019s never really been much of a program and they didn\u2019t want to start one. Looks like there may be something now. According to NAQT\u2019s site, the person running it is a sophomore named\nRobert Szot. It doesn\u2019t have any contact info, but hopefully that at least starts you off with something.",

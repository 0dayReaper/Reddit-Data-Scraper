    "postText": "When I reserved my 5 tickets for graduation on 5/5 at 7pm, I saw the receipt had row and seat numbers assigned to the tickets. Is seating in your own place strictly enforced during ceremony? I\u2019m trying to buy 1 extra ticket for my grandma but if I buy one with a different seat number i don\u2019t want her to be split from my family.",

It isn't enforced per se, as in there won't be ushers policing where you sit, but there aren't likely to be many open seats so I wouldn't depend on being able to move. I had the same issue with my own graduation last year so wishing you the best of luck!",

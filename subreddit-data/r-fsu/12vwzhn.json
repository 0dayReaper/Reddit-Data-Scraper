There are apartments as low as $400 per month near campus if you look hard enough.\n\nThe job market however is pretty bad after graduation, since there aren\u2019t really any jobs except government, medical, legal, and retail related things in the city.",

My question is what job prospects can I expect after graduating from FSU? Is a graduate degree from FSU a very good one? Will the university help students with getting a job?",

Mechanical engineering is the lowest paying part of engineering though so it might not pay more than 60k-70k or so at first. It\u2019ll go up over time of course.",

Honestly if it is under 600 at this current time you should be cautious if it is under 500 the place is probably really bad and should be avoided at all costs. As you will get what you pay for. There are plenty of solid place in the middle to check out.",

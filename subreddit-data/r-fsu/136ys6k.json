I have a buddy who heard back in as little as 3 and I know someone who heard back after 10 weeks (but I should qualify that \u2013\u00a0they had an issue with their application that they noticed 2 weeks after submitting).",

Before the semester even started, I applied for the Spring 2023 semester and got accepted in 3 days.\n\nSo\u2026 expect 6-8 weeks for them to review your stuff. I assume they took less time with me the 2nd time because they had already reviewed me.",

After FSU accepts you, the department then has to accept you for the major you want.\n\nI'm not very familiar with the college of business nor the MIS major, but their website lists the requirements to transfer into the program:[https://business.fsu.edu/undergraduate/admission-requirements](https://business.fsu.edu/undergraduate/admission-requirements)\n\n\"Students transferring to Florida State University from any other institution are expected to have all admissions requirements completed at the time of transfer.\"",

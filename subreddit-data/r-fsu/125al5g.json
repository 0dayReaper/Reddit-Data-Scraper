    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nNearly everyone at FSU seems to be unaware that those course evaluations you fill out every semester are compiled into a database, and that database is publicly available. That information can be found [here!](https://fsu.evaluationkit.com/Report/Public)\n\nYou can see the mean, standard deviation, and distribution of each of those scores (1-5) that courses and instructors are rated on every semester. Rest assured that the data is totally anonymous and if you fill out a course eval, your name is not tied to the results in any way.\n\nYears ago, you even used to be able to read the free response comments people left! That is not the case anymore. Please spread the word about this service. Maybe people can stop asking for teacher recommendations. A man can dream \ud83d\ude01",

Yeah nothing is going to \"happen\" if they have a low response rate, but believe it or not most instructors actually value feedback in order to improve their course. Also, as noted in this thread, exceptional responses can lead to awards and are cumulatively used for the tenure process or applying for teaching jobs elsewhere.\n\nI used to work in the office that administered and compiled these evals. There's only 3 people for the entire university lol",

But if our eval outcomes are positive enough (something like &gt;90% excellent) we can get automatically nominated for a teaching award. Then after submitting an application package and a highly competitive decisions process, the award comes with something like a $1000 bonus. \n\nOn the other hand, if the return rate is too low it gets red flagged for further investigation.",

The FSU evals aren't perfect (no school's are) but the simple fact that every student in the class is at least _asked_ to fill them out solves for a lot of the bias (but not all since some students just leave them blank or Christmas tree them).",

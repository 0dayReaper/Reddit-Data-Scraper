    "postText": "Hello!! As someone interested in majoring in STEM (either engineering, computer science, or data science), I wanted to know how the programs are at FSU. I know engineering and computer/data science are in different schools, but can anyone speak on their experience with the program, facilities, staff, and overall experience. I got into UF as well, which I know is better for STEM, but I fell in love with FSU when I visited and also got into the honors program. Thanks for the help!!",

            "comment": "UF is better ranked but FSU is also ranked decently. The Engineering department is small which is great as it allows students to easily (super easily) find research opportunities and get to know professors. Most professors you will know on a first name basis if you have a good relationship with them.",

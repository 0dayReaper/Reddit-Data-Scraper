Is there anyone on campus that I can contact who would be able to make sure that the poor thing isn\u2019t just left sitting in there or will it likely be taken care of?",

I know that there are a few cat families living around campus so maybe those kittens were just lounging in the wrong place but I think it\u2019s more of a testament to just how unaware drivers here can be more than a study on the cats being dumb.",

So unless you\u2019re doing a full 360 degree inspection of your vehicle before you enter, to include your engine bay, wheel wells, and under the chassis (you\u2019re not), you\u2019re just as \u201cnegligent\u201d as who you\u2019re describing. \n\nAs for who to call, you\u2019re an adult. Google \u201cFSU police non emergency line\u201d and tell them what you typed on Reddit.",

                    "comment": "That\u2019s a pretty weird hill to die on, but I\u2019ll bite.\n\nWhen I got there the cat was in a parking space, lying along the clear white partition that you should be paying attention to when you\u2019re pulling in/out. This means that the person responsible would have either been pulling in or out (more likely out) and would have been looking at their sides at the very least. Furthermore, it was one the spaces right next to a stairwell, specifically the front-most lefthand corner next to the entrance of the garage (to the right if you\u2019re entering the garage, to the left if you\u2019re exiting the garage). This means that if you were to pull out over the right line and to the side where the kitten was found, thus obscuring the ability to see the right partition bordering the vehicle, you would scrape your car against the wall and other cars. As such, the culprit would have needed to back straight out to avoid the wall and other cars. You\u2019re not supposed to back into spaces and most people don\u2019t in that parking garage, so I\u2019m also going to say that the responsible individual backed out from the space enough to comfortably swing a left-hand turn to circle back around to the entrance. It\u2019s also incredibly easy to pull straight into that space right from the garages entrance, I have parked there myself. This means there\u2019s a good chance, not a guarantee obviously, that whoever ran that kitten over would have had a decent enough view to see what was/wasn\u2019t left in the parking space if they were looking through their windshield while shifting from reverse into drive. At the very least, the culprit likely would not have had to rely just on rear view mirrors or reverse cameras or even checking around their own car in order to see what they had done.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting this was an attack on kittens or something, nor am I saying that you\u2019re obligated to be on kitten watch while racing all around the garage. What I am saying is that you should be extra mindful of your surroundings when pulling in/out of your space and getting into/leaving your car. I personally do move around my truck and give it a look-over before I enter. I am aware that not all people do that but I think that it is a good habit to have. I know that I have low peripheral visibility in my vehicle and I would hate for that to result in something/someone getting hurt, or for my truck to be damaged somehow by something that I chose to ignore.\n\nI got a few very helpful responses about what to do by posting about the incident here, advice that I am very thankful for by the way. Other people who are on this sub can use the information I gained if they find themselves in a similar situation. Thanks to the people who responded in good faith, I was able to contact the relevant faculty/ parties and make them aware of the issue (hint: it wasn\u2019t FSU PD or any of their non-emergency lines like you suggested). You coming here a day after I posted just to focus on the single response that I made to a person who wasn\u2019t offering advice, but who was sharing a similar experience that they had on campus, shows that you aren\u2019t here in good faith. Your response doesn\u2019t actually do anything for me even if you threw it in here yesterday and not at almost 12:00/1:00 in the morning EST, many hours after it had been handled. If you wanted to respond in good faith then you would have responded to the question I was seeking an answer to in my original post while omitting anything that wasn\u2019t your latter paragraph, or to one of the other people that pointed me to an actual source instead of seeking to make my concerns about unaware drivers look unreasonable. In fact, this is how your response reads to me:\n\n\u201cWell based on what little context I can derive from the content of the original post, you\u2019re really no better than the person who killed this cat because I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re not more thorough than what I perceive as the average person in your investigation of your cars surroundings. You would have killed that cat too. Also grow up and call the police, tell them what you posted on Reddit!\u201d\n\nTL;DR: Thanks for your sage advice, I\u2019ll take it into consideration.\n\nEdit: While it\u2019s possible to avoid scraping your car against the stairwell/dividing wall to back out of that space, it is significantly more inconvenient to do so compared to backing out and going left. Even if you backed out and went right, the dead kitten would arguably be more visible because the space the driver had been occupying prior to backing out would be in their immediate field of vision. A nearby animal lying in a pool of its own blood is incredibly difficult for an attentive driver to miss, especially with little to no movement speed.",

I met with an advisor today and I need 7 classes left, 3 in summer 4 in fall or vice versa, but I\u2019m honestly so burnt out the thought of it stresses me out. I know I\u2019m close to the finish line, but I have no motivation to study, go out, work, or do anything anymore \n:(  and I really just want to graduate. I feel like I can\u2019t do it",

You are INVESTING in yourself. The dividends are going to pay off. Really. And if you give up you'll have regrets for the rest of your life.\n\nYou can do this.\n\nEveryone must choose one of two pains: the pain of discipline, or the pain of regret. -- Jim Rohn\n\nInvest in yourself.

The fact that you haven't already given up entirely and quit school says you still got more in the tank.  \ud83d\ude42\n\nPlease prioritize your mental health - it's the foundation that supports your degree efforts. Seek out the counseling and psychiatric services FSU has to offer, **especially** if you're on the university health insurance. It'll cost you $0, or near-zero dollars without university health insurance.\n\nDon't allow yourself to feel bad about struggling or asking for help. \n\nDon't 'find time' - **make time** to decompress **daily**. Choose one or two activities each day - meditate, exercise, nap, or play games - whatever absolutely takes your mind off your stresses and provides you clarity. Limit it to an hour or a couple half hour sessions; don't over-indulge. \n\nThe goal of the activities (above) is to de-stress and improve motivation. 'Change it up' if the usual activities don't cut it anymore.\n\nLastly and also importantly, how are your sleep and diet looking? Quality, quantity, consistency?",

You can see the light at the end of the tunnel! Don\u2019t give up now! Maybe consider seeing a campus counselor? It could also be a depression issue if you have no motivation for anything at all. I used them and the health center psychiatry to get me through (otherwise i would have left before sophomore year). Pretty soon it will feel like a distant memory and you\u2019ll be so proud of yourself for pushing on and making it through. Take advantage of the resources you have available and remember that it\u2019s not a race.",

I also would look into a psychologist so you can learn some coping skills and caring for your overall mental health. \n\nI pushed through burnout and felt so much pressure to have my life figured out when I graduated that I became physically sick from stress. Ended up going to grad school, not at fsu, and it just got worse. Stress and pressing through burnout and not taking time to recharge led to a major eating disorder that I never saw coming and my hair started to fall out uncontrollably. There is a lot of pressure on people about to graduate and from someone who went through immense pressure and ignored it, take time for yourself and health.",

If you have 7 left and don't want to be daunted by going from nothing in your schedule to jumping right back in, you can take 1 in the summer, 3 in the fall, and 3 in the spring. You'll still finish in the spring but you can give yourself a bit of a break during the semesters. You could even break it up a little smaller and finish in summer 2024.",

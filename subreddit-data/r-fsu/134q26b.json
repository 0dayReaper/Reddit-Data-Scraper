    "postText": "I am a sophomore about to be a junior in the fall. About to take the final in less than an hour and need an 85% on it to pass the class (yeah right). So I'm accepting defeat :/ but I have never failed a class before and am not sure what the next steps are for me. Does anyone have experience with this that can let me know what I should do so I can stay on track with my business major?  I already selected FIN3403 for the fall should I try to double up and take ACG2071 also?",

            "comment": "Few points.\n\nFirst, perfects are obviously the \"ideal\" scenario, but failing a class is not out of the ordinary. It's almost a right of passage IMO; It teaches you that it's okay to fail, and how to go about resolving the situation. By posting on here seeking advice, you're already on the right path. For perspective, I failed a particularly hard senior-level class in my STEM UG major. Twice. I finally got it on my third try and I'm in a very successful career now.\n\nUltimately, unless you're trying to get into a top-tier graduate program, companies don't care about individual grades.\n\nThat said, these would be my recommended steps:\n\n* Email your professor directly. State that you did not perform to the level this semester that you expected. Indicate that, unless you get a big surprise with your final exam grade, you don't expect to receive a passing grade for the class. Ask if it's possible for you to receive an \"I\" for the class, and attempt to improve upon your grade by making up some work over the summer (maybe you missed some homework assignments/projects, or performed very poorly on something in particular).\n* Check out course offerings for summer/fall. Is taking ACG2071 an option for you over the summer if it's offered? Is it offered during the fall and at a time which does not conflict with FIN3403? Is ACG2071 a pre-req for FIN3403?\n* If getting an \"I\" and fixing your grade is not an option, and ACG2071 is a pre-req, then email then talk to your advisor. Ask if you can double up and take both. After checking the course name, and an online syllabus for 3403, it looks like that's the UG version of a class I took in my MBA and it's more of a theoretical class rather than doing actual accounting (minus maybe some depreciation calculations). Because of this, my experience and impression is that it will be relatively easy as long as you read the material and study. Since you've already sat through ACG2071, you'll be ahead of the curve during a re-take. You know what to expect, so just study a bit more and you'll be fine. Just be very careful about re-using previous assignments the second go-around because, yes, it is possible plagiarize yourself.\n\nLastly, being off-track isn't that big of a deal. It's when a 4-year degree becomes a 5 or a 6 that the university starts to care. It's more of an issue for grants/stipends/scholarships, and one class isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme as long as it's not very early in your UG career (an F or D has a bigger impact when you've only taken 12 credit hours, versus 60). Just make sure to stay above full-time for the year.",

            "comment": "I can't say for anything specific to the business track, but overall things to consider:\n\nIf you've enrolled in any courses that require ACG2071 as a prereq, you'll have to remove those courses until you pass ACG2071.\n\nIf you're on any grants or scholarships that require a minimum number of credits or minimum gpa, you should check to make sure you won't be dipping below those requirements or if there's any clause about paying them back for failed courses.\n\nI would recommend trying to retake the class this summer if possible both to minimize impact on your time here but also because it will essentially be a review if you make it up sooner rather than later.\n\nDespite what I've just said, though, being \"off track\" really isn't that big of a deal. I'm in my final semester after five years here. I know others in similar situations and some that are taking longer. The \"four year program\" is massively overplayed and nothing to worry about.",

If you end up having to retake it, I can definitely help you with some tutoring!!\n\nMeet with an advisor so that they can let you know if you will be marked as \u201cOff Track\u201d in terms of your major. When I failed a class, I had like a semester or two to get back on track and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. After grades post, you can go to myFSU to check your major status as well.\n\nI\u2019m in FIN 3403 right now and it is definitely a challenging class. If you do both of these in the fall, just don\u2019t do more than 5 classes. Maybe add some of the easier business classes or an outstanding gen ed to balance everything out. Like everyone else said, try to retake it in the fall if possible.",

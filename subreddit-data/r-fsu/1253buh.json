The only thing on the portal about it is the ability to update housing preferences, at which point it brings me to an empty form. If anybody knows if there\u2019s a way to view the already submitted form or if I should have gotten an email/confirmation then please let me know.",

I was paranoid that it didn\u2019t submit so I entered my preferences again. Now every time I check the form it is never blank and has my preferences saved. \n\nYou should enter your preferences again just in case.",

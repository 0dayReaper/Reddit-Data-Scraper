Additionally, do we register for parking now? I thought I read somehwere that we shouldn\u2019t until after orientation but I\u2019m unsure. Thank you.",

When it becomes available it should be through a sign-up genius, where you pick a date and time slot (usually about an hour). If you are coming for the fall, parking permits open on August 15th. They're free through the FSU transportation website and you can add multiple vehicles to it if you'll be moving in with more than one car.",

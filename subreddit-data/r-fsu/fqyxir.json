I may be able to aquire a code for sharing when the Able Sisters' shop opens tomorrow, but until then, [here's](https://i.imgur.com/5aKzIYu.jpg) a raw picture of the design. Use the ball cap pro design with piece 1 as shown. All the other pieces are just garnet.\n\nI'll update tomorrow as to whether or not I have a code. If not I'll just post pictures of the garnet/gold palette I used and call it a day.\n\nEdit 2: see [this](https://i.imgur.com/v8aE8ol.jpg) for code you can use in the Able Sisters shop.",

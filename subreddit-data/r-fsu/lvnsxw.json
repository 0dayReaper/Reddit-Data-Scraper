People do not realize how Covid can literally harm you for weeks on end after. It has been three weeks for me and I still get out of breath when walking like ten feet and still have severe brain fog and cannot properly complete my assignments in classes. \n\nThey do not realize that if they get covid they may be fine, but they may give it to a peer with underlying health conditions who may be sick for long after they are back in the clubs.",

You are worth more than just your grades, and while it can be disappointing, discouraging, and depressing to not do as well as you hoped, there\u2019s always options. Failing a class or delaying graduation are normal obstacles that countless students have faced. You have already made it into a competitive college- you\u2019ve proven your abilities already and you don\u2019t need to be so harsh on yourself. \n\nDrink water, take study breaks, get some rest, and prioritize your health and wellness. You got this! \n\nIf you are facing a crisis, you can call (850) 644-8255 to speak with a counselor 24/7. If you are in crisis and need to speak with someone in person, please go to the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital Behavioral Health Access Center at 1616 Physicians Drive, Tallahassee, FL. 32308 (the entrance is at the back of the building and has a green awning and their phone number is (850) 431-5100.",

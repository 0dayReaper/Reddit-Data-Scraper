Even if u go to grad or phd program as long as u pass u will be a okay.\n\nGo to all your classess if u are concerned and office hours. If u truly feel like u will fail while doing that, a withdrawal is better than an F.\n\nRemember, you'll figure it out. Enjoy school and hope u learn about yourself as much as I did.",

I know it doesn\u2019t help that much, but just look at it like you\u2019ve done everything you can to study for the exam. If you pas you pass, if you fail you fail. I find when you just accept it for what it is you stop giving a shit haha",

Even cost accounting hardly builds off managerial accounting which in itself, is a form of cost accounting. So just relax and focus on finishing that class lol",

I just want to tell you that you got this, you just have to put maximum effort and you will see how that will pay off. I recommend you to study for the exam by doing practice questions until you know exactly what they are looking for. We are halfway done through the semester, you still have a chance to do a comeback and get the A you deserve.",

I\u2019m taking it online and she j doesn\u2019t teach nearly as well online compared to in-person (almost all in-person kids got A-C+ last test, online kids C- - F) so I\u2019m stressing out. I had to buy skoolers (this was after I finished financial accounting with a 95%+ in the class, so it\u2019s def not a lack of effort on my part), and skoolers has helped but it\u2019s still all a bit confusing to me.",

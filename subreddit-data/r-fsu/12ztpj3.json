    "postText": "I'm planning on applying to FSU's chemical engineering program with a 1400 SAT and a 3.2 GPA. I'm prepared for a waitlist or rejection, but I had concerns about the TCC2FSU track.\n\nBy the time I apply, I'll already have my AA degree due to accumulating enough dual enrollment credits in high school. To my knowledge, TCC2FSU let's you get an AA and then transfer to FSU for further education.\n\nHow would this process work if I already have an AA? The admissions officer I consulted, while I didn't ask this question, did say that I'd still apply as a first-year student instead of a transfer.",

            "comment": "You will first apply as a First Time in College, the normal high school application to be a freshman.  One of two things will happen, you will be admitted as a freshman or rejected.\n\nIf rejected, because you have you AA you can immediately apply as a transfer student and so long as you college GPA is above a 3.0 and you have take Calculus 1, you will 95% be admitted to FSU pre engineering as a transfer student.\n\nThe only reason to go to TCC would be to acquire the engineering pre requisites.  Calc 1,2,3; General Physics1 &amp;2, Differential Equations and Linear Algebra and maybe discrete math.  There are advantages to this.... At FSU Calcs are large classes and access to professors is limited, at TCC classes will be smaller and you will have an easier time talking to professors,  finding tutors etc.  You don't need TCC you could do this at any Florida college including the one granting you AA.  You woul in any of these cases probably be classified as some Chemical engineering AS degree seeking student (this degree has the needed classes) so that you would be elligible for financial aide even though everyone knows you are just meeting the pre requisites for a transfer to FSU engineering.  \n\nJust so you know, you are allowed to fail any one of the pre requisites and subsequently retake and pass and still gt into the engineering program.  It happens all the time so if it happens to you don;t feel like a failure.  only 50% of the admitted freshman who start off as engineering students actually make it to engineering school.  Calc and physics are rough weed out courses.",

Frankly I wouldn't apply to TCC at all, since you have already taken all the classes for an AA and will just be duplicating coursework.~~ See the reply to my comment for more relevant info for your situation",

                    "comment": "This is not correct - students must apply as first year students even if they have their AA, as long as the AA was earned during high school. You are not considered a transfer student for application purposes until you have earned 12 credit hours after high school graduation.\n\nI know this year, they did give freshmen applicants with their AA the option for additional consideration still as a first year, but against transfer criteria. So in OP's case if it came to that, you'd need to have all pre-engineering coursework done through your AA to be competitive.",

    "postText": "I know a lot of new people are on this subreddit and posting their acceptance or deferral letter. To those who were accepted, congratulations! There are a lot of things FSU has that will benefit your college career and future career as well. \n\nTo those who were deferred, I understand if you're disappointed. Do NOT give up! Lots of people this year applied and tough decisions were made by the college. Don't let that one deferred letter stop you from doing great things. I was deferred back in high school and went to a college closer to home. At that college, I achieved a 3.6 GPA with over 45 credit hours. I did not get my A.A, but I reapplied to FSU as a transfer student as a sophomore and was accepted. Now I am working for my degree that my previous university did not have. If you still want to go to FSU later on, the absolute best way to get into FSU as a transfer is doing the TCC2FSU program. You will be in Tallahassee but at Tallahassee Community College doing mostly your Gen Ed courses, but on track to achieve an Associates Degree that will lead you to coming to Florida State. You can even do that at another college, local, or away from home.\n\nTCC2FSU [https://admissions.fsu.edu/tcc2fsu/](https://admissions.fsu.edu/tcc2fsu/)\n\nYou should be proud of where you stand today. No, I'm not with admissions. (pls don't ask me why you got denied)",

I know it doesn\u2019t feel good right now but trust in your abilities and turn every no and doubt thrown at you into fuel for your success. You got this. Stubbornly, unyieldingly, and uncompromisingly chase your dreams. And if you go the CC route, remember it\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish. You got this. Just keep swimming. \n\nAlso not admissions. \ud83d\ude09",

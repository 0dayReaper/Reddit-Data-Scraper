Most of these programs admit students during the sophomore year to begin the major the following fall. Music, Motion Picture Arts, and the BFA programs in Theatre and Dance admit students as freshmen. Limited access programs at FSU include Athletic Training, Business, Communication, Communication Disorders, Computer Science, Dance, Dietetics, Economics, Education, Interior Design, Motion Picture Arts, Music, Nursing, Psychology, Social Work, Studio Art, and Theatre. You may wish to visit the department homepages or the Academic Program Guide at http://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/ for information about admission into these programs. More information can also be found at http://undergrad.fsu.edu/programs/limited-access-programs.\n\nHope this helps :)",

I monitored it through the last freshman admission cycle but I left Admissions last June and it looks like there are only a few comments since then.\n\nWith that said - the estimate for transfer app review is 4-6 weeks once the application has been completed and all required materials have been received. Sometimes a little quicker, sometimes a little longer, but that's a good mid-range average. When I was doing transfer review, we usually saw business school decisions come back a little quicker than that, but this is also the busiest time of the year for transfer applications.",

Then i decided to enlist in the army. I applied as a transfer for Fall 2023 with the 2.3 GPA and my 30 some credits from my army training. I will be graduating with my AA in 3 weeks with 6 As at my CC. So i will definitely be appealing. Oh and my major is History. Best of luck to you!",

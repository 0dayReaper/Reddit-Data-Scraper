    "postText": "I applied to FSU a couple months ago as a Junior transfer. I got my AA degree from a florida community college and the major I decided to pursue was International Affairs. It isn\u2019t limited access, and it supposedly doesn\u2019t have much in the way of prerequisites other than an AA degree and from what I can tell a decent GPA. I\u2019ve maintained at least a 3.5+ GPA. I guess for some reason I\u2019ve been nervous as to whether or not I\u2019ll be accepted for some reason when I don\u2019t think I have anything to worry about. I\u2019ve been waiting on a decision since October and it\u2019s just nerve wracking. It\u2019s been referred to college of social sciences but that\u2019s the only update yet. Has anyone been in a similar boat and know what they\u2019re looking for?",

You\u2019ll get in guaranteed.",

I applied for international affairs as well, I have a 3.2 from a community college in florida I am pretty sure anything 3.0 plus with a AA is almost a guaranteed admittance. I understand your worry though, I\u2019ve been trying to keep myself occupied to keep my mind off it. Best of luck!",

Sometimes programs need to see the AA posted on your transcript before they're able to move forward. When in doubt though, reach out to the college and they should be able to at least give some general information. Look for whatever admissions or mapping coordinator email is on their website.",

Thankfully I was able to talk to the mapping coordinator \u2014 I was told by the department that it was taking forever because they were working on spring applicants first and they\u2019ll start on ours as soon as possible. I sent in my final transcripts along with my AA. Thank you for the response!",

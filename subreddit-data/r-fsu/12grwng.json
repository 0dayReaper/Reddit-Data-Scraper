    "postText": "I got rejected from FSU but they recommended Aspire. I've been looking into it and evaluating all my options, but what most concerns me is if I'll even be accepted as a transfer to FSU from TCC. In my rejection letter they suggested doing Aspire and said after completing my AA I \"would be eligible to apply as a transfer student to FSU.\" I'm just wondering if it's a guaranteed admissions sort of deal or if I should have a good backup plan. I'll be graduating in May with 42 college credit hours, so I know I can definitely complete my AA in a year or less. I'm just curious as to how competitive the transfer process is from FSU if it's not a guaranteed acceptance. \n\nAnyone have any experience with this? Thanks!",

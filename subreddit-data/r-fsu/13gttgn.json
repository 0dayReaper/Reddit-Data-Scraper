            "comment": "Volker Crede was interesting. His lectures are good and his accent is nice to listen to. He wanted the class to involve no calculations. His exams, when he made them, were multiple choice conceptual questions and a handful of questions where you had to write out the formula you would use and do the manipulations without plugging the numbers in. The problem was that the class was shared with two other professors who did not agree with his teaching style, so the exam formats did not match each other and people did significantly worse on one exam versus the others for that reason. In lecture, he uses iclicker as a form of attendance. Homework was useless and did not reflect what was taught in class. Skoolers is worth it. I never got Skoolers until physics.",

Get a baseball bat or something. \n\nMy 1st floor apartment at NXNW got robbed by a crazy dude from section 8 Housing called Griffin Heights which is 30 feet away at 3 am while I was home alone because the retaining wall between the properties broke after a tree fell on it and he simply walked in. \n\nHe smashed out my living room\nwindow with a crowbar and tried dragging the TV out the window while kicking in my roommates door (he failed, the doors are solid and TV bolted to table).\n\nThe police took 25 minutes to arrive and I literally thought I might get shot as I held my bedroom door closed. That event is the reason I own a gun now.\n\nNot trying to scare you, but this actually happened to me at NXNW and you should be prepared.",

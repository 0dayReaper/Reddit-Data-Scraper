    "postText": "On a throwaway. **For anyone considering Legacy Student Living, don't. Live somewhere else.**\n\nI lived in a 1x1 this past academic year. I initially did not have any complaints outside of the usual Legacy complaints (roaches, elevators that smell like urine, old and a little run down, etc). However, after that hurricane in November, a wet spot appeared in my apartment ceiling and I reported issues with with I thought to be a little dust inside the air conditioner. I reported the dust issue 2x to maintenance (November and December) and the wet spot to maintenance (November). They did nothing to fix it and said the wet spot was \"not a big deal\" and not stemming from a leak, so there was no need to fix it. I do not think they even visited to look at my air conditioner, but I assumed it was fixed since they marked both maintenance requests as complete.\n\nFast forward to post-winter break. The second I get back, I immediately start getting sick. I went from distance running to being unable to walk to my car without having asthma attacks in 6 weeks. During this time period I had 3 specialist appointments and was not responding to ANY treatment. Now, I am at 8 specialist appointments and I do not think I will return to normal any time soon. I can no longer walk a mile without wheezing.\n\nAt this point in time, I had no idea what was making me sick. I thought it was allergies, pneumonia, flu, my asthma getting worse, etc. I had a friend visit and the SECOND I turned on my AC, she began coughing and felt her throat tighten. At this point, I definitively knew that the air conditioner was the culprit.\n\nThe next day, I went to visit the apartment management because clearly there was a safety issue with my air conditioner. It took 3 visits to the office for them to even speak with me. When they did, they took the conversation outside in the main area of the lobby, which was highly unprofessional. The maintenance supervisor began arguing and told me that there was nothing wrong with the air conditioner and denied any mold despite not once visiting the apartment. They told me it was my fault for not keeping the apartment clean.\n\nSomeone eventually came to clean the air conditioner. The photos are from February 2023 and show the interior of the AC as well as what I could see from the outside. It was absolutely disgusting and filthy.\n\nEven after they cleaned the air conditioner, I ended up in the emergency room. At this point, I returned home for the remainder of the semester and as mentioned above, have been dealing with health issues for 6+ months with no sign of them improving in the future.\n\nHad the wet spot and AC dust (and I believe mold but Legacy denies any mold and refuses to test for it) been addressed in November and December, I do not think I would be in this situation.\n\n**STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM LEGACY STUDENT LIVING.**",

I'm sorry this happened to you, we deserve better landlords, we don't have time for this crap.",

I moved in and signed the \u201cearly sign special\u201d shortly after because it\u2019s not too bad at first, but I had to deal with a whole lot of BS over the next two years. I tried getting out of the lease, but the only option you have to is to relet. I\u2019ve graduated now and finally found some poor souls to relet to, but know they\u2019re charging my almost a full months rent just to transfer the lease. You can\u2019t sublease either or they\u2019ll have a fit. Stay away for sure.",

These are all private apartment companies which prey on the fact that there are an abundance of vulnerable students each year. This constant stream of demand as new students enter the market allows for apartment complexes to charge outrageous rates for subpar living. Case in point? Despite everything OP went through, Legacy is still widely considered one of the better student apartments, because the bar is on the floor for these companies.",

Surprisingly the inside was way better than the exterior but it reeked of weed constantly.\n\nThere was a point where ladybugs were just randomly spawning in my bathroom which was fine but I never did figure out what was causing that. Sorry about the health issues though, that really sucks.",

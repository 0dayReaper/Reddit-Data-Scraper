    "postText": "I graduated (or so I thought I did) this spring. I made sure countless times with my advisor that my classes were correct and I was all set, yet somehow FSU emailed me saying that I was missing one class that I need for my diploma. The issue is, this class is only offered in person and since I thought I graduated, I have left FSU and have a full time job now. I\u2019m meeting with an advisor tomorrow, but don\u2019t know what the best course of action to take is. I could file a medical accommodation because I do have an autoimmune disorder but I\u2019m not sure if that will automatically allow me to take this course online. There is only also one instructor for this course this summer too. Help!",

They can technically be outside of your department, but your department won't like that bc they most likely want the money.\n\n(Qualified meaning they can normally teach a course in that field).\n\nAlso, an interesting tidbit (unless the rules have changed)....you can register for a DIS at any time during the semester.  Even on the last day of classes!  You will be charged a late registration fee if outside of your registration period.",

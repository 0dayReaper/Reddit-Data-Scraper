On campus just your extras and possibly food if not on a meal plan.  My son gets about $2200 per semester back (lives on campus, full meal plan, and doesn\u2019t have Florida pre paid.  If he were paying real bills out of it I would recommend that he set up an online savings account and then \u201cpay\u201c himself twice a month through automatic transfers.   a big chunk close to when rent is due and a smaller chunk halfway through the month later.",

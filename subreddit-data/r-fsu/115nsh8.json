Your chances are just as good as someone else's with your score and background. Take the time to reflect on what you might do if you don't get in. There is community college, other universities, the military and college afterwards. I did military, retired, went to community college, got in with my AA because they had to accept me into the program by state law as long as I met the minimum without competition. Degree still says FSU, on both BS and MS. Don't stress yourself out over will I won't I get in. Have a plan, B, C and D in the works. Be patient like the other 70,000 people who applied.",

If you get seminole pathways, you can study abroad regardless. to my knowledge, if you\u2019re accepted to FSU it\u2019s still really easy to be accepted to the abroad program. They like when students do this especially their not so high grade earners in high school because it places you in a setting where there are small class sizes, better relationships with professors, and you learn/grow a lot living in a new country by yourself. I studied abroad in Valencia and i wouldn\u2019t have traded my experiences for the world. I think if you have the opportunity to do it, go for it. It is one of the most valuable experiences.",

I think first semester abroad is different.  One of the kids he was with did FSA and because grades were great first semester was able to convert to FYA to take advantage of the OOS tuition waiver.",

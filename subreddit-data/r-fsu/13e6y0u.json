            "comment": "So, it's been about 7-ish years since I took COP4531. It's a pretty challenging class.\n\nThe coding projects are intensive and require far more time than 4530. While there maybe some simple solutions for some projects, you'll also be asked to find the solution within a certain time complexity. Which gets tricky. \n\nYou also have the discrete homework assignments. Which required knowledge from discrete math II. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe learning material honestly was not the best years ago, hopefully they've improved it. Either way, just be prepared to spend a decent amount of time on the assignments for this class.",

Dropping it as a requirement for the BS was not a good move by the department. \n\nMy advise is take it. Know that it will be painful but worth it. Buy the book. It's a reference you'll use over and over. There are also youtube videos of the authors of the book teaching their own material in case something your instructor teaches in class doesn't make sense.",

            "comment": "hey if you have Dr. Wong I think we are in the same class. I am an urban planning masters students but message me if you would like more information\n\nEdit: Really Urban planning is highly interdisciplinary and Geography is much more focused. I have real estate development, economic, statistics, law and demographic classes. It is much more of a generalist masters then doing geography, as the final career most likely lands in planning. That being said, almost all people who are in planning use GIS at some point and many people are hired just based on their proficiency. The issue I have with the geography department is they do not seem as well funded and staffed as the Urban Planning department. For example Urban planning is hiring professors while geography is not, and their is not much for support staff with geography.\n\nThe Urban Planning program is not without its issues, they are in a sort of rebuilding phase with many professors retiring but that is natural, whereas Geography seems more like its been hollowed out or neglected.",

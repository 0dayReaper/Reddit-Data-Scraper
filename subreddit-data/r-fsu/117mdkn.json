I never even wanted to apply to unf my parents made me for the scholarship and guess what, they gave me an amazing scholarship so now i can\u2019t decide. Im going into finance but have always wanted to go pre-med until recently so I may change back after starting school. I don\u2019t know what to do though UNF is 100x more affordable but all year i wanted to go to fsu. How do i decide is the money worth loosing the fsu real college experience?",

Debt should be avoided like the plague, but experiences are worth more than money long-term for most people.\n\nI would pick FSU personally. 18k while substantial is a low enough amount that you could make it all back just by having a part-time job throughout college if you want to. It\u2019s not hard at all to make 5k per year, even donating plasma pays that much. The college experience however is irreplaceable and the FSU brand name, connections etc. will quite likely get you at least a 10k higher salary in finance after graduation anyway.",

It\u2019s not because UNF is necessarily a \u201cbad\u201d school\u2026but it\u2019s kinda close, and certainly no shame to anyone that went there but if a \u201ccollege\u201d atmosphere and experience is what you want UNF is NOT that place. It feels like a very large community college zoned in a former industrial plant. In terms of degree value too; out of Florida schools FSU is consistently second only to UF (in certain categories we beat them and the gap closes more every year) whereas UNF often ranks around 12, underneath places like FAU and Keiser. A lot of places wouldn\u2019t take a UNF degree very seriously. So while I can\u2019t make the financial call for you; FSU is a much more valuable degree, better facilities, better staff, better campus, opportunity being close to the Capitol, better student life, college experience, in virtually every metric FSU blows UNF out of the water.

If you are lucky enough to have an option to avoid it and to avoid spending your parents savings take it.  Later after college you can take on debt to but a house or new car and I promise you won\u2019t regret the decision.  If you don\u2019t spend mom dads money now on school they can help with a down payment on a house.  You\u2019re an adult now and part of adulting is making decisions based on rational outcomes.  My daughter goes to FSU rather than UF, why because they pay her to attend.  Her boyfriend is paid 20k (after all expenses and tuition) to attend UF. She has friends going to UNF and UCF for the same reason. It\u2019s basically free or they are making money.  The only exception is her buddy going to Vanderbilt.  It was the cheapest option after scholarship.  Her total out of pocket is 5k/year.  Not bad for an 80k/year school and. T20 to boot.  UNF offering good scholarships means they want and value you. If FSU does offer the same you should take it as the value you less and act accordingly .\n\nBtw\u2014- there is rule that says you can\u2019t call FSU and ask them if the can match the UNF scholarship.  Maybe they will and the FSU will be saying \u201cwe want you too\u201d and you can go there.\nGood luck!",

If your child can go in scholarships and grants then it\u2019s easy for me to recommend she should and she won\u2019t regret it.\n\nNow if it were FSU and you had to take 20k /year in student loans vs UNF for free I would tell you UNF.  The educational difference yarn worth 80k in debt before you start work.  \n\nThings you should think about and as you first gen won\u2019t be so obviious.\n1) INTERNSHIPS are important.  You should start applying for summer after freshman year .  You may not get one until junior year but more is better.\n2) FSU HAS A GREAT STUDY ABRIAD program with satellite campuses in places like spain, Italy , Panama.  Talk to the program early about funding opportunities .  These are life changing experiences literally opening the world to our kids.  (I feel so positively about these semester or year abroad, they are one of the few things I would use student debt for) \n3) dorms are a great way for kids to make a lot if freinds quickly when they get to FSU.  Off campus housing is expensive . For first year firm and meal plan is a good ideas. Kid can focus on figuring out school. \n\nFeel free to contact me if you need any specific info.  If I f day int know I can probably point you in the right direction.",

My daughter had 114 college credits , an AA with all pre reqs for engineering and didn\u2019t get accepted by UF.  They actually told to just apply as a transfer junior and they would accept her.  She was so insulted by the idea we\u2019d take you as a junior (this really means no scholarships) but not as a freshman that she immediately accepted her full ride at FSU.  She has a friend a year younger with similar but lesser stats (1170 SAT and \u2018only\u2019 80 college credits from DE ) who was admitted to both (she is also first gen and Latina ) She wanted to go to FSU with my daughter but UF offered better scholarship so guess where she goes UF.  My daughters boyfriend goes to UF why ... they actually pay him $20k/ on top of all school expenses .  Other friends who got into UF attend UCF because it\u2019s free for them and UF is not .at some level we have made school into a dream wedding or dream vacation when it\u2019s not it\u2019s a long term investment like a big machine at a factory or a house.  Society sets the kids up for disappointment, by doing this and it\u2019s a shame.  I promise she will make friends and have a green time at FSU.  I also promise that her fiends attending UF will go y to o Tallahassee to have fun because I\u2019m told the fun at FSY beats Gainesville\u2019s everyday.",

I have so many connections, they host so many networking events with so many firms and companies. I would be so much more behind in my career if I didn't go to FSU and their business events. I have an internship with BMW as a sophomore and I honestly give credit to this school for helping me secure such a position so early on.",

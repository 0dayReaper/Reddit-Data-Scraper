If you're interested, please message me or comment below so that I can add people to the group chat. \n\nDisclaimer: this is VERY seat-of-pants right now, but with luck we should meet sometime later this week in person.",

I'd love to take part in the creation of this club.\n\nI'm the fundraiser at HOSA and the Secretary at a newer program called ENGin at FSU, so I have some experience on the initial stages of an RSO official student organization and how to run them. \n\nFeel free to DM me!",

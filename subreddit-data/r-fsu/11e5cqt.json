    "postText": "Hey guys im fully committed to going to fsu for summer 2023, but i did not get a scholarship from them and this is really making my dad mad. He only wants me to to go to unf, because they gave me a scholarship but i am from jacksonville and do not want to go there. So can you guys help me out to give me genuine academic reasons why fsu is better? Im going to the college of buisness and majoring in finance.\n\nEdit:\nIm extremely lucky and am not gonna have debt either way from the schools which is why i chose fsu. I have bright futures which covers 100% tuition, and i already have 7k in individual scholarships (overall i've applied to 64k dollars worth of scholarships just haven't heard back most come out in april/may) to cover room food and supplies and anything else i could cover out of pocket with my own savings (i have over 10k in savings). My dad just doesn't want me to have to but i would so much rather go to fsu\n\nFinal edit: my dad is going to let me go wherever i want to go, but having his support is important to me because we\u2019ve had a really bad relationship in the past and it\u2019s finally healing. He only prioritizes academics and so that\u2019s what my reasoning mainly has to be.",

Things like finding friends, paying bills and other adult things that come with moving to a new city. If you have experience in starting over, it opens your job prospects to more than just the city you grew up in. \n\n Also, Jacksonville isn't that far, so quick trips home or parents coming over isn't difficult.",

You'll be surrounded by brighter students, you'll be pushed more to succeed because of this, and the overall opportunities for learning are better at FSU vs UNF. \n\nBut the bigger, better thing is that you will be spreading your wings by going to school away from home. If you go to UNF, you'll likely be living at home; and at the very least, you'll still be doing what you have always been doing...living in Jax. It's a good place to live but college is about growth and if you're going to college where you grew up, would you grow as much?\n\nUNF is still largely a commuter school. The roads roll up at 5pm and the campus is mostly dead on weekends. FSU is always \"alive\" and there is always something to do. The entirety of the time you're at FSU, you'll be \"at college\" whereas at UNF, you're taking classes. \n\nBecause of this, FSU's social scene will be better. You're surrounded 24/7 by other college students. You'll be doing more things with them. \n\nUNF is a fine school and if it's all you can get in to, that's great. But it's main purpose is as a way for kids in Jax who can't go away to be able to go to college. You can go away.  And you should. It'll be better in so many ways for you.",

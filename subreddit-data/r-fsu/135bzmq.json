    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm an incoming master's student and I'm looking for Off campus housing. I know it's a little late but finals have been killing me and have to focus on those right now. I wanted to know your opinions on where I should live. I'm a 23 year old dude with a pet (cat) and am looking for an apartment complex/community that has a good vibe and has fun people, preferably students. I am a hard worker when it comes to school but I also like to have fun when I'm off. I like going out, partying, drinking or just having a chill night at the house. Let me know if you can get me any recommendations , if any of you are looking for a roommate DM me I'd be really happy to reply.",

            "comment": "I lived in Indian Village my freshman year (2015) and my roommates were older. All of our neighbors were seniors or grad students! I think we each paid $550 for a 3/2 townhouse with a two car garage, yard, deck, and a perfect view of the stadium. I'm not sure what the rates are now, but definitely the best value I'd gotten. \n\nThe houses are individually owned by either property companies or private landlords. I can get you in contact with my old one if you send a PM! \n\nI'd also look at Jackson Properties. They have houses and townhouses for rent. I lived off of Ocala Rd in one my senior year. A little further from campus but a really nice neighborhood!",

            "comment": "Not an apartment but an area of town. I can not recommend midtown enough. I moved from the around the stadium which is not bad, but tends to be filled with undergraduates and to get anywhere you really need a car. From my spot right now I can walk to at least 8 bars, the grocery store, a bunch of different restaurants, and on an average day it is much quieter than living by the stadium. Plus lake Ella is a nice park located within the area. If you were located right in the middle of midtown, it\u2019d be about a 10 min drive to campus or a 30 min walk.",

They offer 4/4s near college town and is extremely nice\n\nNine times out of ten if you\u2019re looking for fun you\u2019ll go out with your roommates someplace or throw a party, I\u2019m friends with my neighbors from years ago and we still keep in touch",

    "postText": "I just signed the Fall '23-'24 contract a day or so ago. I was searching for off-campus housing but due to the worry I might not find a place in time, I signed the housing contract on campus. And I feel I won't even be able to pay the costs per semester cause on-campus seems to cost way more than just getting an apartment off campus. \n\nConsidering its early in the year rn. I was giving myself till early May or late April (depends but by then for sure) to settle where I gotta live. Is there any leeway in getting out of the contract if it is couple months before the Fall semester even starts? Like without having to pay the full costs? \n\nI am kinda desperate for insight on this cause on-campus just lacks a lot of benefits compared to off-campus imo. And I'm a senior too lol \n\nBut I'd appreciate ANY help.\n\nThank you.",

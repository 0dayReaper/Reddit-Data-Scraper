I am going to be doing an Internship this summer away from Tallahassee and Still need to take classes. All I have are the electives left, but since they dont allow us to take online classes my options are very limited.",

I liked CNT4603 when I took it. (Just spend the time to go through the assignments and write them up nicely. It's an easy A as long as you don't wait until the last minute and take enough time to make sure they're done correctly.) I haven't taken Software Engineering 2, but Software Engineering 1 was terrible when I took it. I think the course has been revised since then though.",

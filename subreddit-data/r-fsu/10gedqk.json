I do t know of anyone who has gotten into the Bridge program without applying for the med program and being declined for that first, as typically it\u2019s used to give a little more missing knowledge to applicants who didn\u2019t make the cut but are otherwise excellent candidates for the med program.\n\nSource: work at the med school and hear things through the grapevine.",

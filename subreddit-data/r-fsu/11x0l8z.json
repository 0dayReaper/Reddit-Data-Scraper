    "postText": "So I just found out from my advisor today that because I took 2 consecutive terms without meeting the required milestones, I have to attend school this Summer or I have to change my major. (I\u2019m a math major if that\u2019s relevant) I had no idea that this was a thing and I had another advisor before that didn\u2019t tell me the milestones needed to be met to stay in the major. I\u2019m actually pretty upset because if my previous advisor would have told me this, l would have scheduled my classes accordingly. But the thing is, I need to take this summer off because I\u2019m having a lot of health problems and I\u2019m also a caretaker for my Dad. What are the chances that I can attend school in the Fall and still stay in my major? Any advice would be so much appreciated. \ud83d\ude4f",

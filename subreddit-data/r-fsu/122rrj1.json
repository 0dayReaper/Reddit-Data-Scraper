            "comment": "most of my CS classes have actually not been in the Love building. I have had classes in Bellamy, Health &amp; Wellness Center (they have classrooms), and Carothers. not going to sugarcoat the fact that the Love building is not a beautiful facility. it is not the worst, but it is not as good as the other buildings on campus. the MajorsLab is in a basement, and the basement is a little dingy, but I personally rarely use it. I have never had a class in the lab, it is just an offered space to those in the major. some stuff I wish I had known about the CS program is that you will not be able to take any of your CS classes online, so if that is a concern, you should know that. I also believe the CS classes here mainly prepare you for a software engineering path - there are electives in networks, security, and more, but I am looking for internships for cybersecurity at the moment and as a junior the majority of my coursework has been in programming so I don't have much to offer in technical experience. professors in the department are either decent or not-so-good, in my experience it is very rare to have a great professor. I still think it is a decent program, and I don't regret coming to FSU. but those are just some things I have learned from being in the program",

Only basement I ever recall being in was Dirac library and of course that wasn\u2019t where any classes were held.",

Back then some ppl didn\u2019t have their own machines so the lab was necessary, technology has changed so much that I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t share desktops to get help.",

In fact I don\u2019t think I set foot in it once. I believe that just means it\u2019s a designated space for CS majors.",

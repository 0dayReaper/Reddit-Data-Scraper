But she loved it so much, I was a part of some of her projects and they can use actors, she came out with her own documentary and worked in a team with other students who had their own roles and spent hours in the editing lab to get it done. I think at one point she did a VR project which was cool. It\u2019s a small and intimate major with smaller sized classes and amazing professors.",

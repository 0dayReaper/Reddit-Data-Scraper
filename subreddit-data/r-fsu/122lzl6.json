    "postText": "Hey everyone :) \n\nI had a question for the juniors and seniors primarily but everyone is free to answer. I have gotten sick more times in my first fall/spring semester at FSU (like 9 times, I wish I was kidding) than I have in the prior past five years of my life (probably more tbh) and no matter what I try I can\u2019t seem to stay healthy. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, any advice on how to stay healthy? \n\n\nFor some additional context, I work out pretty often, try to eat healthy (pollo rice and chicken have become my go to on campus), don\u2019t go clubbing more than 1 max twice a semester, and try to get at least 6-7 hours of sleep a night bare minimum.\n\nFurthermore, I did my senior year of HS at a local community college so I wasn\u2019t really exposed to the general population again until ab a year after most people were seeing one another again. I know that I didn\u2019t have as much time as most to build up an immunity, but I still feel that 9 times getting sick is a bit excessive. \n\nSo my fellow \u2018Noles, any advice?",

I took 6 classes this semester (in hindsight I wish I could go back and slap myself for this) and while 4 of the 6 are hella easy the last two (one of which is managerial accounting\u2026hate that class) are a pain in the neck. \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that I do a lot of research into the financial world and world political events (which we all know is nothing short of a sh*t show rn) and that causes mild stress as well. \n\nI think I may have taken on a bit too much, but at least the semester is almost over \ud83e\udee0",

If you do some research, anything less than 8 is no bueno.",

If you are, sickness spreads really easily there. I'd recommend getting an air purifier for your room and wearing a mask in classes or whenever you're in a large group. It's not ideal, but your immune system will eventually get stronger and/or you'll move out of the dorms.",

My spring in tallahassee, my body literally couldn't handle the pollen. I was coughing and wheezing all the time for like 2 weeks. My nose was stuffed up. It's a different environment.\n\n\n2) sleep. Humans need 7 hours per night minimum to he well rested. Really though, everyone is different and falls somewhere between 7 and 9 hours a night needed. Anything less than that consistently and your immune system will suffer. Also includes quality of sleep. Not sleeping through the night or sleeping under the influence of alcohol, marijuana or even sleeping medication will severely reduce your quality of sleep. Studies show you do not undergo natural sleep cycles when under the influence of depressants.\n\n\n3) Idk where you are from, but this is probably a big jump for you. People who are from small towns tend to get sick much more often as their immune system adjusts to the wide variety of people and germs you are exposed to constantly. \n\n\n4) stress\n\n\n5) once you are sick, your body is more likely to pick up another illness. You are already fighting one pathogen and you are lacking the full energy and immune response to fight others. It is likely that you are getting sick from things that wouldn't have made you sick, if your body hadn't been spending so much time recovering!\n\nConsider being extra careful about how you are feeling. When you feel off, maybe wear a mask (to protect yourself), get an extra hour of sleep, drink lots and lots of water. And definitely don't drink alcohol or go to packed places.",

It started happening again when I got up here and ended up determining that it was just allergies. The pollen up here is crazy it gave me symptoms similar to sinus infections and just overall feeling icky. \nMaybe try giving some daily allergy meds a try? Completely changed the game for me",

Just make sure your getting enough sleep, eating/drinking enough, and cleaning your dorm. I would also try to get an air purifier if you can, that helped me a lot.",

I was not personally deferred but about half of my friends deferred got accepted, and the ones dead-set on going to FSU did a program to transfer. I suggest abroad for a semester if you are offered it! Just sit tight and don't stress, you got this far. And sometimes a school isn't for you but don't sit and wait for the decision, it will come eventually. I don't want to give false hope, but I did have a friend who was deferred and then accepted into the honors program. Weird, but good.",

I had originally applied summer term anyhow and did not think I had the funds to do abroad so I didn\u2019t select that but is there a chance for me to still get in summer? My GPA increased and I added new extracurriculars as well as leader positions within the clubs and new service hours.",

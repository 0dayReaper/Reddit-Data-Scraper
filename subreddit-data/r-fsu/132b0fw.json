    "postText": "So chubbys is closing. I love that place so much. It's been a staple for years. My parents went there. I went there last night and asked why they were closing. Apparently fsu bought them out and they are going to put in a \"standard chicken place\" wtf. I would get it if business is bad but it isn't. That's the only place I can get some good chicken and rice or a chicken rap at 11pm. I hate all these new chicken places coming in. They are all the same. Ugh",

On the application status it's currently at \"under review\". There are 2 more steps after that 1. \"Referred to academic college\" and 2. Awaiting decision.",

Once an app shifts from awaiting materials to under review, it's usually 2-3 weeks before you are either referred to the academic college or you receive a deferral or denial based on something deficient in general university requirements. It may take a little longer for committee review of your high hour statement - this is a busy time of year for transfer apps. \n\nAssuming you pass general university review and committee review of your statement, once your app is referred to the academic college, it's usually 2-3 weeks for a decision. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but that's a good midrange average. \n\nIf your app has been sitting at \"under review\" for 4 weeks or more and hasn't been referred to the college, I'd say it's time to give the admissions office a call and check in on the status.",

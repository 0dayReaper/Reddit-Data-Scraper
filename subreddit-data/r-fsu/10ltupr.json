    "postText": "I'm in Heritage Grove rn, and they are raising the rent to $800 and still having us pay out of pocket for utilities. Living here won't exactly be in my budget next year so I was looking to live somewhere else in the fall. Does anyone have any suggestions that are like $600 or less in rent? Bed/Bath numbers don't matter as I'm fine with 4/4 etc. If not, just any good suggestions in general?",

I reviewed the lease yesterday and they put a cap on the utilities they will cover, the rest will have to be out of pocket and internet/cable isn\u2019t included. It just seems crazy for the price to go up and not get much personal benefit from that.",

Not to sound like a horrible person but my roommate and I pretty much never turn lights off unless we\u2019re sleeping either.\n\nI know the new, upcoming lease is supposed to cover all of utilities and internet - at least that\u2019s the lease I was showed. Although I don\u2019t think I\u2019m staying for that increase since I just graduated",

You could potentially take both precalc and trig over the summer as express courses, calc 1 in fall, then transfer for spring if you need calc as a prereq for your program.",

You wouldn\u2019t have the knowledge necessary without it. Also if you passed calc but failed precalc somehow that puts them in a weird situation giving you a credit for a class you don\u2019t qualify for.",

I had taken precalc in high school but was having a rough day when I did my placement test, so I just took the CLEP and got 5 hours of credit and was able to sign up for calc. \nIf you\u2019ve never taken Precalc, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even take them as express summer classes unless that\u2019s all you had on your schedule. I\u2019ve been tutoring students in Precalc at TCC this semester and the workload is heavy.",

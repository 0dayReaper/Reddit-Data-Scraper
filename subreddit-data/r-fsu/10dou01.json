    "postText": "Recently decided to leave uni due to mental health issues and honestly don't see the reasoning in going back. Sure i'm losing money on my rent by not living in Tally while I decided to take a semester off to refocus on my mental health but was just wondering if other poc despise FSU as much as I do. I always kind of struggled with fitting in at this university (even in cultural clubs where i met other poc) but unfortunately, it just got so bad that I became very depressed and had to come home and live with my parents. While I do miss hanging out with people my age I'm just not sure Tallanasty is the right environment for me. Maybe it's something in the air but was just wondering if other people felt the same way. They really don't warn you about that close-to-graduation/post-graduation depression that comes out of nowhere and basically ruins your life.",

I struggled in the beginning until I determined that my goal was my degree and everything else was part of the journey. 10 years from now, you will realize that you don't see or talk to people you were in school with as your career and family life will be in full swing.",

It made me really sad that all my friends were graduating because just being in such close proximity to people you've known since freshman year and seeing us all leave was honestly so devastating. I made some really good friends by being at fsu despite it being super challenging for me to fit in but I think I'm just going to focus on getting my degree because I honestly got so overwhelmed with planning for the future that it sent me into overdrive and I had to take a break.",

Versus a freshman in your second semester, if you only have 8 classes on your record, one failing grade could cause a bigger dip.",

I'm sorry, but if you're a Junior at FSU and you think that going to reddit is the correct place to get an answer to this question instead of either:\n\n* Googling \"FSU GPA\"\n* Asking your academic advisor\n\nThen you're going to have a bad time out in the real world.\n\nOP should seriously reconsider how they are approaching their college education. Frankly, a Junior failing a class is a massive red flag. I was by no means a great student, but my GPA went *up* when I got to my final two years. \n\nMaybe OP is in the wrong major if they're looking at failing Chemistry as a Junior. But then again, I question if they're really college material if they come to r/FSU instead of the options I mentioned above for getting answers to basic questions.",

This is a D in your chem and lab\n\nAdd this up 265  gpa points\nDivide by total credit 65+13= 78\n\nGpa = 265/78= 3.39 cumulative  so relax your gpa hardly moves at all",

Failure is ok \u2026 it\u2019s what you do next that defines you.  Ask what could I have done different (more homework, go to office hours weekly, find a tutor ) and apply it to the next go round. You\u2019re obviously a diligent student , I\u2019m guessing not STEM so failure isn\u2019t something you\u2019ve experienced .  It happens don\u2019t sweat just move on.",

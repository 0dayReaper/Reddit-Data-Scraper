Description:

A subreddit for FSU students, faculty, alumni, and other interested parties.

Welcome new students! Need to fill your free time or make friends? You can find a list of every student organization and a contact for it on Nole Central!  https://nolecentral.dsa.fsu.edu/

Rules:

No Self-Promotion or Advertisements: Do not post anything that looks remotely related to an advertisement or self-promotion. There is an exception for the advertisements of recognized student organizations and student clubs of Florida State University.

No Personal Info: No personal or private information. This includes phone numbers, email addresses, other social media handles etc.

No Politics: Political posts and comments are not allowed on r/FSU, even if the political content is related to FSU.

No Illegal Activity: Do not discuss or conduct illegal activity on this subreddit.

No "Chance Me" Posts: Do not make new posts asking what your chances of being accepted to the university as a freshman are. Transfer students may post questions, as we understand transfer situations are more nuanced.

r/ChanceMe is a good alternative resource.

No Posts for Subleases / Find-A-Roommate: Subleases, roommate searches etc. are only allowed in the designated pinned thread.

No Homework Posts: No homework posts. Asking for study buddies and GroupMe's is ok, however surveys are not.

r/SampleSize is a good resource to conduct surveys.

Low Karma Accounts / Throwaways: u/AutoModerator automatically removes posts and comments from accounts that are very new, or accounts that have very low karma. 

Moderators will approve posts/comments that have been removed for this reason if they see them, but there is no guarantee they will see them quickly or at all. 

To make your lives easier, do not use throwaways. 

If your only account is new (you are a new redditor) and you need your post approved, you can message modmail.

I know it\u2019s a graduation requirement for FSU, and the Aspire TCC2FSU map lists it as \u201crecommended\u201d for the last semester. If it doesn\u2019t work out to take it while at TCC, will that impact transfer admission to FSU? 3.71 GPA, not a limited access major.",

But no, unless that course is a prerequisite for a major you're applying to, you do not need it to transfer.\n\nYou will need an oral communication course to graduate at FSU, so if you're able to take it at TCC, it gets that requirement out of the way so that you don't have to worry about it moving forward.",

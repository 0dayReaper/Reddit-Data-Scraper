    "postText": "Hey all!\n\nI\u2019m taking Physics A this summer and have seen many peers recommending Skoolers for this course. I have never used Skoolers but am pretty familiar with Clutch Prep, which is a bit more affordable per semester. But if Skoolers will help me more with the FSU course specifically, I\u2019ll get it. \n\nAny thoughts?",

I found Skoolers to be far less helpful over the spring semester for physics than before they changed things. IDK if skoolers adjusted though for this semester",

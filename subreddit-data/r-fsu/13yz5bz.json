They applied as transfer the day the got the  rejection and started the following fall. \nMy daughter graduated with AA (3.7) honors, all engineering pre requisites and was rejected from UF. They actually told her she would be admitted as transfer and invited her to reapply that way.  Of course that meant no freshman scholarships and FSU gave her a bunch.  She is loving her time at FSU.",

Because she qualified as a AA transfer students which is guaranteed under Florida Law, we started applying to UCF, UF, and FSU as an DE transfer student (so 1 year prior to high school graduation) It really confused admissions but interestingly, none ever asked for SAT/ACT.  COVID hit and all transfer progress stopped so I don't know what the final outcome would be.  \n\nIts kind of Dumb,  Students who have their AA have already demonstrated their ability to be successful in college.  There are lots of studies that show the correlation between AA GPA and subsequent GPA at FSU, UF an UCF.   SAT/ACT scores are supposed to be indicators of potential college success, but studies show that they are only reasonably ok when used in conjunction with high school grades.  And they aren't as good as college grades earned in AA.",

    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m going to be attending fsu in the fall, and I was just wondering how international students usually get to campus. Is it a good idea to fly to orlando, and then drive up to campus, or should I go to the tallahassee airport? \n\nThere are flights available to both airports, but the tallahassee airport is a lot smaller, so just wondering which one would be a better option.",

You'll have enough upheaval in your life just coming to a new country, starting school, etc. For the stuff you can control, like which airport to fly into, keep it simple.\n\nConvenience aside, flying into Orlando, then driving up I-75 is not what I would wish for anyone's first impression of the US.",

The nearby airports in Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta are all 3, 4 hours driving away from Tallahassee. I would suggest flying to TLH unless you\u2019re good with driving that long after an international flight",

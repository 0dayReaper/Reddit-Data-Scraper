    "postText": "Hey everyone. So I\u2019m a senior graduating this summer and I have two courses left to take, one which is a dumb easy online course, and then the creative writing Fiction Techniques class with Mark Winegardner. I chose to take it because I think it would be a more creative and critical thinking class and help me improve my skills in writing and lyricism, and I also want at least one last class in person in my final month here at FSU. I have heard some pretty iffy things about the Professor though. I was wondering if anyone could shed light onto whether this course is worth it or if it\u2019s not and I should start looking for another class.",

            "comment": "Hey there, I'm a creative writing major graduating this coming spring, and I took Winegardner's class my sophomore year.  I'm not sure what your major is, but if it's at all writing related, I encourage you to take Winegardner's class.  Winegardner himself can be blunt and harsh with his criticism, which I'm sure is what you've heard, but he isn't cruel, and he's always fair.  If you can separate yourself from your work and take his criticism objectively, you'll see that it's almost always accurate and greatly improves your writing.  He can be long-winded, but he really knows what he's talking about when it comes to writing.  Personally, I found his class to be a breath of fresh air from most writing workshops where everyone just says they love your concept and the only criticisms they have are pointing out a typo or formatting error.  Just make sure you do the readings and the work on time and your grade will be fine, and let yourself hear honestly the advice of an accomplished author on your amateur work.  That's the most important thing to getting the most out of his class.  If you think your writing is already perfect, you'll hate this class because Winegardner will prove you wrong.  If you accept that your writing is amateur and really listen to and understand his criticism, you'll notice a dramatic improvement in your work",

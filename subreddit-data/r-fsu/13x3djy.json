If there is only 1 bar left on Traditions or Woodward, I wouldn\u2019t even try because it\u2019s probably already full and just isn\u2019t registering the car count. If it comes down to it, you can almost always park at the civic center when there isn\u2019t a game or an event. Just don\u2019t park anywhere that says private/reserved lot because they will tow your car in a heartbeat.",

If you\u2019re pulling in right when most classes are ending, your chances of a spot are higher. You\u2019ll still drive around for a while.\n\n3: You can always find parking at the stadium, or in the president house student lot. I have less experience with Spirit way lot, but was always easy for me. (Three lots on different areas of campus)\n\n4: I never drove with a crazy time constraint (i.e. arriving at 11:05 for an 11:10 class, it won\u2019t happen). I always arrived much earlier to study or get food and if parking was bad, it cut into that time. \n\n5: You can always find parking somewhere but you\u2019ll be driving around, possibly walking far, and it is frustrating.\n\nBest of luck to you!",

However, some sororities have \u201chidden fees\u201d, like required clothing, your own transportation to mandatory events, fines for missing said events, etc. that can and do add up",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m currently in a sorority and my dues are about 6k a semester BUT that\u2019s only bc I live in my sorority house. There are generally two prices (out of house dues and in-house dues). In house will be significantly more expensive than out of house for obvious reasons (living, cleaning, breakfast, etc.). And each sorority is different with different expenses for their dues. I\u2019m not sure about spring/COB (continuous open bidding) recruitment but during fall recruitment, there is a whole day dedicated to how much each chapter is (what their dues are/what\u2019s included is the dues). I suggest listening to what each chapter has to say and basing your financial decision based on that. They\u2019ll give a PowerPoint and usually a little paper of everything written down so you don\u2019t have to remember it off the top of your head. Also, if you find a chapter you really like but it\u2019s a little out of your budget I suggest asking the people who are recruiting you about any scholarships they may have. Most chapter\u2019s national organizations give out scholarships, you just have to apply! In general though people in each chapter will always be willing to work with you about financials and whatever you need. Hope this helps a little:)",

For events such as semi-formal, date functions, etc. you usually get a lookbook to match the theme but it\u2019s up to you on what you buy/ if you even attend the event. For recruitment I\u2019d say I prob spent about $200-250 on clothes, nails, makeup. Total of clothes throughout the year though is prob around $300",

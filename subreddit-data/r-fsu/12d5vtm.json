Granted, I came in with a bunch of transfer credits from high school, both of my majors were humanities/social science (so they didn\u2019t need as many credits as some STEM programs), and I had to do a bit of work with academic advising to make sure I hit all the requirements, but under the right circumstances, it can be a viable option, and you can get double the credentials in the same time frame without a ton of extra work. I don\u2019t know about this specific person\u2019s case, but this is the general case for doing an extra minor.",

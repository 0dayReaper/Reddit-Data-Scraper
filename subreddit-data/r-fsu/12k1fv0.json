    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m considering transferring to fsu for poli sci (out of state student) and was wondering what it\u2019s like to be a transfer student here? I also had some questions I\u2019d really appreciate if u guys could answer:\n\n1) is it easy to make friends as a transfer? Any tips you got?\n2) what\u2019s it like to be a minority? (I\u2019m south Asian) I don\u2019t necessarily want to limit myself to just other minorities and would like to branch out to everyone. Is racism an issue? \n2) I\u2019m considering rushing for a fraternity since it\u2019s easier to make friends that way. What\u2019s that like? Is Greek life big? Would it be a problem that I\u2019m gay (&amp; a minority)? I\u2019m not \u201cflamboyant\u201d but not necessarily \u201cmasculine\u201deither(&amp; im actually conservative if that puts things into perspective) but just curious \n3) what\u2019s the housing situation like for a transfer? \n\nAny other insights would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "Hey! So I\u2019ve been at FSU for two years and involved in a few different communities on campus. There\u2019s a space for everyone, generally good and bad, so here\u2019s some of my opinions to your questions:\n\n1. It\u2019s fairly easy to make friends to hang out with and form a little social circle if you make a point to go to events, talk to classmates, and join clubs. Everyone else is feeling like a fish out of water too, you\u2019ve just gotta be the first person to reach out sometimes. I\u2019d highly recommend going to a couple involvement fairs and joining a club you\u2019re interested in. That\u2019s an easy way to meet people with common interests. \n\n2. I\u2019m not the best person to give an opinion on this as a white person, but am basing this on policies and what I\u2019ve observed from my friends. There are currently a lot of issues with the school itself and censorship because it\u2019s a public school and Ron Desantis is the governor, but regarding the students themselves I\u2019ve found most people to have a generally welcoming if not \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d attitude regarding race and sexuality as it is a generally liberal school. I can speak on being nonbinary and queer and can say that I quickly found a group of friends in different places that were very accepting and like minded. I would go to International Coffee Hour at the Globe to branch out and see different people from around the world and from different Florida communities, it\u2019s a great program for FSU and international students plus free food.\n\n3. I don\u2019t know much about traditional Greek life on campus but there are also professional fraternities you can join that do not haze (even though there is a no hazing policy some still do) and are very welcoming! Greek life is huge on campus, the houses are along the border of the campus and the parties are very popular.\n\n4. As a transfer, I would look into apartments immediately. There are a ton of sublease pages on Facebook. The on campus housing situation is honestly a mess and it\u2019s very difficult to get housing on campus without special circumstances. Check out subleases and places further from campus if you can because it\u2019ll be a lot cheaper given the current price gouging.\n\nHope this helps and if you decide to transfer you enjoy Tally!",

I'm an OOS freshman, and on ur second question, i'm east asian and I don't feel like racism is necessarily an issue here. however, i feel kind of weird most of the time because there are barely any asian people. i'm not the biggest fan of it and it makes me feel really strange most of the time. u can always def get over it but i've always just felt a bit odd about the situation and wish that fsu was a bit more diverse",

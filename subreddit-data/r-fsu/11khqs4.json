    "postText": "I lived on Degraff freshman year. I then lived on Saga (Younion) for two years, and loved it! I didn\u2019t resign because I was going to graduate but made the last minute decision to stay one or two more semesters. I toured UClub because it\u2019s on the same area I\u2019ve lived the whole time. While it\u2019s beautiful, the total added cost is around $950 including utilities and parking. Would you recommend it? Do you feel safe inside, and walking at night?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently here too and I do like it, I pay like $760 + util right now and it\u2019s a super walkable distance from campus especially if you\u2019re a stem/psych major and the amenities are nice but I personally think the price is a little too crazy so I\u2019m moving out at the end of my summer lease. But the rooms are huge and having a downstairs bathroom is soo nice if you plan on having people over. Plus the kitchen is massive.\n\nStudent apartments are getting expensive in general, I think you could totally find something for nicer and cheaper farther away from campus but it being so close is hard to beat. If you\u2019re ok with the price being near 1 grand I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad place. I\u2019ve never felt unsafe and I walk a lot but there have been like a couple car break ins but I think they\u2019re few and far in between and all happen closer to the gate entrances",

I\u2019ll list my experiences:\npros:\n- my rent was $714+utils (utilities was high bc I ran the AC)\n- maintenance will come same day or next day \n- office staff, packages, gym, pool are always nice, clean, and overall good\n- super close to campus\n- VERY uncommon around Tally, but, the gates to get into the complex ALWAYS worked. It was never left open \u201cbc of maintenance\u201d or some bad excuse other places will tell you. \n- pretty quiet and if your roomies are noisy on a different floor, you won\u2019t really hear them too much!\n- soooo much visitor free parking\n- security drives around at night \n\ncons:\n- not near college town, or stadium (gameday sigh)\n- the carpet is like bowling alley carpet from 1000 years ago \n- wifi is meh\n- trash could be a *far walk. (*I\u2019m lazy, but it\u2019s not too bad)\n- I like sunlight and windows so unless you get bedroom B or D, you get a tiny window\n- not the best surrounding area",

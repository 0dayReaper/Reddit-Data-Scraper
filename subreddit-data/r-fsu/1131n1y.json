    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI\u2019m graduating this spring and trying to order my cap and gown, but the website is confusing. Since I\u2019m getting both a BS and BA (Psychology and Philosophy respectively):\n\n1. Which degree do I pick for the cap and gown? I\u2019m only allowed to pick one for some reason.\n\n2. How many tassels are we supposed to order? FSU says I must purchase two for my two degrees but there\u2019s no option to do so (plus we can only where one during the ceremony). Do I order a tassel for my majors, my college (since both my majors are within Arts and Sciences), or is there a general bachelors one?  \n\nThank you!",

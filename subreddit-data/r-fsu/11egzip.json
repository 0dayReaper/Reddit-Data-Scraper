No idea what Calc 3 + actuary is but generally if you're taking the same course overlapping then it can be easier because you are learning the same concepts.\n\nWhy on earth would they make you take both classes tho? Double check to make sure that taking both will actually provide progress towards your degree. It is possible that it's an either/or situation.",

            "comment": "Calc 3 is easy, and differential equations is easy to mildly challenging. The amount of work you have to do will vary based on the teacher and how much homework they give. For example, my Calc 3 teacher didn\u2019t give homework, but others may. MAP4170 on the other hand was horrible. Honestly was probably the hardest math class I have ever taken. It is doable to pair all 3 together but if you get paired with a homework excessive teacher in 5 credit hour Calc 3 class and MAP4170, then you may be in trouble. I assume you\u2019re an actuarial science major, but if you are not, then I\u2019d just recommend self studying the exams with coaching actuaries.",

            "comment": "Hey there, I came in as an ActSci major and passed FM after taking 4170. If you're choosing between those, I would go MAC2313 and MAP4170. ODEs is fun if you're someone who likes calc, and I know it's an elective option, but there just aren't a ton of applications of it to entry-level actuarial work. I'd say Linear Algebra would be more beneficial at that point. If you're planning on doing the SOA Quant track or going for a Master's in Quant Finance or Financial Engineering, then it'd be a different story.\n\n\nAs long as your math skills are up to snuff and you're not killing yourself with gen eds in the same semester, the combo is doable. My Calc 3 load was heavier than MAT, but I didn't take them at the same time.",

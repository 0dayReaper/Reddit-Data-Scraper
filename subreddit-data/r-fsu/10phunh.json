    "postText": "I submitted a transfer application about 8 weeks ago for the online criminology program. I was referred to the academic college, but my status hasn't changed since then. I even reached out to one of the advisors from the school of criminology, and have not received an email back. Should I worry? Some additional info: 3.9 GPA transferring from a CC in central FL.",

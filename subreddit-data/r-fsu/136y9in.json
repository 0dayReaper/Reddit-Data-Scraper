    "postText": "I am wondering whether or not there is a big difference in getting a degree in Economics vs. Interdisciplinary Social Studies (ISS). I believe ISS is a much easier route however many people say the degree is not as helpful as Economics post-grad. Does anyone have any input on this decision? I am prioritizing doing what I want to do I am just looking for some external opinions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I havent looked too deeply into ISS but my major problem with the current Economics program is its lack of any sort of actual focus and how short the program is. I completed the Economics degree in about 3 semesters, and while I wouldnt go so far as to say it was easy, it certainly wasnt particularly difficult. ISS sounds like an even less focused way for you to study economics (assuming that was what you had in mind) and Economics is not such a difficult degree that losing that little concentration it gives you for an \u201ceasier\u201d degree would be worth it.\n\nAlso, I dont know why this shootsickmoon guy shows up on every single FSU Econ post, he absolutely has to be getting paid for it, but the last time there was any sort of significant story about FSU and the Koch brothers was like 2014. In none of the dozen economics classes that I took was there any overarching \u201cKoch influence\u201d or anything, and Ive never heard a hint of anyone looking down on FSU Econ undergrads for that from anyone except him.",

There is literally climate change denial in this textbook, as well as a special chapter added that blames the 2008 financial collapse on the government. It is not a reliable source of information and its slant favors the corporate donors that back the department. A similar text is used for microecon.\n\nAnyone have a recent syllabus?\n\nhttps://www.coursehero.com/file/58854305/ECO-2013-Fall-2019-Syllabus-2pdf/",

This is well known within the economics world, and economists look skeptically at econ degrees from FSU.\n\nHere is an in-depth report on the [history of Koch donor influence at FSU econ](https://ia601903.us.archive.org/7/items/FSUUnKochCaseStudy2017/FSU%20UnKoch%20Case%20Study%202017.pdf), as well as the numerous department and university policies that were violated in the process. While the programs have been renamed, and reorganized under the auspices of the Hilton center, the problem is the same.\n\nEdit: also, this subreddit has a nasty habit of downvoting me to hide the matter, but I can assure you everything I'm describing is well documented. You can simply search \"Florida State\" and \"Koch\" if you want to learn more yourself.",

You can get into top MBA programs from wither school.  (Ideal case Wharton, Harvard MBA, Vanderbilt etc.)\n\nIf you are from Florida, then it is a no brainer, FSU will cost substantially less and so you'll have more available for grad school which will be expensive.l",

I know I won\u2019t be able to control and predict everything, but I want to set myself up for success. I\u2019m already looking into how I can network and join different business and econ-related clubs/societies as well as leadership eventually. Not sure if being in the honors program will help me.",

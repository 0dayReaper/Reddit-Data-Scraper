Will that disqualify me from applying? I wasn\u2019t aware of UROP until I got to FSU so I couldn\u2019t apply by then.",

No one reported having a good experience. The program is very standardized, and there is a very small chance you will work on projects that you\u2019re actually interested in. Additionally, in the colloquium, you will have to do time consuming projects that are not relevant to your research.",

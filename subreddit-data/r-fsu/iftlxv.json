I was in Strozier at noon having problems. Decided to just go back to my apartment off-campus and Canvas worked like a breeze the rest of the day on my private WIFI. Didn\u2019t know it would make a difference! Of course, for those living on campus...you can\u2019t help but use FSU\u2019s WIFI. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t stay this way.",

Starbucks might become a good option.",

    "postText": "Two questions: \n1. I\u2019m a recently admitted 1st year student and currently NFA into the Interior Design and Architecture program.  Does anyone have any insight/advice about the degree at FSU?\n\n2. Also, I currently own a 2020 MacBook Air and I know that it\u2019s not powerful enough to run the necessary softwares so I was planning to sell this one and purchase a different pc with the required specs according to the department\u2019s specifications.\nHowever, I saw on the website that they only recommend purchasing a new computer after you\u2019ve been formerly admitted into the program after the first year review since you\u2019ll primarily need it for studio starting in the second year. So my question is- does anyone know if my current computer will be enough to get me through my first year courses?",

            "comment": "My bf is about to graduate from the program. It definitely has its pluses and minuses, I just asked him what he\u2019d say for somebody about to enter it for the first time. \n\nPros\u2014 he\u2019s set up very well for after graduation. He has a good internship at a local firm, an interview offer from one of the biggest firms in the country, and at least one grad school acceptance. He has a very solid portfolio. The school offers pretty good resources for finding stuff like internships and jobs. One of the bragging points of the program is that something like 97% of alumni have an industry job within a year of graduation. He was automatically nominated for a few scholarships and won them. He has had some professors who have offered great mentorship and helpful feedback. He says he\u2019s never had a bad professor and that the teachers are one of the real strengths of the program. The TAs have always been fantastic\u2014 he had one who assisted in most of his classes all the way through and several members of his cohort cried when she left. He has really learned a lot and has a lot of different types of career options open to him from here. When it goes well, it can be incredibly rewarding. \n\nCons\u2014 the program is INTENSE. There have been times where he had to lock himself in the studio overnight and work for 12 hours straight without even a bathroom break to meet a deadline. Most of his cohort pulls at least one all nighter a week, if not more. He still averages maybe 7 hours of sleep a night and until he got used to the rigor of the program was barely functioning, he hardly had time to eat or shower or clean up his room. It is incredibly stressful\u2014 somatic symptoms and hair loss type of stressful. You cannot have a typical \u201ccollege experience\u201d with a busy social life and clubbing if you want to do well in the major. There\u2019s homework every single day and often the professors will announce new assignments with a 24 or 48 hour turnaround. There are a fair number of required classes that feel like busywork/filler. If you can\u2019t get an internship your junior/senior year, you straight up can\u2019t graduate, even though that\u2019s kind of out of your control. During the lead up to first year review he watched people break down in tears and drop out in the middle of class more than once. If you are doing this as a stepping stone to get your M.Arch, you can pick a less grueling undergrad major and achieve that anyway. A lot of people seem to pick this program because they think they\u2019re getting something akin to a studio arts degree with better job security. There are definitely creative aspects to it but it\u2019s maybe 60% non-creative: lots of things like memorizing building codes, filling out paperwork, and fighting with 3D render software on less-than-exciting minute details. Sometimes it can be really difficult to parse what the expectations are for an assignment and if you guess wrong you do just lose the points. There can be lots of extra costs so make sure you have money available for things like model building materials, software, printing, etc\u2014 maybe a couple hundred dollars each semester. You functionally do not have a thanksgiving or spring break\u2014 you\u2019ll have too much work to take the time off. Weekends also tend to follow this principle unless you bust ass during the week to enforce your free time, and even then there are no guarantees. There are multiple required extracurricular events each year which can be really time consuming and stressful. Know that the first year is designed to weed you out\u2014 in his cohort, around 150 people enrolled as NFA and around 30 made it to the second year. See the aforementioned bit about people dropping out in the middle of class. One of the rules for a class he took first year was that if you didn\u2019t get a perfect score (which was very hard to do\u2014 if you wrote one letter imperfectly you had to restart handwriting an entire poster from the beginning) you had to redo the assignment from scratch before the next class. One of the projects at the end of the semester was to (perfectly) redo all of the work you\u2019d done all semester long and you only had about a week to do so. They demand perfection\u2014 you will end up producing incredible work by the end of it, but they\u2019ll put you through the wringer to get you there. Definitely have a backup major in mind. \n\nOther things to know\u2014 the following aren\u2019t objectively good or bad but you definitely should know about them before getting into it. You absolutely must be good at self-regulating. You will need to manage your time and self-teach a LOT. If you procrastinate you WILL fail. Oftentimes proficiency in softwares are expected without much instruction in them. Get good on your own at Photoshop and Illustrator. There is very little hand-holding, especially in the junior and senior years. Most of your interaction with the professors in these later years happens when they\u2019re reviewing your work, there\u2019s not much direct instruction. If you love independent work you\u2019ll do well with that, the studio classes tend to be kind of like a study hall. A big theme of the program is that there\u2019s a lot of breadth but not much depth\u2014 you get very good at one or two things (Revit and AutoCAD, for example), but there\u2019s a lot you just dip your toes in. The projects are very varied\u2014 this is great if you don\u2019t know yet what you want to do, but if you fall in love with something you won\u2019t get to spend much time with it (e.g. there\u2019s one residential design project, one healthcare project, one restaurant project, one hotel project, etc etc). You must be absolutely positive that you love what you are doing or you will hate your life\u2014 be very, very sure that this is what you want before committing to it. \n\nRegarding your laptop, if it can run photoshop you\u2019ll be fine for the first year. The first year\u2019s work is done almost exclusively by hand anyway\u2014 poster board models, architectural lettering, etc. so you should be okay until you know if you\u2019re fully admitted. \n\nBest of luck and feel free to reach out if you have any more questions!",

Nothing is optimized for Mac, and that's true for engineering or any other program that requires design software.\n\nIf your budget is not a concern, just go ahead and get yourself a really nice windows laptop, and if you get something powerful enough then guaranteed a windows will be able to run anything you need.\n\nYou could go with a Microsoft surface BOOK (not Microsoft surface pro, unless you like how small it is), or any other high performance Microsoft computer. \n\nIf budget is a concern, then you will be fine just \"getting through\" your first year classes with your mac to buy you some time.",

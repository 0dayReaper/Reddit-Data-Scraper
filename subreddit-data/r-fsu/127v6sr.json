    "postText": "So I applied for the honors program for regular decision and got deferred. Well I got my decision back and was accepted, yay!, but didn't get any news whether or not I was accepted into honors. It just shows me that I submitted everything and we'll receive news when we get our decisions. Since it doesn't say whether I got in or not should I assume I didn't?\n\nSorry if this was a confusing post, but thank you in advance!",

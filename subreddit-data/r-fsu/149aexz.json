            "comment": "From what I understand, the authorization allows federal aid to pay for amounts due that are not specifically authorized by Title IV. So if there\u2019s a fee due that\u2019s not already paid for automatically and you\u2019ve granted the additional authorization, the aid will pay for that fee and the refund would be reduced by that amount. If you don\u2019t grant the authorization, that fee wouldn\u2019t be paid (and you\u2019d receive a bill for it) and the refund amount wouldn\u2019t be reduced. In my understanding, they can\u2019t keep your refund for a future term\u2019s fees. \n\nI do not work for Financial Aid or Student Business Services so you\u2019ll probably have to verify this is correct with one or both of those offices.",

FSU won\u2019t hold the money if you sign the Title IV agreement\u2014 we\u2019ll apply your financial aid to all of the charges on your account for the current term and then refund the difference. If you receive federal money and do not sign the agreement it just means that we will pay tuition and housing and then refund the remainder to you even if you still owe for dining, books, etc. \n\nBut totally up to you which route to go!",

She starts summer B. The tuition and housing payments are due by July 7. Without bright future money , her grants will not cover tuition/ housing and meal plan. Is there a grace period for the payments? Not sure how the bright future works, it does not show up on her fsu finances awards yet, I assume because she doesn\u2019t have the IB diploma until the scores come out",

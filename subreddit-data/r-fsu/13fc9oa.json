    "postText": "I am taking RMI2302 w/ Dr. Nyce online over the summer and am wondering if anyone knows if the exam questions are only the module (multiple choice) presentation questions he goes over in the videos, or are the assignment/non-multiple-choice presentation questions integrated as well? I know there's nothing on the readings, but just wondering if I just memorized the 5/6 questions from each video if I would be good for the exam? Thanks!",

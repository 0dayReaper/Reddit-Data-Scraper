    "postText": "So, there was another thread about this subject but all the replies are from like a decade ago, so I thought I'd ask for an updated response. I'm going to be a freshman this year starting summer b, and just registered for my classes. Some of my classes are on opposite sides of campus, so I was thinking that bringing my bike would help me not feel as stressed getting to class on time. However, whenever I go to campus, I always see destroyed bikes and stuff. Is there any way I can keep my bike from getting stolen/broken by someone, and is it even still really an issue anymore? Also, are there alternative personal transportation options that I could try? I know that there are rentable e-scooters, so how good/reliable are those?\n\nPoll below: Should I bring my bike to FSU?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13so9jv)",

Might be a pain to do every day, but it's one of the best ways to keep your bike safe. Even if you bring only your front wheel up and have the rest locked, people will steal the back wheel or the seat to make your bike unrideable. Also, don't be dumb like me and assume that bike thieves take the summer off.",

            "comment": "A bike lock would obviously be the most important, however I believe that you are technically allowed to have bikes in your dorm room as long as your roommate permits it. You can also look into registering it your bike with FSU PD through this link: [https://police.fsu.edu/services-resources](https://police.fsu.edu/services-resources)\n\nAlso if you still want to bike around campus but don't want to bring your own personal bike, you can rent one through the FSU reCycle bike program, although I'm not sure if its open during the summer.\n\nAny other bike information can be found here: [https://transportation.fsu.edu/bicycles](https://transportation.fsu.edu/bicycles)",

Unfortunately lines for food are long during the year and I doubt you\u2019ll have time to get food and cross campus if it\u2019s a 15-20 minute walk. Walking is faster than the bus if you\u2019re on a tight timeframe",

It's way less stressful than dealing with parking. Ride slowly on campus. Nearly everyone has headphones in and can't hear you, even if you give an \"On your left!\".",

If you are super worried take your seat off at night as well. A bike cuts down travel time significantly. On top of that the buses have bike racks on them so if you have class all up hill you can toss it on the front of the bus and ride it down hill on the way home.",

Besides that, the rentable electric scooters do NOT work on campus. They\u2019re a red-zone and will not go. I suggest buying your own electric scooter/skateboard on Amazon if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. I have an electric scooter and it is absolutely great and easy to get around with!",

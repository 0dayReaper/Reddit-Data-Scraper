    "postText": "hi guys, so i got my acceptance to fsu yesterday and am elated but a little worried about the cost. i was wondering if you guys had any tips on getting the cost down (besides outside scholarships)? ideally, having in state tuition after my freshman year would make it the cheapest school i\u2019m looking at (for a four year total). i know they make it pretty clear that they won\u2019t give in state if you\u2019re living in florida for enrollment purposes only, but fsu is my top choice, so anyway i can make this possible i would. let me know any insight you have at all.",

            "comment": "Mentioning this because it\u2019s something I did not know until years later. FSU PC Campus offers in state tuition for several surrounding counties in GA &amp; I believe AL. So if you are from any of those I\u2019d look into that first. \nPC Campus also offers some courses (I think it may be limited to CS courses) at a discounted rate. If you are a CS major I would highly recommend taking the first few semesters at main campus but switching to PC Campus asap to save soooo much money. If you aren\u2019t a CS major I\u2019m not sure how useful this info will be for you (sorry). \nAlso they most definitely will not reclassify you as in state if it appears you moved to FL for school. Despite having a full time job in FL for years and being a resident in literally every way (I still live in FL lol) they wouldn\u2019t reclassify me because I started August 2015 and moved to FL July 2015. If you\u2019re trying to go the reclassification route, I advise waiting a year or so after you start to move into FL and get all applicable documents after then. \nHope this helps!",

But yes after u submit that dean form it should just be dropped within a week it will show a W on your current class schedule. U can stop showing up, canvas might stay for a while tho",

You should check it with your exact enrollment situation as you are on the bubble at 12 credit hours as you normally would need 12 credit hours in Fall and Spring to keep it, but there are scenarios where you could have additional credits you took in another semester allowing you to meet the requirements.

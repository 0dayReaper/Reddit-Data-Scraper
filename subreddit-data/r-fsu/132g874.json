Nope they provide no help whatsoever with connecting you to those. \u201cOpportunity to take special classes\u201d also nope. Those classes are the medical response unit classes that you can only take if you apply and get accepted. I also strongly disliked the people in charge of the program as they only provided surface level information about med school in the colloquium class and it felt like a waste. I will say however, I did enjoy living in reynolds hall and living with students with similar interests. Feel free to pm me with any questions.",

Honestly, the only perks we\u2019re living with people that had interests the same as you, and a majority of folks on your hall will end up in the same first year classes as you (half my hall was in chem 1 and 2 with me). Living in reynolds was a perk for sure, but as the above post says, the \u201copportunities\u201d are oversold. The only opportunity we had was to obtain first aid/cpr certifications. I will also add- only two people within the entire LLC  class ended up going to medical school. All my roommates switched majors, myself included, and most switched out of pre-med. Its competitive out there!",

Union is great and lots of natural lighting. Strozer 1st or 2nd floor are also great options. Random buildings around campus are also nice, I\u2019d suggest the William-Johnson Building has some cool areas.",

There are tables literally everywhere and plug-ins along the walls etc. You will most always find a seat/table on the first floor. The \u201cmezzanine\u201d (in between the first and second floor), is nothing but tables to sit and study. Ample table, chairs, and plug-ins. The basement of the Union has bowling, a bar, and a few other places. It\u2019s a bit quieter down there and is also filled with tables to sit. Looks up some pictures online, I think it\u2019ll give a good idea to you what to expect!",

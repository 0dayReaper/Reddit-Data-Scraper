He's rough around the edges with a dry sense of humor but his quizzes are the fairest out of all of the Physics professors I've taken. I took lecture based for 2048C, hated it, Studio based seems like a better use of time for me because I feel like with the STEM professors here the lecturing is kinda useless because you have to teach yourself everything regardless LOL. That's just my personal take, I love him and his class, I'm not sure why he has low reviews. If you want to ask more questions about how our syllabus is laid out etc. you can pm me!",

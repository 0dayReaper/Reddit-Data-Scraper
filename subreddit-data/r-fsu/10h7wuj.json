    "postText": "I am bringing my daughter to FSU for a campus tour on 2/20. Any current students willing to give us a tour that day? Someone in life sciences preferred but not essential. We would compensate you for your time.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses and messages. We have it arranged. The response speaks well of the FSU community!",

Although even as a junior, there are buildings I have not been in. \n\nIf you are willing, the name and order of the buildings on your daughter's schedule would be helpful, so I could take you to the buildings in order and she can know how to arrive at her classes in the following semester.",

We both lived on campus last year and can talk about the dorm experience. We\u2019ve also explored the campus a lot and have walked through almost all the buildings (did you know there\u2019s a Macy\u2019s model store in the Johnston building?) We have given tours to family members several times and are able to give a ~30 minute tour of campus without doing any doubling back. We could show you both the main buildings as well as some of the cooler, lesser known places as well. PM me if you are interested!",

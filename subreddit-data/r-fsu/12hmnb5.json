Some universities take a while to send transcripts, so you can enroll at FSU conditionally and you\u2019re fine as long as you show your transcript with the conditions met soon enough. Personally, I transferred here this semester and they didn\u2019t receive my final transcript until ~6 weeks after the semester started.\nJust make sure that you are completing the requirements for admission\u2026 I dont know what happens if you fail to meet them and would rather unit find out",

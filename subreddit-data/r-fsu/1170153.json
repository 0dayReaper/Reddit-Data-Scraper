So two roommates, everyone gets their own bathroom and rent is separate for each person. $890 + electricity which is usually like $20-30 every couple months. It\u2019s so much nicer than the dorms. I can cook food and I have my own room and bathroom. I can burn candles and don\u2019t have an RA or mandatory hall meetings or whatever to deal with. I can hang stuff on the walls with nails. It\u2019s so nice to not have to move out every summer and all of my things are still here when I come back in the Fall.",

Because of that experience, I would never live in the same room ever again. Not that it was traumatizing, it\u2019s just you\u2019re old enough to have your own sense of individuality and you don\u2019t really get that in the dorms.

HOWEVER they are raising base rates to $899 and that does not include utilities so I am moving out at the end of the summer because I can\u2019t afford nearly paying 1k a month lol.\n\nI just signed a lease for a 4x2 house at $375 a month. If you have 3 roommates in mind/can find people to lease with I would definitely recommend looking at student houses. Most properties come with a nice back yard and plenty of space for under $500 a month. Student apartments are just way too expensive\n\nAlso I lived in a dorm last year and the really only benefit to it is you don\u2019t have to worry about commuting and it\u2019s a good way to meet people as a freshman. But on campus dining doesn\u2019t compare to both quality/price you get with cooking for yourself so I don\u2019t miss it. Having your own bathroom and room after sharing with 2-4 people is a luxury.",

You\u2019ll get a lot more space and more privacy so i would def recommend looking into it! you also don\u2019t have like RA rules to follow and it makes for a pretty fun college experience imo. How many people you live with depends on how much you want to pay. I live alone right now and with utilities it\u2019s about $1,100. I\u2019m also about a 8-10 min drive away from campus, one bedrooms are going to get really expensive the closer to campus you get, especially those in student housing apartment complexes. they range from 1,500 on the lower end to 2,000 on the higher end. I used to live in a 4x4 right by campus and my rent with utilities was around $800, and that place did leases per bedroom so i was not responsible at all if my roommates didn\u2019t pay rent, but i do know that place specifically has gone up in rent since i lived there i believe it\u2019s about $1000 per person for a 4x4 now. I honestly believe many student housing options are a scam considering how much you\u2019re paying. You can find traditional leases that will be the same overall price as just one person in student leasing places. I recently lived in a 3x2 about a 5 min drive from campus and the entire apartment was $1500 meaning i only had to pay about $500 for rent plus utilities. The closer you get to campus, the more expensive it\u2019s going to be. a house could be a great option but i\u2019ve found they\u2019re harder to find and even harder to find one when you need it, but again the rent would end up being cheaper. if you\u2019re doing random roommates then student housing might be a nice option as they can do roommate matching and you don\u2019t have to worry so much about them paying rent, they also have a lot of nice utilities so for some it\u2019s worth it to pay more. There\u2019s really a lot of options for off campus i think you should look into if you want a little more freedom and privacy!",

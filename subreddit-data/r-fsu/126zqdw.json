    "postText": "Hello I\u2019m an out of state transfer from Texas and I\u2019m wanting to transfer to FSU next fall (2024). By next spring I should have all my pre requisites completed and over 60 credits. Was just wondering is the business school hyper competitive like UFL? Or if I complete my pre reqs and have over a 3.3 gpa I should be fine?",

Your only downside (maybe upside but..) is being OOS. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t gotten an AA the transfer to TCC for 15 credits and graduate with AA. From there you are pretty much guaranteed admission especially with your gpa.  It\u2019s actual law you will be accepted to one of Floridas universities with an AA fr m one of the colleges.  TCC generally feeds directly into FSU and your GPA pretty much makes it a slam dunk.",

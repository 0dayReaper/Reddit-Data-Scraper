    "postText": "Some background:\n\nI received my AA from TCC in 2013, and transferred to USF at that time.  I graduated from USF with a BS in Environmental Biology and a GPA of 2.63. I have worked in the professional realm as an Environmental Specialist since I could find a job with the state in early 2018.\n\nI work with several environmental engineers and have decided that I would like to return to school to seek a second BS in Environmental Engineering from FSU. I have already ordered transcripts and am currently in the application process, but I can't find much information on the requirements for students seeking a second Bachelors aside from being treated similarly to senior transfer students. I also do not see an option to submit a statement of purpose or anything other than my transcripts and personal information. \n\nDoes an AA from TCC still guarantee admission all this time later,  and after transferring and graduating from a different school? If not, will my existing degree increase my chances of admission, given that my graduating GPA is less than 3.0?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!",

The bright side of that is it'll give you a chance to take some classes and do well in them as a non-degree student. Some recent As will go a long way toward making that earlier rough GPA irrelevant.",

From what I've read, they can accept you as a \"pre-engineering\" student while those pre-requisites are being taken. \n\nI guess a more straightforward question would be; what are the chances of being accepted to FSU in general as a \"Post-Bacc Undergraduate Second Bachelors External\" applicant with my previous education,  and did my AA from TCC still hold any value during consideration, in regards to the TCC2FSU program?\n\nSo long as I can be admitted to the university I'm okay with not being admitted immediately to the College of Engineering. We all start somewhere,  I just want to start!",

That may mean 3+ additional years of school. \n\nThe good news is that because Florida uses a standardized course numbering system, any relevant classes you took and passed from USF should count towards your list of classes you need to graduate.",

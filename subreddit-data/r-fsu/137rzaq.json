This is how they get their funding: [https://controller.vpfa.fsu.edu/services/accounting-reporting/fund-structure](https://controller.vpfa.fsu.edu/services/accounting-reporting/fund-structure)\n\nSecond, I find it highly unethical for the university, after charging students tens of thousands of dollars, to add a survey as a requirement of getting their degree that they already earned. Personally I wish that every graduate would enter in garbage/random answers to make the survey results completely useless.\n\nWant good results? Raffle off multiple prizes each year, such a pass for a booster-lot spot during football games, season tickets, champions club seats for a couple games, to respondents. You know, allowing the students, whose tuition DOES help fund the school, access to some of the fancy non-academic facilities that they and our tax dollars went towards. The university absolutely has space to add a small handful of people to each of these as rewards.\n\nBut adding a BS gate preventing people from getting the thing that they already paid for and earned? That's pretty fucked.",

It has an impact, it's just not a major one.\n\nKnowing who you are, I figure you know all of this, but I'll include it for non-staff/faculty members:\n\nFunding from the legislature is largely part of the Performance Based Funding Model ( [https://www.flbog.edu/finance/performance-based-funding/](https://www.flbog.edu/finance/performance-based-funding/) , item #2 for details).\n\nUnder the model, 9 metrics are used with a 10th being chosen by the Board of Trustee's. 7 of those 9 metrics have zero to do with graduates once they leave (they are things such as the avg cost to a student, 4 year graduation rates, retention rates, Pell grant stats, degree fields, GPA stats, etc).\n\nOnly 2 items, Metric 1 and 2, pertain to graduates once they leave. Percent of Bachelors Graduates Employed (making 40k+ a year) or continuing their education, and Median Wages of Bachelor's Graduates employed full time.\n\nSo, out of multiple sources of funding (where tuition/fees is a significant source), one source only has 2 out of 10 metrics that are dictated by this survey. For reference, the 2022 operating budget was over 2 billion dollars and IIRC, only $88.7M was from the state.\n\nSo ultimately yes, it impacts funding. A little.\n\nThat said, feelings/emotions aside, the two metrics involved in the survey deal with details that are not decided for many graduates. Maybe it's easier these days to find a job before you graduate and I'm just wrong about this part, but the majority of my classmates \\~10 years ago in a STEM field did not have their careers lined up at time of graduation. Additionally, the survey is not fact checked, so how could the state reasonably tie a significant portion of funding to self-reported data, that is incomplete due to timing, unverifiable, and subject to change (claims to pursue a master, changes mind, etc).\n\nEDIT: For additional money details, see page 19 of ( [https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PBF-Information-2022-23.pdf](https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PBF-Information-2022-23.pdf) ) to see that FSU received the second highest allocation of 88M, second to UF's 108M. FSU also scored pretty low in Metric 1, multiple years running. If the survey is so important (and by extension, graduate salaries), then (it is my opinion) they should be focusing on academic buildings and supplies, not another football practice facility. But the numbers still show that, unfortunately, athletics and other sources bring in far more money to the university.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'll be graduating this weekend and I wanted to know what graduation/commencement procedures will be like. I don't believe it'll be anything too difficult, , but I was curious  if there's important things I should know that can't be found on the FSU commencement website. \n\nI also wanted to know if there's any suggestions on handling your personal belongings. I was planning on bringing a small clutch. And when I have to walk across stage, I was gonna leave my clutch and phone on my chair. Would that be fine? And are they really strict about what kind of clutch/purse you can bring?\n\nThank you!",

Students with an FSUCard can get free parking at the St Augustine Garage if you show your FSUCard. Once at the Civic Center, there\u2019ll be a security line specifically for graduates to enter from and a separate security line for families/guest to enter. Here, graduates will scan their grad pass and guest scan their pass.\n\nAs the graduate, you will go down the escalators. At the bottom floor, **Master\u2019s and PhD students will step to the side to have their hoods corrected.**\n\nEveryone will find their assigned seating by finding their name on a yellow card and a commencement booklet. **(Tip: bring a pen if you need to write down your phonetic name pronunciation ~~or any honors you\u2019ve received.~~)**\n\nWhen it is your time to walk, you will bring the card that has your name with you and leave all belongings on or under your seat. Before you get on stage, you will have your photo taken *very quickly*. Once on stage, you will relinquish your card, have your name read, walk across the stage, shake the President\u2019s hand and walk off the stage. You will then *quickly* take 2 more photos and go back to your seat.\n\nI don't think they were strict about the clutch you bring. I brought a clutch both times and had no issues.\n\nCongratulations to all graduates and go \u2018noles!!!!!",

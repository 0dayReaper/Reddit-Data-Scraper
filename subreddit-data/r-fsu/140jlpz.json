About 45% of freshman with engineering as their intended major fail out before completing the pre engineering.  So work on the pre and succeed and you will be admitted to COE.",

You may have to wait until next year - but could still take prerequisites if you are committed.",

The engineering majors have quite a bit of prerequisite coursework that you would be able to start working on alongside your liberal arts courses.  Orientation would be a good time to change your major, though its possible to do so later on as well.",

I\u2019m not entirely sure what the other poster was going on about, but as far as I know engineering does not have a competitive admissions program. The pre-reqs to be fully accepted into the major can just take a little time (eg calc1/2 and maybe 3, physics, etc). You may have to declare yourself an exploratory major and focus on taking all the pre-engineering reqs instead of officially being a pre-engineering major from the start.",

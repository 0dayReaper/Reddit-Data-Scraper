    "postText": "Hii, I\u2019m from Orlando but I will attend FSU, I just got accepted two days ago as a transfer student for the fall term. I was registering for orientation and there were two dates available, one in July 6th and the other one in August 24th. I know classes start august 28th so I was planning on moving to Tallahassee the first week of august but if I want to register for classes I should get orientation done as soon as possible right? I\u2019m so lost, thank you!!",

They told me I am not on the list at the housing check-in. I  checked my email and found out my orientation started yesterday.  After I explained what happened, they checked with some guy if one more person could join. After approximately 5 min, they let me in right away. The only difference is that instead of a printed badge with your name, you will receive a handwritten one. Other than that, everything else will be normal. \n\nIt is a bit risky but could work out as a last measure. After all, July 6th is soon anyway, so I hope you can hop on that one.",

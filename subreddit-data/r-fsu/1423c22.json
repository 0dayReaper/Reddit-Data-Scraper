    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m an incoming graduate student looking for a 1x1 or studio. However, after doing some research on student housing in Tallahassee, it seems to be a living nightmare. At this point, my #1 priority is safety. As a woman who\u2019s gonna be living alone, I want to make sure where I live is somewhat safe. Does anyone have any recommendations? \nI have been looking a the midtown area- Londontown Apartments, Midtown at Meridian, Georgetown Apartments. \n\nI have also looked at STU properties- but after research, I\u2019ve heard to stay far away from anything this property management offers. (Is this true?) I\u2019ve also been looking at Jackson Properties- which I\u2019ve heard is better. \n\nBasically from what I\u2019ve gathered, the closer you live by Campus, the more likely it is you are to be ripped off, crime, etc (but i could be wrong!) I\u2019m coming from UF, where it is quite the opposite. So I really need help. \n\nAny insight, recommendations, etc is appreciated !",

            "comment": "If someone is saying \"actually, there is very, very little random violent crime\" somewhere, then you know there is actually a lot of violent crime. Tallahassee is no exception. It is a densely populated area with rampant problems of homelessness and drug abuse. You are more than valid in believing what you believe, and you need to stay safe.\n\nTallahassee is a very good example of a city with concentric zones. The middle of the circle (which is literally a circle enclosed within Capital Circle Road) is the inner city. NOT a good area. Generally, the further out you go, the safer and more rural you are. But what I've noticed from living there for a cumulative 6 years, the further out you go, the more expensive it gets. South of Gaines Street near FAMU is a no-go as well. \n\nHousing in tallahassee is *horrible*.",

Management are responsive but pretty hands-off otherwise, the neighbors are quiet and the location is great for work but also not too close to campus. I feel safe here and we've never had any big issues.",

Don't date someone who is dating someone else who is bigger/meaner than you are. Booze and guns do not mix. If you see these two together at a party, leave immediately. \n\nI know quite a few grad students who live in the townhomes off of High Road. They're not fancy, but are on bus routes/close to campus but not too full of loud undergrads.",

Before I moved here I read a lot that made me feel like it wasn\u2019t, but I walk everywhere (live near campus) and always feel safe. My sister also lives near campus, uses public transportation, and says she feels safe even walking at night, though of course that is personal preference. Totally fine in daylight.",

            "comment": "I just signed a month ago at Heritage Grove. The great thing there is that it is technically FSU campus so the only people who can live there are FSU students. Also it is patrolled by FSUPD and they have the FSU bluelights around the site. They just did a full renovation as well so the units are basically brand new. When I signed the rate was 849 and that included all utilities and internet. I guess it used to be for frats but they transitioned to just FSU students for their apartments and they were all kicked out. They have a referral special going on so if you check it out and sign let them know Steve E. told you about it and I get a gift card.\n\nI would def avoid Stu, Jackson properties is okay but fairly old places.",

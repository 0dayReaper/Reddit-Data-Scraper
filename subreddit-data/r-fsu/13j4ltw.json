I suppose I live in a more moderate state, but DEI initiatives aren't really social justice more than supporting students who have (statistically trackable) worse success rates in college due to a lot of things.\n\nIt's not Universities that are at the forefront of the \"culture wars,\" it's the students who attend them and develop their own beliefs. There's a lot in this world I agree with and don't agree with, but I don't think it's the place of government to tell people what they can and cannot think is right.",

I fully acknowledge that the rankings are flawed in many ways, but it's also clear that FSU's rise up those rankings has contributed to its ability to attract extremely bright and talented students from all over the country over the past several years that wouldn't have considered FSU when it was ranked in the 40s or 50s of publics. \n\nAnd the single largest component of those rankings are derived from the reputational survey of other university presidents and admissions officers. So all it takes is those survey takers, the vast majority of whom I'm sure the governor would characterize as \"woke libs,\" to question whether these laws might hinder FSU's ability to provide a comprehensive education, and perhaps lower their prestige score by a point or two. If enough of them have those concerns, we could see all of the hard work to rise in the rankings over the past decade-plus undone rather quickly. Which would frankly be a complete, and completely unnecessary, travesty.",

(For example the abortion ban, the book bans in schools, etc). \n\nFinally he\u2019s worked to make it easier to buy/carry guns in their state, as well as strengthened stand your ground.

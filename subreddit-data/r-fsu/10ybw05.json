    "postText": "Hey everyone! I posted about a week ago about starting an aviation club, we are about to send in the RSO application, hopefully sometime early next week, as soon as we can get 4 people to do the hazing prevention module on canvas. We are looking to have a GBD sometime in the next two weeks. In the meantime, we made a discord!   \n\n\nAlso if anyone is interested in it, Air Power history is putting on a flight show presidents day weekend for like 20 dollars, and you get to tour the inside of historic WW2 airplanes here at TLH! A good number of our officers will be there since we can't resist some fun aviation stuff!   \n\n\n[https://discord.gg/K4FDCgkMPk](https://discord.gg/K4FDCgkMPk)",

You can table at fairs and market Wednesday without being an RSO. My org is not registered yet and we\u2019ve been doing great. Just fyi. Good luck!",

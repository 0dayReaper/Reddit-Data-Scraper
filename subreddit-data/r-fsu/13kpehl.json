    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m transferring to FSU in the fall and have found the opportunity to live in the U club on Woodard. I heard excellent reviews on the complex, so I\u2019m not worried about having issues living there. However, since I couldn\u2019t experience on-campus housing/dorm life since I transferred from community college, it was important that the housing was within walking distance to campus so I don\u2019t have to feel like a commuter student. I preferred finding an apartment over a townhome since it\u2019s less isolated or has more social opportunities. But since I don't have that option now, I would like to know y\u2019alls social life experiences living in a townhome near campus. Thanks!",

Ended up becoming great friends with my neighbors and was able to get so close with all the surrounding units we could just walk in living rooms and hang out all the time. With anything it\u2019s what you make of it and you will\nHave no problem finding people in U club to befriend I\u2019m sure",

I also thought that might take away from the campus experience but they both assured me that they feel very connected on campus\u2026. If you notice, the housing surrounding campus is really just an extension of campus. It works well!",

    "postText": "I am currently a sophomore at a community college on track to earn my associates in Politcal science at the end of this spring semester. I originally applied as junior level transfer to fsu for Polotical Science however after being apart of economics classes this semester I have realized that I would rather earn my bachelors in that. I will have finished my community college equivalent macroeconomics and microeconomics at the end of the semester. Should i switch my major on the application right now even though the two main courses needed to transfer into economics are going to be \"in progress\"? Will this greatly diminish my results because they cannot see how I do in economics classes since they are still in progress? My gpa is a 3.9 so will they assume that I will earn at least a \"C\" grade in the course? Is there anyone here in the admissions office that can answer my question? Thankyou",

I would estimate a 1 in 20 chance compared to the near guarantee if you have all your prerequisites. I think it\u2019s because you wouldn\u2019t be considered as an AA transfer. What most people don\u2019t imply when they talk about transferring is it\u2019s an AA that includes the prerequisites for the college that you want to transfer into as well.",

            "comment": "Economics is a limited access major, which means they will likely put your admissions application on hold until they see that all required prereqs are done. Non-limited access majors can usually be approved with in progress grades, as long as you do eventually get the minimum needed.\n\nWhen in doubt, contact the college of the program you're trying to get into. Both of those are in social sciences, so you should find their admissions contact information on the same webpage",

Besides this, I meet every other prequisite and recommendation with flying colors (very very high GPA, etc.).\n\nI am currently on a year-long leave of absence so I wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to complete the prequisite this year anyway\u2026 can I change my major to business later?",

The college of business is very inflexible with their milestone tracking so you\u2019d have one semester to finish the class before being locked out. If you were unable to get a spot in the class because it\u2019s full you\u2019d be kind of stuck.",

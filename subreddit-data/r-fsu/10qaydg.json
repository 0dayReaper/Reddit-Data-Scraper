    "postText": "I have a quick question regarding parking for non-students. I graduated in April \u201822 but still come to campus to run and walk around. I know weekends it\u2019s open to whoever, but on weekdays at what point is it ok for a non-student to park in lots/garages? \n\nWithout getting ticketed or towed of course. I\u2019ve heard lots of conflicting answers before",

The parking website mentions purchasing a visitor pass for the semester so it may not be treated the same? [https://transportation.fsu.edu/visitors](https://transportation.fsu.edu/visitors). I don't know that for sure but just trying to read between the lines of their website.\n\nI'd reach out to them directly to ask if you can't get a straight answer from this thread. (850) 644.5278",

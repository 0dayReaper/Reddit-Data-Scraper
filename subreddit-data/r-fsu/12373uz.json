    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming honors freshman majoring in economics, I will have 30-40 AP credit hours by the end of high school if I do well on my exams this year. I know I need to take principles of micro/macroeconomics and have 50 something credits before I am formally admitted to my major, something that looks achievable by the time I\u2019m a junior. However, I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019ll be admitted earlier considering I will probably skip the principles courses and reach that number of credits by the end of my freshman year.\n\nI am required to take a related minor and currently feel most interested in comp sci, finance, and math. I think I\u2019ll have a hard time choosing and want to know if it would be reasonable for me to take two minors on top of honors requirements and other econ courses. I don\u2019t know if a dual degree is a good idea because it\u2019ll be even more work and I still think I\u2019ll have to pick a minor. I have a very rough goal of graduating, getting a job, eventually taking the GMAT, and trying to work towards going to grad school for my MBA at a place like UPenn. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t know if just trying to graduate early (even if it\u2019s less work and saves money) is a good idea.\n\nI might eventually drop the honors program because although I want better research opportunities, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s not worth all the hype and is just extra classes for some. Let me what you think!",

                            "comment": "I kinda disagree with the first comment, I would skip the principals classes if you feel like you know the material well from AP. You can definitely meet people in the upper level classes, as that\u2019s where I met most of my friends from the business school (I\u2019m an accounting major). \n\nThat being said, if you do skip some of the initial classes, expect to have to do more work than your peers. I am honors, graduating a year early, and had to do significantly more work than many of my friends both in and out of the business school. If you have good time management you will be fine, but it\u2019s important to prioritize school and finding friends, mental health etc, because it\u2019s easy to solely focus on one aspect of your life here and get distracted from the others at a place like fsu, like many students do. \n\nIt all depends what you want to make of the experience, how much work you want to put in, etc. This is just my opinion, and I think there are valid points to both sides",

            "comment": "Economics suggests students pick a \"related\" minor but doesn't require anything specific - you can pick any minor offered at FSU. It's really up to you. You only have to complete one minor, but you can do as many as you like. Just remember that minors don't show up anywhere after your graduate except on your resume, if you choose to list them. They aren't on your transcript, diploma, etc. so having multiple done is only a technical thing - dean's offices don't even look to see if more than one if done when they are reviewing you for graduation. \n\nReally you should just pick coursework within your electives (anything that isn't meeting a specific graduation requirements other than hours) that is interesting to you, furthers your academic/career goals, or otherwise that you see value in. Dual degrees, double majors, etc. are all options, but that's also your choice. Think about how soon you might want to graduate and what ultimately serves your long-term goals best.\n\nRe: comment about taking classes to meet people vs. you having credit for them through AP - you'll be told not to retake those courses because it actually causes you to lose credit if you do that since you don't earn anything extra by retaking courses.",

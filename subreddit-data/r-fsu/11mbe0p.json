            "comment": "I browsed through your profile and an assuming it\u2019s for a PhD in chemistry, which means if you came to one of the visitations you had lunch with me (one of the current grad students). I can\u2019t speak on behalf of UF, but I\u2019m graduating this semester with my PhD and I felt like I made the right choice with grad school. Don\u2019t concern yourself with chem rankings, I got into \u201chigher\u201d ranked schools and came here because it was a better fit for me. The facilities here are some of the best, and that\u2019s not including the mag lab or high performance materials institute. You\u2019ll be fine on the stipend they give here assuming you don\u2019t have a $400 car payment or pick an overly expensive apartment. Really what it\u2019s going to boil down to is the type of research you want to do. Identify the PI\u2019s you\u2019d want to work for, and make sure you confirm if they are taking people in the fall. If you\u2019re unsure what you want to do, the great thing about FSU is the rotation system for the new grad students where you can check out a bunch of labs and find the right fit for you, because it does exist here. Feel free to ask me any specific questions about the program.",

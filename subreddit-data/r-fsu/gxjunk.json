People weren\u2019t happy about this though and there was still an uproar. They decided to hold 2 zoom calls on consecutive days where the community could express their opinions on the matter. There were many speakers, some defended his actions while some opposed. There was another vote of no confidence held, which this time passed.\n\n2nd Vote of no confidence\nhttps://twitter.com/fsusga/status/1269101335028346892?s=21\n\nI would give a link to the senate meeting recordings but I don\u2019t have them.",

I don't know who \"we\" refers to, but *I* certainly am not pushing tolerance of bigotry.\n4. Bigots should not feel welcome. Whether they have found a way to use their religion to rationalize their bigotry is irrelevant. You are implying that Catholics in general are being condemned, when in fact a particular Catholic with beliefs that are arguably anti-Christian (e.g. he advocates violence against abortion providers) is being condemned.",

The student senate is bound by state law, meaning that they abide by the 1st amendment which includes freedom of religion and the right to express your beliefs.\n\n3. In absolutely no way was Denton directly expressing bigotry, he was only speaking in accordance to his own religious beliefs. Nor was he directly telling his fellow students and senate members to not support those organizations.\n\nYou are entitled to what you believe in regards to this situation, and I will respect it as such.

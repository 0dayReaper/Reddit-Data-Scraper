Ik that I can\u2019t get into the leach if I\u2019m not a student, but will it still allow me to go to events at the aslc or club down under, etc. specifically there is international coffee hour going on and I went to almost every one, but since I\u2019m no longer a student would I be denied access or will my card still work?",

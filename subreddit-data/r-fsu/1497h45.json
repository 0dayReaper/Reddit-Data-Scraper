    "postText": "For context I am planning on graduating next spring (2024) with my BA in Marketing. I am signed up to take a course that will satisfy my SIP requirement in summer B. Do I also need a FE credit? Or is it one or the other. My advisor has never mentioned a FE credit before and I am just now seeing a mass email about how I can use summer experiences as a FE credit and this is the first time I\u2019ve heard of it.",

You can register your car's information there, and it's like a virtual \"permit.\" So long as you always park nose-in no matter which lot or garage you park in, and your license plate is showing, you'll be recognized by the system as a valid FSU student permit!\n\nI think all garages' top floor is available for overnight, and even more floors if you park in Traditions or Pensacola. Be careful not to park on the commuter-only floors overnight (after 10pm on weekdays) or they'll give you a $30 ticket. There's more information about the hours here: [https://transportation.fsu.edu/parking-permits](https://transportation.fsu.edu/parking-permits)",

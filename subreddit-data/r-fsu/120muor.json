    "postText": "I am committed to FSU (economics, honors program) but due to my family\u2019s ridiculously high EFC, we got 0 aid and have to pay full cost out-of-state, a barely affordable ~$40k. I applied to some scholarships through FS4U and emailed the economics department to ask about merit scholarships, but they said they only have them for upperclassmen. If anyone knows about other merit scholarships I can apply to, please let me know!",

It\u2019s understandable because $40k is difficult to afford as it is, they probably are outright unable to do $50k+ at once. Besides, I think that while I\u2019ll make friends on the study abroad program, I will be disconnected from the rest of campus when I come back and behind the flow of things. I could be wrong, but that\u2019s just how I see it.",

It\u2019s possible to get in state tuition if you establish residency in Florida but you would like need to not be a dependent of your parents. I got a small scholarship based on merit but it was only like $2k/year eventually I got the OOS tuition waiver which is based on merit. Unfortunately sounds like you didn\u2019t get it. Otherwise there isn\u2019t much through FSU you\u2019d have to go thru a 3rd party.",

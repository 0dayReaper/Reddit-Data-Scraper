    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm currently at a Florida community college and will graduate this spring (next month) with my AA. I am hoping to transfer to FSU as a public health major. From my understanding there are no prereqs, you just have to meet the university standards. Which I believe I do: 3.1 GPA, passed both college-level English comp and mathematics, etc. My nerves are eating me alive and I was hoping someone here could offer me some info about getting accepted. Maybe about your own experience...\n\nI'm sure this sub has a lot of similar posts that appear frequently so I'm sorry if this seems repetitive, but I appreciate any and all help. Thank you.",

Breathe \u263a\ufe0f\n\nHave you applied yet? If not, go ahead and get your app in. The earlier you apply, the earlier they can get you a conditional decision, even if you still have some courses in progress this semester.",

I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I\u2019m ecstatic about going to FSU. \nTake some time to step back and think about your decision \u2014 not to reconsider, just to recognize that this is a fantastic opportunity and that you\u2019ve likely worked insanely hard to get here. \nI\u2019m not from the area, so it helped me to do a lot of research on the area/FSU community that I\u2019m joining. \nLet yourself be nervous, but also let yourself be excited!! This is amazing, and you need to enjoy this time as you get ready to join Florida State!!",

    "postText": "I transferred in last fall as an out of state student and I didn't get any financial aid help from FSU and paid the full ~25k out of pocket. I thought I would get some kind of grant for this year and figured I just applied late last year as a transfer for aid and this was why I got none.\n\nDoes FSU give grants? I have a pretty big estimated need number on the portal but I'm getting absolutely nothing and I don't have another 25k to be paying for this school year.",

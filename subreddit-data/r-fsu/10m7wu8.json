I love rats and would hate for anything to happen to them.\n\nEdit: okay i understand they are killed now. what would the chances be of getting my hands on one of the rats I work with when we are done? I feel it is very unlikely but a girl can dream... My first pet rat I \"saved\" (he was a feeder rat) was such a sweetheart.",

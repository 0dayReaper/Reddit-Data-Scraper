    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm currently taking my third semester of computer science at George Washington (in DC), and I'm considering applying to transfer to Bowdoin to get out of the city, and more onto a traditional college campus. I was wondering:\n\n1. How is the CS department at Bowdoin? Would love to hear thoughts on professors, classes, requirements, etc.\n2. How active is the sports community? I love playing pick up basketball, running, volleyball, and am wondering what the team sports atmosphere is like at Bowdoin.\n\nThank you for any and all responses :)",

I liked all the professors and there's a pretty good breadth of courses. That said, they were pretty understaffed and the classes were large / it may be difficult to get into them. Not sure if this has improved. Department is perhaps slightly on the easy side compared to other non-liberal arts schools (just from my personal experience, others may feel different) which could be a positive or negative depending on how you feel about it.\n\n2) sports are quite popular. I think something like 2/3 of students are involved in sports in some capacity whether that be the teams, club sports, etc. You'll probably be able to find pickup games for a variety of sports when the weather's nice.\n\nYou probably know this already but it's very difficult to transfer into Bowdoin, so good luck and don't get your hopes too high",

            "comment": "Hey! I'm currently studying CS at Bowdoin, and I can tell you that I really appreciate the apartment here. The major isn't light on requirements by any means but hopefully, you'd be able to transfer a good amount of credits over. \n\n1. Class sizes for the CS department are generally in the 15-30 range, leaning towards \\~30. Our department is, as /u/JackofAllSuedes said, still understaffed (although we are in the process of trying to hire some new professors) and so it can be hard to get into classes at times (we have a lottery system). In any case, if you're a CS major, you don't have to worry too much as the professors/staff will work with you to make sure you're able to graduate on time. What I really enjoy about the CS department here is how personal you can be with the professors, in my experience, all of them are really kind and eager to help you learn. And office hours is a great resource to both master the material you learn in class and get to hear about their lives. Outside of that, there are ample opportunities for you to do research with them too if that sounds like something you'd like.  \n\n2. The sports community is definitely alive and active for you if that's something you're interested in. Although, given Bowdoin's much smaller student population you'll probably find yourself seeing a similar group of people time and time again. I have quite a few people who regularly go to pick-up basketball and soccer and they all seem to really enjoy their time.\n\nbut yeah! hope that helps. Best of luck with the transfer process if you end up deciding that's something you'd like to pursue",

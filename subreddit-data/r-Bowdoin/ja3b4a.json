If you're also into the outdoors you'll love it, although students who are not really enjoy it as well.\n\nIf you're a staunch conservative, looking for a big party scene, looking for a vibrant downtown area to go out to, or completely disinterested in larger social causes/the Common Good, you'll probably dislike Bowdoin.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I've posted here before, but it's time to start submitting my applications and I'm super nervous. I wanted to reach out and talk to students and potential applicants. \n\nBowdoin is one of my top choices, but I'm not applying ED because I want to keep my options open for financial aid and expense reasons. I'm also not submitting my SAT and ACT scores. \n\nI'm Vice President and Stage Manager (and was a technician for 3 years prior) for my school's Theatre Troupe, I'm treasurer of NAHS and Game Theory Club and I'm a member of NHS, Senior Council, Student Council and Art Club. \n\nI volunteer at the local aquarium, cat shelter, and also have a small jewelry business. \n\nBeyond that, I also have an AP Scholar Award and was accepted into the National Hispanic Recognition Program. \n\nI really would appreciate any insight/responses from people also submitting their apps, people who have gotten accepted, or current students. Any help or opinions whatsoever are great!",

I applied through Questbridge so I might have had a different experience, but I also didn\u2019t submit any test scores and they are overall very NOT considered even for students that did submit them. Through the short snippet of your accomplishments, WHICH ARE PHENOMENAL, I 100% am of the belief that you are a really good applicant. The admissions team primary looks at interdisciplinary work, and with any college, that minority card does wonders as well. Of course admission acceptance is dependent on a lot of other factors as well, and I\u2019m sorry I cannot provide a better response, but I\u2019m so excited to hear your interest in Bowdoin. If you have any questions about campus or the administration as your acceptance letters come in and you\u2019re getting ready for that final decision, I welcome you to send me a pm.\nAlso I just want to say that ik it\u2019s a stressful time, but you\u2019re almost done with HS, please take care of yourself, wishing you the best!!",

I think I'm just a little bit stressed and nervous because the whole application process is almost over (and then scholarships will kick up aahhhh). I'm really thankful for your support and am glad to hear some of your viewpoints! Everyone I've come into contact w/ in affiliation to Bowdoin has been so kind :)\nI'm also pretty worried my personal essays aren't that great, but all I can do now is try my best and hope I'll end up where I am supposed to be. Once again thank you for commenting and I'll hopefully come back with good news!",

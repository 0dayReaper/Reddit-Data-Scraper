    "postText": "Hello! I'm a rising senior and applying to Bowdoin in the fall, it's definitely one of my top choices. I play the cello and am planning on sending in a supplemental recording of Bach/concerto and maybe a Popper etude. Has anyone heard on whether admissions takes the recording into serious consideration? Cello has been one of my primary focuses throughout high school and I know I want to pursue it in college, possibly as a major. Also, could a recording compensate for some of the weaker parts of my application? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi! I wasn\u2019t a music major but I did take a lot of classes in the music department and I know some of the faculty fairly well. As I understand it, admissions sends all the music supplements to the department, and they do take the professors\u2019 comments into account when making decisions. From what I\u2019ve been told, it mostly can\u2019t hurt to submit one, since a standout supplement can have a positive impact on your application and a just-ok one won\u2019t hurt your chances any. So I\u2019d say submit! Hope that helps and I\u2019m happy to answer any other questions you might have.",

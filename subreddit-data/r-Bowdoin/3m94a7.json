Can you give any insight on what type of questions they will ask and what answers they want to hear?\n\nThanks.  ",

            "comment": "I wouldn't worry about it too much, its really not too much different from any other school. They're just trying to get a feel for who you are and if you would fit in here. They'll probably ask about your extracurriculars in HS - be prepared to expand upon them. i.e.) why you're passionate about them. Maybe talk about in what capacity you'd like to continue them at Bowdoin.\n\n\nAnd just keep in mind that I didn't have a great interview and still got in, so it's just a part of your application. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I do alumni interviews off campus but they are the same.\n\nBasically what we like to see is that you are passionate about things. Everyone does extracurriculars so you are going to want to point out what makes you stand out. Anything with a leadership role or times when you went above and beyond the normal extracurricular participation.\n\nThe other thing you will want to tell the interviewer is *why* you want to go to Bowdoin. It helps if you have *specific* reasons. Saying that you like Bowdoin because it is ranked well is fine. However, it is far better to give specific reasons why you like Bowdoin in particular. What sets it apart in your mind from similar schools? Don't trash the other schools but be able to say why you want to go to Bowdoin over other small liberal arts schools.\n\nAnother thing that you should do is have a few questions. A few good questions go a long way toward showing that you are interested in Bowdoin.\n\nDon't sweat it. Just be confident and conversational, like you are talking with a friend or family member.",

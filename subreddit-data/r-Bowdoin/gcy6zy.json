What do you like/dislike about the college? Also (admitted students) if you don\u2019t mind, could you share your GPA/test score and extracurriculars? I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m even competitive lol",

            "comment": "Hi, current junior here. I'm a physics major but I've taken a couple of history classes, no politics (Bowdoin calls it government idk why). I really enjoyed my history classes though. I like Bowdoin, but I think my opinions might be more helpful to you if you had specific things you were interested in hearing about? I'd say for admissions I looked good on paper but didn't have tons of extracurriculars. If you've got any questions just ask.\n\nEDIT: here's a page with basic info on admissions for 2023: https://www.bowdoin.edu/admissions/at-a-glance/class-of-2023.html",

Most people seem to take interest in what they're studying and try to do their best, but it doesn't get competitive or overwhelmingly nose-in-book (people take breaks and know when to call it quits and go outside). My least favorite might be the social/party scene. There are no fraternities or sororities which I think is a good thing, but there aren't many campus-wide social events once you're done with freshman or sophomore year. If you're an outgoing person that might not be a problem, but as an introvert with not a lot of free time (I'm on a small but time consuming sports team) it's been hard to meet people.\n\n  \n\n\nI love the weather in Maine. It's not deathly cold like some people say, but my hair does freeze on the way to class in February. Winter lasts a long time, but I'm from the PNW so I'm used to the long dark rainy seasons. If you are super attached to having sunshine while you study it could be problematic, but I don't think it's all that bad.",

I'm hoping to study some combination of physics, math, and computer science (but I LOVE history!). I like the idea of Bowdoin a lot on paper, but I'm worried about being a STEM major at a smaller college that isn't focused only on STEM. I've been involved with physics research at a large research university (I live near one) and I'm worried that I won't get the same resources for research at Bowdoin.  Is there anything that you think Bowdoin doesn't have that a large research university would? \n\nA few more questions, how is the gender diversity in STEM classes? How many people play club sports? How popular is study abroad? Is it hard to study abroad while being a STEM major?",

                            "comment": "Hi sofieMH, it's awesome you're interested, and I'll try to answer your questions as best I can. As it happens, I take a lot of math and history as well as physics at Bowdoin. It's true that research is way different at a big university. I'd say that research opportunities are available in the physics department, in part because not all the physics majors are interested in research. That said, the research opportunities are limited by what the professors are interested in and the facilities we have (you can find the professors' research on their faculty pages). I know the chem/bio departments send samples to labs at MIT and Harvard sometimes, so it's possible you could do physics research with their equipment, but don't quote me on it. Despite the smaller range of studies, I'd say that physics research at Bowdoin is pretty high level, and certainly matches the quality of research at a big university.\n\nThe gender diversity has been pretty good in my experience. My class of physics majors is ~50% women, but I think there are more men the other grades. My math classes have been male majority, but not by much. I took intro comp-sci and chem, both of those were &gt;50% women.\n\nClub sports are somewhat popular, with frisbee, skiing, and crew being the biggest ones I know of. What would you be interested in playing?\n\nStudy abroad is very popular, I think ~half of people study abroad junior year. It's not that hard to do as a STEM major, though for requirement heavy majors like biochem/neuro or a pre-med focus it can be limiting in which programs you can choose. For others like physics and math, or regular bio or chem, it's pretty easy.\n\nIf you've got any more questions, ask away.",

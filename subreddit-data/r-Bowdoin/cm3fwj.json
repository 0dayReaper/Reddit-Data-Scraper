    "postText": " As a current student at Bowdoin, I feel like there are some spots that everybody appreciates or goes to(e.g., The Pub, Frosty\u2019s, H&amp;L, Gelato Fiasco, etc.). However, I know there are definitely many other places around campus that are under appreciated. So I wanted to ask some Polar Bears, both past and present, what do y\u2019all think are some underrated spots on/around the Bowdoin campus?",

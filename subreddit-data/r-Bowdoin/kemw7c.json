So, I\u2019ll be requesting about 60k yearly.\n\nDo you know any internationals with this much financial aid?\n\napplying ED2, will I have a chance to recieve this kind of aid?\n\nMy stats are fine for bowdoin I believe:\nSAT: 1490\nGPA: 91/100\nI also do the IB program. My predicted is 41/45.",

No acceptances at all.\nI went to the Netherlands, dropped out at the end of the year. Now I am back at home, changed my mind about what I\u2019m gonna study and do in life and gonna apply to European unis.\nDo not go to the US, its a horrible country with nothing. Especially if you are applying with financial aid. Europe is much better than that shithole",

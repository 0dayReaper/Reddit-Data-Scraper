    "postText": "I was matched to Bowdoin through QuestBridge in December and I\u2019m super excited to attend next year!! I have never been to Brunswick (let alone anywhere on the east coast), so I have a few questions about what the vibe is like over there:\n\n- how would you describe the typical student?\n- is there a lot of stress culture?\n- is there a party scene?\n- what\u2019s the diversity like and how are low income first gen students treated?",

            "comment": "Howdy! I'm a current junior. Also happen to be a low-income first-gen Black woman. I'm double majoring in Philosophy and German with a minor in Cinema Studies. \n\n1) The typical Bowdoin student is an upper class white jock who majors in Gov or Econ and wants to go into business or finance. They are most likely from \"just outside of Boston\". \n\n2) Yes and no. Bowdoin somehow manages to be both competitive and not at the same time. It really depends on what major you're in and who you hang out with. I will say that I, personally, am stressed literally all of the time. Bowdoin's COVID response has not helped with this. Lmk if you need me to elaborate. \n\n3) There was a party scene before the pandemic hit but it was pretty nasty. Most of the action happened at mixers for the sports teams, so if you weren't an athlete your social options became more limited. Every weekend the social houses would host parties open to the whole campus, but those were crowded and grimy and probably only your scene if you wanted to listen to Mr. Brightside like 8 times straight. A couple of times during the semester the Black and Latino student unions would throw parties that were actually lit and had good music. They would invite kids from other campuses to come as well. I loved those parties. They often got shut down by security or the police though. Nowadays thing are more lowkey. Upperclassmen will host like a handful of people in their apartment and we'll drink and play games and listen to music (quietly) so as not to get busted by security. That's pretty much all that happened this semester. EDIT: I should mention that before COVID there were yearly events everyone looked forward to. Ivies, the Toga Party, the Cold War party. Not happening currently because of the pandemic. \n\n4) Bowdoin is not a diverse school. Please do not let anyone tell you otherwise. [Here is a post I made in r/blackladies about my freshman year](https://old.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/an7aff/for_those_of_yall_who_graduated_from_pwis_how_did/). That is just the tip of the iceberg of some of the crap I have experienced. Recently Bowdoin has started trying to reach out to and accommodate low-income POC students. One of these initiatives is [THRIVE](https://www.bowdoin.edu/thrive/). I'm a mentor in the program. It has its own benefits and negatives. I can get more into that if you want. The main thing about Bowdoin's so-called diversity--or lack thereof--is isolation. Depending on where you are from, what you study, and the groups you are apart of you can end up feeling extremely isolated. This past semester I was the only Black person in all 3 of the classes I took. Granted, philosophy and German are not the most diverse subjects, but I still found this to be absurd. If you end up studying in a majority white discipline, prepare to be the only face of color. This isn't a problem in say the Africana or Art departments. My freshman year I was the only black person on my floor. If you go into town, everyone is going to be white. It's Maine. The counter to this point is that you can choose to associate with people like yourself. Join THRIVE and go to their events. Sign up for their mentorship program so you have an upperclassman to look out for you on campus. Join the BSU, ASA, LASO, etc. If you see other POC link up. \n\n5) I come from a single parent household. I am only at Bowdoin because of the enormous aide package I receive. I also have to work 20 hours per week (the max set by the Dean's office) in order to pay my bills and send money home. People at Bowdoin have ridiculous amounts of money. Some kid I lived with my first semester flew himself to the private airport next to the school on his dad's private jet. Half of the kids who go here are paying for tuition, r&amp;b out of pocket. There are times I wanted to go out with my friends/floormates/classmates but they were doing something I couldn't afford. Not a lot of people work as many hours as me and my professors are constantly telling me to quit one of my jobs or work less or do things that just aren't financially feasible for me. I had to use the emergency fund to afford winter gear and dental care. I've had to stay on campus over breaks because we couldn't afford plane tickets home. But, I will say there are a lot more middle class and low income people on campus than people of color. So it's easy to find those groups and hang out with them. The school has a lot of programs to help these demographics out, but sometimes that translates into a feeling of being singled out??\n\nI hope I answered your questions. Hit me up if you want me to elaborate on any of my points or if you just want to know somebody before you get to campus :D",

            "comment": "Heyyo! Current soph and I can try and offer some input on it.\n\n\\- Typical student would definitely be white \"upper middle class\" (by that I mean like wealthy to most people) who is involved with some sort of sports team. Typical students stick to their \"group\" pretty tightly\n\n\\- Stress culture sort of depends on your major/what work you do. Ik there can be stress culture in STEM fields but I take a really varied courseload and I don't feel too stressed atm.\n\n\\- Party scene definitely blows tbh, it'll be fun freshman year with college house parties but people come in with HUGELY different party experiences. Lots of kids coming in who have no experience w parties before. But defi like pretty dull (second the Mr. Brightside comment) but events like BSU parties r usually the best. Also about 36% of campus is varsity athletes and there is almost always team mixers going on that basically take away over 1/3 of students from normal parties any given weekend (you'll esp feel this your freshman year, as the young athletes want to connect more with their teams), which sucks. \n\n\\- Diversity is sort of weird here. With how small the school is diversity ain't really manifest itself that well in campus community and the isolation part mentioned by bobonafick is real for them. A vast majority of the people who go to Bowdoin come from the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast, so if you ain't from there the isolation will probs hit you harder. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd honestly suggest trying to join some club team when you get here. Hands down best way to meet people if you aren't a varsity athlete, and so much of Bowdoin socially revolves around athlete/non-athlete divide",

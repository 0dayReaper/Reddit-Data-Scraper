My biggest issue with Midd is the jock culture. There's a very strong divide between \"Athletes\" and \"Non-Athlete Regular People\". This is not unique to Midd (see: Williams, Amherst, etc.), but it's way less of an issue at Bowdoin. I am not an athlete and I have yet to feel less special or less important because of it. Non-athletes and athletes are frequently and easily friends, there's really no problem with it at all. The administration really emphasizes that we're students first, athletes second.\n\nAlso, we have better food and better facilities. And we're better integrated with Brunswick (Middlebury town hates the college). And the people are really fucking nice here.\n\n/rant\n  \nApply to Bowdoin wheeeee ",

I dont play any varsity sports but I'm generally a pretty healthy person. Worried that at Midd if I wasn't on a team my social options would be limited. At Bowdoin, everyone seemed happier and were definetley friendlier. Wish I was there now!\n\nThanks again a ton for the advice\n\nEDIT: Plus I love the ocean and the outdoors haha",

Looking back on it, it was almost entirely due to personal stuff going on at the time, slightly influenced by the fact that I didn't have the best relationship with my roommates.

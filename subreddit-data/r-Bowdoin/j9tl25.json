    "postText": "Hi! I hope you guys are seriously doing fine, seeing how limited learning has been going for everyone, and that the autumn view is at least giving some sanity. Anyways, I just found out (or at least properly looked into) Bowdoin today, and this school is literally everything I wished for, and I really realized what people meant by dream school lol. \n\nEnough gushing, but I do have some questions about a major I was interested in, which is Environmental Studies. If I heard correctly, people who declared that major can also go into other studies. Is there anyone in Env Studies? How is it like for Bowdoin/being in Brunswick? I'm kind of an outdoorsy person and casually being able to ID things and cultivate ornamental plants, and I have some what of an interest towards wild life. I like hands-on and in the field type of work (though that seems difficult for today's environment :( ) Would the Env Studies course be towards that sort of interest, or should I go towards Biology?\n\nAlso I don't know if anyone has a clear answer for this, but has anyone studied abroad? How was it like?  \nWhat's the coursework like? I've heard there's a lot of reading, so I'm assuming it's similar to being in an AP History class haha.  \nHow diverse is the demographic, both racially and academically? I'm an Asian/Pacific Islander and my grades are probably above-average, but nothing spectacular or might even be below the average for this school &lt;:U\n\nSorry if this is a lot of questions, but I hope someone out there enjoys answering them. Thanks guys!",

Studies, I'm not an insider but here is what I do know: it's a pretty popular program (1 of the top 5?? def top 10) majors, and most people who I know do ES combine it with another major. There is also a off campus \"costal studies center\"--here's more info on it: [https://www.bowdoin.edu/coastal-studies-center/](https://www.bowdoin.edu/coastal-studies-center/). \n\nAbout Brunswick, it gets cold... but it's a cozy, quaint little town. There's basically one major road (main street) where the restaurants and shops line, and there are tons of nature things to do around. between classes, friends, clubs, and going to Portland / Bos, there's always something to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor coursework, it's probably not gonna be too much different than other liberal arts colleges, i.e.,  readings/prep before classes, and assignments due every once in a while (of course depends on the class). the transition is rougher for some but if you've survived APs, you'll probably be fine in college, too.

And I definitely love small towns/rural areas since I make my own fun most of the time :P the cold is something I've experienced, but not live in 24/7 so I def have to get used to that haha! The summers there look like how it feels to be in an air-conditioned room here (I'm from Guam, so it's around 80F all-year), so I think it's generally on the colder side for me.",

The school has also recently made some really significant investments into facilities for the field and I think they're really trying to build one of the top programs in America right now. Have you looked into the Coastal Studies Center at all? I think you'll really like it.\n\nBrunswick isn't the largest town, but it's bigger than you think. The adjacent town Lewiston is basically part of it which puts the realistic population at about 50,000. There isn't significant nightlife or anything but you can get almost anything you want. 30 minutes drive gets you to Portland (or a 3 dollar bus), 2.5 gets you to Boston, and there are both buses and trains so you are way better connected than a comparable school like Williams which is actually in the middle of nowhere. \n\n&gt;has anyone studied abroad? How was it like?\nWhat's the coursework like?\n\nTo be honest it's *way* early to be worrying about this, but almost everyone does it. EOS people have their own programs in incredibly cool places like New Zealand if that's the sort of thing that interests you. A friend of mine went to Siberia as she was interested in Arctic conservation. Possibilities are pretty endless. \n\nBest of luck on your journey! Bowdoin certainly sounds like an incredible fit for what you're asking for.",

            "comment": "The thing about the Environmental Studies major is that its a coordinate major, meaning students have to do it alongside another major with connected focus, typically history/gov or eos/chem/bio. This is because the environmental studies courses aren't focused enough for their own major, but cover a broad range of topics. So people more interested in the science can get into that while getting humanities context, or those interested in the policy side can do that while also learning the underlying science, etc. While I'm not an environmental studies major myself, I think the option to tailor your curriculum is great and there are good classes in all the paths. I think the ENVS courses are generally more humanities-oriented, but there is a plant biology course, and the EOS (Earth and Oceanographic Studies) courses are mostly hard sciences with a focus on climate and hands-on learning if that interests you.\n\nI came from a big-ish city to Bowdoin, so Brunswick is definitely a size smaller. That said, I don't really miss much. A couple more restaurant options or a 24/7 diner would be cool, but unless you're looking for nightclubs the town has lots to offer. There's also a fair amount going on on campus, so I don't go into town all that much anyways. It gets cold in the winter but rarely below 0F, and campus is small so you can't get hypothermia on the way to class without seriously trying for it.\n\nI didn't study abroad, but my friends who did liked it and its easy to do. I can't speak for the ENVS courses, and my high school didn't offer AP, but there can be a lot of reading - it depends on the professor. I would say its never overwhelming, but rarely super short.\n\nAs for diversity, Bowdoin is a pretty white and wealthy school. The student body is diverse compared to a lot of liberal arts colleges but it's still not representative of society at large. Academically idk how to describe it, but I'd guess most anyone can find classmates who share their academic experience/successes and difficulties.",

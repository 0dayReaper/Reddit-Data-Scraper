I haven't been here long enough to speak about the academics or anything, but I've definitely met some of my favorite people here already.",

As others have said, the best thing is the people, both professors and fellow students. You get to know professors well, in fact I dog sat for one when they were out of town a few times. As for the other students, they\u2019re (typically) exceptional people. \n\nPut as much or yourself into your time on campus as you can, it\u2019ll repay you ten fold.",

Yeah,  just angsty I guess.",

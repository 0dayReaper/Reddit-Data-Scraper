Sometimes the classes fill up, but you can talk to the professor and typically they\u2019ll let a few people in off the waitlist. I\u2019ve only heard of one class where multiple students couldn\u2019t get off the waitlist, and it was just because there wasn\u2019t any more space in the classroom. I never had any issues getting to a class at Bowdoin, majored in CS/math",

I worked as a software developer for a while making pretty good money, and now I\u2019m in grad school studying AI.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the two subjects, majoring in both sets you up really well. But I\u2018ve got several friends who only majored in one or the other and are pretty happy with their careers as well",

They did some dumb stuff to get around this like bringing in some professors from not-as-good schools to help teach a couple lower-level in demand courses, and it went very poorly. That said, for all I know they've adjusted by now - and looking at the website, it looks like they've hired 2-3 new CS+DCSI professors since.",

I did 2 internships in software though and got a job programming investment algorithms at a hedge fund after graduating that pays very well. \n\nI would say in general CS graduates from Bowdoin are not going to quite as high paying jobs as top university CS/SWE students (who get the majority of the FAANG and similar jobs with insane comp), but from what I\u2019ve seen Bowdoin CS students tend to be competitive in the general software market and be well compensated because the software market compensates well. \n\nThat is to say, I\u2019d wager the average starting salary out of Bowdoin is highest for CS majors vs. other majors, but a step or step and a half down from the top CS earning schools. That\u2019s still quite quite good, and the best Bowdoin CS students will be in that top bracket, just the average is lower. \n\nHope that makes sense.",

I guess I'm okay with being on the lower end of the salary bracket, the lower end is still pretty decent. Do you know anyone who did Digital and Computational Studies? I know it's a relatively new major so you might not so no worries. I was initially planning to do that major but worried about how it sounds to employers, so my next step is to double major in comp sci + digital and Computational Studies.",

A quick look at the requirements page makes it look like you can\u2019t actually major in DCS, you basically do it as a supplement to another major \u201cin coordinate\u201d, adding a computer driven approach to another field of study. Not sure it would make sense to do the DCS coordinate with CS but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to figure it out when you\u2019re there.",

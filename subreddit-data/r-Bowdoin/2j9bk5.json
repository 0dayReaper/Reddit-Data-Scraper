    "postText": "Hi, I'm a high school senior who's been obsessed with Bowdoin for about a year now, and the time has come for me to start my supplemental essays. \n\nBowdoin requires you to write about either intellectual engagement, the Common Good, or connection to place, and I don't have much of an idea what I would write about for any of those topics.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea of what admissions looks for in these essays, besides the obvious things? (Strong writing, personal growth, etc.) Any other suggestions?",

If you find yourself having a hard time writing, you may need to think of something else to write about. If you're not convinced, it will probably come through in what you write. That's very general advice I guess. Sorry. \n\nIt's weird because I think these are the same topics they gave you 6 years ago when I was applying. I have no idea what I wrote about.\n\nGood luck!",

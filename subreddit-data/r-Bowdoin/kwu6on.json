    "postText": "heyy I hope you all are well!!\n\nI am a incoming freshman to bowdoin. I had a couple question about what the computer science department is like, especially for Black or POC people and/or women. \n\nAre there any professors you highly recommended? Any that you would rather avoid? \nWhat is the culture like? Is it collaborative or cutthroat and competitive among students? \nHave you experienced biases in the classroom? \nWhat support systems are in place or offered by professors? \nI have barley any experience with coding and stuff, would I still be able to survive and thrive in the classroom? \nIs there a expectation to have prior knowledge? \nWhat was your fav class or professor? \n\nThank you!!",

            "comment": "Hey there, recent grad, Econ/Asian Studies/Education, Asian male here. Congrats on becoming a future Polar Bear! I can\u2019t speak to the CS department specifically, but I would say in general across the multiple departments I\u2019ve taken classes in, the environment is really collaborative. I\u2019ve met very few cutthroat people at Bowdoin. Also from my friends\u2019 experiences, I think you should be okay starting CS from scratch, although a little bit of preparation can help. Overall, I loved my Bowdoin experience, but I will say though: prepare for a really white campus. And I\u2019m not just talking about the snow lol. I\u2019m sure my experiences will differ from yours, but I strongly recommend finding your space to be genuinely you, while still finding the strength to put up with the caucasity of some of your peers. For me, ASA (Asian Students Alliance) was huge for me. I also ended up having way more BIPOC friends by the time I finished at Bowdoin. On the other hand, I would also say try to challenge yourself to get out of you comfort zone, too. I think at times I was personally so caught up on race relations at Bowdoin, I spent a lot of time feeling crappy about everything, granted it was still important for growing my identity. As you could imagine, 2016 particularly was very tense. It\u2019s really a balancing act at times. The biggest support systems I ended up having were my friends, ASA, and the Multicultural Coalition. Also Dean Khoa is awesome. He\u2019s a huge ally to BIPOC. Look out for him. Hope this helps! Feel free to PM me any other questions",

I will try to get somewhat comfortable with being the only Black person or POC in the room even though it\u2019s deeply unsettling for me. thank you again!!",

            "comment": "Junior cs major here. I wouldn't worry about the interactions w faculties and students. Everyone's nice and happy to help. The TAs are particularly helpful when it comes to intro courses like data structures and algorithms. \n\nWith that being said, Bowdoin is def not the best place for cs. The number of courses offered here is very limited, because there just aren't that many professors. Bowdoin's cs department is just not big enough to compete with universities out there. But I will say the whole liberal arts spiel is true. (you'll hear a lot about this once you get here) My interviewer for the internship happened to went to Amherst and we had a great conversation about how liberal arts education translates to technical positions. The conclusion being the soft skills are oftentimes more important than the technical ones. \n\nAs for me, I came in knowing abs nothing about coding, and I now have an internship lined up. Depends on what you wanna do with the cs degree; if you want a job, take data structures and algorithms, and spend tons of time outside of school on leetcode practicing coding interview questions; if you want to go into a graduate school, do well in classes and build up good relationships with the professors to hopefully get a chance to do research with them in the summer, which help building your resume too. I didn't figure out any of this until second semester of my sophomore year, so don't worry about thinking you have to have internships or fancy research opportunities the first year.",

I'm afraid I won't be able to get a job after undergrad with a B.A in comp sci from Bowdoin if I go. How did it turn out for you? Were you able to get a decent paying job after undergrad from Bowdoin? I might be double majoring in digital and Computational Studies + comp sci as well.",

            "comment": "hey, i'm a sophomore at the school\n\nlike what others said, pretty collaborative atmosphere permeates throughout, from general social life to academics too (I mean the school is only like 2k kids after all).\n\nalso, we're not just a lib arts school, but a small lib arts school too, so even the hard sciences here are diff than at, say a larger state school or engineering school.\n\nas for professors, i think they really only come into play for the upper level classes where stuff is more niche; there's very few sections of introCS / data structures (the class after intro) offered every sem. also for profs, much more helpful to reach out to actual students, whether it be anyone on the Res Life or welcome to bowdoin team--they're all happy to help. I'm sure u can email admissions and they'll hook u up with someone if you don't know anyone going in. that q&amp;a is much easier than reddit lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\non the social side, yeah it's white preppy vibe, but enough people to find your gang.\n\nsome cliqueness b/c it's the size of a large high school after all, and hangouts are usually dorm parties/small gettogethers, given the lack of \"frat\"/school wide parties",

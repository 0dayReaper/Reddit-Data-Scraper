It\u2019s great but in the process the houses just never meshed the same since people were so different and the allure of them isn\u2019t really there anymore because they\u2019re just...there, not really a central part of the social scene anymore. Administration really butchered that one",

            "comment": "When I was there (just graduated) it was somewhere in between -- they have reputations that influence how the people living there behave, there is some continuity with initiation and house alums hanging around, and different houses' locations and layouts loan themselves to different things (for example Reed is more isolated, Baxter and Ladd are centrally located and have big basements for parties, and Burn has no good space for big campus wide parties but that can help build a strong community within the house). It's hard to say how Covid will affect this though. The cultural continuity from year to year was already pretty shaky with only sophomores living there, and I think skipping this year might lead to kind of a reset -- with no sophomores on campus this year, the first years won't form expectations of each house like they normally do, so when campus fully reopens it will pretty much entirely depend on the space, location, and the group living in each one.",

    "postText": "Hello there!\n\nI'm a potential incoming freshman thinking about doing CS + enviro studies (or maybe physics w/ 3+2 engineering), and I have a few questions that I hope you all can answer!\n\nHow strong are the CS/STEM departments? Do they lean more on the practical or theoretical side in general? Is there a collaborative or competitive vibe?\n\nHow easy is it to get research positions with faculty? Is it typically reserved for upperclassmen or is it possible to get a position within freshman year? Do you find the research opportunities limiting? How strong is the alumni network during or after graduation? Did you find it helpful in getting summer internships or job offers?\n\nHow is campus culture? Is there a big athlete/non-athlete divide? How strong is the Asian community on campus? Do you find extracurricular choices to be limited?\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Hi, current junior here. I'll try to answer what I can, and feel free to ask more.\n\nI've heard mostly good things about CS, but I haven't taken CS classes and none of my friends are in the department. Physics (mostly theoretical) and environmental studies are both really great, I'm a physics major myself. Most academics at Bowdoin are really collaborative, but CS is the strictest on working together because they don't want people copying code.\n\nResearch positions are generally easy to get, with math/econ/chem/bio being the most common. I'd say freshman year is earlier than average, and summer after sophomore year is when the majority of people start, but plenty start earlier. I haven't done research, but I've heard its hard to pick your own topic until honors projects because there aren't as many things going on as at a big university, and all the professors have their own research going on. Can't really speak to the alumni bit cause I haven't gotten to that stuff yet.\n\nI think campus culture is overall pretty good. There isn't really an athletics divide, but there are a lot of athletes and they tend to be closest with other people on their teams (just because they spend so much time together). In academics or at parties those boundaries rarely show up, in my opinion. I don't have any experience with the Asian community, sorry. I think extracurriculars depend on what you're interested in. There are a lot of great clubs, but some things I would like aren't there (like a jazz big band).\n\nI didn't look at UMich for undergrad, but I really want to go there for grad school. I think it comes down to what you want out of the school, and which one excites you more, because they're both great schools.\n\nHope this helps!",

                    "comment": "Ah thank you so much for your detailed response! They're pretty helpful. I just have two more questions! What are your thoughts on how Bowdoin has dealt with covid-19 and online classes seeing as though there's a chance first semester might be online depending on how the virus is dealt with in the next few months? Also, do you know of anyone who has done one of the physics/engineering programs and how that turned out for them? (I'm guessing it's pretty rare though.)\n\nThanks again!",

                            "comment": "I'll try to be level on the covid-19 stuff, but it's still playing out and I haven't been impacted negatively by the college's decisions (beyond e-learning, which everyone everywhere is doing). I think closing campus was the right call, but it should have been done so students could move out easily. As it was, they announced mid-break that we all had 1 week to get all our stuff out of the dorms, and getting back to campus was tough for some folks. The administration also didn't initially consider students for whom going home was not a good idea (e.g. students from China, or with no good home to go to). That said, they came around pretty fast and are allowing more exceptions and I haven't heard many complaints since then. As far as I know, the college as kept all staff (even dining and housekeeping) on the payroll, which is good. I also think the universal pass/fail is the right call, so I'm happy they stuck with that over grade-optional. I'm not upset with my online classes so far, and while obviously not as good as in-classroom academics, my professors are doing the best they can and the school is providing support for that.\n\nI don't know anyone who's done the 3-2/4-1 programs, but I'm lightly considering the 4-2 grad program with Columbia. I think the 12-college one through Dartmouth is super cool, but I think a lot of physics majors here are either more into pure physics than engineering, or (like me) would rather spend more time with the friends at Bowdoin and take one more year of school after. I think it comes down to personal preference, and the faculty would definitely support you if you decided to go for one of those.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know a ton about the Stem side of things, but there are several Asian student groups on campus that are all pretty active. Several of my friend have worked with faculty over the summer doing research, and a few of them did so starting freshman year. It is less common, but I think that\u2019s because upperclassmen are more likely to have a closet relationship with professors so they ask about summer positions earlier. Professors are generally super open to having students work with the. \nIn terms of how they\u2019ve been reacting to covid19 I think they\u2019ve done a pretty good job given the circumstances. There were complaints about students not being able to get back to campus on a weeks notice, but I feel like the community really came together to help people pack and ship students stuff. Bowdoin paid for a box of essential items to be shipped to anyone who couldn\u2019t get back and packed student\u2019s rooms if they couldn\u2019t do it themselves. The universal pass fail I think was a good choice and they did get some push back on it, but it seems like the most equitable solution for students who may be going back to places that are more challenging to work in. Bowdoin is also providing students with WiFi if they need it at home and I feel they\u2019ve don\u2019t a good job working with students\u2019 individual needs. There was also a ton of student to student support which shows how tight knit our community is. Students organized helping people get packed, collecting donations for travel funds and offering housing for those who couldn\u2019t make it back home.",

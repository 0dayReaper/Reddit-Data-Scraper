That's my prospective major, as well as Russian. How's Russian, too?\n2. Does Bowdoin have a Quidditch Team? \n3. How accessible is summer grants/international study grants?\n4. How do you feel about life in Brunswick?\n5. Anyone studied in Washington? Or have done the Bowdoin Public Service program?\n6. Any tips for the application process?\n\nThanks! Any answer to any question is welcome.",

            "comment": "Hello, prospective polar bear!\n\n *  The government program is pretty good. I personally haven't taken any classes in it, but a couple of my friends really like the department. It's especially strong if you're interested in environmental issues. I'm not sure about Russian.\n *  Not that I know of, but you could start one.\n *  I've heard the summer grants are quite accessible. I know a bunch of people who got grants for really cool projects.\n *  I honestly don't feel a need to go into town very often, but overall I like it. The restaurants are great, and there's a couple good cafes for studying in if you're into that. Otherwise Brunswick is a pretty quiet town.\n *  Don't know anythingthing about these programs, sorry.\n *  Don't stress too much? I guess I'd say write a good personal essay. It's the best way to show yourself beyond lists and test scores in the application process.\n\nIf you've got further questions, feel free to ask.",

One of the best prestigious departments at the college. A bunch of the folks I went to school with who majored in gov ended up down at Princeton\u2019s foreign service program and are now either in governments or NGOs doing super cool stuff. I have less insight on the Russian department, aside from to say that one of my closest friends from school was a Russian lit major and he\u2019s fucking awesome. Ended up becoming an architect, but still, loved that Russian program. \n\n2. No clue. \n\n3. Not sure but I believe pretty accessible. \n\n4. Brunswick is a cool little town. Good restaurant/bar scene considering how small it is. The real benefit of Brunswick isn\u2019t really Brunswick itself though. It\u2019s being able to cruise down to Portland, or out to the coast, or up to Acadia. It\u2019s just a spectacular part of the country. \n\n5. I\u2019m not sure if the foreign service folks I mentioned did those programs you asked about, but I\u2019ve never know bowdoin to half ass stuff. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a rock solid program. \n\n6. Bust your ass and present yourself as well as you possibly can, obviously. It\u2019s a great school and community, one which I\u2019ll be forever grateful to be a part of.",

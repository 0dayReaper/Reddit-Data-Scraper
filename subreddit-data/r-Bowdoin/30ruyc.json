Get it touch with the tennis coach through their recruiting questionnaire on their website. If you are good enough to help the team that can help your chances.",

No sports, no musical talent, no... to me it's like no personality. Yet somehow I got in. My essays were banging, I can say that. So listen to /u/maineiac42, because he is absolutely right.\n\nAlso, I heard from the interviewer for the college that what they want is people who will find their niche at Bowdoin and have fun. I can contribute to their theater program, so I had that. Do activities that can transfer to the college well.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nI'm an international senior who wants to apply to Bowdoin. I know it's a bit late but does anyone have any tips for the supplementals? I'm not sure what they're looking for in the short answer question: How did you first learn about Bowdoin? (Limit 140 characters.)\n\nWe also have to choose a line from \"The Offer of The College\" and reflect on a line of the poem and state what it means to us in 250 words. I'm not sure how to tackle them so if anyone has any tips of examples it would be much appreciated :))",

I found it very helpful: [https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/bowdoin-college-2019-20-supplemental-essay-guide/](https://www.collegeessayadvisors.com/supplemental-essay/bowdoin-college-2019-20-supplemental-essay-guide/)\n\nFor the 250 word supplement I would choose a line that inspires some thought, and then just free-write. I found that free-writing a couple different essays helped me come up with an essay that really reflected who I am and what is important to me. In whatever you write, I suggest that it reveals something new about you.",

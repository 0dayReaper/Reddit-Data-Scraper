            "comment": "It's a pretty vague concept in general and at Bowdoin. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good) probably does the best job of explaining when it says, \"In the popular meaning, the common good describes a specific 'good' that is shared and beneficial for all (or most) members of a given community.\" It can be an all-encompassing term, so I would say that it would include both small acts of kindness and community service. Another way to put it would be, I suppose, doing something for the common good is doing a good deed unprompted to help out the general community. Community service obviously falls under that definition, but even, say, helping an old lady cross the street could technically be termed part of the common good. It's broad so anything along those lines seems like it would almost certainly work for that essay. Hope that helps!\n\nEdit: The Bowdoin website has [a page](http://www.bowdoin.edu/academics/common-good/) dedicated to the common good, in case you haven't seen that, but it's not really all that helpful in defining the term itself, probably because it's a nebulous concept.",

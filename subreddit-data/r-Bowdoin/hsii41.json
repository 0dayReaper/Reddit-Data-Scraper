    "postText": "Title. I've been saving up for a new electronic device for a few years now, and I'm seriously considering an iPad air with the Apple pencil. I should mention that I'm not going into the STEM route. Pros include that all my notes are super portable and organized, and that I can download e-books and annotate readings on the tablet. As someone who's a beginner in digital art, a tablet would also be a great way to improve my drawing skills.\n\nNot sure if laptops or other electronics are generally accepted inside Bowdoin classrooms though. When I visited pre-COVID, most people seemed to use traditional paper+pen. I know this doesn't really matter for the 2020-21 school year bc everything is online but I want to make sure buying a tablet would be a good invest for all four years. Thanks for your advice!",

If you like Apple Pencil notes on an iPad then go for it, people definitely do that. I happened to be a paper notes person who took very sparse notes. Usually I preferred to either skim long readings on either my MacBook or library computer or print them out and annotate there. This may also be dependent on your major. I\u2019d also say that your style might evolve as you progress. My note-taking in class and for readings was significantly different as a senior than when I was a freshman. Certainly iPad notes would be \u201caccepted\u201d if that\u2019s the main question, no one would second guess that.",

Some are fine with electronics in class; others are old-school, requiring students to print out all readings, and forbidding laptops in class.\n\nNow, because half of the spring 2020 semester was - and the fall 2020 semester will be - entirely remote-learning, some views may change now that suddenly all class interaction relies on zoom, teams, and other technology. \n\nBut it's hard to say, and will likely still vary, because there's no campus-wide policy that addresses it one way or the other.",

    "postText": "As someone who has been researching the university recently, I have started to fall in love with it. Below i\u2019ll put a few of my questions.\n\n1. Do you find the General Education requirements to be a burden? do they take up a lot of time, ect?\n\n2. If accepted, I want to double major in Econ and History, how good are the departments and is it a doable double major? \n\n3. How is financial aid\n\n4. How\u2019s the climate?\n\n5. Is the food really that good?\n\n6. Can you try out for sports teams? I played varsity soccer and club soccer for a lot of my life, so just wondering If i could try to tryout for the team without getting recruited?",

            "comment": "1) As a double major in two humanities fields the distribution requirements were super easy for me to fulfill and I think most people have the same experience. Super flexible and there are so many interesting classes that you can take to meet the requirements. With Econ and History you should be able to take most if not all of your distribution within those two majors.\n2) A lot of people double major. Not sure about the departments specifically. \n3) financial aid is generally pretty good, but will really depend on what need. They do all no loans which I like. Also a lot of students work on campus as part of their financial aid package which I think creates a nice culture around working. \n4) cold? From Wisconsin shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue for you. And it\u2019s a small campus so you don\u2019t really have to be outside for longer than a few minutes between classes. \n5) yes the food is that good. Lots of local food from Maine (seafood is amazing) and stuff from the organic garden. I\u2019m a huge fan of the Thorn dinning hall pre made salad bar. \n6) most teams have walk on options. There are also a lot of non varsity options for soccer (and other sports). A lot of people find that they don\u2019t actually want to commit the time needed for varsity once they get to college.",

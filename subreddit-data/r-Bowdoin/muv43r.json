I'm not sure if Pine or Stowe Inn are going to be available, but they would be easy to get (downside is they're not as nice and furthest from campus). Brunswick Apartments should be an option, maybe the Tower as well. Chamberlain is ok but only if you have friends living in the hall or plan to spend 0 time there. Main thing is to have contingency plans if the lottery doesn't go well.",

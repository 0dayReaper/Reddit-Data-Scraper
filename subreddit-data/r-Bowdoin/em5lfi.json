Professors used our first names, and encouraged us to use theirs. \n\nI loved the climate. Trudging through the silent, snow blanketed quad. \n\nI loved the classes. Pivotal Court Cases of the 20th Century, The Films of Martin Scorsese, The Psychology of Religion. \n\nI loved the other students. Now they're architects, doctors, activists and diplomats, and the dearest friends I've ever had. \n\nAll of that together created a community I am grateful and proud to be a part of. \n\nIf you get in, go. It won't be a mistake.",

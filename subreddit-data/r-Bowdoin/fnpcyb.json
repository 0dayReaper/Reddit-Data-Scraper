I was actually working in the Admissions Office this spring break, so while I do know the contents all I\u2019ll say is that the boxes have been constructed and most of the inner contents had already arrived when I left (18th) so the boxes should be shipped soon. \n\nIf you\u2019re an admitted student for 2024, know that Claudia and Dean Soule are working extremely hard to make sure this acceptance feels special, especially since there\u2019s no chance to visit (as of now).",

We\u2019re all first years but Seth Ramus handles the PreMed stuff and does like 3 big meetings every fall where anyone interested can stop by to learn about it. He\u2019s as involved as you want him to be, so some students have him look over their courses every semester, other students merely meet with him when it\u2019s time to do applications. Regardless, he\u2019s sitting in his office waiting to help students so if you want it, get in contact with him. \n\nAlso, study abroad and PreMed is do able (I know that\u2019s a conversation they had so if that\u2019s a concern for you know that it\u2019s been done in the past and will continue to be done in the future). Also, lots of random talks throughout the semester. We\u2019re always bringing in guest lecturers and some of them deal with more health/med related stuff. \n\nIf you have specific questions, feel free to PM me and I can outsource so you can get the info you want bc as of right now I\u2019m just speaking from what I\u2019ve heard them talking about and as a PreLaw person, I have literally no clue what med people think are important and what factors into a good school or not LOL so if you wanna send some more direct questions I will def get answers back to you.",

They sent a metal Bowdoin water bottle, a Bowdoin beanie, a Bowdoin Map, a cute pinecone, Maple candy, diy polar bear origami, a poster, a Bowdoin carabiner, a Bowdoin pennant, a map of Bowdoin's campus, a promo code for the Bookstore, and etc. Pretty much there was an item for each line on The Offer of the College :)\n\nEdit: typo",

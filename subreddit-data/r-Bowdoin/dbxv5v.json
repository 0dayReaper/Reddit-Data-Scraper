I was really worried about this too, but it really isn't an issue. \n\nEvery president at Bowdoin has their \"thing\". One of Clayton Rose's (our current president) things is civil discourse. There are even seminars going on on how to maximize productivity during discussions with suffering opinions. \n\nSo yeah, you'd be just fine here, regardless of political beliefs.",

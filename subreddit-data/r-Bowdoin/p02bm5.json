    "postText": "Hi, everyone! I'm currently working on my Bowdoin Application for Fall 2022 and I have a few questions I hope I could get answered. \n\nI'm really contemplating not adding in my test scores, and was wondering if this is a bad idea. I know Bowdoin is test optional, and I think my resume is pretty good, so I wanted to hear anyone else's stories not adding their scores or any info anyone could share. \n\nI also might have to take a free period my senior year as class sizes are very odd and most AP classes on my campus are only available one period, leaving me with very limited choices (I can take an AP science or an AP math, not both). I'm not sure if this is a bad idea or will prevent me from being considered. \n\nLastly, how much does Bowdoin look at rank in y'all's experiences? I have a 4.3 GPA but go to an IB school so I rank about 50/400, academics there are pretty stagnant, and many AP students like myself struggle to remain in good standing as a consequence. \n\nThank y'all very much and I hope to hear from any of you!\n\nQuick edit: I've also contacted the admissions email and had an interview!",

A rule of thumb my counselor told me was to send it if it is above the 50% of test scores of Bowdoin. If it is below the 50%, it could hurt you.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor workload, when availability of AP classes is out of your hands, colleges will probably know what classes you have available to you. Keep in mind taking one less AP will never make or break your application. Just make sure you are challenged just enough to your ability. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIDK how important class rank is, but colleges know it can be easier or harder to achieve depending on what school you go to.  \n\nBowdoin's big thing is doing things for the \"common good.\" You don't need perfect grades to get into Bowdoin so long as you really show your character and uniqueness in your interview/writing.",

    "postText": "I'm thinking of applying to Bowdoin and wondering if anyone who studied an interdisciplinary major in English and Theatre or Mathematics and Education can share what their experience was with the program, the professors and, if you graduated with those degrees, how life after school turned out.  I am also wondering if Bowdoin has any major/program equivalent to a communications degree.  \n\nThanks so much for your time and information.  ",

            "comment": "I'm a math/computer science double major, so I can really only speak a lot about the math department, but it's a really good program. I've only had good relationships with the professors, and they all have a vast knowledge of their subjects. They're typically pretty welcoming in office hours, and classes are usually no more than 25-30 students so they'll get to know your name fairly quickly. It's one of the more popular majors at Bowdoin, probably due to it pairing well with a lot of majors, as well as being a solid department.\n\nI don't know of any majors at Bowdoin similar to Communication. A list of the departments can be found [here](http://www.bowdoin.edu/academics/departments-programs/) along with the majors/minors. Sometimes there are courses offered related to communications. You can also build your own major if you feel interested in something Bowdoin doesn't offer.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to ask",

                            "comment": "Sure thing! I really like the department. For the major, there's an intro to CS class (which you can take the advanced version of if you already know some programming, or you can bypass entirely if you're good enough). Then there are 3 required classes: data structures, algorithms, and systems. Then you have to take an additional theory class, AI class, and systems class. These could be in a wide range of topics, but each class is pretty interesting. All in all, the major requires 10 classes, plus intro to CS. This means that out of the ~32 classes you'll take at Bowdoin, only a third will have to be CS classes. You're able to take more, of course, but it allows students to branch out or easily double major. [This webpage](https://www.bowdoin.edu/computer-science/requirements/prereqs.html) has an image that shows a breakdown the CS classes and the categories they fall in, although it's a little out of date.\n\nI'm a big fan of most of the professors. There are a couple who I think aren't the best teachers, but you can usually avoid them or try to take only a class or two with them. The upper-level professors are especially good. I just finished taking Artificial Intelligence and Nature-Inspired Computation this semester, and both classes were really good. Nature-Inspired in particular was neat, because we were looking at different optimizations naturally occurring in the environment, and how they can be applied to difficult CS problems.\n\nMost classes are between 10-30 students, so you'll get to know the professor over the course of the semester. Office hours are frequent enough that you can stop by a couple times a week if you need additional help or just want to get to know the professors better. Once you're a junior or senior (or occasionally as a sophomore), you can do an independent study with a professor in a subject that you're interested in. For example, next semester I'm taking a look at applying natural language processing to look at metaphors used in literature and how we can quantify some as more \"complex\" than others. If you're interested in pursuing grad school after college, you can usually find a couple professors who you could do research with over the summer.\n\nI think that covers the basics. There are definitely a couple downsides as well. There are only about 8 professors in the CS department right now. The department is growing at a rapid pace, and I think they're planning on hiring a new professor every year or so, which should alleviate that issue a bit. Some upper-level classes do get fully booked and are difficult for sophomores to get into, but you can often take mid-level classes in that time period, or talk to the professor teaching a course to see if they're willing to overbook the class by a couple students. If you want to fully commit to CS and not take classes in any other subjects, I'm not sure I'd recommend Bowdoin. But if you're considering a double major or are interested in taking several courses in a variety of subjects in addition to the major, Bowdoin might be a good fit.\n\nBowdoin leads to pretty good job prospects after college. Most CS majors go into software development, although not all of us. In terms of companies, I've got friends who worked/are going to work at Google, Apple, Disney, Stripe, Microsoft, Amazon, Epic (Systems, not the Fortnite company), Okta, etc. For me, I worked at a small startup my sophomore summer, NASA Ames during my junior summer, and now I'm applying to a variety of companies for after graduation.\n\nAre there are other questions you have/anything else I can do into detail about?",

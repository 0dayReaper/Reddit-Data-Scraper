    "postText": "So many things I've read about people choosing bowdoin begin with them saying they were sure they wanted a rural liberal arts college. I really like bowdoin, but many of the other schools I'm considering applying to are in more urban areas (mainly boston, I love it). If anyone on this sub came to bowdoin from living in a city, or chose bowdoin over other schools in more urban areas, what influenced that choice? Also, what are some pros/cons you've found about the location? As someone who finds it difficult to make friends, I'm worried about feeling isolated.",

            "comment": "Hey! hello from Bowdoin in the middle of exam szn! I come from a suburb that's like 30 minutes outside of a big city so I can't directly speak to  your question. But, i can say I wasn't one of those people who knew a more rural LAC was right for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrankly speaking, although the town is literally just across the street, I probably leave campus once every few weeks. Some kids will go into town more often for a restaurant or a visit to the grocery store, and it's not uncommon to take a weekend trip to Boston (by train it's like 2 hours) or a day trip to Portland (by bus it's like an hour). being on campus all the time is pretty well accepted and our word for it is being in the \"Bowdoin bubble\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I wouldn't let its rural location deter you. In my opinion, being at a school that's more isolated is good for making friends. As a first year you live in the same set of dorms. Having people being on campus most of the time means you'll seen them more often, you'll have more interactions with people, and you'll see your existing friends even more \ud83d\ude04",

College is busy and there\u2019s so much to do I wouldn\u2019t leave campus much even in a larger city. That being said, we have access to Portland, which is a decently sized town. You can go as much as you want, or choose not to.",

Anywho, I was one of those people you referenced who knew they wanted a small, rural college (I still applied to some urban schools) experience despite having grown up in/around NYC. I found Bowdoin to be a great place to make friends. Hopefully it hasn't changed in the 13 years since I graduated, but when I was there the student population was incredibly welcoming and friendly. The key is the common ground. Everyone who ends up in at Bowdoin BUSTED THEIR ASSES to get there. Everyone wants to work, wants to do well, and most importantly wants their fellow students to do well too. \n\nAs others have already said, please please please don't let the rural setting deter you. It's pretty, Portland isn't that far and you might actually find you like the quiet, understated beauty of coastal Maine.",

Lots of students go to Wild Oats for cafe type stuff, or some other coffee shops (I've never been). Little Tokyo is decent sushi, but the real trick there is the bento lunch combo - incredible pricing.",

Gelato Fiasco is a little overrated IMO (but still fun!). Taco the Town is definitely the most popular out of the food trucks, and is pretty good, especially the horchata. The hot dog stand is underrated. Big Top Deli has a fantastic chicken parm sandwich that not enough people talk about.",

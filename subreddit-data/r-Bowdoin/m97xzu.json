    "postText": "Hey all! I just got into Bowdoin yesterday, and I didn\u2019t know a ton about it- but now that I\u2019m in I\u2019ve really come to think it could be a good fit for me. The only issue is that I\u2019m not a massive fan of the cold. I\u2019ve grown up on the East Coast, but more in the southeast region, not the northeast. I don\u2019t like the cold very much at *all*. It doesn\u2019t snow much where I live, and it does get cold, but only for maybe three months of the year. So could someone who isn\u2019t a big fan of the cold go to Bowdoin? Is the cold totally crippling up there?",

            "comment": "Class of 2015 here. Yes, there's no downplaying it. It does, in fact, get pretty brutally cold during the winters. Winter of 2014, I don't recall the temperature going above freezing for almost a month straight. That being said, don't let the cold scare you off. I came to Bowdoin from Oklahoma, born in raised in the heat. It was a tough adjustment at first, but I came to love it. It's really a magical place, and once you get used to it, you really will come to appreciate the beauty of it. It's cold from about November-March, but lovely otherwise. I think you'll do just fine. My advice? Layer up and invest in some nice gloves and water-resistant boots (bonus points for Bean boots.)\n\nA few other things that I wish someone had told me:\n\n1. Get ready to love Connie in dining, she's the best.\n2. If you're going to study at Hubbard, go up to the second floor. That's where the best spots are at.\n3. Regardless of your major, take a film class with Tricia Welsch at some point (I was a music/gov major). She's a treasure.\n4. If you don't need to be of the center of the action, Brunswick Apartments is the chillest place to live after your first year, especially during Ivies (more on that later.)\n5. Don't sleep on the Hungarian Mushroom soup. It took me until my sophomore to try it, it's arguably the best thing they make.\n6. Get good at pepper flips ASAP.\n7. Ivies is a marathon, not a sprint. Drink water. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have questions once you get there.",

                    "comment": "Thank you! This advice is super helpful, I appreciate it. It makes me feel even better knowing someone from Oklahoma had good experience with the cold. If you don\u2019t mind answering, what was it like going to school so far from home? That\u2019s another thing I\u2019m a bit worried about. I\u2019d be nine hours away, which is kinda far, but Oklahoma is way further than that. Was it difficult moving your things back and forth/ going up for the year?",

                            "comment": "Your experience, of course, won't be identical to mine. I hated where I grew up, and I took off at light speed the instant I was old enough to leave for college. To me, Bowdoin might as well have been in a foreign country, it was so different from what I knew. I had never even been to New England prior to applying, I simply read about how great a school Bowdoin was and only visited after being accepted. Not sure where in the Southeast you're from, but unless it's an inland town of less than 500 people, Maine probably won't be as radically different to you as it was to me, so take some comfort in that. \n\nThat being said, it's VERY New England, in all of the good and a few of the bad ways. You'll come to know that region's culture extremely well, as you'll be neck-deep in it. You won't be allowed a car your freshman year, so don't expect to take too terribly much with you. However, from sophomore year on, you'll get to have a car, which is when I loaded my old car up and drove all my things out to Maine to have with me. Between school years, I would put my stuff in a shared storage locker (Cumberland Self-Storage are good folks) and come back for it at the end of the summer. It's not really a big deal, you get in a groove with it. \n\nAs for your first question...it was absolutely magical. I wouldn't trade those years for a million dollars in cash tax-free. That being said, it wasn't without difficulties. Not necessarily as a result of Bowdoin, but mostly of being in a new place with a new culture and none of your family or old friends around. Most colleges will have that same problem, unless they're in your backyard. My best advice is, remember to connect with other people. Just about every student at school will be experiencing the same occasional confusion and loneliness as you, which makes them perfect resources, since you'll all be in the same boat.\n\nFind a way to get involved with the school beyond just academics. Bowdoin has a fantastic culture that you can immerse yourself in countless ways. Try your hand at a few of them. Try a sport, join an organization...there are TONS of them. I joined the rowing team despite never having been on a boat before, for example, and hosted two radio shows with friends despite never at any point knowing what I was doing. Dip your toes in some of the various clubs for a bit and see what fits you best. If you do that, you'll make the best friends of your life. If you're lucky, then by the time you graduate, it will feel like you're leaving home.",

Everyone who goes to Bowdoin seems to love it. I think I can adapt to the cold well enough, and it seems like no matter where people are from they\u2019re doing okay up there. I\u2019ve already started checking out some of the clubs, and they look awesome. Thanks again for the advice! :)",

The thing I would really note is that it's windy as hell up here even when it gets out of the cold front. Recently it has been in the 50s but the wind really prevents it from being a pleasant day. Luckily you don't gotta be in it too much, but it does make having stuff to do in the winter kinda shit.",

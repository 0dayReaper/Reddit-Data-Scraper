If so, do you think it increased your chance of acceptance? Also, what were your credentials/strengths when you were accepted?",

            "comment": "Hi Goontroll!\n\nI did an off campus interview with a Bowdoin alumni.  I think with any sort of application process, any extra, positive information you can provide will increase your chances of acceptance.  \n\nI ended up doing off-campus alumni interviews for all of the schools I applied to - it was easier than having to travel to all of the different schools, and it was fun to meet alumni and get that perspective on the schools early on.\n\nIn terms of my credentials when I was applying to college, I had a few AP tests with good scores under my belt, was involved in a few different extra curricular activities, your general I'm-trying-to-get-into-college stuff.  I don't know if this actually made any difference, but I had also done a lot of community service during high school, and that is something that Bowdoin cares a lot about.\n\nHope that makes sense - let me know if you have any other questions about Bowdoin.",

Almost all of them were small new england liberal arts schools like Bowdoin, with a few safeties and a few long shots.  You're standard school guidance counselor advice.\n\nI dressed formally for the off campus interviews - I'm a guy, so dress shirt, nice pants, maybe a tie or a jacket but not both.  I think about what you would wear for an on-campus interview and wear the same thing.  Business casual is probably the best description.  My interviewers tended to dress similarly to me if they were men, dress or skirt with a blouse if they were women.",

If someone interviews well it can definitely give them an edge over a similarly qualified person.\n\nI have never seen someone hurt by the interview. I have never had to give a negative writeup to anyone, only neutral ones or positive ones.\n\nBottom line is that it isn't going to hurt you unless you do something outrageous.\n\nAlso, they don't put any extra weight on on-campus vs. off-campus interviews.\n\nGood luck.",

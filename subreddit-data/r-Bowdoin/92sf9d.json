    "postText": "\nHi all! I posted on r/ApStudents asking if anyone would be interested in texting college students at the colleges they are thinking about applying to in order to learn more about the school. 3 said they'd be interested in texting Bowdoin students, so now I'm looking to see if there are current Bowdoin students that would be interested in talking with these high school students and answering their questions. If you're interested, just use the google form link below.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLTrCqqpxxNJSR4clWOH1mwgxMBJjoyaAWmJviVDLMoGut7A/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\nBtw, here's the link to the initial post I made in r/ApStudents: https://www.reddit.com/r/APStudents/comments/91su5a/text_current_college_students_at_the_schools/",

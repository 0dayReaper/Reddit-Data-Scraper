    "postText": "Hi guys! With the admit days being canceled and everything I was hoping to get some feedback and opinions as to what the Bowdoin campus is like. I never got to visit it, I\u2019ve only done an online tour and seen pictures. The campus, even though there are a lot of bricks, looks to be a really beautiful campus/aesthetically pleasing (which I really like being a visual person) especially during the fall and it seems relatively medium sized too. I was hoping to get more insight about it.\nThank you so much :)",

I particularly loved it during fall and winter (4 months of snow!!)\nMy favorite building is Massachusetts hall, it looks fantastic during winter\nTo cross campus it takes around 10-15min\nYou can find an interactive map of Bowdoin online :)",

The main quad is a really nice central space where students often set up hammocks, chill doing homework, play soccer/freebie/netball, or slackline. Once it gets cold, the small campus is especially nice since you never have to be outside for very long if you don't want to. I love the way all of the trees on campus look right after it snows. When it gets cold enough facilities has a small ice rink on the quad which is very cute. Aesthetically I think it\u2019s gorgeous and part of the main library (and the art library) faces the main quad where you can see all the trees turning colors in the fall. \n\nUpperclassmen students housing tends to be within 5 minutes walk from main campus which has its pros and cons. \n\nOne thing that I also love about campus is that we are right next to a huge trail network. So if you\u2019re into running, mountain biking, or cross-country skiing you can easily walk into the woods right next to campus. \n\nMy only downside to campus is that when it rains there are huge puddles everywhere when it rains and it can get icy during the winter. Facilities does their best, but not much one can do about puddles.",

            "comment": "It really depends on what interests you; there are a ton of great courses at Bowdoin. One of my personal favorites (and the one that got me to come to Bowdoin in the first place) was Nature-Inspired Computation. It\u2019s a CS class that looks at optimizations used in nature, such as ant colony optimization or particle swarm optimization (loosely based on flying birds), and implements them to solve basic problems that humans can face. There are also fungal mold algorithms that perform surprisingly well at solving very specific problems. \n\nCognitive Architecture is another amazing class that focuses on how the brain is built and what allows it to perform tasks well. It\u2019s kind of a mix between computer science, psychology, and neuroscience. It was a breath of fresh air in the CS department since we don\u2019t often get to take courses for the major that primarily consist of readings and discussion.\n\nOutside of my majors, I really enjoyed NGOs in Politics (a first year seminar) and Intro to Africana Studies. I had an amazing professor for Africana Studies, and the course on NGOs really let me work on improving my writing while also learning about a pretty interesting subject matter.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I hope quarantine is treating you well. The things I might say in this post might sound very jump-the-gun to everyone, and with good reason. I am currently enrolled to attend Rutgers University-New Brunswick in the fall (though, to be fair, COVID-19 is wreaking havoc upon any and all future plans right now) and was considering a few schools to transfer to, such as Bowdoin. Perhaps I might not even need to transfer if I enjoy the campus and the school enough; but after some slip-ups during high school, this is where I am. Living in close proximity to Rutgers for 4 years gave me a certain perspective; and I think Rutgers may not be as academically fulfilling and/or have a range of clubs/extracurriculars I want to continue from high school. It would be really helpful if some people could share some of their experiences at Bowdoin to give me a idea of how the vibe there might be. Thanks in advance!",

From what I understand, though, it's very difficult to get in to Bowdoin as a transfer student, so be sure to consider all your options.\n\nThat being said, I really enjoyed Bowdoin overall because of 1) the academics, 2) the students and 3) the aura. Classes are niche, interesting, and small, with (usually) great and friendly professors. Students are well-rounded, kind, non-competitive, interesting, and engaged with the world around them. There's also an air of collaboration, intellectual curiosity, diversity, and openness to learn about the experiences of others. \n\nOf course, there are also negatives like any school, but that wasn't your question :)",

            "comment": "It was a meltdown. We were looking really strong up until the third period (winning 5-3 at one point like you said). Then it just collapsed. The defense kind of stopped functioning and Cronin (the goalie) gave up a well shot goal and then immediately after that a fluke goal.\n\nI think our confidence left there and Amherst was able to take advantage of that. They got a couple of fast breaks and scored on each of them to make it 7-5. We got several good shots off in that time period, but nothing went in. With 2 minutes to go, Cronin was removed and we put six players forward, but couldn't score, and Amherst broke away again to make it an easy 8-5. ",

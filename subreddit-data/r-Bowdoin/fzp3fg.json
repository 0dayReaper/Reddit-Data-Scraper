            "comment": "I'm not sure what the maximum is, but here are some details:\n* you need at least 2 years on campus, including 2 semesters during junior and senior year\n* I think you need to do your entire first year on campus\n* you only get 4 credits per semester if you're abroad\n\nBasically, most people study abroad during junior year, but its flexible. I know some people who are gone for the whole year, and others who did a semester in sophomore year and then another later on. Summer stuff is also an option like the other commenter said - I know someone trying to do a program at Oxford or something like that.",

I have a couple of questions regarding the general environment at Bowdoin.\n1. How\u2019s the night life/party life at Bowdoin? \n2. Is public speaking an activity that Bowdoin college is passionate about? \n3. The sense I an getting from reading a-lot of reviews is that its a very sports oriented college, someone who is particularly not into sports is adjusting going to be difficult? \n4. How\u2019s the diversity at Bowdoin, and how are the international students treated? \n5. Is working at the college campus, something common?",

There\u2019s 1 or two campus wide parties every weekend out on by the social houses (sophomore\u2019s living in converted frat houses) and usually clubs/teams will throw parties pretty often. As someone who did not party at all in HS this was plenty for me, but if you\u2019re expecting tons of wild parties this will probably disappoint you. Generally good parties are smaller and thrown by upperclassmen in their house/ apartment.\n2. I guess? There are lots of clubs that are debate/ discussion centered. And sometimes you will have to do presentations for class or research opportunities. Not sure what you mean by this question. \n3. Lots of students play sports but sports do not control the social scene. If you\u2019re on a sports team that will likely becomes your core group of friends be you will spend so much time together, but much of campus life is centered around your clubs and activities. I don\u2019t do any organized sport and I\u2019ve never found it to be an issue for me. \n4. Diversity is about what you\u2019re going to get at any elite liberal arts school. Administration tries it\u2019s best. Lots of race/culture clubs who host events. There\u2019s many international students and I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s not too bad. There was some upset from the international students about not being allowed to stay on campus when they made everyone leave. Can\u2019t say I know a ton about it though.  \n5. Working is super common and well respected. There are many opportunities to work an on campus job.",

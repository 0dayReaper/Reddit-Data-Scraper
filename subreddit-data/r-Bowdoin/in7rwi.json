Think about why you want to go... if it's for presumed prestige, to claim to your high school peers that you got into a selective school in a sort of pissing contest that gets old before you even get to college or if it's because you think it will connect you to an awesome job, wealth, power, the good life etc., you need to reconsider your priorities as neither Bowdoin,  or any other school will deliver on such things.  If something there clicks for you,  the culture, a particular program of study, the location,  etc. , those are things to work with when deciding where to apply.",

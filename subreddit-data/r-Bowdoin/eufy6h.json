    "postText": "Hello! I'm looking forward to attending Bowdoin next year, and I'm currently looking into the different music groups. I've played in my school's orchestra for 8 years as principal violist, but I'm weak in my theory/technique because I've never had private lessons and my director was more band-oriented. I know I can rent instruments from the school, but I'm not sure if it's worth auditioning into the orchestra next year. I looked into previous repertoire and it certainly looks a lot more challenging than what I'm used to but I think I could handle it with a lot of practice and building my skills. Thoughts? Thank you for your help!! :D",

There are also individual music lessons available, usually for free if you're on financial aid",

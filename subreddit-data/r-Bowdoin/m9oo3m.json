    "postText": "Hi! I'm an international HS senior who was just admitted to Bowdoin. I'm super excited about it and I really wanted to settle on Bowdoin, but there are 2 things that are making me a bit hesitant. I'm from a big bustling city and have been used to the scene my whole life. I realize going to Brunswick would be a huge change, but is it really that bad? I'm also rather concerned about diversity at Bowdoin/Brunswick in general. I'd be an Asian international student, which puts me in two categories of minorities. How bad is the lack of diversity, and does everyone only stick to their identity group or is it mixed? \n\nCurrently I'm considering between Bowdoin and a liberal arts program in Amsterdam, which beats Bowdoin in the location and diversity. But I really love other aspects about Bowdoin, so it just comes down to whether those two things can be looked past. I'm really struggling with this so any help would be amazing. Thanks a lot in advance!!",

While Brunswick feels small, Bowdoin actually is not super isolated as there are trains to Boston and buses that can you South to the city of Portland. Also, Portland and Brunswick also house many great Asian restaurants!",

            "comment": "As for the diversity, I think Bowdoin has become better. When I entered Bowdoin in 2017, the lack of diversity is quite severe. But I think they have realized the issue and have truly improved. There are around 30 international students in the class of 2021 but the class of 2023 has around 50. I personally feel that whether to stick to one's own identity group is more of a choice, but sticking to one's own group is not uncommon. Still, diversity is not a field that Bowdoin has an edge on.",

I relate a lot to what you\u2019re saying\u2014I\u2019m also an international student from a huge city and I had the exact same reservations and thoughts as you do now. I\u2019ll say that I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised. If you don\u2019t mind exploring a small American town setting for your college years, Brunswick would be the perfect place for many reasons: its setting, architecture, culture, sights, people (or for certain months of the year) weather. You won\u2019t find a whole lot of shopping malls or skyscrapers here, but I\u2019m super happy to have discovered lots of nature spots like parks and beaches. Maine really has the best to offer when it comes to its landscape and environment.  \n\nFor a small town, Brunswick actually has an incredible array of restaurants serving cuisines from many cultures. The longer you\u2019re here the more spots you discover (or, if you do choose to commit, I\u2019d be happy to show you around). I\u2019ve been here for a year and a half straight now without going hole because of COVID, and these restaurants really satisfy my need for tastes of home. \n\nHope this helps and good luck with your decision!",

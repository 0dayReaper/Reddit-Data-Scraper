I think what helped was I applied and got rejected from the fly-in program idk if they take into consideration for demonstrated interest or something like that. \n\nMy ACT: 33 \nAp scores: lit (4), world history (3), calc ab (4), psych (5) \nGPA: 4.76, 4.0\n\nAnd then I got a 2 for basically anything else I took but I didn\u2019t report those. So not that great I\u2019m a pretty much ordinary person otherwise. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve never done this before is there anything else I was suppose to include so sorry if I missed anything please tell me and I\u2019ll try my best to answer it as soon as possible!\n\nP.S. Did u guys get a text today telling u decisions for Bowdoin were coming out?",

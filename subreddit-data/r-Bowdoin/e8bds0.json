I think the only caveat to be aware of is that there is no \u201cofficial track\u201d for pre med. you can get a pre med advisor and they list all the classes you should take to meet all of your requirements and the advisor will get you set up for taking the MCAT and applying. There just isn\u2019t a \u201cpre med\u201d major.\n\nI think almost everyone I know who went into medicine majored in biochem, chemistry, or regular bio. Though, I know one person who was a chemistry minor and a Russian Language major and she is now a highly successful specialist. So you can get it done either way but you just have to make sure you take all of your prerequisites.\n\nI\u2019d also *highly* suggest getting no less than a B or B+ in every class you take and preferably an A in all the prerequisites.",

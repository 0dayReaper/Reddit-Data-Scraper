Even if you don't see yourself as a super-unique individual, you can absolutely sell yourself in a unique way. Friends of mine who work senior admissions always talk about \"The kid who runs cross-country, does one other extra-curricular, has good grades and is interested in neuroscience,\" because that's a LOT of their applicants. Talk about an interest of yours in detail, show you're passionate about something and talk about why you love this school specifically. Making an impression there is a key step in the application process.\n\nOther than that, focusing on the common good in your supplement essay is definitely a good call. Bowdoin really digs selflessness and giving back to the community.",

            "comment": "Having done alumni interviews for a few years now I can tell you what I like to see in the interviews.\n\n1) I like to see someone who is interested in Bowdoin.\n\nI think this one gets overlooked sometimes. I interviewed a lot of very interesting candidates. Kids who were obviously very bright, very involved, would probably do great at Bowdoin. However, when I interviewed a candidate that really knew a thing or two about the school and could articulate *specific* reasons why they liked Bowdoin that was always a plus. There are a lot of schools out there and some are even almost as good as Bowdoin. Why are you interested in Bowdoin specifically.\n\n2) I like to see someone that has some dedication to something.\n\nIt is really too late in the game to get dedicated to something. But, I cannot tell you how many times I had people that would go on about a mission trip they did or some project and almost forget to tell me that they had been doing theater tech since sixth grade and was now in charge of lighting for every play at their school. Stuff like that.\n\nI like hearing about interesting events or trips but I also want to hear about something you are dedicated to. If you played sports for 4 years, if you founded a club, if you have something that you have stuck with for a long time, let your interviewer know.\n\n3) If you have done something particularly novel or interesting, flesh it out.\n\nToo many people will just say \"oh I did this amazing thing.\" That is wonderful, I like hearing about interesting stuff. What I want to hear is why that was meaningful to *you*. I especially like hearing about things you did to follow up on it. What did you take away from this one time experience and what did you do about it. If you went on a volunteer trip somewhere and then came home and started an annual fundraiser, you definitely want to talk about those two things together.\n\n4) Finally, talk about your school a little bit.\n\nBowdoin is a very small community. There are people that go to bigger high schools. Anything you did to enhance your school's community should be mentioned. I love hearing about folks who start clubs, work on school events, participate in school fundraisers, etc. It doesn't have to be student council. It doesn't even have to be an official thing,\n\nAlso, feel free to brag about your school a bit. It is good when someone has pride in their school. Most people that graduate from Bowdoin have a lot of pride in their school. Don't rag on rival schools but feel free to say what you love about your school and what your school is particularly excellent in.\n\n**ALSO, if you haven't scheduled an interview DO IT NOW.** Dec. 6 (*tomorrow*) is the deadline for off campus interview signups. [The web form is here](http://www.bowdoin.edu/admissions/forms/interview/off-campus.shtml). The info page [is here](http://www.bowdoin.edu/admissions/contact/in-your-area.shtml). It is suuuper easy to sign up and getting an interview is always a plus. It is also a good way to ask an alumnus questions about the school. They are often fairly recent grads.\n\nGood Luck.\n",

It's no mystery that there are factors taken into account during the admissions process that can override below-average (for Bowdoin) high school academic performance. One of these factors is athletic talent. I have no problem with it, and I'm not making any value judgment.",

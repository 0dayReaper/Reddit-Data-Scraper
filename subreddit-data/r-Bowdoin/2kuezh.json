    "postText": "putting in a plug for the bowdoin art society's show, 340 miles north. it's in ladd house, and it's wicked cool. it's 100% student art, and there is some crazy-impressive stuff there. we have some talented peers! (make sure you check out the tiny book in the front room. it's amazing.) bring your parents, bring your siblings, bring your friends. bring your weird cousin and your host family. make sure to check out the installation in the basement. it's intense!",

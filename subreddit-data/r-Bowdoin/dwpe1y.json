    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI hope that title made sense, but I just wanted to check if anyone here knows of any of the acceptance rates for the HS seniors that were selected for the Explore Program. I attended the first session and somebody asked this question but I frankly forget the answer as it was never concrete. \n\nI just finished my ED I application and I am very, very nervous to submit it, to say the least. If anyone knows anything, please let me know, thank you!\n\nEdit: I got in :,) I\u2019m so happy",

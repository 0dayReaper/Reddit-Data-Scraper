It seems like people on here are saying that it\u2019s mostly upper class white jocks (which like are a quite decisive group for us gays\u2026) is that true? Could said jocks maybe be gay?",

And even though it sometimes seems like mostly upper class white jocks, I think there\u2019s enough diversity and different groups you can join so it doesn\u2019t feel like that all the time!",

            "comment": "I'm not gay, but since there aren't many answers I'll give it my best shot. Bowdoin is generally welcoming for gay people -- some of those jocks are almost certainly gay, and the the student body as a whole is overwhelmingly liberal (at least socially -- a lot of rich people don't want to pay taxes, but don't mind if you're gay). But it's a small school and the dating pool is small even if you're straight. Just to do some very rough numbers, if there are 2000 people at Bowdoin, half of them are men, and 5% are gay or bisexual, that leaves 50 potential partners. Most parties and the hookup scene are pretty heteronormative (or were when I was there, I graduated a couple of years ago) so it might be hard to find them. On the other hand there are friend groups and student clubs with more gay people, so it might be easy to find them. Someone who's actually gay would know better, hopefully one of them will answer. There's always Tinder/Grindr/etc. and Portland is a 20 minute drive or a long and inconvenient bus ride away to open up some more options",

Also dating at Bowdoin is pretty horrible since if u break up bad then you literally cannot avoid them for 4 years since its such a small school lol. but yeah definitely not a good choice in terms of guy queer dating scene.",

There\u2019s some nice support / programming through the sexuality, women and gender center and also a pretty nice queer party scene. Overall a super accepting place (I\u2019ve pretty much never had issues with being trans/queer). I can\u2019t speak to the sports teams as much, but I think it\u2019s a good place to be gay.",

It\u2019s not perfect, nowhere is, but overall I had an amazing experience and found a strong trans community. I never had a negative experience or felt othered because of my transness. They started a lived name program a few years ago (if you want to change your name in the Bowdoin system you just send in a little form and it gets changed everywhere which is so convenient) and people are generally pretty conscious about asking for pronouns / not assuming people\u2019s genders. It\u2019s a college that really takes the motto \u201ccommitment to the common good\u201d seriously, so most people are pretty inclusive and very kind. \n\nFor first years only, housing is assigned and gender segregated by room (but mixed gender floors and gender neutral bathrooms). In the housing intake survey, they have a text box to self describe your gender and if you have specific comments / concerns there\u2019s space to add them. I said I was non-binary and specifically asked to be roomed with another trans student and was matched with another trans-masc first year. After first year, you can live with whoever you want. There are no gender segregated dorms or houses. It\u2019s totally normal for people to share a room / apartment with people of other genders.",

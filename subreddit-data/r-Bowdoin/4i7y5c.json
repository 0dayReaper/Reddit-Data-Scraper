There are 3-4 bands who mainly do party music, there's some ska, there's Accept the Mystery who play hardcore punk/metal with some covers like you asked, there is (I think was after this year) Floating Goat who play mostly folk, and there was some African music fusion going on too. I'm currently not in a band but me and a few others are likely to start one soon mostly playing indie rock. \n\nHope that helps, and if you have committed I'm very glad to have more musicians on campus haha",

            "comment": "Bowdoin is what you make of it. If you want to play in a punk/metal band, find a few friends and do it. While I was there, a wannabe chef opened a gourmet restaurant with some assistance from the school. \n\nWhile I was there years ago, music tended to be pop oriented.  However, by the time I graduated, a ska band had taken root in campus and was the most popular thing going. \n\nSo do your thing. \n\nAlso get involved in WBOR. Their metal section is amazing.",

Not sure if there's a punk or metal band but I'm sure you could fine people who are interested. \n\nBowdoin has a great atmosphere and everyone is really friendly - probably my favorite thing. Also extremely academic oriented. Expect the party scene and athletics to be underwhelming compared to other schools",

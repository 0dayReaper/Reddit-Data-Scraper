    "postText": "Hey, hope y'all are enjoying summer. I am a rising senior ('21/'25) and was interested in applying for the Explore Bowdoin program. How do the acceptance rates look for that program, and does getting accepted or denied help or hurt your chances of admission when you ultimately apply? For context, I am considered lower-middle-class and have qualified for a lot of financial at my school, which is private. \n\nFor anybody accepted into that program in the past, are there any tips or pointers you would like to give?  \n\nThanks guys!",

            "comment": "Hey! Class of '23, technically now '24 (cuz gap year for corona). I'm also considered lower-middle class, and I did end up doing Explore Bowdoin. While I was there, I asked one of the admissions officers about acceptance rates of EB kids, and the response was \"roughly 70% of EB students are accepted at some point in the admissions process.\" So yeah, it's a good indicator that you'll get in. Not perfect though. That's also to say, you could be rejected from EB and still be accepted later. \n\nBest of luck!",

Seriously, there's no better time to fly all over the country for free than when looking for future homes. It's a great time, and there's pretty much no risk. Also, some schools will reject you but still give you an application fee waiver, which is super helpful down the line. \n\nThanks! I plan to make the best of it.",

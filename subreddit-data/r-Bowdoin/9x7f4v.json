    "postText": "So I have another question if anyone can help me out.  I am interested in Elementary Ed. and/or Communications.  Bowdoin doesn't have either as a separate major or minor.  I see that Education is a choice as a combined major but is that Elem Ed. or Secondary Ed?  Am I missing something?  Are Elem Ed. or Communications possible majors if done as a student designed major?  Is their anyone out there who has done this and if so what does designing your own major entail and how did it go?\n\nThanks so much for your time and answers in advance.  ",

I knew a Southern Studies major who focused on Civil War history and Southern literature. \n\nThat said, your major does not dictate your career. I was English &amp; Geology and now I\u2019m an airline pilot. That\u2019s the beauty of a liberal arts education. You have a good enough background to do anything. \n\nThe Ed. Minor will cover any elementary education stuff you want (I took a few classes).\n\nAs far as communications, go work at WBOR or the TV channel. That will give you plenty of experience without being a \u201cCommunications Major.\u201d Another Polar Bear worked for years at various TV stations despite an English Lit major. There are several Alumnae in various television roles including ABC\u2019s Cynthia McFadden, CNN\u2019s Judy Fortin, and others. \n\nTL;DR your major doesn\u2019t dictate what you will do. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity to study anything you want at Bowdoin. ",

            "comment": "The education major will work for a career in elementary ed. Bowdoin has no communications department, degree, or classes and even bans us from taking them abroad, so if that's really your passion you might want to look elsewhere. On the other hand, depending on what draws you to communications you might be happy with a major like english or theater and getting involved with the newspaper and similar clubs/extracurriculars",

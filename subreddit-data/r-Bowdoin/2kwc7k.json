Is there any other information I should know about the interview?\n\nI am very excited yet anxious for this interview. I am applying ED so this is my top choice as well!",

            "comment": "I have done alumni interviews for Bowdoin for a while. They basically go the same as the on campus interviews but just aren't on campus.\n\nDefinitely have good answers for why you want to go to Bowdoin specifically. Even though you applied early decision the interviewer will want to know why you picked Bowdoin beyond \"oh I liked campus\" or \"it has a great reputation.\" Why did you choose Bowdoin out of all the other small liberal arts colleges?\n\nThe interviewers want to see you are interested in and dedicated to something over a long period. If you played a sport all four years of high school that is great, if you not only played that sport for your high school but was also a team captain or helped coach a kids team that is even better. Highlight things that you have done over an extended period of time or gotten deeply into.\n\nNext, highlight anything that shows initiative. Did you found a club? Did you start a big charity drive? Did you join an organization and better it in some way where you had the idea?\n\nFinally, highlight anything interesting you have done. If you have done something unique that your peers have not done.",

In general, be prepared to give a good response about why you're choosing Bowdoin--given that you're doing ED this should be fairly easy.",

Have something more interesting to say with regard to why you're selecting Bowdoin that \"I liked it.\" Why? Tell us why you're unique and what makes you special - what will make you, specifically, a good fit for the school? My interviews tend to run between 30 min to an hour, depending on the student.",

    "postText": "Hey there,\n\nI'm a junior in high school right now and I had a huge upward trend from sophomore year. \n\nSo basically I was going through some tough times in freshman year, and I finished with a 2.1. But in sophomore year I took 1 AP class and 2 honors classes and got a 4.0, right now in junior year I have a 4.0 and I'm taking 3 AP classes (chem, bio, and lang) My plan for senior year is to also get a 4.0 UW and take 3 AP classes. I'm a smart kid, it's just that I fucked up freshman year and now I'm stressed as fuck. I want to go to Bowdoin since their med school acceptance rate is pretty high and I like Maine. I was wondering if y'all could give me your opinion if I have a good chance or not.\n\nI also have some pretty decent EC's (8) and my essay is going to be something I'm really passionate about (chess.)",

Growth and learning are definitely good qualities to have. If there\u2019s a place where you can explain what happened and how much you\u2019ve grown from it, I would suggest doing so. Bowdoin\u2019s acceptance rate is pretty low, so be realistic but you\u2019ve got a fighting chance.",

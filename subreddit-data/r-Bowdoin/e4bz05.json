    "postText": "I am a senior applying to Bowdoin as ED II and have a good IB predicted score- but I take math studies and I have a 5 there. Should I even bother applying? I am Indian, go to a very unique high school (UWC) and have decent ECs in areas that I am interested in.\n\nI love Bowdoin, and it really sounds wholesome, please tell me if I should keep my hopes up or not!\n\nThe subject sI take are PHilosophy (7), English Lit (7) and visual arts HL(6), bio(6) , Spanish ab (5) and math studies SL (5)",

Hopefully there's another Indian on here who understands your grades better.\n\nThat said, while the admissions process is pretty mysterious, they will often overlook mediocre grades or test scores if your essays, recommendations, etc. are really good. Good luck",

Bowdoin values diversity and uniqueness in applicants, and it sounds like you have a unique background. You mentioned going to UWC. One of my friends went to UWC before coming to Bowdoin. \nAs for the IB scores, I don\u2019t know too much about the IB program, but Bowoin values more than just test scores, so I would encourage you to go ED II if you really like the school. That\u2019s what I did and I don\u2019t regret it. \nGood luck and feel free to message me if you have any more questions!",

    "postText": "My partner and I were told we could live in an old family friend's house in DC after the school closed. After we arrived they seem to be having second thoughts on hosting us (for many reasons mainly due to the feeling of responsibility, long germ isolation, and resources). We are now in DC and looking for a place that may be willing to host us. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions, or just could find away to help us out. If we are able to we are willing to travel. We both don't have a real home to go back to and anything would be of help.",

From the emails it seems like a limited number of students can still stay on campus, like internationals students and possible those in y\u2019all\u2019s circumstance. Stay strong",

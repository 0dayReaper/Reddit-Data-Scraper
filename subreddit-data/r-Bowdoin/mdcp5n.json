Current students, is there anything I should know about the admissions process, specifically relating to Bowdoin? How do you think you made your personality shine through for your acceptance? I know that Bowdoin is very personal and holistic with admissions, which is why I ask. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Doing the optional video response at all shows some character. Make sure to ask questions about the school in your interview and clearly state why you want to go to bowdoin. In your common app essay or the supplement, make sure you show how you care for your community/others/the world, or \u201cheart\u201d as the admissions staff likes to call it. Basically don\u2019t just focus on yourself but how you want to impact the world around you and make a difference. Hope this helps!",

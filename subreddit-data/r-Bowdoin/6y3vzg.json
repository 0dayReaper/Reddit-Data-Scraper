    "postText": ".....Ok. I'm interested in Bowdoin. But I have one thing I can't seem to find too much about. What is the bathroom situation like? I don't really like being in the bathroom with other people, and so I just wanted to know if there are private bathrooms that one could use if they prefer doing their business in privacy. (Throwaway acc because... of the nature of this question). Also, in dorms, are there bathrooms to be shared by a whole group, or bathrooms for the people in the bedroom alone? This feels really silly but the level of stress this gives me is unreal ._. Thanks for answering!!",

            "comment": "As a first year in Hyde hall my knowledge of the bathroom situation is very limited but for my floor it works like this: 2 bathrooms for men and women (and I think some floors or halls might have gender less ones and for all I know since I've only been here a couple of weeks mine might too somewhere lol). These bathrooms are usually empty when I go in so I definitely feel that I have plenty of privacy and my floor actually has the most people on it of all the freshman floors so chances are it will be even less crowded for you. Also there are a few private showering rooms and I've never had to wait for someone else to finish to use one of those.  Hope this helps!",

            "comment": "In most of the dorms, there are no single restrooms. A few apartment-style singles have their own, but it's rare. Depending on the building, there may be restrooms on each floor, or in each suite. All of the first year dorms have multi-stall bathrooms on each floor. Depending on the dorm, the showers may be individual stalls directly off the hallway, with full doors; or multiple stalls within the men's / women's room.\n\nIn academic and other buildings around campus, there's a wide mix of facilities - some buildings have single bathrooms, others have larger, multi-stall ones, and some have a mix of the two.\n\nThere have been updates made in some buildings to create gender-neutral restroom spaces that are either individual stall restrooms, or  have stall dividers and doors that go all the way floor-to-ceiling around each toilet, but still have shared sinks.",

            "comment": "There are single-occupant, genderless bathrooms sprinkled around campus that you can use, but in your freshman hall you'll share a bathroom (with private stalls) with everyone of your gender on your floor. After freshman year, and definitely after sophomore year, as you get higher housing lottery picks, you should be able to get an apartment-style dorm with a single-occupant bathroom that you only share with your roommate/roommates.

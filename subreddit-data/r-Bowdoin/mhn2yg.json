Bowdoin\u2019s near the top of my list but I\u2019m not sure if there are enough places for medical internships, research, and job experiences in the area. I\u2019d really appreciate it if someone could let me know!",

There is an office specifically to advise pre-med and they can get you hooked up with internships or research opportunities. During the school year you can definitely find medically related opportunities and there are tons of opportunities during summer break.",

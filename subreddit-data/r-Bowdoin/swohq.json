            "comment": "Take a mothafuckin year off, semester off, something off, sometime in the middle of your college experience. Go do something unofficial, move to a city, get a shitty job that'll pay for rent and not too much more. This experience was forced upon me, and I'm so happy it was. I wouldn't give it up for the world. College will always be there for you when you get back, no need to indulge in the social conditioning and programming of \"four years high school, four years undergrad, either job or grad school...\" \n\nBreak the mold! Piss some people off! Go out and get yourself some authentic experience. And this doesn't guarantee safety, this doesn't guarantee the comfortable lifestyle most of us are accustomed to. This almost guarantees the opposite. I've realized, as many of you might have already, that a sheltered lifestyle is both a blessing and an undeniable curse, and you're gonna have a bad time if you don't recognize what about it is a curse. \n\nSo seriously, go do something genuine, original, unofficial. Try to stay away from school sponsored programs and things of that nature, at least this one time, and do you. You might buy a ticket to Europe and have NO CLUE what to do when you get there! That's perfect! Basically, if your plan would make the standard blue blooded suburban parent blanch, do it up. \n\nYou'll always be able to return to the high class lifestyle. Your chance to experience a less sheltered reality should be embraced.",

The experiences I had at Bowdoin, where it didn't matter if I failed, gave me the courage and self-awareness to pursue them. ",

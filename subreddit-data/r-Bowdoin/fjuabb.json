    "postText": "Hi guys! I recently got admitted to Bowdoin and I\u2019m hoping to double major or minor in either English and Political Science. I was wondering what it\u2019s like being either one of the those majors. What\u2019s the English/Poli Sci department like? The professors and courses? How are the connections and the opportunities? The job prospects post graduate? \nAlso, if experienced, what\u2019s it like double majoring at Bowdoin? \nThank you so much for the help ^_^",

            "comment": "The government department here is highly ranked. Small class sizes mean you\u2019ll get the attention you need. As you comb the works of Aristotle, Hamilton, Rousseau, and friends you\u2019ll always have a professor who wants you to come to office hours and bring together ideas. Your courses are discussion focused. Your peers will inspire you.\n\nI\u2019m a double major is economics and math but I have taken many government courses. Don\u2019t settle on your major before college. Especially a double. Take time and explore. There is time senior year to finish what needs to be done. The major requirements are light, only 9 or so classes each.\n\nUnless you have a specific career path in mind (which most of us don\u2019t) your major doesn\u2019t really matter. Choose a path that inspires you and follow it. Your degree will open doors. It\u2019s up to you to have the courage to step inside.",

            "comment": "By the way, a student faculty ratio is not equivalent to the class size. Many research universities have tenured faculty who only teach one course or rely heavily on TAs. This decreases the ratio without providing the mentorship. At bowdoin we are a teaching college. The professors know that and are more focused on us than their work.",

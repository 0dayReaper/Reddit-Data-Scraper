    "postText": "I really love Bowdoin, but would like to get a better feel for its social life! \n\n- What is the social life like? \n\n- How long do the parties go till? \n\n- Does the school security get people in trouble for drinking?  \n\n- Are the party\u2019s small and cliquey or can you go from one party to another in a single night?  \n\n- What are the social houses? \n\n- Do the athletes control the social scene? \n\n\u2022 If multiple students could reply that would be great so I can get different perspectives!",

            "comment": "1. Mine is dominated by sports, my roommates, and collaborative homework sessions, but it's really what you make of it.\n\n2. Not that late, usually they're over by 2 am often well before then.\n\n3. The security officers really only care about safety, so they're your friend and not to get you (unless you do something dangerous or dumb and get their attention).\n\n4. It really depends. The social houses and some others tend to have big open parties. Many people like to have smaller events with just their friends or teammates, and those become more common as people become juniors or seniors.\n\n5. The social houses are basically party-hosting organizations staffed by sophomores, but they also organize smaller events for affiliated first-year floors. I think they're a great solution to the desire for big yet open entry parties.\n\n6. I wouldn't say that athletes control the social scene, but there are a lot at Bowdoin. A lot of athletes find their social life is tied to their teammates, and also most of the off-campus houses that host parties/events are sports-dominated. But because they are off campus and don't run the social houses it's not really a big deal.",

    "postText": "I'm a Junior in highschool and I run Track and Cross Country. I got letter from Bowdoin coach \"LJ\" where she said her and the coaching staff was interested in me attending the school and running for their school. I never heard of the school prior and was going to apply to the United States Naval Academy. I have some questions: \n\n1. What is it like to compete in Division 3\n2. Is there an indoor track\n3. How is the weight room\n4. Do they offer financial support for athletes\n5. Is there an NROTC program offered by Bowdoin\n6. How much Debt will I have after\n7. Is the school good compared to larger schools (Navy, UNC, UVA...) \n8. Is the food actually good\n9. Is there a lot of snow\n10. Are there good running trails\n\nI know these questions are random but I know literally nothing about the school",

            "comment": "Hi, I am currently on the track and cross country team at Bowdoin. Competing in Diii so far has been amazing. Our team has a variety of skill levels, and it's a supportive team. The Nescac league has many top teams in Diii for both track and xc, so there is good competition. In addition, we run some meets like BU (one of the fastest indoor tracks in the US), where we run against DI schools. The weight room is pretty good. It is in the center of campus, so it's close to first-year dorms but further away from where we practice. I don't think we offer specific financial support for our athletes outside of the regular financial aid. Unfortunately, I don't know if we have an NROTC program at Bowdoin. I would say the food is pretty good. Sometimes its pretty repetitive, but overall high quality and a good amount. There is a good amount of snow, and you will have to get used to running in the snow during the winter. The running trails, I would say, are fine. We run on dirt trails during xc through a trail network called the Brunswick Commons. We also do a bunch of runs to the ocean. Unfortunately, most trails are hard to run in during the winter due to snow, so we have to run on paved bike paths and roads. I hope that helped, but if you want to talk more, feel free to DM me.",

            "comment": "Hi I graduated somewhat recently so I can answer some of your questions but not all. D3 is as i understand it less intense than D1. People still get competitive but its lower stakes and maybe for track the level is overall lower. The weight room is pretty good in my opinion, but I'm no gym expert. There is an indoor track, but it is not banked if you're looking for that. The food is good, but I think it depends a bit on your tastes (attempts at some ethnic quisines were lacking in flavor to me).\n\nOutside: there is snow and winter is cold, but not as much snow as say Boston or the midwest because of the maritime climate. There are good running trails in town and the rural roads are quite nice in fall and spring/summer. The outdoor track is newish and nice I think?\n\nYou can find a lot about finances etc. on the admissions part of the website, but if I remember correctly athletes do not get a lot of preferential treatment (especially compared to D1). Similarly idk about NROTC but I imagine there isn't a school official program, more like you could try to satisfy navy requirements while there?\n\nAs for academics it is very good, but because it is small and not a research institution resources in some areas are limited. So for examble the humanities or biology bowdoin is excellent, but not so much for engineering. If you have an idea what you want to study look into that and see if the program looks strong.",

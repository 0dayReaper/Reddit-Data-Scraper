    "postText": "I graduated high school in 2014 and, after being waitlisted, then ultimately rejected from Bowdoin, completed my freshman year at a mid-size urban party school. I don't hate my school, but I am still attracted to Bowdoin's more challenging academics and smaller size, and I'm thinking of applying this fall to transfer and enter as a junior in 2016. I also ran cross country in high school, and could have competed for Bowdoin. I had a meeting with the coach that went well, but I decided I didn't want to run in college. Now I've changed my mind and am looking to get back in running shape this summer, and this fall will pursue transferring to/running at Bowdoin for fall 2016.\n\nDo you guys think I'd even have a chance at being admitted, especially as a transfer/previous reject? Or even if I did get in, what would it be like socially/academically to be a junior who just transferred in? My current major is public health, so I'd want to switch to either biochem, sociology or math at Bowdoin.",

Transferring to a top-tier liberal arts school can be very hard as they have a high retention rate; however, it's absolutely worth trying as it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  If you are unhappy at your current school, apply to a lot of places, and if you get in, go!  You only go through college once and it's ungodly expensive, so you might as well get the experience you want out of it.  At least at Bowdoin, I wouldn't worry about assimilation -- people are friendly, and if you are too, you'll have no problem making friends and getting involved.  I made great new friends every year I was at Bowdoin.",

            "comment": "Agreed with maineiac. I've also heard that it can be quite hard to assimilate into Bowdoin as a transfer. I know a bunch of sophomore transfers who did it and loved it, but I imagine it'd be tough as a junior when most of your class year is abroad one semester (or both). You'd likely be living on the top floor of a freshman dorm (West/Osher) or in a single in a building called Chambo\u2014not great social spaces on campus. \n\nI'm sure the cross country team would be a great support system so maybe you wouldn't need to worry about the social stuff. Just my two cents.",

I think I'll still apply since I don't have much to lose, but I'll also consider some less competitive liberal arts schools. And yeah I'd like to be on a team wherever I go for the social opportunity.",

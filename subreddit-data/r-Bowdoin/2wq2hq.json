    "postText": "Hi, everyone!\n\nMy dad, aunt, and uncle attended Bowdoin and they all LOVED it... I was on campus today for the hockey game against Tufts and I was glad to see that we kicked ass. While I was on campus, I began to think about Bowdoin as a potential college choice in the coming years, but with a puny acceptance rate, I'm a tad bit nervous. I make decent grades (Honor roll, A's and B's at a private school), but I really stand out in my extracurriculars (Theatre, tennis, Model UN, etc).\n\nI would KILL to attend one day, but as I'm a white girl from New Hampshire, I feel that I would not be adding much diversity to my class, even WITH legacy status.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering how much legacy would help my cause should I choose to apply. Would it be worth it? How much of an advantage is it to have this on your application? \n\nThanks!",

Not sure there's any real quantifiable way to measure how much it helps (can't imagine bowdoin would ever admit how much of a factor it is), but it helps. And as for applying, who gives a shit if you don't seem like the PERFECT candidate. I'm a white dude from NY, didn't think I'd get in by said fuck it. And I got in. And it was an even better experience than I had expected. Start working harder in class and get yourself admitted. It'll be worth it. ",

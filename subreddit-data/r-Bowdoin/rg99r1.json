How helpful were professors? How stressful is it? Is it more competitive or cooperative?",

            "comment": "Not a POC, went to Bowdoin and studied Math and CS, was considering an engineering program when looking at undergrad programs, and looked into the 3+2 at Bowdoin. Now work as a kind of SWE on investment algos. Once I got to Bowdoin I never seriously considered the 3+2 program, I did not want to leave for my senior year, especially because I played soccer. I figured if I really wanted to do the engineering masters I could just do it afterwards.\n\nAs far as I know, very few people actually do the engineering programs. In general I thought the Bowdoin Physics department (who I think effectively run the program and where most of the requirements for it are) was very good, particularly Baumgarte and Naculich. I took 3-4 physics courses while there and wish I took a couple more. I found the department to be friendly, and the students to be very nice, friendly, bright people. The first couple of courses that are required for pre med are a drag, but you can place out of at least one of them with AP Physics.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions I might be able to help with.",

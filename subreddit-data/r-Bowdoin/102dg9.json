    "postText": "Hello. I'm running for class of 2013 president. Here's a little bit about me for you to know off the bat. I've been involved on our campus in quite a few different ways over the past three years as a member of the Judicial Board, one of the leaders of BMASV, a thrower on the Track &amp; Field team, and worker in the library. I\u2019ve also worked Senior Week the past two year and have a few great ideas for this coming year as well.  Feel free to ask me anything about myself or the election.\n",

Sam Roberts '14 reporting in.\n\nFirst big question that comes to mind is: What powers / responsibilities / affect on the students does a Senior Class President have?  What changes can a SCP enact?  Can you relate a few significant actions from previous SCPs that would help to illuminate the role?\n\n2nd: How would you fit into these powers/responsibilities?  What would set you apart from previous SCPs (do you agree/disagree with the aforementioned examples from your predecessors)?  What would you *do*?  \n\n3rd: What are your great ideas for the upcoming Senior Week?  Not that they would affect me, just curious.  Also, it would be good for any other Senior on this subreddit to see.  \n\n4th, your choice: fight 100 duck-sized Randy Nichols, or 1 Randy Nichols-sized duck.  \n\n5th: Moulton or Thorne?\n\n6th:  Favorite social house?  (only one right answer, buddy XD)\n\n7th:  Greatest party story / drinking achievement.  I cannot stress how important this question is.  ",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the questions Sam.  I'll go point by point here:\n\n1.\tThe Senior Class President is primarily responsible for creating, organizing, and running senior class events, but is also a member of the \"leadership Council\" which is comprised of a few class council members from each year to foster unity and guidance among the different years.  Some significant actions from previous Senior Class Presidents include coordinating with Brunswick establishments (mostly bars, but I plan to expand that) for 'Senior Specials,' a huge, and free to enter, poker night in Moulton, the class gift, and the big one is Senior Week.\n2.\tI love this question.  I think I fit well into the mold and formula that has been used in the past (such as organize one or two big events during the year, focus on class gift and senior week), but at the same time I think I bring a little bit of an unconventional approach to the position.  Whereas Josh Kim (last year\u2019s SCP) had a lot of sporadic energy and enthusiasm, I think of myself as a very approachable person who has a more focused energy geared towards taking ideas and initiatives and converting them into real exciting events. For example, I am really excited to start talking with The Frontier, bowling alley, and other restaurants downtown to find some less formal, still relaxing and fun atmospheres for seniors to hang out close to campus.\n3.\tWorking Senior Week the past two years has been an absolute blast, but I am inclined to remove a few events \u2013 particularly paintballing, rafting, and the booze cruise \u2013 because they are historically very expensive, and poorly attended because the first two require seniors to get up before 6am, which is ridiculous, and the Booze cruise is normally right before the Portland Pub Crawl\u2026and that is just a marathon when most people have been training for the sprints.  Before committing to filling those time slots with anything else, I absolutely want to hear what everyone else is interested in/wants to happen their last week at Bowdoin. \n4.\tI\u2019m going to fight that Randy sized duck.  I feel like as long as I play to my strengths (real hands and feet, mobile on land, lateral quickness) and take advantage of the unstable webbed feet and lack of fists/teeth that battle should be a cakewalk.\n5.\tI\u2019m a Thorne guy. The high ceilings and open serving area with lots of natural lighting is just a relaxing environment for me.\n6.\tMy favorite Social House has got tobe Helmreich.  Some of my best friends lived there last year (Matt Ramos, Chris Martin, Jay Greene, Paulina Borrego, Shelagh Merrill) and I have been an honorary house member ever since. Not too mention the brand new speakers and TV this year.\n7.\tMy greatest party story has got to be the whole Track Pig Roast.  We put the pig on a spit at 2am, and just hung out/drank all day until it was ready to eat at 6pm.  It was awesome, and there is nothing quite like chilling out on the Brunswick Quad all day with a bunch of fun guys and girls.\n\nThanks for the questions, they were a lot of fun for me to answer, hopefully they gave you a better picture of me.\n",

Why do you think you are more qualified than Melody for this position,  despite her excellent record of events over freshman and sophomore years?\n3. What ideas for events do you have for senior events outside of senior week?\n\nThanks.",

                    "comment": "Hello Fellow Bowdoin Senior,\n\n1. I want to be class president because I want to be directly involved with making sure our senior year is fun and memorable.  \n2. Great question, well...as a member of the Judicial Board, leader of BMASV, student worker in H&amp;L, Undiscussed facilitator, sports information student assistant, and intramural sports official I've gathered about as diverse a work portfolio as you can gather at Bowdoin.  I've done everything from plan events, to organize volunteers, to schedule speakers, to run discussion panels.  That all sounds great, and is definitely integral to running a class council, but I think I set myself apart by being friendly, social, and can relate to different people and their interests.  So, hopefully you feel that I have the experience to lead our class this year and have the approachable personality necessary for making a senior year that everyone can enjoy.\n3. Specifically, the events I have in mind are a gallery viewing at the Frontier, some kind of bowling night, a poker night - which was a huge success last year, the traditional senior nights at bars downtown, at least two trips per semester to Portland for a barcrawl, campfire/movie on quad, and of course the junior senior ball and any ideas you classmates think will be awesome.\n\nThanks for the Qs.\n",

I think both you and I agree that is simply not true.\n\nDo you have any plans for incentivizing students to support local businesses or even just go into town more? I'm sure I am not the only student who feels we could be closer to the town. \n\nThanks",

                    "comment": "Yeah, sometimes I think that the script given to tour guides is not particularly accurate, even though it sounds great to parents and potential students. \n\nAnyway, to answer your question, one of the first things that I plan on doing after the election is making class council sessions both open and accessible to seniors so that we can hear what aspects of Brunswick's options appeal to you, so that we (as the Class Council) can go talk to those business's about having specials, or senior nights, or any sort of collaboration that would entice both the business owners and students.  \n\nOverall, I am definitely a proponent of getting off campus a little more, especially if it is for something like great dinner deals at Shere Punjab or 2$ beers at Sea Dogs.\n\nGreat thought, thanks for that question.",

    "postText": "I'm interested in Bowdoin and have some questions: \n\n1. How does the size of the school influence the social scene? Does it ever feel too small? \n2. What is the personality (vibe) of the school like? Is there a lot of school spirit? Is it super artsy/activisty? \n3. Are students nice to each other? \n4. Is there a competitive atmosphere? \n\nAnswering any or all of these questions would be super helpful!",

            "comment": "My experience is even more dated than the first respondent (class of '07), but here goes. \n\n1. While I'm sure the small size does influence the scene, I never considered it a bad thing. I liked knowing most of my classmates, and it never go to the point where I became bored/knew too much about those around me. \n2. I loved the vibe. There was a lot of school spirit (especially at mens hockey games), but not to a weird/culty level. Lots of focus on outdoorsy stuff, not ultra artsy. \n3. It was a very friendly, encouraging environment. My wife went to Hamilton College, so I've talked a lot with her about how our experiences compared. The impression I get is, the kids at Bowdoin are just really wholesome, at least relative to the Hamilton kids. \n4. I actually did find the environment competitive, but not in a bad way. I'd coasted through HS without putting a TON of work in, and freshman year was a wakeup call for me. The folks I lived around (Coleman was my freshman dorm) all pushed one another academically, which was inspiring for me. I felt compelled to work harder and put more time in, and 12 years later I'm still grateful. \n\nBottom line on Bowdoin: It was the perfect college for me. I'd always thought of college being a small, old school. Walking through a snowy quad, classrooms with fireplaces where professors call you by your first name. Drinking and smoking into the wee hours and having all the pompous intellectual discussions you dreamt about as a high schooler. Bowdoin gave me that, along with a group of friends I still hold dear today. Men and women who have gone on to achieve amazing things, people I'm proud to have been classmates with and to consider friends now. If you get in, GO.",

            "comment": "Be aware that approximately 50% of the student body at Bowdoin are  recruited athletes and very, very bright. \n\nI think this is important because athletes can create huge cliques and rule the social scene. If you are an athlete it\u2019s great, but for others it can be intimidating. Talk to lots of students about this when you visit the campus \u2014 they have direct experience and can give you the best advice. \n\nAll NESCAC schools are D3 and many compete fiercely for the same athletes. There are 11 colleges in the conference ( Williams, Amherst, Midd, Tufts, Colby, etc. ) Bates and Bowdoin are SAT optional. A large percentage of the student body are from private schools and many of those kids are paying full boat. So, the student body tends to feel polarized... very rich and the very poor on full rides. Athletes and the rich kids create an interesting vibe that you won\u2019t feel as much at larger schools but if you fit in, you should enjoy your 4 years immensely.",

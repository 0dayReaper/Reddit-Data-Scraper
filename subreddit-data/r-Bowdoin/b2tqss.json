    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI was admitted to Bowdoin a few days ago and am excited to potentially attend, but I have a few academic concerns.\n\nI was browsing through ratemyprofessor's website in order to see how well or poorly the professors in STEM fields were regarded. I mainly stumbled upon extremely old ratings of professors that do not teach here anymore. I do plan on doing pre-med and major in Chemistry, so I was wondering about what everyone's perceptions on this department's current faculty members(or STEM in general is)?\n\nA few more questions:\n\n1. How large are intro science classes? Such as Physics, Bio, Gen Chem, etc.\n2. Are STEM majors a minority at Bowdoin?\n3. Is there flexibility in choosing professors? The course catalog shows a few teachers teaching Intro Chem/Bio classes, so I am worried about the class-sizes for intro courses and the inability to switch professors if one happens to be bad or highly irrational.\n\nThanks everyone. I will also be visiting Bowdoin for Open House Day (if anyone (STEM major or not) would be willing to talk to me one-on-one - I'd greatly appreciate that).",

Several of my classmates are now professors in their field and others have gone on to private industry or became doctors including a couple MD/PhDs.\n\nBowdoin is fantastic for STEM.\n\nAs far as flexibility in choosing profs it is limited just because of the relatively small size but I didn\u2019t have a bad professor anywhere in STEM the whole time I was there. If you want to go into a biochem related field Bowdoin is top notch especially if you want to do an honors project or summer research or both (I *highly* recommend a summer project).\n\nGood luck and hope we can count you as an alumnus soon.\n\nPM me if you have any more questions.",

I\u2019m glad you found bowdoin! \n\nIn my experience, STEM at bowdoin has a great reputation\u2014ratemyprof isn\u2019t very popular here because i think we tend to go by word of mouth and there\u2019s also an internal system we use. Since bowdoin is a LAC, you\u2019re encouraged to take classes in all sorts of departments when you\u2019re starting off, meaning that just about everyone has taken at least one stem class. On the flip side, bowdoin isn\u2019t your large research institution, but the resources on campus are dedicated to only undergrads and the biggest priority of professors is to teaching. STEM majors are definitely not a minority here. Computer Science and bio are in the top 5 most popular, and chem and phys are in the top 10. \n\nIn terms of size, intro classes tend to be bigger, like 30-40 people for lecture, and you also have a lab, which is a 3-4hr block once per week that is run by a separate professor. Labs are smaller, maybe ~10 people, and there are usually a few options for times. Speaking of times, yes, you have options, and you can build your schedule so you only have classes past 10am or only one class on fridays etc.\n\nEg, Sounds like you\u2019re interested in chem? If you place out of intro with AP scores, you\u2019d go into orgo, which had three sections this past semester: 3 different professors and times. \n\nOverall, I think stem at bowdoin is quite similar to other LACs, especially the NESCACs, but bowdoin\u2018s costal location does let us have opportunities for marine bio if you\u2019re into that sort of study. \n\nIf you have any other questions or want to chat when you visit, pm me! Good luck \ud83d\udc4d ",

            "comment": "Hi, current Bowdoin student here!\n\nAs others have mentioned, ratemyprofessor is not very popular here. I haven't taken any chemistry classes, but I've heard mostly positive things about the department. The biology and neuroscience programs are pretty popular, and environmental stuff is expanding if you're interested in that.\n\n1. Bio, EOS, and Chem tend to have large (30-50) intro lectures with smaller lab sections, but my largest physics course was ~30 people.\n\n2. I would say that it might be a minority as a whole, but Bio and Chem are among the most popular individual majors (at least among people I know).\n\n3. For math and some chem/bio courses (up through organic chemistry) there is definitely some flexibility. Often professors won't teach the same class multiple semesters in a row, so you can always wait for a professor you like better to teach it in the future. In other departments there is a little less flexibility, same for higher level courses.\n\nGood luck!",

If you haven't, PM your phone number and I can add you. Also I can give you proof that I'm not a stalker lmao",

I am afraid they would accept only one student from each country ( mine , tunisia , is really small-10 million citizens) .\nI am thinking about changig ti regular and applying ed2 to davidson ( applied rd can change plans till 15th) and if necessary withdrawig my app ...\nIs that a good idea ?? Knowing that I had a REALLY good interview with an alumna ?? \n\nThank you!",

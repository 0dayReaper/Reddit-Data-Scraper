I\u2019m sorry about ur situation, it will get better with time (u getting off of Bowdoin\u2019s WL, going to another college, taking a gap year and reapplying) because any step u take will allow u become independent enough to separate urself eventually from ur abusive family. Did u send Bowdoin an LOCI?",

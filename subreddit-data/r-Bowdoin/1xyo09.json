I want to know if i'll be able to get in and have a possibility of getting a scholarship. I got a 201 on my PSAT this year, have a 3.8 GPA, play lacrosse, and am a boy scout (if that helps).",

            "comment": "Hi there! First off, as you've no doubt already learned, Bowdoin is very selective. As such, it's difficult to say whether or not you will get in. Lots of bright, qualified kids get turned away.\n\nWhat grade are you in currently? Your GPA is good, have you been taking challenging classes as well? Your PSAT isn't bad either, but if you do choose to submit SAT/ACT (we're test optional) you may want to aim a bit higher--2100+ would be a good goal. \n\nPast that, just keep doing the things you're interested in. Seek leadership roles where possible. Public service is a key element of Bowdoin's philosophy, so if you can demonstrate a commitment to others that really helps.\n\nFinally on financial aid, Bowdoin is completely need-based. The good news is that the school has a huge endowment and gives very generous aid money. Everybody who needs financial aid will get it, depending on the family's level of income, etc.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to ask questions!",

In general the nescac tends to be one of if not the most competitive D3 conferences, so I'd assume it's a strong team. \n\nI think you're doing fine for a sophomore. Keep up your grades, maybe talk to the lax coach next year. You could have a good shot at getting in. ",

Whatever is unique about you, whatever you have a passion about, search it out in your community and in your school. Get involved and Bowdoin will notice. \n\nMake sure you do an interview when the time comes, it can only help you!\n\nGood luck, though I can't give any perspective as a Bowdoin student yet, feel free to ask questions about the application process!",

            "comment": "Hi, current student here. From what you've described, you definitely seem to be on track. Keep your grades up, take as many APs as you can without sacrificing quality, and reassess this time next year. Also, if you feel borderline about your chances at Bowdoin, you might want to look into also applying to other schools with similar profiles (Middelbury, Haverford, etc) in order to maximize your chances of getting in to one. SATs are not officially required, but if you do well on them and submit your score it can be a major advantage. Feel free to Inbox me if you'd like more information. ",

However I am quite concerned about getting in and how well it will prepare me for the future. I plan to major in biology and environmental science, and the sciences seemed pretty solid, but I was wondering how successful people coming out of bowdoin are in these majors in terms of getting good jobs/into grad school. Also, any advice for applying? I currently have 4.2 out of 4.6 and 2050 (am retaking) and very involved leader/athlete/researcher/club member. Besides Bowdoin, I've been looking into Tufts, Bates, Amherst, Colgate, Midd, ect, and liked Bates the most (by quite a bit), followed by Amherst. Should I apply early decision/will it increase my chances of getting in?\nEdit: I meant that I like Bowdoin the most, not bates",

You shouldn't be worrying about preparing for post-college, focus on your senior year and college applications and then have a blast wherever you end up. As for getting into Bowdoin, early decision is certainly the way to go if you're certain this is where you want to go. At the very least you won't make it for early decision and then have a second chance during regular admission, at best you will find out in January and not have to worry about getting into college for the spring semester while the rest of your peers are stressing about it!",

Really all NESCAC schools are going to give you a great experience, but Bowdoin is unique. When your class is 10 other kids who are SUPER passionate, and a professor who is Ivy quality but actually teaches the classes instead of using a TA, you tend to get a pretty kick ass education. Don't discount how important that small classes/high professorial engagement is; by my junior year I was house-sitting for professors. It is awesome. \n\nJust attended a wedding last weekend, two of my classmates finally getting hitched. Of all the polar bears in attendance, there wasn't a single one who wasn't kicking ASS in their professional life. You enter a network of people who will valuable personally and professionally for the rest of your life. Don't second guess it - just go and have fun. ",

But I did alumni interviews for Bowdoin and can give you a little perspective on what they like (it isn't anything you probably haven't heard before if you did a little research).\n\nAdmissions likes seeing people that are specifically passionate about going to Bowdoin. Knowing about the school, taking time to do an interview (whether on campus or an alumni interview in your home town), and generally being able to express why you want to go to *Bowdoin* as opposed to other, similar choices.\n\nThey also really like seeing *long term* dedication to leadership/athletics/research/club membership. You see lots of students with good grades and test scores who did a short stint at some volunteer places or in a club without anything that shows consistent dedication beyond other students.\n\nSo play to the things you are most proud of, that you have been involved in the longest, and anything that is interesting or different that will set you apart.\n\nBio at Bowdoin is fantastic. I was Biochem and had an amazing experience. It was pretty easy for me to find bio jobs after school and lots of folks I went to school with have gone on to PhDs/Masters and are doing very well.\n\nI always suggest against the \"softer\" side of bio. I think it is better to focus more on molecular bio, chemistry (although I was shit at chemistry, especially orgo), and genetics. I think that focusing on those types of classes gives you a very good grasp of some very fundamental biology that ends up being very useful in any bio field and can help you land many other jobs if you decide you don't want to go the PhD/Masters route.\n\nI think Bowdoin has a very good track record for getting folks in graduate programs, not in the least because you have a HUGELY dedicated group of professors at Bowdoin and I think specifically in the sciences and particularly in the bio sciences. I was a published author before I left Bowdoin! One of my lab mates got on two papers.\n\nI would definitely recommend staying over a summer and doing research with a professor if you want to get a good resume for postgraduate work. (or do summer research in a lab elsewhere).\n\nThis sub is kind of dead/small so I hope I was helpful.",

I've only been here for a few weeks now, but I have noticed that it's somewhat inherent to the system. For example, there are mixers between sports, but not between athletes and non-athletes. \n\nIt's not THAT bad, though. And some sports are less cultish than others. In the end, you can still find whatever youre looking for socially.",

Another class got an assignment back and no one asked anyone how they did or what they got for x answer. We took our grade and knew that it meant we had room to improve. I think that\u2019s uniquely Bowdoin.",

People help each other with assignments and professors encourage it as long as you name who you collaborate with.",

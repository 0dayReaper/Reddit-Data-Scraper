I have come across several posts talking about social houses and were wonder what they were? Are they like frats and sororities or are they something else? And does everyone participate in them? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Bowdoin abolished greek life in 2000 and the school bought several of the old frat houses to use as co-ed dorms for (usually) sophomores. They function similarly to frats in the sense that they throw big parties, but these parties are usually open to anyone on campus and are especially popular with first years and sophomores. The houses also sponsor a bunch of other activities and events, and each one is affiliated with a first year dorm. You apply to live there the year before. I graduated a few years ago so things may have changed, but living in a college house was so much fun and I'm still close friends with several of my housemates.\n\nI believe some of the houses have social media accounts, if you want a sense of the vibe. You can find the houses' names on the Bowdoin website.",

It is nice to have a big indoor space that is private too.",

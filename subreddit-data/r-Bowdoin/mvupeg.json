    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI was admitted to Bowdoin's class of 2025 in March! Though I'm super excited to have the opportunity to attend Bowdoin, I hold some reservations when comparing it to my other options. I was wondering what the outcomes are of a computer science, math, or neuroscience degree from Bowdoin.  Where do students go off to? This could be in terms of career or grad school placement. I've heard great things about Bowdoin's alumni network and outcomes, just want to hear some testimonies. Thanks for your help!",

            "comment": "I was a CS/math double major. Most of my CS friends went straight into software dev at a variety of companies (generally FAANG and/or startups, as well as some mid-sized companies that target Bowdoin grads) after graduating. A lot of people at Bowdoin use math as a complementary major, myself included. Of those who primarily focused on math, several are now in graduate programs or various data science positions. A couple people decided to branch out and get a fellowship to teach English or work at an NGO before they decided where they\u2019d like to go next.\n\nI didn\u2019t know as many neuro people, a couple were interested in med school and others just really enjoyed the neuro classes. I\u2019m sure others can give you a better perspective there",

Sometimes they don\u2019t even care if the degree is in CS, as long as you have plenty of programming experience (internships help here a bunch).\n\nI had friends go to Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Stripe, etc. all with BAs in CS from Bowdoin. There are also a few smaller tech companies that are Bowdoin/NESCAC grad heavy",

This was my first choice but I'm afraid employers won't know what the major actually is. I was also thinking of double majoring in comp sci + digital and Computational Studies to get the general education + something that especially intrigues and interests me the most.",

However, I did take a couple of classes in the department and enjoyed them.\n\nGenerally, tech companies care more about programming competency than they do your specific major. That said, computer science is definitely a more common/recognizable major compared to DCS. A double major wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea.\n\nBowdoin doesn\u2019t ask you to declare your major(s) until the end of your sophomore year. Until then, everyone is essentially undecided. So my advice would be to start with DCS and CS as your intended majors, and then re-evaluate after taking a couple of classes in both departments. You might lean towards one in particular or decide that you\u2019d like to use your second major on a completely unrelated subject",

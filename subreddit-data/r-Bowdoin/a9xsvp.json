    "postText": "I couldn\u2019t make my mind up after thinking about it for so long. I got a 1340 (650 R&amp;W and 690 M), which may make it seem like I definitely shouldn\u2019t send it since it\u2019s on the low end. \n\nHowever, my math grades throughout high school weren\u2019t great, and my ranking is terrible. I did decently in English, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t improve my R&amp;W score. I know my chances for Bowdoin were slim in the first place, but I\u2019ll still try to make the best of what I have right now. \n\nBasically, would it just be better to send the SAT score even though it\u2019s on the lower end since my math scores and ranking are even worse? Or should I just keep it out? Any feedback would be appreciated! ",

Extracurrics were \u2026 a lot. Theater (community and school - acting, stage managing, properties), NHS, Beta Club, Diversity Club (VP), Y-Club (president), and Yearbook. Oh and dance (jazz, tap). Honestly though, the letters of rec and your essays are a HUGE part of the admissions decision. And, of course, knowing someone is sometimes helpful.",

I only put down three clubs I was in at school, but I was in all of them for at least two years. One was for two years, another was for three, and one is for all four. \n\nAnd so should I send my SAT score then? Sorry for the repetitive question haha, but would it be better if I showed them my math skills aren\u2019t as bad as they think from my transcript? ",

            "comment": "I second what /u/lacrimaeveneris said. it looks like the average SAT score for students attending Bowdoin was a 1390. You\u2019re close enough that I think including it wouldn\u2019t hurt your chances too much. However, if I remember correctly, about 10-20% of students don\u2019t submit their test scores, so you wouldn\u2019t be the only one if you decided to not submit it.\n\nThere\u2019s much more to the application than just the SAT score. Many of my friends got in the range of 1300s-1400s. I think that with a 1340, it won\u2019t really make or break your application. If you\u2019ve got a strong application in other areas (3 of: a good GPA, letters of recommendation, extracurriculars, and good essays), then your SAT score at 1340 won\u2019t be the deciding factor. It will be good enough for admissions to check a box, but not enough for them to admit you on it alone.",

Does that make sense? \n\nCongratulations on your acceptance and that SAT score! And it\u2019s good to hear others close to my score get in. Do you know if they did anything special or if they submitted the score?\n\nThe whole thing is just discouraging somethings because on College Confidential (yeah I should stop going on there), I see many accomplished, amazing students get denied/waitlisted/deferred from Bowdoin. \n\nSadly, while my recs, extracurriculars, and essays are decent in my eyes (hard to tell), my GPA isn\u2019t too great. Although in the mass majority of my classes I did alright in (high 80s and in the 90s), there were three honors classes I unfortunately got 70s in that sank the whole thing down. But oh well! I can only hope for the best now. \n\nAnd so should I send my SAT score then? Sorry for the repetitive question haha, but would it be better if I showed them my math skills aren\u2019t as bad as they think from my transcript? ",

                            "comment": "Yeah, I think I follow your reasoning there. It makes sense. If I were in your shoes I would probably submit it, but I think it honestly won\u2019t have much of an impact either way. If you got in the 1200s or a 1550+, it would definitely hurt or help your application. A mid-1300s score won\u2019t make or break your application. Ultimately it\u2019s your decision whether or not to submit it, don\u2019t just submit it because I think I would.\n\nI mean, everyone has something on their application that makes them stand out. For some, it\u2019s a high GPA and test scores. For others, it\u2019s good extracurriculars and being an excellent person (reflected in their letters of recommendation). Or it could be something completely different. A lot of fantastic candidates are rejected, and a lot of them are accepted. I believe it was Stanford who said that they believe about 80% of their applicants would succeed there, but they can only accept 5-10% of them. Bowdoin probably has a similar belief. There are just a lot of good candidates out there. \n\nAs far as I know, most of my friends submitted SAT/ACT scores. But honestly, we don\u2019t really discuss it too much. I know my freshman roommate didn\u2019t, and he instead was a person with a pretty unique background and wide-ranging interests which made him a good fit for Bowdoin.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend college confidential, just because I think it\u2019s more stressful than it\u2019s worth. Although it was several years ago, I didn\u2019t learn anything useful on that site other than how to worry about college. You seem like a pretty smart person who cares about school, wherever you\u2019ll get in you\u2019ll do fine. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get in somewhere good. Best of luck!",

I\u2019ve already gotten into my safety at Rutgers, but I still prefer small schools. \n\nHopefully I\u2019ll make it through, and thanks again! And I\u2019m still debating if I should do the optional video response for Bowdoin, but I\u2019m too nervous about how I look and what I\u2019m gonna say. I didn\u2019t do the interview because I decided to apply too late, so I think doing the video is a good idea, but I\u2019m just nervous about it lol. ",

    "postText": "So the administration is on strike, so no official mid year report,and I emailed the AOs and they told me my coubselor can send unofficial grades \"when it is convenient\" so should I tell him to send those ? \nMaths : 14.75/20 A ( 2nd grade in group)\nphysics 16/20 A+\nScience 17/20 A+( 2nd grade in group)\nEnglish 16/20 A+ ( 1st grade in group)\nPhilosophy: 12 ( 2nd grade in group)\n\nHe will send them in this format, and these are only my mid term tests. Should he change the format? Are the ranking thing exagerated? ( due to covid, we study on groups of 15 that's why my ranking is good) I havent sent any scores or aps so I feel they would get the sense I am not rigorous enough.should he add something to add on my progression since they mentionned they accept \"progress comments\" ?\n\n\nThank you!",

But since your grades are so solid, u should email the admissions and ask them if they could move u to the RD round for better evaluation. Don\u2019t take my words tho, I\u2019m just an ED2 applicant like you, so just giving my unprofessional advice here. Hope it helps.",

    "postText": "My Father in law is always going on about being a family, working as a team, blah blah blah...but whenever we need his help he can't do it.\n\nToday I'm on crutches. I need help getting my son to school as I usually walk him up the street. You can literally see his school from our yard. My bf before leaving for work asked his father if he could at least help me load my son into the car. Nope. He gave the old \"i can't move\" speech. That's ok, as he always needs help every day my bf is gonna tell him the same thing.\nHowever I'm pissed so I'm taking it farther.  If you read my posts about FIL he deserves every bit of this. \nSo I happen to be blessed with a very foul digestive tract. I was on the mid floor and was presented with an opportunity. I have to shit and either i can go upstairs, or downstairs. The basement is FIL's living room/man cave. I've decided to go down stairs. There's no ventilation at all and the wooden walls soak up the smell. I once had to use it while he was in the shower and the smell lasted a week even with spraying. This time I'm not even flushing.\nFuck him!\nHere's something to remind you of your shitty personality FIL!\n\n\nUPDATE: I know some of you will say I have no follow through or that I'm chicken. I changed my mind because 2 wrongs don't make a right and I don't need a fight. Well my MIL stopped by(she doesn't live with us) and I was about to go down stairs and clean it up...when she asked what I was getting up to do I explained honestly. She then offered to go take care of it as she had to go down and grab something anyway. Well FIL overheard us...and though it was all cleaned up, the man who \"can't move\" suddenly leaped outta bed running down and up the stairs yelled and shouted at me. I didn't answer him because I didn't want to make things worse. \nNow I feel bad not for myself but the stress this is all causing my bf... he's already called to yell at my bf while he's at work.... poor guy's got enough on his plate right now. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid when I changed my mind...so much for that. Now part of me feels like I should've left it as it was if I  as gonna was gonna get the same outcome. But I know I had to be the bigger person...damn...what a shitty situation...\n\n----Don't read past here if you don't like gross-------\n\nOh it was glorious! \nFull on diarrhea! Sprayed the whole bowl! \nI closed that door where it will ferment until he wakes up for the day and goes down stairs!\nHe likes to sleep in btw....lol",

Talk with your husband and tell him you\u2019re sick of his abuse of you both in your own home when your helping him out. Tell him you think it\u2019s time you both need to stop enabling FIL and he needs to tell him neither of you are his servant and will ot help anymore. That they only person at fault is him for treating you both so badly.\n\nSave save all that you can\u2019t to move out If it\u2019s your home then set a date you will allow him to stay there till that should let him find somewhere else, he will, be out by that date regardless.\n\nI kept going back to caring for my disabled parents as I thought I couldn\u2019t live with the guilt. They never cared I was becoming more disabled and caring for them was taking away what I could do for my own family. When they crossed a line and I left to my surprise I didn\u2019t feel guilty at all, they brought this on themselves and  they refused outside carers, their choice not mine.   \nWhat I actually did feel when I walked away is realising I should have walked years before and not doing that only allowed them to cause years more damage to me. Family does not mean being treated like crap and having no choice. He\u2019s an adult and makes his own bed to lie in and face the consequences.",

When we moved here i was pregnant with my son, working full time, paying $800 while my bf scrambled to find a job with a livable wage. (He used to do side gigs and lived with his Dad but soon as surprise baby he stepped up) I paid the deposit and FIL pays $400 a month. Once my bf got into a FT job he paid his portion. When i went on maternity leave he has paid my portion. We can't afford daycare and with my son's autism i need to stay home with him . So 3 yrs later bf is paying my share until our son goes to school FT. Then I'll be able to get a job while he's at school.",

There are grants, disability to help with the higher costs of having to take care of children who have it. There are also clubs and activities aimed for children on the spectrum and paid for by the government to help them learn to socialise and give the parents a break. As well as I think it\u2019s called family fund which you apply to yearly and they pay for a family holiday accommodation and some towards other cost of it, at least once a year. Citizens advise as well as social services can tell you what\u2019s available and sign you up for these things.",

Anyone here will tell you unless you're physically missing a limb you'll be denied disability 3 times before being accepted. Sometimes even then they still give ya the run around.

Yes it\u2019s frustrating and can be upsetting but it gets you help you\u2019re entitled to. I\u2019ve had to do just this for myself (disabled) and then my anxiety controlled ND and ADHD son. Yes it does takes years to be diagnosed if they aren\u2019t already but the other help and grants are nothing like that wait, In the UK anyway. It comes down to if the parent contacts all the right people and pushes they will get it rather then the ones who just say it\u2019s too hard and don\u2019t even try. My son has just been assessed for adhd and Asperger\u2019s but we still applied for and we\u2019re awarded benefits long before he\u2019s been diagnosed. We let them know we were awaiting diagnosis but that every medical professional/psychologist and psychiatrist as well as CAMHS nurses all say he is and have treated him as such right from the start years before. Providing their letters from each visit proved it all to them. So it is possible, took us 6 months from applying to him being awarded disability. Even when they become adults you are sent new forms and dealt with faster as its not your fault age meant you have to go on a different system. They try to ensure the drop in money is temporary until they new people evaluate your child. My youngest is now 17 and got it first time. \n\nThe whole system is messed up but you wont get help you need unless you try.   \nSomething I\u2019ve not done but a friend did was contact social services/cps about what\u2019s available to help kids on the spectrum. They provided her different free activity clubs held weekly to give the parent a rest and help your child interact with others. They also are sent out forms every year to apply for a holiday grant. It basically pays for the accommodation for the whole family for a week or you can go on a shorter stay and let it also pay other holiday expenses. Don\u2019t get me wrong it is not lavish holidays just basic but it helps.",

He's going to school early so that he can be caught up by the time he's of \"normal age\" to start school. \nIt's done so much for him. He was completely non-verbal but now since Christmas he's talking!\nStill working on potty training. He's on the largest size pull ups so i told him if he doesn't learn soon I'll have to put him in depends lol\nHe has made progress. Pooed and peed a few times in the potty. Unfortunately by the time he tells me he has to go, 75% chance he already went. An hour after eating i sit him on the potty and he'll try but won't go. Soon as I get him off, he poops.(facepalm) motherhood right?",

    "postText": "Seriously. 4 years ago, I'm cashiering at a whacky mart on a register that holds all the smokes and alcohol. It's 10pm and these two young men (early 20s) come up to the counter. They have three random novelty items (I don't remember they were), but it was strange and unusual to get odd items this late at night. Maybe it was for some fraternity, I don't know. It's a college town so I get weird stuff from frats a lot. I scan the items and tell them their total is $22.xx.\n\nGrinning at each other, they reach into their jackets and slam down two gallon zip-lock bags, full of only pennies. I stare them in the eye, but they didn't even look back at me. Everyone else in line groan and went to other registers. These two kids knew what they were doing, but they didn't know what they were in for because I prepared for this; I knew this was going to inevitably happen. I grinned with them, because I was gonna get paid during this. These pranksters are here for recreation. This convo occurs between Me, Ringleader (the other guy was silent and awkward), and a friendly coworker of mine.\n\n&gt;Me: Is this $22.xx?\n\n&gt;Ringleader: ...\n\n&gt;Me: Did you count it?\n\n&gt;Ringleader: Nope.\n\n&gt;Me: Are you going to? \n\n&gt;Ringleader: Nope.\n\n&gt;Me: Is it at least $22.xx?\n\n&gt;Ringleader: Don't know.\n\n&gt;Me: Nice.\n\n&gt;Coworker: Hey! You guys can use the self checkout. It can take all of your coins at once.\n\n&gt;Me: Oh, don't worry about it Cowor--\n\n&gt;Ringleader: Nope, don't trust them lady.  (Partner laughs)\n\n&gt;Coworker: What? Why!?\n\n&gt;Ringleader: Doesn't count all your change right.\n\n&gt;Coworker: I've used them before. It really works!\n\n&gt;Me: (to Coworker) I got this.\n\nI unpacked the ziplocks and threw all the pennies on the counter. It was a beautiful, massive shitstorm of a mess. And I digged in it. I was Frank in a dumpster in 'It's Always Sunny'. The two, still averting my gaze, start chuckling as if they were taking away my dignity. They whisper to each other \"Dude oh my God,\" \"Dude yeah,\" \"Dude, hilarious.\"  I counted each penny, one by one. My coworker comes up to me.\n\n&gt;Coworker: Guess I'll help you count this.\n\n&gt;Me: Don't worry about it.\n\n&gt;(She looks at me confused. Then she puts on her 'get down to busy' look.)\n\n&gt;Coworker: I got your back.\n\n&gt;Me: *Oh...*ok.\n\n\nWe worked up a system where we counted ten, put them in a pile, then with ten stacks of ten pennies we separated them, making $1 piles. We made progress slowly but surely. Some customers came to the line, but we advised them to get to another line. Some of them looked at us confused, but when they saw the counter full of pennies they understood. Some decided to wait, but when they realized it wasn't going to take just a few minutes they took their leave. Another register in the liquor department opened so it wasn't too bad for other customers. We get to about $12 (about 10min in) until I \"knocked\" over the piles.\n\n&gt;Coworker: Neontonsil!\n\n&gt;Me: Oops. Sorry.\n\n&gt;(Coworker looks at my grin. I give her a wink and tilt my head, motioning her to leave)\n\n&gt;Coworker: You know what, I think I better let you do this.\n\n&gt;Me: Ha, alright.\n\n&gt;(Coworker leaves. I look at the two guys. They are absolutely stunned at the fallen piles of pennies.)\n\n&gt;Me: (To Ringleader) Yeah, I'm going to have to count all of this again.\n\n&gt;Ringleader: ....Ok.\n\nI started from zero. I count slower then ever, and made my way back up. The duo is entirely silent. I get to about $7, when suddenly I say:\n\n&gt;Me: Drats. I lost count. I better start all over again.\n\n&gt;Ringleader: Really? \n\n&gt;Me: Oh yeah man. \n\n&gt;Ringleader: Why!?\n\n&gt;Me: I lost count, sir. I could be in trouble if my register doesn't have the right amount of cash, and I don't want to rip you off. \n\n&gt;Ringleader: ...\n\nIt's about an hour later. My manager walks past, looks at me. I smile at him, and he looks at the counter. He walks away without a word. I eventually count all the change and surprisingly they had only $18! \n\n&gt;Me: Hmm, I think that this is $18.\n\n&gt;(The duo has been dead silent. They look done for the night.)\n\n&gt;Me: I'll recount it.\n\nI fucking recounted it.\n\n&gt;Me: I think this is actually $19.xx.\n\n&gt;(Without a word, the Ringleader whips out a $5)\n\n&gt;Me: Seriously? You had cash?\n\n&gt;Ringleader: Needed to get rid of my change.\n\n&gt;Me. No problem. I'll just recount this again. I want to make perfectly sure that this is $19, since I counted $18 the first time.\n\n&gt;Ringleader: Are you kidding me?\n\n&gt;(I shake my head no, completely serious)\n\nHe takes out a $20 bill straight out of his pocket and throws it at me. My coworker gives the biggest WHAT THE FUCK face. Internally, I die as well, because they were smart enough to have a backup plan. And the fact that he was touching his cash in his pocket the entire time kinda messed with me. I take the cash, do the transaction, give him his change, thanked him and wished him a good night. The two start to put their pennies back in the ziplock bags and I didn't help them at all. I watched them just as how they watched me. Lots of pennies dropped to the floor, but they didn't care to pick them up. It looked like their souls were sucked out of them. It was past midnight and I clocked out way past when I was supposed to. A lot of my coworkers gave me a thumbs up or told me good night. Even my manager told me 'good job,' the only two words he ever said to me. Went to bed at the dorms after such a great petty penny night and crashed. Strange to say, but I'd love to count pennies again.\n\n\n**TL;DR** I recounted 1900 pennies like 5 times. Was it 5 times? I better count again.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the pennies, strangers!",

I scan the beer check their IDs and then they just dump a bag of mixed coins on my conveyor belt and start giggling. So I just moved my hand past the belt stop sensor and smiled as half their coins fell into the catch pan and they started freaking out and yelling. Manager comes over and intervenes, I then sloooowly pull out the filthy catch pan and start digging out their lost coins and counting. The conveyor belt came on once again (there's not another place to count the coins easily) and the process starts over. \n\nI end up spending about 20 minutes retrieving and sorting their coins before they just grabbed as many as possible and left without their beer. Success! ",

I pulled the pizzas out of the sleeve warmer and they grinned and held up a freezer bag of mixed change. I took it, shook it, and said \"You're short $7.\" \n\nThey looked at each other. Then back to me and said \"How do you know, you didn't count it?\"\n\n\"I know. I can tell by the weight. You're short $7.\"\n\nThat left them in a bit of a conundrum. They could either count it, as the onus was on them to prove me wrong, or they could whip out $7 and I'd be on my way. They chose the latter.\n\nGot myself a nice $10 and some change tip on that order. Manager didn't care about the coins because she was bored and loved rolling them on slow nights. ",

I laughed all the way through, so glad you had the wherewithal to stick to your plan.\n\nThe reason I stopped as I was scrolling is I have two five gallon water bottles at home, one full of pennies and the other has about 30 bucks in it. I keep a running total.\n\nMy plan is to make my last mortgage payment with them in about 7 years. I will take them to my bank dump them in the change counting machine, take the resulting change slip to the teller and deposit, then make the payment. Of course it could all change in seven years tho. \n\nAgain, well done Neon. \n\nEdit: For clarity, my apologies for any confusion regarding the change counter actually being a machine. ",

Now because of issues in the past, we are not required to take payments in coins over like, 10$ unless we want to. He didn't have coins, but he had over $500 in one dollar bills. I take pride in being overly friendly to assholes at my counter so when he got to me, I let him have it like OP did. I was disgustingly nice and saying things like, \"Wow I've never seen so many $1's! I feel like a banker, I love it!\" He was just infuriated even more. I counted as slow as possible and must have recounted at least 3 times. \n\nFuck that dude. ",

Most guests got angry that we didn't have a coin machine and we had to count and roll coin by hand - well, I would pull out several coin trays. Sadly, you can get pretty fast at sorting, counting, and rolling large amount of coins.\n\nSo one night, this Douche Canoe comes up with several large bags of pennies. (He wasn't a D.C. for having them - mostly - but for not listening and copping an attitude.)\n\nHe slaps the pennies on the counter and says he is going to go play and I can bring him his cash on the floor. I try to tell him I cannot count money without him watching to verify me. He tells me that I have a bad attitude, I'm lazy, and that coin is legal tender. (Um... I never said it wasn't.) I try to tell him one more time that I am not allowed to count the coins without him present, but he just flips me off and keeps walking.\n\nSo...I call surveillance, seal the bags, and put them by a surveillance camera. My 2nd favorite part: guest comes back irate that \"I am too lazy to walk his cash out to him on the floor and he has to return to the Cash Cage himself\" and my favorite part: he begins losing his s**t when he finds out that I haven't counted the coins yet, starts verbally abusing me, other guests complain, and he is escorted out the door by TGA.",

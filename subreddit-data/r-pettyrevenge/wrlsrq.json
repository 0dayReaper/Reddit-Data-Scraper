    "postText": "Last week, I was out and about, making a start on some errands I had. As I was walking, I was going through my long to-do list in my head. So I wasn't frowning, I wasn't smiling. My face was just in neutral.\n\nA man starts heading towards me. As we pass, he tells me, \"Smile, it could be worse.\"\n\nI stop, stare at him for a moment, and then I say, \"My parents were in an accident. My mum died on impact. We're turning off my dad's life support tomorrow.\"\n\nThe guy looked like a robot being suddenly shut down. His face fell. He looked like a deer in headlights. He stuttered and stammered. He was obviously trying to think of something to say, and when he couldn't, he turned around, and speed-walked away.\n\nMy parents are both fine. There was no accident. But it annoys me when people think they have the right to dictate how people are feeling and what expressions they make, especially when they don't know what is going on in their lives. It's unhelpful and patronizing. Imagine telling somebody who was just been given a terminal diagnosis, \"Smile, it could be worse.\" Or somebody who has lost a child, been laid off, or is otherwise struggling and in a terrible situation...?",

To which I gave my best impression of a joker grin, eyes wide and manic, eyebrows at my hairline, showing as many teeth as I possibly could. Then, with crazy smile on my face said between my teeth \"Am I pretty yet?\" The guy walked away pretty fast, not sure why.",

It must be such a brutal experience to sit there not knowing how to piece things back together - so openly in need of support - and have people just go about their lives around you as though you don't exist.",

She died on Saturday night and I considered asking  someone to take over but really it was just going to be taking four or five brief calls as staff arrived at the sites to check in and it would be a mess trying to find someone to cover. I took the calls and it was fine, all done in about 15 mins. \n\nA few days later a coworker asked if she'd done something wrong. I was confused and she said that I hadn't been my usual bubbly self when she'd called in. I explained that my gran had just died and she said \"Oh, thank goodness! I thought I'd done something!\" Followed instantly by her dying inside as she realised what she'd done. I love her dearly in all of her awkwardness though so while it probably still keeps her awake at night, I found it very funny.",

You related to them or something?', to which I said that they were my first cousin.\n\nThe friend then immediately sank in their chair apologising with their head in their hands.\n\n___\n\nAnother time, a few years before, I turned up early to a youth club I went to, when the lady in charge of it jokingly said 'You're here early. Have you been skipping school?'\n\nI then said that I'd just gotten back from my Nan's funeral. She then started apologising, but I remember reiterating a lot of times that it was fine; that there's no way she could have known; and that I wouldn't want her to feel like she had to watch her humour just on the off chance of 0.00001% that a person was at a funeral.",

I jump up, and head to the door so I can run out the second this bus comes to a stop. Bus stops. Door doesn\u2019t open. I\u2019m immediately horrified because I\u2019m feeling trapped on this bus with the driver and a couple of strangers (all men), and! I have to pee like I\u2019ve never had to pee before. I whip around to frantically look at the driver, pleading with my eyes for him to open the door and he says: \u201cHoney, I\u2019m not opening this door until you smile\u201d while grinning at me. I said, loud enough for the whole bus to hear: \u201cThen I\u2019ll pee all over your bus.\u201d He looked horrified and quickly opened the door. \n\nFirst time I ever stood up for myself to a stranger and I\u2019m still proud, lol.",

He said it's such an invalidating thing to say and usually starts the \"trauma Olympics\". \n\nHe then brought up the example of people who get diagnosed with cancer. No matter who you are, getting Cancer sucks big time. However anyone can come in and say \"it could be worse - you could have cancer AND [insert other terrible things to experience here].\"\n\nIt's just not nice at all since you basically are saying \"I don't think you should be upset since having cancer isn't enough of a problem on its own \"\n\n\nMy therapist also brought up the example of having car troubles. He told this story about a couple who got stranded on the way to a party because their car broke down. One was overly optimistic and the other pessimistic. The point was to show how even if what is being said is \"positive\" it still isn't helpful. It doesn't fix the car or get them to the party any faster. The important thing is to be real and try to do what you can in the moment. \n\n\nAnyways,  I definitely agree with you that minding my own business doesn't cost anything (in fact it saves me a lot of energy by not having to talk to people).",

You look like you're holding up pretty well. Can I get you something to drink? Maybe a water? Or would you like something a bit stronger like a margarita or a bloody Mary to help calm your nerves?\"\n\nEdit:  And no. I don't respond like that for sales. I couldn't care less about \"the bottom line\". I legit try to make my customers feel better and like they're not alone. Some people go out to eat just to be alone and away from the hospital but generally speaking, humans are of a social nature. While they don't always want to talk, there are times they do and need to vent. I take those times to try to connect with my customers and show them support. Some even seem bitchy at first but with the right words, tone and demeanor, they can settle down and stop treating you like some enemy but an ear to listen and maybe a little advice or different way of viewing things.\n\nEdit 2: we sometimes look for advice or some type of connection even when we don't know we need it. I don't push them to talk either. If they are uninterested, I kindly tell them if they need anything, feel free to ask. If they wanna talk, I'd be happy to talk to them, if they just want alone time, I'm happy to give that to them too. Whatever they need that I can do.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award.\u2764\ufe0f I greatly appreciate it and hope you have an amazing day, week, month, year.",

I was trying to mentally prepare for getting back into the groove after being unexpectedly away for two weeks, getting the two huge multi-day events I was planning for thousands of employees back on track, wondering how to handle the coworker who had spent the past six months undermining me when I would see her in a meeting later that same day, processing all of the tasks I needed to do to close my father's estate from 2000 miles away, and also trying to cram all the emotions of having lost my last parent into a tiny spot in my brain so I could be as productive as I needed to be. Que an older man entering the elevator right behind me and telling me to \"smile because it can't be that bad!\" I LIT into him about how it actually was pretty bad and for the next 9 floors he got an earful about why I might not want to smile just to make a man happy. He could not get off the elevator fast enough! Ironically, the whole scenario did make me smile a bit...so, mission accomplished?",

I left service before COVID, but friends in the industry told me masks were a godsend in nobody telling them to smile like a fucking idiot anymore. People suck.",

I have a stop over in Copenhagen on way home (sat in hotel bar now). As I was checking in to hotel I still had a mask on.. just habit i wore it all the way over. This big old fucking Dane rocks up to me as I\u2019m checking into hotel and tells me there is no covid in Denmark. I kinda brush him off, but he fucking persists. I\u2019m not in a great mood for obvious reasons. I just said goodbye to my dad for last time. He keeps babbling on, eventually i just say, my dads sick. I\u2019m wearing a mask to protect him, he starts saying some thing else but i cut him off with a very sharp. So I don\u2019t give a fuck what you think! I finished checking in and walked away.. not even sure what his reaction was but he went quiet\u2026 happened 30 mins ago...",

He'd always been the life of the party, brightened any room he came into, seemed to have everything going for him. It was such a shock that I almost shut down when I got the news. It didn't seem real.\n\nI had to walk away. I wish I'd thought to say 'My brother just died, go fuck yourself'. \n\nI'm sorry about your dad. Losing a close family member is tough.",

I was dealing with the worst grief ever and this didn't help. I barely held it together long enough to make it my stop.\n\nBefore it was annoying but I just ignored it but after that it really just rubbed me the wrong way so badly.",

We all wanted to go home and do what people do at home.\n\nThis bloke loudly said \"Oh come on, did somebody die or something?  What's wrong with  you all?\"  \n\nI got out of my seat and walked over to audibly tell him that I had been sitting at the bedside of someone in a hospice for the last five days.  She had nobody and even I didn't know who she was.  I held her hand and gave her sips of water.  I slept next to her. I pressed the morphine button when she whimpered for more.  \n\nHe looked arrogantly impassive until I asked \"Can you smell the miasma of death on me?\"",

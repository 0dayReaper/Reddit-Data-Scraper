    "postText": "I work in a public library. One of our newer services we offer is WifiPoint - it comes in a box and once it\u2019s checked out it\u2019s activated for seven days based on a mobile carrier service. After seven days it shuts off and has to be turned in and processed to turn on again. The wifi will not work after 7 days, and you can\u2019t get a new one until you turn in the old one. If you lose any part of it, you\u2019re fined and can\u2019t check out a new one until it\u2019s paid or the part is returned. If you have any charges over a certain amount, you can\u2019t check anything out period.\n\nWe don\u2019t have late fees, but we do have lost and damaged item fees, so those can add up quick. People can place items on hold and get added to a queue. If they don\u2019t pick the item up in five days, it goes to the next person in the queue.\n\nGenerally it\u2019s not a big deal, but there has been some ugly behavior over the wifipoint. We have scripted responses for most issues.\n\nCue today, when another staff member transferred a call to me saying \"please answer this, I can't\". (Uh oh.)\n\nMe, kill with kindness voice: [mandatory introduction] Thank you for calling Main Street Library reference desk, my name-\n\nPatron: Ugh I don\u2019t care about your name. Do you have my wifi box?\n\nMe: Can I get your name and birthday please?\n\nThere\u2019s two accounts with the name and birthday, so I chose the first. It was an expired account with a large charge attached, and no holds placed at all. So I checked the other account, and yes, a wifipoint is currently checked out and a hold for another. She\u2019s 200 and something in line.\n\nMe: It\u2019s not ready yet ma\u2019am. You\u2019re 2XX in the queue.\n\nPatron: I placed that a WEEK ago what is the hold up?\n\nMe, going from the script: unfortunately we only have so many wifipoints available and they are in high demand. For best practice, returning the boxes at the end of their seven day check out period will help the queue move quicker.\n\nPatron: I ain\u2019t driving all the way over to the library just to drop off one until I can get my next one. This is a shitty ass system, why don\u2019t you just get more?!\n\nMe, using my automatic response when people start yelling: You\u2019ll get the notification when your hold request is available for pick up.\n\nPatron: I want it now. If I go in and snatch one off the shelf you can\u2019t stop me!\n\nMe: We have a long holds queue ma\u2019am, they\u2019re all checked out or on hold for someone in the queue.\n\nPatron: What about those fucking ones on the shelf?! The frog whatever.\n\nMe: [script] we discontinued the Hoppin' offerings on wifipoints to make more available for the holds queue and better serve our patrons.\n\nPatron: It\u2019d BETTER SERVE ME if you just gave it to us! I need internet!\n\nMe: All of our library locations have free wifi available 24/7 in our outdoor rest areas and computers for public use during operating hours.\n\nPatron: You smart ass, having all the answers! Blah blah blah\n\nShe carried on for several minutes, while I muted my phone. I\u2019m looking at the two accounts and confirming it\u2019s the same person who somehow got two cards. It happens.There\u2019s a note in her record from two years ago that she confirmed all the items were damaged and she knew about it, but was hostile to staff.\n\nCue petty revenge. I merged the two accounts. Her currently checked out items and holds are now combined with her old charges.\n\nI cheerily interrupted and told her if there was nothing else I could help her with, then she could check her account online at any time or she would get a notification about when her hold would be ready, but she\u2019d have to pay the 480+ dollar fine first.\n\nShe freaked out and demanded what I meant, and I told her the list of items and charges, and how she can\u2019t check out anything until the fine is paid.\n\nI had to deal with her a few more minutes, but she had stopped the name calling and was near panic as I repeatedly told her there was nothing I could do about her charges. I could have put in a special case request to have them waived (common for us to do for people with fines from childhood or extenuating circumstances), but I didn\u2019t feel particularly generous. I added a second note to her account that patron was hostile to staff, so nobody else would feel like doing it either.\n\nBe nice to your public servants.\n\nEdit to add: when we discover duplicate accounts, we are supposed to merge them. This is protocol. Sometimes I ignore it, which I probably shouldn't admit to doing. I just took pleasure in doing it this particular time.\n\nTLDR: lady decided to swear and call me names over a wifi access point, So I blocked her account by attaching her old fines.",

Unfortunately I didn\u2019t check it before we left so I really had no proof that we hadn\u2019t lost it, though. \n\nI thoroughly searched and didn\u2019t find it anywhere which confirmed that my kids hadn\u2019t opened and lost it. When I went in and told them they were a bit condescending at first but I firmly (but nicely) told them we did not have it or see it at all and they were nice enough to take it off our account. Now I always make sure to check the cases before we check out.",

How? Because the only way they knew the amount on the document was if I had already submitted it. But due diligence, I had to call the government agency to confirm that they had received payment. I was on hold for quite a while and when I finally got through I said I imagine you've been getting shat on the whole day even though this glitch is not your fault. I just need to confirm that payment was received, and I hope your day gets vastly better and you have the beverage of your choice waiting for you when you get home. The woman's voice was kind of choked up and she said thank you for understanding - it has been truly horrible. \n\nI have commiserated with so many people about customer service horror stories.

By six, I\u2019d out read the entire children\u2019s section and my mom started taking me library hopping so I could read different things. I think we ended up going to half a dozen different ones before I just moved on to different sections, and then was just punished all the time for not earning straight A\u2019s and not taken anymore. \n\nFast forward to my freshman year of college. I need to watch some movie or check out a book or something, so I got back to my OG library. The woman at the desk asks for my card, I pull it out, and she sees that it\u2019s this crumpled, well/worn but still legible paper card. She starts saying they\u2019ve updated their system and it must have been some time since I\u2019d last been in. Now they\u2019re using plastic cards with serial numbers and she\u2019ll have to get me started with one of those. I shrug and say okay and start filling out her form. \n\nWhen I go to hand it back, she says needs the old card back for their records per policy. I shrug and hand her the card and she FREEZES. There\u2019s probably a solid 30 seconds that go by with her just staring at the card. I can practically hear the gears in her head crunching while she\u2019s working through what she\u2019s going to do. She looks up at me and says, \u201cI can\u2019t take this.\u201d I\u2019m confused so I ask her if something\u2019s  wrong. She says, \u201cI can\u2019t take this from you. This was your very first library card. You need to keep this.\u201d I just kinda stammered something like, \u201cokay. Are you going to get in trouble, though?\u201d She laughed and said she always gets in trouble so it\u2019s fine. I thanked her and left. I told my mom when I got home and she must have called and made sure the woman didn\u2019t get in trouble and gave her sooooo much praise lol when I went back to return whatever it was that I had needed, she winked and thanked me and said she got a raise. \n\nI get the impression that you\u2019re like her. \ud83d\ude0a",

When I checked out a book, the librarian \"punched the card,\" transferring the number and the day's date onto the removable card from the pocket of the back of the book. Then she hand-stamped the due date on the slip taped above the pocket. \n\nI can still hear the \"ka-chunk\" of that machine. If the patron's card or the checkout card were weakened somehow, getting the machine to stamp took some finagling. Kinda like putting a crumpled dollar bill into a vending machine. \n\nMy childhood library closed its original facility and moved into a new building last month. It was time. Like my old library card, the old building had crumbled, and it had become waterlogged. No more photocopying the periodicals in the basement.",

It hurts my heart to see crucial appreciated services taken away by people who never interact with patrons and don't know the real costs of their supposed budget cut. But we do the best we can, find alternatives, and keep going. Even on the worst days, it's still my favourite job.",

It's not worth the effort to collect fees and dissuades people from using the library. Stolen books or equipment are the only thing that should have fines or collection orders attached to them. The fines are maybe 1-2% of the operating budget and sometimes cost more to enforce than they collect in revenue.  Fees target parents **very harshly** in practice: they tend to check out many books at a time, get busy, and forget.  Additionally children's books don't last long and get weeded rather quickly because kids ruin stuff. That's just how it goes. Even if it gets \"stolen,\" aka lost and forgotten by a parent, it was probably on it's way to the book sale or dumpster anyway.\n\nE: looked it up.  \"Stolen\" children's books are only charged $5 rather than the full replacement cost.  'cause, you know, they're beat to shit and don't last long.\n\nPrinting fees were eliminated for COVID.  50 b/w or 10 color prints are free *weekly* now.",

Ten years later I tried to check out a book from the library, and in the process of reopening my account, they still claimed I owed the 50 cents from that \"print\" years ago. Yeah...they wouldn't let me check the book out.",

I'm not going to go out of my way to break policy for someone being a jerk (documented over years), but I sure as heck will ignore a broken policy for someone simply being civil.

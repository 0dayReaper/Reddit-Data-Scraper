    "postText": "My gmail address is short and sweet, easy to remember, no numbers or anything like that, just my first and last names. \n\nProblem is that it seems that people with a name similar to mine use it as one of those throwaway addresses you give when you're filling out some stuff for a random company and you don't want to give away your data. This means I get a LOT of spam. I get crap from all over the Americas, the US, Mexico, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador (my surname sounds Hispanic) and it gets VERY tiresome. VERY. I sometimes get an honest mistake, like an email from a school in Texas or something, and I write back telling them that it's not the correct address, and I get a thanks back. I'm not a complete monster! \n\nBut every now and then these guys overstep the mark. They use this email address (which remember, they have no access to) to sign up for stuff you really might not want other people to be able to fuck around with. \n\nCue petty revenge. \n\nSome random guy in California used a dating site using my email. I use the lost password feature to go onto his account, insult his prospective \"bitches\" then delete the account altogether. I got an email from a Brazilian car dealer asking if I wanted a full service package with some extras, to which I said yes! Absolutely! Order all the necessary parts and material! Strangely, I never heard from them again. \n\nMy favourite was a rental car reservation some moron used my email for. I got access to a reserved area and added some extra insurance and a couple of extra days to his rental period. I have some schadenfreude when I think of him wanting to leave the with car but having to go through the trouble of having to cancel my add ons. Ha! Ha! Fuck you! \n\nThere's a moral here, kids. Don't use random email addresses for stuff.\n\n(edited for typos)",

Any other gmail-based email has to use numbers or some other character to differentiate it from mine. Most of the time, it's the customer, but every once in a while, especially with a smaller company, it's the company. I've gotten chiropractor appointments from Georgia, haircut appointments from NC, and I'm in the midwest. Usually just takes a quick email to the company to fix, but with idiot users who drop the numbers it sometimes takes drastic measures.",

And i constantly get calls and texts to come out and vote in NC, a state i live nowhere near. And the debt collectors began again.\n\nThat was 4-5 years ago.. then this year they started up again for someone who i assume is his wife, same surname but female first name. It's super annoying calling all these people and letting them know they are looking for someone who had my number literally almost 2 decades ago.\n\n\nThere was another guy who had a very similar # to mine, 1 digit off, in the same place as the correct digit if you are typing on a computer numpad vs a phone numpad.\n\nI would get lots of his Dr appt confirmations and such like that because the people would type it improperly, that one wasn't his fault though.",

I knew the name of her husband, dog and her password to multiple things including netflix and her gym, because she emailed herself reminders from her work address. I knew when she was going away due to the flight information,  and that she was kenneling her dog, and had emailed herself an email chain from her work email stating she wasn't bothering with a house sitter because 'insurance hee hee'. She was horrified when she told me to prove it, and I recited some of the details I knew. I told her she was lucky I was also a good natured Aussie and would delete all her information, but if she used my email again I'd report her to the AFP fraud prevention for sending her details out to a stranger (not sure if thats a thing but it scared her enough to make her stop).

A couple of the people responded and said that of course this was lame - the real party is after all this... and shut up about how lame it is, the father-in-law is in the email chain, etc. Ok, so I respond with basically, \"yeah - alright, so long as hookers and blow are involved.\" My thought was that they'd finally figure out I'm not their friend... buuuuut apparently, that was exactly their intention. Yikes. \n\nThen, I find out who these idiots are by stalking them on FB. Most are recently married, and young. I could really fuck up these people's lives if I wanted. I was ready to just ghost because it wasn't silly fun anymore.. it was gross. \n\nThen I got an email that was... very threatening. \n\nIt was vague but I got the sense they finally figured out that I'm not the person they thought I was, but still had no idea who I was. But I knew when and where this afterparty was happening, I had all of the emails about what their intentions were. They probably didn't know that I knew they were all married. I'm sure they were scared... and these dipshits decided that it would be in their best interest to try to get me to fuck off.\n\nI shared this story with some friends and my wife. Some just said to let it go... not worth it to fuck with people who could try to retaliate. Some said I should let the wives know or blow it up in some other way. But then someone asked to see their FB pages.. and I shared this with my wife for the first time and she recognized one of the guys in the email chain. She worked with the dude and even went on a bad date with him. She was able to tell me shit about him that only close friends would know... some CIA level shit.\n\nI came to the conclusion that I didn't want to ruin these dirtbag's lives, but I also didn't want them to think they could just randomly threaten me (and some of the emails i got from this crew got weird). I wanted them to get the very distinct impression that they should never, ever fuck with me and that they're shitty people. \n\nI wrote an email to the one I had insanely good information on. Basically, I said that I wasn't going to make it and nobody should go. I've changed my life and maybe this wasn't the best idea. I said something to the effect that we should hang out again and went through a litany of all the things we could do together because it's \\*everything\\* about this person. I drop names of people who were in his circle and what they meant to him. Old coworkers. Reminisced about some of the stuff that happened in his life. What's funny is that I don't even know if this person they thought I was would know all of this information.\n\nAll of the weird emails from this group stopped. No response. Pure ghost. I have no idea what happened, but they didn't want anything to do with me. I can't imagine how spooked I would be if a stranger knew intimate details of my life.",

My story with having a first name.last name gmail account was from over a decade ago and the woman who contacted me wanted me to change my gmail account so she could have it for her new business she was starting up.  I sent a big LMAO back as a reply.  She then replied that she wasn't sure what LMAO meant.  I didn't bother to reply because I knew I was not dealing with someone that was very tech or email savy and it would only become a huge issue that I might not have kept my cool with.  FYI - I don't have a very common name so it was a bit weird to even think that someone really existed with the same name.  Luckily she is in a different state and last I looked she was still without a driver's license due to her 3 DUIs in the past few years.",

I let him know that if he did it again I would be canceling each and every tee time he made in the future.  I've had accounts created for at least 10 dating websites in my name.  Luckily my wife trusts that it is not me creating those.  I will generally wait until they get a few matches, then change the password on the account.  I've had people apply for loans using my account, including sending along all of their personal info, address, phone number, employment history, income, social security numbers, and so on.  I get notified of various doctor appointments all of the time.\n\nMy favorite recently was getting tickets for an entire banquet table at a Ducks Unlimited banquet.  They valued the tickets at like $700.  Not that I have any interest in that sort of thing, but it would have been fun to crash.\n\nI've had money sent to me a few times mistakenly.

Being in college at the time I decided that I needed some sort of professional sounding email address when I got sent the Gmail Beta invite.  I picked my first initial and my lastname.  At this point in time I was a denizen on the internet, mostly on gaming message boards that no longer exist.  I never really thought the internet would get so big or at least not so popular with a population that would struggle with something as simple as an email address.  I definitely didn't think that a huge amount of people with the name first initial and lastname would make these mistakes over and over again.\n\nMuch like a lot of the people in here, I've gotten tons of different type of emails intended for others. Also a ton of accounts I never signed up for or accounts that I've had to reclaim since they are based on email address.\n\nSome of the things I've gotten:\n\nDentist appointments, Ski Lift tickets, Restaurant reservations, Medical Malpractice/Liability Insurance forms, important verisign documents, inspection reports.  Scary things like SSN and school information for minors (that was supposed to go to parents/aunts/uncles/guardians), pictures of these kids.  I always tried to do what I could to tell people and businesses that they were given the wrong address.  Sometimes there it just simply no way to report something.\n\nThere is was one a few years ago that really freaked me out.  I assume this Grandmother was given access to Life360 GPS/Phone Tracker to the rest of her family.  I didn't spend a lot of time in the account, but there were at least 6 other people attached to it.  I was able to remove my email address and change the recovery method to the phone number that was attached.  I did a password reset to send a reset to that phone number and wiped my hands of it.\n\nI can't even keep track of how many I've gotten, a lot are ignored, but I do try to make things right.  It really blows my mind how negligent people are.  We all know there are some pretty evil people out there, people who are willing to commit crimes with other people's info.  It's not even just their personal info I've gotten, it's their families too.  Everyone should take an interest in what their families share about them via email or just on social media sites.",

Those who came after and wanted the same email address seem to frequently forget to add the numbers when signing up for something. So I get a lot of ads that I definitely didn't sign up for. But once in awhile, it's simply that someone slipped up and forgot the numbers.\n\nThe worst I ever did was start sending jokes around a company because they kept using my email address. I was polite at first and told them they had the wrong email address. But it continued. Sometimes they had clients included in these emails. So I started responding to all (because they also didn't know how to use BCC). I'm sure I made them look a little unprofessional to their clients a few times, but it didn't stop them. At one point, they sent a company-wide email out. And my email was on the list. I'm fairly certain my funny responses caused a drop in productivity that afternoon. It was at that point they finally fixed their address book.\n\nA few months ago, I suddenly got someone's flight itinerary. I couldn't bring myself to mess with the guy, but it crossed my mind that I could probably get into his account and cancel his flight. Again, I did not do that. I just can't be that malicious.",

She applied for a loan at a car dealership and put down my email. She used my email to sign up for fantasy football. I used the lost password feature to get access and wreck her team. She was logged in on the app, and it didn\u2019t kick her out. She fixed her team, so I wrecked it again. Did that for three or four weeks and she finally gave up. \n\nThe kicker was when she actually applied to a job. I again used the lost password feature and gained access to her application, which gave me her address, phone number, and social security number. I didn\u2019t do anything with the social, because I too am not a monster. I used a burner phone number app to text her and I asked her to please stop using my email.

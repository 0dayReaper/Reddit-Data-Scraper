    "postText": "So, a couple of days ago I was involved in a situation involving my sucky family. I actually ended up taking it to AITA because I wasn\u2019t sure if I was in the wrong. Spoiler, I wasn\u2019t. The TL;DR version to know of the events is that my brother, with a history of verbal abuse, went off on me for not delivering the packages he accidentally sent to my apartment despite him knowing that I was way too busy to do so that day. My entire family stood behind him, and I was yelled at multiple times. If you\u2019re interested in reading the post, you can do so here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1461fmb/aitah_for_not_letting_my_brother_pick_up_his/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1\n\nTonight I get this text from my dad, and I wish I could attach pictures because this is 10000% real and I swear to God it is just perfect timing:\n\u201c[The dog] got sprayed by a skunk. [Your brother] too. Can you go to Walgreens on [street near my apartment] and get skunk shampoo? If they don't have it then hydrogen peroxide\u201d\nThat text was sent at 9:58 PM. It is now 11:13 PM, and my dad must think that I\u2019m sleeping because I\u2019m not responding. I\u2019m not getting the skunk shampoo. Hell, I\u2019m not getting it tomorrow. My dad can either go get it himself or my brother can, but I\u2019m not going out of my way to help the family that screamed at me for setting a boundary designed to protect my mental and physical safety.",

Not getting the shampoo was perfect. Keep that up. If they ask why you are LC..be honest. You are no longer tolerating their yelling and verbal abuse. Physical abuse means a call to the police\u2026please follow through if that ever happens again. They won't stop until the message is received\u2026go NC as required.",

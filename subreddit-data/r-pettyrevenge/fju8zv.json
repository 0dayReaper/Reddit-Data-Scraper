    "postText": "Saw a couple who had filled their trolley with toilet roll arguing with an elderly couple who had asked for one packet because there wasn\u2019t any on the shelves and they\u2019d ran out. These 2 were a right piece of work and being quite abusive to the elderly couple. I went over to the elderly couple and told them to finish their shopping and that I would come and find them. They go off and arsehole couple carry on what they\u2019re doing. When their backs are turned I grab 2 packets out of their trolley, go and find the elderly couple and give it to them. I then went and found a shop assistant and told them about arsehole couple being abusive to the elderly and when they get to the checkout their trolley is taken off them and they\u2019re escorted out by security. This has made me extremely happy.",

I refuse to ever pay full price for something I buy specifically to throw away :-) pet peeve of mine. I can't stand the ultra soft stuff. just does not work well (at least for me) and you need so damned much of it!",

I want to be as dry and *clean* as possible.  the 1000 sheet 1-ply does the trick and a roll lasts forever.\n\nMy husband bought the TP last time we were low and it was NOT Scott 1000 (well, the store brand, cuz I too am cheap).  I suffered for a few weeks and then this bullshit hit.  Now I only have 3 rolls left of this crappy stuff and no Scotts variation anywhere in sight.  I went to 6 stores today, including a hardware store, a restaurant supply store, and a hole-in-the-wall Chinese store and NO ONE had toilet paper of any sort.\n\nI bought a pack of napkins. I will prolly like the texture better than the TP I've been using.  Hubs is fussing about throwing it in the garbage instead of flushing tho.  He got online and ordered a bidet.",

Manager *fwomp* appears, hold up a hand and firmly tells Karen she isn't buying anything today, she may return to the store tomorrow.  As she starts to harmekarme the manager heads her off with \"if you don't leave now without a fuss, you'll be banned from this store.\"  \n\nKaren thought better of it and stalked out with trails of smoke from her ears.  I laughed with delight.",

The theory was that in times of chaos people will resort to any sort of mental victories they can get and any control they can have and TP was one of them the minute people started panic buying. \n\nOnce one person panic bought, a wave of panic buyers did the same. Once the news started covering it, the rest of society HAD to go out and panic buy for fear of being left out.",

This panic buying bullshit nis rediculous and I'll be goddamned if babies are gonna die from lack of formula.\n\nEdit: just want to clarify. By \"desperately looking\" I mean she had a bottle of the super expensive pre-mixed stuff in her hands. I asked if she needed formula.",

I went the other night before all hell broke loose and grabbed some because we were down to 1 can and I wasn't even thinking about this whole thing it's just my normal routine. That being said if anyone I knew was out and couldn't find any formula I would gladly just give them a can. I feel like if people are going to panic when shit like this goes down then stores should automatically start restricting sales. Like ok you can have 1 of whatever is on restriction.",

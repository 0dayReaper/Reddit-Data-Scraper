    "postText": "TL/DR: Neighbor's son is harassed by Karen boss. Finds another job. Before he leaves he rigs a scandalous email to be cc'd to entire dept over Memorial Day.\n\nNeighbor's son, \\*Garth\\* graduated college about this time last year and got his first, fulltime career job at a company. He's in the IT dept of a branch office and does IT things. Total number of employees at this office is around twenty. Some are sales, some work in the office. Karen is the office manager. When Garth first started, there were three IT people. They had an office in the basement away from the rest of the employees. This suited Garth just fine; he's a quiet, introverted young man. Highly intelligent, but he's not a social person. Would rather spend his time off gaming than live interaction. As you can imagine, he's not a big kid, maybe a buck-fifty after eating a big steak for dinner.\n\nThe other two IT people eventually move on to other jobs and corporate doesn't replace them. Now Garth has three times the work without receiving a raise. Garth voices his concerns to Karen about workload and callouts, and he gets the standard feeble corporate responses and condescending lecture. I don't know why he didn't quit then, but he stuck it out hoping to eventually be recognized for his worth, etc.\n\nWhenever I spoke with him he'd say how bad it was working for Karen, but his saving grace was he was in his solitary office most of the day and did not have to have much contact with her. Until one day back in February. He got a phone call from Karen telling him to come upstairs.\n\nUpon arriving, he's directed to start moving furniture around. Garth takes a look around and tells Karen his job does not call for moving heavy objects. Karen gets loud and calls his manhood into question in front of everyone but Garth does not budge.\n\nLife changed for Garth after that. Karen had decided to make work miserable for him. She started repeatedly writing him up for whatever she could think up.\n\nHere comes the petty revenge. Garth starts snooping and discovers that Karen is having an affair with a married co-worker. Their work phones are synced up to the computer system, which Garth has access to. Garth has created a mass corporate email with various screenshots of the sexting. He rigged it to be sent out today - from her own email account.\n\nThe beauty of it all: Garth walked in Friday and tendered his resignation to corporate HR. He left his ID card and whatever else on Karen's desk. Karen made a big deal of shouting to Garth as he was leaving to, \"Not let the door hit him in the ass on the way out!\"\n\nWhen the email is sent out, they may well suspect that Garth was the perpetrator, but they'll never be able to prove it. I can only hope Garth's revenge is sweet and spectacular.",

She probably can\u2019t clear a jam in the printer, much less trouble shoot why the network isn\u2019t seeing one of the office computers. This revenge is going to go on for a while. Awesome!",

Something I did when I was employed by them, over and above my regular duties. I asked for more money, they said they couldn't afford it. One day on site as a sub paid me more than I used to make there in a week. They should have given me that pay raise. I was there a lot, because the employees abused the crap out of everything.",

Two completely different businesses can use the same computers, servers, and network software, sooo...they assume that anyone who ran one businesses' IT department can seamlessly transition to running the other one's.\n\nThere's a lot more to it, and having at least one native guide is vital to smooth operations. An evil boss that was smart would have given him a raise and promotion title, brought in a second IT person for at least 3 months under the guise that IT senior tech will occasionally take vacation and sick days.\n\nOnce transition is complete, bring in a third guy and train him up, then after three months, find some excuse to get rid of original guy. OG gets a big raise when he looks for a new job because of \"promotion\" title, and Karen-boss gets rid of OG, without massive company-wide melt-down.\n\nNot to mention avoiding revenge trap.",

I remember being kind of surprised when I discovered that he was regularly spending time during the day on their members site. And some of those URLs, wow.

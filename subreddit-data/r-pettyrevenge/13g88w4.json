    "postText": "This is less of a petty revenge story per se, so much as an ask of who else had a standard petty revenge MO waiting tables in high end restaurants and country clubs like I did once upon a time...\n\nThose of us who have worked high end food service, with access to the bar, have inevitably learned that the secret to sparkling silver ware (*back in the day-maybe it's changed*) is to polish them with vodka. Usually the rail vodka, for obvious reasons. As a general rule, this is frowned upon by management, but it's spectacular for an inspection or VIP and *especially* petty revenge. Every high end place I ever worked that punished me, or the staff as a whole, by keeping us/me late to polish, was an opportunity to reach for the top shelf and let the management *feel our pain.*    \n     \nJust curious if there's anyone out there who did/still does this?",

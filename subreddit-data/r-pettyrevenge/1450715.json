    "postText": "During a work break I went to the canteen and got my drink out of the fridge. It tasted rank!\nOne of my colleagues sniggered and when I pressed him, he explained that Sally had added salt to it because she thought it would be funny. No big deal, but I don't like to be out done, so It was time for a plan.\n\nA few days later I bumped into Sally and told her about my drink, before she had a chance to laugh I went on to explain that I was allergic to salt and that I had to take a trip to the hospital for a an injection to reduce the allergy. She started to look suspicious so I reassured her that it happens quite often, it isn't a big deal, but it's a bit inconvenient and unfair for the hospital staff to have to deal with it. \nShe apologised profusely and looked very sheepish as she left.\n\nA week later she came up to me looking a bit angry and said 'humans can't be allergic to salt can they?'\nI sniggered a bit when I said no.",

I woke up sometime later when I couldn't move my feet and found someone had tied my shoelaces together. I untied them and went downstairs and discovered she and the kids had gone out...i then formulated a plan. I went back upstairs and laid down and tied the laces back together and waited for them to come home, just as I heard them coming in I called our house number from my cell and then jumped off the bed to make allot of noise like I had fallen while trying to answer the phone, and started groaning and had a packet of catsup I put on my head and hand. My wife came running up the stairs to see what had happened and there I was holding my head with \"blood\" covered hands. My wife was frantic, my daughter who had come up was scared but could see my face so I started smiling to let her know I was ok. My wife caught on and realized it was a prank, turns out she did it while I was sleeping then forgot about it and went on a walk with the kids, while on the walk she remembered doing it and thought that very thing could happen and hurried back to undo her handiwork....",

During introductions, a guy warned me that someone was stealing drinks from the lunch room. where we kept the lunch we brought from home. \nAt lunch; Yup. Someone had been drinking from my soda. I bought a new coke and started planning my revenge. I mean, who the hell would do something like this? Sicko!\n\nDay 2; I brought a new coke to work. The evening before, I had used a tool to lift the bottom ring of the cap far enough for it to go outside of the \"lock\", so I could unscrew the cap but still keep the ring attached to the cap.\nI had Carolina reaper, so a bit of the \ud83c\udf36 and a few drops of oil, mixed to a paste. \nAfter smearing it around the inside of the cap, careful to not leave any visible bits, I put the cap back. It wasn't perfect, but I hoped it wasn't too obvious.\n\nMy work area was near the kitchen, so I could see people enter and exit.\n\nThree hours in, a colleague walked out of the kitchen. After a few steps, he started panting. I don't know why he made it that far, but perhaps I had old chili? I had thought it'd start right away. \n\nOh, I forgot to mention that I had an alarm on my phone to remind myself to *not* drink it.\nJust before lunch, I had planned on buying a new coke and leave the *heated edition* there, for however long it took for the thief to drink from it. \n\nAnyways, watching him pant and gasp, I started to laugh. People looked at me, and came by to see why I was laughing so hard. From where I was, they too could see the kitchen door. And their thief.\n\nMr Nice Guy stood nearby. He laughed. I laughed. We laughed. Boss laughed. Wait-Wuuut? Shit!\n\nThe boss stood right behind us! I started freaking out, thinking I'd gone too far, but he was laughing his heart out.\n\nHR and the boss had a talk with him that afternoon, even while we all went home, hours later, and we never saw him again.\n\nHere, you have three months if they fire you, and one month if you quit.\nNot for him, though.\nI think a deal was made, like quitting without being charged, or some such deal. I am still curious as to why he'd steal sips. And what was said during that meeting. And if he ever did it again, elsewhere.",

You can't remove all known allergies to man from your food in case someone has a reaction. Legally, that would put the onus on you to put food in the fridge that won't react with someone when in reality the onus is on the person with the allergy to only consume things they know. Or unless they've bought it and the seller confirmed there was no allergen. But putting your lunch in the fridge isn't you committing to sell anything and assuming the legal responsibility of a retailer or food producer. That's a really weird way of looking at putting your food in the fridge!!",

This is specifically for working adults with disabilities in for parents who have children with disabilities. It allows people to pay a premium to get Medicaid services. This way people can continue to work and save money, and still get their medical care that they need in the case of the children, only the children with disabilities can be on it.  \n\n\nThis program saved my marriage. My son was born with a heart defect way before the affordable healthcare act. Back then he was uninsurable, and my husband made just a little too much money to be eligible for Medicaid and the only way we could get it for our son was to get divorced. Luckily, I found out about the buy-in program we\u2019ve been married for 38 years because of it. \n\n\nMaybe your state has something similar?",

Only problem is now, they stacked and inflated everything to the point where (can you say $600.00 band-aid?) it's actually becoming an embarrassment internationally as the global community shrinks and more Americans learn what other developed nations have. It's getting more difficult for the industries involved to justify. The general public is becoming savvy to the usual garbage reasons that they've been fed for decades of why it 'has to be that way.\" The price of insulin is a great example.   \n\n\nPeople often think that our pharmacare and hospital visits are cheaper or free because of the government picking up the tab, but the main factors are on price controls that exist in most of the developed world outside the US.

    "postText": "So, for some reference, I went to the local community college a few years back. It was a pretty good education for the cost, and the environment was fairly chill. It wasn\u2019t always the easiest to make friends because of the lack of activities/involvement, but generally a good place.\n\nOne fall, I was enrolled in a history class, and the professor was just a funny dude. We will call him Dr. Cool for purpose of this post. Dr. Cool got on the good side of the class, and was a pretty \u201cgo with the flow\u201d type guy. The one thing that we all agreed on, was that the class next to us could get annoying. This next-door professor was always loud during his lessons. We will call him Dr. Smith. His voice disrupted our class on multiple occasions throughout each session. So. Damn. Obnoxious. And worst of all, we could never escape it, as it started and ended at the same time as ours.\n\nOne day, I hatched a brilliant idea: during the last week of class, place a fart machine in that class (well, really a bluetooth speaker and a fart app) to get back at them for disrupting us the entire semester. I met up with a couple of the students one day and discussed my plan, unsure of how they would react. Turns out, they were completely in on it.\n\nSo one day, I unsuccessfully attempted to pull this off by bringing my own speaker. However, something didn\u2019t work. I think the range was too long or something. So the next time, as classes are wrapping up, we try again. This one kid brings an expensive and loud portable speaker, and we sneak in before classtime and place it underneath the podium in front of the room, so no one would spot it.\n\nTo keep the silence (because this wireless speaker, like most, makes a \u201cding\u201d sound when connection is detected), he left it on and ran a silence track through Youtube. We were all set for action.\n\nAs our class starts, we can barely contain ourselves because of the devious stunt we all knew was about to happen. We tell Dr. Cool, and he is completely in on this. We decide to let one rip every time Dr. Smith makes the loud remarks we can hear so evidently through the walls. And so, once he makes his existence known to the floor, our professor signals us that it's time.\n\nMy classmate, at the direction of Dr. Cool, pressed this fart trigger on his phone, and it was WAYY louder than we thought. You could\u2019ve heard that thing on the other end of the hall. Our class is nearly erupting into laughter, and our professor tells us to keep quiet as best as we can. I\u2019m honestly surprised that Dr. Smith never stopped with those loud remarks, because of the pattern. He gets loud, and a blast is heard in return. Additionally, he never came into our class to confront us.\n\nWe do this probably 10-15 more times throughout our day there. The app this kid picked was so realistic and diverse, you would've left that room wondering what the hell Dr. Smith was eating to have left such thunderous gas in front of a room full of students.\n\nI\u2019ll say, our school was pretty chill. But on one fateful day, we ruptured that mood with much-deserved blasts that served as a legacy moment in time. A class that needed to hear what we thought of them. What a beautiful moment in my life.",

In their office they had a small machine on the wall that dispensed air freshener through out the day. One day he was in a Spencers store and saw a can of Fart spray. The fart spray can was exactly the same size as the air freshener can. Need I say more? It took them a week to figure out it wasn't one of the office people. The manager was walking by the machine when it sprayed was how they found it. They never figured out who put it there.",

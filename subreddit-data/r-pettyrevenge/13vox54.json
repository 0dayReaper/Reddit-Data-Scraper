    "postText": "I have a horrible mother. She is a narcissist self centered prick who made my life miserable because she was miserable. The only reason I am still in contact with her is because, even if she was a terrible mother to me, she is a good daughter to my grandparents, and I love my grandparents to death. \nI moved away when I was 20 and live in another side of the planet, (she is in Venezuela, I am in the Netherlands), so she is my grandparents caregiver. \n\nBecause she f-me up so bad growing up I got PTSD, anxiety, codependency issues, depression and so many other problems that  is difficult to tell. \n\nHere comes the pettiness.\n\nShe is absurdly competitive with me so I literally have won to her in everything in life and every time I do so I make a big deal out of it. \n\nHere is the list:\n\nThe day of my 18th birthday to the present: How nice is to be young and childless. I can go to party all day or travel without worries! \n\nThe day of my wedding: How nice is to marry someone because you are in love and not because you get knocked up. Its terrible to keep your children in that toxic environment. I want to bring my future children to a loving home.\n\nWhen we got a house: How cool it is to finally have a house to my name. My children would be able to feel secure and nobody could chase them away. (She never got that, because she is perpetual financial debt because terrible financial management. I have moved 34 times until I was 18 and move on my own, because we were evicted over a over again.\n\nLater than that I limited my contact with her more, so I stopped. But everytime she is around when I am talking to my gramps, I made sure to throw her a little stone. \n\nShe can't even complain because my gramps knows what she did to me and they are always on my side.",

I didn't even have belongings that didn't fit in a suitcase. Thanks to that I almost became a hoarder when I finally got a proper home but fortunately my husband noticed and got me into help.",

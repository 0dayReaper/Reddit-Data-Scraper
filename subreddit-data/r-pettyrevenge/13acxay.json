    "postText": "I witnessed this happen when I was younger and my parents and I still joke about this incident to this day. This was actually revenge that my dad got on this lady. \nSo for background we used to have a neighbor who hosted a \u201creligious studies\u201d class next door. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem except she herself admitted that it was more of a glorified babysitting service out of her house. That is irrelevant here though. There was this specific mom who would constantly come to pick her kid up 30 minutes early and let her 5 year old run on our yard in front of our house. Besides the obvious safety concerns with the kid climbing our tree and is not knowing this family, the kid had a tendency to walk up to our dining room window and terrorize our dog through the glass. My dad went out one day and asked her to stop letting her kid on our property and politely informed her there was a playground within sight of our house that was for the community. She apologized and my dad went back in the house. Not 5 minutes later she let her kid go back onto our front yard and her kid continued the terrorizing of our dog. My dad again went out and more sternly asked her to leave, this time pointing out her child was making our dog freak out through the window. She apologized but once my dad went inside she let her kid continue once again. \nMy dad had enough and decided this was an perfect opportunity to water our lawn. She was pretty upset because her phone got wet and her kid was upset because he got wet too. She nor her kid did not touch our property again.",

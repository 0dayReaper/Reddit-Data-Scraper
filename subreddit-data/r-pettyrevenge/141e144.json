    "postText": "This happened a few years ago. My gf at the time (now wife) and I used to vacation in Asheville, booking cabins through a rental company. She grew up there and loved it, plus she had friends/family in the area that we would visit while there. \n\nOne of the rules the company had was that no extra guest were allowed to stay overnight, or there would be a fee. This rule never bothered us, as we never planned on having that. But, we did invite a couple of my gf's friends over to hang out for a little while. They got there around 7-8 and stayed until about 11pm before heading home. We finished the trip, had a great time and went home thinking all was good. \n\nA couple days after we got home, I got an email from a woman in the rental company who claimed that their maintance guy saw that we had people stay over and we were being charged an extra $200 for breaking \"occupancy\" rules! Next came a back and forth between her and I where I told them noone stayed overnight, and that they left around 1030-11pm. But she claimed to me that \"Occupancy\" is anyone being in the cabin at all, which made no sense I looked up the legal definition of occupancy which did not side with her, but she told me it didnt matter and they would charge me the extra 200. Cue the Revenge. \n\nBetween my gf and I, we got about 8 people with 20 different google accounts all leaving 1 star reviews on the company's google page. This took their rating of around 4.4 all the way down to the mid 3 stars (it was a local company). Well someone higher up must have gotten wind of this and they knew exactly who did it. Within a couple hours, I got several emails from the original woman and her supervisor apologizing for the misunderstanding and asking how they could get us to take down the bad reviews. \n\nAfter telling them it was clearly not a misunderstanding, I told them to kick rocks since they wanted to treat us that way, and long story shorter than it could be, we ended up getting an offer of 200 off our next visit if we took the reviews down (and they obviously refunded me that extra 200 plus another 100 off that stay). Karen, I hope you understand what occupancy means now, if you still have a job.\n\nEdit: Spelling.",

The owner saw them hanging out on the patio (not even in their room) and threw them out because no extra overnights. After a serious complaints to booking.com they got a full refund so that meant 3 free days on the beach.\n\nYes, I get it, no extra free guests can sleep, but fuck you if you think noone can visit.",

It was expensive, like a whole-house deal, and she had to hire people to move her furniture out of the way. Basically the main company said they were not responsible for what their third party contractors did. So she took them to court over it, and they back-pedaled like crazy. She said she'd consider dropping the case if they explained in a 3-paragraph essay what the laws stated they were responsible for along with the refund.  She got no reply, took them to court, and won not only her refund, but legal fees, and some extra nuisance fees, I guess.",

I'm glad the story turned out how it did and that the revenge plot worked, but frankly most review sites need to have better quality control of reviews per their own TOS. \n\nMost sites that host reviews have a rule that the reviewer must have interacted with the product or service, to prevent review bombing or review inflation. By that rule, only the occupants and their guests would be at liberty to have their reviews published. \"I've never stayed here or visited here, but my friend told me this place sucks\" is, then, against sites' TOS.\n\nHowever, many sites are notoriously bad about allowing coordinated review-bombing to remain active and published, despite their terms of service saying otherwise. It's happened to a couple favorite local businesses of mine and there was no recourse, despite many of the reviews brazenly saying that they'd never visited or used the business in question.\n\nMy guess is that for every success story like OP's, there are several kind, genuine small businesses drowning under review bombs because a small issue--or outright non-issue--pissed off the wrong person.",

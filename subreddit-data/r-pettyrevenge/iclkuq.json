    "postText": "I don\u2019t mind when my roommates borrow my stuff. We\u2019ve all been there. All I ask is that they replace what they take. You drink my milk? Just buy me a new milk. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nUnfortunately my roommate doesn\u2019t seem to get this. She keeps taking my stuff and when I ask her to please replace everything she takes she\u2019ll buy one new thing and \u201cforget\u201d to do it the next time despite having more money than me.\n\nI finally snapped when I wanted to wash my clothes but only found an empty box that used to contain my washing powder. I don\u2019t buy fancy or expensive stuff and I don\u2019t care about brands. After using the last of my powder a week earlier she could literally have bought the cheapest no-brand powder in the world and I would have been fine. I just snapped. I had told her over and over to not use my washing powder if she wasn\u2019t going to replace it and I just had enough.\n\nI bought a new box of washing powder, some dylon machine dye, mixed it with a bit of the washing powder and dumped it into the old box. When the dye is dry it looks like  washing powder, especially if you\u2019re not expecting it. I took my new box of washing powder to my room and waited.\n\nA week later I came home from work and saw her laundry hanging outside, all with a mysterious pink color. She stomped up to me and demanded to know what I had done. I told her I was going to dye my own clothes and someone had told me the shade would be lighter if I mixed it with powder (lie), then asked her why she had used it when it had clearly been in a box with my name on it when I had told her not to use it because she never replaced it?\n\nI don\u2019t think she believed me but she finally got the message. She almost never takes my stuff and when she does she\u2019s quick to replace it.",

After the third time of coming home to a pile of wet laundry that smelled damp I had had enough. \nHe didn't know that the rack belonged to me and I was being kind to allow everyone in the apartment to use it. So I sold it. My office building had a laundromat and I had a locker anyways. \nWas fun when he got mad and asked where's the rack because he had just done a load. Said I was strapped for cash so I sold it. \nEnded up buying a better one a few weeks later and kept it locked in my room. He walked around smelling like old towels until he eventually bought his own.",

You put your basket on top of the machine you were using.

Any detergent left unattended in the laundry room is fair game for others, even if named.  In practice, detergent in a laundry basket was not touched.",

Now this campground was very large and had a lot of permanent residents so it was tough at times to get use. One time I get there and two of the washers are out of service and two of the others are being used by the same person which is no big deal. Well the load ends and 15 minutes later still they havent shown to take their clothes out. Finally I move the clothes from one of the washers to the top of the other washer and as I was finishing she pulls up in a rage. Complete lack of awareness of some people.",

When I took one of them, he got mad at me for eating one of *his* snacks, because apparently ownership goes to the guy who pushes buttons on the microwave.",

She stole my whole big thing of parm cheese that I had just bought to make her \"alfredo.\"  Which was literally just dumping the whole container into cooked spaghetti, I wish I was joking.  When I was moving I was finding more and more things that she stole, like quarters for the laundry, my dishes, etc.  So I dumped a whole thing of garlic salt into the sugar she used in her coffee (except she more had sugar with a hint of coffee but claimed she was one of those people who CaN't LiVe WiThOuT COFFEE).  While I was waiting for my new lease to start so I could move I kept hearing her complain her coffee tasted weird.  She even bought new sugar so I did the same thing again.  She had me taste it and I told her there was too much sugar for me to even like the coffee in the first place.  I managed to get my stuff she stole moved and had the manager of the property let me in her room to get my stuff back while they watched(college and they knew everything that was going on because her old roommates complained of her stealing as well,).  I'm so glad to be done with that shit.",

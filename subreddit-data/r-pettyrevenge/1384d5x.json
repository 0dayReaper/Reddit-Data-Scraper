    "postText": "Back when I was a teenager, I worked at a Sears that was a mall anchor store. On my first day, I ended up working alone in my department and had no training other than the general store and cash register training. I winged it. Things didn't get much better.\n\nAfter a few shifts, I meet Lazy Coworker (LC). She disappears out into the mall for a couple hours. One day, LC berates me for not doing my inventory sheets and says the department manager is pissed that I'm slacking. I have no idea what she's talking about. She then shows me our office and mail cubbies containing the sheets. Remember, I had no departmental training and had no idea we even had an office. LC continues to disappear during our slow weekday shifts. When the busy weekends roll around, LC hogs the cash register.\n\nA co-worker clues me in: LC is ringing up every customer under her ID so she gets all of the pitifully small commissions from them. I also hear rumors that she does returns under other IDs so she won't get dinged on her commissions (if an item was returned, you lost that commission).\n\nI finally get fed up with LC and start putting all my inventory sheets in her mailbox and ringing up all returns, regardless of who originally rang up the purchase, under her ID. Petty, but it was the only revenge I had as a young kid.",

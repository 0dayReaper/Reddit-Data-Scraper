    "postText": "Not sure if this is considered a petty revenge, but I once applied to a job near my house. We had an amazing interview. We were all happy and chuckling. They said, I answered the questions correctly, even the math test they gave me and I thought I got this interview in the bag. \n\nTowards the end of the interview, I asked when will I hear from them and they said the following week. I asked another question if they also call back those who don\u2019t qualify, because to me, if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d rather know, so I can move on. The manager was like, \u201cOh yeah. That\u2019s professional courtesy\u201d. The following week came and another week came by and another and I didn\u2019t hear back from them. I, honestly, forgot about it. 3 months later, I got an email from Indeed saying my qualifications match this job posting and it was from that same company, for the same position I applied to. \n\nI applied to it again. \n\nI thought they\u2019d skip me, since I applied before and didn\u2019t make the cut. They called me to schedule me for an interview. I said in the call that I\u2019m in the middle of something and will call them back. It\u2019s been about a week, I haven\u2019t called them back. They called me two more times and got an email, but I never called them back or replied to the email. \n\nLol. I know it\u2019s dumb, but that\u2019s me. \n\nPS I also understand why companies don\u2019t call you when you didn\u2019t get the job. I just wish they went with their word. They could\u2019ve, at least, worded it differently. Maybe something like, \u201cShould you get the job, we\u2019ll let you know immediately\u201d.",

The job that I have now is the one I started right after college and I frankly didn't have any experience with interviews as I only gave two interviews and got selected on the first one I applied to. \n\nIt's was very unsettling when I wouldn't receive call backs or emails letting me know if I had made it or if I was rejected. In the past 4 months I have given 8 interviews, I was rejected by 5 of them but only one of the company emailed saying I wasn't what they were looking for. The other 4 just ghosted me.\n\nI also had an HR from one of the firms tell me that \"No answer is also an answer. You're a woman, don't you already know that? You don't have to reject a person you don't want to date, if you don't reply your uninterest is noted. You would be annoyed if they kept asking for clarification, wouldn't you?\" This after I emailed once after 3-4 weeks.",

But they needed to work out the schedule. Ok... no problem. I just need to know when to give current employer a 2 weeks notice. \n\nWaited 2 weeks, didn't hear anything back, so I called them to politely ask what's going on. I'm told (in a cheerful way) that he's working on it and he'll let me know soon. Alright...cool.  Waited another 2weeks and still silence. Once again, called them to politely ask what up. This time he's gruff and kinda pissy. Same line of bs about working on the schedule. Well, I didn't want to lose the job before I ever started, so I left it alone. Couple months go by and I discovered that they hired someone from their sister company. That's pretty dirty of them! \n\nMy revenge came a couple years later. They were opening a new store, actually closer to where I lived. Of course I applied to work there. The pay was significantly higher. Eventually the store opens. Yet I never heard a peep from them.  Not even a rejection email. I call up their corporate number to find out if they even saw my application. Nope. They say the store would have it on file. Call the store. Nope. Corporate would have it in their system.  By now I'm PO'd and ready for revenge. Called corporate back and gave them an earful. I let them know where I currently work and our customers often asked for advice on where to buy a suit. Told the rep that there was no way in hades I would ever recommend going to their store. In fact, I was going to advise men to stear clear of them and go to their competitors! She was a teeny bit panicked and was pleading with me not to do that. I abruptly ended with \"too late\" and requested that they burn my application. That is...should they ever find it  (highly doubtful).  \n\nYeah I know I dodged a bullet there.

It might have been a petty response, but they deserved it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I'm hiring, every single applicant that makes it to my desk gets a response. A lot of times, it's a boilerplate email. But once an applicant made it past a certain stage, a phone call (or if possible, a face-to-face meeting) is warranted, IMHO. I've had to tell existing coworkers that they weren't selected - you can put money that I brought them into my office and explained not only that they weren't selected, but *why*. \n\nWhile I have this response policy on a personal level, I did find out later that it's also a written policy at the company level, too. Needs better marketing; I'm not sure every manager knows that line is in there.\n\nGah, I hate ghosting managers. Pisses me off.",

It was the worst application I have ever seen in my life.\n\nBehind it was a copy of the rejection explaining we didn't have the job he applied to. He received a perfect, professional response for... THAT. I still don't know what to think about it.\n\nWhy can some companies do this and others not? Are they... Stupid? Or just cowards?",

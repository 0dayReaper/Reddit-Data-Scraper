    "postText": "So for a bit more back story I have another post about this guy. Let\u2019s just say this guy is one of those guys that has to wear Gucci and Prada and has to make sure you know it. He also looks like the type of guy that spends 2 hours in front of a mirror every morning. He is the only guy I ever seen pull out a mirror and comb from his pocket to make sure his hair was good. Themis guy checks his hair before getting out of the car everyday. \n\nNow before you think we are being mean to him because he is a peacock (that\u2019s how he got his nick name) it\u2019s not. We are mean to him because he parks like a jerk intentionally. He parked in front of one for the gates to my shop and tried to sue me for having him towed. He continued to do it till his car got hit. He than proceed to park on the grass of a different local business. I don\u2019t think that business owner ever looks on that side of his property ever. He stayed their till the owner of that property installed a guardrail to prevent people from hitting his business. That road is a hazard. \n\nSo what does Mr Peacock do? Park a little further away? No. Arrive a little earlier to find a good spot? Hell no. Pay for parking in the garage? The nerve of even asking. No he parks partially on the side walk in front of his business\u2026 ok no problem it doesn\u2019t affect me right? Well this guy is a prick. Him deciding to park the way he does means the road that as no parking for a reason becomes impassable. The police were called after a few days of this and his car was towed. \n\nNow Mr Peacock needed a new spot for his car. Enter him going full douche bag\u2026 actually I think we can declare him a douche ship at this point\u2026 he bought a Fiat 500 and would park it wherever it would fit. Even if it just barely fit. He would squeeze into spots that would make it impossible for others to get out. In a few times we wondered how he even got out of the car. So one day I assigned 3 guys to clean the yard and they hatched a plan. See these guys are usually the last ones to arrive and the employee lot gets filled before they get in. \n\nThey started cleaning by the fence of the yard. They set up cones on both sides of the fence with warning signs and started cleaning. When that red fiat finally rolled by they started up the pressure washer and as soon as Mr Peacock walked by he got hosed. The dude got completely drenched in seconds. I was so glad to be there that day, because to see someone wearing such expensive clothing and being completely drenched was absolutely glorious. He yelled about my guys and I asked him if he saw the signs and cones. He stormed out calling something very rude that involves a mother and another word that involves a donkey. Well firstly my name isn\u2019t jack or John, but I am an ass. Also when you have kids your automatically a mother f****r.\n\nEdit: I wrote this half drunk and it came out with a lot of typos and errors. I am not correcting any of them. Mr Peacock is not worth it.",

    "postText": "So, I don\u2019t know the full story, but I do know the just of it. My grandma raised her kids with love. She practically spoiled them, and she raised her grandkids too (Me and my two sisters). Two of them, my uncle and my dad, became addicts, and the last, my aunt, became estranged. I\u2019ve got tons of relatives, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever met her, if I have I don\u2019t remember her face or name, so let\u2019s call her little miss J.\n\nJ left without looking back, and constantly asked my grandmother for money. She hardly repaid Grandma, which was a big mistake, because, surprise surprise, my grandma was on top of every penny that she had. She was the best I\u2019ve ever seen when it came to handling funds.\n\nBut, two years ago, my grandma was diagnosed with cancer. She worked her butt off her whole life, was the strongest woman on the planet, and nobody got by without paying her their dues. Eventually, my grandma dies.\n\nIn her will, she gives money to my grandpa, my dad, my uncle, me, and my sisters. Everyone in her family.\n\nBut\u2026 when it comes to J, she says,\u201dYou still owe me 14 dollars.\u201d\n\nI do not know if she actually somehow debted J 14 dollars in a will, or just put it in there as a little slap in the face. All J was worried about when grandma died was the money, and she got NONE OF IT. I can\u2019t be prouder to have a grandma that wouldn\u2019t leave this world without the last laugh.\n\nEDIT: I guess I forgot to include it. J is also a drug addict, that\u2019s why she needed my grandmother\u2019s money constantly. My grandmother was a great woman, and a great mother to me. She raised me well.\n\nAND ANOTHER EDIT: (because people want to blame my grandmother) She raised 3 kids that were hers, and 3 kids that weren\u2019t. The kids that were hers turned into drug addicts, the 3 kids that weren\u2019t turned into people who could handle their emotions and found therapy for themselves. I think it was a generational problem rather than the \u201cbad parenting\u201d she\u2019s being accused of. She was the kindest woman I\u2019d ever met, but also the strongest. All 3 of us are getting therapy for things that aren\u2019t related to my grandmother. My uncle, my dad, and my aunt, are not. Do we not think that maybe the generational differences of people who were often not given needed resources, and people with the technology to find needed resources, might be a factor in how they handled their mental illnesses?\n\nLAST EDIT I\u2019LL MAKE AND IM NOT REPLYING TO ANYONE: I should\u2019ve expected the reddit community, notorious for being snobby and pompous, would react like this, but I still feel the need to clarify. NONE of you know my life simply from the paragraphs written here. I have a long history, and the memories of my grandmother are the only good ones I have. None of the drug addicts in my family, not my mom, not my dad, not my other grandma, not the aunt I do know, not my uncle, not ONE MEMBER OF MY FAMILY has spoken ill about how my grandmother treated her kids. In fact, they\u2019ve spoken highly of her parenting. It will be a cold day in hell when I let chronically online know-it-alls attempt to change my memory of my grandmother into something she was not. She was an honorable woman, and she is not responsible for the mistakes her children made when faced with an opioid crisis. I know that my dad was long out of the house before he got hooked on drugs, and he is now diagnosed with anxiety. If you\u2019d like to continue blaming my grandma, I\u2019d love to see how you believe she affected the other half of my family who was the same way. A leading cause of addiction is genetics, and mental and emotional disorders. Anxiety can be an inherited condition, that probably went untreated, as my grandmother was also a very anxious person. \n\nWhat I know is, my grandmother did not work her ass off to be a good person, just for a bunch of self-important prigs to insult her. Bottom line, you don\u2019t know my life, I do. This was a funny story because everyone in the family knows J is an asshole.",

A man was buried there near the end of the first summer I worked there who was still wearing a ring that was supposed to be removed before the casket was closed. The family had him exhumed so the ring could be recovered.\n\nI learned that, when this happened, it sometimes turned out the item hadn't been interred with the body, but had simply been \"misplaced\". What that really meant was that someone had stolen it. Funeral directors generally weren't complicit, but still tended to try to cover it up (because that would be bad for business).",

So I'd just do some upvotes, look at everyone's karma values, change upvotes to downvotes, and then see how much everyone's karma changes in those few seconds. The whole thing was just a handful of lines in python, too. And then I'd undo the downvotes, cause otherwise it'd be real obvious what I was doing XD\n\nI'd like to say I was doing it out of protest for the badly implemented handles thing, and warning people to not trust the anonymity provided by the app, but I was really doing it cause I was a bored nerd who needed to get out more.",

It opens up a way for that person to contest the will.  For example, \"i leave my daughter J nothing because she called me a twat.\"  J comes back, claims that she apologized to grandma on her deathbed and grandma forgave her, so the reason for not getting anything is no longer valid. Still an uphill battle for J but why even give her the opening?  Just write \"I specifically leave nothing to J\" and leave it at that. \n\nThe wills I've written just list the close relatives, the 'natural objects of one's bounty' and leave it at that. In my state, that is enough to thwart an attack on a will on the basis that the decedent lacked capacity to recognize their natural objects of affection edit: or was an accidental omission.",

If you want them to get nothing, specifically state you're leaving them nothing. If you want to give them something, but less than what they think they \"deserve\", leave them a non-insubstantial amount and add a contest clause. This especially works with beneficiaries who would not inherit through intestacy, since if they contest the will and lose - they don't receive the bequest, but if they contest and win - they get nothing at all.",

When you're raised in a family like that, your perception of the world, what's right and wrong, how people are supposed to act and treat each other, is so skewed it's practically delusional\n\nI didn't know I was emotionally abused and neglected until last year at 24 years old, since then I've realized that behaviors that I thought were normal, even funny, were literal abuse.\n\nI think it says a lot that this post is so popular and this comment chain isn't.  Since learning about my abuse/neglect, I've started to think that there are probably a lot of people on reddit, and online in general, who were abused and/or neglected and don't realize it.\n\nEspecially younger people, people who grew up on the internet.  I've been on reddit since I was 13ish.  Looking back, I spent practically all of my free time since I was 13ish on my computer.  In retrospect, that's because I was emotionally neglected by my parents.  I didn't spend any time with my dad.  We didn't play games or sports, we didn't talk about anything unless I was in trouble.  I basically just stayed in my room and kept to myself.\n\nTurns out, some parents talk to their kids?  They make their kids feel listened to and respected?  They find activities to do with their kids?\n\nInstead, some parents take the easy rode.  They think \"the kid's on the computer, he doesn't need anything from me.\" -- They essentially turn the computer into a baby sitter.",

She often contacted him and his partner to harass them or followed them around verbally abusing them, got them fired from multiple jobs, just made their life hellish. Despite that, my great uncle and his partner were a lovely men who always tried to find the silver lining and look on the bright side of life. I feel lucky to have known them.\n\nWhen my great uncle passed from cancer, he and his partner had managed to build a very successful business and had made quite a bit of money. My great aunt knew this and even though she was horrible to them, still somehow expected a big payday. To her somehow shock, my great uncle left everything to his partner and my grandparents except $5. That was for my great aunt so she couldn\u2019t contest the will by saying he\u2019d forgotten her, and the comment in his will for her was \u201cTo my baby sister Dot: I leave you $5.00.

If your estate is worth $13 Mil it pays taxes on $80k after you die. If you tried to game the system by giving your only heir $100k your Estate is now only worth $12.9k, but either you paid Gift tax on $84k ($100k-$16k) or you used your exclusion and now your Estate Tax kicks in lower.  The feds get roughly the same crack at your fortune regardless of how you plan it out.\n\nHowever let's say instead of doing $100k in one year you paid that $15k a year as a birthday Present. Six years of that there's no Estate tax and you avoided the gift tax by making it under $16k. Only problem with this sort of plan is knowing how much your various things are going to be worth when you die....",

However, my sister has been loaned a lot of money over the years and he has kept track of each and every dollar so that it would be deducted from her half in the will.\n\nMaybe your grandma had a similar outlook ?",

            "comment": "  My grandmother was a dual woman,  but she invested wisely.   She lived off my grandfather's estate after he passed &amp; had her own estate that she grew with her investing. \n\n  My cousin stole money &amp; jewelry from my grandmother &amp; then,  got into some serious trouble when he forged checks that he stole from his other grandfather. \n\n  He ran to Spain to avoid jail time.   My grandmother couldn't alter my grandfather's Will to cut my cousin out,  but she did remove him from her own will. \n\n  Then,  she went to work on \"gifting\" is money from my grandfather's estate for a few years before she passed, minimizing the amount he would inherit by a great deal. \n\n  Cousin hears she's passed &amp; decides to return to the states,  sourcing to inherit 1/3 of grandpa's estate &amp; 1/3 of grandma's estate.  Since his mother had already passed, he share went to him. \n\n  He flies in &amp; is taken into custody at the airport.   The executor of my grandfather's estate puts cousins money into an account while he's in prison.  \n\n  Cousin was shocked to learn that the money he'd inherited wouldn't cover his legal fees &amp; restitution.   He expected to inherit around $450,000.  By the time my grandmother had finished \"gifting\" money from that estate,  he inherited $23,000.  Ha!!  Nicely done,  grandma. \n\n  My uncle allowed him to live in my grandmother's home,  with the condition that he laid the mortgage.   It was only $400/ month.   Cousin lost that house to the bank for not paying the mortgage &amp; my sisters &amp; I bought it back from the bank using some of the \"gifted\" money.   Very cool old, BIG house up on the bank of a big river. \n\n  After he lost the house,  cousin bailed on his wife &amp; baby,  so,  she's living in that house rent free,  until the baby is 18.  He'd gotten married while in Spain &amp; didn't tell his wife that he had a warrant &amp; jail time waiting for him when they arrived at the airport.   She didn't even speak English &amp; had never met any of us.   He's a total POS.",

He never asked about the loans, but never forgot about them either. When he passed he made it a point that one of my sisters would take nothing from the estate. She never made a single payment to him.",

    "postText": "Please forgive my terrible spelling and grammar, I just suck at English. Also please forgive the formatting, I'm on mobile.\n\nFor a little back story, this all began 8 years ago when we first moved into our house. My neighbour who we promptly nicknamed Bitchface, instantly hated us. She hates children and at the time my kids were only 4 and 7 years old. She soon told the entire street we were awful people, isolating us from most from day one. Funny enough though, we've always gotten on with the neighbours in the house the other side of us without any problems.\n\n\nFast forward a couple of years, I love gardening, I love plants and pottering around, its great for my anxiety disorder. What's not so great for my anxiety is Bitchface. In my country a 2m fence is standard fence height but our fence which she claims is jointly owned between us is only 1.5m. She's constantly looking at me, pulling disgusted faces and making snarky comments (so much maturity for a 60 year old woman!) At this point I've had enough of her. We give her a choice, we either put up a trellis for a little more privacy on the existing fence or put a standard fence on our side of the existing fence that is 2m tall. She reluctantly chose the trellis. She claims a 2m fence would block the sunlight in her garden for sunbathing but I have been tracking the light levels into our gardens for years, it makes zero difference to her sunbathing.\n\n\nFast forward to a month ago. This fence She cares so much for, she hasn't touched in the 8 years we've been here, we've reinforced the posts on our side and supported it during storms as the posts are rotten, give it a few more storms at its going to break. Also at this point I have had evergreen shrubs slowly growing up infront of the fence and trellis for 6 years which she has never complained about, we wanted to add more but wanted to wait until the fence was sorted incase we needed to get to the fence for repairs.\n\n\nWe offered to fully pay for a brand new 2m fence. She threatened to go to the solicitors. We said fine, keep it, if it breaks she can deal with it. She thought that was the end of it and that she won. That was until yesterday when she saw two big 2m tall evergreen plants being delivered to our house. To say she was not best pleased would be an understatement. Bitchface stormed out into her garden, shouting over to my dad who was working on replacing our shed roof \"your not putting those plants in here are you!?\" All the while completely ignoring my husband and I who were preparing to put the first plant in. She then says to my dad how we are the nightmare neighbours who basically don't do what she wants (she thinks she's entitled to tell us where we can and can't put in our own garden!!!!)\nShe stormed back into her house all defeated. I was shaking with anger but it felt so good to finally get basic privacy while in my own garden that I very much needed.\n\nI'm a little worried what she may do next so just in case, I'm going to take regular photos of my plants, report any threats to my property and see if I can get any soil testing kits incase she tries to poison them.\n\n\nI hate that woman!",

    "postText": "Several years ago after a renovation we were awaiting cable internet connection. The local monopoly supplier (phone, cable internet, cable TV) were tardy with their appointments. You know the drill \"... a tech will arrive between 8am and 4pm - please be home...\" so I stay home from work, wait all day and come 4pm - no show.   \nSo I call up, wait on hold for 30 odd minutes. I am swiftly told the contractor will be there tomorrow and guess what ? \"... a tech will arrive between 8am and 4pm - please be home...\" So I stay home home again.   \nNo surprise same deal for 2nd appointment. So I call up and they book install for the following week. 3rd time luck of course he is a no show again.   \nSo I call up yet again to rebook. At the last minute I said \"... I have now taken 3 days off work - you should reimburse me for that and now there is a 4th day...\" so they transfer me off to some other department for another long hold time. \n\nEventually I get some lady explain all the deets and she say fair enough a claim is due. She says, may Iask you rate?\n\nme: \"sure - my rate is $680.\"\n\nher: \"OMG thats a lot of money for a day.\"\n\nme: \"Oh no I am SO sorry you misunderstood. Thats my hourly rate.\"\n\nher: silence. eventually ... \"ok I think I need to transfer you to a more senior representative.\"\n\nme: waiting on hold... guns loaded.\n\nthem: \"Hello mr so and so... My name is 'something un memorable' I amd hte Director of Customer Service. I undersatnd you are making a claim. Let me see.... may I ask what job you have that has such a high rate?\"\n\nme: \"Why yes of course. I am a Queens Council barrister specialising in coporate litigation...  \n\"\n\nher: silence. \"I am so sorry fo your trouble.... may I place you on hold for a moment?\"\n\nme: \"Of course\"\n\n5 mins later\n\nher: \"Again we are so sorry. I have just got off the phone and out contractor will be there within 30 minutes.\"\n\nme: \"Ok thats great... so what about my claim. let me see that is 3 days, 10 hours per day, $680/hr - lets just round it off shall we $20k it is.\n\nher: silence.... and then more silence. eventually. \"May I place you on hold?\"\n\nOn we went and at the end of the call I had free cable internet (top speed) full package cable TV and my measly $29/month phone bill. \n\nI scored 2 years of sweet free cable just for some shoot from the hip BS to the complaints department. Was easy in the 90's and not sure If I could pull it off now!",

Everything was normal for a few months until we decided to order a sports event on pay per view for $10.  When our bill came they somehow took $10 off our normal bill.  So we tried it again and got another $10 off.  After that we routinely watched enough pay per view to zero out our bill.  We did this for a couple years until we moved and somehow got away with it.",

It was very annoying and added to my work when something had to be redone. I was talking to a phone tech at work and they mentioned that call waiting would do that. So I checked my phone bill and yes there was a charge for call waiting on my work line. \n\nI called the phone company and complained. They tried to tell me I ordered it when they rolled the service out. I sarcastically replied that sure I ordered call waiting on a line that I only used to call out on for dial up access so my work could get interrupted regularly by random telemarketing calls. I asked them for proof that it was requested rather than just added, they couldn\u2019t provide it so the refund paid the phone bill for over a year. \n\nAnd yeah that was a long time ago, think 1200 BAUD.",

When the power came back on my roommate just decided to try the TV... we had cable. We did not know how, but it worked. \n\nSeveral months later, while I was at work, a cable guy knocked on the door asking if we were having trouble with the picture. A couple of the couch surfers were there and tried to fend him off but he leaned in to see the TV. He said it looked bad and he'd be right back. He left for a few minutes and came back saying, \"See, it looks better!\" The same thing happened a few months later.\n\nWe not only had free cable for about four years (until my wife and I bought a house and moved) but they came to fix, it twice, without asking.",

Then we had another face to face meeting and he said that we were the worst customer service case they had happened (so far) to that company, I said I never want to pay a fee ever again, and several other reimbursements - some internal staff were fired (for the theft).  \n\nThey asked me to come and do a talk to their customer service staff about what happens when things go horribly wrong. I said maybe in ten years when I calm down - I never did. \n\nIts now 24 years late - and this has made me slightly 'angry' even thinking about it again.",

They were trialling the service and had randomly selected 500 customers who were customers of both companies asking if they were interested in a 1 year trial . Can't recall the costs  but for about $5 extra month over the cost of the cable package I would get my mobile phone package , saving me about $30 a month so I signed up for the 1 year trial. It took them about 8 or 9 years to finally realise they'd forgotten about the 500 customers on the 1 year trial ; they duly gave us about 9 months further notice. In all those years both the cost of the cable tv package and the mobile phone package had risen but for reasons unknown both prices from the original trial offer were never increased",

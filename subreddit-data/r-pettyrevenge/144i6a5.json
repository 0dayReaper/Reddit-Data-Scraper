    "postText": "This happened a few years ago, I w used to play pool for a pub team and my nephew wanted to join (he was 19 at the time) so a few of us would show up a few hours early at the pub to get a good few games in to sharpen up ready for our league game. \n\nThere was about 5 or 6 of us in the pool room at the time, I had just bout a fresh pint of Pepsi (don\u2019t drink kn a work night) and decided to nip off to the toilet. So my nephew decides he wants to dip his penis and testicles into my drink.\n\nNow I have a nose for when someone tries to play a prank on me and knew something was up as everyone went silent and one or two were smirking. I look at my mate as pick my drink up and he shakes his head slightly. I pipe up ok, who has fucked with my drink, the lads start laughing. \n\nJonny says in my ear it was my nephew and to not drink it. After a bit of pressing he tells me what he did. So I remind him that I may be fat like an elephant, but like an elephant I never forget  and you will.( I\u2019m chubby btw not fat ) cue a fortnight later and the nephew strolls in with a large bottle of energiser energy drink, puts it down by the pool table and disappears to the toilets\u2026 cue my revenge.\n\nI grab the bottle and disappear behind the pool table, whip my trousers and pants down and rubbed the bottle neck between the cheeks of my ass ( I had showered after getting home from work and the pub was hot so I was a little sweaty), popped the top back on and pulled my trousers back up and put the bottle back just in the nick of time, nephew walks in opens the bottle, puts his lips around the neck of the bottle and downs the lot. \n\nBoth me and Jonny laughed so hard as he did it. The nephew then asked what we was laughing at to which I reminded him of me telling him he would forget and also asked how my arse tasted. \n\nTo this day he has never tried to pull another prank on me.\n\nEdited to keep those who like paragraphs happy.\nAlso as some may feel this is gross, sick or vulgar etc. your welcome to your opinion. My thought process in doing this back to him was if you think that your funny doing that to me, I can put do you so you never fuck with me again. Which he has not. \nI know it is a vulgar and horrible thing to do but in my eyes it taught my nephew a lesson, one which he will never forget. Don\u2019t mess with uncle Dan \ud83d\ude09",

The prank, the intention, was still there, everyone was waiting for OP to drink it without saying anything and only his mates stopped that from happening. It's just unlucky(or planned, OP was covert about his own revenge) that nephew didnt have the same back up. Just to add that the OP's friend might know that if he didnt say anything and just let him drink the cockwater, he would be on the receiving end of a revenge prank as well as the nephew.",

One of the senior petty officers in my division warned me about it in general terms so I spotted it when it went down. I was on watch one evening as engineering officer of the watch (EOOW) when someone said, \u201cYou want some coffee, sir?\u201d. Yeah, sure - cream and sugar. A couple grins and smirks are exchanged and someone goes for the coffees. A whole box of coffees come back, with one lonely cup standing off to the side which is handed to me, accompanied by more side-eyed smirking. So, OK, something\u2019s up. I put the cup on the corner of the hinge-top EOOW\u2019s desk and keep myself busy with whatever. After a minute I open the desk to get something inside and - oh, shucks! - the coffee flies off and hits the deck. I grabbed some paper towels, mopped it up, and tossed the mess in the trash. Some disappointed looks are exchanged between the people clustered around the board. I don\u2019t know precisely what had been done to that cup of coffee but I knew I wasn\u2019t drinking it\u2026",

            "comment": "Now with paragraphs (thank you ChatGPT):\n\nThis happened a few years ago. I used to play pool for a pub team, and my nephew wanted to join (he was 19 at the time). So a few of us would show up a few hours early at the pub to get a good few games in, to sharpen up and get ready for our league game.\n\nThere were about 5 or 6 of us in the pool room at the time. I had just bought a fresh pint of Pepsi (I don't drink on a work night) and decided to nip off to the toilet.\n\nSo my nephew decides he wants to dip his penis and testicles into my drink. Now, I have a nose for when someone tries to play a prank on me, and I knew something was up as everyone went silent and one or two were smirking. I look at my mate as I pick my drink up, and he shakes his head slightly.\n\nI pipe up, \"Okay, who has messed with my drink?\" The lads start laughing. Jonny says in my ear that it was my nephew and advises me not to drink it. After a bit of pressing, he tells me what he did.\n\nSo I remind him that I may be chubby, not fat like an elephant, but like an elephant, I never forget.\n\nCue a fortnight later and the nephew strolls in with a large bottle of Energiser energy drink, puts it down by the pool table, and disappears to the toilets.\n\nCue my revenge. I grab the bottle and disappear behind the pool table, whip my trousers and pants down, and rub the bottle neck between the cheeks of my ass (I had showered after getting home from work, and the pub was hot, so I was a little sweaty). I pop the top back on, pull my trousers back up, and put the bottle back just in the nick of time.\n\nNephew walks in, opens the bottle, puts his lips around the neck of the bottle, and downs the lot. Both Jonny and I laugh so hard as he does it.\n\nThe nephew then asks what we were laughing at, to which I remind him of me telling him he would forget and also ask how my ass tasted.\n\nTo this day, he has never tried to pull another prank on me.",

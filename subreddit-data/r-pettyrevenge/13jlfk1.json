    "postText": "So I (19M) work in the meat dept of a natural market. Today I had a customer come in while I was stocking the self-serve case. My other guys were busy so I asked if she needed help. She said \"No I need a professional opinion\" in a rude tone. I just kinda shrugged and let it go, and called another guy over.\n\nA fee mins later she came over and asked if I knew where the pasta sauce was. I said \"no ma'am I work in the meat dept. not grocery.\"\n\nThe look she had on her face. I'm not sure if I can physically describe it. But it was pure bliss for me",

Still most of the people who came into the shop and were greeted by her said:\u201d oh I need your husband to make a key\u201d, and walked straight to him, while he was repairing shoes, disturbing him in his work. He shut down his machine, listen to the client, had a very good look at the key, and even if he could copy it, he would always say: I have to ask my wife I don\u2019t know this key. \ud83e\udd23",

The department manager was a woman named Pat who had been there 10+ years and knew her stuff. People would be looking like they were perplexed, and Pat would dutiously ask if they needed help with something. They'd tell her no, she walked away. One of the male associates approached later and customers would accept their help. Except, there would be something the associate didn't know or needed Pat's help. So, the associates all would say \"let me get the  manager. HEY PAT!\" And the customers always had a gobsmacked expression when the first person who asked how they could help  but rebuffed comes up and handles the situation in 30 seconds. Pat took care of her department associates and all the guys were 100% supporive of her. They also would intentionally \"not know\" something so they could call Pat over to \"solve the problem' and quietly thunk the sexist derps on the forehead.",

Staff get into trouble for saying \u2018I\u2019m not sure\u2019 and getting a colleague to help? \n\nI\u2019ve never experienced that, or heard of that as a rule. \n\nBut I\u2019ve read enough stories on here about horrible workplace experiences to imagine that what you\u2019re saying is probably true for some places. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m talking about on a smaller scale. Like if I go to the shop and ask about a product, the people that wear the uniform should know where it is, whether they stock it, OR how to search for the info on the computer if they don\u2019t know. \n\nAnd in huge warehouse type stores with many sections, you can grab an employee, ask about the product, and they\u2019ll send you to the right section for help - because they don\u2019t know as they aren\u2019t trained. \n\nFor example, the deli in a grocery store is a separate business, even though it\u2019s in the same building\u2026 the deli people work in the deli, not the store. If I get my meat from them and then ask \u2018where\u2019s the milk\u2019, they might not know. They might direct me to a floor employee. And that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable good customer service response. \n\nSimilarly, if I ask a floor employee if the deli stocks a certain type of meat, they genuinely might not know. But they would tell me where the deli is located and tell me who to talk to. Very reasonable. \n\nI\u2019ve read about the crazy Karen types who won\u2019t accept \u2018I can\u2019t help because that\u2019s not my section, but let me get you the right employee to help you\u2019 - but that\u2019s not reasonable. That\u2019s just stupid! \n\nI never want to be one of them - if an employee says they can\u2019t help me and that I need to go and talk to someone else (this person or this is where you will find them), I believe them.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of trust I was talking about.",

There was this one lady that would always ask if what you were stocking was fresh. One day she asked if the eggs I was stocking were fresh, I told her I had no idea when the chicken laid them. Unbelievably one time I was stocking blocks of cheese and she asked me if that was fresh. I said no ma'am, that is why it say AGED on the package. She used to piss me off, LOL.",

And your \"revenge\" could have stalled her enough for her to suddenly remember to pick up another item she would've forgotten while looking for the sauce. That sometimes happens to me the longer I'm in a shop looking for something, I suddenly remember I need something else.\n\nThe worst you did was likely waste two minutes of her time so sorry to piss on your bonfire, but it's not the \"win\" and \"revenge\" you think it is.

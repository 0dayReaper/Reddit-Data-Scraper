    "postText": "Small story, but wanted to gloat. So my employer is as per the title, crappy and the bosses are all round terrible humans who are out for their own profit. Since I\u2019ve been there they have been really awful with me about basically everything, I won\u2019t go into it but they deserve nothing but a shower of sh*t headed their way. \n\nSo\u2026 the company has decided it needs to actually comply with the law here and have first aiders in the offices we have. Nobody wants to do it, as it\u2019s a three day course which is paid for by the office, and we\u2019re all busy, but the office is kind of desperate so they\u2019ve offered travel expenses and food costs etc (usually they wouldn\u2019t). It\u2019s also a pretty expensive course to undertake for the practice, but it\u2019s mandatory and without a first aider available on site they can get fined. Usually this position would be filled by an administrator who doesn\u2019t charge out for their professional services by the hour, but they\u2019re idiots who got rid of their admin teams as much as possible during covid.\n\nCue petty revenge. I have signed up to undertake the training. I\u2019ll have three days off work, learn a valuable skill and cost the company three days of charging for my services plus my expenses for attending the  course, and the course fee itself. It\u2019s a lot of money for them to pay basically. Little do they know I\u2019ll be moving abroad at the end of the year so they\u2019ll have to do this all again for someone else or be fined in January for not having a valid first aider. \n\nIt\u2019s a small win, but a win for me nonetheless.\n\nEdit: queue to cue for people with pet peeves.",

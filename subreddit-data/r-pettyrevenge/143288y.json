            "comment": "I had people see me and my son come out of one of the offices on the top floor of an office building, we had a small drag laptop case/briefcase cart (almost a suitcase, for teachers and students) with us, so the stairs weren't a good option. The elevator door opened, they scooted in, and pressed buttons to make sure the door closed before we could enter or stop the elevator. This particular elevator is slow, and there's only 1. So we had to wait.\n\nThe women stood outside, right in the way on the stairs. As we walked around them, I said to my son \"So, kindness and courtesy, that was taught in what? Kindergarten, right?\"  \n\n\n\\*  My son drags the case, it's his, and he's slower. So now if I see someone at the elevator, I run for it, and tell him to hurry. I have yet to see those women again, but when I do, I won't tell him to hurry, instead, I will hold the open elevator button for however long it takes.",

    "postText": "I'm pretty short for a guy, 5'5 ft or 1m65. At the time of this event I was in college, we had a class about how we were supposed to deal with agression, both instrumental agression and emotional agression. FYI emotional agression is as the name indicated agression coming from emotions like anger or grief. Instrumental agression is agression used as a tool to reach a certain goal, it's manipulative and insidious.\n\nMost of it was practical exercises where one student had to act as the agressor and the other as the one handling the agressor. In this exercise I had to pretend to be the agressor while the other student (let's call him A) had to be the victim while trying to get me to leave the premises. There are certain tactics for this like starting out polite and getting increasingly less polite until eventually the victim keeps yelling \"GET OUT!\" which is usually where the agressor stops and actually gets out.\n\nA was taller than me by at least 20 cm (7 inches). While we were doing the exercise he laughed and mocked me saying sorry but he could never be intimidated by such a small guy like me. I was trying pretty hard to come over as agressive but all he did was laugh. \n\nIt felt pretty humiliating, just do the exercise please even if you have to play along. \n\nCouple of months later we have to do our exam and I get paired up with the same guy, again I am the agressor using instrumental agression, the situation is that I'm smoking in a non-smoking area whereas he is the safety advisor trying to get me to leave. \n\nOOOH BOY, it's payback time. In a normal situation I have to act up a bit and then leave after tactics are used but I felt like simulating real life just a tiny bit more. This is how the exam went while other students and the teacher watched:\n\nA: Excuse me Sir but you're not allowed to smoke in this parking lot, please put out the cigarette.\n\nMe: Nah.\n\nA: Again, it's against the rules to smoke here, I advise you to leave.\n\nMe: Advise all you like boy\n\nA: I'm telling you to leave now.\n\nMe: \\*Yawns and pretends to ignore him while smoking a fictitious cigarette\\*\n\nA: Get out.\n\nMe: \\*chuckles and keeps smoking\\*\n\nA: GET OUT!! (this is where the scenario usually ends)\n\nMe: \\*Starts walking towards him and blows fictitious smoke in his face and see him get flustered\n\nA: GET OUT!\n\nMe: \\*Walk back towards my smoking spot and continue smoking\\*\" \"Just because you're yelling now doesn't mean anythings changed.\"\n\nA's face is beet-red by now and he's visibly shaking from nervousness (it's still an exam after all and he's at a loss)\n\nA: \\*With trembling voice\\*  If you don't leave I'm going to call the police.\n\nMe: \\*Cool as an icecube\\* Go ahead, few more puffs and my cig is finished anyway. \n\nA: \\*Pretends to call the police\\*\n\nMe: Welp, I'm done, see ya dumbass. \n\nSCENARIO END\n\nVisible relief on A's face and that of the surrounding students who thought it was all a bit too intense. \n\nA walks up to me complaining that I dragged it out too long, respond by telling him things don't always play out the way you've learnt them in class.\n\nTeacher agreed with what I said and follows up by saying that the important thing was that I left even if his actions didn't have that much impact on me. He still did everything by the book so it's not like he failed his exam which wasn't my intention either. \n\nI just wanted to give him a hard time because shorties are people too, jackass. \n\nTLDR: Fellow student calls me short so I make him tremble.",

Of course, when you take the curls out, it's 6 inches past.  It's usually hiding under a palm or felt cowboy hat. Hawaii or button up outside work shirt, short sleeve. Blue jeans and steel toe boots.\n\nWhy am I underestimated? I usually have a fixed blade fighting knife on my left hip. Many don't notice.  Why you should never underestimate someone based on looks? I carry an M1911A1 45 with 7 extra magazines or a PT-92 9mm with 3 extra magazines under my shirt. As well as a pair of 45 Derringer pistols, one in each boot.\n\nHaving said that, 3 things.\n\n1. I am licensed to carry and do extra training. I try to do extra training every year, at a minimum.\n2. I do everything I can to not put myself in situations where I would need to change from my normal self to one who will voraciously defend myself, my family, my friends and anyone else that needs it. My normal is to be as peaceful as possible.\n3. No. I am not scared of anything.\n4. Love my hair and being an ex-ginger. Started going grey 10 years ago. I'm 53.  You can still see the red and some black in my beard, but ya gotta be up close. One of my old bus students, the only way to calm him down was to let him touch my beard.  As he got near his graduation, it was requested to stop this method before he made it into the real world.\n6. No. I don't carry at school. Still not allowed, but working on changing that aspect. Texas does allow teachers and staff to be armed, but there is quite a bit of extra training.\n\n\n\nTo each their own. \n\nP.S. Call your hubby Fuzzy and see if he gets the reference.",

Nobody in the recorded history of the family has ever been under a minimum of 5'3. (And we're all wondering how the hell my brother hit 6'2 as nobody in the recorded history reached 6 foot before.)  \n\n\nI don't mind being short; it's just that it come with comments about my weight (I barely eat, sweat like a whore in church, and walk everywhere; short of wiring my jaw shut...) and in recent years, I've gotten some facial scarring because I developed epileptic fainting spells. So, people notice all the bad or different things about me and are constantly pointing them out.  \n\n\nI had a friend tell me that I should never remove my mask (I work healthcare part time) because my face would scare people. My boss saw the scars and went \"Oh is that all?\" And then proceeded to tell my coworkers/clients that if anybody said anything about my face, they'd be canned/dropped in about 10 seconds. (Nobody has said anything and most of them wouldn't; several of my coworkers have visible differences they're worried about.) And my mom literally knocked the crap out of one of her now-ex-friends because he saw my face when the wounds were fresh and made a joke about me using \"substances\".",

By cutting them off and keep yelling get out before they even have a chance to say anything you let them know that their shit is not going to work on you.\n\nIt's not to be used on emotionally agressive people because that would only make things worse. For emotional agression they taught us to let them rage it out while showing empathy and understanding for their frustration.

I have a strong voice and don't even need a mike in medium size crowds, everyone can hear it, so on a one to one even with just a little force my voice can intimidate. Truth be told I do not like being aggressive and it takes a bit for me to switch from passive but when I do, people know it.",

It\u2019s a family business, our dads are leadership team. When I first started poor Tom\u2019s DAD, the CEO, came to me and asked if I had any single friends that I might introduce to his son bc he was having a hard time meeting anyone and he wanted to be a father one day and just turned 40. He asked me to help him fix his online dating profile!!! I felt so bad for Tom bc I\u2019d be so embarrassed if the reverse happened to me. Anyways time goes on and Tom warms up to me (I\u2019m married so just work friends) and I am amazed at how freakin smart and kind and accomplished this guy is. He eventually asked me to help him with his online profile which was so sad bc it like long form talked about him being a short dude. I made him delete that, spiffed up the rest and he got a date lined up like a week later. A year later, Tom is dating and will prob marry that same girl Allie, an amazing, equally smart 5\u201910\u201d BEAUTY who is always in heels. Now we\u2019re all couple friends and she doesn\u2019t give a shit about his height bc it doesn\u2019t fucking matter. I hate that my poor friend was so self conscious till meeting her though. Side note our latest hire is literally a 6\u20197\u201d former linebacker lol we\u2019re quite the size diverse team.",

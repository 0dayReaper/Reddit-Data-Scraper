    "postText": "How I got my revenge on a pervert.\n\nEdit: Written on a phone, not a native English speaker, and have ADD.\n\nEdit 2: Typos, grammar.\nBecause these questions/remarks have been asked/made several times in the comments:\n\n- I'm a freelance massage therapist and use an online booking system. It doesn't allow me to block clients from using it. And I can't always see who's next if it's booked at the last minute and I'm busy in a session. And honestly, I wouldn't let someone with little to no regrets come back if it was not with the idea to punish them.\n\n- I'm 6'1\" and 185lbs, not a small girl. So I can definitely protect myself physically. (The guy is a head shorter than me and overweight. That doesn't excuse his behaviour. It might change your perception of a young girl being abused by a bigger guy)\n\n- Unfortunately, a lot of massage parlours in my town offer extra services. So I guess they just try and see if they can get something.\nI don't know if they don't want to be labelled as erotic places. Or if it helps their customers to have these services discreetly. (My guess is that some customers who need sexual services can't just ring up the businesses and ask if they'll give them a wank, or risk being seen entering such a place).\n\n\nThis story is about my petty revenge on a customer who touched me inappropriately the last time I saw him.\n\n\nFor context:\n\n- I give massages and live in a warm country where people often hug people they know as a form of greeting. This client often flashes his Johnson and 'scratches' it when I'm giving him a massage. \ud83e\udd22 I usually pretend not to see it and carry on with my work.\n\n\n- The last time he hugged me before leaving the massage parlour, he got a little too close to me (rubbing his crotch on mine) and allowed his hands to find their way down to my bottom... (I was furious, but remained professional and pushed him out)\n\n\n\nSo let's start with the petty revenge:\n\n\n- My guess was that he'd be behaving inappropriately and that his groin/adductors would be the area to focus on. So I got my strongest type of Tiger Balm and used it on the adductors as the first thing when he got on the bed.\n\n\n- Here's what happened:\n\nas expected, he went down there several times with his hand and spread the ointment over his \"jewels\". This thing literally feels like pepper spray when it's applied to the thin skin (neck, armpits, bikini area and genitals)... (People who eat chilli know they should NOT go to the toilet or rub their eyes after cutting it! And it's the same kind of thing that happens).\nAnd he did it to himself! I was laughing inwardly like a psycho when it happened! I just gave him some wipes to clean himself up and told him to stop rubbing it in as his hands were full of the balm and he'd be rubbing it in even more!\n\n\nI hope the message was clear and he won't abuse me in the future or I'll add some Tabasco to the massage oil too!",

And (please don't be offended, this is not meant to be hurtful) better information because the piercing tells me you're not well informed about migraines. But the cooling effect of mint can make it more bearable, especially when you can't use an ice pack like in school. What I use is Euminz. It's mint oil in alcohol and comes in a little glass container. The top of the container is a sponge with a click system. You screw off the lid, press the sponge to your skin until it clicks, then rub it over your forehead, temples etc. I like it because it's easy to carry and to use, I enjoy the minty smell and the combination of mint oil and alcohol is super cooling and refreshing.",

I've seen a neurologist for over 15 years, worked migraine study with her through our local nationally accredited college for the medical field. I have suffered from these since puberty, and have done almost every treatment under the sun! (I say almost because I'm sure there are ones I haven't heard of.) I hit the point of hitting a level 8 migraine 5 or more days of the week 52 weeks of the year. I say that so you'll know I got the piercings as a \"can't make it worse\" last ditch effort.\n\nAs for the piercings, they do work. They work off of permanent accurpressure. Hence it being a piercing.\n\nMenthol, or mint, opens up sinus and airways and allows for better oxygenation, and it helps dilate the veins in the body. It's also a calming soothing scent for the body and mind.  Mint does not work for everyone, and even can trigger a migraine in some people. I never said Mint \"cures\" a migraine. I said it can help with the pain. You contradicted yourself by saying mint doesn't give any pain relief, followed by naming a product that is made up of mint and rubbing alcohol, and said that it helps! You'll argue back saying you stated it doesn't offer pain relief. And I will respond by saying you stated \"it makes it more bearable\" which is what minimal (pain) relief, or \"more tolerable\" means sweetheart.",

Since I'm too lazy to look up English versions of the proof that it can't work I'll try to show you by making you think about it. So please tell me how exactly a piercing influences genetic condition that affects the way brain cells work. How does it lead to the energy balance that's nessecary to prevent attacks? How does it prevent overstimulation from exhausting brain cells? How does it stop pain neurotransmitters from being released? How does it stop inflammation neurotransmitters from being released? How does it stop the walls of the arteries in the meninges from inflaming? How does it stop the nervus trigeminus or nervus occipitalis from sending pain signals to your consciousness? How does it prevent from neurotransmitters involved in the process of a migraine from docking on their station and giving the information of that leads to the migraine? If the piercing doesn't do any of these it literally can't prevent a migraine attack or reduce it's effects. And if you are as well informed about migraine as you claim to be you know all this",

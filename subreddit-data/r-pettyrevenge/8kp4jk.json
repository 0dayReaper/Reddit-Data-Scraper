    "postText": "I was at a gas station putting air in my tire. This gas station required you to pay $1.00 but came with a pressure gauge. The gas station across the street had free air but no gauge. As I\u2019m filling my tires a lady pulls up beside me and starts asking questions like how much it was to use, how much time, etc. I answered her questions as best I could but really was more focused on filling my tires since there was a time limit. My car has annoying warning lights that let you know if a tire is low, even the spare, and I hate when these sensors are lit up. The lady is still waiting there and is getting visible annoyed. This lady yells out, \u201cwill you hurry up! I\u2019m in a rush!\u201d I was confused for a second but quickly realized that she just wanted to use my time without paying. I did what any gentleman would do and proceeded to move slower. I pulled out of the spot and into a gas pump. She almost hit my car swooping in to where my car was. She jumps out and as she puts the air pump to her tire it shuts off. I guess I was smiling way too big because as she jumped into her car and sped off she yells \u201cfuck you\u201d at me. I was so pleased with how it all timed out I didn\u2019t even care. Such a great moment. ",

I'm a dumb shit. I had filled the syringe with air in preparation to drawing from the vial (you have to pump air in equal to the amount of liquid you're going to take out, otherwise you create a vacuum and it's much harder to draw), but *I had never actually drawn from the vial*. Cue panicked call to the nurse's hotline, where they reassured me that a) injecting air into your muscle isn't that serious, and my body would be able to break down/absorb it without damage, and b) when someone gets an IV hooked up, the entire length of tubing connected to the bag is full of air, which goes straight into a vein, so if *that* is safe enough to be done on a daily basis at every hospital everywhere, the .5ml of air in my thigh wasn't anything to worry about.",

If you have a slow leak, you can still drive on your regular tire till you can get it repaired.\n\nI have this one, and it's great:\n\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-12-Volt-Inflator-HD12A/203356023",

There are two states that are required by law to provide free air to their paying customers during business hours (CA and CT) but they often don't advertise that fact. I mean, as an unscrupulous business owner, why would you? Under-inflated tires lead to higher fuel consumption (and blow outs). So, rather than have the consumer's safety in mind, I guess they'd rather make a buck. \n\nAt least it's still just a buck in some places...\n\n",

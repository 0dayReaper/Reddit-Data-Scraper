    "postText": "When I was a preteen/teen I was horribly bullied. It didn\u2019t matter where I went, because I lived in a small town. School, church, the library. It took me a long time to grow into myself and embrace my weird. I\u2019m about to turn 40 so this was a long time ago. \n\nThis story involves the church bullies, who made me dread Sunday school, church, VBS, and Confirmation class. \n\nWhen I was 13, after 3 years of intense bullying, we were all in Confirmation class. Our class took a trip to some kind of retreat, and for reasons unknown not only was there a Ouija board there, but the pastor participated. This also doubles as the one and only time I have and will ever use one. \n\nMy bullies asked me to play Ouija with them, as they were buttering me up to try to catch me off guard. And in that moment a truly evil plan hatched in my angry teen brain. So I said sure. \n\nAnd then I moved the planchette. \n\nThey wanted to know stuff about their futures, so I moved the planchette to tell them they would die young in a car accident.\n\nAs we all do, they kind of laughed it off and went on their merry way. \n\nThe very next day, they come to me pale and shaken, and ask if I moved the planchette. Of course not, I said, why do you ask?\n\nTurns out they walked down the road to a gas station for candy and the three of them nearly wound up roadkill. At least to hear them tell it. \n\nI never fessed up, and I\u2019m sure these three women always have that little fear every time they see a car because of that Ouija board session. And I did it on purpose, knowing that would be the outcome, because I will get revenge, and you\u2019ll never know, and it will be as long-lasting as my psychological scars. \n\nI just happened to have a coincidental event that I could use to back up what the \u201cspirit\u201d said, and I chose to let them believe they were doomed. I could\u2019ve come clean and said it was a joke, but I chose to lie and make their temporary fear permanent. \n\nAnd I honestly don\u2019t feel any guilt.",

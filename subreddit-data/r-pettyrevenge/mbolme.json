    "postText": "\nI had a neighbor that had a dog that I shit you not, barked from bout 7pm til 5am NON STOP. They worked nights I believe. They kept it outside. I knocked numerous times, and they said: \"Dogs bark, what do you expect?\"\n\nTheir house was directly behind mine, we shared a divided wall. I recorded their dog for a full day. The minute they brought him in, and felt like they were sleeping, I popped my phone into the dock and played it on my stereo full blast facing their yard at 9am. \n\nThey came over raving mad to my wall by about 12, asking me to shut my dog up. I said \"Its your dog, I recorded him, since you miss out on what dogs do. I'm just playing the radio at normal allowable city time and I will do this everyday.\"\n\nThey started bringing the dog in at night after that.",

Apparently they were oblivious, or it didn't bother them or something because the dog never ceased even a little bit. This was back when people knew their neighbors (probably the 60's or early 70's), so granny had their phone number (no caller ID either). She would wait until about 3am and then call them and go \"BARWAWAWAWAWAWAWA!!\" into the phone and then hang up. She did this for 2 nights. 3rd night, the dog was taken inside and she never heard it again",

When we went to bed my wife said call the neighbor I said no I will call in the morning she was a nurse and worked at 7am .. I called 3 nights in a row at 430am and never had an issue again.. When you can't go back to sleep shit gets real. Her bedroom was on the other side of the house..",

I went and drove down to the clinic and demanded an abortion, and do you know the called the po-lice on me? Now that don't seem fair at all, cousin Mavis can get one but they won't let me.

The female was really, really loud. It took us maybe three minutes of listening to her to figure out that they were a) both married to other people and b) having an affair. It was really cringey. There were only four other tables seated at the time but a quick recon showed they were all discomforted by the couple's conversation. \n\nMy dad leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a meandering monologue, gradually increasing in volume. \"Yeah, that's the hard part of 4x4s. Tt's really tough to get dead squirrels out of the tire treads, but what can ya do? It's neat how they get reallllll long and realllll wide and their eyes bug out...\" My mom tried to slide under the table from pure embarrassment. My sister and I listened raptly to our dad talking about roadkill, fighting the impulse to bust out laughing. \n\nThe loud female left after about five minutes of this, followed by her visibly relieved male companion. The waitress gave my dad free pie.",

It\u2019s either going to be a smaller, couple unit building or a small house or something. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like people or am a hermit or curmudgeon, or not used to it (grew up in NYC), but I just can\u2019t take people\u2019s total disregard and inconsideration for everyone else any more. \n\nPeople let their dogs bark nonstop. I swear my neighbor\u2019s dog start barking the second leaving my apartment even crosses my mind. They don\u2019t pick up after them, whether it\u2019s in the dog park or in the damn stairwell. Couple of weeks ago, a dog was clearly sick and had an accident in the stairwell. The smell got so bad, you couldn\u2019t even open the stairwell door and the person never cleaned it up - pretty sure maintenance finally did. I have dogs of my own, I can sympathize, but I also make sure they aren\u2019t a nuisance to anyone but myself. \n\nPeople park their massive pickup trucks spilling in the spot next to it. Or they don\u2019t pull up all the way so you have to 10 point turn into the spot (try parking between you giant trucks or a truck and a concrete pole). \n\nApparently they steal shit. Haven\u2019t had it happen personally, but someone had a tiny Christmas tree outside their door for the holidays and the next day it was gone. \n\nGah, rant over, I needed that.",

She still has pretty bad separation anxiety and will howl when I leave if she\u2019s feeling malicious, but we\u2019ve definitely made significant progress. At some point, the dog\u2019s behavior is the human\u2019s fault. You need to at least be actively working on making your dog behave.",

My friends dog is the quietest little man - she googled how to keep him from being a barking dog in the beginning and stuck to it. My roommate, on the other hand, think \"dogs bark, they're dogs \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\". We live in a condo building, the condo above ours is currently empty. I told her if anyone ever moves in they're gonna hate her. She said \"I have a dog, they should know what they're getting in to.\" She thinks it's hilarious when he barks, because he's small. She barks at him to get him to bark when they're playing. Now he barks whenever I come home at night (anywhere from 10PM to 1:30AM) and she's annoyed/wondering why he always wakes her up. \nSorry for the rant, I'm super frustrated lol.",

And, she would only bark one or two times, to let them know that she was watching them. My neighbors(on both sides), however, have dogs that literally bark non-stop. Two corgis on the side, and three yappy ass litttle mutts in front. After about a year of us being outside listening to all the other dogs bark at absolutely nothing, she has started to pick up the habit. I have been working as hard as I can to stop her, but she still will bark at random times now. It is soooo annoying!! Because for the first year I had her, she probably barked 10-15 times total. Now, every other time we are outside, she will bark until I get her calmed down. And that takes a good 30 seconds.",

Two sleep in kennels at night or when we leave, and the outside dog stays in a 10x10 kennel when we are not home or at night. The outside dog only barks when she sees a squirrel. I believe the issue is typically separation anxiety. I think you are confusing people who just leave a dog outside and don\u2019t work with it, versus people who train their dogs. Either way my dogs are all comfortable alone. In fact, and if you work with dogs you probably know this, a lot of people who wear their heart on a sleeve for a dog, tend to over stimulate their dogs and reinforce disruptive, stressful, and anxious behavior.",

My two year old and I couldn\u2019t go play outside because they would bark and jump at the fence. Taking out our trash riled them up to the point both dogs were trying to scale the fence. They were large dogs, they looked like golden retrievers, but looked SO mean at the same time and I\u2019ve never seen a golden retriever look that mean. They impeded bed time, nap time, my son was barking around the house because it\u2019s all he heard throughout the day. I called and called and told animal control and the cops how miserable it was that we couldn\u2019t go outside without the dogs barking. They kept blowing me off until I recorded the dogs barking for nearly 2 hours non stop. I don\u2019t mean like 6 barks in an hour type of thing, I mean like 6 breaks in the barking. Non stop for two hours. I sent it to them and they finally sent someone out. They gave them a warning but they never brought their dogs inside. I figured they probably didn\u2019t pay too much attention to the recordings I sent, so I sent the first two hour one, then clipped the same video by 15-ish minutes every day and sent it again complaining again. Finally someone came out and talked to them and then talked to me. The animal control officer said that when she knocked on the door, she felt the vibrations of the two dogs barking inside the house. When she asked the neighbors why they don\u2019t bring the dogs in when they bark, the neighbors wife said \u201cThey are so loud, we don\u2019t want them to be in the house.\u201d\n\nLike bitch are you kidding me?

Me and another neighbor complained enough that animal control brought it to court and subpoenaed us as witnesses. The guy was a lawyer and told me he would never follow the judges orders and would make sure I\u2019m up every morning at 4am. He also told some neighbors I tried to poison his dogs (obviously untrue) and those neighbors still have a beef with me. \n\nThe lawyer and those neighbors tried to dispute the claims in court. Judge told him to keep his dogs inside from 10pm to 7am and he actually kind of followed the order. Well fast forward about a year. He filed bankruptcy and lost his house and law license. I learned a couple months ago he killed himself. The neighbors he recruited by saying I poisoned his dogs have since sprayed poison on my garden, cut down one of my trees, and consistently throws trash in my yard. \n\nLong story short, I will always remain anonymous when complaining about neighbors.",

She bought a kennel and was keeping them outside for that entire time a while ago, but the barking was so loud and constant that the literal entire town could hear them. Someone complained to our landlord and she no longer leaves them in the kennel. Instead, they're all inside her tiny apartment, where only we can hear them. They wake me up at 4am every single morning, and go off intermittently throughout the day. I have a spare phone that used to be for work, and before we went out of town for several days, I propped my phone against the wall and hit record. Got their 4-7am nonstop barking. Then, day of leaving to go out of town, I turned on my bluetooth speaker, set it up as close as possible to the wall we state with her apartment, turned it up, and hit play on the phone. That played on a loop until one of the devices finally ran out of battery. Since that little trick, she's done something to keep them quiet in the daytime. The 4am barks still happen, but it's a compromise I'll take.",

The moment they start making a racket, I turn away and go inside.\n\nRosie the goldendoodle now will be barking up a storm, but sees me and immediately shuts up and gives the big wags.  It took no time to teach her a command to put paws up on the fence so she could get plenty of head and neck scritches.  When we're done, I tell her, \"Ok, I have to go see my puppy now!\" at which time she hops down and quietly walks away.\n\nThey will still bark up a storm when I come out with my puppers for a walk.  Riley (12.5yr old cocker spaniel) just looks at them like, \"really.   REALLY??\" without making a sound then runs off to pee.\n\n[Puppy tax paid](https://imgur.com/QliU4bL)",

They would let the dog out at about 10 at night for that last \"taking care of business\" run, and then let it bark for 20+ minutes before letting it back inside. This was unamusing to this mother of a 6 and 4 year old. \n\nOne night, I waited by the back window around 9:50 pm. Sure enough, dog was let out a few minutes later and the barking started. I could see them in their house yakking on the phone. I started shouting in time with the dog's barks. \"Let the dog in! Let the dog in! Let the dog in!\" I just kept shouting until they let him in. It was slightly less than 20 minutes, so not very effective.\n\nThe next day, new neighbor was outside chatting with old neighbor. Old neighbor mentions the barking, and that's it's quite loud especially considering it's warming up and windows will be left open at night. New neighbor says, \"Yeah, I hope you don't mind.\" WTF? Old neighbor replies, \"As long as you don't mind your dog's ass full of buckshot.\"  Old neighbor apologized  and clarified he would never shoot a dog, but did emphasize that it was an asshole move to leave the dog out there barking for 20+ minutes every night.\n\nThat night they stayed outside with the dog and immediately let it back in. They did that for about a week, then they started to go back to their old ways. Once again, I plotted. If I were home and aware of the time, I would going outside as soon as I saw them go outside and would just stare over their fence as they brought the dog out. I made sure to stand where they could see me. It worked.",

    "postText": "My older brother(OB) was quite good at convincing people especially when it came to school work in order to get out of doing homework and school activities. (my family talks about this all the time and laugh now so it's okay to share)\nSo at this time my family moved and my older brother and I were placed in another school. I was in 5th grade and my brother was in middle school. Now this school was actually really nice and was the 2nd best public school in the state so both my brother and I had to work extra hard in it and my brother was always trying to get out of doing work. I don't blame him now. It was super hard. \nOne day he comes home and he has to do a book report. He goes to tell my ma and she asks what book so he tells her (I'm not gonna say the book but it was based on a very serious historical event). He told her that he was going to watch the movie instead of reading the book. My ma was annoyed and told him that he can't because movies get Hollywoodised and some important information can be taken out. He said, \"oh it's not that type of book report.\" My mother confused asked what does he mean by that. He said with a straight face, \"I have to do interpretive dance.\" My ma was puzzled and even more confused but actually bought it for min sense it was a nice school and they might do things differently. Also he looked completely serious. She told my dad and he laughed saying, \"you actually bought that?\" My mother even more mad because she bought it confronted my brother. He laughed and told her, \"okay I'm gonna go watch the movie.\" My ma smirked \"no you're not cause you don't then I'm gonna go and do interpretive dance on how my son is lazy and doesn't want to put in the work.\" My brother shocked, \"you wouldn't dare.\" But all my mother did was stare and grin. So my brother buckled down and did his book report but my ma was still annoyed for being tricked into thinking that he had to do interpretive dance to a book\n\nA couple years passed and we move down south to a new school and during a meeting with his teachers she tells all them all about how my brother can be manipulative and that story alongwith some other stories he did just to get out of doing work. His math teacher (which she ends up being mine. She was so cool.) turns to her and grins, \"oh so he likes doing that? I'm sure you'll find by the end of the day today you'll be the one laughing.\" My ma a bit confused but laughs along with her finishes the meeting and goes home. Meanwhile class starts and my brother not paying attention is sitting there when this math teacher walks him. She starts with \"Okay class today we're gonna learn about angles! OB what angle is this?\" And she does a pose. My brother confused shrugs. \"Oh you don't know? Well how about this angle? Could you tell me what this angle is?\" So the teacher does another pose. My brother super confused at this point and just shrugs again. \"Well that's that's shame because I just spoke with your mother and she told me how much you LOVE interpretive dance! So I decided to use it class to help you pay attention more then maybe you'll be able to make more of an effort!\" The class starts laughing and my brother shocked of any words slumps in his seat and puts his hoodie on.\nLater he goes home and while my ma and I are talking he tells her, \"I hate you! You embarrassed me!\" He runs into my room as suddenly my ma confused at first starts to smirk so she yells to him, \"Next time don't mess with me! Also do your homework sense you're already in that room!!\" \nEventually he tells everyone what had happened and now it's a super funny story my family shares. Hope you enjoyed it! My older brother is definitely the trouble maker but I still love him lol",

            "comment": "My younger brother was always trying to be funny for his buddies when in HS so he told their language arts teacher his nickname was Scooter when she asked about nicknames so she'd be able to call students by the name they were most comfortable with (think Allie for Alexandra or Tommy instead of Thomas, etc.) Except Scooter was not his nickname. So she spent the rest of the year calling him Scooter and his buddies had to remind him to answer her.\n\nI was in the community theatre company that year and one of the more colorful teachers in school was also a member. When I say colorful, he had long, thinning hair, a handlebar mustache and wore colorful ties and bright plaid sports coats all the time, even in the 100 degree Houston, TX heat. I thought the story was hilarious, mostly because the language arts teacher was a weirdo (I took her class as a freshman) and knowing my brother's sense of humor, I knew how he'd play the situation for big laughs. I told the story to the theatre members one evening during after rehearsal alcohol consumption and the teacher in the group was amused. I didn't think much of it until a week or so later when my brother came home and couldn't figure out why that particular teacher began waving at him and calling out \"Hey, Scooter!\" every time he saw him. Which made that shit even funnier every time Little Bro mentioned it.",

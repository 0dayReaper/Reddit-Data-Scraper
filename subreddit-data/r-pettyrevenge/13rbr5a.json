    "postText": "From [this /r/fuckcars post](https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/13qyrb6/i_messed_with_an_entitled_driver_today_and_it/), not my post.\n\n&gt;I probably went too far but it felt right at the time. You know those drivers who stop at the pedestrian crossing when the light is red, instead of behind?\n\n&gt;I've always hated it and never had the courage to do/say something. Dunno what came over me today, but this van did it, and I mean straight up covered the pedestrian crossing. A lady with a stroller went around the front where cars are blowing exhaust pipes into her baby's face as they're whooshing past.\n\n&gt;So I went around the back, opened his back doors wide, and just walked away. My headphones were on but I paused the music and could just hear the guy yelling asshole as he had to get out and close the van door, while the cars behind him were honking cuz the light was now green.\n\n&gt;Somehow I feel a little bad but also very proud?\n\n&gt;p.s. the flair is sarcastic. I know it's not really activism.",

    "postText": " \n\nI  work as an electrician in a major metropolitan area. Many years ago I  was part of a big crew working on a years long project for a  multinational\u2019s pet food brand. Factory, Research, offices, etc.\n\nOne  building was for research and development. Because this was essentially  a lab, it had tons of dedicated circuits, which are where one outlet is  fed by one breaker in the panel. Because of this we were pulling tons  of wire thru conduits. Full days spent spent pulling bundles from point A  to point B.\n\nOf course all the  other trades were working on their own things as well, and we all got  along fine, except for the floor guys. They would plug a radio in and  crank it up while they worked. Most days nobody minded, but when we are  doing wire pulls you need to be able to hear the guy at the other end of  the pipe. Basically they have to pull when you feed, and you need to be  able to shout \u201cstop!\u201d or \u201cok!\u201d etc.\n\nSo  we asked nicely if the floor guys could turn the music off, or at least  down, while we were doing this. They refused. I remember one guy saying  \u201cwe gotta have our jams man! We can\u2019t work without them.\u201d\n\nAn  old timer I worked with, I\u2019ll call Ollie, was cool but took no crap.  And he hatched a plan. The floor guys plugged their radio into the same  plug every day. Ollie had me find which circuit controlled that plug.  And told me to get there a little early the next morning. So I did.\n\nThe  next morning Ollie had the 277 volt panel opened up as well as the 120  volt panel that fed the plug the floor guys used. And we jumpered a wire  from the 277 volt panel to the plug they used for their radio.  Basically feeding more than twice as much electricity to that outlet. My  job was to watch them and let Ollie know when they had tried to turn  their radio on (and to make sure no one else tried to use that plug.)\n\nA  few minutes go by and the floor guys show up. Plug their radio in and  turn it on. No sound comes out but some smoke sure does. I high tail it  back to the electrical room and Ollie and I quickly put everything back  to normal. A couple minutes later one of the floor guys finds us and  tells us that plug isn\u2019t working. Ollie grabs a corded drill and heads  over to it. Plugs it and fires up the drill and says \u201cseems like it\u2019s  working fine. Maybe your radio is busted?\u201d And as he heads back I hear  him say \u201clet\u2019s see if you can\u2019t work without your fucking jams\u2026\u201d\n\nWe finished our wire pulls in blessed silence and that radio never worked again.",

Until then, I\u2019ve been known to park my car right up their tail pipe if the park in front of their driveway when I\u2019m not home. It seems to be working because the grass is growing back in that corner, and the sprinkler is working. I tried putting a few pieces of knee high metal black fencing at the corner, but the husband didn\u2019t like it and took it down. I\u2019d rather not eat with my hubby, and he can\u2019t complain where I park my car.",

For now, I\u2019ve been known to park super close to his bumper if he\u2019s parked directly in front of their driveway. He has taken to parking only partially in front of the driveway.

Of course being young and their first time away from their parents, they didn't think warn the other residents, so they could prepare. (I.e. Get babies away for the night or buy ear plugs...)\n\nDownstairs lived an old lady, who didn't complain about the unwarned noise till after 3am. She also didn't call the police. All seemed fine...\n\nBut then at 7am on the dot the students are woken by a terrible noise triggering their hangover headaches. The old lady had started her revenge - playing 'Der Rosenkavalier' (an opera) at full volume. And she didn't stop until it was finished.\n\nThe students learned their lesson. The next time they wanted a party, the residents were warned in advance and the music was quieter and the party not quite as long. The lady had earned their respect and fear by doing to them, what they did to her.\n\nI don't know, if the story ever happened, but it was used by students to teach younger students about the importance of warning the other apartments. (typically a letter a few days in advance stating the date, time, estimated end, sometimes an invite and/or a reason or an offer for ear plugs)",

I never was quite sure how many people live there, but I could tell who was home by what music they had blasting.\n\nIf the parents were home, it was non-stop Mariachi music. If the parents weren't home and the kids were, it was Latino hip hop.\n\nI tried talking to them, bringing them baked goods as a peace offering, but the language barrier was too hard to overcome. I turned my speakers against the wall and blasted classic rock. It was so loud that I could max out my TV and still not hear it.\n\nOther circumstances intervened, and I put the condo on the market. It sold in a day, which was terrific, with the 45-day escrow.\n\nMidway through the escrow., The music started up again. Thinking swiftly, I called my realtor and asked her if it was a good idea for me to call the cops just to get some peace and quiet.\n\nShe told me that she could never advise me in that regard, but it sure wouldn't look good if the new owners knew there was police coming for a noise complaint.\n\nI test it out, moved out, I never looked back.\n\nI still cannot abide the sound of mariachi music.",

He searched the entire greenhouse and other people's cars convinced someone stole it. Ordered a new radio, which he promptly destroyed by letting it sit in the rain. A couple days later he went to move his \"workbench\" and found the original radio. Never did learn his lesson but hot damn we had a good laugh at his expense.",

We had space in the basement of this old house on campus for our station, with a bunch of ham radios, test equipment and stuff.\n\nOn the floor right above us was some other student group.  They of course had an FM radio cranked REALLY LOUD.   I mean, we're college students and pretty chill, but when it's loud one floor away.. plus, we're trying to use our stuff.\n\nSo we had a signal generator that covered the FM broadcast bands.  Hook a short piece of wire to it as an antenna, and tune up to the same frequency as the FM radio station they listen to.. and silence!   (FM receivers have this \"capture effect\".. go look it up if you care.)   With a little bit of care, you could slow drag the receiver's AFC (automatic frequency control) by shifting the frequency of the signal generator to an adjacent station's frequency and then turning it off.  And now the were listening to the annoying station different than the one before.\n\nIt was great fun and sport to screw with them from time to time.",

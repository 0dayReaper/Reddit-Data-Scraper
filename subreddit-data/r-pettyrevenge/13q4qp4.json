    "postText": "First off before I start, just know that me doing this has probably permanently blacklisted me from working for this company EVER. But this economy is a big world, it was in an industry I had no experience in, so I'm not exactly worried. \n\n**What happened**\n\nI applied to a job, this job is a B2B job in some industry I have never worked in before (but I do have lots of B2B experience)\n\nThen one day...I get a rejection email...that said \"Since you missed your scheduled interview we are removing you from consideration\"\n\nNow let me stress, if this rejection email would have simply said \"We have decided not to move forward with you\" like 99% of them do, OR if the reason for their rejection was valid such as one I got was \"We value your sales experience, unfortunately we found someone else with sales experience plus industry experience\"\n\nThat would be fair, and the story would end there.\n\n**PROBLEM**\n\nThere was no interview, I even checked. I searched my phone, I searched my email, I had two emails from this company\n\n* Thank me for applying\n* Rejecting me for not showing up to the interview\n\n**I'm annoyed**\n\nI consider myself a very organized, punctual individual. I also get really annoyed when I get in \"trouble\" for something that I didn't do. In this case, I felt it was wrong that I was being rejected for an interview...that was NEVER SCHEDULED.\n\nGood news though I had already been at my new job so that's nice. So I can afford to be petty!\n\n**The Setup**\n\nThe email was from a no-reply email, but it had a name. I found that person on LinkedIn and reached out to them...no response.\n\nSo then I figured out who that person's boss was. Same deal, no response...strange I'd expect HR folks to check LinkedIn...O well. \n\nAfter some thought I went back to the job, I was being hired for X region in Y product group. B2B...the sales director has to be on LinkedIn right? You'd be correct! He was!\n\nSo I sent him a message and I said \"Mr. Director I am excited to work for you, I think X region is poised for massive growth based upon Z factor and I feel you guys have a unique competitive advantage in the Y product group and I'd love to accelerate the amazing growth you're going be a part of\"\n\n**Got Em!**\n\nThe sales director sent me a PM, asking for my number. We had a brief chat, he was pumped. I pointed out I figured out he was the decision maker for the role, I did the research on his product and his region and why it's set for massive growth and that is exactly what you want in a hunter when it comes to B2B. He agreed!\n\nSweet\n\nHe then said he was going get me an interview with HR and himself. We schedule it!\n\n**I get lucky**\n\nOn the invite I see the SAME LADY that was rejected for not showing up to the \"fake\" interview was going be on the call.\n\nWe get on the call, it's going well... let's call the lady Sarah. I go \"Sarah, quick question have you ever scheduled an interview with me?\"\n\nSarah goes \"No\" I go \"So Sarah you didn't schedule an interview with me before right?\" she goes \"Yes I'm positive\" so I go \"So Sarah I didn't miss an interview with you before have I?\" she laughs \"No, no you didn't\"\n\nThe sales director is confused.\n\nI go \"Sarah, you sent me an email saying I was rejected from this position for not showing up to my interview, despite the fact we never scheduled one\"\n\nSarah confused goes \"O...that must have been a misclick\" I go \"I understand, mistakes happen\" she goes \"I'm glad you understand\"\n\nI go \"I do, well hey look I appreciate your time but I just wanted to have a chat with Sarah, I'm not interested in this position\"\n\nShocked the sales director goes \"Excuse me?\" I go \"Yea I just wanted to have a chat with HR on why they rejected me over not showing up to an interview that was never scheduled\" I could tell they where both very angry at me, so I thanked them for their time, and left the meeting.\n\n**End Result**\n\nRadio silence from them, I'm super confident the sales director HAD MANY choice words for me. I'm sure Sarah thinks I'm a dick. I'm also confident I am on their blacklist! Both for this role, any other role in the future!\n\nBut sometimes you just need to get your jab in.\n\nHave a good day everyone!",

Since I was busy at the time I never called in until I received a voicemail from someone at the office stating that since I missed my appointment I needed to call her back and reschedule. So I called her and said Hey I just wanted to mention that no one ever called me for my appointment. She insisted that they had. I said no, You did not. Then she starts telling me the phone number that they called. I said I haven't had that phone for over 3 years and I very specifically know that I updated my information. She wanted to argue about that. So then I said Well it's interesting that you think that my old number that I've already changed is the one that you should have been calling because that's not the number you called to leave the voicemail. You called my current number like you should have for my appointment.",

Instead it was an ambush as I walked into a room with the country manager, regional manager and regional VP. They instead offered me a co-ordinator role doing basically the same job I was already doing\n\nHang on guys I am here to interview for role A and you are offering role B. Yes we are along with a car and a salary bump. Trouble is I knew it was a poisoned chalice job as my current company was about to win a big contract taking all their work in my department. That was one of the reasons I was looking to change roles asit would be a huge workload increase without any extra reward.\n\nI stood there, looked at them, smiled and said no thanks. They all sat there stunned - you don't want this job? No, I am here for Job A. Why do the same thing with you that I am doing now.\n\nI was basically thrown out the door. Funny thing was two months later 3 of the 4 in the room were let go due to losing the contract to us. I would have been the 4th if I had joined them.",

If my sales manager asked me \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d And I said waiting on so and so to call back\u201d I would be at the very least embarrassed from the lecture I would receive or just fired right there. \u201c you don\u2019t wait for them to call you back. Right now ___ over at ___is calling them getting the sale while you are waiting\u201d add whatever swear words to that you like best. You should have done is the revenge work without revenge in mind in the first place. Researched and got the decision maker on the phone so they can make a decision. That\u2019s how you get sales. There is no industry in sales. Sales are the same no matter what the name on the building says. You are always selling the same thing\u2026dreams! That what every sales person is pitching the dream that your product will make come true if they buy it. Good luck",

So she scheduled interviews on her workstation, blocks off the time in her schedule, but never informs the candidate.  She then lists the candidate as a no-show when they of course don\u2019t show up, which generates an automatic email from the company.  \n\nShe may have been investigated over this if the sales manager became suspicious.",

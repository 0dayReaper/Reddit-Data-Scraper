    "postText": "**TL;DR** The landlord was charging rent twice and was forced to return what they owed.\r  \n\r  \nThis happened in 2011, so most of it is from my memory. I was renting a condo unit in a very nice neighborhood. The landlord, whom I will call John, was very nice. I didn't know his day job, just that he was in the finance domain. This unit was his investment home.\r  \n\r  \nI leased the condo for a year - from May 2010 to April 2011. John would come to collect rent on the first of every month. He preferred cash, and I had no issues paying him in cash. He never bothered me at any other time. Once I had a plumbing issue, I called him, and he promptly sent a plumber to fix it. Basically, our relationship was amicable.\r  \n\r  \nIn January 2011, my company wanted me to move to another location (in a neighboring state). I am into IT and needed to guide a project team that was to start in March. I negotiated with my manager to move around the end of April after my current lease expired. I informed John that I will not renew the lease, and he was cool with it.\r  \n\r  \nIn February, a mutual friend (I will call him Peter) came by my house and immediately fell in love with the neighborhood. He asked me if I knew of any condos that were available for rent. I told him I was planning to vacate by the end of April, and if he was interested, I could talk to my landlord for him. I also gave him John's number. That evening, I called up John and told him my friend is interested in renting the unit and can rent it from May 2011. I also gave him Peter's number to communicate directly. John thanked me, and that was that.\r  \n\r  \nAround the first week of March, my wife's cousin's marriage got finalized. The wedding date was the 7th of April. We are from India, and marriages are a big thing where all the family and relatives get together for several days. There was no way in hell, that my wife would miss it. We decided that she would travel to India with my 4-years old son. I would go to the new office location, and by the time they come back from India (sometime in May), I would have everything set in the new place.\r  \n\r  \nWe booked the flight tickets for my wife and son. Their flight was a few (four or five) days before the wedding. When my manager came to know that I will be alone after April 2nd, he pushed me to join the new office on April 3rd. Those days, working remotely was not considered efficient.\n\nBut I wanted a few days to pack as I was moving to another state. I booked a mover to come on April 11. With all things taken care of from my side, I informed John (around the middle of March) that I was planning to release the condo on April 11. John thanked me, and that was that.\r  \n\r  \nI called Peter and told him I would be leaving earlier in April. By then, John had discussed the rent with him, and they both had signed the lease agreement. Peter was to move in on the 1st of May, 2011.\r  \n\r  \nSince I will be gone starting April 11, Peter asked me if he could move in from April 15 instead. I did not have any objections; I asked him to inform John. Peter checked with John, and John agreed over the phone. Peter called back and updated me.\r  \n\r  \nI never thought of asking Peter for half the rent. I knew he would be paying rent for the whole month for his old apartment, and my apartment would be vacant anyway.\r  \n\r  \nOn April 1, John called and collected the rent in the evening. He asked me how things were going and if I needed any help. I thanked him and declined his help. I asked if he could come by in the evening (after 6 p.m.) of the 11th, for an inspection and to collect the keys.\n\nI was impressed with John for offering help and thought him to be a decent guy. Little did I know that he had ulterior motives. He was making sure that I was leaving by the 11th.\r  \n\r  \nAfter collecting the rent, he went home and called up Peter. He wanted to adjust the lease dates to start the lease on April 15. John was sly enough to wait till he got the rent from me and then wanted to collect the rent again from Peter.\r  \n\r  \nPeter signed it but did not tell me until a few days later. When I heard this, I was livid. I asked Peter, \"When did you sign the new lease?\". As I suspected, John had called Peter the night of April 1, after collecting the rent from me. They signed the new lease the next day - April 2.\n\nI called John and asked him to pay me back the rent for half of the month, as he was already charging it from Peter. He said, \"No can do, you have signed the lease until the end of the month.\" (I am paraphrasing here; I don't remember his exact words now.)\r  \n\r  \nI was mad, but he had a point. And with so many things to take care of during the move (on top of the hectic work schedule at that time), I couldn't even think I had the time to take any action against him. Normally, I am not a vengeful guy, but I wanted John to ***pay*** (and not necessarily monetarily). I stewed over it for a day or two, and suddenly an idea came to my mind, and I thought of giving it a shot.\r  \n\r  \nI waited till the 10th, and on the evening of April 10, I called John and told him that he need not come for the inspection the next evening as I changed my plans. I will be moving out on the 28th of April instead. John became quiet for a few seconds. Then he said, \"But you were planning to move out tomorrow.\" He was stammering. I said, \"Yes, but I have the lease until the end of the month, so I am planning to take it slow.\" It was a taste of the same bitter medicine that he gave me. Then I nicely said \"good night\" and disconnected the call.\r  \n\r  \nI don't know what was going on in John's mind, but he must have been pretty scared about the lease he had signed with Peter. As per the lease, Peter had a right to move in from April 15, but I had already paid for the whole month and I am within my rights to stay till the end of the month. If I didn't vacate, Peter could take him to court.\r  \n\r  \nThe next morning (the day of the move), John called me on the dot at 7 a.m. He asked me if I would consider moving sooner *if he paid me part of the rent*. I said yes. The poor guy materialized in a minute. It turns out he was waiting outside in his car to meet me if I agreed.\r  \n\r  \nJohn handed me an envelope. I counted the money and was a little confused. There was $800 in it. My monthly rent at that time was $1,250, and I would have settled for $625 or less.\r  \n\r  \nThis was early in the morning, and I was thinking of the movers and 100 other things that needed to be taken care of that day. I was not prepared to interact with John, and we did not even talk about money the previous night. I did not expect him to come over with the money, and that too, so suddenly.\r  \n\r  \nI started feeling sorry for the poor guy and was thinking of returning him the extra $175, but he spoke too soon. He wanted to know (in a demanding voice) if I was going to vacate the condo that evening, as I had previously communicated. I realized he did not deserve my compassion. I wanted to spite him and tell him, \"No, can do\" but I did not escalate it and said, \"Yes, come in the evening for inspection.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe whole day was hectic, but the movers cleared up the house promptly. I had a few other things to take care of and a few things to donate. The evening comes, and John was there exactly at 6 p.m. He did not inspect anything, collected the keys, handed me a check/cheque (returning the full amount of the security deposit I gave at the beginning of the lease signing), and went away. No thank you or goodbye. It felt a bit weird, but there were 800 reasons to ignore that feeling.\r  \n\r  \nI was a bit puzzled about why he gave me $800 instead of $625. I calculated later and assumed that he paid me back for 19 days that I would not be on the property, which comes to $792.\r  \n\r  \nPS: John and Peter are not their real names. April 11th is the correct date (I can never forget it), and all other dates are approximate.",

Revenge is something beyond that or outside the normal rules.\n\nOP just held the landlord to account. That's not revenge.\n\nIf a pickpocket steals my wallet, and I run after him and take it back, without doing anything else to punish him, that's not revenge.",

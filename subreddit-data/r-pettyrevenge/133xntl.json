    "postText": "This isn\u2019t that long of a story. Essentially, there\u2019s a regular at the cafe I work at, who is always just generally unpleasant. She complains every time we raise the prices as if we, the baristas, are the ones raising the prices. She usually has us make one of our lattes in a size that we don\u2019t normally offer for lattes, and then tells us how to ring it up on our end. Has us remake drinks saying they\u2019re wrong when at least one other person behind the counter can confirm we made the drink correctly the first time. It\u2019s never anything serious she\u2019s just\u2026if you\u2019ve worked in customer service you know what I mean when I say she\u2019s one of thoooose customers. Difficult. And for a long time we were always very nice and accommodating, humoring her and trying not to be jerks back. Until recently.\n\nWe\u2019re a small craft coffee chain so we always do cute latte art on the drinks and hand them out with the lids off so folks can see the art. But recently we\u2019ve pretty much adopted the attitude of \u201cokay you don\u2019t want to tip? fine no latte art for you.\u201d So any time this customer comes in, we make sure not to give her any latte art, and definitely make a point of doing our best job on anyone else\u2019s drink that ordered before her, so as she walks up to the counter she sees a very pretty latte art and then just her cup.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty petty I know, but you can\u2019t be a regular, expect constant accommodations, be difficult and then never tip.",

I did almost 9 years in the Starbucks penitentiary\u2026and the best thing I got out of it was I went in being shy and left knowing how human behavior works. I found the way these kinds of people act fascinating. I would always act extra special nice to see if I could win them over. Some I succeeded with. Best start was \u201ceh don\u2019t worry about it it\u2019s free today\u201d (fuck Starbucks and their corporate nonsense) and then they would open up cause I did something for them even when they were being shitty. Here\u2019s the best one I got: (I did not win her over) she came in once a week in the morning early. Ordered the same 2 drinks every time. Was absolutely a terror. Always jumpy and angry. Always answering texts. But damn was she consistent. The drink that was hers was a grande sugar free vanilla latte with 6 pumps + whatever degrees temp that doesn\u2019t make sense that I can\u2019t remember. Light foam. Every time\u2026over 8 years and every time she would do the same thing. Walk outside\u2026take a sip\u2026storm back in. And have a toddler fit about how it\u2019s all wrong and she needs it to be remade this second. After half a year of this\u2026we figured her out. She would do her routine. Come back. Throw a fit. We would make steamy latte sounding noises. Put a new lid on the same drink she brought back (red lipstick) and she would taste it and be like \u201cahh perfect\u201d get all pleasant and leave. And I realized\u2026.she doesn\u2019t care about the drink at all. I think she was picking up drinks for her shitty boss. But she\u2019s using Starbucks to have one moment in her life she has full power over.",

I\u2019m a great tipper, usually like 30% because i know folks are hurting right now and wtf i happen to be lucky and can afford to help.\n\n\nBut i ordered a pizza, i\u2019m cool with long wait times but after an hour and a half my pizza tracker hadn\u2019t moved so i called the store to check in. They put me on hold for a half hour and then i heard someone pick up the phone and hang up. So i called back and got on hold again, leave the phone on, hopped in the car and drove to the store.\n\nWhen i got there i asked them why they put me on hold, hung up on me, and i showed them i was still on hold for a half hour AGAIN. They told me they were super busy and then told me that if i could come into the store to get my pizza why\u2019d i order delivery?? I was kinda surprised but i just said \u201cwell i wanted it delivered and now i\u2019m here to see if i can just pick it up.\u201d Truthfully if i\u2019d known they were so backed up i\u2019d have ordered something else, which is why i was calling them. They then pegged me as a \u201cdifficult customer.\u201d\n\n\nSo to be petty i just told them here, i\u2019ll pay for it but i\u2019d like my delivery fee back. Apparently this was a whole thing for the cashier and they ended up giving it all to me for free instead, but were total assholes about it. I\u2019m sure i got some extra ball sweat on my pizza, but i mean shit i was hungry enough to not care. Probably has some extra sodium in there anyway.",

Tracker said 30-45min.  30min later and the tracker hadn't even moved to \"preparing.\"  So i called.  But instead of the employees being douchebags, they answered, told me they were behind and they would get my pizza in asap.  Tracker never did move, but like 15min later my pizza was delivered.  And in my email i have a nice letter saying \"here, take 50% off of your next order for the inconvenience.\"  That's the way your own transaction should have gone.\n\nUnfortunately, i did need a juice box before my pizza got to me, but at least it did get to me.",

You sound like an awesome person, someone I would be proud to work for. \n\nYesterday was my one year \"fired\" anniversary. I have held my head high, and I'm so glad to be free of the toxicity that consumed me 24/7. That place turned me angry and hateful, which is now gone. \n\nI love your last sentence...you're right, I didn't need them. They actually needed me. Firing the person who did the most work and was the fastest left them with two workers and a manager to do it all. Within months, the other two workers quit, and the manager got demoted for lots of absences. All I got to say about that (I'll be nice.) is......HAHA!\n\nSorry for telling you about my crap, just felt good to \"talk\" to someone who cares about others.",

Then he'd come to the counter and say he didn't like it and wanted his money back.  AND THEY GAVE IT TO HIM!!!  Every single time!!  I told her to tell him no and she said they'd lose a customer if they did.  I told her they didn't have a customer if there was no money being made.  They just had a freeloader that wanted breakfast.  In fact, they'd actually make money if they told him to take a hike.  \n\nIt's not \"good customer service\" when they walk all over you.  You're better off getting rid of them in the long run.  I helped run a business seminar a long time ago and the keynote speaker said all customers aren't good customers.  If you have a bad one, you do two things.  First, tell them they aren't your customer anymore.  Then you send them to your competition.",

Yes, she's obviously an PITA, but serving people like her are part of the job.  If making her latte in a size that's not normally made is in issue, take it up with your manager or the owner of the chain and ask if you can stop accommodating her request for \"special\" sizes of lattes, or how much extra you should be charging for it.  I seriously doubt the lack of latte art has any affect on her.

But there's a reason for this tip BS, and it all boils down to the gov't. \n\n**Yes I know fully grown adults also work these low wage jobs. There's a myriad of reasons why people end up here. Not everyone gets a college education. People die, leaving their spouse in dire financial straights, divorce, addiction, many reasons. At least they're working and are just as valuable as the millionaire CEO's of these businesses \u2764\ufe0f",

    "postText": "Back in the mid-nineties,, my school friends and I started sixth-form college. My friend Jim had been a dick about my liking metal for the last couple of years, claimed band members were all pricks, and just generally wouldn't give it the time of day. He made a couple of new friends in his computing class and immediately decided that he liked metal and it was cool after all. This irritated me. \n\nHe asked me to run him off a tape of Rage Against the Machine by Rage Against the Machine. So I obliged, but at around track 4, I added in an extra song which I wrote in the track listing as Surrender, as I thought that seemed Ragey enough.\n\nIt was Waterloo by ABBA.",

I wish it was Helmet\" which I thought was pretty strange. Turns out another of our friends had given him a copy of a Helmet album in high school, with the wrong label. He'd not heard either band so for a very long time thought Helmet was Pavement. I can only imagine how weird he must have thought there musical direction had shifted on subsequent albums he listened to.",

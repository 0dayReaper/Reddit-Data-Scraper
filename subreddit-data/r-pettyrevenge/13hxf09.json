    "postText": "So in March our whole family took a trip to CA after the death of my grandma. My parents, my grandfather, me, my husband, and our daughter who is two. When we were getting on the plane this guy tried to cut in front of us in line to get on the plane and when the flight attendant was going to help with our stroller he wouldn\u2019t move out of her way. Okay rude. So we get on the plane and as he passes us he looks at my daughter and says \u201cOh great,\u201d and sat behind us. He sat behind my daughter and kicked her seat the whole time. And as a mom I was going to prove that he was the dirt wad. My daughter did great. We ate snacks, watched movies, colored, stickers, even took a nap. All the flight attendants came to see her and said she was super good! So we go to get off the plane and this same man ended up standing up before us and is standing next to me in the isle. He proceeds to fart over and over again in my face. He would fart and then look down at me. So I was done. I had brought my own small trash bags so we could clean up after ourselves and of course we\u2019d accumulated some trash. So I discreetly dropped it (opened) in his brookstone shopping bag. Enjoy the sticky mentos, fries, gum, and some Barbie sticker trash. My grandfather saw me do it and gave me a high five. I get that kids on planes are stressful for everyone, but don\u2019t be a jerk.",

    "postText": "My boyfriend and I play Zelda: Breath of the Wild together. I am a \"take your time and enjoy the ride\" kind of gal, while he is a \"let's look up how to beat this game right now\" kind of guy. Because his way ruins all the fun, we came up with a rule:\n\nNo looking up spoilers!\n\nWe were looking for a particular challenge (The Eight Heroine side quest for my fellow Zelda nerds) for a very long time. Suddenly, my boyfriend said:\n\n\"I did something bad... I looked up where to go. I'm so sorry. I just couldn't take it anymore.\"\n\nI told him it was fine but that he could not tell me what he had seen. He agreed.\n\nI then excused myself to the bathroom and looked up the location as well. I then spent the next HOUR AND A HALF wandering SOOOO close to the location without ever making it there. I could see him squirming around in his seat every time I got close.\n\nWhen I jumped off the cliff the statue was built into, gliding down to the base of the statue and continuing on without turning around to look at it, I thought he was going to explode. He was clenching his hair in both fists and biting his lower lip trying to contain himself.\n\nThat's when I caved and told him what I had done. He thought it was hilarious and told me about how he wanted more than anything to yell \"TURN AROUND!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!\" We had a good laugh about it. He hasn't looked up a spoiler since!",

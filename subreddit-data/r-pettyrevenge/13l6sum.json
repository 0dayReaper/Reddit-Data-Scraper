Had long term scam written all over it. \n\nThe man asked about my phone and phone plan and what not and I participated. He proceeded to offer me a worse plan. \n\nI compared his plan to mine in response. Like, very calmy just pointed out the difference. \n\nHe then asked if I could transfer me to his sales manager. Which I said he could. \n\nShe explained to me the plan again. \n\nI again pointed out the differences in the plans. \n\nShe said \"So you're not interested in this?\" \n\nI replied I was not. \n\nShe then asked what I wanted. \n\nI said \"Nothing. You called me.\" \n\nAnd she hung up. \n\nI know they're already working a terrible job that doesn't pay them enough. I promise I didn't do anything worse than waste their time, like they did mine. \n\nThis is only petty revenge after all.",

I'm not sure on miles, it's either 156,000 or 256,000 as there isn't a 6th digit for miles and this car is way too rough to only have 56,000 miles.\"\n\"What's that?

It represented industrial success for a country then still part of the Soviet bloc and thus motivated to demonstrate such prowess, and the Yugo sourced parts from all the different constituent nations within Yugoslavia, which of course fractured into ugly civil war in the 1990s. \nAs a result of those civil wars, Montenegro emerged initially as part of a federation with Serbia, only gaining independence in 2006. Shortly thereafter, the 2008 recession was especially damaging to the fledgling country, where foreign investment continues to represent a too-high proportion of overall economic activity. Moreover, road development in Montenegro is among the worst of any European country (only about a third of the mileage is paved), hindering the development of automotive culture. The whole country is only about 5300 square miles (smaller than the US state of Connecticut), much of it covered by quite rugged mountains. So lots of Montenegrins continue to toddle along in their little 1980s runabouts.",

One weekday a load of Yugo's came into the yards at sundown and parked on a siding to be unloaded the next morning and loaded on car carriers for distribution. There were somewhere around 360 Yugo's in the Rail shipment. When he got to work the next morning unloading of the Yugo's had already begun but none had been loaded on car carriers. From his 3rd story Yard Office window, he could see something was wrong. He called his man on the siding to see what was wrong. The car carrier drivers and loaders had discovered the 2 door Yugo's front seats were fixed non retractable from the factory and you could not get in the back seat. Therefore, the German Dealerships would not accept the Yugo's in that shape and told the drivers to come on home empty and they did.\n\nFour days later 8 train cars came into the Rail Yard loaded with new 2 door retractable front seats, and Yugo Factory workers to install them. They had already arranged to rent a Rail Yard warehouse to do the work in case of bad weather. They worked 18 hours a day and lived and slept and cooked in the box cars they came in with the replacement seats and tools. They finished the job in 3 days, loaded up the old, fixed seats and their tools and went back to Yugo land. Funny Side Note: No matter the color of the interior of the Yugo's, every replacement retractable front seat was \"Black\". I hope Yugo new car buyers got a discount for that color scheme????",

Shortly after they started calling trying to get me to sign up for home phone service which would nearly double my monthly bill. \n\nI asked the person about the benefits of the plan. \"Oh, the phone is active even when the power's out!\" I told them that's not true. They'd be passing in the signal as VOIP through the modem and unless I had a battery backup the phone would absolutely go out. Unless they were the local phone company running copper lines what they'd said was a lie. Plus, I have my cell phone which continues to work when the power goes out because it has its own battery and the cell towers run off generators when the mains drops. And, if the cell network goes out I'm a licensed radio operator so I'll use that equipment to communicate.\n\nSo, then it was \"great to have home phone service as a connection for my fax machine and alarm system.\" I'm not from the past, so I don't have a fax machine, and my alarm system uses a cell connection so the phone lines can't be cut to prevent the monitoring service from sending the police.\n\nFurther, I have my cell phone on me at all times, and when I get home after a long day at work, why would I want to have a redundant avenue for people to call me that would require getting up to answer?\n\nOnly time I've had a telemarketer hang up on me.

If I'm driving with the windows down, they get speakerphone and windnoise.  If I'm working, I set my phone near the loudest thing I can find and walk away.  One of my favorites was telling a guy \"yeah hang on juuuuust a second\" like 5 times on speaker.  When I finally walked back over to the phone I told him, \"thanks for listening to me take a piss while you waiting on me to tell you to go fuck yourself.\"\n\nAnswer it always, if you're in a good mood, don't talk to them, just answer, press whatever to get a real person, then just set it down.  Having to ask \"hello\" three times is still more time wasted than if you didn't pick up at all.  Any time of theirs you waste is time they aren't scamming.",

Although I did have one guy one day try very hard to argue that he was intact working for this company, and asked why I thought it was a scam.

They call, they get a clip of your voice saying Yes, they get hold of your credit card/checking account information, then they use that to charge everything to you from little things like ice packs to big things like cruises and sports cars. They send you texts: \"We have an offer to sell your house, please click on this or that and fill out the form for more information\" and the form turns out to be one that turns your house over to them, legally. Another text: They send something innocuous but it's to someone else, and when you return the text saying it's a wrong number, that starts a conversation in which they try to get you involved in something, say investments, but it's a total scam. They call old people, impersonate their grandchildren, say they're in jail and need bail, and it's all a lie but if that \"bail\" gets paid they never see the money again. They call impersonating the police or someone from the courts, and say you missed a jury duty date. They offer to clear you for a fee. None of that is true. And that's not even a drop in the bucket, just ones I can remember off the top of my head. There's an old saying that goes, \"If you play with fire, sooner or later you'll get burned,\" and to me, that applies here. Just hang up. Delete the texts. Use real numbers you already own -not the one they give you, or the one they called from- to double check their claim. Report the numbers to online sites that track such things. You can try the National Do Not Call list but when we did, we thought it only made things worse, at our house. I've had more success saving the number and marking it Scam.",

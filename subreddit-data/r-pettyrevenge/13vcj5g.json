    "postText": "If you have heard of Mardi Gras in New Orleans, you have likely heard that it is a racously good time.  \nFor all except food service/ hospitality employees.  For them, it is a month of hellacious work.   \nIf you are unaware, 'Carnival Season' begins at Twelfth Night/King's Day - the sixth of January.  \nThis continues for 40 godforsaken days.  \nAt this time, in the early aughts, I was FOH/bar manager at a Denny's across from our local, **very prominent** airport.    \nFor context, I am a BOH devotee.  I am extensively trained in the area.  However, a long-hauler with limited skill occupies that management spot.  Okay.  Not trying to harsh your buzz.  \nBut, a position for Assistant General Manager became open that I would be well equipped for.  \nI applied.  Interviewed well.  \nAnd an outside applicant was hired.  Upon looking into them, they are not as qualified.  \nOkay.  Missed my shot.  We'll try again later.  \nMardi Gras rolls around.  \nThe NEWEST HIRED **required** the entirety of the busiest, last week of Mardi Gras OFF to watch his 5 year old daughter throw beads in a truck parade!!!  YA'LL!!!!  That is some low-stakes shiznit.  Seriously.  LOW stakes.  \nNEXT!!  The GM decides to follow suit.   He decides that he **HAS** to **ATTEND** parades with his family during the busiest time of this Carnival season!!  \nOur schedule comes out. 2 managers handling a 24 hr restaurant for a week.  Some turn-arounds are as little as 4 hours long.  \nUh.  NO.  Even despite my recent type 1 diabetes diagnosis, I will fight that tooth and nail.  \nI approached GM.  Hard NO.  I approached HR.  Hard NO.  I approached GM again.  And knew what his answer would be......but:  \nI went to this meeting in my pajamas.  I will give you as much respect as you give me.  \nI made my final plea, that I knew would be dismissed.  \nAnd I placed my keys upon his desk.  \nSaid \"Enjoy Mardi Gras\".  \nAnd walked out.",

Usually would promote within because you\u2019re a known quantity\u2026 work habits, quality, etc. Then he asks for the busiest week off and gets it. Sounds fishy to me. I think your health comes first and you needed to get out of that situation. And I applaud the way you did it\u2026 pajamas, hysterical \ud83d\ude2d",

    "postText": "so, i have tourette's. it sucks. i often get bad stuff said to me, especially by this one girl. she has been harassing me for months now but today she followed me home screaming the R-slur at me. i started recording it and emailed it to her mom, dad, our headmaster, our schools SENCO leader and the head of our sixth form. there is a strict policy at my school that means no ableism, homophobia, racism or anything of the sort. and since we only have a month and a half left, her acceptance letter has been revoked, it has been placed on her permanent record and she now cannot apply anywhere else she would want to go since the application date is out for most sixth forms within an hour drive of where we live. jokes on her",

I remember the way we all wore torn denim and falling apart jeans, a beautiful palette of blacks and grays with dark flannel. Or the leather, fishnets, tiny skirts and the spiked hair. \n\nNot anymore. Most people were business casual. There were.. *khakis* and pressed button down shirts. I had the only blue hair in the room *that wasn\u2019t natural old lady blue* and the only hair that was not a normal, naturally occurring color in nature! \n\nFriend. I am pushing *fifty* and was the only one dressed in my go to concert clothes, minus the Doc Martin\u2019s bc my feet are too twisted to wear them. (Side effect of the paralysis). No one moshed. No one even stood up. Songs were given *polite applause* and not the screams and whistles and yells they used to get. \n\nThe only song that got an ovation was the last one. And no one stood and cheered for an encore. The guys said they\u2019d be back in five and *everyone just stood around waiting* instead of being friendly and rowdy. \n\nI know I\u2019m pushing 50. I know the crowd for VF skews older. But damn, that audience was boring. The show? Amazing. I have no idea how the band could be so energetic and wild when the audience was lukewarm at best. Ugh. \n\nI got a lot of shushes and dirty looks for hooting and clapping really loudly. It made me laugh that the people who used to devotedly follow an *acoustic* **punk** *band* and were fan enough to come see them 42 years after the first album was released\u2026shushed me. For enjoying the concert. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

After that, the general options are get a job, go to \"sixth form\" at your school to do another two years of school work or go to \"college\" to do two years of education in a more specialised subject.In my case, I went to college to study electrical and mechanical engineering for two years. When I went to university (This is what you'd call \"college\") at 18 to study aerospace engineering I was the only kid who'd done the college/engineering route - nearly everyone else had studied maths and physics indepth at sixth form.We quickly all realised that both paths had benefits - they all excelled at engineering mathematics (Which is a HUGE part of engineering) whilst I struggled but I could already use a lathe and milling machine and understood basic electronics and materials science..",

GSCE is the year before sixth form and used to be called O-level a long time ago, whence OWL. Currently you do A-levels in sixth form.\n\nThe system's different in Scotland (and has changed multiple times since I left school in 2005), our sixth form is only one year and it's not in a separate college from our high school. But it's optional. We do highers in the fifth form and then Advanced Highers in the sixth form which i think are like AP classes? slightly harder than A-levels? it gets confusing if you try to compare. Also our sixth form is literally the sixth year of high school, in England it goes like year 11, then sixth form which is two years and it doesn't make sense to me.",

You only do 3 A-levels (4 in special cases for the academically gifted) Vs 4 or 5 adv highers. Generally you need 3 A-levels or 4 adv highers to be accepted to university. \n\nNot that the adv higher year is easier overall, just that each subject isn't covered to the same level but you do more subjects. \n\nAs you said though, they seem to change the Scottish system bizarrely frequently.",

Most school set ups are Primary school (up to Year 6 at 11 y.o.) then Secondary school (Years 7 - 11, so 12 y.o. to 16 y.o.) This completes the legally required minimum education, so people can go off and get full time jobs from 16. Those who stay in formal education (as opposed to technical/apprenticeship education) can go to Sixth Form College from 16-18 years old, so Year 12 &amp; 13, where they do A Levels, and specialise in 3 or 4 subjects. Nowadays these are often attached to the Secondary school, but not always. Prior to about 1988-ish the Secondary schools did 'O' Levels (or Ordinary Level qualifications) and the years were called First Year (in Secondary school, and going way back it was First Form) to Fifth Year. So the next school up from that was Sixth Form College  (where you took 'A' or Advanced Level qualifications). Above that is University from 18 years old.",

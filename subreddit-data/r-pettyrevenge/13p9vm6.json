    "postText": "When I was in highschool, I had a back pack with a mesh pocket meant for a Nalgene. \n\nI\u2019d put candy, the cookies the spec Ed class sold, or soda in it.\n\nSomeone in school started walking along side me and easing them out where I didn\u2019t feel it. I assume they threw the soda away as a gag, but were eating the cookies and candy.\n\nOne day I was looking for something in the medicine cabinet at home, and saw something called \u201cChoco-lax\u201d.\ud83d\ude08\n\nIt looked like it was older than me. I opened it and they were the exact size and shape of a Hershey pip. The individually wrapped squares. \n\nThey had the name stamped on the top, so I took a hot butter knife and smeared it like it partially melted, ate the pips, and re-wrapped the chocolax.\n\nLeft them in the mesh pocket over the next week. They eventually disappeared. I figured out who it was when they ran out of the classroom, trying not to shit their pants. I don\u2019t know how successful they were.\n\nYou have to imagine they tasted terrible. I don\u2019t know how many he ate.",

I really didn't want to have them doing this so I bought a box of Chicklets gum and a box of Feen-A-Mint laxative gum. I removed all of the Chicklets except 2 and put the Feen-A-Mint in. The next day they asked for a stick and I said I did not have the same kind.  THey looked at it and said it was OK.  The next day 3 of the 4 were out \"sick\".  They figured out what I had done and about a month later one of them offered me a piece of fudge.  I said, \"oh, thank you , but I'm not hungry.  And you know what they tried to do!",

Theft is wrong obviously, but so is PURPOSELY DISGUISING MEDICINE AS CANDY. How about this as a counter comparison: if op was handing out candy to children would it be okay for him to disguise chocolate laxatives as real candy in order to trick greedy children into eating it?",

How do you not get this?",

If they had melted chocolate with ground glass, cyanide, etc, cast it into molds, and offered it to the thief, you would be right.  However, what you instead have is something that *is* intended for consumption (granted, consumption by those who are constipated, but nevertheless intended for consumption), that is *not* offered to the thief, and the thief takes it and *self-administers* it.  Even if I were to concede that there is 'poisoning' occurring, it would be the thief doing the poisoning, not OP.  OP did not force the thief to eat it.  They did not offer it to the thief.  They did not induce the thief to steal and eat it in any way.\n\nLet me give you a different example.  Imagine I buy some peanut butter cookies, and some of those cookies with butterscotch chips.  They look similar enough.  Now, I eat half of each pack because I'm a pig, and I then add the remaining peanut butter cookies into the butterscotch cookie package.  You break into my house, steal my cookies, and eat them.  However, you've got a deadly peanut allergy, and you go into anaphylactic shock and die.  Did I poison you?\n\nThese situations are *directly analagous*.  In both cases, you have a potentially harmful foodstuff in a package that belies its contents, and a thief that steals and eats it wihout concern for the consequences.  The only difference is that getting a dose of laxatives is a *lot* less harmful than a dose of something you've got a severe allergy to.\n\nIt's not even your attitude that OP 'did wrong' that I object to.  I'm willing to take that as a mere difference of opinion.  What I find especially galling about your comments is the characterization of OP's actions as 'poisoning', as you know the term implies something *much* more serious and blameworthy than what occurred in the post, and your description of the behavior as 'borderline sociopathic'.  Insinuating highly negative things about OP's character and all but calling them a psychopath while the worst words you have for the thief are that you 'don't agree' with their actions (which is roaring approbation by contrast) doesn't sit well with me.  It is yet more victim-blaming.  The perpetrator can do no wrong (only things you 'don't agree' with), but if the victim should fight back?  Oh my god, how dare they?!?",

I'm not justifying theft but its also not okay what op did. It could have potentially caused serious harm to the thief but all anyone on this post sees is \"they got consequences and that's all that matters\" as if going to borderline sociopathic steps to poison someone is okay. Crazy to me but i guess having a conscience and realizing there were potentially peaceful ways to stop it from happening makes me the outlier on this sub",

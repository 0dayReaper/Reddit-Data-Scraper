    "postText": "Several years ago, I was dating a man that seemed almost perfect. We started slow, keeping our kids out of it. He broke up with me once during the time we were dating, before I started bringing my child around him, then a short time later said he\u2019d made a mistake and wanted me back. \n\nFrom that point forward, everything was great. We finally introduced our children to each other, met each other\u2019s families and friends, it was all gravy. The cherry on top was that one night, laying in bed, he said he loved me and my child and would raise my kid as his own. I was in heaven. \n\nA week later, he told me\u2014over the phone\u2014that he wasn\u2019t \u201cfeeling it\u201d anymore and told me to come get my stuff. \n\nI was absolutely hurt, but I was more angry. I was LIVID because it wasn\u2019t just me that he hurt. He broke my child\u2019s heart. How do you explain to a small child that they won\u2019t see someone anymore? (I handled that separately from my revenge.)\n\nIt turned out that although he hadn\u2019t been physically cheating on me, he had been talking to another woman that last week. They were married less than six months after he broke up with me. \n\nOver the few weeks following him dumping me, I started signing him up for things\u2014mail samples of men\u2019s incontinence underwear, prostate health supplements, severe gas treatments, along with many erectile dysfunction treatment options, like natural/herbal supplements, surgeries, and devices. \n\nThe best part came about a month after the break up. I was friendly with one of his friends, we\u2019ll call her Meg, and we went out for drinks. After she had a few, she finally said that she \u201cjust had to know\u201d and asked me if my ex\u2019s \u201cproblems\u201d had caused issues with our home life. \n\nApparently, after the breakup my ex was at Meg and her husband\u2019s house one night. He was so drunk and high that he peed himself while sleeping on their couch. They all went over to my ex\u2019s the next day for a cookout, and Meg found the incontinence underwear under the sink in the bathroom. \n\nI acted uncomfortable with the question and told her that I didn\u2019t really want to talk about it, that he hurt me but I wasn\u2019t going to give details of our private life. She nodded and winked knowingly at me, saying she understood. \n\nI have no idea if he ever convinced his friends that, in his early thirties, he didn\u2019t actually have an incontinence issue. \n\nIt\u2019s petty, but it made me feel better.",

    "postText": "Not the most exciting story to post here, but me and the store manager at the store I worked at did not get along and she'd go as far as to say that I was a whiny brat and that nobody liked to work with me. After being berated similarly a couple more times in the same hour, I quit which made her have to cover the entire rest of my shift which went until close. We were also short on staff for reasons I won't explain for anonymity's sake, so she likely had to cover all my shifts for the next week or two as well. Considering she always liked to force us to work holidays and whatnot whilst simultaneously claiming she couldn't because her kids were so important to her, it felt pretty good to deprive her of the ability to do that anymore.",

One of the other workers there whom I never knew who we'll call Steve quit just like a couple weeks after I started for reasons I don't know and was never replaced, then sometime later another of my coworkers that I did know that we'll call Mary was 8 months pregnant and had the baby a month ahead of schedule which left us suddenly severely shorthanded. Meanwhile she had the same excuses as to why she couldn't work certain days and why we should be able to. Then when I got berated and wrote up for something completely out of my control then insulted I thought on it for a half hour then took my badge off my lanyard, clocked out, said I quit, then walked out. The manager whom I didn't get along with got away with treating me like that for so long (and probably still gets away with treating my replacement like that) because she was renowned as a master unfucker. She took the store which was apparently really poorly managed before she came along and made it functioning and efficient. She even left from time to time because corporate wanted her to spend a couple days doing similar things to other stores in our general vicinity. In other words, her problem is that although she's apparently great at whipping a crappy store into shape, she didn't know when to stop the damn whipping! I actually have one more absolutely insane story about her given to me by one of my then coworkers, but it doesn't involve any petty revenge. And I do mean insane. It puts anything she ever did or said to me to absolute shame.",

But she never stopped to observe the employees working as an outsider looking in, and if something needed tweeking just say it to the employee that needs it in a polite way.  \n\n\n  \nI have a friend who used to work for Sketchers, and she was well loved by the company as the one who could fix up a failing store and get it to being a success within four months, she would be sent off to another store that was failing and shipshape them in four months. She always knew how far to go with the team and any that was not shaping up to be the best that they can be, were let go at the end as they were not improving. She would tell the new manager of that store to call HQ if the store goes backwards, which all of them never did after she came through. But she knew when to back off and when to step in to encourage the employees as a manager should be.  \n\n\nA good manager will have great employees. A bad manager will have no employees in the end.",

    "postText": "So to set this up I work at a gas station in a small Midwest town. We have homemade soup and chili made fresh Monday through Friday. My bosses are the most amazing kind souls I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. This place is great to work at and most the customers are gems. There are just enough employees to run all our shifts and we are all close and get along. There is this one couple who pushed me, a extremely polite helpful person to my breaking point.\n\nThis couple drives a small bus everywhere they go and try to be treated like royalty. They regularly come in and talk poorly of the above mentioned amazing owners. That didn't set well with me but didn't affect the customer service I pride myself on providing. Well after time I was informed how they were rude to my colleague that also rubbed me wrong. My coworker had just put food out on the warmer and they walked in. They asked them to make them the exact items that were just placed in the warmer again.\n\nMy coworker is nice but is not willing to be wasteful if something doesn't sell we have to toss it. Since they were fresh she refused to make them again. The couple went to the other worker who is a people pleaser who to avoid conflict just made the items. I wasn't impressed how she didn't support the other coworker when these people aren't entitled to preferred treatment.\n\nTo explain they have been kicked out of all other local  places to eat except the one restaurant in town. They just don't go there as they don't want to pay their prices. Also my gas station is not a cafe. We put food out in the warmer as a it's there if someone wants it kind of thing. In the afternoon there is usually one employee working, so cooking things isn't a major priority when you have to approve gas pumps handle customers and complete other duties. We get pizza orders but you can tell them it will take however long to account for prep time.\n\nSo they want cheap food, restaurant treatment, they steal refills of soup which are not discounted as we lose money if people don't pay for every cup there as we use real meat and good ingredients. They steal drink refills and help themselves to anything they consider they can or want to. We estimate they steal almost 600 worth of merchandise a year. \n\nAll that aside I've tried to be polite and treat them well. They pushed my last button when they noticed me talking to one of my locals who is a little special needs and came in the next day asking who they were. After I figured out who they meant they said they were debating amongst themselves whether they were a man or a woman. The blatant rudeness took me back a bit. I told them firmly that it wasn't any of there business and ended the conversation there. \n\nFast forward over the next few weeks. They would call to see what our soup was, if I answered I'd say we were out. They asked if I could make them something special I'd say I had other stuff in the oven or a pizza order and not make them anything. Well one day instead of calling, as I walked away from my counter I heard the bus pull up. I instantly thought that the soup was still out, I ran over and grabbed the hot pot and high tailed it to the back. They came in and said the soup was gone and since there was nothing in the warmer maybe I could make them something. I told them I was just going to put a pizza in.(I was not doing a pizza at all.) They left and I immediately text my manager and explain what I did. She knew how horrible these people are and found it hilarious.\n\nFast forward again a few more weeks. It's my day off but I'm getting gas and using the ATM. Their bus pulls up between the pumps and my front door which is not a parking spot. She walks in and I say that it's not a parking spot. She says she knows and walks over to the food area. The person working is new and didn't pull the soup yet. It was over an hour after it should be pulled. She walks out to re park her bus. I calmly go grab the soup and take it to the back, and pour myself a big to go cup of it. As I go back up front and am getting a fountain drink her and her husband come in and noticed the soup is gone.\n\nShe asks about it and I say it had to be pulled as how long it had been out. She then says you guys must not really want us here. It being my day off and being done with them in general say very clearly and not under my breath at all \"not really\". She flies off the wall and rounds the corner yelling how do you like your slippers. A little dumbfounded what my slippers did in this issue. I firmly tell her to get out of my store.  She screams how do you like your fing slippers at me again. I raise my voice which never happens and say she can leave my fing store or I'll call dispatch. She leaves loudly complaining. I immediately text my same manager explaining the situation and my response and said I'd accept my punishment. She laughed and considers it the greatest thing ever. I'm not the stores hero apparently",

Her being the kind person she is just absolutely does not want to ban them. I commend her kindness but these people definitely don't deserve it. She apologized profusely about me having to put up with them. I told her if she didn't do something about them I'd quit because I refuse to serve them. She contacted them and they are at least not allowed in the store when I work now.",

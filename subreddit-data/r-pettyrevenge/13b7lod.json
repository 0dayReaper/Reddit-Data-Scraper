    "postText": "I used to run a restaurant/bar where we would have weekly salsa nights and turn the place into a club. Some of the guests this attracted were not ideal, and one day we had one such guest.\n\nThis woman gave a hard time to one of the bartenders, cutting in front of other guests and then after being served, claiming the drink was too weak. She got into an argument with another guest saying that guest took her seat, even though she didn't leave anything on the bar top or seat while she was away at the dance floor.\n\nFast-forward one hour and I'm called over by a bartender because this woman is now demanding her drink be remade due to her dropping it while dancing (yes she was dancing with it in her hand). She looks like she doesn't even need another drink, and should likely be cut off.\n\nThe second I come over though to talk to her, she asks me if I'm the manager and when I say yes she says I have to make her another drink because she dropped hers. She's very rude, but luckily we have her card behind the bar so she can't refuse to pay.\n\nI tell her we're not going to remake anything, unless she purchased drink insurance. She looks shocked and says what the f*? I repeat, did you purchase drink insurance? If not, oh well. She was closed out, and left, all while saying how she's never going to come back. Never saw her again, somehow the place remained in business despite this.",

    "postText": "This is a long read but I promise it is so worth it!!\n\nIn high school my senior year was rough.  My mom was born with a severe spinal deformity and she was injured in a boating accident the summer before my senior year.  The first of several surgeries to save her life was scheduled for the first day of school.  I was not even sure if she would survive.\n\nI was also having severe health problems of my own and had to go to many specialist appointments.  I was blacking out regularly among other issues and they couldn't figure out the cause.\n\nOver the summer I emailed all of my teachers for that year letting them know what was going on.  I explained that I would be absent the first week of school and also miss many other days throughout the school year to take care of my mom and myself.  However, I was willing to go to office hours, study, and do work from home to make sure I was able to pass the classes.  I wanted to check with teachers and make sure they felt this arrangement would work.  I told them if they had any reservations about this to email me back and I would change classes.  All but one teacher (my physics teacher) had taught me in previous years and all of them knew me in some capacity and knew I was a good student.  Every single teacher emailed me back saying they would work with me through this time and help me and I could take their class.\n\nA little background about my school's attendance policy.  There were excused absences which were only possible with a doctor's note.  There were unexcused absences which is when your parents call to say you were sick.  You could get an unlimited number of excused absences.  After 10 unexcused absences the teacher had the option to fail you, but they didn't have to.  There were more rules but they are irrelevant and I don't remember them all.\n\nI missed 10 days very quickly and one day I came into my physics class and my teacher told me that I was going to fail his class because I had missed too many days.  I would have to drop the class or he would fail me.  I explained that the date to drop a class without failing had passed and we had discussed my absences before the school year started and he was okay with it.  He said he didn't realize I would miss that many days (the exact same number he agreed to in my email) and I was failing (I had a 99%).  He tried gaslighting me.  He sent me down to the office and told me to drop the class or I was getting an F.\n\nI went to the office and the attendance lady talked to me.  I explained what happened.  She agreed the teacher was wrong.  She asked if I had anything to prove that I had been at the hospital taking care of my mom during those 10 days.  She wanted something to cover herself so she wouldn't get in trouble.  The only thing I had was my crumpled up visitor name tag from the hospital.  She agreed to take it and then changed all but 9 of my unexcused absences to excused absences.  The teacher could no longer fail me, unless I missed one more day without documentation.  I was so relieved and went back to class.  My teacher was pissed.\n\nEvery time I missed class for that point out he would meet me at the door and interrogate me on my absences.  I got annoyed so I started giving made up excuses for why I wasn't at school (I got creative, there was magic and time travel and everything) and he would send me to the office.  I would turn in a doctor's note showing I was at the doctor for myself or my mom and go back to class.  He was so mad but kept waiting for me to trip up one day so he could fail me.\n\nHe was not a very good physics teacher.  He would spend hours on narcissistic rants about how he was better then everyone else.  When it came to physics, very few of the students understood his lectures.  After his lectures the other students would come to me and a couple other kids for us to explain it so it actually made sense (because he was too busy playing Candy Crush to help students with homework so I did it).\n\nThere were less than 2 weeks of classes left when I missed my last day of school.  I turned in a doctor's note as usual and my teacher was mad.  I came into class and asked him what the assignment was from yesterday.  He refused to give me the assignment and told me if I had been at school I would know.  I didn't really care because I was still getting a 99% and even if I got a 0 on every assignment left I would still pass the class with an A.  Since I had no assignment I  finished my work from another class and then started playing video games.\n\nMy teacher told me I had to work on my assignment but was still refusing to tell me what it was.  I got angry and told him \"at this point even if you tell me the assignment I don't care, I am not doing it. Period.  I am passing this class with an A either way so if you are going to act this way I'm done playing your games.  Now I'm going to go back to playing video games\". He was angry but stormed off.\n\nAt that point my partner for the class explained that the last assignment was a group assignment and we were in a group.  She explained that she needed me to do the assignment with her because it required at least 2 people and she was getting a C- and barely passing.\n\nAs a favor to my partner I agreed to do the assignment but I still had to figure out what the assignment was.  Most of the kids didn't understand the lecture well enough to explain it to me and the few kids like me that did understand it well were absent the day he assigned it.  I finally found someone who knew the assignment and they explained it to me.\n\nThe assignment was to shine a laser in a prism and measure the angle at which the light bends.  I started doing the assignment and every time I did the assignment I was getting a 300% error (basically if the answer was 1 I was getting 300 so I wasn't even close).  In this class if you couldn't get an assignment right you could copy off someone else only if you could explain why it worked for them and not you.  I went around the room looking for someone to copy but every single student had a 300% error.  And interestingly all the errors were almost exactly the same number.\n\nAs I was doing the experiment I noticed some flaws in the set up that were attributing to my error value and asked the teacher for different materials to work with.  I didn't realize he had personally designed the experiment and I told him \"I think the design of this experiment is flawed and also I think we should use fine point sharpies and\".  He cut me off.  He was severely offended and started yelling and told me the experiment was designed perfectly and I was not to question it or use different sharpies.\n\nIn my homework it asked me to explain why I got a 300% error.  I explained in detail how the design of the experiment had caused my error.  I went so into detail that I measured the size of the sharpie point and the size of a fine point sharpies and explained how improper design and poor materials provided were the cause of my error.  I did sample equations based on if I had used a better sharpie.  I explained that this was the reason for the all the students getting the exact same error number.\n\nThe next question in my homework said \"based solely on your experiment and your percent error do you believe in the physics law of light refraction\". I wrote a long paper on why I couldn't use this flawed experiment to determine if the law was true.  However, I pointed out the the question stated I HAD to use the experiment to make this determination and only this experiment.  I explained that based on this experiment and the fact that every student had a 300% error I did not believe in the laws of physics.  I then wrote a long paper about how I had disproved physics.\n\nI got an F on that assignment and a 98% in the class.  I got all As and Bs that year which was a lot of work considering both my mom and I were in and out of the hospital and my dad was abusive.  My class partner got an A on the assignment since she had done it without being petty and passed the class with a C minus.  My teacher was greatly offended and wrote me a very angry email insulting me.  He tried to explain that I cannot disprove physics and I should have explained how the law would have worked with a good experiment.",

I ask turn what in, and he said the paper he gave me one of the days I was trying not to die. Told him he didn't give it to me and his response was either have it on his desk by the end of class or I fail the whole class and have to retake it next year. Didn't even give me a copy, just expected me to pull it out of thin air and put it on his desk in like 30 minutes.\n\nJokes on him though he got fired the next year and the class got dropped due to budget cuts so I ended up having to do world civ/religion with the most laid back no fucks given teachers imaginable. I didn't even have to show up for the class and I would still get an A, as long as I could name the 3 Abrahamic religions and point to different countries on a map.",

I missed 4 days due to a severe allergic reaction, my mom informed my teachers, and everyone of them, except Mr M, let me take the final on the last day. Mr M refused to let me take it, because \"It's not my problem you weren't here\". Even with hospital documentation, he wouldn't budge. I had a high A in the class, so I still passed, but it messed up my GPA which 20 years later I'm still a bit salty about. I heard he was denied tenure a couple years later.",

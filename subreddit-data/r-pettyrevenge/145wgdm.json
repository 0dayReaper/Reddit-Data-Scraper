    "postText": "Asshole offered me a job, kept saying how well I was working and that he would take me on, then fired me on the second to last day. And he didn't even tell me that himself, but had to ask. \n\nI wanted revenge, so I decided to record tapes where I published all his little sometimes illegal secrets.\n\nAfter the tapes, I reported him to the tax office because he illegally employs Polish workers who work more than 12 hours (illegal in Germany).\n\n\nI broke this motherfucker and threw him to the wolves. Just like he did with me, firing me without warning!",

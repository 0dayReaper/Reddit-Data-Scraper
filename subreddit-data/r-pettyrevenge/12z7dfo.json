    "postText": "This story is a bit lengthy but I'll try my best, I'll throw some TLDR parts in throughout the story. Also, this isn't an attack on landlords or me calling landlords shitty people, just a story of how I dealt with one shitty landlord.\n\nI move to a city in the Mid-Atlantic during the pandemic, wanted to rent a place short term (six months) because my partner was going to move to the city as well and we'd need a bigger place. Just needed a small 1bedroom to hold me over until then.\n\nFound one, exactly what I needed. Signed the lease for six month duration, paid security deposit &amp; first months rent, and moved in. The unit was one of four in the building, all owned by the same landlord. It was the last unit and I was happy I could occupy the last unit and certain the landlord was happy their units were full.\n\nInitially no issues, was enjoying my time in the city, and living life. Shortly after moving in I noticed the door knob to my back door wasn't working properly, small fix I thought I'll pull out the screwdriver/drill and fix it. Didn't work, so contacted the landlord to let them know the rear door knob needed fixing. Essentially it wasn't fastened on there well enough because the hole for the lock to secure to was too big, so anyone could walk up to my back door and just jiggle the door handle and it'd fall off. Landlord responded, sent out one of their handymen to fix the door knob only for it to keep falling out just days later. First issue unresolved, and first notice on my part the landlord was going to be \"passive\" with issues, it appeared.\n\nFast forward six weeks, I keep being woken up in the middle of the night by what sounds like a royal rumble match happening from one of my upstairs neighbors, this happens multiple times. After the fourth or fifth time, I go up stairs and knock on the door in the middle of the night and ask the neighbors to keep it down, no response, they don't answer. Problem persist, and days later there I am banging on the ceiling of my unit with a broom, classic. I know it sounds like a relatively small issue, but it's not a one time issue, and at times it sounds like a border line domestic abuse issue, I could hear arguing and yelling, followed by some loud thuds. Not saying that's what it was, but that's were my tired/sleepless mind went.\n\nSolution, let the landlord know that one of their tenants is causing a disturbance and it's been going on for some time. Landlord is understanding and will send out notice to tenants about noise control and does. Problem persist, I continue to let the landlord know. Landlord returns and says they can't do much about it. I let them know I'll be notifying the police when the disturbance happens again, the city has a noise ordnance, I just wanted to give the landlord a heads up on my next steps.\n\nProblem happens again, I call the local law enforcement, they come out and knock on the neighbors door letting them know their getting complaints and then leave. Problem happens again, and I call law enforcement again. Landlord sends me an email stating that I could get in trouble for \"abusing\" 911 for these sort of issues, and that'd I'd need proof of the problem. Ok great, I download a decibel meter on my phone and when the noise happens again I flip it on, record the decibels, along with the argument and rumbling causing the noise, and send it to my landlord as proof.\n\nNo resolution comes my way so I inform the landlord I'm leaving the unit because of the ongoing noise problem, my problem is there's one month left on the lease.\n\n\\#############################################\n\nTLDR Part 1\n\nMove into a six month lease, have loud neighbors, I try to resolve it myself with no luck, I tell my landlord and they don't do much. Only course of action is to leave the unit, breaking the lease by one month.\n\n\\#############################################\n\nI inform the landlord that I'll be out soon, they come back saying I'm obligated to pay rent per the lease. I understand that it's during the pandemic and some landlords were struggling, but I don't want to pay rent for a place I wont' be living in. My compromise, I let the landlord know they could keep my security deposit, which was exactly one months rent. They don't go for it, they're trying to hold me to pay the rent for the last month I'm there. I do my research, in the city where the unit was located they have fairly good tenant rights/advocacy, and I wanted to know my rights.\n\nSo I do my research and there's hope! I find a city code called \"Covenant of quiet enjoyment\", essentially stating it's the landlords right to provide a level of quiet enjoyment to their tenants. My mind, \"ok, I've let the landlord know that there's someone breaking this 'quiet enjoyment' and they've failed to resolve it (negligence), so the landlord failed to up hold city code, therefore I can walk away legally. Sounds right, right?\" I know I know, what is the landlord supposed to do?!? How can they stop this?!? Well the landlord owns all four units, so they could notify the tenant who's causing the problem, and then serve them with an eviction if it persist. I'm making it sound simple, it's probably not, but also it's not my problem anymore, I'm moving.\n\nWhile doing my research I also find another bit of information, all landlords who operate any rental unit in the city are required to have something called a Basic Business License (BBL). Essentially this BBL is for tenant safety, it's not insanely expensive, and in order to get one a city inspector comes out ensures the place is up to code and can be occupied, again for tenant safety, and gives the landlord a BBL. This is public information, if you rent in the city you can go to the city website and put in your address and/or the landlords name and a BBL should pop up for the address that you put in.\n\nI put in the address that's on the lease I signed, no BBL pops up, I think \"that's odd, wonder why?\", it was my first time doing this and I just thought I must be doing something wrong, so I put in my landlords name, again as it appears on the lease, and again nothing pops up. Ok, the landlord must have one and I'm doing something wrong, let me call the city office to verify. Call them and guess what? they can't find it either, and that's when it clicks - I'm slow I know - ooooo they don't have a BBL. Well if they don't have a valid BBL at the time I singed a lease, is the lease valid? Because landlords are required to have one in order to operate a rental unit.\n\nAfter I find this out, I find all this out in about four days the quiet enjoyment code &amp; the BBL requirement, the landlord continues to email me letting me know I'm still responsible for the lease &amp; rent. I respond requesting that they provide me with the BBL for my unit, it's also required to provide BBL to any tenant who asks for it, the city even has a Tenant Bill of Rights stating this, which I provide them a copy of. The landlord goes dark for a few days, I keep sending them emails asking for the BBL and they state they'll provide it but it doesn't change my situation. I tell them I look forward to fulfilling my request and I'll refrain from communicating until it's provided.\n\nA day or two later the landlord emails me letting me know someone is interested in viewing the unit and if they can have it shown. Finally, the landlord is coming around. Ok, I'm walking away from my security deposit, I'm fine with it, and moving on.\n\n\\#############################################\n\nTLDR Part 2\n\nLandlord is still going to hold me responsible for lease, I even offer my security deposit as a compromise with no avail. I do my research and find that I have a right to quiet enjoyment (weird I know) which isn't being met and find out that landlords need a license to operate a rental unit in the city, I find out the landlord doesn't have one of these, and ask them to provide it. After asking for license, they realize this isn't working out and want to show the unit to new tenants.\n\n\\#############################################\n\nHey! You won, why is this still going on, does this ever end? Almost there, but I applaud you attention thus far, it gets better. Plus I'm going for a record for Reddits longest post, kidding(?).\n\nFinally, I'm out of the unit. Partner came to town, we found a great unit literally two blocks over, and coast is clear. The landlord left me alone, probably found a new tenant and is slightly annoyed but all good. Two weeks after I moved out I come home from work one day and see an email in my inbox for the landlord, oh boy.\n\nMy landlord states that the AC window units aren't in the closet, I never installed them because it was over the Winter/Spring season when I moved in so no real need for AC, where they should be. Odd, because when I left I distinctly remember seeing them in the closet and thinking \"I'm sure this landlord is going to try something, I better get some pictures\". I let the landlord know that the AC units were in the closet when I vacated the unit, if they're not there I'm not sure what happened to them.\n\nThe landlord persists, informing me that I still owe them for the final months rent, and now I also owe $600 for the AC units since I was on the lease and their missing. Landlord states what they're 'willing to do for me', split the cost down the middle and move on. Dude, you had one months rent in the form of security deposit and a vacant unit to fill, why do you keep coming for me? Ok, now I'm pissed.\n\nBelow is the exact email I sent my landlord in response....all names are fake.\n\n*Alex ,Thanks for your email.I was hoping that we\u2019d have this behind us by now; unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case. So here\u2019s what I\u2019m willing to do for you, below you\u2019ll see a course of action that I\u2019m pursuing for your awareness.*\n\n1. *Filling for a hearing due to your negligence as a landlord, which I provided a Notice of Violation for back in March and nothing was done about said violation, which forced me to move out. I\u2019ve already started the process, John from the cities Tenant Advocacy Office told me these do take time so better to start it sooner than later with the city court system. This hearing would be to recoup my security deposit and what the city calls \u201crelocation assistance\u201d, which is given to tenants who must leave their unit due to landlord negligence.*\u00a0\u00a0\n2. *Reach out to the city's regulatory affairs office and inform them of the rental units being operated without the proper licensing in the city limits. I can provide proof with the lease for the unit I rented, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have questions about the other three units in the building you own, as well as the house on Madison St* (again, did my research and found another rental unit the landlord operated without a BBL) *that you have listed under your name. I\u2019ve already reached out to them to verify if you have any valid BBLs for those listings, and they couldn\u2019t find one, which is why I imagine you\u2019ve yet to provide one for my unit.*\n3. *I\u2019ve discussed with John , Tenant Advocate advisor, the issue with your A/C units and showed him evidence* (the pictures I took before vacating) *that they are in the unit. His advice was to seek guidance from local law enforcement as this crosses the line from a civil matter to a criminal one, he thinks this is fraud and I tend to agree. I have a call scheduled with Lt. Anderson from the local law enforcement later this week and will be discussing the matter with the Lieutenant and sharing with them your previous email along with my evidence.*\n\n*Here\u2019s the deal, provide my security deposit back in full within 48hrs and I\u2019ll not move forward with any of these items, I was forced to move out due to your negligence and I have a right to have my security deposit returned to me. You can use my email address to send it via PayPal, I\u2019ll check it 48hrs from when this email is sent and if I don\u2019t see it, well I\u2019d take that as you\u2019d like me to move forward with my course of action. If you send me any more emails, even a reply to this one, I\u2019ll move forward with this course of action. I wanted to move on from this Alex, unfortunately you had to force my hand in this matter. Return my security deposit or don\u2019t, it\u2019s your move.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo hours later the security deposit was in my inbox and I've never heard from them again.\n\n\\#############################################\n\nTLDR Part 3\n\nI move out, the landlord says AC units are missing (they're not, I have photos of them in the unit prior to vacating) and I still owe them final months rent + cost for AC units. This pisses me off and I threaten him with three courses of action, going to court for landlord negligence, informing the city office of the landlords lack of license, and discussing with the police about the AC units because it could be construed as fraud.  Tell landlord to return my security deposit or I'm moving forward with these actions, two hours later they return my security deposit.\n\n\\#############################################",

And I know it sounds like a \"you live in the city, what do you expect\" sort of situation but I couldn't get more than 3 days of consecutive days of sleep because they'd keep me up. Hopefully they got kicked out, but who knows by now.",

    "postText": "TLDR at the bottom. Kinda long.\n\nA few years ago I was looking for a gun safe. Turns out there's a local craftsman in my area who is building custom safes at a reasonable price, advertising on FB Marketplace and Craigslist. John has a bunch of pictures and videos of his builds - everything from tiny pistol safes to vault doors for walk-in gun rooms. Small business, local guy . . . what's not to like? I talk to him in person, check out some of his current products and he walks me through his shop. He seems legit so we strike a deal for him to build me a nice medium-sized safe. It'll take a few months, he tells me.\n\nThen I make a **big** mistake. I pay three installments over the next three months and he has all my money up front. Go ahead and tell me in the comments what a dumbass I am, I earned it. (Also, baka is \"stupid\" in Japanese, so r/UsernameChecksOut )\n\nOver first few months, John periodically emails me updates with pictures of his progress. It's going a little slower than he'd promised - the safes are a side gig for him - but he's a one-man show, running a small-time operation. I understand that life gets in the way sometimes, and I'm flexible.\n\nSpoiler alert! A *lot* more of his life starts to get in the way. His wife leaves him, he loses his primary employment in town and has to go work in the oil fields, etc., etc. It's one thing after another, so 6 months in I gently open the door to a possible refund but he continues to insist \"completion is just around the corner, I just need a little more time.\" I get it, life is messy, and I've been on the receiving end of the shit stick more than once so I let it go on for a few months.\n\nJohn strings me along out to about a year before I give up and just tell him plainly \"I want my money back.\" Sure, I feel bad for him and his changed circumstances, but he's got my money and I still don't have a safe. I'm flexible, right up to the point where I'm not. He tells me he won't refund, so I start finding creative ways to apply pressure.\n\nJohn has stopped responding to my emails, won't answer calls from my number, ignores my texts - he wants to get stupid. My Army platoon sergeant used to tell me back in the day - we can get stupid, but I've got a lot more experience at it than you.\n\nRemember those FB and Craigslist ads I mentioned earlier? Let the fun begin! Every ad he has up gets a mirror image ad from me, but with \"SCAM\" scrolled across the top and bottom. I grab all his keywords (including his company name) and tuck them into my ads, so anyone searching for him or his products will find my ads too.\n\nI do a public records search, checking for any complaints that I should've found *before* contracting with him - BBB, Chamber of Commerce, whatever I can find. There's nothing in the normal places, but I dig up something unexpected and even better - his name and address pops up in a public proceeding transcript (legal stuff). It's all there in black and white on the screen, but it's pure gold for me! Turns out a few years back, John was fired from his job at a high-profile public service run by the local government - he got caught sleeping on the job and also got caught lying about completing work he never did.\n\nI revise my FB and CL scam ads, adding a link to the public proceeding along with a couple of quotes from the transcript that detail his wrong-doing.\n\nEven after all this, I still can't get my money or my safe. I turn up the heat a little more by paying a visit to small claims court where I file a claim and get a hearing date. This part isn't really revenge, it's just to legally force him to engage with me. The judge orders us into mediation. John comes in with no documentation other than the sales contract and tries to equivocate about a bunch of things - not quite lying, but definitely not telling the truth. All throughout, he's pissing and moaning about my \"John's a scammer\" ads - looks like I really got into his head with those. I have all our emails and texts printed out, tabbed and cross-referenced in a folder, and I use that to knock down everything he says. The mediator realizes I have a slam-dunk case and asks me what I want.\n\nMe: I want my safe, or I want my money back.\n\nMediator: John, what can you do to make this right?\n\nJohn: Money's tight, so I can't give him a refund, but I can finish the safe in about two months. Outside of that, I really need Baka to take his ads down - he's killing my business!\n\nMediator: Here's my decision. Baka will take down his \"John's a scammer\" ads until this is over. John will deliver the safe to Baka within 90 days. If John fails to deliver, Baka will be awarded triple the amount he paid. \n\nJohn and I both agree to it. I'm peeved about having to take down my ads, but it looks like this is the only way things will move forward.\n\n90 days come and go. In news that will shock absolutely nobody, no safe shows up at my door. I start filling out the paperwork to get my judgement, but can't get time off work to file it at the courthouse. I get an email from John about 3 weeks later. \"The safe is done and ready for delivery, do you still want it?\"\n\nShould I, or shouldn't I? After the visit to small claims court, I'd talked it over with my wife and a couple of realities became obvious. First, above anything else I need a gun safe. The safe is arriving late as hell, but better late than never, right? Second, I might be *awarded* a monetary judgement . . . but lord knows if I'll ever see the money. Repayment could take years. Best to just take the safe if he can deliver as promised, and be done with the whole sorry episode.\n\nI decide to accept the safe and John gives me a delivery date . . . which he promptly misses. Twice. 3rd time's the charm, though.\n\nJohn finally makes good and delivers the safe within a few weeks. And strangely, when he arrives he treats me like it's just business, we're buds, and acts like there's no hard feelings. Maybe an old head injury? Who the hell knows. Anyway, as he's installing the safe he tells me all about how business has dried up for him in the area - and it's like he's completely forgotten my role in that. He then tells me because of the work situation here, he's sold his house and he's moving back close to family in another state, leaving real soon.\n\nSo I get my safe, John's out of business, and he's leaving town. I guess it's a win, but it sure was painful getting there. The safe still works great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I try to buy a custom safe from a local manufacturer. The builder tries to stiff me. I get the safe anyway, ruin his business, and he leaves town.",

He has to start all over again in a new town, far far away...\nHe's probably still trying to scam others . . . People like this rarely learn their lesson, especially if they keep repeating the same type of BS",

Combined with his work history, which I didn't learn about till later, I realized he wasn't well-equipped to deal with all the adversity and he just mentally shit the bed. Hell, I've been in a places where I found myself in the middle of a shit-storm and had to muddle through, which is why I was so patient. Up to a point.\n\nTo his credit (can't believe I'm writing that) he did show up at court. I half expected him to just leave town and I'd never see the safe or my money.

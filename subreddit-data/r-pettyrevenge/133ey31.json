    "postText": "The property I live on is pretty big for the area, most people barley have a yard and mine takes up a corner block.\n A few years ago we had neighbors move into the house behind mine across the alley.\n  I bought an air rifle one year and was using my own shed to sight in the scope.\n The police show up at his place and then walk over to me, say there have been complaints and I asked if there was any property damage which I would pay for, they said there hadn\u2019t been but \u201cwhy don\u2019t we just put it away for the day and try to find somewhere else to do what I need to do another day\u201d I complied.\n   The next day said neighbor was outside mowing his lawn (his back yard). So I waited until he was done and started mine, started in the front and ended on the line for the alley, side feed on the mower open.\nI didn\u2019t pick up any paper, cans or cardboard in my yard I just ran it over and blew all that confetti into his yard.\n\nEdit: I am by no means a rich kid or anything.. I live in Canton Ohio\u2026 my grandfather bought the place in 78 my mom inherited it and I\u2019m told I\u2019m next to get it\u2026 and with todays housing market I\u2019m doing what I can to fix what my grandfather procrastinated on so my mom is comfy now and it\u2019s not a huge money pit later",

They were taught proper care for tools and firearms were considered tools. I raised my children with the same respect for firearms and taught them how to take care of and be cautious of firearms and knives. They are tools, and needed for many things. That isn't taught much anymore, it's all weapons, instead of tools and that is one of the problems.",

    "postText": "A Gentlemen (use the term loosely) has a phone number almost identical to my wife's phone number.  2 of the numbers are flipped.  My wife tracked him down on Facebook and asked him numerous times to fix the issue with creditors, companies, dental offices, etc.  He told her to stop bothering him and he would do whatever he wanted.  \n\nCue PettyRevenge:   I simply mentioned to her,  if he is not worried enough to give people the right phone number, instead of correcting them,  tell them whatever you want....  Like tell them he passed away 2 weeks ago....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeems the number of calls she has been getting has been dropping.  Then again,  he is having to prove he's not dead yet either.",

I moved to an apartment and when I got my phone number for my land line (hey it was a while ago), I  started getting buried by calls from doctors, creditors and collections after about two months.  Collections was the worst. I did get a call from a mortgage company during peak ninja loans. I told them very plainly that it was not her number and that I constantly get tons of collections calls for her and to not loan her money. A couple months later they were calling threatening to send things to collections. To which I told them this still isn't her number and I warned them not to lend her money. \n\nI did cancel a lot of her doctor appointments though. It also generated probably the only good CS story about comcast. She had used my number to set up cable and when trying to sort out billing issues that caused due to the fact that I too had used it to set up cable and internet, the CS guy said he couldn't tell me anything about the customer, but what he was hearing is that I wanted to cancel my other account that I was no longer using.  I guess he flagged the account somehow too, because in all three years of this, it was the only thing that got her to call me up and curse me out.",

When the phone book was printed, their number wound up on the left page and into where the binding was, and the 7 looked like a 1. Lol. We got so many calls for the pest control. We would just correct them, and being a small town at the time laughed with the owners of the pest control about it.",

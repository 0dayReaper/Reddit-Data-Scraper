    "postText": "January of 2020, my partner and I and, a mutual friend moved in to an old house that was for rent.\n\nBeautiful heritage house, cheap too because it wasn\u2019t furnished and the paint needed work. No garage or car port.\n\nWe adapted to the place fairly quickly in the first few weeks. Sometimes, we would chat with our land lady. Sweet, kind, considerate and showed interest in my wife\u2019s work - a painter.\n\nLock down happened and we got stuck there. Crap, there\u2019s no washing machine and dryer yet, had to hand wash all our stuff and air dry them.\n\nLand lady was very helpful, provided us with clothes pins and allotted us space in the yard for our clothes.\n\nHere comes her husband- the landlord. He\u2019d turn off our water supply after we had filled the drums he provided for us.\n\nOkay, doable but annoying. Then at times there was no running water for two weeks and we had to really budget our water. He said he doesn\u2019t know why but he has control of the main valve.\n\nTried complaining to the local council but, they were too busy with the pandemic.\n\nWe toughed it out for six months. Until restrictions on lock downs loosened.\n\nI was sitting on the porch just enjoying the view of the garden on a good morning. Landlord sits beside me and tells me stories of how he built the house with his father, inspiring stuff.\n\nThe way he ended it though was the last snarky remark he made. \u201cLook at this house, it\u2019s making me money while you young ones don\u2019t have a house and are hard up. Well, no buying a house anytime soon for you though, given how low you rent this place from me.\u201d\n\nI just said yeah and continued to enjoy the view.\n\nThe very next day I turned in my two weeks notice to the land lady, we were moving out. \n\nThe land lord came out of his house and asked why we were moving out.\n\n\u201cOh I was having my house built while we were here, it\u2019s done now.\u201d\n\nThe look on his face was indescribable.  A minor win but, the satisfaction was great.",

            "comment": "Years ago my landlord, who promised when we moved in that he wouldn\u2019t raise the rent often, did in fact keep doing that. We were month to month for 5 years so nothing was in a long term contract. We complained of course (and were excellent tenants), but he always made excuses about it. \n\nWhat he didn\u2019t realize was my aunt had passed away and left me her house (Thank you Joan). We spent a year longer in the rental to get the old house fixed up and gave him 30-days notice to leave. He was furious we didn\u2019t tell him all that time and now he had to go through the expense of preparing the house and finding a new tenant. Maybe if he\u2019d offered a lease instead of making us fret every month, we would have obliged, but eff him. \n\nHe also tried to ding us on things to keep the deposit, but after I mentioned I had photos of every inch of the place when we moved in, he changed his tune. He\u2019d initially taken first and last month\u2019s rent plus deposit. He not only wasn\u2019t going to get additional money for that last month, but the deposit was as much as rent, and he had to pay it to us right after we left. Good times.",

            "comment": "I just purchased a house 3 weeks ago. I've been renting for 6 years from a slum lord who doesn't even live in our state, he comes out twice during the summer for \"repairs\". He owns 6 houses and 2 apartment units in the area, he's around for 2 weeks. When I moved in 6 years ago he told me he wanted to get out of being a landlord and I have told him I would buy the house outright or do a rent to own agreement with him so my kids could grow up in the only house they can remember. He's told me for years that he would sell it to me. Feb 2023, I ask him again if he wants to sell the house and he says yes. 3 days later he asks if I'm willing to buy the house, but not the garage which has a 2 bedroom apartment above it that he rents separately. Of course I'm not because why wouldn't I want the garage that's ON THE PROPERTY. He inquires about if I'd be willing to let him build a new garage on the property and rent the land that the current garage sits on for 30 years. So lose 1/4 of lot for current garage, 1/4 of lot for new garage plus new driveway to it. Again, no thanks. I offer to have my realtor who has been showing me houses appraise the house and garage and come up with a fair value, and he agrees. After 3 days my realtor says he hasn't been able to reach the landlord to set up a market valuation (he was willing to get a ballpark value for house, garage, and both together to be fair in pricing, for free). I call my landlord and he tells me he's no longer interested in selling me the house because \"he makes way too much money between the 2 addresses to let them go\". Ok it's a business standpoint for him and that makes sense. Now I'm looking at houses almost daily, we find the house we want , put in offer, it's accepted,  we work on closing. During the whole process I'm kind enough to let landlord know that I will not be renewing my lease, and he says he understands. The day of closing I call and text him to inform him that I'm closed on the house and since I'm paid through June 30th it will be my last day. He inquires of whether I need 1.5 months to move out and I told him that no I don't and if he would like to pro rate rent I can be out in a weekend and he can finally do the work that hasn't been done in 6 years (porch falling through, knob and tube electrical, literal mushrooms coming from the leaking ceiling that he wouldn't authorize me to get fixed and said I should cover it in duct tape, the whole works). He then calls me greedy for not being willing to just let him keep June's rent money and also move out early so he can take his time fixing the house and that \"if he can rent it out earlier than July he will pay me what new tenants pay for june\".\nI will be moved out most of June and I informed him I will be available on the 30th to give him his keys back. He came to replace a shorted out light fixture and commented on the repairs that need to be done and asked if I changed my mind to let him start early and I told him that even if I'm moved out early I won't give him the keys early because you never know when I might want to stop by to be alone with my wife before the lease is up since I have to pay for the whole month anyways.\n\n\nTLDR:Landlords suck and they aren't your friend, put yourself first.",

Place burned to the ground due to electrical fire in another floor (I lived in the basement luckily, so I didn't lose *everything*) and landlady tried refusing to return my deposit \"well I know you aren't leaving it in good condition\". Like I get this situation is shitty for you too, but do you really need to go to small claims on top of all this mess? I unwittingly ended up renting a little unit that was adjacent to her actual home and boy was she pissed about it. Dunno what changed (insurance money hit?) but she came and apologized one day and actually offered me some good paying handyman work so I guess it worked out alright.\n\nLived in one great rental for a couple years, got a couple promotions and was starting to think about being able to buy. Landlady told us a few months ahead of time they weren't renewing the lease as they wanted to sell. We loved the place so I offered to buy the house. Got scoffed and laughed at, she needs someone *serious* who can afford a mortgage. Penciled out at being less monthly for the mortgage than rent but ok lady. Besides that she's sure it will go over list so she'd be stupid to take my offer and completely ignored me for the next couple months til we were fed up and moved on in the search. Well that was around 2008 and so she ended up selling for ~20% less than what I'd offered, whoopsies.\n\nNext spot was a 6mo lease with verbal agreement to go month to month after. Good location but janky old house. Landlords seemed great, kept talking about how much the month to month would suit both parties, etc. They were just putting off repair work until they'd milked the last penny of rent they could without doing it, basically. Backed out of the month to month when they found out we were looking to buy. They're \"only concerned with renters, if you think you can be an owner then obviously you can figure out where to live on your own\". Ok bud. \n\nThen we actually ended up moving to take some different jobs in a much more expensive area. Rented from this nice seeming guy who (napkin math) owned 5-10 mil worth of rental properties. I wasn't about to trust it, so we had planned the home buying out so that we'd know we were going to close by the last month of the lease to prevent any further landlord fuckery. Welp this dude was actually cool as hell about it. When I told him he was super happy for us, talking about how it's his favorite way to lose good renters. He came around shortly and took a quick peek at the place and just wrote us a check for the full deposit so we'd have a little extra money for closing or whatever. Offered to tack on as much time as we needed to the lease, and if we needed help with abc then call xyz and tell them Peter sent you. Got us a housewarming gift and his mom baked us some tasty treats as well. Restored my faith in humanity a bit lol.",

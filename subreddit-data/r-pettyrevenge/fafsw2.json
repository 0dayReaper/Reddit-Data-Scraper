    "postText": "I\u2019m in a class where a group research project/presentation is a huge chunk of overall points. Everyone knows in group projects you always have that one slacker who doesn\u2019t do anything that you have to compensate for. However, I got stuck with possibly the worst 3 people to be in a project with in the class. \n\nI did the entire research, presentation, poster boards, etc among many other annoying things myself. I tried talking to them and telling them they needed to put in their share of effort. Ignored. I\u2019d send them tasks to do, ignored. I\u2019d try to schedule meetings, they\u2019d say they were coming and then leave me alone at the library. This happened from the get go. It was abundantly clear that they expected everyone else to do the work, but \u201ceveryone else\u201d turned out to be just me. \n\nRule: we couldn\u2019t have things 100% memorized word for word, and we couldn\u2019t read off of anything. We had to actually know the subject. I was fully prepared to do most of the talking and even wrote down a small script for them and told them to know what to say during their part, at the very least. The night before I told them we had to meet to at least go over the whole thing one time. Once again, none of them showed. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m livid and decide they can just do it themselves, which means they\u2019d get up there, not know a damn thing to say other than the small info I gave them, and couldn\u2019t even bullshit anything because they did no research. Thing is, if we miss without an excuse, we fail the project. If you have an excuse, you have to have documentation. \nI commute and live an hour away, so I decide that I\u2019ll conveniently have a flat tire right before class. Went out and actually bought a tire so I could have the receipt to prove it. Emailed the professor, who said I can present by myself during his office hours. Turns out, they completely bombed, and not only probably failed the project but since they\u2019re bad students might even make them fail the class.\n\n***edited to say: the professor stated at the beginning that we were not allowed to contact him about people slacking in the group, and said to work it out amongst ourselves. Said that we were adults and that he wouldn\u2019t even respond to emails about it.",

We had one rehearsal the day before presentation and I was worried the 4 people didn't do their part or wouldn't show. They all showed up, with their parts ready. Turns out they just really sucked at communicating. It was a relief but I was also annoyed that they had me so stressed, lol.",

Me and one other member did his whole part for him we just needed him to present it somewhat decently or our grade would suck. Dude turned out to be an amazing presenter. Still sucked we had to do his part, but at least he cared enough to properly understand his part were he could present it well and field questions.",

Amazing charisma, will absolutely razzle dazzle the prof and keep the audience from falling asleep.

Was a group coding project, he did his part sent it to me to do mine and asked me to just tell him when it was done. This was an intro class at community college, I had taken CS in highschool so easy review for me  It was a super straight forward project and I had a couple of days so naturally I procrastinated til night it was due. He texted me while I was working on it that night, I didn't see it so he got no response. The poor lad proceeded to slave away for several hours until midnight completing my part just for me to finally respond like 15 min before submission that I was done \n\nI apologized profusely and he was thankfully quite understanding. We just had to explain to the prof why he got two submissions in his email and to ignore the one just from my partner because it was meh. Never heard from prof and we got an A so worked out in the end at least.",

The breakdown is we pick a country and explore birth, death, and migration rates, as well as the country's economic status and how this affects said rates. The chicks and I did our parts to the best of our ability. The dude pulled no-show moves at every turn: didn't have a sitter, didn't have a ride, etc. So, we went on without him. And we let the professor know that he had contributed nothing and we wouldn't be putting his name on our work. The professor made the guy be his own group and he had to do about 35 pages worth of work on his own, presented over 4 parts. It was satisfying.",

Our fourth member has vanished off the face of the earth and only checks in on the group chat to ask how to do the homework assignments that are due online. She\u2019s also brand new to the field, no background, no experience. Four weeks in and our professor (expert in the field) has already said that we don\u2019t need to include her anymore and that he\u2019ll make her do her own assignment. Turns out she hasn\u2019t even done the training and qualifications to be allowed in the lab at all. If she had been in there with us, the department would have gotten in serious trouble. So we\u2019ll probably never see her again and can now get work done.",

While the groups could meet up and discuss their projects in person, they would have to check in online and write about what they achieved in those meetings. Most of the discussion had to occur online so if a person wasn't pulling their weight, we'd know it. People who didn't participate in their groups would be moved to the slacker group after a few weeks. The students would have to grade each other on their individual work once the project was over. \n\nBecause I was TA, I was in all of the groups. So was the professor. You'd be absolutely amazed at how many people gave me a bad grade. Even more amazed at the number of people who graded the professor badly for not pulling their weight in the project. \n\nWhat surprised me the most was the number of slacker groups who did a remarkable job on their projects. They did lose 10% automatically, but often that was all they lost because they did really good work. I imagine it was a lot of students with social anxiety that managed to push through.",

The only real restriction was that because of harassment issues in the past all discussion on the project had to take place on each groups sub forum on the main subject forum where it could be monitored, and marked.\n\n\nHalf the group studied on campus the other half were off campus it was meant to provide a mix of situations similar to what you might encounter in the real world; but the on campus students just abandoned the forum in favour of their own group emails, and meeting on campus and decided to ignore the rest of the group. They got a warning from the lecturer to return to the forums when they hadn't posted anything in weeks which they did, acting like martyrs because they'd been doing all this work together to plan the project, which we had also done, it took a week, and the lecturer threatening to fail the entire group on the collaboration portion of the assignment to come to a compromise, both halves absolutely hated each other by the end despite us all actually doing the work. \n\n\nI don't think I've seen people miss the point of an assignment so completely as they had; the entire point was to communicate professionally with people through different mediums in different locations, and to make it work, it was the whole reason the work requirements were so loose.",

I had a group paper (which is already stupid because people tend to have different writing styles even under the same rubric) and trying to get it done online was such a pain. One of my group mates texted about 2weeks before the paper was due at like 1am stressing about the paper. The group as a whole was like \"can we discuss this in the morning at a more reasonable hour?\" Thats the last we heard from her until the literal due date. \n\nI hate group work for the most part because it rarely accurately mimics real world situations.",

Part of my degree involved me doing a lot of research into collaborative learning which involves group projects. Group projects, when done correctly and completed by students who all pull their weight actually show a marked improvement in student learning and outcomes. However, designing them that way is not easy and controlling for awful student behaviours is beyond a teacher\u2019s ability. \n\nFrom what I have read, group projects are best placed in a multi year program and only towards the end of it when most, if not all, the slacking students have been weeded out.\n\nI run group projects in my first year programs but I get around this lazy student problem by not having the group project worth marks. Instead the group project serves as a mechanism to teach the students how to accomplish a series of tasks in class. Then afterward the students complete an individual project that encapsulates everything learned in the group project. This way I can assess them as individuals while still gaining some benefits from collaborative learning. The under achieving students still fail because they don\u2019t learn anything during the group assignment and therefor struggle with the individual assessment.",

It was here I finally said he's been ignoring any attempts by me to establish contact since the beginning, and that I had the same issue with the other group members prior to them dropping. Thankfully he promised to grade our contributions separately if I informed him prior to turn in what we each worked on. \n\nI got an A. The last remaining group member did not.",

The assignment was to review the problem solving techniques (this was for math) written in our book, post a blog about it summarizing the techniques in our own words, then pick a problem from our book and solve said problem using said techniques. Each person in my five man group had to do this and be done by the \u201cfourth day\u201d of that week. That way you had three days to read your group members posts, reply to them with corrections or some kind of thoughtful response. We were going to be graded as a group for this. I was literally the only one that posted anything. \n\nBy the third day of the week, I emailed my group and gently reminded them that this assignment was a group assignment and that it was due by midnight the following day. After the fourth day, when no one had responded to my email or posted, I emailed my group again reminding them that we were going to be graded as a group for this assignment. No one answered. I emailed my teacher after the week deadline was up and asked how this was going to effect my grade since I did my work but no one else did and therefore I had no one to respond to. She emailed me back saying that she noticed that and she would give me full credit for the assignment. I can only assume the other group members failed but obviously she isn\u2019t going to tell me that. \n\nTLDR: I hate group assignments.",

            "comment": "I signed up for a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Information Technology several years ago.  We were assigned the same \u201cTeam\u201d for the entire time we were working on our degrees.  We had the first presentation during the first Quarter of school.  We started out as a team of Six.  One person quit the program, leaving us with a team of 5 for the rest of the time that we were earning our degrees.\n\nWe split our first presentation 5 ways, with each person presenting their part.  I was terribly near-sighted and was on the schedule for Laser Eye Surgery (yep, for real).  I told them that I would need a week afterwards to rest my eyes, so I wouldn\u2019t be in class, but I would do my part of the project and be there to present it on the day.  \n\nThe laser place told me that I would be able to use a computer right away within a day or two after the procedure.  I knew that they were full of crap \ud83d\udca9 and planned accordingly, taking a week off of work and school.\n\nI had my part of the presentation done and ready to go the following week as planned.  I showed up in class with my material and was surprised to see my group doing the presentation without me!  I asked them afterwards, \u201cWhy did you leave me out of the Presentation?\u201d  They responded with, \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure whether you were going to show up or not, so we just did your part for you.\u201d\n\nI was pissed.  My \u201cTeam\u201d had my phone numbers, my email and everything and never bothered to contact me to see if I had done my part or even to see how my surgery had gone.  I decided right then and there that I wasn\u2019t going to earn a degree working with a \u201cTeam\u201d like this for years.\n\nI was already disappointed with the school\u2019s performance and the lack of training that we were getting to begin with.  For example, we had a \u201chardware\u201d class, but we weren\u2019t allowed to take apart the computers.  What?!\n\nBut the treatment that I received from my \u201cteam\u201d really cinched it for me.  So at the end of the quarter, I announced that I was quitting the school and they became a \u201cTeam of 4.\u201d",

I has scheduled meet ups for a few different times in case people couldn\u2019t meet for whatever reason. The project was to create our own religion, so it had a lot of moving parts to it, and was a lot of work! I volunteered (idiot me) to make a presentation, and just asked that everyone have something to say for their slide and provide the info and any pictures they wanted to add. Of course out of the gargantuan 6person group only 2 people aside from myself participated. And I pretty much BS\u2019d all of the missing pieces. I was so beyond livid on the day of presentation. We got a pretty decent grade for the project as a whole, but she did grade us individually, as we had to do a write up of our individual part of the project. And one of the people in the group that didn\u2019t participate, got pissed at me, because the presentation didn\u2019t fit with what she wrote, and I just ripped her a new one about if she had emailed or texted me at the least, we could have fixed it. But what was I to do? I\u2019m not a tattletale, so I didn\u2019t say anything to my professor. But I was pissed about the idea of 3 people getting a decent grade for doing nothing, but cause me stress. I so wish I had thought of something like this\u2026",

Our presentation comes up, we're all stressing tf out because the prof quit halfway thru the semester but we still had to so the project but with almost no guidance. One of the dudes who barely participated or contributed doesn't show up until 15 minutes into a 20 minute presentation, then stumbles through his singular slide because he literally didn't know what was on it. \n\nMinus his slide, we knocked it out of the part, and got rave reviews from the dept staff who were very impressed with how well we knew our project. 99% of the time, we had answers to their questions, and it felt so good to be able to say, \"we haven't discussed that yet\" or \"we won't be going over that in our presentation, but it *is* in the report/essay if you get a chance to go through that\"",

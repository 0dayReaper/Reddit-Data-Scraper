    "postText": "I went to high school in a suburb of a large city. The burb was a new \"master planned\" monstrosity, but it was huge city adjacent. We had to drive about five miles to get to the closest mall and shopping centers. Every single time she saw anyone who remotely resembled my age, she would point at them and ask if I knew them. \n\n\"Do you know them\"?\n\n\"Why would you think I know them\"?\n\n\"They look about your age\".\n\n\"If I knew them, don't you think we would have acknowledged each other\"?\n\nShe would make such a scene. It was mortifying. \n\nWe were at a cafeteria on a Sunday afternoon. The after church crowd came in and so many really old people came in. I started pointing in their direction and made a point of being somewhat loud saying\n\n\"Mom, do you know them?\"\n\n\"Why would you assume that\"?\n\n\"IDK, they look about your age.\"\n\nShe looked at me in shock and started to get mad until my dad started laughing and told her to stop asking me if I know every teenager in Texas.",

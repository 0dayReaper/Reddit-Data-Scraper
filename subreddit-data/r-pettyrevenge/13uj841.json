    "postText": "I had a classic Cadillac that I had been restoring. I had already completed all of the interior and the exterior body work and paint. I had the engine out and was slowly rebuilding it. The car sat in my driveway beside my garage. This is about the time a new neighbor moved in across the street from me. A few days after he moved in I received a violation to the city ordinance that all vehicles on private property must be fully registeted and licensed. When I called the city wondering why after more than 2 years, they were hassling me. I was told there had been a complaint. So I threw a cover over the car. A week later I got another violation. The cover wasn't enough. I moved the car to my back yard, parked it between 2 sheds with the cover\u2026.another violation and this time there was a fine. I took it to court. I was told that the ordinance was clear. No vehicle could be parked on private property unless it was properly licensed. It was part of the blight laws. It cost me $250.\n\nSo I got even with the city and my new neighbor. I owned the lot next to my house and generally used it for family gatherings. I now decided that this would make a great place for an art exhibit. I moved the car to the front of that lot, put it on a foundation, and painted it purple, pink, and green. I said it was an art sculpture and let them take me to court. I took a pic of Cadillac Ranch in Texas as one of my exhibits that my car was a piece of art. The judge agreed and that work of \u201cart\u201d stayed in my yard for the next 8 years until I moved.\n\nGoogle Image Result for https://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/images/tx/TXAMAcadillac_1188_620x300.jpg\nImages Cadillac Ranch, Amarillo, Texas www.roadsideamerica.com Images may be subject to copyright.\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/EiASCbojWTEJteMX9\n\nEdit.... This happened back in the 80s, so no digital pics. I did have 1 or 2 Polaroids of the \"art\" and quite a few of the original car. Unfortunately, after nearly 40 years and several long distance moves, they have all been lost. I made my final move a year ago and am still going through boxes that have been packed for a couple of decades. Maybe those pics will turn up yet.",

All of them got thrown out because there was an exception in the ordinance for antique vehicles. When the code compliance officer threatened to cite him for parking vehicles on the front lawn (per neighbor\u2019s complaint), he responded by paving the entire front yard and filling it with antique VW\u2019s in all stages of repair.",

You already have a problem here, Karen is driving through the neighborhood looking for houses to buy, she sees a car on the front lawn, which is seen by some as trashy regardless of the car. She decides not to buy, repeat that same thing with everyone coming through and all of a sudden a big investment for many people has been devalued.\n\nSecond thing that happens is joe bob down the street sees it and is like oh shit cars on lawns yyyyeeeaahhhhh!!!!! And puts out his rusting shit cars on some cinder blocks out front and more follow. Your nice neighborhood is now starting to look like a trailer park, nothing wrong with trailer parks, but home values of a trailer park aren\u2019t what you want to sell your house at. \n\nIn other words you\u2019ve gone from a nice neighborhood to a redneck af neighborhood and many people lose a lot of money. You could try to say \u201cok only *nice* cars out front\u201d but then you have to decide objectively wtf is nice or not. Joe bob thinks his shit heap is nice, why is everyone being such a jerk?\n\nAnd the arguments continue until everyone loses and has taken up way too much goddamn time with this bullshit. So it\u2019s easier to just be like listen, no fucking cars on your lawn!\n\nIt\u2019s the same deal with HOAs. I fucking hate them when they tell me my grass is 1/4 mm too long, but they\u2019re alright when Ricky and Julian down the street decide they want to let their house go to trash and lawn look like a jungle.\n\ntl;dr it\u2019s all about house prices. People want to win on an investment and these rules are so everyone wins. But people can also use them to be shit bags.",

One neighborhood had four or five houses on the block with multiple cars in various stages of repair in their driveways and yards.  Another was next door to a house that had a couple junkers in the front and a backyard full of cars, boats and junk.\n\nI see a house that has a yard full of junk and I wonder how considerate they'll be about things like noise.  Sure there's a chance they're cool, but I'm not going to take that risk with such a large investment.\n\nBoth of these houses were priced tens of thousands lower than other similar houses.",

But maybe if the house is really dilapidated and has numerous easy entry points, I guess it is possible. I just find it bizarre since I've grown up around them all my life and never had any issues. Have seen nice get into places I've lived and worked though, absolutely.\n\nJust to be clear I never lived anywhere that had a ton of junk on a nearby property, but there are tons of city regulations against stuff like that in the places that I lived. \n\nI do know a guy who runs a small garage on his property, but he doesn't have a bunch of junked cars everywhere. Customers come and go though, which I definitely could see as being an annoyance for a neighbor trying to sell their house. \n\nRegardless people are justified in complaining sometimes. Most of the time I've heard or seen people get busted by the city for things it seems super petty. It's usually a smaller thing and the person just doesn't like them and ratted then out. (\ud83e\udd23 Rat)\n\nIt's unfortunate because I'd say it's just as common for neighbors to weaponize stuff like this against neighbors they hate than it is for the city to actually be getting involved because of valid reasons.",

I will say I live on 5 acres mostly wooded, but have been here for over 20 years and it only took once for me to run off any squirrels that get near my vehicle now.",

I'll be honest I always lived in less rural places so maybe I just got lucky and they went and fucked with someone else's wiring harness instead of mine, but they're everywhere here like literally all over the place. Probably the most frequent animal out and about that I'd see on any given day.\n\nI'll be honest I wouldn't take one as a pet but I like them for the most part. I've never had any issues with them. My old work was located on a massive plot of land with enough parking for a booming telecom company that operated in the 60s to 90s but eventually the parking lot became a ghost town relative to those days. So we'd see the squirrels everywhere. They'd dig through the trash to eat people's Tim Hortons muffin wrappers \ud83e\udd23 that seemed to be their \"go-to\" thing. Could be they had such ample amounts of garbage food that they didn't need to attack our cars.\n\nIt must be annoying for the people who change the garbaged when the bag is full but all ripped up and shit \ud83e\udd23 regardless I definitely learned something today. I never thought for a second my car could be in danger by them.",

Check out some of the comments below my original one - junk cars (like ones put up as statues lol) attract mice and pests that can get into somebody else\u2019s shit that had nothing to do with it.

It's why our debt to GDP ratio is now HIGHER than 100%, which until now was unheard of and a very very bad thing. It's to the point that there is no non-destructive way to fix it now because so many people have wrapped their entire retirements around the idea that the values will always go up, so now we're stuck between fuck over the old folks relying on housing prices for retirement or fuck over everyone else who can no longer afford housing because LINE MUST ALWAYS GO UP.\n\nWe can't even just say fuck the housing prices and replace it with government pensions because all of those ARE ALSO BACKED BY REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS! Can't even just build more housing, because that would devalue existing housing prices, which, again, can't happen because line must always go up or peoples retirements are fucked.\n\nIt is so unbelievably fucked at this point, and is literally the biggest case in point for WHY housing should never be treated like an investment. Commercial properties? Fill your boots. Residential? Absolutely fucking not.\n\n&gt; And it\u2019s nice that you don\u2019t care about people\u2019s money/investments but like it or not it\u2019s how society works.

We're pretty much riding this wave until it crashes itself or we crash it intentionally. I think crashing it intentionally would at least let us keep a hand on the wheel, so to speak, but I no longer see a \"it doesn't crash\" option.",

It was a request for information, and if the government didn't answer on time you'd get a compensation. So if you filed a complaint or you applied for a job and in the last paragraph you had snuck in a request for information they could have missed it. So then some cities had to hire people to go through all the mail that came in to make sure they answered all questions because people found a lucrative loophole to exploit.\n\nYes, it was that stupid. There's a new law that replaced the old one as of last year. I'm not sure about the differences between the two laws.",

Here is how it works: people buy houses, they are expensive and have to get loans to buy them. **Some** neighborhoods should you choose to live there have a Home Owners Association that governs what is and isn\u2019t allowed in the neighborhood. They can be annoying as fuck. But they also place bylaws that prevent idiots from doing stupid shit that ruins the neighborhood. People aren\u2019t out there trying to make millions off their home for greed, these are just normal people that want to be solvent and not in debt, so some people prefer neighborhoods with HOAs and some people dont.\n\nI\u2019ve lived in both and they have their pluses and minuses. As much as i\u2019d like to trust my fellow neighbors some of them are complete fuckwits and with 0 rules they\u2019ll have rotting sheds, broken down cars (which attract pests), and do crazy shit that can make a neighborhood look horrible to live in. This effects normal people not millionaires.\n\nOn the other hand HOAs are fucking annoying, and they are in fact there to place rules on the property you own, which can be infuriating. I have had it out with HOAs before (one was being quite racist) but i have also had to  talk to my neighbors about dumb shit (don\u2019t leave your dog chained up all day outside, it\u2019s cruel) where an HOA would have been useful.\n\nSo in actuality it is a personal decision whether you want to live in a \u201cmanaged\u201d neighborhood or not. Yeah, it is about investing in a home, but investing isn\u2019t evil, it just means you want to sell the house for the same or more than what you bought it for, which is reasonable.",

            "comment": "Same here. My neighbour fixes cars and sells them and we have an elderly community centre at the opposite of my house and an electrical factory so there is space to park for the centre and factory. The centre closed down so now it is abandoned and my neighbour has always had a vehicle to pick up cars. Once he picks up cars, he brings it to our street and he fixes them and leaves them in those spaces for months and eventually sells them. He usually has 3 of those cars and 2 of his own personal cars so there is less places for us to park. He has no driveway or garage either which makes it worse. My dad is too scared to report him to the council as I'm pretty sure this isn't legal",

            "comment": "My neighbor keeps sending code enforcement to my door. All my cars are registered and licensed and all tires hold air so there's nothing they can do to me. But they on the other hand have 3 junk cars without licensed and registration all on weather rotted tires down on the rim and nothing is said to them. The other day code enforcement stopped and told me they had a complaint again. I'm going to give it a week and send pitchers to code enforcement of the neighbors cars. They even have a striped out drag car body on blocks in the back yard. I'm not sure why people can't mind there own business but I'm going to start complaining too. There are 4 of us on this block that are car guys and someone( my neighbor) is always complaining and we are actually up to code they just don't like that our cars run or something. It's frustrating.",

            "comment": "If a machine shop has a 55-gallon drum of cleaning solvent (hazardous \"material\") that they dip parts in to remove the oil and coolant after a block of aluminum is machined, it slowly gets dirty. Once its swapped-out for a fresh drum and set aside it is \"hazardous waste\" and must be properly disposed of in 90 days, or there is a HUGE fine.\n\nWho decides when it is too dirty, and has become \"waste\"? You don't want to schedule a pickup and transport to a hazardous disposal facility for just one barrel (with all the proper permits and paperwork), so...you wait until there is enough drums from various departments to make a full load, and THEN you swap them out.\n\nNow, the area where the drum of clean solvent is given enough room to hold several drums of \"product\", not waste. Its not waste until I SAY its waste...right?\n\nUsed motor oil might be commonly considered a hazardous waste, but...even if its dirty after its swapped-out of the cars engine, you can still use it to fix a squeaky hinge, so...its not waste until I SAY its waste.",

    "postText": "So, a while back I was in an English class, and I had a sub teacher. Now this teacher in particular has a reputation for having good hearing, but being surprisingly chill we call her T. The guy in question (I'll call him A) was basically annoying to everyone and nobody liked him. He's the type of person who yells rumors abt u from the other side of the class and there are too many ppl to tell that it's not true.\n\nOnce when T was patrolling around the classroom I decided it might be funny to get A in trouble, so as the teacher walked past us, I coughed and said teacher like *cough* teacher *cough*, and this conversation followed.\n\nT: \"who's gaming\"\n\nMe: \"what?\"\n\nT: \"you coughed and said teacher, who were u trying to warn?\"\n\nMe: \"ohh.. I was talking to A\"\n\nT: \"show me your computer, A\"\n\nAt this point the class knew what I was doing and  i saw some people giggling slightly.\n\nA: \"see! Nothing, he's lying!\"\n\nT: \"switch desktop please\"\n\nAt this, A was shocked that a teacher knew about that and played dumb. \n\nA: \"what?\"\n\nT: \"give it to me\"\n\nT proceeds to check his other desktop and gets very angry, but none of us knew what was happening. \n\n\nA couple days later we found out that A had a certain adult type of anime open on that other desktop, and he got in a lot of trouble, I'm not sure the exact details but I think it was about 10 detentions(I'm sorry I dont actually know)\nAnd his parents definitely got contacted.\n\nSorry about some of the conversation, I did change it a little to make it clearer and easier for people to read. \n\nTL:DR: an annoying person annoys everyone so I play a joke on him that ends up with him being found with adult anime on his computer.",

We warn our students that if they use a proxy, anything they type in such as password, email, whatever, is fair game for harvesting. No one is going to set up a proxy server and spend thousands on buying and maintaining it and providing connections out of the goodness of their heart. A few always learn the hard way.",

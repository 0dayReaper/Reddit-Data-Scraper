    "postText": "Edit: This is my first time posting in this sub, hopefully I got all the formatting right.\n\nThis goes back about 10 years ago, shortly after graduating college.  I was working at my first job post graduation, as a host turned server/bartender at a local Peruvian Restaurant.  Family owned, with the original owner father (R), current owner son (D), and his other son acting as the General Manager (M).\n\nLet me start by saying: no one liked this family.  It was quite common for an employee to make a small mistake, and wind up getting yelled at by any of the 3.  I saw it the worst from D, but R was pretty bad too, despite no longer being in charge of the place.  I was lucky, as I didn't speak Spanish, and R didn't speak much English, so I never really had to deal with him much.  D and M however had no language issues, and were more than happy to cuss you out if they felt you deserved it.\n\nNow, many places have bosses like that, and I'm sure everyone reading this has experienced at least one abusive boss in the past; but this story isn't about abuse, it's about theft.\n\nYou see... M, despite being the manager, was also one of the primary servers for a very long time.  This was extra frustrating on the slow nights when there would be 2 or 3 servers and M, all competing for tables.  To make matters worse, he would often opt to take the larger parties for himself, and have the other servers try to keep up with smaller tables.  Since the rotation was set up to evenly distribute the number of diners between servers, this meant that if M took a party of 10, everyone else would have to take multiple smaller tables until they too had served 10 people before M would have to take anything else.  This meant he would do less work, serving fewer tables, but still get as much in tips.\n\nTo make matters worse was the tipout at the end of the night.  While we were never able to get proof, there was always a VERY strong suspicion that D and M were fudging the numbers after collecting the tipout money earmarked for the Busser and Bartenders.  Say the servers turned in $100 in tipout for 1 busser and 1 bartender; the bartender might get $45, and the busser might get $40.  Again, we were never able to prove this, as M would have a tight grip on the accounting sheet at the end of each night.\n\nNot to mention the fact that everything was paid under the table, no hourly wage for servers, kitchen staff being paid pennies on the dollar because they were \"illegal\".\n\nThe staff had various ways to make up for all this theft, typically involving collecting cash payments for certain beverages and other portions of an order, then \"forgetting\" to input it into the system.  While this did help offset the theft, it probably wasn't the smartest way to go about things.\n\nAs for me?  Eventually I had had enough.  I couldn't afford to keep getting paid next to nothing with student loan payments starting, and I knew my coworkers were all getting shafted too.  So I made a call to my local Department of Labor office and submitted a complaint for wage theft.\n\nTo say the family was unhappy would be an understatement.... when the inspections started up, they would scramble around, telling certain employees to leave, take a break, or otherwise hide so they could be kept off the staffing records.  See... they KNEW they were breaking the law.  And they KNEW they had just been caught, but they still thought they could avoid paying certain employees if they just kept them off the books while the inspectors did their thing.\n\nEventually, the DoL finished their investigation and ordered the restaurant to start paying fair wages, as well as a whole ton of back wages.  I think I ended up getting something in the neighborhood of $10k in back wages, paid in installments for the next year.\n\nBest part?  They never once suspected I was the one to bust them.  I kept working for them for at least a year or more after this, until I finally managed to find better jobs that could get me out of there.\n\nAnd it gets better.... after I left, some of my coworkers asked about my DoL contacts.  Seems they got \"missed\" in the initial investigation and wanted to reach out again to open another dispute.  Don't know what ended up happening with that, but I'm sure they got their fair pay as well.\n\nTLDR: Bosses screwed staff over by paying zero hourly wages and unfairly stealing paying tables, so I called the Department of Labor and got them on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars in back wages.",

    "postText": "My first \u201coffice\u201d job out of college was working as a visual merchandiser/graphic designer at a big iconic store in downtown NYC (don\u2019t want to say, it\u2019s an iconic store any New Yorker would recognise. It was such a fun job, I loved everything about it except my terrible salary and my supremely douchey young boss.\n\nHe was the worst. He was young, tried so hard to be cool, a total poser. Wearing band t shirts of bands he didn\u2019t listen to but thought were cool, wore glasses without prescription, pretended to know everything about fine whiskey, incorrectly correcting people\u2019s pronunciation, saying jif instead of gif, always mentioning the trendy barber/hair salon he would go to get a haircut. This was 2014, and he was a glasshole - he got a pair of google glasses and wore them constantly for a while.\n\nHe also always had a red paisley hanky folded neatly into a triangle hanging out the back pocket of his jeans. Clearly he didn\u2019t know what \u201cthe hanky code\u201d was, the signal gay guys used in 1970s-80s to signal what they were into (hanky in left pocket meant you were a top, right pocket you\u2019re a bottom, colour of hanky communicates what sex act you\u2019re into), he just thought it looked cool. He went around like this for more than a year, totally oblivious, and I never told him about the hanky code.\n\nI\u2019m a good illustrator, I did many graphics for the website and email campaigns, in-store signs and window displays using my own illustrations. On my last day, I made a little card for him and left it in his desk drawer for him to find later. I drew a couple of men\u2019s butts in jeans with hankies in different colours, and in the card just wrote \u201cGoogle hanky code\u201d\n\nI wish I could have seen his reaction when he found it.",

You know more about him so can make an educated guess as to his sexuality that we can not.\n\nThe person I responded to that acted like implying he was BI was reaching knew nothing about the hanky guy.\n\nAccording to a 2022 study 57% of those that identify as LGBT identify as Bi. So if you see a same sex couple it's more likely that one or both are bi not \"full gay\". Combined with 8% of all people and 21% of Gen Z identifying as LGBT that means 5-12% chance hanky guy is Bi knowing nothing about him. And the odds are increased for him due to the hanky, he either knows what it means or is likely around people who wear hanky's in their back pockets and thought it looked cool.",

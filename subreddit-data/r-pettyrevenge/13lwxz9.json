    "postText": "Necessary background: \n\nI'm a 28F working as a semi truck driver. I work for a contractor within a large mail carrier. As part of my job, I have my doubles endorsement which means I often haul two short trailers rather than one long one. There's a piece of equipment that connects the rear trailer to the front trailer called a trailer dolly. It's essentially a trailer axel, 4 wheels, and weighs upwards of 2000lbs. You can push them by hand but any kind of hill makes it really difficult without hooking up to equipment first. \n\nI had some scheduling conflicts with my last job due to child care issues and had worked out a resolution that included taking weekend shifts for the guys that wanted those weekend days off anyway. My boss fired me the night before my first shift off and waited until the end of the day to tell me that. He also insisted that I would need him for a reference for a future job if I wanted any chance at being rehired. However, I called some other contractors and was in a truck within two days. I happily waved at my old boss when I saw him. It was fantastic! My new job is great btw. \n\nHere's where the petty revenge comes in. I'm still giggling about it. Something to note with my old company is that they are local city drivers. This means that they only ever haul one trailer at a time so none of their drivers are required to have doubles endorsements, including the boss and his wife. They also are the only company that doesn't park their trucks in the bobtail lot, but actually parks back by where the empty trailers park. Our lot has been under construction lately and because of that, people have been leaving equipment out everywhere. \n\nOne day, I have to start my route with an empty trailer and the only ones avaliable happened to be parked back by where my old company parks and I found the nicest one avaliable. The problem was that someone left a dolly right in the way so I couldn't swing hard enough to not sideswipe a trailer or hit the dolly. I did was I had to do, and pushed that dolly a bit uphill 20 feet back so I could just barely swing the corner. That just happened to be directly in front of my old boss's nice Cadillac he had parked for the day for work. He is not legally allowed to touch, lift, or otherwise move one since he doesn't have his endorsement or training. I smiled knowing he would've dropped his last trailer for the day, drove all the way to the back of the lot to park only to have to turn around and go track down the shop. The guys that only move trailers around the yard are also not allowed to move dollies for the same reason. \n\nAnyways, maybe I can't really get back at them but hey! At least I can make the end of his day slightly more annoying.",

I tell them when I'm available week to week, and they find me a truck and a run. I'm upgraded to a fleet of newer sleeper trucks rather than a day cab. Plus, the boss is not a crazy micro manager. My pay isn't even any different than my last job despite fewer days working. \n\nThe cons are that I have to switch trucks a lot and that sometimes I work a night shift, but honestly, it's so worth it. \n\nThe funniest thing is that once I was fired, my boss started doing some weird things and had a string of bad luck. They forced all the drivers to sign contracts to work strictly m-f (including the part timer). 3 more guys quit due to that. They also managed to total two trucks. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.",

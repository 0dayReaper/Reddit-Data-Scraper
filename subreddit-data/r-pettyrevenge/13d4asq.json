    "postText": "I worked in a big department store, where it was well known that you were fired at 5 months and 3 weeks (health insurance kicked in at 6 months). They also had sales quotas you had to reach. If you reached it one quarter, then the next quarter, you had to sell as much or better. Make it? 10% raise. Miss it? 10% pay cut. But, since in the summer people buy for back-to-school, and right before Christmas there's a month of big sales, each quarter is set up so that you get a lot of sales one quarter, then fewer sales the next quarter, then a lot of sales, then fewer sales.  \n\n\nSo, you start at $10. Summer back-to-school sales? You have $11. But then fall sales? You go down to $9.90. Christmas sales? You're back to $10.89. Pay goes down and it just keeps going down despite cost-of-living going up. I spotted that as soon as they mentioned it in training, but knew I'd be gone by 6 months, so no big deal.  \n\n\nThat last month, I went from being one of their very best sales people to selling a $7 belt. I rang up every sale under my coworker's names. I did all the back-of-the-room work so they could focus on customers. End result? Every single one, about 6 people, made their quota and got a raise instead of a paycut. Floor Manager was a nice woman, also got a raise.   \n\n\nWhen I was brought in to be fired (they had to HUNT for a reason, they finally fired me for going home sick with permission from the manager an hour before I was supposed to log out)? I pointed out the $7 instead of $7000(ish) I normally made in sales, collected the paycheck, and walked off grinning. Already had a new job lined up and good recommendations from coworkers if I ever needed them, my coworkers all had raises, and the store lost a very good salesperson as well as had to spend the next 6 months (the next quarter was a big sales quarter) paying everyone that higher pay rate and then the bump for the big sales quarter too.",

So each of them is credited with $10,000 of their own sales + 1,666 or so of A's sales for a total of $11,666. They each get a raise. A quits as planned.

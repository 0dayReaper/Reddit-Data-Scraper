    "postText": "This story is about about someone that I supervised at work. I 56M had a friend I grew up with (He would be 52M now) that worked for me as an irrigation tech. We will call him Jay. That meant a lot of time out sweating his ass off in hot Virginia weather. One of our contracts was all the high schools in a local county.\n\nSo when you got to the schools you always had to go check in first with the AD and let him know you're on site and get any keys that you needed for gates and doors. It was a hot day In the upper 90s and Jay showed up at one of the schools to do some work. He talked to the admin who said the AD would be right out to talk to him and give him the keys. About 30 minutes later Jay went back to the office and said \"Hey is the AD coming?\"  The Admin said he would be right there but it still took another 15 minutes. \n\nOnce Jay got the keys He got to work and finished in about an hour and was soaked with sweat head to toe. He was still pissed about the AD making him wait. The keys he had were the AD's own set with a long chain to go around his neck with an access badge/ID. Jay knew that the AD usually wore them around his neck and a lot of times would even tuck them inside his shirt. So he took the badge and wiped it all over his ball sack covering it with his ball sack sweat. \n\nJay then went inside and handed the keys (only holding onto the chain with his fingertips) to the admin and said hey make sure that the AD gets these back. \n\nTLDR;  The AD made the tech wait in the blazing hot weather for 45 minutes so he wiped his ball sacks sweat on the ADs keys then gave them back to him",

They had a foreman who was a bit of a prick so they were always pranking him. They surrounded his VW bug with pallets of parts and hid the keys to every forklift but one. They left the keys in that one. The seat was wore out so you literally were sitting on the metal springs. They wired the ignition coil to the seat so it would fire up when he turned the key. Then one night while on break a group of them literally picked up his car and carried it up the pile of snow plowed up against the building and dropped it between the pile and the building. They were finishing second shift on New Year's Eve later that winter and he had been bragging about the formal party he was going to. While he was showering up and getting into his tux in the locker room they went outside with  liquid graphite that they used to line the flues when pouring iron and poured it all over his windshield. My dad said he came out got in the car started it up. lights came on. Lights went off. Lights came on. Lights went off. Then the windshield wipers came on. Then he got out and tried to scrape the window with his ice scraper. Immediately he was covered from head to toe with black graphite. The final straw came when a co-worker laid a big fresh turd down inside of his lunch pail. When he opened it up at break he was so pissed off he immediately went out into the shop and went to this guy's die table which had all his tools on it and started pissing all over it. Just about that time a big shot executive with a group of clients walked in on him. Immediate dismissal.",

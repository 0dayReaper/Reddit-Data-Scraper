    "postText": "A woman bought a designer handbag from me online, then about a week later sends an extremely rude message, claiming it had damages and smelled funny. She wanted her money back IMMEDIATELY, and demanded I send it to her on Venmo (against policy and massive red flag for fraud) or else she would file a chargeback (threatening sellers with chargebacks is also against policy). Being as it was the weekend, and her language was really abusive and gross, I decided not to interrupt my weekend and waited till Monday morning to respond, which is within the TOS.\n\nShe was really aggressive, and sent me more rude messages demanding I relent and pay her off site \"or else\". I checked her feedback and at least one other seller reported that she also tried to coerce them into an off site refund with a chargeback. Buyers have enormous latitude in online sales, and tbh, I just didn't want to deal with her anymore so on Monday I responded offering her a full refund in exchange for a free return, and though I did not believe she was being honest, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said maybe it was damaged in transit. I fully expected her to return the wrong item, but after I gave her a free return/refund option, she filed then a chargeback anyways claiming the item is not as described, then left very negative feedback. Both the feedback and existence of a chargeback claim harms my presence on the site and hits me with fees and an automatic refund for her, taking money out of my account automatically and messing with my budget. There's a reason why most sellers will do most anything to avoid chargebacks, it really is inconvenient and damaging for us.\n\nNow being as this used to be my profession, I know that it's considered fraudulent to file a chargeback when the retailer has offered a full refund. So naturally, I appealed the case and it was decided in my favor, and her refund was reversed. I blocked her and moved along. Fast forward about two weeks, and the original item shows up on my doorstep, returned, and without any of the damages that she complained about. Now. I realized in this situation I have no legal obligation to refund her at all, but better still, is that when I went to the seller dashboard to try, I don't even have the option to refund her because the case SHE OPENED was closed and decided in my favor. I still felt a little funny about relisting, so I emailed the site for more direction.\n\nApparently, when you file a chargeback you are forfeiting your right to seek a refund directly from the retailer in favor of seeking a refund from your financial institution. She had apparently messaged the site and modified my feedback to demand a refund after the chargeback failed, and sent them the tracking number of the item she ultimately returned, saying that since she had a tracking number they had to refund her. But a failed chargeback is final in this case, and because her behavior was deemed fraudulent, the website itself is not able/willing to refund her anymore either. The only way I could give her her money back was if I unblocked her, exchanged info, and sent the refund on venmo or paypal, which are linked to my personal email and phone number. Given how rude she had been I have no interest in opening up any unmediated communication, and I'm certainly not going to give her my personal contacts of any kind.\n\nSo by following through on her coercive threat to file a chargeback against me, she managed to lose both the item and her money. A chargeback is not the silver bullet people often think it is. If she'd been even reasonably polite, I'd have had no issue communicating with her directly to give her money back, even if she had filed the chargeback.",

Reviews should asses the value of the purchase and the transaction experience. \n\nI buy a fair amount of cheap chinese furniture hardware like drawer slides and hinges etc. the reviews will usually go something like this: cheaply made, instructions were bad, packaging sucked, but the price was right 5/5.  \n\n\nReviews like this are extremely helpful. It tells me exactly what to expect and whether or not they are worth the money. If a review for a set of Blum drawer slides (super expensive brand) said the same things it should be a 1/5.",

The reviews for the knockoff included a number of people whining about the quality. Well no shit! You paid $30 for a knockoff of a nearly $200 tool! I bought the $180 jig, which is made of solid aluminum, rather than flimsy plastic and sheet metal. \n\nYou get what you fucking pay for!",

I begged USPS to tell me where it was delivered. (As I understand USPS track the gps location on deliveries.) I begged the shipper to ask USPS. Both multiple times. They blew me off and claimed I was lying. I finally reached out to Amazon and they could see all my attempts to get the seller to do something\u2026 so they refunded me my money.

Any time we don't get a package that was out for delivery that day, I can see what time it was scanned as delivered. If it was delivered well before our normal mail delivery time, it was likely misdelivered. Plus most of our packages that get misdelivered are Amazon orders shipped USPS. In those cases, we get delivery notification from Amazon and when it isn't either in the mailbox or on the porch, it's only logical to call the post office for them to track back where it was delivered instead.",

Unfortunately there are networks within networks within networks that are checked before submitting a chargeback because there are some we are not allowed to do chargebacks on, either due to regulations or proprietary agreements. If it's a network we can't submit we just close in favor of the customer and eat the loss. For the ones we can technically submit the chargeback on we must investigate further for signs of either third party potential fraud (not the customer) or first party fraud (the customer trying to lie) and then move on accordingly. Rinse and repeat if the chargeback is sent back to us rejected. It can be both a tedious and interesting job.",

Even fighting vampires, where silver bullets are useful, you also need a stake (making a good faith effort to work with the vendor and let them help you) and holy water (a little bit of patience).

She felt I should just refund her because it was a fake (it was real). This went back and forth and the middleman company said wait until she returns the bag. She held on to it fighting to keep it and get her moeny back. Well she waited to long and the case was found in our favor as she never returned the bag. About a week later the bag arrives as I sent her a return lable. I spoke to the middleman company and they said I was under no obligation to refund after I sent pictues of the bag with ink stains and a gum wrapper in the zipper section. She used it for the holidays and tried to return it. She got nothing from me.",

It was supposed to be delivered to my home but, according to them, it sold out (it was a limited item) before they had a chance to ship it out (the item was bulky, so home delivery was the usual method, not physically in the store). I'm no longer in said state. They are offering me a full refund, but only if I go to that specific location since I paid there and they can only process the refund at that store, they don't have locations in my state. It's not a ton of money, but I also don't want to just let it go.\n\nIf as you say, it is illegal to request a chargeback after being offered a refund, am I SOL? I don't think they are offering the refund in bad faith, that is just how they work, but I also want me money back, but won't risk it if it would be a crime...",

It's always frustrating when people try to coerce sellers into off-site refunds or threaten chargebacks, but it's even worse when they turn out to be fraudulent. It's good that you appealed the chargeback and that the case was decided in your favor, but it's a shame that she still managed to leave negative feedback. It's also interesting to know that filing a chargeback forfeits your right to seek a refund directly from the retailer - I had no idea. All in all, it sounds like you handled the situation as professionally as possible, and it's a lesson to all of us to be wary of difficult customers and the potential pitfalls of online selling.",

I am not going to just send somebody money privately when I pay substantial fees to have a site arbitrate those issues, and if she did really want to go to court over it, I'd just refer her to the site itself.

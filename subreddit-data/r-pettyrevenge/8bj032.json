    "postText": "Waiting for flight to board at a major east coast airport. In walks this young, slick, LOUD business kid (early 20\u2019s?) on a conference call, shouting into his Apple ear buds. Drops his bag on the one free seat and starts pacing the floor, up and down the aisle, oblivious to dozens of folks eating lunches, working quietly, babies sleeping. Continues pacing and shouting, \u201cYup, yup, we\u2019ll upload that into the system .... blah blah jargon jargon acronyms and business bullshit\u201d annoying everybody around, making everyone else get out of his way. Folks start giving him the stink eye but his shouting and pacing continue, his circuit widening until he\u2019s walking out of sight, then circling back, still shouting into the air. \n\nAfter 20 minutes of this, I\u2019m over it. Kid stalks off in a hurried pace, abandoning his backpack for the three or so minutes it takes him to pace the terminal. \n\nSo I walk up to a TSA guard and point to the bag \u201cSir, there\u2019s an unclaimed backpack on that seat!\u201d Then I walk away. TSA starts making announcements, trying to find the owner of the bag, but douchebag business kid is too oblivious, pacing and shouting. TSA is already removing the bag when he realizes and chases after them. Too late, he\u2019s suspect and he has to follow them out of the terminal for a bag check. \n\nAnd now it\u2019s quiet again.

Every time he was asked to be quiet, he'd quiet down for a few minutes, then slowly build up in volume until he was shouting again.  \n\nThere were very few empty seats in the train, so escape was not an option.  He did this for nearly 4 hours, loudly enough to be heard through noise-cancelling headphones.  It was absolutely infuriating.  By the end of his call, the conductors came by to shut him up every 5 minutes until he finally gave up and hung up the call.\n\nSorry, I just had to vent this, your story reminded me of it.",

I use the foam tips and am dead to the world after the earbuds are in. I can turn the volume up one notch on my phone and hear the music fine. \n\nI recently got the Bluetooth cable and am pretty happy with it. You do lose some audio quality over wired, but the cable is tiny and has a good battery, 6-8 hours. The Shure 215 with the Bluetooth cable would probably be a good choice if your going to be bluetooth all the time. About $150. ",

However, it's still their responsibility to develop those skills.  You're going to be disappointed if you expect random people in public to provide guidance.  Because of factors like [diffusion of responsibility] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility) or even just the fact that most people do not want to appear impolite, you're not likely to get guidance.  There's also the [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error), which is the tendency humans have to assume another person's bad behavior is due to some intrinsic characteristic (that guy's being loud, what a jerk!) than an external factor (he has earbuds in, he can't tell how loud he is, maybe I'll go let him know). It's just how people behave.  If you want to avoid people making erroneous assumptions of you, developing those skills that allow you to present yourself well is going to be much more effective than expecting random assholes in your vicinity to let you know when you're annoying them.",

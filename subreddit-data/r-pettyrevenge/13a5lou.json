    "postText": "Pretty basic. Spent the night with a friend who just had a baby we were all woken up by her neighbor standing outside blasting old gospel in his yard at 5 am. Mama and baby went to see her mom who can't travel, and I stayed to clean up her house for her. The entire time I blasted stuff like Avenged Sevenfold, Black Veil Brides, Disturbed, Motionless In White and Five Fingsr Death Punch. All the doors and windows wide open so mister 5 am gospel hour got no peace. He came out and glared several times but never said anything. Pretty sure I scared the hell out of him, but that's what you get for waking up a new mama and her 5 day old baby.",

I don't usually blast music like that because I hate when others do it but you wake up a 5 day old at 5 am all bets are off",

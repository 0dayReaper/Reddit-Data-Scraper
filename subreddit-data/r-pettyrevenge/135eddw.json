    "postText": "Today is day 13 in hospital. I have a severe back condition &amp; awaiting surgery. Ive been on my new ward for about 5 days. Im the youngest there. Im in my early 40's but  young at heart. I have 6 kids &amp; I'm the sort of practical joke mum. Put fake spiders in their beds, sew up their pyjama bottom legs so they cant get in them etc etc. So u now know a bit of my personality. I live in chronic pain. I take Fentanyl, Morphine, gabapentin &amp; other drugs but cba to write them all but i try to be happy, jokey &amp; just take the p1ss out of everything really. Im the youngest in my ward. Im sharing with 5 others \"ladies\". I had got on well with them till today. We was chatting (well mainly 3 of them) i just chip in when i feel like it. Im too busy listening to Prime &amp; trying to build my Lego Ghostbusters car to be moaning about things &amp; acting more important than others. \n\nWe was talking about snoring. They said i snored. Ok i snore. I don't care. I rarely sleep well due to pain so if i get 3-4 hours sleep great. My OH doesn't moan so i cant be that bad.  I jokingly said \"well you lot snore but i don't moan about it\" &amp; laughed. Well cor blimey! You would've thought i'd done a \ud83d\udca9 on the floor! One of them said \"you lot, you lot\" &amp; the other one chimed in \"us lot....we are ladies\". I then did the Little Britain \"laydeeeeee\" thing &amp; laughed &amp; she said we are ladies, we are your elders, you should show your elders respect. I disagree. I think respect &amp; politeness gets muddled up. Im polite to people, very polite, but my respect needs to be earnt.  The woman next to me then said that I had my light on till 2am the other night. Yes i did. I had my light on in my area with my curtain around me but i was mindful &amp; put it as low as i could to not disturb her. When she asked how long i'll be, i tilted the light so it was darker in her area. I tried to respond but they cut me off &amp; told me the conversation is over. So tonight, i didn't bother adjusting the lamp &amp; i didn't care if it annoyed her. I know its not much but i can barely walk atm, barely sit up &amp; i'm weeing into a bag so let me have this little bit of revenge \ud83d\ude1c\n\nFirstly, do you think respect needs to be earnt by individuals or is it a given right? \n\nSecondly, any advice how i can get some revenge would be greatly appreciated as I'm being bullied by 3 coffin dodgers &amp; its really not helping atm as I'm missing my kids, family &amp; friends &amp; i'm feeling like a bit of a failure. I don't know whats going to happen to me &amp; I'm in constant pain so a bit emotional \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThirdly, I fell asleep before i posted this. I've not long been awake. Someone asked how she slept. She said \"not great\" when asked why, she said because of the light. I couldn't help but feel really pleased &amp; a smile spread across my face.

The guy across from him actually started moaning about not getting sleep. The rest of the bay had a go at this guy as it was one night and my partner hadn\u2019t slept for the whole time till that day. They brought up everything he had done.\n\nMy partner was glad when he got released.",

(It was the \"I'm broke and got shit insurance\" rooms.) My roommate kept her entire family there until 2am before a nurse came in yelling at them to get out. \n\nThen she had the balls to bitch about my newborn baby crying at 3am because she was hungry. Never mind her baby cried nonstop, but I didn't say anything cause it's a baby trying to adjust to the world of the living. It was a long 3 days... when we were released I begged my mom to watch the baby and promptly passed out on her kitchen table.",

I had a roommate who had lots of visitors all day. I was exhausted after a long labor and C-section, but couldn't nap with all that noise. Finally everyone left because her preacher came in. He started reading aloud from The Bible. I thought he'd read a few verses to comfort the new (and single--such a sinner!) mother and then leave. Ha. He read her the Begats! You know: Abraham begat Issac; Isaac begat Esau. Esau begat.... It's like nine pages of that. I felt like kicking him in the begats.\n\nTo make it all worse, they wouldn't release her until she had a name for her baby, and she kept dithering. She'd say, \"Hmm...Michael?\" and I'd say enthusiastically, \"Oo! You can't go wrong with Michael!\" And she'd say,\"Or maybe Seth...\" \"Seth! That's it! That's your winner!\" Ugh. After two days of that, she finally decided on \"Christopher.\" The silence was blissful.",

When the nurses in the CCU heard him, they called the MPs and told this idiot he has 5 seconds to leave or be escorted off the base.

It's impossible to be quiet when you're unwell, you might be coughing, snoring, choking, in pain, need a nurse/have tests done at all hours.\n\nA basic level of respect goes for everyone, but if they told you you snore first obviously the subject is fair game. They're not immune just because they were born first. \n\nIt's common sense to take earplugs and a sleep mask to hospital. The curtains are thin as hell. What do they expect people to do when they can't sleep, lie there in the dark in silence?\n\nMy Mum got stuck in a hospital room with some teenager while she had terminal cancer and he was playing video games full volume until the wee hours so she told him to shut F up. Not totally out of character for her but when you're in hospital you're scared, away from home, uncomfortable and probably bunged up as hell. Everyone is going to be on edge and not their best self. That said, you haven't done anything wrong, but equally they're allowed to mention it in case you can try to do something about it.\n\nIgnore the old biddies and get well soon. If they bring up the light again suggest they have a relative bring a mask (to shove up their arses)",

It took me 6 months to find another job.\n\nFor 6 months I had to endure this tiny brain mean person.\n\nI started  imagining her head being a huge cartoon balloon and all her meanness towards me just bounced off me and back to her. It made me laugh internally and smile externally every time she did her passive aggressive bullying. \n\nI'm pretty sure she got confused (she may have thought I was a little touched) because her behavior was reduced. Had I stayed maybe it would have stopped? Idk, but it helped me turn the bullying away from me in my head. The words and behavior couldn't hurt me, she was just a big balloon head.\n\nHope you can go home soon and get away from grumpy grams.",

You MAY want to speak with the Ward Nurse and explain that your \"roommates\" are harrassing you because you can't sleep well even though you're TRYING to be as unobtrusive as possible.  You STILL need to be able to entertain yourself when you can't sleep.  Maybe they can move you away from the old biddies! \ud83e\udd23\n\nPlease ask your doctor about Belbuca for your pain after your surgery.  It's a film that dissolves after you attach it inside your mouth cheek within about 20 minutes and it's non-addictive.  It's the ONLY medication that has helped alleviate my pain (chiropractic accident and 4 cervical spine surgeries - 16 years) and still be able to function within my disability. \n\nI'm praying that YOUR surgery is successful, your recovery is swift and that you're able to return to your hearth, home and loved ones soon! \u2764 Best wishes and many Blessings!",

My daughter had serious health issues and I was there for her.\n\nI learned things.  One of the most poignant is that if a baby is crying, that baby is healthy enough to cry.  They have strong lungs.  They are alert enough to be angry and upset.  They have a great chance of going home. \n\nI've lost track of how many codes I've heard called on children.  As a patient parent, I never learn how they resolved.  But when babies cry, I know they're doing well.  It's a beautiful sound... even if hard to sleep through.\n\nAll of this nighttime complaint is signs of life.  You're still here.  It's a good thing.  They're complaining about a good thing.",

As for the respect thing, I know exactly what you mean about the difference between politeness and respect. Politeness is a given, respect not so much.

Everytime a nurse came in the room, she was asking if they had a different room for her to move into. I could hear everything she was saying. She wasn't very nice. I had a little cough, from the pneumonia,  but not bad. Roommate wouldn't stop being rude so I purposely started fake coughing throughout the day...just to get on her nerves. Her talking bad about me upset me but I just kept coughing. They finally found her a different room. And I was happier with a room to myself.",

One was pleasantly periodically chatty, one was silent and the other was older and a bit puddled (in a harmless way). The old dear snored on and off but as I was absolutely bloody wired after the general anaesthetic (didn\u2019t sleep for 30 hours) it wasn\u2019t a problem for me. I asked a nurse to pull the curtains round, turned off my lamp and perused my iPad all night until that sweet, sweet NHS toast was served.\n\nWhen my mum first started nursing in the late 60s, the wards were one long massive room with loads of patients. She didn\u2019t half get her steps in!",

    "postText": "Not my story, but a family friend\u2019s story. I knew this lovely German lady who I will call Heidi. (Not real name.) She was married to an Israeli man who I\u2019ll call Douche. \n\nDouche was a douche for a number of reasons. He worked with my dad in IT who said he had a hero complex where he would cause disasters at work and then try to be the hero and \u201csave the day.\u201d We even suspect he caused a huge IT disaster at our national airport while he was working there. He was also really creepy, he creeped on my younger sister, calling her randomly and asking to pick her up. He was the exact opposite of his wife who was lovely and sweet and charismatic and I have no idea how they ended up together. \n\nUnfortunately, a while after we made friends with them, Heidi got very sick. Her colon stopped working, she almost died. Thankfully she was in a country with stellar healthcare who saved her life, but she found it she has Crohn\u2019s disease, and she had to get a colostomy bag. While she was recovering from her surgery, Douche announced he wanted to divorce. His words were, and I quote, \u201cI didn\u2019t marry a sick woman.\u201d Fucking prick. \n\nHe left her high and dry, and very soon was seeing someone else. He lost all the friends he had made in our country with his awful behaviour, my family told him he was no longer welcome near us as we were there for Heidi. He finally fecked off back to Israel, apparently he had got into quite a bit of debt while in my country, and skipped off to avoid paying. Good riddance we all said. \n\nHeidi found her feet eventually. She took up photography, and went to university to study it. She did very well for herself, and lived a happy life free from Douche. After about a year, Douche contacted Heidi and she told us all about it. Apparently he was trying to sweet talk her into going over to Israel to go through with the divorce proceedings. According to Heidi, your marital status is on your identity card in Israel, and it\u2019s one of the first things a girl asks to see when you go on a date. When the girls saw he was married on his card, they\u2019d never go for a second date. \n\nSo every time he\u2019d call her asking when she was coming over, she\u2019d put a huge shit eating grin on  and reply, \u201cOhhh, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not really in a position to fly with my condition and all. Maybe when I get better.\u201d She knew full well he won\u2019t set foot back here because his creditors were still looking for their money back. She would just relish in the knowledge that he was getting rejected by all those women he was pursuing in Israel while she chilled with us having a great time. \n\nHeidi is doing much better now, she went back to Germany, though still visits my family and her friends from time to time. She\u2019s still her awesome self. \n\nI don\u2019t know what Douche is up to now, but I suspect after all these years he is still a douche. ",

            "comment": "This is beautiful. Typically in Israel, due to really messed up marriage laws, the husband can refuse divorce and it becomes a whole thing where the wife is stuck in this situation where she can't remarry or even really date. It's kind of poetic that it's going the other way this time.\n\nSide note, if she wants to be even more petty, it would be a terrible shame if she told the creditors about where he lives now. Even more shameful if they file a lawsuit in Israel where the debt gets pulled immediately from his bank account.",

We were always puzzled as to why the sellers were seemingly in such a rush to sell; our first offer was for tens of thousands less than the listing price, just as an opening salvo in the negotiation, and to our shock they accepted it immediately. Everything went fine with the inspection; they even agreed to replace the furnace at their expense because it had a small crack in it. \n\nAfter moving in, we quickly became good friends with our neighbors across the street, and they filled us in on why the sellers were so eager to get rid of the house. A married couple lived there whose two kids had recently gone off to college. Everything seemed perfectly fine with them as far as anyone in the neighborhood could tell. Then, out of the blue, the wife was diagnosed with aggressive cancer (I forget which kind) and given six months to live. She only survived about half that long, which may in part have been because... the day of the diagnosis, the husband packed his shit, moved out, and stopped answering her calls. Just totally cut her off. Family, friends, and neighbors were floored; nobody expected him to be capable of that kind of thing. Our neighbors had to help care for her; my buddy across the street was over there every day doing what he could to help out, as was his wife, who fortunately works as an occupational therapist and could be helpful in that way.\n\nThe kids were utterly overwhelmed by everything, as you'd expect. A family friend worked as a realtor and agreed to help them sell the house free of charge. The kids just asked her to please get it over with as soon as possible; they didn't ever want to see the house again or have to think about the process of selling it. Family friends came in and gave everything a fresh coat of paint and cleaned the place up (it was immaculate), she got it listed as soon as she could, and she accepted the first offer that came in - ours.",

It's very possible that you realize you no longer love or even like this person anymore during their trying times, but you stay because leaving someone who's suffering from cancer is an asshole move. \n\nWhen their wife/gf has recovered though, the husband/bf finally feel as if they can leave the relationship without being a complete utter jerk - they've done their \"duty\" to stay and help their spouse through the trying times, but now that's done, they are free...\n\nIt's one thing to leave your partner the moment you find out he or she is sick, that shows a very egotistical view on the relationship and it's breaking the implicit agreement to stand by your partner even in trying times that a serious relationship entails - however, leaving after, I can't see how that makes someone an asshole, unless of course they flat out confirm that it's because she no longer has the boobs he married.

We've been to the ER at least 250 times over the last 8 years (this is not including scheduled appts).  90% of the time it's nothing (calms the nerves to confirm you're not dying) or just fluids and pain management.  She's also had 5 surgeries for PCO which caused another severe situation that pulls on the intestinal tract due to adhesions and scarring.\n\nIt does take a toll on the support system.  I've hung in there for a long time, and we do not have much of a life.  Between the debt from medical bills (even with insurance) its been a crushing situation that's caused severe depression and a need for therapy.  When I go to waiting rooms and hospitals I'm so desensitized by now that it's almost impossible to be supportive. \n\nWhile  I know I'm not this guy (the Israeli) it really makes me feel  sad because all the times I ponder if I'd still go through with it if I could go back and change it.  I do love her, but the aftermath is she's now more like a sister and family...not a wife.\n\nSo my life is not my own.  I'm a prime example of what happens when you do support someone with this type of illness.  It's pretty much a slow sacrificial step in front of a bus.\n\nI feel constantly guilty for feeling like this because she's the one going through the illness.

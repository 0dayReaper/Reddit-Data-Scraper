    "postText": "I used to live in an apartment complex where there were rows of six, 2 story high townhouse apts to each building, that were facing each other. The driveway and parking area and spaces were in the middle of them, which created a sound catching amphitheater valley which amplified all the parking lot sounds. Everyones parking spaces were in front of their front doors. There were idiots galore who played their cars music loud, or had social hour in front of their houses, and the kids all played there too. I didn\u2019t mind that too much except for when it was late at night when everyone was sleeping. Many bedroom windows faced the center of that amphitheater parking lot. Mine included.  \nOne night, across from me, but not directly across, some drunk couples were loud and sitting out there on their front porch. Someone had drove up and started arguing with the people who were sitting there, having social drunk time at 2am, disturbing everyone. A fight almost broke out.  \n\n\nThe car that came in did not belong to anyone who lived there and after the car zoomed off, the partiers were louder than ever, continuing their loud conversations. After about a half hour more of this offending ruckus, I quietly eased my window open, got my laser pointer and shone it onto one of the loud rude neighbors. One of the other people noticed the light on him and told him. They freaked out and all started crouching, ducking and covering behind the cars, scrambling to avoid the red dot being put on them. HaHaHaHa! \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23  \nThey thought the people who they had just argued with had come back and had put them in the laser site of a gun! They all ran into the apartment and off the front porch and shut their door, which had been open and playing music for only their pleasure. So rude they were. Soon after, some police cars showed up whom they must have called because they felt their lives were in danger by some unknown lurker with them in their gun lasers sight. I still laugh to this day when I think of them suddenly dropping and crouching and scrambling, running for cover and getting the hell in their apartment, where they should have been all along.",

The buildings just amplify all the noise. \n\nMy neighbor next door comes out and confronts the loud drunk people across the parking lot, which quickly escalated to screaming matches, thrown lawn chairs, and a near fist fight. \n\nMy next door neighbor went inside and came back out with a shotgun and the people across the parking lot went inside and called the police. Ten minutes later about a dozen cop cars show up, surround my neighbors door and order him out with a loudspeaker at gun point. All these cops pointing their guns at his door, meaning dozens of guns pointing at *my door too*. \n\nTurns out the shotgun was a movie prop, it went *cha-chug* but otherwise wasn't real. Dude went to jail anyway. All because he couldn't sleep due to the loud drunks, as he had work in the morning. He didn't go to work that morning.",

Its a terrible way to construct housing. I have another story about someone who every morning would drive up a few doors down at 6:45am, beep the horn and sit there for 15-20 mins waiting for the person to come out for a ride. They would be blasting their stupid music the whole time. Drove me nuts because I was still sleeping, but if I went out there in a rage, you can be sure it would never be resolved.\n\nOne morning I had one of those dollar store Air Horns that was as loud as a full sized one. I cracked my window just enough to get it aimed in his direction and let it blast, just once. It echoed twice as loud in that magnified sound tunnel.\n\nHe quickly turned his blaring music down and looked all around. He didn\u2019t know who did it. It could have been one of the big burly men who lived there who could easily turn him into pulp. No reason to let anyone know it was just little ole me! He never blasted his music every morning, after that day.  Another problem solved.",

Luckily, we only lived there for about a year or two before we bought a house. \n\nIn the same complex, there was this other couple who would constantly fight and hold screaming matches outside so everyone could hear their drama.

How much of that never makes the local news let alone the world news? Your impression from our media may be a bit skewed I think. \n\n  Some increase in freedoms come with risks, and the majority *here* feel it's a fair trade off. So, why so cowardly? (/s It's your choice. The final jab there, not serious, but is to make a point about your choice differences being just as valid as ours. Some respect for both views should be included as we are talking about a democracy... (maybe).  Mutual respect is due according to the more compromising of our sensibilities anyhow. IMO the sarcastic approach will only entrench folks here deeper against control for the most part, fwiw.  No I don't own a weapon but don't fear them either. I fear small groups of people who want to control others in ways I don't agree with, far more.",

That isn't totally false, but conversely you are institutionalized in the opposing fashion of being fearful of them to the point you don't seem to acknowledge safe handling or ownership is even possible.  \n\nThe \"safety\" and \"why\" viewpoint developed that I'm sharing should be fairly clear, members of my family have been persecuted in the past when weapons were taken away \"because they aren't needed\"  \n\n I don't have Euro travel experience but have been keen on the idea for decades. And I do have a couple English friends who I've bounced that off of and they agree with the stabby bit too. And there was hanging with a small group of visiting Aussie's for a summer that couldn't believe how tame and regulated it is here. Their media perception shot to hell.\n\n  The \"child\" ages of that info stretch into adulthood too. I didn't read far because I don't even consider an average 16yr old a \"child\", let alone 2 years into legal adulthood here.  I left home for the first time at 15yrs. Again at 16 (still in grade school and finished and continued). By 19 I had started a legit business. Lots more to throw in too, but it's too virture-ish.\n\n If there is a more specific breakdown of the numbers I'd be interested in seeing it. But news and studies are often too skewed for me to accept some numbers *easily* over the general perception of people's first hand experiences, namely the foreigners, who I've known and spoken with many times for over a decade.   Good ol' stoicly objective journalism died a long long time ago. \n\n  I also have a sibling that schooled in England France and Spain. That's who I originally picked up on \"stabby\" from.  As well as pub fights where the opponents go have a beer after someone stops getting up. We don't \"play\" often when it comes to fists is my take. Fun fact, I've watched three people die with one punch.. still saw nobody shot. I know two people who have been, one random mistakenly for a thief the other a cop who pulled over a lunatic who was ready willing and asking to back to jail.\n\n  Even negative views from visitors mostly consist of big city visits and some driving across the country to tourist traps. Expected but, highway views are not a good representation any more than the world news is. And there are also tons of remote regions where folks haven't locked a door in decades, if ever. \n  \n Finally, the stats are 2020(?) ... the most turbulent year in the US in 30 yrs politically, involving more young adults than anything experinced previously, not to mention the pandemic impact on normal life too. I could be wrong but it seemed your lock-downs were much more enforced than here. I think we had way more upset people roaming free without a job to go to, school, etc.. of course the numbers went way up, and of course the numbers included are skewed to write a headline; that's what the world does now. (another old job. Top of my classes, but I quit newsprint and ads because of the scum factor I saw after a few years. Journalistic integrity was dying fast *then* and certainly hasn't rebounded enough to trust blindly; but a better data breakdown would still interest me. Thank you for that initial effort regardless)",

I'm not sure it reflects what you wanted to say.  Basically you actually say the gun *regulation* causes more violence. I don't think you meant it to read that way. It might not be your mistake either, goofley droid spellwreck is garbage with a leak in the can they can't fix. \n\n  Also back to the topic: The author of the link says there is no reason to assume numbers would drop; but curiously also doesn't mention the same fact to be true about not assuming an increase. It overall doesn't state an anti gun view directly but the big picture definitely leaned that way imo vs balanced point and counterpoints of a stoicly objective report from an unbiased professional. \n\n  If there had only been rises over the last 20yrs, they would have a halfway decent point with no real need for mention of the    latter.\n\n But that isn't the case looking at the graph also supplied by them. \n  The numbers have dropped pretty significantly since the late 90s. I would love to see the 80s and 90s added to this to create an accurate picture that is a bit more long term. I'm thinking it has dropped since then too. \n\n Either way, the graph shows differences to the text, and the text shows signs of bias by omission of a devils advocate counterpoint where convenient for the argument they seem lean towards. It is incomplete at best, bias is there at the worst... I'm supposed to accept *that* as factual and unbiased?",

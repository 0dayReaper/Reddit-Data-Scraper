    "postText": "It started with extremely spotty wifi and dumb as rocks Twitter based support.  My dad the account holder had just dropped a couple hundred on a new gateway and router. But the issue of unreliable wifi continued. After months of Twitter support telling me to flood the gateway with restarts like a car engine. I decided, f-ck it I\u2019m irritated and you\u2019re going to get it.\n\nFor reference their Twitter support aren\u2019t even certified techs as they claim. They can only direct you to the site and to do basic stuff off Google. Then tell you a bunch of misleading stuff to try and get you to make a tech appointment. So I spent the day not logging in, giving them the address and account holder name. And forcing them to stay on in my dms if they refused a simple request too much. I asked for the manager, when the clearly not manager talked down to me. I contacted the FCC a day later with screen shots showing the misleads and the bs. The escalations team reached out, I told them to F-ck off and that I know they\u2019re only doing it because of my complaint. It forced them to do what I knew they could and would\u2019ve been easy. Had they not tried to stonewall me in the first place which is look it up and contact the account holder. They picked the wrong stubborn b*tch to mess with. \n\n\nI started bugging them around 8am to 10pm. It all could\u2019ve been avoided had they not tried to see if they could outlast my bullheadedness.\n\nWhen they did try to get my dad to add me to the account so they could try and get me to play their money wasting game. My dad who\u2019s even more bullheaded went off on them and told them off. \n\nAnd that\u2019s why C@mc@$t will no longer answer my dms on twitter.\n\nAll I had was a simple request, I would like to report an outage. Ok no, then manager. Their escalations team response proves they didn\u2019t need me to log into the account. To diagnose issues so I knew all the attempts. Were likely from a random group of volunteers. Who were told direct them to the website. Say whatever you need to, to get them to sign into the website.\n\nPs. Now I randomly tweet at someone who\u2019s tweeted at them. And direct them to also contact the FCC if they don\u2019t want to continue with the run around. And I\u2019ll continue to do so until I\u2019m probably going to get blocked.\n\n\nUpdate: persuaded someone to also contact the FCC on c%mc@st.\n\n\nUpdate part 2: they finally got the line buried that should\u2019ve been buried years ago. But someone decided to make it a jank job trying to do it behind our backs. And run it under the sidewalk and not tell anyone so we would continue to have issues. Another shady tactic that c@mc@st tried to get away with. That thankfully the pros fixed. We don\u2019t know why they sent out someone to try a janky method. But we\u2019re glad the pros didn\u2019t just decide to let it be and did their jobs. \n\nIf I had to guess the Hope was the pros would either say well enough. Or it was a ploy to try and get us to be held liable for this. Either way it\u2019s underhanded and shady asf.",

That was surprisingly fast and effective for us when traveling. Just booted up the laptops and put them on the phone's hotspot. If you have crap connections for all cell phone companies in your area it's not going to work, but if one of the companies is decent, this may be an option.",

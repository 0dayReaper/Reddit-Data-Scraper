In the next one, I've given a paedophile character the name of someone who gave me a crap review on Amazon. They probably won't find out, but if they do, let's see if they find that 'lazy and formulaic'.\"",

So King ended up inserting his own actual real-world self into one of his novels in order to recount the incident, making sure to spend several pages illustrating just how much of an buffoon the van driver was. To be fair, that's fairly mild revenge given what he went though.\n\nHe also more recently wrote a tale whose villain was a very thinly disguised Rupert Murdoch. King described his publically known moral failings and then added a bunch of others, including raping an 8 year old girl \"to see what it felt like\". The hero of the story killed him of course.",

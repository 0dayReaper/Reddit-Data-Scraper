    "postText": "I used to work in an office with \"Gary,\" who was the absolute worst. He hated that I was female and ten years younger but was technically his superior, and took every chance he got to avoid having to do things for me. He dragged his feet on anything I gave him, and if I asked for something by a certain day or time he would complain to his boss, since he essentially saw us as peers. Eventually I stopped giving him anything but the work I absolutely couldn't do myself, but he still hemmed and hawed about it until someone higher in the food chain reiterated that yes, he did in fact need to assist me with whatever totally-appropriate request I had just made. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur office had one of those gigantic standalone printers, but I was the only one who thought to look up the manual online and understand it. So every time Gary and I were each printing something, I would knock his print job down in the queue. I once overheard Gary explaining to our department head Bill that he couldn't do anything because the printer was down, so I quickly reset it. When Gary and Bill looked at it again, I heard Bill say in an annoyed tone \"Well, it looks fine now,\" and ask Gary to hurry things up. Every chance I got I stuck his print jobs in the back of the queue, and at one point when he bemoaned the fact that he was always dead last, I shrugged and suggested that he get to the office earlier, so he actually started coming in at 7:30am for a brief period of time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe most memorable thing I did was to switch Gary's print job to tray four (which was considered the \"crappy\" tray, since it was slightly out of alignment and tended to crease the paper), and he accidentally printed what looked like an entire ream of (creased) hot pink literature for a board meeting, because the last person using that tray had been printing breast cancer awareness fliers.",

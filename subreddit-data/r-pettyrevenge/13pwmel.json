    "postText": "Some years ago I was working at a company and made the mistake of becoming a SME. This meant that people would come to me with all kinds of questions. That included a particular engineer who one day decided she was going to hide behind a blind corner when she saw me walking down the hall to leave for the day. She pops out at the last second and then starts asking me questions about one of her projects. \n\nSome time passes and the company is holding some kind of all-hands meeting and for reasons unknown is offering Jamba Juice smoothies in the lobby to one of the conference rooms. By dumb luck I run into that same engineer who takes two smoothies, despite there being a sign saying one per person -- one was for her fianc\u00e9. \n\nOn the way back to my desk, in another building, inspiration strikes. As soon as I get back, I find an MS Word template for an old west wanted poster, slap a photo of the engineer from her Facebook page on it, and then give her the criminal name, ${First\\_Name} \"Smoothie\" ${Last\\_Name} and at the bottom say that she is wanted for stealing smoothies. I pass a copy around to some people who have worked with that engineer in the past and know her fairly well, and then convinced one of the other engineers to print it out and tape it to her office door when she had left early for an appointment.  \n\nAfter that, until I left that job, everyone made appointments with me if they had questions.",

But damn, now I wish I would have thought of that smooth criminal song at the time. I probably could have worked that in somehow. Oh well. Maybe a future opportunity will arise one day. I'll keep that in my back pocket, so to speak.",

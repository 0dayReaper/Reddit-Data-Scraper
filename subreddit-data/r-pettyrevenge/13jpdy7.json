    "postText": "I use a garage parking facility daily to go into the office. We have limited spots available on certain floors in the garage (unassigned). Now I'm not someone that has road rage or anything - cut me off? No problem, suspect you're in a rush. Little old person driving 20 below the speed limit? No sweat, we ain't goin nowhere fast. ..but when space is already limited in tight stalls as it is and your back tire is over the line or you have fully DPd 2 stalls. Well! Bend over. Cancel my meetings. I'm here to do you dirty! \n\nPG approach: For example, if your only being a cunt making it nearly impossible for the average person to use the next stall, I have no problem squeezing in (assuming your drivers side is towards me). And by squeezing in, I mean leaving a 2 finger gap between our cars. See, my car is a piece of shit, bunch of dents, scratches, whatever. And I will fully lay the seat down and crawl out the back if need be to box you.\n\nRating 14+: But if you double parked. Well I have a special gift for you..  Important to note here is that it's stanking hot, all the time. Just so happens I carry duct tape in my car. An old melty gummy roll of duct tape. And in these moments of fury, I reach for the duct tape, cut a long thin strip and peel back the weatherstripping against the drivers side window of your car. Using a pencil I poke in the duct tape and press it into the window. It's not something you'd notice when you get in immediately. Only when you go to roll up and down the window. Even when you finally peel off the duct tape, the hot gummy sticky adhesive will have gotten stuck to the weather stripping too. So every time you roll down your window and roll it back up, a sticky snail trail will be there, haunting you for being a double park dick.\n\n-pettyagro\n\n*Edit: spelling, formatting etc.",

I don't think it means what you think it means.\n\nDouble parking refers to street parking, where you park next to a car that is already parked on the side of the road.  You could *maybe* stretch it to mean parked parallel behind cars that are parked in normal perpendicular parking spaces.  Either way, it refers to you parking your car in a way that blocks another car into their parking spot.  \n\nHere's the wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_parking",

Or we sent the smallest kid to the back hatch and we exited there. I kept post it notes and sharpies on hand to leave a note thanking them for saving me a most exceptional spot close to the front with all my kids. \n\nI now drive a Suburban and will still occasionally do this. I always back into parking spots though so I can get further into the parking space. It allows shorter cars next to me the ability to see a little bit more of the travel space when they are exiting their spot.",

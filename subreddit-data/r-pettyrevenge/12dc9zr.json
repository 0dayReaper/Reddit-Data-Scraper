    "postText": "My neighbors have a teenage son whose friends keep parking in my driveway. I went to check my mail last week and saw them all out front and decided to nicely bring it up which was met with eye rolls and fake \"okays\".\n\n Monday comes around and I come home to find 3 of his friends cars taking all the space I have to park. It was a 14 hour day for me so I wasn't having it and made my second approach with intention to make myself very clear and said I'd make it the neighbors sons problem. \n\nTonight I get home and it's happened again. I went next door and an adult finally answered! I brought up the cars at my place and added a side note their kid never expected! He's also been throwing his disposable vapes in my yard and I have the other neighbor as a witness! So I casually asked them to make sure that stops and the instant change in expression told me everything I needed to know after I walked away. Shortly after his friends left and I can assume they probably won't be back for a while.\n\nHappy spring break kid.",

Maybe he does usually, but to be disrespectful and have his friends he just as disrespectful would probably lead to arrests. \n\nPlus he\u2019s littering and thought you wouldn\u2019t find out or turn him in. Hopefully he learns a valuable lesson about respect.",

For me to took a brush with the law to realize that a nice warm home with dinner ready was a better alternative than to run around with other kids breaking the law for fun. I managed to get to a somewhat normal place while a lot of the people I hung around ended up with kids way too early, more serious encounters with the law, or dead.",

It dawned on me that several of them didn\u2019t have the same kind of home situation that I did. Despite my situation being far from perfect, it was better than theirs and it was an early experience of feeling real guilt for me. I think for this reason why I support after school programs and safe places for kids to be productive and stay out of trouble. It\u2019s far to easy to end up on the wrong path when you\u2019re a bored kid with nothing to do.",

There were times my mom had to tell dad to wear more clothing in the morning because we had a guest. Unexpected, but welcome. And once we had 2 moms show up to make sure that everything was copacetic. They were surprised to find that both of my parents were home, there was no alcohol being consumed, and the kids (teenagers) were watching a movie. They were wanting to finish up, then head home. After that, word spread to the other parents, and all parties were at our house. I was younger, and occasionally went to grandma's house. I was stopped by my sister's best friend, 16m, who begged me to let them watch the movie I was going to take with me. I heard that they stopped and rewound the movie 28 times for kiss the girl, and 21 times for under the sea. Yes, crazy times. But like I said, it was a safe haven. We had mountain dew, playing board games, Legos.",

My dad worked all the time but was very attentive when he was home. So, I ended up mirroring my social group because there was often nobody there when I needed someone to be there.",

They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.\n\nQuote by Socrates\n\nThe whole 'kids these days' thing goes back several thousands of years.

It gets to be over 100\u00b0 here in the summer. I talked to one of them, it was a teenager and I said the dog shouldn't be outside without shade or water because it could die. And the kid said that I'm stupid because dogs are not people and you don't need to treat dogs like people. So I called animal control on them and it turns out they weren't even supposed to have a dog because that was part of the rental agreement. So they lost their dog and in revenge they decided to spray paint my dad's fence. However in that town they get your ID every time you buy a can of spray paint so the cops were able to track the spray paint color to the purchaser and it was the next door neighbors what a surprise.",

The problem is many of them stop at \"on private property\" and use that as justification to not do anything unless it's a major issue.\n\nThe \"without permission of the property owner\" is why stop signs in parking lots are mostly unenforceable and most hoas don't have police patrolling them when people speed through them.\n\nThe owners could set up agreements to allow the police to enforce laws in those areas, but most don't.

One of my preschoolers dad was the chief of police at the time and at 5 am, I had to send out a message that we had to close and explained what happened. Chief showed up at 7, after texting me immediately to not touch anything until he got there and to get pics of all the damages. I handed over the security footage and those kids did actually spend time in juvie over it and were put on probation as well. Due to the exact damage at our home, they were linked to multiple other homes. Altogether they did over 200k in personal and property damages and got screwed and i could not have been happier.",

Self entitled brats were not respected and those who pushed it eventually got the crap kicked out of them by other teens. \n\nIf a neighbour swatted your kid the average parents would simply ask why as opposed to immediately defend the kid. Nobody called the cops because the cops would also ask why. \n\nThe \"it takes a village to raise a child\" mentality is not just about support &amp; protection. It's also about discipline &amp; not allowing the child to get away with everything, getting spoiled or behaving like a jerk.",

They just abandon their car just past the culvert making it impossible to pass around them. I had a really long unpaved driveway with plenty of space to park on. I ended up parking long ways across the driveway, just enough I'm out of traffic and went inside to take a nap after work. They are careless, so am I.\n\nThe idiot parker later had to drive out the second unpaved driveway that has no culvert where you have to go through the ditch to get out. Easy for trucks, not so great for cars. It's really rough in the wet season. Cars always scrape noisily on the pavement trying to get up the ditch for those that don't know how to drive across such high angle egress.",

They are rediculous and immature at times, but they are also adorable loveable kids just trying to figure out how to navigate their world.  They are very respectful to the parents and adults around their parents, and I really appreciate that.  I also would appreciate another adult coming to me if I need to check my son for being dangerous, disrespectful,  or otherwise disruptive in a menacing way.  Glad OP finally got to talk to the adult neighbors, hope it helps and the teens don't turn to maliciousness toward OP.  I think I would invest in some cameras at this point.",

    "postText": "*edit* receipt upload https://imgur.com/a/JJgrhuA\n(Update thanks to whoever reviewed the actual location also it\u2019s amazing the amount of people with similar experiences at total wine) \n\nI got mad all over again writing this because of the sheer amount of disrespect from total wine management. I have the receipt for this order too. \n\nThere\u2019s a specific wine I use to pair with food the closest total wine that had it was a 60 mile drive and it was storming out and I wanted it for the holidays because most likely was going to be cooped up inside.\n\nSo I drive over, this used to be my typical total wine until I moved 2 counties away. \n\nAnyways I go in and pickup the wine and get some other stuff for holiday parties was in there maybe an hour and it comes time to check out and the cashier asks me for my iD so I give it to her and then she tells me she needs to see the iD of the other person I was with so now I\u2019m confused and say I\u2019m alone? And she says well I have to go get my manager. Ok fine? \n\nSo he comes out to tell me that she told him I was with someone and they need to come back and bring their iD or they won\u2019t sell it to me. \n\nI told him I wasn\u2019t with anyone. He asks to see my iD looks at it and says \u201cwell unfortunately you look young\u201d\n\nAt this point I\u2019m like are you serious??? And he\u2019s like \u201cyou can come back tomorrow ALONE\u201d \n\nI find it extremely disrespectful to tell someone they look young while you\u2019re holding their iD in your hand and not to mention I\u2019ve been shopping at that exact location for about 4 years and have never had a problem \n\nSo I told him about how I drove there and have been shopping there for years and that I even have a second form of iD and he was just kind of giggling and saying no.\n\nSo I left very angry and it was late around 9 pm and then I had the about hour and a half drive back home in the rain storm.\n\nSo I was home pissed about it all night and the next day I went in to the one close to my house to get the other stuff I was getting unfortunately that one was out of the wine that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t originally go there.\n\nThey were pleasant as usual actually beyond nice and didn\u2019t even iD me which just goes to show the other location was on some kind of power trip or something. \n\n\nThen I got an email from them to review my experience. Which they send every time I go there and I never do it but I decided to select the location I had the bad experience at and give feed back on it.\n\nSo I wrote exactly what happened and then the next day I got a call from the store manager. Turns out the guy that night was an assistant manager or something. However he was much more pleasant than the woman that called me. She was extremely rude and condescending and told me that she reviewed the cameras and that someone walked in with me at the same time and that made us a party. I told her I didn\u2019t know them. She said it didn\u2019t matter. so apparently people can\u2019t walk in to total wine at the same time as you???\n\nThen she said that the employees were watching me and that the person left 30 minutes before I went to check out and they saw it.\n\nOk so? Also if that is the case and that is your policy, why didn\u2019t you say something when you saw the person leave and we could have cleared up the whole situation right then and there. Instead of continuing to allow me to shop for another 30 minutes and waste my time to know that when I came to check out you were going to deny it? \n\nSo I told her even if that is the case someone can\u2019t leave a store??? And she said \u201cno. To complete the transaction they would have to drive back with their iD\u201d \n\nThis made me extremely angry because even if that is the case and that is your policy at least you can offer an apology for the inconvenience or something like that. Not just call me to argue and stir the pot. I was already kind of over it because it had been like 2 days but just her whole attitude and nastiness about the whole thing was really insult to injury. \n\nSo I decided to look up their policy and their policy clearly states that this only applies to parties at checkout so the rule is who is with you at checkout which that makes sense or is at least more understandable. \n\nAnother policy I read which was interesting was that any online order not picked up within a week they will issue a full refund to your original payment method.\n\n\nSo my friends and I were sitting home drinking the stuff I had got at the other location later that day and telling them what happened and they were all shocked. \n\n\nI used to work retail for a long time specifically during covid and I know what an inconvenience it is to setup big curbside pickup orders because they take up a lot of space on the order shelf. \n\nSo drunk and mad I decided to enforce their own policy on them and make a $10,000 order for the soonest possible pickup time which they promise orders ready in 3 hours.\n\nSo I made sure to order the cheapest heaviest bottles I could think of so it can take up the most amount of space in their curbside are and made sure to only order like 1 or 2 of each so they couldn\u2019t just give me a case they had to get individual ones and I ordered their whole supply of Tito\u2019s since it\u2019s popular and it\u2019s the holidays and I know people are going to be looking for it and this total wine has its curbside order section in the front behind a counter where you can see it \n\nAnd I know when customers saw it they would ask for it and then they would have to explain how someone ordered all 238 bottles and they\u2019re back there on reserve. Then they\u2019d probably get grouchy and ask for a manager.\n\nBut the manager would be busy because I also made sure to order a lot of bottles behind glass so they would have to run around with their keys scrambling to get this order ready. I worked retail and I know how much stuff like this throws off a schedule and annoys the managers. \n\nSo I loaded up the cart and stopped when I got bored and placed the order. I got the email confirmation which specified that you have to wait for the pickup confirmation email and that pickup times aren\u2019t guaranteed so I thought for sure they were either going to cancel the order or call me or something.\n\nAnd something interesting that is sent with the email is a pickup policy that states specifically \u201cthe recipient of the order needs to be 21\u201d so you can have other people in your car not 21??? \n\nWell 5 hours later I got the pickup email. It took them longer but I was still surprised.\n\nThen later I got a pickup reminder email. Then 3 days later a second reminder. Then 7 days I got my \u201cfinal notice\u201d email\n\nAnd then day 10 I got a phone call. It was the manager acting like a completely different person this time asking when I was coming for the order. At this point I think she knew I was fucking with them because it had been 10 days and she knew my name from the previous feedback thing because when she called she asked for me by name and my name was on the order \n\nSo I told her \u201cyeah I went to pick it up and was told I look too young, so I just went to the other total wine and picked it up the same stuff there\u201d \n\nSo then she was mad and said \u201care you seriously not coming to pick this up?\u201d Lollll restockkkkkkk \n\nI just said \u201cnahhh\u201d\n\nShe hung up lmfaooooo\n\n\nWhen your higher up asked you why your store had to refund someone $10,000 explain to them what you did  lmfaooo.\n\nThey were supposed to automatically cancel the order at the 7 day mark but didn\u2019t she called me at the 10 day. \n\nSo I called their customer service line to cancel it and she told me some stores wait to the end of the month to do it. \n\nI\u2019m assuming the manger was trying to hold out on refunding to end the year on a better number. Retail does that.\n\nI made them cancel it right then lmfaooo",

A friend had just left the checkout line with a shopping cart full for a 4th of July party, management grabbed his cart before he could leave and yelled that he needed to pay, he told them he did pay and if they didn't let him leave he was going to return the whole cart, and no he wouldn't show them the receipt like they asked.\n\nHad they asked nicely for a receipt, he would've showed them. But the violently grabbing the Cart was enough for him. He returned the whole cart while the manager tried to apologize and talk him out of it.",

No dude, I\u2019m just trying to grab some fucking cranberry juice. He kind of paused for a second and let me go.

They eventually approached me to ask if I was finding everything okay and said it was unusual for someone to be buying so much. Everything I had fit in a single basket. It ended up only being like $500 worth of stuff? \n\nIt was bizarre.",

I say no and they sorta half walk away and start straightening stock an isle or two away and moving as I do always staying within a clear line of sight\n\nEventually just stopped going their all together and had someone else at my job take over the supply shopping. It is super off-putting when you're just trying to shop but the employees are obviously monitoring you constantly like you walked in specifically to steal from them just because you wanted to look around for a few minutes",

An employee walked up to ask if we needed help, and my friend just blurts out, \"Well my dad just killed himself so we're just getting some whisky.\"\n\nThat poor employee, lol. Eyes as big as dinner plates. We laugh about it now but oof, I felt bad for a couple days after for not pulling that guy aside and apologizing and telling him he's cool and did nothing wrong.\n\nWe ended up getting some Gentleman Jack. I think I still have the empty bottle, actually, since it's got a (now) funny story attached to it.",

Worst part was her daughter was there listening to her mother go on and on about turd spoon. \n\nOr the time I had a lady come to the drop off window with wet hands and asked if this little pebble the size of a rice grain was a kidney stone. Or when people with scabies would sit on the chairs by the pharmacy and rub themselves all over the chairs to relieve their itching. \n\nPharmacy is wild.",

We were leaving work together one day and the guy at self checkout wouldn't put the sale through because I didn't have my ID on me. I said, this is my son. Here's my employee discount card and my credit card, see the (very very unusual) last name? Here's his ID - he's 27. Guy flat out refused to sell it to me. Our policy is that if the purchaser looks under 40, insist on ID or refuse the sale. I'm about to turn 50 so thanks, I guess? Got my 30ish coworker to buy it for me. The checkout dude fastwaddled over to the other set of self checkouts where my friend was to try to stop them from allowing it after seeing me hand it to my coworker and seeing the coworker head over there, but waddlebutt was too slow. Like, call AP. They can pull my employee file and tell you. No laws were broken today.",

Cops showed up, I gave him the receipt and showed him my bag, he went in and talked to LP who claimed \"oh no officer we only asked to see his receipt and in no way impeded his movement, or accused him of anything\" so I told the cop that was a bald faced lie, he shrugged his shoulders and said \"I'll write up a report, that way you can use it for a demand letter\" then a week later I get a call from the manager saying \"oh that doesn't sound like _____ we never train LP to that\" then got really quiet when I just gave her my lawyers phone number and let her know they'll be getting a call.\n\nfuck Walmart",

    "postText": "Every year at our high school, the Video Productions class will put together an entire video, called the Senior Video, of the current senior class and their best moments from now all the way back to elementary, along with a few student and teacher interviews to stop the thing from turning into a massive slide show.\n\nThis thing is supposed to be thirty minutes long, and the Video Productions class is supposed to take the entire school year to make it. Due to some unfortunate teacher-switching and lazy students, it wasn't done. So I was called upon, with less than a month until swingout, to finish from an empty timeline and no student pictures or videos.\n\nLet's meet our villain. Let's call him Andrew. Andrew is one of those people who try and actively make your life a living hell for no other reason than it being funny.\n\nHe would point me out of a crowd and call me short. Imagine: \"Hey, see that guy over there? He's a senior, and he's as tall as a freshman!\" Which- to be fair, I was the fourth shortest senior out of our graduating class, and I did find it funny when my friends made jokes about my height... but Andrew was *malicious.* He would joke with his entire friend group about my height, call me a dwarf, ect...\n\nOne thing he would do was try and make me angry. And then, he would ask *why* I was angry, and gaslight me into thinking I was overreacting. \n\nA specific example that comes to mind is when I called a rubber band a '*drive shaft*' off-handedly because I was describing to my friend how my project car would move forwards by winding a rubber band. Andrew overheard me, and actively bitched me out, telling me that I was wrong and stupid for ten minutes straight. Imagine if I was looking down at my desk, working on a worksheet, and Andrew was in the seat next to me leaning over and criticizing my incorrect use of the word Rubber Band. \n\nOf course, when I finally got angry, \"Can you leave me alone, dude?\" He then proceeded to say, \"All I was doing was pointing out your mistake? Why are you over-reacting?\" Andrew would also go to his friends and tell them all about how I have a short fuse, (hahah) and was overreacting.\n\nRemember the Senior Video?\n\nThe teacher (who knew nothing about editing, don't even know why she was the teacher) wanted to put in a slideshow at the very end of every single senior, along with their names. Pain in the ass to do, but okay. Oh, wait. I'm the only editor on this project. I see Andrew's name, along with his senior photo. What would happen if I...\n\n*Did a little trolling?*\n\nI delete his name, along with his senior photo, from the entire school's senior repository. Not from like- the system so he doesn't graduate or anything. From a folder that the yearbook classes use. No more Andrew for the senior video, yearbook, wall-banners, ect... Of course, all of those things minus the senior video were already printed, so it wasn't actually *that* bad, but... now I had plausible deniability. I didn't put Andrew's name in the video, because I didn't see him in the repository!\n\nSenior video gets exported, (albeit ten minutes shorter than it's supposed to be,) everybody watches it during swingout, and Andrew is left confused. He had to watch all of his friends and classmates scroll by the screen without him. He comes up to me afterwards and asks: \"Hey? Why wasn't I in the senior video?\"\n\n\"Sorry, man. I didn't see you in the list.\" I think he knew something was up. But I'm graduated now, so... sucks to suck, man. Plus, it's such a small thing that I removed him from that nobody would really care. It's just *petty.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Bully is a bully, I delete his name from the school's master repository, and he isn't featured in the senior video.",

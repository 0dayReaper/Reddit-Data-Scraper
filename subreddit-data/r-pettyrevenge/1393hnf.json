    "postText": "This happened last year. Applied for a clerical job and surprisingly got hired despite having no qualifications in said position nor field of work, however I've some experience in clerical work from previous job. They said they urgently needed someone to fill a supervising role of sorts for a big job coming up, but really I'm just a glorified clerk.\n\nShould've noticed the red flags tbh. First day in, empty offices. I was the only one there. Big Man comes in and showed me the pathetic excuse of an office, it was more a space to store equipment and products with some cubicles. Who am I to judge, the pandemic hit all of us hard. Job was very laid back. Draft up some quotes, fill out this or that form, accompany Big Man to sites, write a report and that's it.\n\nLet me introduce Big Man. He's rotund and not a in lovable way, crass, and generally POS manchild. The kind of POS that changes lanes without using turn signals and spewing profanities at people when honked at. Well-mannered in front of clients but berates you in the office. The wouldn't think twice to throw you under the bus types.\n\nHe's also Big Man in name only. You'd expect him to at least know wtf he's doing. Sometimes I don't know if he knows wtf he wants. A quote can have up to 30 revisions simply because he didn't liked a certain sentence being put together, or to add another zero at the end, or how about we take out that zero. You know what, add that zero back in. On the phone. \"Type it as I say it.\" Berates me for adding that zero because he forgot he requested it yesterday, and somehow it's still my fault when I'm slow with submitting the docs when he's too stupid to make up his goddamn mind. Sure.\n\nClearly he's lashing out on something unrelated to work and is just finding an excuse to have a punching bag. When he tore me a new one because I \"didn't take notes\", I started recording voice notes whenever he was in the office or when taking his calls. Mainly because he could be saying one thing at 9am, and then be saying another thing by 4pm. So at least I had evidence of his stupidity the next time he decides to verbally assault me. And he did not dissappoint.\n\n2 weeks into the sixth month I worked, he came in and hands me my notice. He assured me that he'll be paying the two weeks that I've worked and I'll be getting my money by the end of the week. End of week went by and I've yet to get my pay. I asked him about it and his response just rubs me the wrong way.\n\n\"I told you I'll pay and I will. You'll get your damn money in due time.\"\n\nI changed his name to Pig in my contacts because if he looks like one and acts like one, then he is. I'm pissed because before I left I know for a fact that a client just paid him for the previous job and he went and took his family out to dinner and a vacation, and couldn't be bothered to pay my 2 weeks. This is where I fucked up. I changed his contact name but didn't realize I haven't logged out of Whatsapp on the company laptop.\n\nA month went by and I contemplated going to the labour office for a formal complaint and according to the labour laws here it is actionable if salary isn't cleared within a month. But decided I should ask one more time. He replied back with a video showing that I called him a pig and saying how ungrateful I was that he graciously offered me a job, putting food on my table etc. Now in my culture, profanity is a serious offense and it certainly didn't helped my case asking for money. But I simply replied back to him with a voice note of him calling me shitstain.\n\nGot my pay by the end of the week.",

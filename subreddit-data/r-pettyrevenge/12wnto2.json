They are there every Sunday. \n\nToday I had enough. I parked as close as I could by their stupid protest and kept on my car alarm. I went in and gave the pharmacy money I didn't need to spend. They left on about 20 or 15 minutes later and I collected their \"pro life\" sign illegally posted on an easement. I know I shouldn't have flipped them off. I know this was petty and in poor taste but it helped me feel a bit better about not putting up with bull shit and I can't do this at the court house. I'm fed up.",

                    "comment": "Hi. Ob/gyn here. You are correct and I'm not arguing with you but rather adding to it since sex ed sucks in America at least.\n\nPlan B is simply a progesterone pill. Progesterone is one of the \"pregnancy\" hormones. In fact, its name literally tells you what it does. Even if you don't understand Latin for the actual root words, it's the PROmotion of GESTation hormONE, i.e., the hormone that tells your body you're pregnant and to hold on to the pregnancy. (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, or HCG for short, is the one that may make you nauseous. Progesterone may make you constipated, but that's a lesson for a different post.)\n\nOn a very basic level, Plan B works as emergency contraception because if your body detects progesterone is already present, then you don't need to be ovulating trying to conceive since you may already have. This means that if you take Plan B after unprotected intercourse and your body hasn't already sent the ovulation signal or outright ovulated, then the signal may be delayed long enough for the sperm present to die before ovulation occurs, so the sperm and egg never meet and conception doesn't occur. As such, even if you believe life begins at conception, fine, but conception never occurred here. Further, if ovulation has already happened and/or conception has already occurred, Plan B is simply progesterone, which the body is already making after ovulation and/or during pregnancy. *It's not impacting it in any way*, but if any argument was going to be made on how Plan B could impact a pregnancy, it would ironically be to sustain it, not terminate it.\n\nAgain, not arguing with you but rather I try to clarify this when I see posts about Plan B because of how woefully poor understanding of reproduction is by the general public (and why lawmakers passing laws with garbage medical knowledge is so infuriating).",

The roe v wade ruling understood this, which is that fundamentally all arguments against  1st trimester abortion are religious in nature because of their belief about when human life begins. They declare it is at the moment of cellular conception , that that instant is the creation of human life . \n\nIt is not.  It's the creation of the possibility of human life.  \n\nThe thing,  and the possibility of the thing,  are not the same thing.  \n\nInstead, the human life has always been understood by the ancients to begin at first breath.  This is also the position made clear in the Old Testament, the Torah of the Jews. \n\nSo who has worked to subvert this original view in order to repress the freedom of women? The Catholic Church, of course. Actively working against the freedom of women to be independent and hold social power since the transformation of the Roman Empire under Constantine. They began to ally with the Evangelicals in the US after the Civil rights era, aligning themselves with the groups who had lost the argument about school segregation; and teaching them how to use abortion as a wedge issue to splinter the electorate between the righteous and the \"baby-murderers\", essentially a subtle political battle between the old patriarchal leadership and the increasingly female dominated progressives. This is the subtext behind both the decades of slander against H.Clinton, and Pelosi , and more recently AOC, as well as the hatred for Obama which the right wing whipped into the frenzy that got Trump somehow elected (with Russia's extra helping boost with propaganda to sway neutral voters against H.Clinton).\n\ntldr\n\nfeecccckkk",

The court's ruling acknowledges that that \"belief\" is counterfactual (as you've wonderfully laid out), but hey, hobby lobby believes it, whatcha gonna do.\n\nNever mind the absurdity of a company believing anything (specifically allowed because hobby lobby was controlled by one family), it's baffling that you can weasel your way out of a legal obligation based on nothing but the everyone-agrees-is-BS belief that that obligation has a perfectly legal, but personally objectionable consequence. Imagine I went and claimed that I believe paying taxes  subsidizes red apples over green apples, which is odious to me, and a court gave me the right to not pay taxes over that.",

Pro-Lifers were already targeting various forms of contraception like IUDs before Roe vs Wade was overturned trying to get around the 'undue burden' and 'ban' clauses. \n\nhttps://www.alternet.org/2022/07/griswold-stands-states-ban-contraception\n\n&gt; \u201c**The bottom line is there is only one time something definitively happens and that\u2019s the moment of conception**,\u201d Missouri state Sen. Paul Wieland said at the time, expressing a typically sperm-centric view of the situation, \u201cOnce that happens, anything that happens should not be state funded.\u201d\n\nBy that definition, most contraception are abortions. So they must be banned.\n\nOverturning Roe v Wade didn't just trigger abortion bans but weakened many other rights inferred from that case. This includes Griswold v. Connecticut if you follow the same line of logic the fuck heads in the Supreme Court did. \n\nAny accredited medical doctor can tell you that's not how any contraceptive works, but [it doesn't matter if they are staring down lawsuits, harassment and threats of violence](https://www.justice.gov/crt/recent-cases-violence-against-reproductive-health-care-providers). \n\nContraceptives are on the chopping block because the Christan Pro-Lifers want women to only have sex within the framework of a Christian marriage and to only perform the role required in a Christian marriage. Every deviation from that is going to be under attack.",

It is not the governments place to legislate 'morality' and it makes me want to fucking puke what's going on these days.  And all my senators and congresscritters know that because I have a group email of all of them and I bitch about that etc at least twice a week.  Is it going to do anything?  Nope. But I'm damn sure voting against all of them in every election.  I used to be conservative and still am but the GOP has gone too fucking far against basic human rights.  Until they get rid of the toothless hillybilly MAGA fucks I'm pulling the left lever across the boards every time these days.",

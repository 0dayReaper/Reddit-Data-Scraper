    "postText": "I used to have a neighbour who played ridiculously loud music in their garden until about 3 or 4 in the morning, when most people are trying to sleep, even though the noise is supposed to stop by 11pm.  I wouldn't have minded it being down to a reasonable level, but despite asking them to stop several times, as well as a LOT of complaints to the council, the noise continued.\n\nI initially bought a crazy daisy as a fun way to water the lawn, but one day I turned it on at about 1 am.  They thought it was starting to rain, and suddenly the music stopped and they went inside.  Blessed peace!\n\nFrom that day onwards, every time their 'party' noise disrupted my sleep, the tap went on at 11.30pm.",

Think Baby Shark or a death metal/thrash record with Cookie Monster vocals on shuffle.  People who like to party until the wee hours are easily disturbed.\nI work nights so sleep disturbances like this, while expected because I'm on an opposite schedule from everyone else, are particularly annoying.  It's one thing if our development hires a company to pressure wash or apply siding to the exterior of the house, it's another when your neighbors send their kids outside to scream and yell so they don't have to supervise or deal with them. I go to work when most people are getting ready for bed.  Keep me up on purpose and I'll move my car under your window and set my alarm off every 10 minutes on my nights off.",

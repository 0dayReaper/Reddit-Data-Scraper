    "postText": "It swept into my apartment at all hours of the night. There was a designated smoking area but that was inconvenient for them. I bought a massive water gun and waited one night until it was good and dark outside. When the smoke began, I stepped silently out into the night and sprayed all of the ice cold water as hard as I could into their direction. I heard them yelp in shock as I quickly retreated back into my apartment. My heart was racing and I had a huge thrill. I felt scared but satisfied. They had no way of knowing it was me, but they did know I often complained about them. The next day, I acted like nothing had happened and said hi to them cheerfully. They began to accuse me, I acted shocked and appalled until they admitted they didn\u2019t know for sure what had happened. I said things like \u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t raining?\u201d \u201cMaybe another neighbor smelled smoke and thought there was a fire?\u201d Then I went back home and laughed my ass off in glee.",

Luckily, I'd sat out a trail cam to catch them in the act of throwing cigs and trash and food off of it the night before just to prove to the idiot leasing office that they were trashing my patio every other night. Ended up catching gold instead. They had to pay a $250 fine AND for a pressure washing company to come clean all of my shit off. \n\nDidn't stop him from throwing stuff down afterwards. Ended up having to move because we had so many problems with the idiots who ran the joint just not caring about anything.",

Left her truck running, dual exhaust, radio *blasting*. I yell after her \u201cThe fuck! I can\u2019t get my horse out of here when I\u2019m done! Move your truck!\u201d To which she says \u201coh, I\u2019ll be right back\u201d and fucking left - just left. I can\u2019t leave my horse alone in the wash rack (backed over a ravine - for real) and I was on fire I was so pissed. So I *blasted that g-damn hose directly into her truck* for a full 10 minutes. My friend saw my predicament and moved the truck *just enough* for me to get out with my horse and I went back to my stall. This bitch comes back *another 15 minutes later* and squeals \u201cMY TRUCK, WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TRUCK!\u201d I didn\u2019t acknowledge her but at least five people in our barn said \u201cMaybe you parked too close to the wash rack and overspray happens. Horses are living breathing, moving animals after all.\u201d (With straight poker faces). \n\n*It was awesome*.\n\nETA she left the door open as well and I did *try* to spray my horse\u2026.mainly his right side but most of it got into the open door of her truck instead. And honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have a conversation with someone washing a horse if you didn\u2019t plan to get wet, especially when grooming for a show. It bounces off of them and comes back at you, gets caught in the wind, they lean into you. It\u2019s messy business that your $60,000 truck shouldn\u2019t be parked less than five feet away from and it was dangerous to my horse he could spook, get bit, not like her blasting radio or exhaust. I was literally trapped, it sucked.",

Had to run inside, get all the way up to my room, charge my phone just enough to turn the damn thing on, call AAA to jump it, and then race back down so I could at least be there with my car to prove I am legitimately broke down.

I just put her robe over her pj's and started taking her out to the car. There was a garage sale going on across the street, and some idiot had parked their car in my driveway, blocking me from getting out. I yelled \"Who's fucking car is this?\". No response. I ran over and asked people who owned the car in my driveway and no one would own up.\n\nI looked in the car and saw the keys were in it. I got in, started it up and backed out of the driveway, smoking the tires. I backed it about halfway down the street, then slammed it in park as I was going in reverse about 30mpg. Got out and took my kid to the ER. When I came back, the car was still in the middle of the street. One of the neighbors had it towed. I never heard a thing about it afterwards.

It got into all our bedding and cloths and we reaked. I told the office staff it was hurting us and they got concerned but would not let us move to a different unit. Apparently that was the only unit available when I could see people checking in and out all the time.\n\nWe should have checked out after the first week. It was a very toxic place. My girlfriend and I had loud sex one morning before she went to work and the security guard came by after accusing me of watching porn loudly. He got visibly threatening and confrontational to the point I was concerned he was going to assault me when I told him my girlfriend just left and we'll be more quiet next time. My girlfriend then said he started following her to the bus stop every morning after. I witnessed him doing it in his golf cart. Just following behind her for some reason.",

So they don\u2019t listen to the apartment complex rules and they don\u2019t respond or respond aggressively to neighbors asking them to quit smoking around them. \n\nAt least that\u2019s what I thought. I\u2019m a small woman and was a single mom raising two kids in an apartment with some creepy neighbors upstairs. One of their guests would always smoke away from the building but basically right in front of my sliding glass door and I had two little kids, one of whom had mild asthma. One day I just went up to him and said, \u201cI see you smoking away from the building and thank you for doing that. If you see where you are standing, the way the wind is right here, it pushes it right back into my unit. Would you mind moving to [pointed to a spot I knew was downwind from the building]? My kid has asthma and we would appreciate it so much.\u201d His expression changed from aloof to listening to agreeable and he apologized and said he\u2019d move and he never smoked in front of my apartment again. \n\nI credit the success of this interaction with not rushing through the conversation, validating the current situation, making a specific request, and using a respectful tone of voice and body language. \n\nTo be clear, I do not think this person was a trustworthy individual in ANY way based on other shit going on in that apartment and I was sweating bullets while talking to him. But it worked.",

Maine has(had?) a 50 foot law, but it gets cold in the winter and the nearest smoking shelter was on the opposite side of the building and about 50 yards down the road. So people would smoke under the awning over the door. My roommates and I usually had our windows cracked because the dorms were super hot, and we'd smell cigs constantly. After a while of asking politely, we got an arsenal of water balloons, super soakers and those little poppers you throw at the ground. We figured out my roommate could crawl out onto the awning from his window and we would drop water balloons or poppers on the smokers until they would leave. They knew it was us, but they couldn't complain to the school because there were signs everywhere about not smoking by the doors and they could get a citation from the police for smoking that close to a building.",

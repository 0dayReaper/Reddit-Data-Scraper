    "postText": "The scene:\n2006 Public viewing England football game in Cologne, Germany with around 30000 fans. Great atmosphere, lots of drinking. Heavily armed German police in riot gear all over the place.\n\nA drunk idiot rams me in the back spilling my drink and I stupidly retaliate by shoving him.\nHe then confronts me wanting to fight. I say I don't want to fight, but he won't give up.\nFollows me and keeps tugging at me saying, 'let's fight'.\nI realise he's not gonna stop and I don't want to get kicked out or arrested for fighting.\n\nI said to him ' Do you really want a fight? Follow me!'\nTook him all the way to a German riot policeman and said  'you wanna fight?, fight him'. Then I just turned around and started to go back to my mates.\nThe lad then gets angry and grabs me by my collar.\nThe german policeman then grabs him as I walk away.\nDidn't see him after that.\n\nTldr: wanna fight? Fight a German riot policeman.",

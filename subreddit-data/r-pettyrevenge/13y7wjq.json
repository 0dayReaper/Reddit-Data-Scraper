    "postText": "A guy I got into a row with on a Facebook group lied about his credentials online when he felt threatened by me, and started spewing nonsense about how I'm probably not a graduate of the school that's written both on my Facebook and my professional page. Prior to this, he was very rude, crass, and disrespectful to people that call him out on his bullshit -- instead of defending himself properly, he'll result to childish insults and personally attacking you when he has nothing else to back up his claims. He claims to be a religious educator, yet his actions show anything BUT religious.\n  \n\n  \nAnyway, he made the mistake of giving out his \"ID number\" and \"degree\" at School A (where a close friend of mine graduated), and his \"program\" that he was currently taking in School B (where I graduated, and is close with the program secretary) when we were having a row. A quick google search also connected me to his linkedin, where he has indeed listed both schools down, but it is very inconsistent with the entry/graduation dates he gave me.\n  \n\n  \nI let it slide for a day after the argument simmered down, but this morning, I noticed he took a very obvious jab at me at the same Facebook group we bickered at. It was written in our language, but it roughly translated to \"there's this one person here (in the comment section) that allegedly graduated from a prestigious university, but her personality is trash.\" As a naturally petty person, I obviously did not let it slide.\n\n* **First course of action:** I messaged the department in School B he was supposedly taking his Master's Degree in, reporting him by giving them what happened, the screenshots of just how rude, crass, and disrespectful he is. I also gave them his full name (which I sleuthed on my own), the year he supposedly entered the school, and the program he was taking.\n  \n***The answer from the program secretary?*** \"Hi Mr./Miss! Good afternoon. Mr. V is not a XXXX student. Thank you for raising this concern. We'll look into this matter.\" **Satisfaction** \u2714\ufe0f\n* **Second course of action:** I messaged the department he supposedly finished his Bachelor's from in School A. I gave them his full name, alleged ID number, the bachelor's degree he allegedly finished from this school, the years he was allegedly active from this school, as well as the same screenshots.\n  \n***The answer from the Dean himself?*** \"I don\u2019t know him and he had never been my student.\" **Satisfaction** \u2714\ufe0f\n  \n\n\nI'm biding for the right time to show these messages from the two departments for when he acts up again so he could finally shut up, but damn the satisfaction was real. Furthermore, when I changed my picture to a picture of me in my toga (which is very distinct, because my university toga has a logo on the left breast part), he also changed his picture to him posing at a public place in my university, where literally everyone could go without a problem since it was a Catholic church, and you can go there anytime as long as its daylight to pray or reflect.\n  \n\n  \nSorry this got so long lol I really needed a space to share my petty revenge.\n\nUpdate: Lol the dude was apparently stalking my Facebook account and stumbled across a My Day post. I posted about how I contacted the departments and they said they all didn't know him and he's now blowing up my messages with hate messages telling me they probably aren't said departments. Anyway,  lots of people who know him also saw my post and asked who it's about. Told them it's him and apparently he's mad that I exposed him online lol.\n\nUpdate 2: Found out that the dude completely plagiarized a paper! And the paper was originally written by a friend of mine. Welp looks like he just dug his own grave. I'll wait this one out and see where this goes.\n\nUpdate 3: Sorry, will delete the screenshots I posted. One of the schools will be conducting a formal investigation, so I'll have to keep them in private for now. Will update soonest!",

Someone from his department happened to go to the town that the university D was located in and had coffee with some staff, and said you must know 'john smith' ah yes, pity he never got around to finish his PhD - it would have been a good one. Turns out he had only done one year of his Phd. He was fired about a week later.",

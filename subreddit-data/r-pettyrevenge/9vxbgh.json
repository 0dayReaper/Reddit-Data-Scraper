    "postText": "I originally posted this as a comment on another post, but my SO thought it was worth sharing as a standalone. I'm adding a bit more detail and correcting some spelling and grammar. Also, posting from mobile, so apologies for formatting. Context: This happened in the early 90's and at the time the teacher had been teaching for 30 plus years. It was a rural area, so many of my friends parents had also suffered through at least one year of primary school with this awful woman. I've seen a grown woman cry recounting memories of her experiences --she was really that bad.\n\nMy second grade teacher took pride in being a mean old cunt to her students.  Wielding control over our tiny little bladders was something that gave her a particular satisfaction. One day during cursive lessons this kid named Joseph asked to use the bathroom. She told him he should've used the bathroom during morning recess and would have to wait until lunch. A little while later he started squirming in his seat and again asked to use the bathroom, this time with more urgency. At this point our teacher starts berating the kid by telling him he is a little baby for not holding his bladder like a big boy and suggesting that he should wear diapers. Joseph gets tired of her shit, stands up from his seat, stares her directly in the eye and proceeds to unleash the most epic man-sized piss he could muster. As fate would have it he was wearing those mesh material basketball shorts so the piss just flowed unobstructed down his legs and pooled on the carpet beneath him. A wave of giggling quickly spread through the classroom, which was basically the second grade equivalent of a slow clap. Our teacher just stood there dumbfounded for a moment before grabbing Joseph by the arm and dragging him off to the principal's office. As they exited the room Joseph glanced over his shoulder with a big grin on his face. \n\nA legend was born that day and we all enjoyed our newfound bathroom privileges for the remainder of the school year. Teacher retired the following year.",

My grandmother didn\u2019t believe me (caretaker as a child) and my teacher didn\u2019t believe me or give two shits because we had a \u2018guest\u2019 speaker in for the day. It was an officer doing a D.A.R.E  presentation and I was seated in the front of the class. \n\nI interrupted the presentation to ask if I could use the restroom, which I was denied. After my second attempt at \u201cI\u2019m going to be sick\u201d and could feel the floodgates rising in my throat, I let out the nastiest, thick raunchy smelling puke I can remember. I was so embarrassed about making a mess and felt bad, so I held my arms out on the sides of the desk to keep it from dripping onto the floor. This caused me to get covered in my own puke, which I trailed all the way down to the nurse/principals office. \n\nNeedless to say, I had a new class nick-name and was never second guessed about needing to use the bathroom. What a great child hood memory! ",

Asked twice to go to the bathroom, denied both times, then ran the fuck out of the room. I made it to the bathroom, but not to the toilet. It was everywhere. On the walls, the floor, all over me, I still don\u2019t know how that much vomit came out of my tiny body. I don\u2019t think she got in any trouble. ",

He was known for lying about it to get out of class; so the teacher said \"NO\".\n\nHe walked over to the wastebasket, unzipped, and did his business in the almost empty can.  Everyone was shocked into silence, and I can still remember the sound it made as his piss hit the can.\n\nTeacher flipped her lid, and he went to the office... he told me later that they called his Mom to let her know he was going to be suspended,  but when she found out why, *his Mom* flipped her lid, and made such a stink about it, that he didn't get suspended.",

The dumbass excuse the teacher gave was that they were prepping for a standardized test and that meant prepping their bladders, too. Holy fuck, I couldn't believe she was allowed to be so dumb and in charge of anything that peed. I told her, the principal and my kid that there would be no more asking. If she has to go she'll tell you and you'll let her or I'll become a vocal and litigious nusiance. This was a few years ago, and to this day I inform teachers of their new bathroom policy on those \"Things to Know About Your Child\" forms they send home at the start of a school year.",

The booty call was quite early that prom. The place was empty by 10 PM.\n\nThe senior who peed on the dance floor had a golf scholarship that got rescinded I believe.",

I told him it was an emergency and he still said no. I said as loud as I could that if he didn't let me go that I'd bleed all over my chair. He was extremely embarrassed and finally let me go.",

Cramps are more like a dull pain. Sometimes it can be like a dull headache with a 'pulsing' sensation. The 'pulsing' sensation in this instance is the feel of the tissue leaving your body.\n\nFor the most part, unless cramps have kicked things up a notch, my pad/tampon need to be changed, or I am thinking about when to next change my tampon/pad, I'm not paying much attention to what my body is doing. Every woman is different, though, so your millage may vary.\n\nI'd describe a period kind of like having a bloody nose or a runny nose. You know when the flow starts, and if you are using tissues to clog your nose, you know when the tissue gets saturated/when the bleeding stops. ",

Whenever you move you\u2019re going to squeeze some moisture out. \n\nIt can also take several years for a young woman\u2019s period to get into any kind of regularity time wise, and flow heaviness wise. Add in that they\u2019re novices at dealing with it, and may not be getting to choose what they use, and that\u2019s how you get more emergencies from teenage girls than adult women. \n\nPads are much nicer these days, too.

Stapled to my record is the note my mother wrote five years earlier. In her beautiful cursive handwriting is the most lovely passive-aggressive response possible. The note reads, in its entirety, \"Robert goes to the bathroom because he has to urinate.\"\n\nThe moment I saw that note I remembered how much I loved my mom, and how much I had lost.",

My 4th grade teacher did not like me getting to leave class for my constantly bleeding nose. So one day she told me to stand in the back of the class near the garbage till it stopped. It continued till the garbage was full of bloody tissues. I told her several times I could not get it to stop on my own and may I please go to the nurse. Eventually I\u2019m going to guess after about a half hour of losing blood I fainted. First time in my life. She had to call the nurse and I spent the rest of the day in the nurses office so the could make sure I didn\u2019t pass out again. The nurse committed to me how much blood was in the basket and why didn\u2019t you come here sooner? I was to dizzy to say to much about it just I was not aloud. \nProbably would have been fine had she let me go to the nurse in the first place.",

He said, \"No\" and I still went. Two of my friends went as well. When we returned he pulled us out into the hallway and had the principal on his way. \n\nHe told the principal we directly disobeyed him, which at my school was punishable by Out of School Suspension for 3 days, and you were never given a chance to defend yourself for such. However, my principal was new this year and decided to ask what the issue was, to which I responded we needed to drain the main vein and Mr. M wouldnt let us. She dismissed us and chewed him out.\n\nThe rest of the school year was just one large Captain Underpants story about how the tracher and we 3 would try to get at each other.",

I was a smart and well behaved kid. I asked to go to the restroom after I got the deep urgency in my bowels we all know and love.  I asked to go, but since we got back from recess she said no. I begged telling her it was an emergency but unfortunately I wasn\u2019t convincing or more likely she was a sadistic hag. I waited staring at the clock, wondering if I would make it. \nCrying I ask a final time and once again get told no. So I sat back down at my desk and shit my pants while a piece of me dies inside. It must have been obvious I had lost the battle. The sub quickly came over and sweetly told me I could go to the restroom now. I tried to gather myself but as soon as I got out of the room I run, bawling to the bathroom, I took off my panties flushing them down the toilet and trying to scrub what I can out of my pants. \nThankfully I was smart enough to go to the office and call my parents instead of going back to my class. Both of my parents showed up promptly and got that horrible woman fired. ",

She was livid and decided to smell all of our asses to see who the culprit was (seriously wtf). Most of us knew who it was, but nobody snitched.

I was gifted student, and could already read really well and write decently, in Kindergarten.  My grandmother was a retired English teacher, and taught me to read and write when I was around five.  My mother was getting divorced from my father and was working, so my Grandmother had a lot of time while she babysat, to teach me.\n\nI always got outstanding grades in everything except handwriting.  My mother couldn't figure out why, since my handwriting was really good at home.  I finally told her that I had to use my wrong hand in school, because if I used my left hand, and I was  left handed, I was beaten with a yard stick for **\"being evil\"**\n\nThis was 1969, parents didnt go off on teachers or schools back then.  My mother was furious, marched right down to the school with me in tow, and demanded to speak with the principal.  One of the few times I'd ever seen my mother lose it.  All hell broke loose, they did an investigation, and my teacher was \"retired.\"\n\nShe believed that being left handed was a sign of the devil.  She freely admitted to beating me on a pretty much daily basis to \"cure me.\" from being left handed.  It turned out that she had been doing this bullshit for years and no one had ever said anything before.  Corporal punishment was still common in schools then, so it didnt seem too far out of place.  This wasn't in the Bible belt either, it was in New England.",

So there was thing on Wednesday\u2019s where they would like have a mini service during school. So we had just gotten out of lunch and we were all asked to use restroom before going back to class. Me being a dumb little kid said I didn\u2019t have to go. So we get back to class and they call all the upper class men for the church thing. And during this time your not allowed to use the restroom. So that was about 20 minutes after I declined to use the restroom and I had asked to use the restroom maybe twice now and she said no you can\u2019t go cause the big kids are having church. So at this point I am sitting down with my  head glued to my table cause I\u2019m holding probably the biggest piss I had ever had to take in my life at that point. My teacher had to leave the room for some reason and she always picked the quietest person in the room to be the class monitor while she was out. So since I\u2019m over there keeping my head on my desk with the most intense face I\u2019ve ever had she picked me. I get up and go to the front of the class and I sit there stuff as a board. Then it gets too much for me too handle and I just let flood gates go in front of everybody. My teacher felt so bad that anytime I asked to go she\u2019d just let me go no questions asked. ",

I got the chicken pox while in her class, and was kept home from school as appropriate. My mom made arrangements to get my school work so I wouldn't be two weeks behind when I went back.\n\nOne day, my teacher shows up at our front door. She decided to \"deliver my homework\" which turned out to be code for \"demand to see snarkasaurus and her chicken pox covered body to prove that she's actually sick  and not just skipping school.\" So my mother, pissed off, has me stand at the top of the stairs and open the blanket I'm wearing as my only clothing to show the old biddy that no, really, she's sick. I had a pretty bad case of it and was covered head to toe in blisters. Old bitch actually looked shocked that I really had chicken pox. ",

We had a day where the cafeteria wasn't open for whatever reason so we ate lunch in class. Teacher still wouldn't let us leave the classroom even though it was our lunch break. She told us to wait until recess which was over an hour away. A classmate of mine wouldn't stop squirming since shortly after lunch. Poor kid ended up pissing himself a few minutes before we were to be let out of class. He ended up getting yelled at and banned from that days recess. When his parents found out they were obviously furious and pressured the school board to take action. The teacher ended up getting fired at the end of the school year. I really don't understand how some people are allowed to be anywhere near children",

I really really had to go. I raised my hand to ask, my teacher said no.\n\n I waited a bit, realized I want gonna be able to make it to lunch, recess, or whatever the next break was. I raised my hand again. He looked at me occasionally, but ignored me. He was lecturing &amp; it was not \"question time.\" I put my hands down, clenched. Waited some more, then put my hand back up. Repeat one more time. \n\nEventually said fuck it. Just got up &amp; left. Came back. He asked what I thought I was doing. I told him it was the bathroom or the floor. Eventually, they whole class started going when they needed to.",

    "postText": "I noticed my spotify had a PS4 with a German name connected to it, which is odd because *I don't have a PS4*. Spotify was unable to disconnect me from it using my account, so I decided to take it into my own hands and blast Attila at full volume on their PS4 at midnight Germany time. I think they may have been in game since they let it go for a few seconds then attempted going to the next/previous songs and pausing it a few times (to no avail). Eventually they uninstalled spotify and I changed my password, but damn that felt good.",

And I don't listen to Disney but yet all of a sudden there's all this Disney recently listened on my Spotify. Spotify would not take any ownership. Kept blaming him. Podcast hosts were saying that they get emails all the time from other users saying the same thing is happening. These are mostly tech-savvy people that would know better than to stay logged in on some college campus computer.\n\n My own Spotify which is logged in on more than just my phone but nothing anyone else would have access to is always coming up with random ass songs that it claims I recently listened to. I don't know why. I change my password and logout of everything and so on and so forth so many times at this point I just ignore it. Whoever is using my Spotify listens to some pretty weird stuff but I've been introduced to some cool stuff too.",

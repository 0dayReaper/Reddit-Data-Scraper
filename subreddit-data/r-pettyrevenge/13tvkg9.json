    "postText": "Context : two weeks ago, i was enjoying a restaurant meal with three friends. \nEverything went well until a mom and her two hellspawns sat on the exterior of the restaurant leaving her two banshees running and shrieking. \nI first got up and asked kindly if she could call them because we are kinda trying to enjoy a meal without having her two hellspawns running and shrieking.\nTo which i have been met with a \"deal with that\" \nLess than 5 minutes later, both fell face flat on the ground of the street, crying. \nShe finally got up and gave me dirty look thinking i tripped them on purpose. \nTo which i said \"deal with it. They had it coming by not looking where they go\"",

So I went one night knowing I wasn\u2019t going to be eating there but acted like everything was normal and we sat down and ordered drinks. Sure enough they started up with the antics so I calmly got up, left cash on the table for tip and drinks, walked their horrified and tearful assess out the door and went home and had pb and j for dinner with an early bedtime. Problem solved.",

I think each one tried a public tantrum, but only once. They got an instant swat and were taken home. We would only need the look and ask if they needed a \u201cspanky\u201d in front of everyone for them to dial it in. We hardly had to spank them anyways, usually just the threat was enough. And no, we didn\u2019t beat or abuse them. But sometimes the shock of a swat and humiliation is enough to modify their behaviour. From then on, they were angels. Not only with us, but when they went out with others too. I actually have had people come up to me in stores and restaurants and sometimes even come to my workplace (I live in a small town) to let me know how impressed they were with my children\u2019s behaviour and good manners. I remember one particular occasion when my son had just turned 2 and we took a trip to Vegas. We went to a very high end restaurant that didn\u2019t normally allow children under 12 (not a bar or club or anything like that). They made an exception for us, and several staff and clientele came up to our table to commend our son\u2019s behaviour and our parenting. We absolutely rewarded our kids\u2019 good behaviour, and punished them for behaving badly. Sometimes punishment would take the form of us just telling them how disappointed we were with their behaviour. Consistency is key, I cannot emphasize that enough. That and making sure they understand exactly why they are being rewarded or punished. Not saying that my way is the perfect way, but I have 4 amazing \u201ckids\u201d (15 to 25 years old) and both my husband and I were raised the same way.",

The key was as soon as they decided to act up I gave a warning that we would leave- and then I immediately did just that- out to the car and home with them. They got upset because they would usually get something small if they had been good while out, and I was upset because it messed up what I had planned to do while out with them. Idle threats never work, and kids need to learn how to behave in social settings. Giving in to misbehaving only makes it a perpetual problem, so you have to follow through on what you said about behaviour. It only happened three times at most, and then life was calm when we went out.",

She had a complete meltdown and I had to carry her, kicking and screaming, all the way through the mall!  It was so humiliating, but I had no choice, had to get her home.  And it was a long walk to the car.\n\nI dumped her in the door at home with her dad and went back to finish my shopping.  Came home later and he had taken her back to the mall photo shop and gotten absolutely adorable photos.  She was always a Daddy\u2019s girl, but it wasn\u2019t her fault, we just had to wait much too long and she couldn\u2019t handle it.  I don\u2019t recollect her ever having a tantrum in public again.  She certainly never ran wild in a mall or a restaurant at any age and did not approve of kids who did.",

Enter a mum, 40-ish, with two girls aged approx 8 &amp; 10, with 8yo screeching on a plastic recorder! I was in the queue for second coffee when said mum joined right behind me. I caught her eye and she shrugs and says \u201cI can\u2019t say a word, I bought her it\u201d in a conspiratorial manner. I said politely, \u201ccould you maybe ask her not to do it in here?\u201d Mum then proceeds to verbally abuse me in front of the whole shop, shouting that I was rude and aggressive, before yelling across to the girl that the \u2018old woman\u2019 *doesn\u2019t like the noise. The three members of staff and several customers told me I had done nothing wrong, that they had heard the entire conversation and that HER attitude was appalling!!!  \u2018 \nI mean, on what planet is it acceptable to give your child a noisy toy with which you give them permission to make a nuisance of themselves, especially in a place where people just want to chill and have a conversation? What chance do kids have with parents like that???",

I couldn\u2019t help but give her dirty looks and I thought about asking her to take her kid outside or at least try to calm him down. Instead I put in my earbuds and started an audio book, in fear of exactly what you just described. When I was a child I was taught not to behave like that in public. I get that being a parent can be frustrating, but she literally did nothing. After about 20 minutes she took her kid outside and you could still hear him screaming.",

Mine stuck in some Ws:  *a-pwo-pwi-et*.  Their tiny mouths just can't manage all of those Ps in there (and, obviously, none of the Rs. Ha)!  And they are so sincere when saying it.  The combination is endearing... hands down, in my top 5 memories of their young years. \n\nI never called what they did 'bad' or 'good' (because kids internalize that into \"I'm bad\" and therefore can't control being bad, which I definitely didn't want to do to them) ... it was appropriate for the situation or not.  And we would discuss *before* we left the house if they thought they could conform to appropriate behavior.  Then I reminded them in the car in the parking lot.  \n\nApproach an outing like this, and you have maybe 1 public tantrum ever.  You leave, talk about inappropriate behavior (again), and that they broke that agreement.  Then, remind them how a parents job is to raise a responsible, respectful, productive member of society, and you aren't doing your job if you let them act like that.  They get the idea right away that it's on the parent, too, and we have obligations to *help them become good people* (and that society won't put up with this kind of crappy behavior, so *just stop now*).   They learn not to behave that way in public again... and to look to you for advice and guidance.  \n\nI also taught my kids some simple sign language when they were babies.  About 10 signs.  They can do that long before they can speak.  They didn't have tantrums at home, either.  Never a kid crying because they couldn't tell me they were hungry or wanted to be done with an activity.  Incidentally, mine told me when they wanted their diapers changed and were tired for naps, too.  You can absolutely teach young kids to learn what their body is saying about why they are uncomfortable and what will make them feel better!  I think I had a half-dozen tantrums.  Period.  The first one at home, I told them I would not respond to that and they needed to approach this another way.  The second time, I just ignored it.  In public?  The. Fun. Is. Over.  They learned fast that a tantrum *does not* get them what they want.  Ever.",

Every trick in the book and tips from friends and even strangers just didn't work. No calmness, no ignoring, no yelling, no spankings, no reverse psychology... Nothing.\n\nThen one day a temper tantrum again. Completely exasperated the mother tells her, that if she wanted to scream, she would have to scream - for 10 minutes. She continued screaming. Eventually she stopped, but her mother told her timing her on her watch, that it hadn't been 10 minutes yet, so she needed to continue screaming. In the end, my friend had a very long nap - and NEVER had a temper tantrum again.",

She stood in silence till she paid and got the hell out of the store. Now, I know kids melt down and there\u2019s nothing you can do, but the other posts in here  tell me that you can, as a parent, not reward the tantrum behaviors and you can try to correct them before they become a problem.

His half siblings pick on him and the deadbeat does not care, as long as he doesn't have to deal witb the kids.\n\nThat overcompensating is backfiring on her so badly. She fusses and fusses and FUSSES, but she never follows up on the consequences.\n\nA few weeks ago, my husband and I picked up Nana for an early dinner, and we didn't ask the mother to yo with us. I did being back something to her, which I didn't have to do. But there was no way I was going out with him acting like wild child. I would never have let my son get away with that, so I couldn't deal with her son acting like that.\n\nHer son will he starting school in August. At the rate it is going, she will be called in to the school, often. Then there is also the issue that he will be bigger than she is in no time. She's not doing either of themselves a favor.\n\nI can relate to the guilt that parents can have, especially when the other DNA donor is a piece of work, but the parents' main job is to prepare the child for the world. I am hoping Nana and I can get through to her.",

Well, we went to a local sandwich and pizza shop that I frequent quite a bit. Those kids ran back and forth yelling and screaming from one end to the other it was like a very long hallway with a door at the end of it and a door Midway to the left opposite the entrance to the kitchen. Back and forth back and forth back and forth they went. Other patrons were giving me the stink eye thinking that I was their dad and how dare I not discipline them! I vowed to myself that if she and I went out again and she brought them I was not going to stand idly by. Sure enough we went out next week and this time I asked her to deal with it again and when she didn't I did. They weren't used to having a male authority figure. When they started and after three warnings, I put them both back next to their mother with a small love tap on the seat of their pants. It was no way hard or anything like that but the shock of it kept them quiet for the rest. By the fourth time we went there they were nice calm children. Had one or two other issues along the way over the next couple of years, but I dealt with it LOL",

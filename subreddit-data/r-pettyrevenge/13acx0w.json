    "postText": "I had a roommate many many years ago that was bipolar. No issue at all as long as he took his meds, and I found out after moving in that he'd regularly stop taking them. At that point, I had two weeks until an explosion, then a week or two after that he'd feel crappy enough (thank you, depressive episodes) to get back on them. He was from the country, and a plant pathology major, highly allergic to poison ivy...and couldn't recognize it. Didn't even know it had three leaves. No joke. When he kept causing problems for me again and again and again and again, I used the tendency of mutual friends to gossip to get a bit of petty revenge.  There was a very nice holly bush between the duplex front doors. Now, holly has individual leaves that are very tough and solid, shiny, and pointy. Poison ivy has thin, floppy, soft leaves in groups of three. Holly is a tree or bush. Poison ivy is, well, ivy.  I mentioned to the friends that the \"holly\" bush was basically a big pile of poison ivy and there wasn't much holly left, so be careful not to touch it. Unmedicated roommate cut it down to the ground. We were renters. Manager was not impressed....",

Took him seven months to get me to retaliate at all, and then since he wasn't medicated he was irrational and super paranoid. I just had to stop doing a few things around the house that I'd been doing for him. Wiping down the bathroom to keep out sugar ants, or tightening the ceiling fan blades as they worked loose every few weeks (he was MUCH taller so it was his head they'd hit), quit spraying for and pulling poison ivy. Quit treating the yard for fire ants and so they got into it, then got into the wall by his closet. Stopped fixing the seal on the dishwasher so it leaked everywhere.  I'm sure he thought it was sabotage and went crazy(er) trying to figure out how I did it all.  One of my current friends is bipolar to the point of being disabled, and she takes her medicine religiously and has been a great person.  I figure when the adults around you are upset at your behavior and it only happens when you stop taking the meds, when you get aggressive and mean and your roommates keep moving out when you stop, and the doctors prescribed them in the first place, anyone who isn't a selfish jerk will take them.",

One of the more evil boys who used to pick on me all the time laughed and said that couldn't possibly be poison ivy and touched it.\n\nYou all know what happened, right? On the way home during the long bus ride, his hands broke out in blisters and so did his face where he'd rubbed it. This was decades before cell phones were a thing. The teachers had to have the bus pull over at a drug store where they bought some aspirin (not sure how that would help, but there you are).\n\nI'd like to say that I got more respect after that, but I didn't.",

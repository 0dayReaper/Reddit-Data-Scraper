    "postText": "I live in an apartment with very thin walls. I accepted that I will hear noises, and I\u2019m ok with that because that\u2019s just what happens when you live in an apartment. My upstairs is the loudest person I know. He comes back to his place late at night with his music in his car blasting, and his assigned space is right in front of my bedroom. It doesn\u2019t help that he likes to sit in there for 10 mins with the music blasting before he actually goes in. I hear him vacuuming, doing laundry, and using the dishwasher in the middle of the night. But I just put in earplugs and go back to sleep. \n\nMy main issue is he likes to keeps all his windows open with his tv at high volume AT NIGHT. It\u2019s so loud it sounds like if I turned on my own tv and blasted it. I\u2019m also a college student in an intense program, so I\u2019m constantly studying. I tried using ear plugs, but the tv is just so loud. So I asked him if he can turn down his tv because I\u2019m trying to study, and he did the first few times I asked him. However the issue kept persisting, and I even reminded him on our lease quiet time is from 10pm-8am. At this point I think he was just annoyed by me and turned his tv on even louder! I tried filing a noise compliant, but honestly not much came out of it. \n\nOne night when I was studying for my finals, I heard his loud dreadful tv. Again I went up and asked if he can turn down his tv. He did not. I\u2019m already stressed for this final, and stressed because I couldn\u2019t study in this type of environment. I felt like breaking down and crying in that moment, but I really needed that A. Which is where I had the bright idea to connect my lecture I was listening to, to my speaker and put it on full blast. I stacked chairs on my table where it would be high enough for the speakers to be pressing on the ceiling. It was so loud I could feel my ceiling vibrate. 10 minutes passed by, and I hear my door bell ring. I opened the door to see my lovely upstair neighbor. He asked if I could quiet down which I respond back with \u201csorry your tv was so loud I couldn\u2019t hear my lecture\u201d. He huffed and turn on his tv even LOUDER. I went to my car and parked at a quiet place since eveything was closed. I may have lost the battle, but I was going to win this war. \n\nOn our lease it says marijuana is prohibited on the property, and if they found out a tenant are in possession of weed they will be evicted. My upstair neighbor smokes weed everyday. The smell doesn\u2019t really bother me because I\u2019m a pothead myself, but I just don\u2019t smoke tree on the property since I\u2019m paranoid about getting evicted. Also when I would go up to talk to him, I noticed he had a huge jar of weed behind him. Anyways the next day I smelled him lighting up. I called the leasing office that there\u2019s a strong odor of what smells like marijuana coming from upstairs. He also smokes on his balcony for everyone to see. I was peeping through my window to see if the property manager was coming by. I see her, see him, smoking. Then I heard her go upstair and knock on his door. I couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying but I was really hoping she saw his jar of weed. Several days passes and I see him moving his stuff out. I didn\u2019t want to stoop that low, but he pushed me to that point. Now I have a great upstair neighbor that I have no problems with.\n\nTLDR: noisy neighbor wouldn\u2019t stop being noisy,so I reported him for using marijuana, and he got evicted.",

I find that if I have to remind someone to have common courtesy, they never had it in the first place. It was always going to that place between you and ol boy. Now he's going on to be someone else's problem. \n\nPpl who are incapable of thinking of anyone else but themselves are not mentally handicapped. They're shit birds. Play no games with them moving forward. \n\nCongrats btw!",

Was about to switch the rofo out with an old, made in Japan, Alpine 6ch. gem from the 90's that my friend dropped of to see if it still worked. It does! Anyways...\n\nAt every red light, I'm turning it down. Thru my neighborhood, the same. Pull up at a friends house? Same. I try to keep common courtesy. Sometimes it's slips and I can get that. We're human.\n\nBut, it sounds like we're not intentional dicks. We're just human. I won't rat you out. But, then again, I would imagine you wouldn't be excessive like OPs neighbor. To do it time and time again after being told is intentionally being an asshole. Being 'spatially disinclined' is understandable. There is no malicious intent.",

So even if you have headphones on you can feel the vibrations through the thin walls. It\u2019s the first time I had extremely violent thoughts. Coincidentally, they eventually got evicted for dropping cigarettes out their windows and setting a bush on fire. It seems that jerk neighbors have the same behaviors.",

She put a note on her door that said \"sorry, the music is so loud, my fish has anxiety\" it was ridiculous.

Mostly because the heating/cooling system was central and shared with all units, even if she sprayed air fresheners, it wouldn't matter. It got sucked into the vent, and pumped into every other unit. She would have several guys over a day and have the loudest sex ever. She also had a dog, which pets were banned, and she let it bark all day and would often leave it home alone for days. Yes, DAYS.\n\nShitty neighbors happen, but one day, I came to work smelling like weed because I walked past her door to get out. I got asked why by my boss. I explained it and he understood, still embarrassing. \n\nThat was the last fucking straw. \n\nI told the leasing office, they came to check on a day she was gone.

But I live in a red state and cops will bust anyone for it. They busted her, took her weed, and give her a ticket. \n\nI took a copy of that report, and listed all of my other complaints, and sent it to the leasing office. \n\nShe was out by the end of the week. \n\nDon't be a shit neighbor.",

When you met him outside he was just all normal, but as soon as he shut the door to his apartment, everything changes.\n\nWhatever he was doing, all of it was quite loud even when he was yawning (my bedroom was next to his living room and he woke me up at 11pm by yawning extremely loud).\nSometimes he would talk to himself very loudly and one time in summer (where nearly everyone sleeps with open windows) his TV was blaring extremely loud through his open windows at 11pm. Atleast when I hit the wall with my fist, he turned it down really fast.\n\nBut there was also another tenant right below us, who seemed to have the party of his life.\n\nWhen I came home from work on a friday I heard loud music with bass coming from his apartments. Well cool, someone celebrates the weekend, no problem for me. In my apartment I could only hear the bass, but it did not disturb my sleep in any way.\n\nWhen I woke up Saturday morning, his music was still playing. Wow. To my disbelief this continued throughout the whole weekend until I fell asleep sunday evening. Monday morning music was still blaring.\n\nHe finally turned the music off Tuesday late evening. On wednesday he was gone (moving out) and with the next weekend we had a new friendly and quiet tenant moving in.\n\nStill had the loud yawner next door, but these were only minor disturbances which fortunately did not happen too often until I moved out.",

Instead of continuing his loud TV use, he also started to bang on my door, bang on his floor (my ceiling), throw rocks at my window (he actually broke one). He threatened me a couple if times (this kid was huge, like he looked like a white Dwayne Johnson). Landlord said his hands were tied due to the type of lease the kid had (yeah, right). Turns out the kid was on a very special kind of scholarship, one that had a morality and behavioral clause, so I reported his behavior to his committee and they threatened to strip him of the scholarship if he didn\u2019t move immediately. He didn\u2019t move out until the semester ended, but he didn\u2019t stay there either. All I ever asked him to do was to please turn down the volume; don\u2019t turn the tv off, just down. I tried three different sets of earplugs, noise-reducing headphones, nothing worked. It made me sad to report him but I had the right tk be able to sleep at 11 PM.",

There were two entrances into the building and depending what side you entered the first door on the right would be mine or his. One night some guys were coming to get drugs from them and pounded on my door screaming till I answered and said you have the wrong apartment. They constantly smoked weed too. So one day I was trying to work at home and the music was so loud I couldn\u2019t even think. I left my apartment went to the leasing office and complained. I had had enough. I got back upstairs and went to go into my apartment and the hallway reeked of weed. I didn\u2019t smell it when I left because I was used to it cause it was constantly smelling up the hallway and my living room. But I knew they would be in trouble if the lady came up to tell them to quite down\u2026. Needless to say she came up and they were evicted within a day. While moving out I got dirty looks and one flipped off my door as I peaked through the peep hole. Needless to say I did not want them evicted just to quite down but hey after they left it was much quieter!",

            "comment": "I had a similar issues like yours when I was living in an apartment with my family when I was a kid. This was back in the mid to late 00s, and these were the issues.\n\n1: People would come and sit in the parking lot with their car stereos all blasting so loud with the bass completely maxed out that we couldn\u2019t have anything hanging on the walls. Well after dealing with that for five months, I finally had enough, and I got out of bed and told my father that I couldn\u2019t sleep because of the loud music(garbage to me now) that was being blasted outside. So my father called the police and they came and put an end to it by telling the people to leave. And that was FCAT week(I live in Florida and honestly the FCAT was a far superior tests than what they replaced it with).\n\n2: then another incident was when my brother had just crossed the parking lot after throwing the garbage into the trash, this car came flying on into the parking lot with all of these police officers got on the person\u2019s tail. It turned into a SWAT Standoff. \n\n3: but the final straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was the people who lived down stairs below us. When one day my mom goes down and kindly asks them to turn down their stereo as she was trying to get my sister to sleep. The person that answered told her that they didn\u2019t have a stereo and then told my mom to tell her(us) kids to stop stomping around upstairs. Which we weren\u2019t. So after that she told us to please be quiet and walk. Well we did, and then we heard the music again although our mom thought it was us. But she goes down again and ask them to please turn down whatever it is they have up so loud. Third time our mom came back up and told us that if we heard the music again to come and tell her. Well me and my two brothers were laying on the floor with our ears to it. And sure enough we heard the stereo start up again and we\u2019re able to pinpoint exactly which room it was in.\n\nMy mom goes down stair knocks on their door, and before she can kindly explain to them that she could hear the stereo up stairs. The person cursed her off and threatened to come upstairs and break her kids(our) legs if they didn\u2019t stop stomping around. Before slamming the door in her face. We moved out of that apartment and into a better one two weeks later and she was able to get her deposit back because of that threat alone from the tenants below her without having to break lease.\n\nOh and you made it onto YouTube.

Hard to believe there isn't a library, student study halls, etc within a few minutes. Apartments were always a terrible place to study in college for the reasons you list and many more. Gonna have to learn to be more creative if you want to make it after graduation or its going to be a rude awakening when you hit the real world. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso - if you smoke in your apartment look into getting a smoke buddy or similar type spoof/filter product. Very helpful when living in close proximiy to others.\n\n[https://smokebuddy.com/](https://smokebuddy.com/)",

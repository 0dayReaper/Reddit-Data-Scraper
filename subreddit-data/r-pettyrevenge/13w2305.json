    "postText": "Years ago I taught \"very specific skills training\" at a local vocational college.\n\nIt was rare for the school to actually fail anyone, even with terrible attendance, failing tests, incompetence...yeah, frustrating for instructors and for students who actually TRIED and did well... Most students were amazing and I really miss that aspect of the job, and even keep in touch with some of them professionally.\n\nClasses were 12-40 students (if above 24 or so I would have a co-teacher) In every group there was often one or two, maybe three \"bad apples\" In this class of 26, there were two - let's call them A and B, they had terrible attendance, failed tests, were generally incompetent, but KNEW the school would pass them, and sure enough they did both get their diploma. \n\nSeveral years later I was at a job site, and in walks B with a resume. \n\nB sees me talking with owner and manager...Can I just say that I had a really, really hard time not busting into laughter at the look on B's face? I was however professional and courteous as B handed over the resume and left. After which the manager turns to me and asks if B was a former student of mine. To which I replied with \"Yes, yes they were.\" Dead serious face. Manager says \"So... what do you...\" then just sees my face, and says \"Oh, I see, thank you.\" Resume goes directly into shredder. We all move on with our meeting. \n\nLater that evening at home I'll admit I did a little happy dance.\n\n*edited for grammar, also this was in the 2010's",

But those people generally have secured work in by knowing some people related to the uni...\n\nYes, private universities can be expensive and very easy too pass. But if you know, you won't employ people of those places. Like is worth to showing off graduates, not actually knowing a lot.\n\nNote: In my country, not usa uk aus",

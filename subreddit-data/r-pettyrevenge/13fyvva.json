    "postText": "This happened over 30 years ago so I confess some of the details are probably screwed up.  That said....\n\nTowards the end of my freshman year in college I decided that it would be nice to have a motorcycle to get around town/campus with the next year.  With this in mind, I saw/answered an ad on a corkboard in the dorms and... Well, I bought a 200 cc bike.  Top speed was about 50 mph, but it was perfect for getting around town!\n\nThe title seemed a bit off, but the owner assured me it was fine.  I went to the DMV to reregister the bike and... Yeah, the title was all fucked up.  I don't remember all the details, but I know it took several weeks to clear up and I had to pay like an extra $100.\n\nCue the revenge.\n\nA couple required points of knowledge....\n\n1)  The dude I bought the bike from was a student and the bike did have a valid parking sticker on it.  Obviously, our boy had paid the money to get the sticker which in turn meant that as far as the school was concerned, this bike belonged to him (parking stickers were linked to student + license plate).\n\n2) The school didn't have a \"real\" police force, but it loved giving out citations for all sorts of stuff.  The citations weren't legally binding in the normal sense, but the school wouldn't allow you to register for the next semester, graduate, etc. unless all fines had been paid.\n\nWith the two knowledge points in mind, I thus began parking anywhere I felt like.  Why park in the parking lot when you can ride on the sidewalk and just park next to the door of the building?   I spent the last three weeks of the semester collecting 1-2 parking tickets every day.\n\nI don't know what the bill for all those tickets was, but I do remember thinking that he was going to owe more in fines than I had paid for the bike (including the title fiasco).",

I lived in a different US state where you could leave the plate on the vehicle and indicate that on the title transfer document.\n\nThe reason I even remember this is the big argument I got into over the telephone with an employee of my auto insurance company. When I called to report the car sold, so I could stop paying for insurance on it, the agent got really upset with me, claiming repeatedly that he was going to report me to the DMV for breaking the law.\n\nThe agent wasn't able to explain why the title transfer form had a place to indicate whether or not the plate went with the car. The agent ended up calling me a liar and I ended up hanging up and calling back to speak with a different agent.\n\nAgent #2 was fine to deal with. She agreed with me that leaving the plate on the car was indeed legal in my state and processed the change politely.\n\nLooking back, I wish I had asked for someone to listen to the tape of agent #1 calling me a liar, but at the time I was just glad to be done with it.",

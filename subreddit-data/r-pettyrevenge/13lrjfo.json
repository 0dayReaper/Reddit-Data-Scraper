    "postText": "I'm not a great story teller but here goes.\n\nThis happened about a year ago. When we bought and gutted our house I had ordered a whole new high efficiency HVAC system on line from a retailer I had bought from before. Good so far. My local HVAC guy had done the duct work and installed the system. Everything ran fine. When we finally moved in we noticed the second floor was a bit warm and called our guy. Unfortunately he decided to retire. So I call another company and they come out to check the system. Realize that the condensor is too small for our house as well as the main trunk is too small. (They were speced together by the online retailer). Well of course I'm not happy but swallow it and order a larger condenser from the online retailer while the HVAC guy changes the main trunk. The new unit was supposed to be freighted in after my vacation at the beach. Awesome.\n\nWell awesomeness didn't last long. While on vacation I get a notification that the unit had been delivered. I thought it strange because it was 3 weeks ahead of schedule and my doorbell cam didn't go off. So I open my doorbell cam and I certainly see the unit but the unit is 60 feet away on the street! WTF?! I immediate call the online retailer and tell them that I'm not home and the delivery company left the unit in the street and I need them to at least get it onto the porch. They didn't care.... Kept saying, \"Not our problem, we're not the delivery company\" They refused to call the delivery company or help in anyway. I keep trying to get to a supervisor to talk to them about the situation but the CS rep refused to do it. After 45 mins on the phone they just disconnected me. (**Note:** I didn't get all Karen on anyone) At this point I'm panicking because someone is certainly gonna see it and it's gonna be thrown on the back of a pickup by some thief. Finally I call a friend who leaves work and and grabs his father in law. They manage to wrangle this monstrosity into the back yard. Disaster averted.\n\nAt this point though I am seriously pissed. Then I remember I paid for the unit via Paypal. So just to mess with them and be petty I filed a grievance with Paypal  for the $3700.00 I paid for the unit. I wholly expected this to go no where as the seller would have proof of delivery etc etc. It was more just to be petty not really expecting anything.  So now it's almost 2 weeks later and I get an email that Paypal is refunding my $3700!!!! I'm incredulous! Apparently Paypal tried to contact them several times with no response so they just gave it back to me. Woohoo!!! I did set the money aside in case the online retailer tried to come after me. After 6 months though they didn't. It's been a year now and not a peep. That money gave my wife and I a very nice weekend getaway.  Thanks for the free condenser OR!!\n\n**Note**: Since my old one was less than a year old and almost no time on it, my HVAC guy sealed it back to factory and I sold it on FB marketplace for $1600 bux. So not only did I get a free upgrade, I made some money! Bonus!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: For those that asked why I didn't call the delivery company, there was only a freight number available on the Online Retailer's site that showed where it was. I only know that it was a local freight company. ",

            "comment": "Several years ago, I was the purchasing coordinator for a home warranty company. If an appliance or HVAC equipment needed to be replaced, I worked with the homeowner, contractor and/or manufacturer to order, deliver and install the equipment.\n\nLate one Friday afternoon, a homeowner I\u2019d been working with, \u201cFay,\u201d called upset. \u201cMiss RumBunBun, the delivery company brought my refrigerator, but they left it on the sidewalk by the street. I thought you said they would bring it into my kitchen and hook up the ice maker!\u201d I assured her that yes, that is what they were supposed to do. She told me she lived in a high crime area and the refrigerator would not be there long. (She told me \u201cthe vultures are already circling\u201d). I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t sign for it, did you?\u201d She told me she was no fool, of course she hadn\u2019t. \n\nI called my manufacturer\u2019s rep (I think it was Frigidaire or Whirlpool) and told them the problem. They said it was 20 minutes before 5 pm customer\u2019s time so they probably couldn\u2019t get the delivery co. back out until Monday. I knew Fay was not going to be happy, plus I just really liked her (she was so funny and sassy, and dammit, she\u2019d been without a fridge for 4 or 5 days already). So I said, \u201cWell, you might mention to the delivery company that our contract states that the appliance needs to be set up/installed and our customer did not sign for it, so it isn\u2019t our refrigerator yet. I assume if it\u2019s stolen, you\u2019ll bill the delivery company $1200, right?\u201d \n\nHe called the delivery company, mentioned the $1200, and they went back to Fay\u2019s house and installed her fridge. (She told me they tried to leave without hooking up the ice maker, but she scolded them and refused to sign until it was good to go!)",

The guy would wheel the pallet to our patio (which has a roof) and we could unload it.  New guy came and flat out refused to put it any closer than the sidewalk in front of our business (frustrating- particularly when we were expecting afternoon showers).  Then he tried to deliver it to the small parking lot two doors down (where he has to offload it if he wants a sidewalk).  That absolutely didn\u2019t fly because it\u2019s not our property. So he came in the backroad and backed into our lot.  Ok.  There\u2019s a door there\u2026 not the one we need to off load into, but as long as it is out of the way of customers, fine.  But since we were ok with it, he pulled up next to the entrance to the parking lot and put it just barely on our property.  This is not a 53 foot trailer truck, just a regular lift gate truck. \n\nThe final straw was setting it on the edge of the property out front on a busy street (street side of the sidewalk) in the rain and claiming we didn\u2019t pay for lift gate service and therefor we are lucky that he took it off the truck for us at all.  Except that we aren\u2019t allowed the option of not paying for lift gate because we don\u2019t have a loading dock\u2026and it was on the receipt.  We sent an email to our supplier, cc:d to the transport company stating that we will never accept a delivery from this company again and they need to use another supplier.\n\nI still see this truck (and lazy driver) around town.  Last time was at the corner of a busy intersection where the driver had clearly blocked the road long enough to dump the pallet of the unfortunate company in the middle of the sidewalk and there was a trail of employees is suits carting heavy items between cars 50 yards across a parking lot \u2026 yes, in the rain. \n\nWhich ring would Dante put that driver in.",

Tracking indicated that they had it in their truck so I met the truck at the local loading point.  They let me see the inside of the truck (empty).  Then they let me examine their \"warehouse\" (a couple of conex boxes in an RV parking facility).  And lo.... While I did not find my box, I found a box addressed to me that had been there long enough to have a nice coating of dust.  I'd forgotten I'd even ordered [stuff in other box].\n\nThe original box (a computer) showed up the next day with a box that had been opened.  I'm pretty sure the driver was hoping to keep it for himself but when I was obviously going after it, he brought it back....\n\n\nSeriously, FedEx Ground is bad enough that if I know a vendor will ship FG I'll find another vendor.",

I begged him to have them come that afternoon instead of whenever it was scheduled for. We argued back and forth for a few minutes, but ultimately compromised on a time that was later than he wanted, but earlier than I wanted. It was the best they would agree to, so I accepted it and thanked him. \n\nThe day of the delivery, I had to get off work early (which meant dealing with the wrath of the psycho boss I had at the time). I raced home to arrive just in time for our agreed upon delivery appointment. And found my brand new couch sitting at the edge of my driveway, almost in the road. It was \u201csignature required,\u201d but the paperwork was simply left with the package. It was also raining outside. I don\u2019t recall the exact number now, but it had been delivered significantly earlier than our appointment.\n\nLuckily, my sister was coming to town later that evening, and my neighbor across the street had her 20 year old son crashing with her for the moment, so I borrowed him. Between the 3 of us, we just barely were able to heft it across my driveway, up my short staircase, and into my house. And thank God (and my helpers!) for that! But I was so pissed at Fedex for the whole ordeal, and have held that grudge against them for like 11 years now!",

If OP wasn't in town and wanted the delivery company to move the item they delivered, then he should call, guess who, the delivery company. The delivery company made the mistake, not the HVAC company. HVAC could've been nicer about it, but OP was barking up the wrong tree.\n\nYou order something off Amazon (or Target, IBM, Apple, Acer, ____ insert any company name), many times it's not even Amazon delivery, but a company they hire to do deliveries. Example, FedEx, DHL, UPS, whatever. Delivery company puts your box in a puddle of mud and ruins the item inside. You take photo of said delivery and delivery company pays for it.

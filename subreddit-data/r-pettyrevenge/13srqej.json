    "postText": "I can now freely post this since I\u2019ve left my old job a few months back. \n\nMy boss was your typical asshole guy + one step further. He used to make me work 13 hour shifts without OT because \u201cI was paying my dues\u201d. Mind you I have a Masters Degree and I was practically working like an animal. \n\nWorst part was his screaming and throwing things at me. I\u2019ve had keyboards, mouse, wires, empty water bottled hurled at me and upper management said this (construction) is a tough field and I have to have thick skin to survive and be successful. I have cried multiple times in my two years at this job because it was so horrible. \n\nFor some additional context, my partner volunteers like crazy and receives free tickets to shows and concerts. For the two years I have worked there, my boss has timely asked for two tickets to be arranged for him and his wife. \n\nBefore I was leaving, my boss told me to arrange similar tickets for an upcoming show. I told him that my partner could get them only for the venue in another city so he\u2019d have to travel. He was fine with it because it was one of the classical things he loves. \n\nA few weeks later, I sent him the ticket. But edited the QR code and the ticket number just enough to make it invalid. The ticket also did not have his name on file (had my partners) so I hoped they wouldn\u2019t be able to pull up the right ticket. (Plus I was pretty sure he didn\u2019t know my partners full name to have the tickets pulled up)\n\nThe weekend of the show, I saw on his IG stories that he flew to the other city. I got a bunch of calls from him that evening (presumably because the tickets were  showing up as invalid) but I sat and watched TV and let my phone ring \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb\n\n\nTLDR: Made my asshole boss fly to another city for a show and gave him fake tickets.",

And of course, most women don\u2019t realistically stand a chance in a fist fight with a man.\n\nFawning occurs when someone is very nice, in spite of clear threat from a dangerous person. In this situation, the boss had thrown things at her (obviously, he had already escalated to violence, and whether she realized it or not, she had a good reason to be afraid of him), and also had the power to fire her, for no reason, likely leaving her in a bad situation. \n\nIt\u2019s very possible that OP, like many people, tolerated abuse at work because that is her \u201cnormal.\u201d People who have never been treated with respect tend to not know what it looks like, think abuse is \u201cnormal,\u201d don\u2019t know how to enforce boundaries, fear retaliation, and/or assume that they deserve to be treated like shit. This is, in my experience, particularly the case for women.\n\nI also understand why that looks extremely confusing, from the outside, especially to a man (most of whom are taught that they are justifiably permitted to react to violence with violence), or to a person who has never been subjected to this kind of treatment, long-term.",

It can certainly be informed by their gender, or their status as an immigrant and discrimination they've experienced on that basis, but it's rarely the whole story - and we can't know for sure without knowing the OP's history in intimate detail.

For me (50F) I spent years in every one of my jobs taking abuse and just quitting when I had had enough. But then I found a job I really liked and finally said something. I have been in jobs which are coed so both men and women and the misogyny amd se ual harrassment is real. For a while like 20 hears I put up with it. Would quit when it got too much. Then found a job I loved. Was assaulted by a man in the first 3 months but kept my mouth shut. Just stayed away from him and his buddies. Then 5 more years go by and one of his friends assaulted me at work. It caused me to have ptsd and I finally demanded this person be disciplined. This was far more scary than dealing with the nervous breakdown but my boss is amazing. I finally found a boss that wont tolerate any kind of gossip or harrassment. My work place is a safe place again. I am going on my 11th year. It can be hard for women to work in a male dominated environment but this is where the money is. You have to put up with a lot of misogynist comments.",

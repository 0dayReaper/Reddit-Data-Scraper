    "postText": "Near on a decade ago, I (NB, 20 at the time), attended a hospitality school. Just for extra knowledge as I had already done hospo for 3 years in various places.\n\nEvery class is run by students, including kitchen but you have lecturers who make sure operations run smoothly and each class will be mixed from students who are new to the those who are senior (learning management roles).\n\nOn certain mornings, I was in the coffee section\nFood is cheap, coffee is cheap and you\u2019d expect to deal with less Karen\u2019s\u2014but lemme tell you, you dealt with some of the worst of the worst when you got them. \n\nI loved the process of perfecting coffee. I hated people with ridiculous orders. \nWhy do you need half soy, half skim milk, Donna from Design? What is the purpose? And John from Marketing: 1/4 shot of decaf coffee? Really? Why?\n\nWell we have one old biddy (let\u2019s call her Ellen) who liked to come in with her friends, and would order a soy flat white, extra hot. \nSeems simple enough. Except Ellen would let it sit for 10 minutes, complain it\u2019s not hot enough and then demand a remake. \n\nI knew her well enough that I had tried to avoid remaking her coffees by making the cup as hot as possible. Didn\u2019t matter what I did, she sent it back. \n\nI told Ellen she shouldn\u2019t leave her coffee to sit for 10 minutes. She told me that her whole table got cold coffee, that it tasted dreadful and she\u2019d talk to my teacher about my coffee making skills and pour attitude.\nMy lecturer told me to just remake it. I argued that it doesn\u2019t matter how good the first one is, she always sends it back after not touching it. I don\u2019t make bad coffee-my lecturer knows this, the teaching chefs know this. I made sure I was perfect at it so I didn\u2019t have to smile at anyone\u2014balance ya know?\n\u201cJust remake the tables coffees\u201d\n\nI\u2019d had her cross me 3 times too many. I had dealt with her on floor long before I got switched to coffee and I had 20 minutes until my class was done. \n\nFuck Ellen. She can have this remake.\n\nAnd I remade it all right. I took that soy milk to hell, concealed the hideousness via a prefect foam appearance. I sat her cup under the steam wand, I put boiling water in the cup and made sure it was a hazard to touch before putting the coffee together. I still had 3 other coffees to remake after all.\n\nThe lecturer had put up with her for years, and I chose today to make sure Ellen knew she fucked up. \nHer friends coffee\u2019s were perfect. Ellen got satans asshole in a cup.\nI iced the handle on her cup and sent it. \n\nThe lecturer handled the delivery and I waited for the complaining.\n\nHer friends said their coffees were wonderful. Ellen yelled at my lecturer. My lecturer, docket in hand, ripped Ellen a new one\u2014backed my coffee skills too, while telling Ellen that bullying students wasn\u2019t going to be tolerated, that if she hates our coffee so bad, go somewhere that doesn\u2019t have students.\n\nI made myself a coffee and stood near the bar, watching Ellen not-so generous force herself to sit and finish her lunch with a bad coffee.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask for a remake in my other \u201cshifts\u201d and I made sure to deliver them personally.",

I hated this guy. He could never be bothered with a please or thank you and he always spoke to me as if I was dumb and didn\u2019t know his order even though I\u2019d make it so many times. He always got a chai latte, only \u201cone drop\u201d of milk, extra hot. I wish I\u2019d done this to him lmao.",

Told them to remake it the way she ordered it. \nAgain I laugh. And again they made it the way she ordered it. And again it was cold. She took a sip. I see it on her face the realization she fucked up.

Possible employers from hotels and catering companies often request the best students be put forward for temp work to see them in action, but employers from anywhere can also approach students while working in their practical class/ shift, providing they announce themselves to the lecturer.\nSome lecturers also go out of their way to reach out to their contacts and get jobs for students if they think they\u2019d be a good fit. \n\nWas handy to get an overall training, but a fair few of the students had no idea of the industry labour expectations and the lecturers rarely let it slip just how brutal it can be out here.\nRip to the kids who thought 1 x 4 hour prac class was super long to go without a break.",

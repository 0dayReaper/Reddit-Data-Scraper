    "postText": "I worked as technical support for a company in the tech industry. The job didn't pay super well, but I enjoyed my coworkers and the atmosphere of the company. One of the things which made the company great (for me) was that there was a culture of playing video games on lunch breaks, or during time scheduled by the CEO to do so. One game was a team shooter akin to Counter Strike. The CEO absolutely LOVED playing the game and didn't take well to losing (if he got sniped he would sometimes rage quit). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, all good things must come to an end I guess. The company wasn't doing good enough for the stakeholders and they \"had to\" let people go. I was one of those caught up in the layoffs. My manager was great and supported me and the others let go, and invited us to continue to play games with those who were left. I did once or twice because I missed the team. One of these games I was excited that the CEO was on the other team and I would get a chance to go against him and get some video game satisfaction. Except when I joined my team was down a lot, and he switched teams to my team to balance it out. Once he was in our voice channel he sounded really excited to see me, and asked how I was doing.   \n\n\n I team killed him, and then he left the game. \n\nPeople &gt; Profit",

Who cares about the lives turned upside down? And what consequences are there for those who actually made the mistakes that lead to the company performance being less than expected?

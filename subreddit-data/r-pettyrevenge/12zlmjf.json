    "postText": "\n\nHi,\n\nI had a boyfriend(M34) for 2 years and all of a sudden he ghosted me. I didn't see it coming, there was no reason. Sometimes I had the feeling he was not that serious about me. He assured me that he was serious about me. \n\nWhen he ghosted me I texted him, called him. No answer. Asked my stuff back, never a reply and never got my items back.\n\nI discovered a lot of things after he ghosted. He was active on datingapps during our whole relationship and met girls. Probably also had sex with some I think, and all that while we had unprotected sex!\n\nIt really fucked me up, I got depressed, thought I was ugly and lost all positivity. I really lost myself, never got any answers and I was ashamed of myself.\n\nOne day I made a fake profile on a datingapp. I matched with him and we set up a date. Obviously never showed up, because I was fake. Did it also a few times after that, maybe 6 times. Also never showed up, or said that he was ugly and that's why I didn't show up. One time he even already bought tickets for the movies.\n\nHe also lied to these women. Saying that he lived in another city. Saying that he had been single for a year and so on. It almost seemed like he was a pathological liar.\n\n I don't know. It was all a lie for him. I just wanted him to feel the same way I had/have been feeling. I have zero regrets doing it.",

The closest such advice ever came to that said: \u201cIf you\u2019re concerned about how he\u2019ll react to you ending your relationship, then it\u2019s best to make your announcement in the form of a note/letter. Depart while he\u2019s out (if he seldom leaves the house, a moonlit flit while he\u2019s asleep is the next best thing) and leave said note on your way out for him to discover upon his return; aim to be good and far away when he reads it.\u201d\n\nIOW: Breaking up by letter for your own safety is the way to go if doing things face-to-face might put you in danger. But there\u2019s no reason to completely ghost your (soon-to-be ex) partner, even when abuse is a factor. Even if he\u2019s such an arsehole that he really doesn\u2019t deserve the bare minimum level of courtesy, it\u2019d surely be therapeutic for the victim to reclaim some power by writing: \u201cYou\u2019re a dickhead and I\u2019m done with you; see you never.\u201d",

It places responsibility on them for being too selfish and immature to work on their trauma. Instead of internalizing it, like OP said, and allow it to undermine your confidence.\n\nOr you can become as bitter and ignorant as they are and spend the rest of your life choosing misery over growth, like them. Choosing compassion doesn\u2019t mean you have no boundaries or allow toxic people in your life, but it does mean you are choosing to end the cycle of hurt.

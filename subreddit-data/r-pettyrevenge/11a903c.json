    "postText": "This may be the most petty thing I have ever done in my life. I'm a pretty petty person, and I also believe in malicious compliance, but this takes the cake.\n\nSo I bought a condo in a building in a large city in the US about 2.5 years ago. The building has an HOA that we all pay into monthly. Since I've lived here, the building has rapidly deteriorated and we have all hired an attorney for a class action style lawsuit. I'm talking broken elevators, broken rooftop AC units, the pool was empty for four months during the summer, etc. The people in the building are great though, and we are a friendly bunch.\n\n  \nLast year, I took the HOA to Small Claims court because they failed to provide financial documents that show us how our fees are being spent. As this is a legal requirement for all HOAs in my state, I won the case and was awarded the $30 filing fee plus $1, symbolic (I sued for documents, not money). The fact that they can't provide the docs as they are legally required to do is a separate issue among others including possible criming that we've hired the attorneys for. I have asked the HOA to pay the $31 to me, and the president of the HOA wants to either meet me somewhere private to give it to me, or he wants to mail me a Satisfaction of Judgement form, have me sign it, and mail it back to him and then he will mail me a check. No to both!\n\n  \nThree days after I won the case, the HOA announced that they were going to charge us all a special assessment of about $1000 each and an increase in our monthly dues of 10%. In my state, a membership vote gets triggered if you charge a special assessment that brings the building more than 5% its yearly income, which means 51% of the owners must approve of the assessment for it to take effect.  As this $$$$ is about 20% of our yearly income, a vote should have taken place. When we asked about this vote, the HOA said that it was being made under an emergency clause, which means that the membership vote doesn't have to take place. The emergency? Fixing the elevator that broke on Dec 24, 2021. The spirit of the emergency clause is for things like fire, earthquake, flood, etc, not a broken elevator that has been broken for a year already.\n\n  \nWhen there was understandable pushback, the HOA sent out a little email stating that anyone who didn't pay the assessment would have a lien put on their unit. The liens came down yesterday to those that couldn't pay $1000 on short notice (our attorneys told us that even though the money is in dispute, we still have to pay it, and I did pay mine, but we also have a lot of retirees/lower income people in the building).\n\n  \nThe HOA president's house is currently on the market for $20m. I just got back from the courthouse where I filed a $31 lien against it for $140, clouding its title. It's a matter of principle, not money. Now the title can't change hands until he pays me my $31 and I am perfectly within my rights to collect on a judgement owed :)\n\nEDIT: I will for sure keep you guys updated after the attorneys do their thing. That might be a story for prorevenge tho.\n\nEDIT 2: Some confusion here. I initially filed the small claim with the HOA as defendant. The small claim judge determined that was incorrect and said I should sue the individual as the president of the HOA and made me amend the case, therefore, the defendant in the whole case was the one individual person, and therefore he is responsible for the $31 and I can exercise my right to put a lien on his home in my effort to collect. I CAN ONLY PUT A LIEN AGAINST THE DEFENDANT, AND THE DEFENDANT IS A PERSON. I CANNOT PUT A LIEN AGAINST THE HOA BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT THE DEFENDANT IN THE CASE. THE COURTS ALREADY DETERMINED THAT THE PERSON OWES ME MONEY. I DONT NEED TO CONTINUE TO ARGUE A CASE IVE ALREADY WON. \n\nEDIT 3: Wow this blew up, and with that so many ppl accusing me of lying because they don\u2019t understand our legal system. Thank you to all who are supporting my efforts, we hope to have these ppl overthrown and in prison hopefully by the end of the year. We\u2019ve turned over all we have to our attorneys who are the best HOA attorneys in LA. We will get these people! \nFurther reading on what else these slumlords are dealing with: https://globalpropertyinc.com/2022/08/10/lawsuit-barry-shy-didnt-disclose-defects-in-400m-deal/\n\nFinal edit I hope: If you live in Los Angeles county and have a money judgement against someone, learn how to collect here: https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/small-claims/after-trial/collect-money. If you scroll down and choose FROM THEIR PROPERTY, all you have to do is fill out the Abstract of Judgement, get it filed at the courthouse ($40), then get it recorded ($100) for a lien against a property to take effect.\n\nFinal final edit: Got this email this morning. https://imageshack.com/i/pnaXtKp2j Sorry my first link to it was bad.\n\nEdit 3/3: A YouTuber named Hellfreezer reached out and asked if he could do a reading. I said yes. Mine is story #2, listen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsnEcjxmNEo",

Yet the condo fees would rise.  The problem was that a developer retained enough of the units (2/3 in my state) to do anything they wanted without a vote.  Contacted a RE lawyer friend of mine and he told me I was wasting my time.\n\nThat said, I do like your level of petty.

I think all tenants get something like double or triple their HOA fees back in penalties if it's proven they've been misappropriated, which should be easily done with all the broken down mechanicals.\n\nBest wishes and many Blessings for a great big WIN for all of you!",

I found out I was not the only person he sold this one unit to, I was the one however that paid the most. It was my first purchase and I was not well versed in real estate law. After I apparently closed escrow ( which to find out I actually didn\u2019t close due to a lis pendent) I moved in and I was so excited. The next day I get  knock at my door  and this little loud man yells at me sticking his hand out saying \u201c you owe me rent\u201d. I was confused and angry. He then yelled some rediculous amount for me to pay. I\u2019m not a believer in free rides and told this man I would not pay what he is asking for, but I will pay the fair market rate ( which I new for sone reason) and nothing more until this works itself out. I do thankful I did pay the rent as it would come up later in court that I was honest and just wanted what I bought. If you didn\u2019t figure out already, this loud little man was Barry Shy. Basically I allowed my world to turn upside  down and affect me mentally and physically. The uncertainty of housing fucked with my head. I hired an attorney and off to court we went. While BS lied through his teeth about almost everything it never made sense and the judge saw right through him. I did some research while this whole mess was in litigation and found that BS was currently involved in 90 something lawsuits. It\u2019s now circa 2007 and still in litigation mostly due to the frivolous delays by him. The market was really taking off and the loft I was suing for had almost doubled in price since I thought I bought it. Everything came out in court and not only was he found guilty but was also liable for punitive damages due to what I went thru. It was looking like a blank check of what did I want. After a couple days and some great advice I realized that he would NEVER settle on something he basically lost and I could continue litigation to get what\u2019s rightfully mine. But he has the money to out run me in the long haul. I needed to choose between saving my mental and physical self and move on or continue the fight until I could no longer. Obviously I chose to settle and we did. The amount wasn\u2019t near what it should have been but I was going to get my life back. So literally the week after I receive the settlement money the fucking crash of the market took place and overnight the loft went from a 100% price increase to  \u2153 decrease if the original price I paid. Basically what was once ( on paper ) 800-850k had dropped to 225k AND IT WASNT MY PROBLEM. I moved out, rented a place for a minute then bought a house in the hollywood hills. I\u2019m so grateful.",

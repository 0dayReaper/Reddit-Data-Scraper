    "postText": "Reposted here, guess it didn't meet the guidelines for prorevenge.\n\nAlright so I (28F) used to work as a custodian at a fitness center with this dude (43M), let's call him Moby. Sorry for the long post, I've been steamed about this for years and wanted to get it all off my chest.\n\nMoby had beef with pretty much everyone, not just those on the cleaning crew; his main thing was going to complain to supervisors about coworkers, but most of these claims were inflated and exaggerated. At first I had no idea he would do this at all; every day Moby would go out of his way to be friendly to me, strike up conversations, compliment my baking when I'd bring in treats, and was generally a pleasant guy if a bit too friendly. He tended to bring up the subject of dating a lot and how tough it was for him (he was balding, morbidly obese, lived with his mother, didn't have much in the way of money) and I (along with a few others) got the vibe he wasn't too happy to hear I was seeing someone. Still, he never crossed a line and I thought we were cool.\n\nAfter a few months where my shift changed and I came back to work my usual hours with him, Moby had done a complete 180. He essentially gave me the cold shoulder and he seemed to be avoiding me. I figured maybe something happened while I was gone and he was having a rough time, except he was still acting normally with everyone else at our job. I brush it off and go about work; we get a new supervisor. About three months later I'm talking to my other coworker; let's call him Dave. Dave works the exact same shift as us and we're talking about Moby; I don't like to pry but his cold shoulder behavior is making it hard to work with him. I ask Dave if something happened while I was away or if I said something to offend Moby without realizing.\n\nWell, as it turns out, Dave tells me that he, a few select coworkers, and most of our higher ups have heard from Moby that I'm a lazy good for nothing who takes two hour breaks at a time and he has to do most of the cleaning. He also demanded I be fired, multiple times. From the first day our new supervisor had set foot in the center he had been telling him lies. Dave thought I knew already; Moby was even telling lies to the people who come to work out, literally gossiping about me to patrons for months and basically trying to turn everyone there against me and urging them to make complaints themselves. My jaw drops: not only is none of this true, but I was the one who had to pick up the slack for Moby and was even asked to clean areas he was supposed to because he wasn't doing HIS job (I found this out later and would have refused if I'd known I was taking on extra responsibilities; the general consensus is they should have fired him years ago.)\n\nNot long after this, I talk to my supervisor; he says Moby has in fact been talking to him and gave him an ultimatum: either I go or he does. My supervisor is getting sick of it and flat out says there's no way he would choose Moby over me and in the few months he's been here I've basically proven myself to be the best employee there. I mention everything else Dave has told me. Eventually, Moby gets called into a meeting about his conducts and gets written up. To this day I don't know why he was gunning for me to be fired: Dave thinks he was mad I had gotten engaged and being recognized for my work, but I don't know for sure. I just knew I wasn't satisfied with the outcome; I know I could have let it go and turn the other cheek but I felt so hurt and betrayed, I wanted to pay him back with more than a little reprimanding from our boss.\n\nFollowing the meeting, I end up having to take multiple shifts that week: it's worth mentioning at this point I'm acquainted with pretty much everyone and to toot my own horn a bit, they all have a generally positive opinion of me (custodians, trainers, front desk, even people who work in the pool and building maintenance etc. and the higher ups to boot) or at least appreciate my work ethic, that I'm always willing to lend a hand or an ear, and share my baking hobby. I say this because the rest of the week when I chit chat with my coworkers, I end up bringing up the whole fiasco with Moby. Keep in mind, he's already made some enemy's but this is the final straw. Word gets around and most of our coworkers are shocked and appalled he would go so far to make me out like a lazy bum and get me fired. By the end of the month Moby has essentially become a pariah in part because he's still talking sh*t about me (but not to the patrons or managers anymore) and no one is having it. I hear about Moby getting shut down, chewed out, and told to shut up on my behalf. So, I basically do the exact thing Moby was trying to do to me, though to be fair, most of it he did to himself anyway.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention he tries to get back into my good graces, likely so everyone will stop being mad at him, but I just ice him out too the exact way he did to me. After I left he did get fired but it didn't have anything to do with me. I'm guessing enough people had enough of his crap and they decided to either stop covering for him or he got someone else angry enough to earn another strike on his conduct.\n\nTLDR: possible r/niceguy coworker suddenly starts ignoring me, turns out he's been spreading lies to get me fired and tells other staff and patrons I'm a horrible employee when I've been unknowingly covering for his incompetence. He gets written up and through me telling everyone what he did and his continued efforts to ruin my reputation, he ends up disliked by everyone.",

What she did not bank on was that I had been there 3 years before she got there, and every single person in the building knew me, my work ethic, my personality, and that I don't play dirty. She also did not bank on me calling HR as I left to report her for her latest garbage behavior, circling back to HR after I got my baby from the sitter and my husband from the house, and had a meeting with HR, our boss, and the director of security. I related the incident and things leading up to it, and was told to go home and write my statement. I left, collected my other kids, and went home. Within a minute of closing my door, there was a CPS worker knocking. I greeted her with \"let me guess, you got a call at approximately 2:05 pm, from a woman saying *x allegations*.\" Yeah, I included that bit in the statement. I know she called CPS from the office phone as a measure of plausible deniability.  She forgot the employer could trace the call to her extension. I don't know what repercussions she faced, but she was incredibly silent the rest of the time I worked there. For years after I left, anytime I popped in to visit my sister there in another department, I had multiple people ask if I was going to come back.",

She would even put parts together wrong every time I trained her to try to make me look like I didn't know what I was doing. It took a year but me sitting out with everyone on breaks so she couldn't bad mouth me finally got to her and she swapped shifts.

    "postText": "So, at my local off lead dog park, we have a little bit of a community there. Same people most nights taking their dogs out for a walk, we all know each other and look forward to seeing one another after work. \n\nOne lady, who we see occasionally is a vile thing. She will intentionally walk towards the dogs and scream \u2019put your dog on a lead!\u2019 And kick and thrash at the dogs. About 6 months ago, my friend was walking both her elderly dogs through the park alone, she was approached by this vile lady, spat at and racially abused. My friend was shocked and extremely upset by this and had to be consoled. \n\nThis afternoon I was walking through the park with my two dogs. I have the week off work and the weather not great, so not a soul in sight, until halfway through the park vile lady walks toward us.  My lovely terrier wanders up to say hello, and vile lady starts screaming, kicking and thrashing her shopping bag at my dog \u2018get away from me\u2019 my dog pauses to evaluate and starts rounding the lady barking (she thinks it\u2019s and game). My other terrier, not wanting to miss out on the fun, runs towards them and joins in with the chasing and barking. I turned my back and walked away, listening to the terrified screams.\n\nFor all the Karen\u2019s and Darren\u2019s commenting below, my dogs were beside me literally seconds after I walked alway. They were not at any point in any danger, nor was the woman they were barking at.",

It finally got to the point the dog bit him properly, but was still acting like it was a game. He pulled his bleeding leg away from the dog and kinda squared up, thinking he might have to fight this dog. His reaction made the dog realize the fight was on as well. Luckily a neighbor (not the dog's owner, but familiar with the dog) nearby called the dog off and there were no further injuries. \n\nIt can turn very quickly from a game to not a game, and even in an off leash area you're going to be liable if a person gets injured interacting with your dog, no matter how dumb the person is being. And bitey dogs are often dead dogs when the law gets involved.",

I informed him that if he didn't like dogs, he probably shouldn't have camped his ass on the doggy beach.\n\nSome incoherent yodeling followed, the gist of it being \"This isn't a dog beach you idiot\". I just shrugged, and walked off with doggo. Turned around after a little while, and saw moron was packing up his stuff. I guess his two braincells finally shook hands.",

Personally, I would never walk away from my dog. In 10 years that I\u2019ve had my husky, the thought to walk away while he barks at someone has never crossed my mind. Regardless if it\u2019s some ass holes fault. My pets safety will come first. If I have to file a police report on this person I will, but I\u2019m not going to walk away while my dogs give her an earful. Mind you, my husky has never bitten anyone, he\u2019s a big baby.",

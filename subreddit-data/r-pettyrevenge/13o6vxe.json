    "postText": "So, I(24M) live in a megacity in India. I have noticed that through the past 7 years, the Traffic situation in the city is worsening by the day, with new vehicles being added to the flow all the time, and migrants from different parts of the country moving into the city. Which is fine of course. The only problem is - People in my City do not understand the basic rules of 'Headlights' of their vehicles. Now, I am a nightowl who is generally awake and outside till like 2 AM at least, everyday. The problem here is, post 7 PM you can notice how at least 50% of fellow commuters have kept their headlights on 'HighBeam' mode, commonly known as 'Upper' in my city. \nNow, this city has very narrow streets and in some parts there are no streetlights to steer clear on the road. When I am driving on such narrow streets, and the vehicle crossing mine on the opposite direction, if they have their headlights on High Beam, I can not see the road clear and it is very easy to miss any - Potholes, Speedbreakers,Stray Animals, or even a passerby. It's a safety hazard and I am much more prone to accidents when this happenes.\n\nI have tried to spread awareness about this through various networks but it seems that ignorance and negligence gets the better of my city people. So I decided to treat it with Tit for Tat technique. \n\nI got my two-wheeler installed with highest allowed capacity headlamps, which has the capacity somewhat similar to newer LED Headlight Cars. Of course I usually drive with headlights on Low Beam mode (tested by us friends that it's not really 'blinding' when on Low Beam mode) but whenever I see somebody in the opposite lane, driving with High Beam, I put mine on high beam as well. It's really petty of me to thing 'Ok B I T C H, both of us will suffer the same pain now' but I just can't help it! \n\nNotes-\n\n- I would have loved getting 'Yellow Tinted Glasses' which protect against such blinding lights during night, but I can't because I have power glasses already, without which I just can't drive at all.\n- I would never shine high beam lights when I can see that there are multiple vehicles across the street and at least one of them is driving with low beam, why hurt somebody who's really done nothing.\n- However, whenever in such a situation, I first flip the lights from low to high and then to low beam, a couple of times, to signal for them to lower theirs, sometimes they do and sometimes they don't, and when they don't, I make sure they will be safe, and then give them the taste of their own medicine.",

The road was unlit and was crowded by cars, trucks, buses, mopeds, bikes and walking people, all at different speed, the slow traffic mostly without any light at the side of the road, and the cars, trucks and buses with high bean light at high speed at the center of the road.\n\nOP, I feel your pain. I am glad that in Europe, the use of high beam lights is much more considerate.",

This is unsafe and more annoying as the other car would get blinded with the sudden flash. I told him off every time, and he just shrug it off each time. One day we bought a huge super bright LED torch light for work. The whole day I carried it around and would flashed it straight to his face everytime we walked passed each other. I even flashed his face on and off while were sitting down for a discussion. He told me to stop, eventually started cursing and got mad. I kept a straight face and shrugged. He was aware why I did that, but didnt say anything of course. He did eventually stop with his highbeam habit.",

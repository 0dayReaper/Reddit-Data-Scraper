    "postText": "This is not me (yet), but I'm enjoying my popcorn.\n\nTwo years ago, my SIL had a destination childfree wedding that a lot of people on both sides resented because it was an expensive hassle for everybody to come and get over-night babysitters etc, and she invited two particular kids to be in the wedding while banning the rest. It did not effect me, having no kids. But there was major hurt, major drama, major bridezilla vibes in all the handling of it. At every turn she was very un-gracious to all of her guests, doubling down throughout on the \"it's MY DAY\" rationale for putting a whole slew of unecessary burdens on guests and wedding party members. But it was really the 'childfree' part was pretty hard on all the family coming long-distance; some just didn't come at all, and others hired sitters for the evenings away but it left a lot of bad blood.\n\nSince then, my brother and SIL have since now had twins, but she has voiced some complaints to me because *her* brother has apparently hosted a childfree Christmas, childfree Easter, childfree Memorial Day cook-out this weekend for the wider family where it is only his own kids allowed... It sounds like he is giving her a taste of her own medicine with the \"i'm the host, and i'll invite who I want\" and \"if I dont' want to deal with your kids, I don't have to\" treatment. This is actually on her side of the family and not on ours, so I am just nodding and saying vague things like \"oh, i see\" -- but I have to say, I am kind of impressed by his commitment to petty revenge. How long will they do everything 'childfree' on her? (Though in the big picture I hope something shifts so he is not still doing this when the kids get old enough to be cognizant; right now they are &lt;yr old). At any rate, SIL is wounded that her family is expecting her to pay a sitter for the babies  -- *ooooh the irony.*\n\nSo now functionally, SIL and B and babies have started opting for more of our family's stuff since we are indeed welcoming their babies and have so far refrained from pettily pulling the 'childfree' thing in return on her when we host. Despite all the nastiness of their wedding, I actually do want to get to know my brother's kids, and it is not their fault their mother was a mean-girl bridezilla. BUT me and my parents do allow my dog, and since the babies' birth she has started making comments at OUR events hinting that it would be easier if she didn't have to worry about the (calm and utterly un-interested golden retriever) dog around the babies. To her credit, she has not yet tried to dictate family events as 'dogfree' but I am on orange alert and have my counter-offensive plan ready. You can bet if she does try to institute 'dog free' on us, then I will take a page out of her brother's book and explain sure my hosting would need to be both 'dogfree' and 'childfree.'\n\nWe can all play these petty hosting games if necessary, i guess, lol.",

            "comment": "When my wife and I decided to get married, I was in the navy stationed in Norfolk VA, and she had recently moved here. My family asked if we would be getting married in PA where I'm from, while my fiances family asked her about getting married in SD, where she's from. We got married in Norfolk, and had everyone come here.\n\nThe wedding was planned for the beginning of December 2004. We were in our mid-30's, so we weren't super young and just starting out, and thus arranged and paid for everything ourselves, ceremony and reception wise. I was on a shore duty rotation, so I had plenty of time and a regular work schedule, versus sea-duty rotation, where nothing is \"regular\" and planning anything is nearly impossible. The only wrinkle in everything, which was a great wrinkle to have, WA that I was selected for advancement to Chief Petty Officer that September, which meant that I would be going through Chiefs Initiation. While Chiefs Initiation was a bit watered down, from what it used to be before the Tailhook '91 scandal, and the navy becoming a kinder, gentler institution, there were still a few \"Animal House\" like moments, where we were expected to drop everything and participate in the games. We got through all that just fine, and the planning went on. Everything went so fine, in fact, that I had an opportunity to travel up to Boston, and live aboard USS Constitution for a week, and ride the ship for one of its turn-around events, and I went.\n\nWhile I was driving up to Boston, my future SIL - she can be \"Becky\" for this story, decided to stir up a bit of drama. My wife has a twin brother, and Becky was his (now ex) wife. They accepted their invitation to the wedding, and their small children were going to participate as ring bearer and flower girl in the ceremony. Anyway, Becky calls and says, \"I'm sorry, we won't actually be able to attend you wedding. The finances aren't going to work out for us.\" What a load of crap. My wife has a younger sister who may have had to budget a little for the travel &amp; lodging, but the rest of the family, on both sides, was good to afford it.\n\nOf course, I had met Becky, on the trip to SD, when I met the rest of her family. Becky was a bit \"off,\" but I didn't exactly understand what her deal was, at the time.\n\nApparently, Becky didn't want to spend their money on the travel and lodging. She figured that my wife, upon hearing that Becky's family couldn't afford to go, would arrange for my FIL to pay for their travel. My wife did not. My wife said, \"I'm really sorry you guys won't be there. I was really hoping you could make it.\" Becky suddenly had to go.\n\nMy wife called me, and told me about her phone conversation. She said that based on her response to Becky, the shit would be hitting the fan at any moment now. Becky did not disappoint. The wife had to let me go, because Becky was calling. Becky said, \"Oh no! I just realized that my kids are the flower girl and ring bearer! If we're not going to be there, what are you guys going to do?\" My wife said, \"It's no problem Becky. When you had to go a little while ago, I called (my wife's best friend) Michelle, and her kids will be the flower girl and ring bearer now.\" Becky stammered, \"Oh, well, I guess you got it taken care of. While I'll let you get back to it, bye.\" My wife called me again, laughing. She said that things were about to get intense. She said her brother would be calling any......\"I gotta go. My brother is trying to call me.\"\n\nMy BIL assured her that they would be attending our wedding, and that their kids would be participating. The conversation went well, all the way to the part where BIL says, \"You guys won't need Michelle's kids to be in the wedding after all.\" My wife said, \"I already arranged it with Michelle. I'm not going to tell her that her kids are now redundant, and not needed! We'll just let all 4 kids do it.\" Now my wife and her brother were arguing. My wife considers Michelle family. They grew up together in a town of less than 200 people, went to school and some college together, and are still best friends today. My BIL seems to have some sort of resentment towards Michelle. \n\nMichelle does seem to have good luck with anything she does, but a lot of it is personality. My BIL is definitely a \"glass half empty\" guy, while Michelle is a \"my glass is so full, you can really see elasticity of the water about to burst over the rim of the glass\" kind of woman.\n\nWell, my BIL hangs up. A minute later, my MIL calls. She's mad, but only because my BIL is at her house \"losing his shit.\" My MIL just called the wife, to figure WTF was going on. The reality is that my BIL doesn't actually condone what Becky said or did, but feels like no matter what, he must be the best team player for his wife.\n\nAnyway, arguments went on for several days. The important thing is that everyone attended. We had 2 ring bearers, and 2 flower girls. \n\nIIRC, Becky did manage to get my FIL to pay for their lodging, but im not positive in that. At the reception, Becky got into an argument with my FIL, demanding to know how much everything cost. My FIL told her that we paid for everything ourselves. She didn't believe him, stomped out of the reception, and wandered around downtown Norfolk by herself, until her tantrum was over.\n\nThe next day, we had a gathering and dinner at our house, and noticed that Becky wasn't there. My BIL had finally had enough of her, and left her at the hotel by herself. My family had it's share of drama, but it was certainly less entertaining than \"The Becky Show.\"\n\nFamily....you can't live with them. You have to live several states away.",

The youngest of my siblings had a destination wedding in an expensive area out of the country three weeks after rules changed to require passports (as we know there was a ton of advance notice).  Then she wanted the bridesmaids in really cute strapless dresses that went (maybe) to mid-thigh.  You know the kind: gorgeous on cute twenty- something\u2019s, not so cute on forty something moms (barring that exception we all know and \u201chate\u201d).\n\nThe capper was that she wanted kids at the ceremony, but not at the reception, requiring all the costs of passports and travel with the additional burden of finding a safe babysitter in another country/tourist destination. \n\nIn our case, it didn\u2019t cause long term anamosity as we knew that she was simply clueless.  But it did make the decision to not go really easy.  Apparently to all the siblings.  We never heard a peep",

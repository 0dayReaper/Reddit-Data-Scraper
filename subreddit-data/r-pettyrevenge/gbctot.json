    "postText": "When I was 13, so eight years ago, my dad remarried, after divorcing my mom 4 years before. Before the divorce, his fianc\u00e9e had been his mistress. My mom is completely better off without him, and ignoring the fact that I wouldn\u2019t exist, I don\u2019t think she should have married him in the first place. Even if I think my parents weren\u2019t a good match, that\u2019s no excuse to cheat on your wife. \n\nThis woman was fucking vile in all sorts of ways. She constantly belittled me, made fun of the fact I needed to take pills for my mental illness (despite being a fucking pharmacist? I don\u2019t get it either) and was generally awful to me and my siblings. But she was a decade younger than my dad and reasonably hot, so he didn\u2019t give a shit how she treated us. The one time he actually listened to us about her is when they were thinking of having a baby and my brother said he\u2019d ask our mom to sue for full custody of us if they did. \n\nSo anyway, they got married. I was a bridesmaid, cause that bitch had no real friends. (The other two bridesmaids were her sister and my sister.) My brother was the best man, cause she didn\u2019t like my dad\u2019s best friend. He and my dad still don\u2019t talk to this day, even though the guy was like an uncle to me as a little kid. It was a wedding, everything went normally.\n\nBut at the beginning of the reception, before the first dance, we were taking pictures in front of a chocolate fountain, looking like the happy family we never were and would never be. I\u2019m on the autism spectrum, and have a problem maintaining eye contact. This extends to looking at a camera. So when we had to retake a photo because I wasn\u2019t looking, she leans down and whispers something in my ear. I\u2019m not going to repeat it, but it involved the r-word. I don\u2019t like saying it. \n\nAnyway, I kinda snapped, and decided she was gonna pay for this. No one noticed (or at least no one called me out) when I started slowly moving the chocolate fountain towards the edge of the table. When it got to the edge, it makes contact with the back of that pure white wedding dress and slowly drips down. By the time she notices, it looks like she\u2019s shit herself. But for all anyone else knows this was an accident. She has no spare dress, and that stain is not coming out. So first dance, cutting the cake, speeches, everything, this woman has what looks like a shit stain on the back of her dress. \n\nIt was a small revenge, but it was so worth it. What\u2019s supposed to be the happiest day of this stupid woman\u2019s life, and she\u2019s gonna remember that stain, every time she thinks about it. They never did get the stain out. And nobody knew it was me. Until now, I guess. Hi family, if you\u2019re reading this. Suzie, you\u2019re a cunt and you deserved that chocolate stain.",

First, he texted me and my sister in a group chat between dad, sister and me, with just a photo of rings and champagne to \u201dannounce\u201d his engagement to his mistress he divorced our mom for. Didn\u2019t bother to even call.\n\nA month later, he announced (probably even called this time) that they would get married in less than two weeks, in the middle of a Friday=workday, and expected us to be there. I happened to be on vacation, but my sister was working that day (for our mom\u2019s office, no less) and my now-husband had a night shift that night. Dad got a shitty attitude about the fact that if my sister has to get a cab to make it in time, he has to pay for it, he just expected a 17-year-old to drop her job at short notice and pay for an expensive cab ride to be somewhere she reeeally doesn\u2019t even want to be. The wedding itself was surprisingly ok-ish, with just their kids and kids\u2019 spouses, and they called from the restaurant \u201dreception\u201d to tell their parents they got married. As said, my now-husband had a night shift and had to leave the reception early to go to work, but that apparently wasn\u2019t a reasonable excuse to not drink with my dad. Now-husband worked in security and could have been fired due to zero tolerance policies.\n\nI ended up escaping when bf left, and met up with a friend to take a train to the countryside to run away from all of it for the weekend. Shout out to that friend, she had poured a full bottle of wine into a sports drink bottle so I could get hammered on the train and drown my sorrows without conductors noticing the forbidden alcohol. A true and classy friend indeed.\n\nA few years later, when I got engaged, I called everyone else. Dad got a ring picture the group chat.",

I'm proud of you for getting through this as strong as you have. I have a good friend who is autistic, and would be very offended if someone made fun of him for that. He's smart, and like a big brother to me. (We're the same age.)",

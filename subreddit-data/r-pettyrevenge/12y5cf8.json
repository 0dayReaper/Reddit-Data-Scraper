    "postText": "My brother had an English teacher in 11th grade that hated him.   To the point he dropped out of high school and did night classes for his GED.   \n\nHe went on to own a construction company and the second largest custom cabinet shop in VA. \n\nA few years ago he saw the car she drove wile teaching at a 7-11 and realized she was inside the store.  He pulled his diesel pickup into the spot next to her leaving about 3 inches between them.   Her car was filled as though she was a hoarder leaving no way for her to climb in the passenger side. \n\nHe went in and got lunch and when she came out and asked him to move he told her nope.   He sat there for 45 minutes while she got madder and madder.",

I also sort of don\u2019t believe that even if she was a hoarder, she preferred to wait 45 minutes and wouldn\u2019t just open the door of the passenger side, move stuff around so she could climb in, then drive away",

I think most would not move stuff especially the amount they'd need to get in the passenger side. I'm no expert but it sounds legit to me. I remember trying to convince my mom to let me throw out menus for a Chinese food restaurant. I had found 14 of them in a room I was trying to help clean and she wanted to keep them all \"in case she needed them.\" There is not a lot of logic to it.\n\nEDIT: clarified whose menus they were",

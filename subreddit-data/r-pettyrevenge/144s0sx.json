    "postText": "I am from India. We have multiple modes of public transport. But along with your regular Uber, taxi, buses, trains and others we also have rickshaws or auto rickshaw as we call them. Rickshaws are three wheeler taxi services. They are supposed to be cheaper than taxi but most of these guys are very probmatic to deal with. Here is how it goes, you flag them down, tell them your destination and they will simply refuse. Or will refuse to go by the meter and quote a high amount of money. Either way, it's a pain to deal with.\n\nThere is a rickshaw stand outside my house. Today I asked one of them if he would go to my destination, a place called Andheri. He agreed, i get inside the rick and he suddenly announced i won't go to the Andheri, i said why not, he replied \" i don't want to go, I don't want to deal with traffic. \n\nI got pissed off, i was in a hurry to get to work. Luckily there was another rickshaw right behind. I got in that one. Just then a couple came along asking for a ride to the mall. The first guy who refused me said yes to them. But before they could accept it, i said \"Hey i am off to the same place, let's split the cost\". The couple happily agreed. They got in with me. They paid me their share which i handed off to the rickshaw driver and i paid the driver my full amount as well.\n\nThe second guy earned money from two fares for the cost of one and the first guy lost both. For a long time rickshaw drivers have been being complete jerks to us. I guess now they will see we can be petty too.",

I explained that I had a lot of luggage, which would be a PITA to carry, they insisted I go to the taxi stand on the south side of the building.\n\nWhen I got to the taxi stand, I made a beeline to the third cab in line (fist 2 were company A). Driver was surprised, drivers of first 2 cabs were mad. Once I was in my chosen cab, I explained to the driver. He understood why I didn\u2019t want to do business with company A. From that time on, I always called company B when I needed a cab.",

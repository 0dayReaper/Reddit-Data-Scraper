    "postText": "My dad has been abusive pretty much my whole life, but especially since I turned 16. He\u2019s routinely threatened to kick me out, dragged me out by my neck, and other stuff I don\u2019t really want to get into. He\u2019d also have random shouting fits towards me about things that aren\u2019t really that important.\n\nAfter all this wearing me out and causing me trauma, I\u2019ve learned to not listen to the things he\u2019s saying. I\u2019ll just immediately leave, and block out the sound somehow, by finding my headphones and blasting music, or covering my ears if they\u2019re not available. I don\u2019t listen to a thing he says, or take anything remotely seriously\n\nThis morning, I was in the bathroom. I was just peeing when my dad knocks and impatiently tries to open the door. Him saying that he needed the bathroom turned into him yelling at me and he said \u201cI\u2019m going to shit myself.\u201d I ignore him, cover my ears, and tell him if he\u2019s going to yell at me it\u2019s going to take longer. He keeps shouting. So I ignore him, say \u201cthanks, guess I\u2019m taking a shower now\u201d and I get in the shower and shave my legs\n\nI come back later and there\u2019s a bucket full of human shit in the bathroom. Obviously disgusting. But I hope it humbled him.",

Those types of people do not understand what they are doing wrong and the only thing you can do is remove yourself from that environment. I am sorry this is happening to you but also glad you got your little petty revenge.\n\nSo remember, try and work on getting out of that toxic environment and forget about those that are abusive to you. Wish you all the best.",

I'm dead serious. \n\nAbusers hate their victims escaping from them and many MANY time close to the leave date they attempt to sabotage the victim's escape.\n\nAgreed with u/gotty2018's suggestion that you start gathering your important documents together. If your parents try to withhold your documents (id, birth cert, passport) you can get copies of them and your passport can be stolen. (From my understanding the passport is actually property of that country's gov't but abusive parents hope you don't know that. Withholding a legal adult's passport can be illegal in some places.)\n\nSeriously.. pick your battles very carefully. I know it's easy to, and it's also normal to, want to fight back or even get petty revenge. It's natural to want justice and being abused it's common to feel like the whole war has already been lost so you find battles to win. I get that. Just let a lot of stuff go with him. Do not give indication that you're *leaving* leaving because he'll very likely try to sabotage you leaving even if he thinks you're coming back for the holidays.\n\nBe well and god speed.",

It can grow large enough to eat away the hearing bones and the mastoid which separates your inner ear from your brain. Untreated, it can cause paralysis or death; in my case, a bunch of surgeries and a prosthetic to replace the lost incus, malleus and stapes, and a visit to the ENT every 5 months to make sure the mastoid cavity is clear. Good times.",

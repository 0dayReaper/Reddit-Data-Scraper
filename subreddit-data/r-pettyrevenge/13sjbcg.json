    "postText": "So this happened way back in college. Facebook was brand new and all the rage. My roomate had this girlfriend that lived down the hall. I didn't like her much but whatever, I was always polite.\n\nShe was a little sketchy, so when she asked to take their relationship status off Facebook it was extremely suspicious. It didn't sit well with my roomate either. I offered to take care of it for him.\n\nAt the time I had a large number of friends that were girls. I went around and asked them all to do me a solid. Within about 3 hours his wall had like 30 messages on it. \"OMG what happened?! We should hang out!\" \"Hey, what are you doing this weekend?\" \"About time! Wanna go get dinner?\"\n\nShe was furious and put their relationship back up by that evening.",

I'm about 2/3 through main campaign rn and really enjoying it though I don't suggest starting on the hardest difficulty with permadeath until you learn all the mechanical nuances first",

But after enough utter bullshit we eventually just started a save and started save scumming when necessary. \n\nThere's lots of little things that are either complete bs rng, something the game gives no indication of how it will work exactly which completely changes everything, or a straight up glitch, which often means your entire squad is wiped or run is fucked.\n\nOnce we accepted save scumming is out of genuine necessity it became so much more fun but was still challenging and stressful",

When I wanted to remove my relationship status from my FB, because I was spiraling and anxious about the painful prospect of having to do that if we ever broke up, my then-boyfriend also took it poorly until we spoke about it at length. In retrospect I probably was acting sketchy because I didn\u2019t want to get into the details of the break-up that made me pre-worry about this outcome, and I didn't want him to think that I wanted to break up.\n\n&gt;...not lie about it then change her mind and put her safety at \u2018risk\u2019 over it\n\nI think you have my comment confused with the one I replied to. I didn't bring safety into this. I just agreed that there are good reasons to want to remove a FB relationship status, and that the post didn't make it clear that this girl was definitely a cheater or lying about anything. \n\nAll the OP said in the post was that he didn't like the girlfriend and she was being a little sketchy. Those are his opinions of her and her behaviour, and they may be warranted, but he didn't tell us what reason she gave (if any) for wanting to remove the status, or why she deserved to be fucked with.",

Even if she was just enjoying attention from other dudes without wanting to actually cheat, it's not a great look",

    "postText": "\nThis was originally posted in r/MaliciousCompliance. A few comments told me that this was maybe more r/PettyRevenge so I also decided to add here. I do hope it also fits here and hope it makes your day a little better. \n\nThis takes place in the Czech Republic where many people are often really grumpy.\n\nMy gf (30) and I (M21) were waiting for a bus ride to go to her hometown for a wedding. As you\u2019d expect we had three bags and they were packed to the point where zipping the bag required you to sit on it; especially her bag as she was one of the bridesmaids. \n\nBefore we boarded the bus we had to wait for the passengers who had paid beforehand to reserve seats (my gf and I had not prepaid). We were in somewhat of a line which allowed for the passengers who reserved seats to pass. The line for unreserved seat passengers was essentially respected\u2026except by this woman. She arrived when the line was somewhat being formed and decided to stand next to us. As our turn to board was coming up she quickly scooted in front of my gf and looked forward as if she was completely oblivious to the fact she had done something that was traditionally frowned upon. My gf was obviously quite annoyed and started saying out loud (in English, much of the older generation in this country doesn\u2019t understand English very well), \u201cWell that\u2019s a bitchy thing to do. Can you believe this woman?\u201d I was calm as I had counted how many people had already boarded the bus and there was still a good chance we\u2019d find seats together in the unreserved rows, so I didn\u2019t think it called for any type of confrontation. Still, I had calmly responded, \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, we can\u2019t be surprised when bitches do bitchy things.\u201d Looking back it was unnecessary but I was also tired and the bags were heavy so I was a bit impatient.\n\nWe finally sit down and my gf chose to sit in the two free seats behind her (I would\u2019ve chosen the seats in front of her and then just slowly reclined my seat back every few min so that she wouldn\u2019t have noticed my little act of revenge, but this ended up being better). It\u2019s important to note that the row the woman chose was the last row with an overhead shelf for bags. The shelf was a little longer in the front so every person essentially had space for their bag if they moved their bags a little towards the front of the bus. It\u2019s also important to mention that the shelf was essentially empty and I could\u2019ve placed another 5 bags next to ours if I wanted to.\n\nWe finally hit the road and the woman is talking on the phone (loudly I might add) saying how she\u2019s going to visit her grandson who is so sweet but that he plays metal music in his room and she can\u2019t stand the sound of it. After she finishes the call she takes off her windbreaker and plans to put it above her seat. She finally sees that my bag is directly above her seat and instead of moving her jacket 35 cm to the right on the shelf or setting her jacket on the empty seat beside her, she decides to confront me in an entitled tone, \u201cExcuse me young man, but I can\u2019t put my jacket anywhere because your fat bag is in the way!\u201d I was bored so decided to act like this was a tragedy, \u201cOh no! What will we do? Maybe if we put our heads together we can find a solution.\u201d Her face turned from shock to old communist grandma rage.\n\nShe yelled back, \u201cWell don\u2019t you know that the shelf space is for the person directly below the seat!?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry. I truly didn\u2019t know that was like an unspoken rule. So the space above your seat is only for you and the potential passenger next to you?\u201d I say truly acting sorry and embarrassed.\n\n\u201cYes, yes it is. So please move it you your spot,\u201d she says acting victorious.\n\n\u201cOf course. Right away.\u201d I quickly get up and take my gf\u2019s bag off the shelf and place it on the seat where I was sitting next to her. I keep my bag in the exact same spot and plop myself right next to old woman with a grin. The look on her face was absolutely priceless as she was trying to understand what just happened. I smile at her, take my headphones out and play some death metal way too loud so that she can definitely hear it (I might have hearing loss). I don\u2019t even like death metal, but it was definitely worth it knowing she was annoyed the whole time.\n\nMy gf was a bit lonely I didn\u2019t sit next to her for the bus ride but she ultimately agreed it was the best way to get back at her.",

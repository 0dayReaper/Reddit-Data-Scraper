    "postText": "So my old boss was a narcissistic demon from Hell. I know that sounds melodramatic and that the term narcissist is overused these days, but I promise this time it applies. I also started researching how to interact with narcissists, and almost as soon as I started grey-rocking her, she lost interest and went to find another victim. For context, I work in the health care field, which is perfect for people like her because she could constantly use her employees\u2019 desire to do right by their patients against them. Her favorite things were to put you on the spot in front of people and to question your dedication/intelligence/integrity at any given opportunity. A huge pet peeve of hers was if she didn\u2019t have all attention on her at all times. There was very much a teacher/student dynamic at play, which obviously didn\u2019t sit well with me as a fully grown adult human. I looked at my phone once during a meeting to check the calendar because we were talking about the schedule, when I looked up, everyone had stopped talking and she was leaned forward in her seat, eyes wide, staring at me with such a look of disgust on her face because my eyes drifted from her for 5 seconds. In trainings, she wouldn\u2019t teach us anything about the topic at hand and would instead talk about herself and her resume for an hour and a half with no regard for anyone else\u2019s time or commitments. If you dared to look at the clock during one of these trainings, she would call you out and tell you she wasn\u2019t done yet or ask if you had somewhere else to be, etc. And god forbid you yawn during a meeting with her. But she was our director at the time and we just had to take it. \n\n  \n\n\r  \nCut to nearly a year after I started, and she announces that she\u2019s taking over a different team and will no longer oversee our department (cue internal cheering and bottle popping). We had one last meeting with her and our new director to discuss the transition, etc. and I was gifted the beautiful opportunity to mess with her just a little. She was seated at one end of a long conference table and I was at the end on the same side as her with one or two people between us. Toward the beginning of the meeting, I noticed that if I angled myself juuuuuuuust right in my chair, she wouldn\u2019t be able to see me because a coworker\u2019s head blocked her view. Obviously she notices immediately and scoots back a little in her chair so she can maintain eye contact with me. After some time passes, I move again and she can\u2019t see me, so she scoots. So I do it again. And again. Until the end of the meeting rolls around and she\u2019s basically scooted all the way back against the wall so she can continue to keep an eye on me. \n\n  \n\n\r  \nI confessed to my coworkers once we were free from her and they were all confused about why she was acting so weird and it gave us all a good laugh and also took some of the fear we all had for her away. I left that job a while ago because it was killing my soul, but that was definitely one of my proudest moments, even if it was petty. Sometimes petty is all you have, and like Kevin Malone said, \u201cit\u2019s just nice to win one.\u201d",

For example, using the grey rock method involves deliberate actions like avoiding eye contact or not showing emotions during a conversation. \"   \n\nBasically you stop giving your energy and focus to them. If you HAVE to reply to something, you use the bare minimum, such as 'yes' or 'no'.  Its like if a bully calls you 'fat', instead of getting angry or calling them names back, you say 'ok' and keep reading your book or whatever.",

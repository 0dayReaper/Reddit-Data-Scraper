    "postText": "Just found this sub and some of the posts made me chuckle so here is my contribution. \n\nMy ex at the time loves LOTR. Owns the Extended Edition for all 3 films and limited edition versions of the novels. Because I knew how much he loved them, I watched each Extended Version film 4 times with him over a time period of a month so 36 hours approx of my life was wasted on LOTR - no hate but that ex has ruined the films for me. \n\nMy favourite movie is the Perks of Being a Wallflower. I relate very much and the acting is superb. I wanted to watch this film again 2 months later and he said no and refused because \"we've already seen it\" and I saw red. We can't watch my favourite movie 2 times but we can watch the whole trilogy of yours 4 times and it's okay?! It's not so I hatched my plan. \n\nMy ex also has an extensive DVD collection, around 70-80 movies. So I swapped each film out with a different one. Took me all day to put the cases back right. He was also a little OCD with his DVD organisation so I then moved around a few cases to fuck with him. Guess who wasn't watching LOTR anytime soon :) \n\nFuck you David\n\nETA my bad guys, I just don't own any physical DVDs so I assumed 70-80 was a lot",

A guy who just started classes in January happened to be assigned a room just down the hall, and the dorm RA suggested he stop by the party to meet everyone, which he does.\n\nMy ex-roomie sees him moving around the room introducing himself, but can tell this guy is socially awkward AF, as he is clearly saying EXACTLY the same thing to every person as an intro.  So he gets to the group that includes about six other people, the RA, and my slightly inebriated friend. RA says, \"Hey everyone, this is the guy who just started classes who lives at the end of the hall.\" The guy jumps in and says, \"Hi everyone I am Marc...with a C.\"\n\nMy buddy sips his vodka and says, \"So your name is Cark?!?\"\n\nAnd the whole group loses it.  \n\nAnd everyone else at the party asks what is so funny, and immediately get told the joke.\n\nIt has been over three decades and EVERYONE from his class still calls him \"Cark\" at reunions and campus functions. The upside being that Cark became super popular over the whole incident, which helped the whole socially awkward situation.",

    "postText": "This happened a while ago, but, I just found this sub, so here goes.\nI used to live on the 3rd floor of an apartment that had its laundry in the basement. Which means 4 flights of stairs for me, no elevator, and I have a newborn so I'm washing quite a bit. So we have cubbies in the laundry room for our soap and stuff. I've lived there a year and never had an issue leaving my soap down there. Apparently, some new people had moved in that were using my soap. When I realized it, I left a note asking that they stop. Nothing. They kept using. Okay. Now I'm pissed.\n\nI got 2 bottles of soap. A blue colored one. And clear colored one. Marked the bottles CLEARLY that they belonged to me (so they couldn't accidentally say they thought they were theirs) filled the blue soap with blue Rit dye. Filled the clear soap with unscented bleach. And waited....\n\nDidn't take long. The next morning I hear screaming coming from the laundry room. 4 floors up I heard it. I waited a while and ventured downstairs. In the laundry room I found a bunch of wet clothes in the garbage that were bleach stained. 4 days later I saw a young man get into a car with a blue stained t-shirt.\n\nTouch my fucking stuff.\n\n**Front page! Oh la la! Aren't I fancy?**\n\nThanks guys!",

Gallons of milk, orange juice, packages of hamburgers and steak were missing.  Left letters on the fridge and I spoke personally to all of them...nobody fessed up.  Went on for weeks.  Labeled everything I owned.\n\nTo find the asshat, I put big labels on my orange juice saying  \"Supplements!  Do not drink\".    Added a pint of liquid magnesium salts I had for a scheduled colonoscopy, and 'voila' the culprit was quickly discovered.   Shit his bed, floor, hallway...and was evicted.   \n\nGood times.",

The farmer went down for murder - there was no reasonable expectation of threat to him personally, just his property.\n(I mention him being a farmer because he had a gun license - a rare exception in UK gun laws)\n\nI think that's where the line lies for many legal systems; you can't claim self defence just because they are in your home, but if there is a direct threat to your person then lethal force for self defence is justified.\n(I am also of the opinion that's where the moral line lies)",

To my mind, there's no reasonably foreseeable way that this deceptively-altered washing detergent could cause someone bodily harm. The only harm here is the damage to a person's property, but the persons/thieves harmed would be seen to be accepting the risk of this damage by using someone else's detergent without knowledge of the exact contents. The law does not put any great emphasis on preventing harm to minor property in a situation where the victim is stealing someone else's property. As long as the detergent was clearly marked as the owner's property, no major law is being broken.\n\nIf this were a case of a person putting bleach into their lunch in a communal fridge at work and someone else ate their lunch and got sick, that would be a much different case. The law puts much greater emphasis on preventing bodily harm for obvious reasons and therein lies the distinction between this detergent-trap and booby trapping. \n\nFor further example, if the person had put some chemical in the detergent that causes a serious skin reaction or something along those lines, it would be considered booby trapping. \n\n",

If the soap-stealers actually had it specified in their lease that laundry supplies would be provided by the landlord, and then the only laundry soap downstairs was soap some other tenant had labelled as private, it might have been a somewhat reasonable expectation that the problem wasn't a landlord remiss in their laundry supply duties but a tenant hogging (and thus themselves effectively stealing) those supplies. Using those supplies based on that assumption, while legally hazardous and inadvisable, could potentially be accepted as still not entirely improbable and unreasonable by a court. That way, even booby-trapping marked bottles could afford the thieving victims with legal recourse \u2013 but that would be a high-risk strategy, i.e. they'd lose more likely than not, and they could really only do anything if that was actually in their lease.\n",

Only can some people truly understand through being the victim of pettyrevenge. \n\nI once had someone who would take our clothes out of the washer and leave them on a shelf instead of putting them in a dryer or letting us know our clothes were done. And I never let them set more than five minutes. I had a timer on my phone. I figured out who did it by sneaking and watching through a window.\n\nFor a week or so, any time they did laundry, I would wait for them to leave, then open up the washer at the beginning of the cycle. Their clothes didn\u2019t get washed and then they had to wait for them to cycle through. \n\nEdit: to clarify, it wasn\u2019t the fact that they took our clothes out and just left them out. They\u2019d take our clothes out sometimes before the cycle was finished. Or if the clothes were washed, they\u2019d take them out, then start their own load and take up the dryers so even when I came back to switch the loads, there wouldn\u2019t be an available dryer ",

Well, I'm a citizen, and I didn't fear that threat. Plus you killed my dog. I wasn't gonna play fair anymore.\n\nedit2: His name was Dieso. He was shot because he ran up to one of the guys next door to greet them. He had sheep hearder in his blood but he was not a nipper. He just wanted to be pet. He was shot when one of the neighbors thought he was attacking. He never saw what was happening to him. We took him to the vet and they tried to remove the bullet but it pierced his heart. He died very quickly. We loved the mutt. He was such a happy big guy. We will always miss him. He did his job with valor and disregard to his own life. For that he will never be forgotten. ",

Don't leave your wash unattended for the immediate future. I once had some asshole toss light bulbs in the dryer. I wasn't feuding with anyone so I'm guessing it was kids being cute, but still that's a pretty big asshole move. That's the problem with a justified lesson like that, unreasonable retaliation. Maybe a nanny cam you can leave with the clothes as they wash? I still like what you did, but people can be real assholes trying to get the last word. Good luck.\n",

Even with the bleach being unscented, it still stunk like bleach. How/why they didnt notice this I dont know? My guess is, they were in a rush (as so they wouldn't get caught using it) and rather than carefully measuring out a cupfull, they just eyeballed it and dumped some on top of their clothes. That's what the clothes in the bin looked like, big splotches of bleach stains on mostly jeans.\n\nThe kid I saw with the blue shirt, it was a white undershirt that was now a faint blue, and very splotchy. Clearly a bad dye job. As he was fairly young, I believe it wasnt him, likely his parents who were stealing it/doing wash.",

I started having to bring my laundry detergent into the house instead of leaving it where it's convenient.\n\n&gt;I don't have any dye though. Can I substitute ammonia for the same effect?\n\n**DO NOT DO THIS**. If whoever steals your (now) ammonia mixes it with bleach (not terribly unlikely in a laundry situation), you've set them up to make chloramine vapor, hydrochloric acid, and chlorine gas. In addition to being dangerous (read: potentially lethal), it's grounds to be charged with setting a deadly trap which is never legal.\n\n",

    "postText": "One of my biggest pet peeves in parking garages is when the neighboring car parks way too close to my car. I have a fairly small frame\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t need to suck in my ribcage while I try to squeeze through the 4 inches of space they give me to access the driver door. I\u2019m tired of how inconsiderate those people are and decided they needed some form of feedback. So now, I fold in the side view mirror on their car to help \u201cmake space\u201d if they don\u2019t give me enough room. Nothing serious or damaging; just a minor inconvenience that will take them an extra few seconds to fix before they leave the garage.",

My leg barely bent and I\u2019d swapped cars with dad since he had an automatic and it was my left knee. We\u2019re right hand drive here so I needed the car door opened to maximum to be able to get in and out with my barely bending leg. I parked away from everyone, on my own in order to not get in anyone\u2019s way. Make my purchase and go back to my car and with no less than 30 other empty spots - all much closer to the shop - some numpty parked right next to me on the drivers side. I mean, it\u2019s generally accepted parking etiquette to leave a space between cars if there\u2019s space to do so, so this was doubly annoying.",

I had shoulder rotator cuff surgery back in 2009 and while I had already gotten over the arm sling, I still was healing and getting back my strength on that arm. I had to hoist myself over my center console (at the time a Honda accord was my car) because some punks parked so close that one couldn\u2019t even open the door three inches. Students from the local high school always used our office lot across the street as they never had enough parking so we had issues like this a lot.",

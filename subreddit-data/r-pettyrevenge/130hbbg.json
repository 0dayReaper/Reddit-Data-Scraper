    "postText": "There was this guy who was courting me on my second year and I thought he was funny and cool but didn't really want to date him because he had a reputation for being a flirt and cheating on his girlfriends. I've turned him down a few times already but he was persistent. (He ended up stalking me until university \ud83d\ude43)\n\nHis jealous ex girlfriend sent me a letter. She had one of her friends pass it along to one of my classmates and the letter eventually found its way to me.\n\nI thought it was going to be a warning about how this guy is a manwhore or something -several girls in my year have received warnings like that- but no it ended up being a very long letter filled with every insult and curse word she knew.\n\nThis girl was so mad at me because her ex left her and started pursuing me and accused me of \"stealing\" him when I haven't spoken to him outside of me turning him down for the third time that year.\n\nThis wasn't my first hate mail but I was getting tired of girls accusing me of stealing their boyfriends when I don't even interact with them! I was very shy and introverted and couldn't understand why boys liked me because I had very low self esteem and was suffering through an eating disorder at the time because I hated how my body looked.\n\nI decided to write her back and insulted her in a way that she will remember to this day but doesn't really involve me writing anything bad to her.\n\nFor context, I live in the Philippines and while English is the medium of instruction in school, not everyone is good at it. She wasn't good at it.\n\nI simply rewrote her letter but fixed all the spelling and grammatical mistakes and added a note at the end\n\n\"P.S. I noticed you used *son of a bitch* to describe me but since I am female *bitch* would have sufficed. Please tell me how else I can help you with English!\"\n\nI personally gave her the letter myself when she and her pack of friends were strutting in the hallway outside my clubroom. I say strutting because one of my classmates noticed them walking past our clubroom several times pointedly looking at me and huffing.\n\nI called out to her on her next parade past our clubroom and handed her the letter with a smile and said in the sweetest voice I could muster\n\n\"Thanks for the letter! I hope you like my response!\"\n\nShe was taken aback and walked away and I saw her open the letter with her friends. She burst into tears.\n\n\nThis girl avoided me in the hallways through all of highschool and I never got another hate mail from anyone ever again. I did end up with a reputation for being incredibly cruel even though I simply helped her with her letter lol",

But I think what really got to her was that her friends saw the letter too and she couldn't just cover it up and pretend nothing happened.

I have never come across the opposite. Nowadays it's a lot more equal and I'm not even sure if courtship still exists.",

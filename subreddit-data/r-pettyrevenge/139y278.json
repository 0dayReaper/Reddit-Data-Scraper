    "postText": "This feels like a petty revenge to me, and wanted to share. Few years ago I went through a divorce. It ended because he was cheating on me, and still denies it (the AP and him were married and had a baby less than a year after our divorce, so you tell me lol). He was also emotionally abusive. To be fair, he has a lot of mental health problems. And I hope he\u2019s doing better, just as long as I\u2019m not around him. \n\nA few years before that, though, we moved my grandmother from another state to live with us so I could care for her. My grandfather had passed about 2 years before that. One of the things he left behind was this very pretty glass mixer and shot glasses (like what you\u2019d see at a bar to mix drinks) that had some gold decorations on it. My grandmother didn\u2019t care if she kept it, so my ex asked if he could have them. She said yes. I really like them too, and they belonged to my grandfather and that means a lot to me. I was very close to my grandfather, and his passing was very hard on all of us. Everyone loved him, even my ex loved him. \n\nAnyways, when we got divorced he came and got a lot of his stuff. He asked me to pack some of it, so he wouldn\u2019t be in my home longer than necessary. He then asked me to pack the mixer and glasses. At first I said sure, but the more I thought about it, the less I wanted him to have them. They were my grandfathers, they are very fragile and packing them would have to be done carefully and they could still break if one wasn\u2019t careful\u2014and tbh I don\u2019t trust him to not break them on accident. So I kept \u2018forgetting\u2019 as I had no way to pack them properly. Inevitably, he had gotten 99% of his stuff and it was basically understood that everything left was mine. And I never packed them. He had asked me a couple of times, and I made excuses. \n\nBeen 4 years and they are still proudly displayed in my home. Way I see it, it\u2019s payment for what he put me through and imho they were more mine than his. Petty? I think so, absolutely. But oh well, I\u2019m content.",

She\u2019s still super cool with daddys brothers and sisters too who wouldnt let her leave the family either lol.",

For my own mental health I haven't reached out to him since that visit, and since he won't reach out himself, we're essentially no contact now.\n\nI think the second to last thing I wrote him (before said visit), was asking if his side of the family might have a history of depression (to check if my depression at the time might be partially inherited). He reacted like I had gravely insulted both him and his entire family tree. To the point that he ignored my announcement a few months later that I was going to visit family on his part of the globe and instead turned up one morning while I was visiting with my grandparents and asked/demanded I spend the day with him.

Especially children who have thought of you as daddy since before their memories begin.  He even insisted on paying child support for my brother and me, not caring even a little that we aren't biologically his.  My bio dud was absent for most of my life; my dad was there for me always, before and after the divorce, even after moving to another state.  He also broke up with several women he was dating because they couldn't accept his close relationship with all four of his kids.\n\nI danced with him at my wedding.  I called him when my second baby was born not breathing and quickly rushed out of my room to resuscitate.  He visited us in NICU, driving 6-8 hours each way just to take me to lunch and give me a hug.\n\nI am so incredibly blessed to know what it is to be chosen.  And I love it when family transcends legal relationships.",

What was he going to do with 12 5-pc china sets plus serving dishes in a 1br NYC apartment? I assume he thought they were worth $$$, but wedding china is just like driving a new car off the lot - expensive to buy, no resale value. I didn't care, because I was left (we lived in a state besides NY) with 2 small children, and needed the everyday dishwasher safe china anyway. Who has time to wash gold rimmed china when you're taking care of small children and working 3 jobs?\n\nI later heard from the kids (who were bigger then) that he'd used our wedding crystal to toast his engagement to his now wife. Super weird.\n\nDon't miss that guy - or the wedding china and crystal - at all!",

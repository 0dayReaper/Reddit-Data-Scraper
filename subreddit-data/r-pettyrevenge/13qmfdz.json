    "postText": "Last weekend it was really nice weather where I live, so I decided to go for a bike ride. As I locked the door on my apartment I heard the elevator go up and when I looked at the display I saw that it was two floors above me. I thought \"That's not so bad\" and pushed the button to send the elevator to my floor. After a while I realized that the elevator had not moved. \n\nI could hear muffled voices from above, so they were clearly holding the elevator open while they were arguing about something. After a while the elevator started beeping loudly, which is what happens when you hold it for too long. The beeping stopped pretty quickly and I thought \"Ah, finally. They let the door close.\" Nope.\n\nAll they did was to release the door to stop the beep and then hold it again. Which resulted in it beeping again eventually. They were still arguing about something, but I couldn't make it out. By the second beep I gave up and decided to walk down. I figured stopping on my floor unnecessarily would be their punishment. Then when I got to the floor below mine I decided that this wasn't enough. So I clicked the button on that floor too. And the next one. And the next one. Eventually clicking the button on every floor on the way down. \n\nIf you are in *such* a hurry that you can't afford to let go of the elevator. Maybe actually use the elevator. Or enjoy an elevator ride down that is seriously slower than walking.",

To even pull into my spot, one of them had to run to the front door and back around in order to unlock the garage door from the inside. Because they didn't have a parking spot, and no garage code, and no spot. \n\nI waited patiently for this entire process and not a wave or thank you or sorry when they moved the car. Whatever. I parked then went to the elevator and she was holding the door for him to park elsewhere. She only had a few bags and an awkward lamp. I got in and waited for her to say something and she asked if we could wait for her BF to park. I gave it all of 20 seconds but said \"what are other people supposed to do? There's a freight elevator for things like this\" - in a normal and clam voice. But I shook my head as I knew I'd have to walk up the stairs.\n\nSo I walked up the 12 flight of stairs while hitting the elevator button on each floor. Went up a few more floors in order to waste *their* time and to make sure they didn't know which floor I lived on. Next day there's a note on my car about how I was mean to this guy's GF and what an asshole I am and blah blah. \n\nWTF is wrong with people? If you're waiting on someone else, don't prevent others from using the shared elevator. Everyone has places to go. Everyone has their own shit to carry. I have grocery store hauls that had more shit than they did. Wish I would've attached a reply about common sense to them in the elevator. But I was just glad to know I pissed them off.",

We found quickly out that the friend who took the stairs had pressed all elevator buttons on the way down. But we shared the elevator ride with an elderly lady from the top floor. We apologized to her for the friend's behaviour, but she did not really care about this obvious joke. One of us got a great idea for revenge and asked the lady to act like she was very angry to that friend, and she happily agreed.\n\nSo we got finally at the ground floor, where our friend was waiting for us, snickering about his prank. But then a furious elderly lady came out after us and scolded the friend for his prank. His face went from snickering to ashamed in no-time, while we burst out in laughing. You prank us, we prank back.",

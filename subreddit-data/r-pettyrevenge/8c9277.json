    "postText": "So a few weeks ago my brother, sister and myself (all in our early-to-mid 20\u2019s) took a little siblings vacation to California for a week, first time we\u2019ve ever done anything like this. So a few nights into the trip we went to a basketball game in Sacramento, after a day where we had been drinking on and off. As we took our seats I took my jacket off and placed it on my seat. Knowing I have a penchant for being somewhat forgetful, I asked my sister if she could remind me about it as we left, to which she looked absolutely disgusted and remarked \u201cI\u2019m not your mother\u201d. Well sheesh we were having a very nice trip to this point and I had no clue that kind of reaction was coming, but whatever I figured she was cranky or something and let it go. Wellllll wouldn\u2019t you know a few nights later we had gone out to eat, and she was the first one to stand up and walk away from the table, leaving her purse on her seat. I did what any responsible older brother would do and quickly snatched it up and hid it inside of my jacket. After we had walked about 7-8 blocks away from the restaurant I made some remark about how weird someone else\u2019s purse looked and she immediately realized what she had forgotten, and began running back towards the restaurant. I filled my brother in and we took a nice casual walk back to the restaurant where my sister was freaking out because her purse wasn\u2019t there. I simply held up her purse, looked her straight in the eyes and said \u201cI\u2019m not your mother\u201d. It was gloriously cathartic. ",

Over the corse of 3 months of this, moving them  farther and farther away from where she put them down. Until I started putting them in another room entirely. Different room each time. I kept doing this for another 2 or 3 months getting weirder and weirder with where I put her things. She almost snapped when she found her make up bag in the fridge and her phone in the plate cupboard. I stepped it back just a touch after that. 2 weeks later I just stopped. No easing her out of it. Just done.  The look on her Face when when her phone was where she left it for the first time in almost 7 months was priceless. ",

It has too many valuable items to just absentmindedly forget. Don't take it if you're going to forget it. That situation doesn't apply though, unless you've actually asked. I'll definitely catch what you miss if you tell me to keep an eye out for you missing it. But not after you've already made it clear you would rather worry about only yourself. My sibling and I always went by \"Don't dish what you can't take\". Seems applicable here. \n\nEdit: spelling, wrong word used (sorry)",

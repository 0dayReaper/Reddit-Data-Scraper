    "postText": "For lunch a group of my coworkers, our foreman, and myself would sit and each lunch in the foreman\u2019s little hut everyday. My seat was an empty lidded 5 gallon bucket and everyday as I was getting ready to sit one coworker would kick it across the room before I had a chance to sit down. Everyone found it hilarious. It was funny the first couple times but it got old. \n\nSo one day I thought it would be hilarious to cut the bottom of the bucket off and then fill it with nuts and bolts and put the lid back on. \n\nThat day at lunch we go in he tries to kick the bucket, of course it goes nowhere and he angrily picks it up and tosses the bucket across the room. And of course as he picks the bucket up all the nuts and bolts go spilling out of the bottom. It was hilarious and everyone in the hut was laughing. I had brought in a camping chair pulled it out and sat down and said, \u201cDamn man looks like you have a mess clean up!\u201d",

They were both equal in position, so neither out ranked the other in position or time with the company.\n\nTheir Supervisor and the Manager over their area did not address it seriously. Just gave them both a speech time after time and nothing changed, in fact their issues escalated. \n\nThe main boss over the entire facility got tired of their foolishness effecting the work environment of the entire department. He called them both into his office and told them, IF there is another incident WHOEVER started it is fired! Right then, on the spot, NO more 2nd chances! So get your acts together and end this foolishness!!\n\nWithin a few weeks there was another fight.  The Big Boss talked to the other co-workers, called the 2 men to his office &amp; talked to them one at a time. Talked to M first, then talked to L.  After talking to everyone he told them, he had warned what the consequences would be. He fired L, told him to clean out his locker, turn in his badge and keys and to leave the facility.\n\nL was furious! Blamed M for getting him fired from the job he worked at for 20 years. He went home, loaded up his deer rifle and pistols and drove back to the facility. All the Big bosses and secretaries worked in a building across a parking lot and on hill from the facility.\n\nIn walked L. One of the secretaries saw his rifle, went up to him and said, L you do not want to do this, Please give me the gun! He raised it pointing it at her. Then said, I didn\u2019t come here to hurt you, but I will. You need to go back and sit down or you will be first. \nShe did as she was told.  And L walked down the hall. He stopped at the Supervisor over his department\u2019s office and walked in. As C saw him with the gun he stood behind his desk and asked, what was going on?\nL fired once shooting him mid chest. When he fell L stood over him and fired again point blank into his back. L then continued down the hall toward the next office, where the Superintendent over the entire facility was in his office, J.  J had heard everything that had happened earlier. He asked L if there was anything he wanted to talk about? L said No and killed J as he sat at his desk. He left the offices, walked down into the facility looking for M. The first person he met was MM, he stuck out his hand and said to L, you do NOT want to do this! Just give me the gun and I will get you some help. They had been friends for over 20 years. L lowered his gun, pointing it chest high at MM and said, I have already killed 2 I am not stopping now, so back off and get out of my way or you will be 3.\n\nMM took of running for the offices to see if he could be of help. While L continued looking for M, the man he blamed for everything.\nL never found him, they were both walking in circles opposite of each other. M had heard of the shooting and was heading to the office to see if he could help. L kept looking until he heard the sirens.",

You a pussy?\" and then \\*did it to him again\\* a few hours later. \n\nLater that day, the warehouse fire alarm went off. They all had to evacuate outside where everyone saw the pranker's motorcycle (a Harley) was engulfed in flames. The victim was outside near it in his pickup truck, holding a gas can. When the prankster saw his ride bruning, the victim shouted, \"why you mad, brah? It's just a joke! Don't be a pussy!\" and drove off once the owner started chasing him.\n\nNo idea if anyone suffered any further consequences.",

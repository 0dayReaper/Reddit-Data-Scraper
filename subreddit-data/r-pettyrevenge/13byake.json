    "postText": "I was subbing for another science teacher for our seniors. They're a great group, with a few that are going to push buttons. Not mean or malicious at all, just seeing what they can get away with. The teacher had left them some online work that was fairly interesting (online games on the subject, short videos, that kind of stuff) and they could finish it in less than an hour. This left another half-hour to relax in a 90 minute period. The rule was, FIRST do the work, THEN chill, nap, whatever.  Didn't even require them to remain in assigned seats, stay silent, or turn off music (if the videos were done). Two of my students were doing anything but the assignment. I warned them a few times, then opened the program that lets me see what's on their screens. Nope, not a single bit of work completed, while the rest of the class was sailing through it.\n\nI took over their computers and locked them out, changed the volume to speakers instead of headphones, and cranked it up. First guy had his computer play the My Little Pony remix. The second one got Baby Shark. Loud, for the entire class to hear. I gave back control, eventually.\n\nThey got their work done, and still had time to relax afterwards. And the rest of the class got a great laugh out of it!",

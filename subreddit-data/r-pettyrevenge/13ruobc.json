I started getting calls all the time from collection agencies looking for Cassie. I would tell them they had the wrong number and block them but they would keep calling from different numbers. One day I was grocery shopping &amp; the store had one of those walls with all the manager's names &amp; pics. Low &amp; behold the floral manager was Cassie Smith. I went over to the floral section and asked Cassie if her phone number used to be the number i now had. She admitted that had been her number. I asked her politely if she could give her creditors her number because I was getting constantly harassed by them. She wasn't happy with me and proceeded to yell at me and then found &amp; harassed me on facebook. I tried to explain that I was just some innocent person who just happened to get her number &amp; didn't deserve to deal with her mess. I went home &amp; every time one of those creditors called I proceeded to give them Cassie's work name &amp; phone number.",

Newspaper auto renewed me anyway.  I never paid and they tried going to collections.  The collections company tried saying \"that's not how it works, once it renews you have to pay\" and I politely told them I made absolutely sure that my purchase was not a renewable one as part of the fundraiser and they as a collections company had two choices since they bought a provably bad debt from the newspaper company: They could make the newspaper buy the debt back, or they could try to file on my credit which I would successfully appeal seeing as I still had my \"donation\" receipt.  They tried collecting on that for about a year before they gave up, but never did file against my credit reports :p",

You can (possibly) sue your ex for damages for failure to pay (or get her held in contempt), but if they don't have the money to pay for the car, they probably don't have money to pay you.\n\nMy ex was late with her car payments before our divorce was final, but after we separated.  Unfortunately, I was on the note.  After three months of regular calls, I offered to sign whatever paperwork they wanted to repossess the car (as I was on the title, but I didn't have custody of the car, as my ex moved out of my state).  The lender declined and put the loan into forbearance, which was enough for my ex to remain caught up.",

Yet we still wanted an outgoing line that wouldn't be interrupted by (usually junk) fax calls. So we asked the phone company to change our old fax number after a month-long transition period where we forwarded the old fax number to the new one. Then we changed the number with no reference of calls, so anyone calling the old number would get \"the number you have reached is not in service\" recording.\n\nThe problem was that the number they gave us was previously owned by a deadbeat. I was the unfortunate person who had to handle it. I had to put up with every utility company in Toronto, not to mention the Canada Revenue Agency, looking for \"Juan Douche\" demanding payment for past debts. That was a fun few days telling every one of them, \"Sorry, we were just assigned this number. I have no idea who Juan Douche is, nor how to get a hold of him. Please remove this number from your list.\" Fun times indeed!",

Then bail &amp; fall off the earth when it comes time to deliver.\n\nMost ppl, at least at this particular company, made bonuses based on getting ppl to pay. So you'd be wasting their time they could've used to get someone else to actually pay &amp; then not deliver. \n\nThough, I would just recommend using a premade script asking them not to call back or they'll be reported type of thing. Because once they make contact the debt window resets. That's if you're waiting for it to fall off after 7 years that is.\n\nI do have to say being versed on the laws surrounding collection &amp; using that against them can be just as annoying for them. Making your account uncollectible would make them completely lose interest in it. The company wants the money any way they can. But they won't push for collections on \"dead\" accounts. Dead as in unreachable. They throw those to the newbies for \"experience\" &amp; if they get ahold &amp; collect all the better for the company. \n\nAt least that was my experience with that company. \n\nThe ones that got their bonuses every pay period were honestly scary. They were so good at manipulation &amp; were proud of it. I really did hate being with those types of ppl &amp; that place. \n\nThe training consisted of manipulating us into thinking we're doing a good thing for ppl. That we're helping ppl. Then the next minute taught us to try to convince ppl to borrow money to pay it. They didn't care how they got it or what that did to these ppl's lives. Even if someone has a no income &amp; their report said they're struggling in the worst ways they told us to get them to get their family to pay it. Or if there was a phone bill on their credit report that they must have some money if they can pay that &amp; to sell the phone to pay. Then free up that bill's money each month to pay them instead. \n\nWhat sucked the most is the vulnerable ppl who fell for these tactics. \ud83d\ude1e Those that got their bonuses did so much harm. They loved &amp; laughed when getting the vulnerable or young ppl who didn't know any better or believed their threats. \"Those are my favorite!\" Ugh.. made me feel so awful watching them manipulate those types of ppl &amp; then laugh about it.\n\nEdit: spelling, also sorry for wall of text. I haven't thought of this in a long while but it's all coming back now how much it sucked.\n\nEdit 2: oh! I just remembered. I don't know anything about debt consolidation &amp; if it's the right thing to do. But I do know they HATED ppl who called debt consolidation places. The consolidation place sets a price &amp; they deal with the collections ppl. The bonuses every pay period ppl used to harp on accounts under debt consolidation. They WANT to talk to the account owners so they can weasel into them &amp; break em down. But if they're under consolidation we were not allowed to talk to the account holder any more, period.",

If you hold out about being able to pay them they will try to get it by settlement offer, if they are available for your account. That's by talking to them though.\n\nIf you want a dead account, you just need to make sure you NEVER answer their calls. If they go as far as calling ppl you know make sure, if they answer, that they all conveniently never knew anyone by that name or absolutely no way to get ahold of you; you're unreachable. They need to make sure to state never to call that number again every time they call. If they call more than 3 times after that, report them. Again, that was this company's policy. I'm not sure the actual laws around that based on the state you're in.\n\nAfter awhile you'll get less &amp; less calls. You'll be put on the back burner so to speak. They'll make a call now &amp; again to try but their collection efforts will be severely diminished. If it isn't viable as a possible collection they take a step back &amp; will work on accounts that are more profitable.\n\nThat also will get you settlement offers quicker because their last ditch effort will be to do anything to get anything from you.",

On lunchbreak I chatted with one of the investigators who told me an interesting (albeit devious and unethical) tactic.  In the UK, for landline to landline calls, only the person who initiated the call can terminate it.  The recipient can put the phone down and 'hang up' - but if they lift the receive seconds or minutes later, and the person who initiated the call has not hung up, the call would still be live.  This is relevant...\n\nInvestigator would call debtor's landline, looking for John Doe who was hiding from his creditors:\n\n'Hello, can I speak with John Doe?'\n\n'Who's calling?'\n\n'It's Jane, his old friend'\n\nPAUSE... 'Oh he doesn't live here any more, sorry'\n\n'OK, sorry to bother you.'\n\ninvestigator would not hang up, but the recipient would.  After a few seconds, the recipient would lift the receiver and try to call John Doe to tell him that his old friend Jane was looking for him, however they would hear no dial tone.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the operator, disguising their voice, would say: \"Hello Operator, can I help you?\"\n\n'Yes I'm trying to call John on 555-2365.\"\n\nInvestigator who then pretend they were going to connect but just hang up, secure in the knowledge they now had John Doe's new number.",

You dialed the 7-digit number and the phone company presumed the area code was the same as the one you were dialing from and patched it through.  \n\nI got a new apartment and land line phone (cell phones were very expensive and rare)... \n\nUnfortunately, my 7-digit number (in the 817 area code) was exactly the same as a \"Pick Your Part\" junk yard in the 214 area code. They published their yellow pages ad but didn't put in the 214 area code... Just the 7-digit number.  \n\nSo, I start getting phone calls from people dialing their number from the 817 area code.. But they didn't bother to type 214. The calls got routed to me... Folks asking if I had certain car parts in stock and what the cost was.\n\nInitially I went through an explanation that they dialed the wrong number.. which confused them because the number was the same. They didn't always understand the difference in the area codes.  They just knew they were reading the ad and it had my phone number.  \n\nI called the junkyard and explain the situation... They didn't really seem to care. I asked them to republish the ad with the area code... They didn't really seem to care. \n\nSo... So I just started answering the phone calls and quoting crazy low prices and encouraging the caller to come by and pick it up and ask for (name of the guy that blew me off at the junk yard)\n\nHilarity ensues.   \n\nEventually the wrecking yard folks figured it out and called me asking me to quit quoting prices and telling customers they had parts in stock that  didn't exist.  I agreed to do it only if they changed their phone number in their ads.  \n\nThey agreed .. It took about 6 months but eventually the ad expired and I started getting fewer and fewer calls.",

I had the unfortunate circumstance of sharing the same first initial with the Ex. \n\nShortly after we got the phone hooked up and were listed by our Initials and last name in the phone book, the creditors started calling. On the good side I knew where she worked.",

I didn\u2019t think much then noticed it was always the same first and last name.  It goes in spurts.  I will get the calls for two weeks then they will stop for a while.  I almost got written up at a job because I needed to keep my phone on due to a sick child and the phone wouldn\u2019t stop ringing.  I have had calls for everything for her.  It seemed like anytime she didn\u2019t want further contact she would use my number on the form.  I had a guy texting me asking about her house and wanting to buy it. I told him I wasn\u2019t her.  He would not stop.  I had to tell him to F off and blocked the number.  Several months ago,I was getting calls for her from a place that only spoke Spanish.  They called three times a day, each time from a different number so I couldn\u2019t block it.",

I would tell them that I couldn't help them because that's a personal matter and so they needed to contact the employee on their personal phone. \n\nThere was this one collection agency though that kept calling over the course of a week. I told them that I couldn't help them, but they continued to call. I got pissed so one day I started spam calling them. They would pick up, hear me ask for their manager and hang up. I would hit redial and start the process all over. They never called again after that day.",

It was a deal where you could tell which number was being called by the ring but it was just one line into the house.  Big mistake, apparently the number had previously belonged to some chick who didn\u2019t like paying her bills.   I kept telling the callers that this was my 10 yr old daughter\u2019s number and we did not know the woman.   Guy calls and will not take this for an answer and demands to speak to my daughter as he knows that she knows this woman.   Threatens me with calling the sheriff\u2019s department and having me arrested.  Okay a-hole.  Mind you hubby is listening to this entire conversation so I hand the phone to him.  He asks a-hole for his name, company and phone number and them proceeds to tell him that he is speaking to Deputy ***** and if he ever calls this number again he will be the one arrested.  Never heard from that jacka$$ again.  Do not mess with my kids.",

    "postText": "First time poster! This happened over 20 years ago, when I was in primary school attending the afternoon session. I must\u2019ve been about single-digit age so the fact that this quick-thinking petty revenge occurred to young me impresses (questionably) grown-up me to this day.\n\nI used to ride the school chartered bus every afternoon that would pick kids up from their homes in the same neighbourhood and bring them to school. While we wouldn\u2019t really make proper friends with the kids on the bus, you\u2019d find kids you\u2019d dislike pretty quickly. There was this one girl on the bus called Lydia who was a couple of years older I think, and she was pretty unpleasant. Unpleasant enough for me to remember her name to this day! I think it was mostly making snide comments and generally being a know-it-all. Not really that bad but being on the receiving end of that as a young girl made me feel pretty lousy.\n\nMy memory isn\u2019t that fantastic so I don\u2019t even remember what she said to me that day, but I knew that I was pretty done and I hated that I was not brave enough to retaliate. When we were all about to get off the bus, Lydia stood right in front of me. With her big fat ergonomic backpack in my face. With a handy dandy water bottle holder bit on the side. I noticed she had a screw top bottle in there filled with water, so I reached forward and quickly unscrewed it, but left the cap sitting on top. You wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell that it was open unless you really looked for it.\n\nThe doors open, Lydia gets off the bus and runs off while I quickly get off and leg it in the opposite direction, then I hear some satisfying screaming. So I look back real quick to see Lydia\u2019s skirt totally soaked down one side and her looking around in confusion, not exactly understanding yet what had happened. Oh it felt so good!",

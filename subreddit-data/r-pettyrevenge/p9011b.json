    "postText": "So this happened way back in 2013. \n\nI was living in a large space with 5 roommates. One of my roommates was know for borrowing food including expensive stuff like meat but never replacing it. \n\nWell one day I knew his mother was coming to visit and stay a few days and his mom absolutely loved horses, so what I decided to do was bait this roommate with horse meat. \n\nIt\u2019s not common in the US but legal to buy imported so I acquired some nice thin cuts and I sliced most of it and salted and left in a Tupperware I the fridge while I went it the rest of the package with the horse meat store label in the freezer.\n\nWell sure enough in the evening I noticed some of the horse is gone so I make a big deal about someone stealing some of my horse meat in front of his mom. \n\nThey go \u2018haha. Very funny. Sure it\u2019s horse meat.\u2019 And my roommate owns up to borrowing some meat he used to make him and his mom steak and eggs for breakfast and lies that he\u2019ll replace it.  That\u2019s when I pull out the package from the freezer and prove it was in fact horse meat and his mom burst into tears crying to her son \u2018how could you feed me horse.\u2019\n\nHe definitely at least stopped borrowing my meat after that.",

In Australia there are regular emu culls (btw the emu war is a half-truth at best but more a massive lie told to tourists) but the price they can get for emus in butchers etc. means are best it goes into local dog food...\n\nBut I loves that it was *soft* but chewy and full of juice... Also being aboriginal being shown by my dad the traditional way to hunt them was great bonding...\n\nEDIT: Guinea Pig meat doesn't sound appealing, but I would give everything a go!",

So once or twice we went out and saw the 3-4 beef cattle growing when visiting the friend on her property. The friend had told my parents \u201cthe one that looks like it\u2019s wearing socks is your one\u201d. My younger brothers took that as \u201cthat one is called Socks and it\u2019s ours\u201d. \n\nOne night as we\u2019re eating dinner the second youngest brother (would have been around 4, the youngest was a literal baby) says \u201ccan we see Socks again soon?\u201d Dad has a sense of humour that has him muttering \u201cyep, look at your plate and you\u2019ll see him\u201d, low enough that only the people either side of him could hear, being my mother, and one of the \u201colder\u201d younger siblings who was a young teen. That sibling said more loudly \u201cSocks is on my plate?!?\u201d Dad ended up being nailed in the ribs by my mothers elbow, 2 younger siblings started getting upset and the brother who originally asked sobbed twice, stabbed a piece of his sausage, put it in his mouth and said \u201cat least Socks tastes yummy\u201d\n\nCue the entire table losing it laughing. Some of us still had issues over eating an animal we had \u201cknown\u201d for a few months, but that line\u2026 still cracks me up when I think about it",

Chickens are not cute.  \n\nAnd.ducks - I'm opposed to anyone ordering duck if it's going to be a long car ride home, because duck farts are the absolute worst.  Even the half a second it takes to roll down the window is enough to singe my nostrils and make me scream in technicolor.  Ducks are kind of cute, I guess.  They just seem to fuck off and swim.  I don't know, I've never raised them.  I'd definitely refuse to eat a wood duck, just because they're too damn pretty.  It would be like eating a parrot or a peacock or something.  Sure, I could, but there's other stuff to eat that isn't more fun to look at.",

I would be surprised if this didn't play out in other harvesting.\n\nThere's also complaints about how agriculture promotes larger unbroken fields (primarily due to mechanised equipment that is useful for crop harvesting and growing), which means less trees, bushes, hedgerows, etc, than often small broken up livestock fields, all of which can decrease local biodiversity since you don't have the places small animals make home and use to survive. It's always going to be a trade off, is the unfortunate reality. Kind of why I tend to look at it as more a smallholders vs corporate issue than meat vs veg issue, the problems tend to be the incentives of capitalism that play in massive corporations that being you as much food as they can as cheaply as possible with as little expense to themselves to the buyer.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nThis took place between 2012 and 2015.\n\nBack in 2012, I was an insecure 22 year old, and I met a girl at a club. She was cute, alternative looking (pink hair, fish nets, etc) and she seemed to instantly be very into me. All stuff I liked at the time.\n\nWe started dating, and she went very serious very fast. Like she told me she loved me after a couple of weeks, wanted me to stay at her house for whole weekends, etc.\n\nBut then after barely a month, not 1, not 2, but 3 of my close friends came to me and told me she had tried to get them to sleep with her when I wasn't there. 3 of my friends in less than a month! \n\nI dumped her the same day, and she had the audacity to steal my favourite hoodie and refuse to give it back. Even worse, I found out over the next few weeks that she had cheated on me with at least 2 other guys I knew, as well as the 3 friends she tried to cheat with.\n\nI blocked her, moved on, kinda forgot about her...but then, 3 years later, she slid into my DMs. She had made a new facebook account, found me, and decided it was a good idea to reach out.\n\nShe told me she was sorry for the way she acted before, and then started complaining about her current boyfriend. How he was boring and weak and nothing like me, a real man. Sigh. On top of that, she started sending me very dirty messages...apparently she had got into BDSM since I last saw her. Coincidentally, I'd discovered a similar interest, so I decided to indulge her.\n\nSide point, she also told me she lived with this boyfriend, she had no job, he paid for everything.\n\nThis where the revenge plan started to form.\n\nI carried on talking to her, played into her BDSM fantasies (she told me she was a sub, I'm more naturally a dom), and made sure to agree and encourage her when she talked down her boyfriend etc. No hate on the guy, I didn't know him, but it helped move the plan forward. I knew she had cheated on him too, and he had never found out.\n\nAfter a month or so of talking like this, I asked her to meet. I offered to take her out on the town for a night, then fulfil all the fantasies we had been talking about. She agreed, so the next week we I did just that.\n\nFirst I took her out dancing, showed her a great time. During this time, it really hit me the kind of person she really was. She showered me with compliments, just as she had 3 years ealier, but this time I could see how disingenuous they were. She wasn't telling me what she thought, she wasn't even trying to make me happy, she was just trying to ingratiate herself. Her behaviour gave me a stark reality check about how she acted when I first dated her. Along with the things she had told me in messages about the way she manipulates, cheats on and lies to her current boyfriend, and other men in her life, and the way she had treated me, any doubts I had about my revenge were wiped away\n\nSo then I took her back to a hotel and made sure to play into every one of her fantasies. I won't get graphic, but she seemed to have the night of her life, and the next morning she told me she was going to tell her boyfriend she had cheated on him, and leave him for me.\n\nI said goodbye to her, and waited. A couple hours later, she texted me to say she'd done it, and he kicked her out. I can't remember the exact wording of my response, but the gist was 'I would never want to be with a liar and cheater, have a nice life'\n\nNo idea what happened to her, but good riddance.\n\nEDIT: Damn, you guys really made me realise I should've told the boyfriend what was going on afterwards, just to make sure he dumped her. At the time, I didn't have his contact details, and I don't think I knew his last name or how to easily find him online. If I'd tried I probably could've found him though",

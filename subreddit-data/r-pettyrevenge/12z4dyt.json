    "postText": "I live in a townhouse apartment with my husband &amp; our young son. The apartments where we live is basically one long building with separate units side by side with a small yard space separated by a wooden fence. There's 9 apartments in the block I live in &amp; another 7 across from it (like an L shape). So most of my neighbors are families with young children. But my neighbor right beside us lives alone. Has been since I first moved in in 2017. He got a dog (a larger breed not sure what kind but he is pretty big) in the early fall of 2022. When he first got the dog, he would take him for walks quiet often &amp; genuinely seemed more happy &amp; outgoing than his older self. Quiet, never left his apartment, a hermit type. His daughter would do all his grocery shopping &amp; whatever he needed.\n\nSo before the holidays, we noticed he never took the dog out anymore &amp; always left him in the back yard. He never even took the dog for a short walk to do his business. So the dog pooped all over the place that was within a chain/leash distance. We've asked him multiple times to clean up after his dog &amp; he always given us \"I will tomorrow\" line but never kept through. So now that all the snow is melted, all you see is dog poop everywhere. I got tired of it because we want to clean up our yard &amp; make it look decent (luckily we were able to put up chicken wire around our area to keep people out but there still is poop in thr vicinity)\n\nI went for a cigarette, and I just grew so tired of seeing/smelling dog poop &amp; since he wasn't making effort, I thought I'd help out. So I threw on rubber boots &amp; grabbed a rake. And I pretty much just sweeped it all onto his patio area. My thoughts were it's his belongings so it should stay on his area. So now I can't wait until tomorrow when he sees it lol that's all! \n\nIt was more so of a rant about how I can't stand it when people get pets but REFUSE to take care of them or even take responsibility for them. I have 3 cats &amp; I love them to bits! I can't imagine letting them squander in their own filth or be forced to accept a life style that that dont deserve.\n\n*edit for questions.\nOur yards are quite small. It's about 16 feet by 9? Feet space between each \"yard\". It's more of a patio area. Each separated by a fence between each unit while open towards the grass. And the grassy area is for everyone. Not just each unit. My husband works with his daughter &amp; brought up concerns over the dog multiple times. And after a talk, turns out the daughter is on very low contact with him because of family issues involving her son (his grandson). she went on in detail about how he's not a good person &amp; was against him getting a dog because she didnt want to be the one responsible for it. And for those commenting about me being a smoker. I dispose of my cigarettes properly &amp; don't just leave them around for someone else to deal with. The poop was literally all over his patio, communal area, all within a few inches of each other. It was literally a minefield of poop. And as im aware, he has no issues based off what the daughter told my husband. She's thinking about looking for another home for the dog if he won't take care of it.",

The neighbors would let their dogs out into their backyard, where they would sneak through a hole in the corner of the fence, come into my grandparents' yard, and poop all over the place, mostly beneath the clothesline where my grandma hung her laundry.\n\nThe way the backyard was set up, there was a shed in the corner, with perhaps a one-foot gap between the shed and the fence along the back and side. In other words, there was no way he could repair the fence.\n\nAnyway, he talked to the neighbors multiple times about their walking poop-spreaders, but to no avail.\n\nEventually, he just grabbed a shovel and started heaving their deposits into their yard. I watched him one time, and it was hilarious. For some reason, he had not been able to clean up the poop for several days, so when he got out to the yard, there were multiple piles to take care of. He picked up the first pile and tossed it gently over the fence, but with every subsequent pile, you could see it getting to him and he started flinging the crap with increasingly harder swings of the shovel.\n\nEventually, he started throwing each pile towards his neighbor's back porch, and even managed to get one particularly fresh one to stick to the wall of the house, next to the door.\n\nAmazingly enough, the hole in the fence was covered up the next day.",

We live in a townhouse condo, 10 feet from our building is considered ours, the rest of the property is communal.  So after several attempts to politely address the offending pet owner, including letters to all residents about the responsibility to clean up after their pets from the condo board which were ignored, *someone* decided to take matters into their own hands. I may or may not have planted the idea in the minds of several neighbors while enjoying an informal get together at another neighbor's house. More of a 'this would be awesome in a perfect world but probably illegal in this one' type of conversation. It's amazing how quickly people get the point when they go to get in their car and dog shit is under every door handle, causing quite a mess and nasty clean up for the offending party.  No one ever claimed responsibility, but even though I don't drink as a rule, I'd love to buy that neighbor a beer.  Or three.\nWe also had another neighbor (renters) who had several dogs that they never walked and simply let out on their 2nd floor deck to do their business.  The smell was horrific, the deck was destroyed and the condo board sent a letter to the unit owner stating that deck replacement would be the owner's responsibility.  These people destroyed this house, it took almost a year to make the unit habitable, they did all kinds of illegal (and dangerous) upgrades, somehow bypassed the gas and electric meters and they ended up owing the local gas and electric company thousands.  Luckily they moved out/were evicted, someone bought the house and there have been no further problems as far as I know.\nSometimes neighbors suck.  Sorry you have to deal with this.  Hopefully the man's relative can do something to remedy the situation for both you and the dog.",

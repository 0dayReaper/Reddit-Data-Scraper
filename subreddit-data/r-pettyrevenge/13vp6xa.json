    "postText": "My mum has a very Eastern European name and my paternal grandmother hated that her baby boy married someone with such a \u201cweird\u201d name (it\u2019s clearly not an English name but is well known in English speaking countries, like Helga).\n\nWhen my parents announced they were having a baby, my grandma\u2019s first comment was \u201cYou better not give it one of those weird European names\u201d so naturally, my parents started referring to me as Rasputin and kept their name choices secret.\n\nMum and dad also kept my gender secret which drove grandma insane and made her hellish to deal with on top of the name thing. My parents were **done** with this BS by the time I came along and wanted some revenge.\n\nMy maternal grandma, who was Ukrainian, had made me a baby hat with traditional Ukrainian embroidery. When I was born, my parents let the nurses in on their revenge plan and asked them to swaddle me in a blue blanket instead of a pink or white one and put that hat on me for when my paternal grandparents came to the hospital to meet me.\n\nGrandma walks in, sees my hat and then my mum says \u201cMeet your grandson, Rasputin. We got attached to the name during the pregnancy.\u201d Grandma was not impressed. Every photo of her she has the most impressive cat butt face.\n\nMy parents and the nurses kept up this ruse for 2 hours, the nurses going so far as to ask \u201cHow\u2019s little Razzie doing?\u201d when they\u2019d come into the room.\n\nAfter a while, mum couldn\u2019t keep it going any more and while my grandpa was holding me next to mum\u2019s bed, she told him I\u2019m actually a girl and my real, very \"normal\" name. He was a prankster, especially when it annoyed his wife, so she knew he\u2019d appreciate the joke.\n\nUntil he passed away, my grandpa\u2019s nickname for me was Razzie much to my grandma\u2019s annoyance.\n\nEdit: Corrected \u201cWestern\u201d to \u201cEnglish\u201d/\u201cEnglish speaking\u201d for the first paragraph. Thanks to the people who pointed out Germanic names are also considered Western, I was under the impression that Western and English speaking were interchangeable \ud83d\ude05 TIL!",

But TRADITION! \ud83d\ude44\n\nWhen my first child, a daughter, was born, there was a LOT of cat face from my mom that I decided to not name her Elizabeth. We named her a pretty typical American first name, a Japanese middle name to honor my wife's Japanese American heritage, and our last name. No Elizabeth.\n\nI strongly agree. Family members don't get to name our kids. Tradition be damned. I don't care about honoring that my ancestor was a serf serving a queen in the 1500s.\n\nEdit: clumsy wording re: my wife.",

When my brother was born my dad named him after this cousin, let's say Andrew Bernard Zacker. The next year my dad's other cousin, who was the late Andrew's brother, named his newborn son the same, but reversed: Bernard Andrew Zacker. Both boys went on to be called Andy.\n\nSo people would sometimes overhear my sisters and me talking about one of the boys, and be totally confused about what was going on. This is what they would hear:\n\"Who, Andy?\"\n\"No! I'm talking about Andy!\"\n\"Oh, do you mean Andy Zacker?\"\n\"Of course not! It's Andy Zacker!\"\n\nStrange as it may sound, the three of us would always understand from this which Andy Zacker was the object of the discussion while others would look upon us in utter befuddlement.\n\nThen both Andy Zackers had a son. Who they named Corey. So now we also have 2 Corey Zackers.\nAnd my sisters and I sometimes have the following conversation:\n\n\"Who, Corey?\"\n\"No! I'm talking about Corey!\"\n\"Oh, do you mean Corey Zacker?\"\n\"Of course not! It's Corey Zacker!\"\n\"To be clear, that's Corey Zacker, Andy's kid?\"\n\"Weren't you listening? I'm talking about Andy's Corey Zacker!\"\n\nNow both Corey Zackers are in their mid-twenties and I'm looking forward to the day they'll be having sons so my sisters and I will be able to continue to mess with people's minds.",

Like mine is an ash refrencing name. We traced it back, and i guess everyone with my last name came from one village  cutting down ash trees and making crap. But again, i agree with you that tradition should be fun and whimsy, not mandatory and resentment causing.   My wife and i both had traditional family middle names for girls. We love our moms, so we didn't mention doing it until after they were born. Then again we also flipped a coin to see who got first name with our first kid, so maybe we're  weird.",

It's because we Camerons were apparently brawlers back in the day. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af \n\nBut I get your point. Smith ancestors were blacksmiths, Taylors were tailors, Bakers were bakers, etc. And I was named after my dad and my grandad on my mom's side, both were Thomas. I understand why folks would name their kids with family names. But I definitely draw the line at requiring folks to name their kids something for \"tradition.\" \n\nWe ain't rich enough to be naming our kids Thurston Howell the fourth or whatever. ;-)",

I did the same with my daughter, too.\n\nIn my home country having two middle names is actually fairly normal, though it is less common where I live now / where my daughter is born.",

My mom was thinking I already had long and fairly \"ethnic\" last name for lack of a better word, so she wanted to keep my first name short and easy. That would not be accomplished with my grandmother's first name. When my grandmother's suggestion was turned down, her new suggestion (according to her) was totally was not at all related to wanting me to be named after her...\n\nit rhymed with her name and started with the same letter. It was also was even more obviously from the country that my last name came from. I've never even heard of someone with this name and it's 4 syllables long. \n\nI wouldn't necessarily have a problem with having a first and last name that were not traditionally American, but they're both fairly long and complex and a lifetime of spelling my last name for people has been annoying enough. Then, compared to my sister, it would have been very weird to have one of us with an all American two syllable first name then the second kid's got a tongue twister instead of a name. Very glad my parents told her no and stopped taking suggestions.",

It was a boy, I think it was the maternal father who said, \"If you don't choose the baby's name soon, I'm gonna call him Buster, and nothing else for the rest of his life!\"  The baby's name was something normal, but the entire family still calls him Buster (I think he's a teen now) from that one joke to the point friends of friends think the kid's real name is Buster.",

    "postText": "This is a short one. \n\nWe recently launched a project to a select group of beta testers. Late on a Sunday evening (I'm not paid to be on call or work on weekends), I get an email from the boss, cc'ing _everyone_ involved in the project, that the entire site is down, please can I get it sorted urgently, as this makes the company look bad. Complete with screenshot of the problem.\n\nI'm really glad for the screenshot. I didn't even need to open my laptop to see what the problem was. I'm mildly peeved at the tone of the email and I don't think including everyone plus the janitor was really necessary. So I reply-all to all, saying that the reason the boss is getting that error is because he has _typed the wrong website into his browser_.\n\nI get a sheepish mail from him the next day saying that no, it was actually one of the beta testers that had sent him the message about the website not working and screenshot, and he had just forwarded it, and wasn't he glad it wasn't actually a problem. Suuuuurrrre, buddy.\n\nVery petty, but I got a kick out of it.",

Ended up on an email where the supervisor of another department was being asked why a deliverable on a project was late, and they said it was my fault while cc'ing ~6 other department supervisors in addition to my boss and my boss' boss. I replied all with a copy of the email from 3 weeks ago where I asked for the paperwork needed before the deliverable could be completed, a copy of the company standard explicitly saying the paperwork was his team's responsibility and the deliverable couldn't be completed without it, and then I went above and beyond with a sickly sweet \"but I can see how urgent this is by your email so I've gone ahead and done the paperwork for you so we can expedite the deliverable\" like I was coaching a 5 year old. Thought that was the end and would be sufficiently embarassing for them. Nope. My boss proceeded to reply all that I'd once again exemplified what our department was all about by stepping up and doing other supervisor's job for him, and wishing everyone had my work ethic.\n\n2 years later, and no one has tried to throw me under the bus for anything since.",

We had a software where she would leave comments against each file reviewed if there was something to fix. \n\nThat included \"you've spelt xyz wrong\". But these files are internal use only and clients never see them. If you knew I spelled \"could\" as \"culd\" then just change it while reviewing or don't. You don't need to add tags everywhere. It's a typo. Everyone makes them. We were at a period of HIGH stress. She would leave tags on EVERY file. Because when it goes up to her manager, he would be able to see all the comments she'd initially left and what I'd done to resolve them. It seemed like she was leaving tags just to prove she was doing her job and actually reviewing the files. She never checked for actual value-addition. \n\nAnyway at one stage she'd asked me a VERY stupid question about not being able to understand a simple, commonly used English word (\"depreciate\"). I was made to go back into my completed file to fix her review points just so I could say we were done with the client. This, while I had 10 other clients hounding me. I copy-pasted the definition of the word into her review point as a response, very passive aggressively and also attached a link to an online dictionary. She called me aside 3 days later to tell me \"if you don't understand my review points, ask me in private. Don't put it on the file\". Like fuck off. I absolutely will put it on the file so her manager can see how nitpicky she was being. \n\nSometimes it's important to call these posers out in front of management.",

Then I took the client off (as you shouldn\u2019t blame or point fingers in front of a client especially when it wasn\u2019t my fault in the first place) I ccd our VP (who knew my manager due to his exceptional work and by extension myself for a few of my achievements) pointed out what *really* happened\u2026that it was *his*, or his direct reports responsibility with clear evidence where you scratch your head wondering why they would bring up their own fuck up and straight up lie about it? Especially in front of a client\u2026that I talk to on a daily basis\u2026\u2026that knows what responsibilities I have and what I give them has nothing to do with what he was referring to. \n\nI go on to explain how the only reason my name was attached to any of it was because while he was doing fuck all I* noticed we missed a deadline, tossed the half done slop, and did the work from scratch. But at least I made sure that it was sent out AT ALL and to the right parties no less! Had i not done anything it would\u2019ve been days before anyone noticed and would\u2019ve caused 3-4 major violations with monetary consequences. instead we got off easy with a \u201cglad nothing happened\u201d from the client. \n\nI reamed him out with as much office politeness as I could muster and thoroughly pointed out that it was his divisions error that he should be GREATFUL I noticed it at all. \n\nAll that I could forgive. But to cc a client, to downplay your obvious mistake, make our entire company look bad, never bothering to follow up with his mistakes nor back me up when *I needed it. \n\nAll I got back was a quiet \u201coh well who knows what really happened\u2026\u201d but the VP really let him have it and he came to realize what many already knew it was his mess up",

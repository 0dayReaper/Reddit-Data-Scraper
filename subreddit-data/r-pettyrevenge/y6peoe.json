    "postText": "So I work in technical theater as an assistant stage manager. There are a couple of theaters in the area but the tech community is rather small so we all know each other. I work for a smaller theater but I know a few people who work at the largest theater that hosts the traveling Broadway shows. These shows are really popular and hard to get tickets for if you aren\u2019t a season ticket holder and season tickets can run about 1,000 per seat for seven shows. Tickets are normally about $150 for an individual show but can go up significantly if they know the show is going to be popular. \n\nThe husband of one of the directors that I work with is on the board of the theater and sometimes can score good seats at a discounted rate. \n\nThis season, Aladdin is coming to town, a show my Future Mother-in-Law has been dying to see. She asked me if I could possibly get her and a friend a seat so they could go see it. I called in a favor with my director and she managed to get two prime seats. Since her husband is on the board she gets a discount so the tickets ended up only being $75 for the two seats. I reserved them in my name with the understanding that FMIL will pay for the tickets.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks and FMIL invites me and my fianc\u00e9 over for dinner. Dinner goes well and I end up in a conversation with FMIL and FSIL about housework (idk why). FSIL is a teacher and she is married to an accountant so she said that her and her husband try to split the chores 50/50. FMIL thought that was fine and asked how fianc\u00e9 and I would do it (we don\u2019t currently live together). I said \u201cprobably the same, ya know 50/50.\u201d FSIL agreed but FMIL gave me the stink eye. I asked if there was something wrong and she said \u201cwell fianc\u00e9 works full time and you don\u2019t so I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s fair.\u201d I told her that I do work full time just not at a 9-5 like fianc\u00e9. FMIL then laughed at me and said what I did wasn\u2019t real work and that it was just a \u201csilly side gig\u201d and that maybe if I got a real job I would know what it is like to really work. Then she changed the subject. \n\nThis pissed me off because I am very proud of the work I do. It may not be a nine to five but I love my job. It is my dream job and I do make enough to cover my expenses. It actually takes a certain amount of skill to properly stage manage a full scale production. \n\nSo, enter pettiness. I called up the box office for the large theater and told them to cancel the tickets. They were in my name so they gladly cancelled them. I then texted FMIL and told her if she thinks my job isn\u2019t real then the side perks aren\u2019t real so the tickets were cancelled. I then shut off my phone. \n\nThe next day when I turn on my phone I see several missed calls and about a dozen texts from FMIL. She is fuming because her friend is coming into town specifically to see this play. I called back and told her she might still be able to get seats if she called the box office. She ended up getting seats but they cost her $150 each and they weren\u2019t as good.\n\nHopefully she\u2019s learned not to insult someone and still expect to benefit from them.\n\nSorry for any typos.

Many people shit on nontraditional jobs, I believe, because they may have had to do work for years that they have been miserable at. To admit that there are other options for earning a living, I imagine it would be painful in part because they have to acknowledge that perhaps their years were wasted. The narrative of a job being a commitment that you just buckle down and do, even when you hate it, gets perpetuated by folks who are trying to maintain a certain status quo that validates themselves. They may view themselves as sensible, responsible, reliable people who do what has to be done, and that's somehow noble. It's kinda sad, really. And then their resentment can manifest in condescension and moral superiority.",

Be honest about what you can do and can't do. Theirs ligit a job for everyone. After a few shows, you get to know some people, and they know people, and if you pursue it you can turn it into something. Some colleges offer theatre tech degree and that can be a jumping off point too. But volunteer for a few shows first. Theater people - in front of the curtain and backstage - tend to be pretty big personalities lol, not everyone gets along with that personality.",

It\u2019s worth volunteering to usher a few times first, but then once they know you, inquire about the commitment to work stage crew. It usually means signing on for the entire run of the show, but it\u2019s totally worth it if you have the time. The view from backstage is a whole new way to experience theatre.

See if there's info on your website about joining their hiring list. At least my local is desperate as fuck for labor right now so this is an excellent time to get in. Lots of people changed careers and didn't look back during the pandemic.\n\nThe work can be intensely physical and the hours are whack but as someone who's been doing it for a month now (I did tech theatre in high school, majored in it in college, and have been doing it on the side of a desk job at a regional theatre so I'm not new to the industry) it's been incredibly rewarding already. As long as you are eager to learn and listen to instructions well you can probably get in and get going pretty fast.",

People treat food service and retail workers, healthcare workers, teachers, and all sorts of other people that perform essential work for all of their daily lives, like crap, say they shouldn't get paid more than chump change, that their jobs are not real jobs, that they're failures for having those jobs and not something \"better,\" and all this other bullshit. \n\nThen when everyone quits those jobs to go do something \"better\" or because they're fed up with the shit pay, shit conditions, and complete lack of societal respect, suddenly people realize how essential those jobs are, but rather than backtrack and think how they can make those jobs more attractive they pile more abuse and overwork on the dwindling supply of people still working them while moaning about how this generation is so lazy and doesn't want to work anymore.\n\nI'm in Japan for a few years working as an assistant English teacher - my job is definitely entry-level and what many will call \"not a real job\" and all, and I agree to some extent and also make very little money for doing it, but the amount of respect that I get from society in general for being a teacher even if I'm just an unqualified assistant and spend a lot of time deskwarming is night and day compared to the disrespect actual qualified, experienced, and skilled educators get daily in the US. My own mother has said on multiple occasions that teaching is just a last resort for people who've failed or given up on everything else in their field and it's incredible to me that people can actually think that and yet continue to send their kids to school and urge them to get an education and go to college and all this shit when they don't have an ounce of respect for the people teaching them.",

I tried to explain stage lights and the thirty foot rule but she insisted on doing something that looked cute and tasteful in the dressing room mirror.)\n\n\nOne of the other girls, V, who was doing running crew went into the dressing room with her to help lace her corset. I had offered but the actress said no thank you very firmly and so V went and helped her instead. I was a little bothered by the whole shenanigan but I was trying to be cool and I had enough on my plate lol. \n\n\nAnyway they finished the corset and my actress chilled the fuck out. Was completely low-to-no drama for the rest of the show.\n\nFound out later that V had laced her up while saying \"you need to stop. You're being a little bitch to GreenWitch and she really likes you. *You want GreenWitch to like you.*\"\n\n\nI guess that's one kind of pep talk.",

I got her wrangled by being her dresser.  \"S, Stockings &amp; Shoes on?  T-Shirt?   Lets get you laced up.\"   Get the corset on her, tightened up. \"Go finish your make-up\" ... \"Ready? Time to retighten and lets get the dress on you.\"  \n\n\nFolks were always giving us looks as this portly middle-aged guy is ordering one of the leads around, while she was wearing next to nothing.  \n\n\nThe 3rd, OMG.   PITA barely knew her lines at the start of tech week, despite having done the roll twice before.   Was always bitching about how much she hated community theater.   On and On.   Yet was nearly as demanding as the first 2, Director told her flat out NO to any of her requests.   She was threatening to quit.   The crew would mouth to each other \"Please do!\"",

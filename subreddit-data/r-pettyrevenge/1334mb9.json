    "postText": "For some reason, my(15F) older brother(17M) has started blasting music whenever he uses the bathroom. Nothing's wrong with listening to music, but it's the fact that he deliberately blasts it on max volume and repeats certain phases of songs for up to thirty minutes. My parents have asked him to stop. My other brother has asked to stop. HELL, I EVEN ASKED HIM TO STOP. But the songs get more annoying everyday, and he just keeps going. And the worst part? He just told all of us to deal with it, and it's not that big of a deal.\n\nCue the petty revenge. Everyday of this week, I sat inside my bedroom blasting \"I'm a Barbie Girl\" on repeat and holding it right up my wall(Our rooms are next to each other, and the walls are thin). Yesterday, my brother came up to me and yelled that he needed to study, and that my music was a distraction. With a smirk on my face, I told him to deal with it, and it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI'm writing this story because I saw my brother making his way to the bathroom earlier. With earbuds, this time. Revenge is a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world. ;)",

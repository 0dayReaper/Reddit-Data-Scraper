    "postText": "This story takes place 8 years ago when I was a sophomore in highschool. Some background I have always been extremely artistic and put in a lot of effort for any school art project. I've have won multiple competitions and when ever the teacher needed to use someone's art project as an example they'd often use mine. I was in no way academically gifted and scraped by most of the time in everything other than art so I took a lot of pride in being creative even if it was just drawing a map in history or cell examples in science. Other teens knew me as the chick who's good at art and usually left me alone, except when someone wanted me to do their work. This was one of those times with a girl named Hannah. Hannah was part of the popular crowd and would spend a good portion of class goofing around with the other kids in her group. On a few occasions I overheard them call me OCD and a try hard but always brushed it off as jealousy. The project we were working on was a colored pencil drawing of buildings to show linear perspective. I had drawn two buildings with an alleyway between them leading to another street, and on the wall of the alleyway I had drawn graffiti of random swirls that were dripping from the bottom in multiple colors. I guess Hannah had seen the graffiti and liked it because she came up to me with her paper and asked me to put graffiti on the side of one of her buildings too. I said no multiple times but she kept asking and saying that she wouldn't know how to draw it at an angle and that mine looks sooo good. Eventually I said fine and she gave me the paper and tried to walk off but I stopped her and asked what she wanted graffitied on it, words or a shape or something specific, but she said she didn't care then left. After sitting there for a moment wishing I just hadn't agreed I looked up online photos of graffiti thinking I would just copy a simple one and be done with it. One of the top images was of a brick wall with DEEZ NUTS spray painted on it and I, feeling a bit petty, decided to go with it. So on the side of her building in dark blue I drew DEEZ NUTS in large graffiti bubble letters complete with a dripping bottom. Not gonna lie it looked good and my friends who were sitting around me thought it was hilarious when I showed them. I went to her seat to give it to her but she was at another table hanging out with her friends so I just left it upside down at her spot and went back to mine. I guess she went back to her seat and saw it because the next thing I knew our teacher came over to my seat with Hannah in tow. She asked if I had drawn the graffiti and when I said I did she asked why. I explained what happened, that Hannah asked for graffiti and when I asked what she wants she said she didn't care, so I went online saw the DEEZ NUTS photo and went with that. She asked why I specifically wrote DEEZ NUTS and I got out my phone to show her the image I found online and that it's not a swear word so I thought it be fine, and I specifically asked what she wanted it to say but she didn't care. Hannah didn't say anything and just stood there looking shocked while our teacher looked both amused and disappointed but eventually just said ok and went back to her desk with Hannah. They talked a little before Hannah went back to where her friends were sitting, not looking my way for the rest of the class period. Nothing really came from this other than Hannah purposefully ignoring me in any class we had and some of her girl friends giving me the side eye whenever they were near me.",

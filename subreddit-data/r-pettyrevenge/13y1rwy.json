    "postText": "Hello fellow Reddit creatures, thought it\u2019s time to share a fitting little adventure from my college days. I am on mobile and English is my first language, so roast away if you like.\n\nThe city I went to college in is known for the various types of trees that grow through the downtown and student housing area. While quite beautiful, the roots wreck sidewalks and occasionally the sidewalks and streets have to curve to avoid them. They get uneven and drop off unexpectedly, and you definitely need to watch your step in places to avoid tripping or rolling an ankle. There are tons of tree varieties, with everything from big ole redwoods to citrus trees. Keep this in mind.\n\nOne fine weekday evening my roommate Joe and I are strolling home after a lengthy afternoon of day drinking at one of the local bars. We\u2019re walking our happy asses along the sidewalk when a group of 5-6 sorority sisters approach towards us on the same side. The sidewalk is wide enough for two people to pass, but has badly eroded as it swerves around some Redwood tree roots and drops off about a foot on our side. It\u2019s quite uneven. Joe drops behind me from walking side by side to let the girls pass. But do they go single file from their swarm to pass us? Of course not, if they did we wouldn\u2019t have a story, would we. They bump us off the sidewalk. There\u2019s a muttered \u201cmove\u201d from within the group, and I catch a dirty look from the pack leader. Joe and I stumble off to the side as they breeze by in a wash of Shein dresses and snootiness.\n\nNow friends, I have no problem with frats or sororities. I do, however, have a problem with rude people, and the beer-fueled brain cells are buzzing. I reach down, grab a several-day-old slightly mushy lump of an orange on the ground, and in one motion launch it as high as I can back toward the gaggle of galloping sorority sisters.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty normal dude, but it was like Roger Clemens himself tickled my arm that moment. It was majestic. My fruit bomb of justice apexes at the tops of the redwood trees like it was shot out of a cannon, hangs with the clouds for a moment, and begins falling.\n\nI didn\u2019t intend to hit them, I just wanted to explode it in front of them. They were a good 50 yards away by that point. But no. They fucked around, they gonna find out, and I badly misjudged the speed of a group of girls late for an event. The orange descends from on high and catches one of the group on the back of the shoulder and neck area and explodes like a grenade of pulp and stale orange juice.\n\nScreams are heard - \u201coh my god MY OUTFIT IS RUINED!!\u201d \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d etc etc sorority girl noises and consternation. They turn around. Joe looks at me. \u201cRUN.\u201d\nWe take off the other way, sprinting like Usain Bolt in the 100m into the middle of the street, laughing like hyenas all the way until we get home. \n\nNow folks, was my fruit bomb of justice really needed? Probably not. But don\u2019t be rude and force me off the sidewalk. Hope she enjoyed the party with her new perfume fragrance - fume de orang\u00e8.\n\n\nTLDR: Don\u2019t force me off the sidewalk I\u2019ll throw fruit at you.",

    "postText": "Ten years ago, I was at the movies with some friends. I had spiked my soda with Everclear (95% alcohol), but a friend of a friend, we'll call Bob, kept drinking it without asking. I'm not very confrontational, so I didn't say anything.\n\nBefore long, my drink was gone. While Bob was focused on the movie, I placed the flask of Everclear in my empty soda cup. I put the straw straight into the flask, and replaced the soda lid.\n\nA few minutes later, Bob took a sip. He immediately started coughing and gagging. He spit Everclear all over the floor. Everyone in the theater turned to look.\n\nIt took Bob a few minutes to catch his breath. He was coughing and clearing his throat for about 30 minutes afterwards. I felt a little bad for causing a disturbance, but I wasn't sorry that he choked on my drink. He should have asked before drinking it.\n\nEdit: Clarified what Everclear is.",

The other guy took a little sip and immediately puked it back up. Then it was my turn. I took the bottle looked at all of them and said \u201cy\u2019all are a bunch of pussies\u201d and proceeded to chug about 1/4 of it. Handed it back and smiled at their stunned expressions. Within about 10 minutes I went over to my buddies RoadRunner, hopped up on the hood, and passed out cold. Woke up several hours later. Apparently I missed a good party?",

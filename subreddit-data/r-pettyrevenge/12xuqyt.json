    "postText": "This happened roughly 20 years ago and my brother (this is his and my fave subreddit) told me this story belonged here as I had never told anyone this until recently.\n\nWhen I was 18 I worked part-time at a low end car dealership as the front desk receptionist... so we got a lot of colorful customers and unfortunately the occasional Karen complaining and raising hell about something ridiculous. Lucky for me, I was always the first person they came into contact with so I would sometimes get an earful over something I had nothing to do with. Well this particular broad (lets call her Betty) was a real peach. She was just incredibly entitled, angry, and demanding. The \"drop everything for me\" type of customer.\n\nWell... Betty came into the dealership one evening (I worked the afternoon/early evening shift). I was reading a magazine and put it down as she was walking in to greet her (this was her 4th or 5th appearance and I knew shit was going to go south). Well in typical Karen fashion she asked to see the manager. I honestly do not remember what she was so over the top angry about as I tuned her out and went back to reading my magazine (she was the only customer in the building at the time).\n\nIt all happened so fast but I hear her stomping in my direction as she is leaving and before I knew it she full on snatched my magazine right out of my hands. Like a sad little kid who just got his toy taken away I went \"Hey! That's mine! Give it back!\" She then proceeds to say that \"No! I will not give it back! Ask your MANAGER to buy you a new one!\" I then asked her again to please give it back and she shouted \"NO! ITS MINE NOW!\"\n\nWhat the actual hell lady?! Never had I been treated in such a way. My manager told me how sorry he was and that he would get me another magazine. I told him that wouldn't be necessary. Now I was a straight up goody goody when I was a kid/teen (my whole life pretty much). I NEVER did anything remotely bad for fear of getting into trouble... but Betty ignited something in me. When I got off of work, I went to my local grocery store, headed straight for the magazine aisle, and spent just over an hour opening each one and taking out the removable cards you fill out to subscribe to said magazine, and once done, brought them all home (I am guessing I had close to 100 of them).\n\nNow since I had access to the dealership's customer database, I had Betty's home address and phone number (which I made note of prior to going to the store). I spent another hour or two filling out each card with her name and address and was sure to check the \"bill me later\" box for a 12 month subscription on each. I got multiple magazines for EVERY category you can think of, Fashion, Pop Culture, Outdoors, LGBTQ, Crafting, Fitness, Cooking, Sports, Guns n Ammo, African American, Latino American, Teeny Bopper, Traveling, Auto Racing, you name it I got it. The next day, I dropped them all in one of those community USPS collection drop boxes that was on my way to work.\n\nStill to this day I wonder what happened as we never saw Betty after that. I was just hopeful that Betty got all the magazines she truly deserved.\n\nTLDR: A nasty customer came into my work and yanked my magazine right out of my hands as she was leaving. So on her behalf I filled out subscription cards for nearly 100 different magazines with her information and put them in the mail subscribing her to hundreds of dollars worth of periodicals.",

That way if you stay together then every month he gets a reminder of his gift from you at Christmas. And if things don't work out, then every month he gets a reminder that you're not together.\" She looked at me, smiled, and said \"I like the way you think.\"",

He came back over the weekend, walked halfway down the hall, then turned back and walked up to my desk. He said You bitch, it was you wasnt it! I started laughing. He said he was thinking about going to the home that was offering a free tv. And the funeral home that offered \"drive thru\" services as they were in a bank building!

Columbia House info, Dr Seuss books, weight gain supplement programs, insurance quotes - every and any thing. **BUT**, you had to be able to explain why you thought they needed it.  My roommate signed me up for something obnoxious, probably religion based as I was the only one us that was even mildly religious. So, I signed her up for \"Hooked on Phonics\". At first she was just pissed off and didn't realize it was from me. I finally told her it was from me as she'd been struggling in a class that semester and I was worried maybe she couldn't actually read (I didn't really think that). There was a 2 second pause while her eyebrows shot up to the moon, then our other roommate and I lost it. We laughed harder over that informative intro materials box than we did over any of the others. I still think back and laugh about \"Anne\" not being able to read.\nEdit: grammar",

    "postText": "So a bit of back story... a few years ago we had a couple buy the house two up from us in our street. They did renovations for the first couple of months, 7 days a week from 6am. As annoying as it is being woken up on Sunday mornings by a power saw, my fiance and I know that if you live near people your gonna hear noise so we just rolled with it. Everything changed after the reno's were finished. The guy went back to work on night shift.\nAll of a sudden our street had to be silent during the day so he could sleep.\n\nThis self entitled cunt went to great lengths to get his beauty sleep. He called the police for noise complaints any chance he got. My hippy neighbours who had their weekly afternoon jam session with acoustic guitars, my Vietnamese neighbours and their god awful Thursday afternoon karaoke and then it was my turn.\n \nComplaint after complaint went in to the council about noise from my dogs and chickens. He would walk to my front fence wait for my dog to bark at him then record it and send it to council. Then he discovered my dog was controlled, ie not allowed out of my yard without a leash. One day I left the gate open to bring shopping in, Cunty McFuckface filmed my dog walk 3 metres out of my yard to the car, sent it to council and I received an $800 fine in the mail. \n\nThat was the last straw. \nSince I'm a builder I have access to lots of noisy shit, grinders, chainsaws, metal cut off saws etc. Since I own my own company it's not always necessary for me to be onsite. I waited for him to get home, gave him an hour to get comfortable then began cutting rebar with a 2 stroke cut off saw in my front yard in 50mm sections. It took all of 15 minutes before he burst out of his house with his cranky pants on. I couldn't keep a straight face as I told him I was quite within my rights to do work around the house during the day, just as he had. Then I told him I'd had weeks of work to do so I'd better get back to it. The look on his face brought me the purest joy I've ever felt. I'd give him 30 mins to settle in the start cutting again for 10-15 minutes. Chainsaws, powersaws, didn't matter what I cut because it was all going in the bin anyway.\n\nIt was only a couple of weeks before I got bored and ran out of shit to cut but in that time I took every single opportunity I could to drive that arsehole to insanity.",

They just kept calling at 10am and leaving messages. This would not have been so bad except it was before cell phones, so every time they called the phone would ring 5-6 times and then the message would be taken by the machine.  With the old machines you could hear who was on the phone and what their message was. \n\nEvery day for a week this damn guy would call at 10am. After the second day we decided that we did not want to rent from them since they were getting pushy and couldn't follow simple instructions. So I started to call them back from work in the middle of the night. Mostly since my lunch hour at 2am was the \"first time I was able to return their call.\" Took 2 phone calls before they got the message. Then when they finally called at 4pm I told them we were not interested in the unit.",

Both directed at the day sleeper's house. Since it's ultrasound, it won't be audible to anyone else, but when the two signals converge at his home, they auto-demodulate and the audible signal drops out so he hears it, but can't tell where it's coming from. Once he leaves the house he won't hear it, and so long as it's turned off before the police turn up, anything he records as proof won't be actual proof and he'll quickly begin to think he's going insane.\n\nThen just get creative as to what the audible signal should be. Construction noise, loud music, dogs barking, children's programmes, [psychological manipulation](https://xkcd.com/440/). The options are many!",

He would:\n\n* use our bins instead of his own a few steps away.\n* steal our water.\n* kick over the stuff our landlord left in the front yard (pile of bricks shaped like a pyramid). I know it's him because the day we moved out, it had magically rearranged itself into a pyramid.\n* throw weeds into our yard.\n* wash stuff (like paint) into our driveway.\n* park in front of our driveway for up to an hour.\n* play music with heavy bass so loudly that stuff in my house would shake. I recorded it at over 100db once. Never at night thankfully but he would work odd hours (go out at 6am and come back at 8am, play music until 4pm) so it was unpredictable.\n* blow leaves into my yard and the other neighbour's yard. Blow leaves away from their car tyres and onto the walkway. EVERY SINGLE DAY even when it was drizzling.\n* suspect they got rid of a council tree because one day it just... vanished? They also kept bumping another one (young one) with their car until it started leaning sideways.\n* threw away our stuff that got blown into their house when the wind was really strong one day. Suspect he also stole one of our packages but no proof on that.\n* rev motorcycles with modified exhausts (aka really LOUD) at 6am. Saw him fly by the house way way way above the speed limit once after doing some mods in his garage.\n* park stuff in front of our house. Not illegal but park them in front of your own? One of them was also an illegal 14 ton box truck. He kept blocking the walkway too so everyone had to walk on his grass which he then got mad at them for. So they walked on the road.\n* come up to my yard and bark at my dog to make her bark. We heard him bragging about buying a dog whistle too.\n* had guests over many times during lockdown.\n* icing on the cake - my landlord gave him a copy of our garage key and he opened our door one day while I was at home. I know its him because I heard him walking next to the house right after and when we asked, he said he could give us his CCTV but he never did. He's also friends with our landlord so wasn't hard to figure out. Also started calling us rude for not coming over when he first moved in (during covid lockdown).\n\nThe neighbour on the other side told us he's a renter! That somehow makes a lot of renos (garage totally overhauled, CCTVs, paint, new turf, etc). They moved out shortly after we did.",

It was raised in 2x4s on this side, so it was 4 inches of the ground.  They'd pull into the road, and over and over and over, they'd try jump flips, and that ramp would boom when they'd land in it, and much life when the skateboard would hit it on its side. It drove me nuts, I wore ear plugs for years. \n\nWe had a dog, before bed around for my wife, about 11pm she let him out to pee. If he heard something he'd barked once or twice before, my wife would drag him in. \n\nWhat does dip stick next door do? Leans over the fence when we were out on the weekend. Oh, there you are, doggy, boy. You sure do bark a lot all night long when we're trying to sleep. I hope you stop doing that. \n\nReally? A couple of quick barks are enough for you to pull that stunt? When you know I work nights?\n\nWell, guess who started working nights?  Then the ramp gets taken away from his kids because now he knows just how loud they are and how impossible it is to sleep with that going on. \n\nWell, it's about then. I stopped working nights and took up noisy chores right when I figured he'd be trying to sleep. \n\nWhen he leaned over the fence the next time to complain about the noise, I said, \"I know, it can be hard to sleep with noise from people. Kinda like the last 3 years with your kids and that noisy ramp you made them. It's funny how that ramp disappeared really quickly when you started working nights, isn't it? \" Then I said, \"But that's OK. That's just what happens when you have neighbors, right?\"",

I refer to it as the Chihuahua Symphony. \n\nI never claimed anyone had to be quiet while I slept, because I am prescribed sedatives to help me sleep. \n\nAs for your neighbor, get a drum set or an electric guitar with an amp and invite the neighbor kids (or nieces and nephews, if you have them) over to practice. Aim the amp towards numbnuts house.",

No dog is ever \u201ccontrolled\u201d without prior violent behavior and I guarantee his dog probably injured someone before. Only explanation for the police actually issuing fines for this.",

The Brisbane City Council found me at no fault for what happened however since another animal had been injured bylaws required that Bundy be declared menacing, not dangerous. \n\nAlso, the incident I described in my post happened 8 years later. Unfortunately, where I live once a dog is declared menacing it sticks for life. Regardless of the fact that that was the one and only time she had ever shown aggression towards animals let alone humans. \nThe guy also complained about the noise my 4 hens made after they laid an egg! How was I supposed to raise them better you fucking idiot. \n\nWhen you know shit, you speak shit. \n\nThere's a lesson for you there.",

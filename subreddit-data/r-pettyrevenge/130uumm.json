    "postText": "This wasn't done by me, but fits in with your post. I submitted this a while back as a comment to a post, but was told I should make it a separate submission. \n\nI work at a Lowes, and even though the signs say no pets, people bring in their dogs and no one says anything. One day a woman and her teenaged son came in with a little dog, and the dog took a dump in the aisle. When the kid pointed it out to his mom, she told him not to worry, because the store employees are paid to clean it up. I came back a couple minutes later with the clean up equipment, and a customer told me he would take care of it. I assumed it was her husband at first, but he told me he's her neighbor and that he's been cleaning up after that \"F-ing rodent\" in his yard for years. \n\nAbout half an hour later, after checking out, the woman came back into the store screaming that someone had smeared dog poop all over her windshield and front side windows, demanding that management find the employee responsible by watching the video recording, and make him or her clean her car. I told the store manager what had happened and he went back to the woman and told her that the parking lot camera had been damaged by weather, and she was on her own. He did offer to let her use the clean up equipment that I had returned to the janitor's closet. \n\nLater, he and I, on the PC in his office, watched the neighbor walk out to her car wearing rubber gloves and carrying a paper towel bundle, laughing our heads off as he coated the windshield and windows.",

I call bullshit, considering other petroleum distillates, such as butane, are toxic. (And then more edit for spelling mistakes, jeez)",

I imagine he's talked and made calls but nothing has worked, and with her attitude, nothing 'nice' would make a difference to her.\n\nI can just feel the immense satisfaction in his soul when he realized he could enact his revenge, and pulled it off without a hitch. AND the employees got to watch said revenge when the shit hit the fan, I mean, windshield. This is awesome!",

We were booked at the local fairgrounds.\n\nGetting ready, we would select dogs, take them for a brief walk to hopefully do their business, briefly socialize them with each other, and then drive to the venue.\n\nFor some (ultimately poorly thought out reason) the venue placed us in the middle of this huge indoor area. We get set up and I decide to take my dog outside for another walk. On the looonngg way to the exit, the dog begins shitting all over the new carpet, and is the type of dog who likes to walk around in a big circle while doing it. Horrible.\n\nI'm mortified and trying to dab at the not very firm poo with my one or two doggy bags (this is a trash can bag sized poo) and trying to get the dog outside to maybe get some poo out there instead of on the new carpets.\n\nThe fairgrounds folks were pretty nice about it outwardly and there was a whole team of them trying to clean this up. It needed industrial equipment, not my tiny poo bags.\n\nThe dog had a good day and got some treats, a bit of attention, and some time outside the shelter.\n\nPlease adopt and save some other fairgrounds from a poocapolypse.",

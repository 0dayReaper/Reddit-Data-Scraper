    "postText": "I ended up at a party with a guy I had a one night stand with and his girlfriend\n\nSo a few years ago I(26F at the time) was invited by my friend (35M at the time) to his gf house for a party/get together. I went and was having a good time drinking and meeting new people. When I got there I noticed a hot guy, my interest quickly turned to \"never-mind\" when I saw him sitting on the couch talking to another girl that I later learned was invited to the party intentionally to introduce the two of them. I'm not about competing for a guy or stealing one. \nAt one point we were introduced and I learned it was my friend's girlfriend's nephew. (For the record he was the same age as me and my friend's girlfriend was in her 30s but yes he was her nephew and he was my age) \n\nAs the party winded down and most people left it left me, my friend, his gf, nephew(hot guy), other girl and a couple other people. We decided to play Cards against humanity. We play that for awhile and all have a good time and I don't quite remember how it came up but I ended up saying something along the lines of \"I give really good back massages\" not in a sexual way but a statement in conversation. We played a round then everyone else left and it left me, hot guy and my friend+gf. I overheard hot guy telling my friend he wasnt interested in that other girl as she seemed boring. \n\nThat's when he turned his interest to me. It was obvious. He asked if I wanted another shot and we did shots together and started chatting. He jokingly asks \"so when am I gonna get one of your really good back massages?\" I laughed and probably blushed idk I was drunk. He continued to flirt with me. I ended up texting my friend asking if he was fair game (with him being his gfs nephew i didnt want her hating me if I ended up sleeping with him) he essentially gave me the green light and I carried on talking with him and flirting. Friend+gf disappeared to the bedroom leaving me and him alone in the living room. We did end up sleeping together and fell asleep on the couch together. It was obvious in the morning what had happened. No issues with friends gf, she didn't care aside from jokingly giving him a hard time. I was in between chalking it up to a one night stand and actually liking him.\n\n About a week later we were messaging on FB and he invited me to a party they were having for his birthday that night and when I said I could stop by and tried to get the address then dude straight up ghosted me. I brushed it off and let it go. I did tell my friend what happened not in an upset way he just asked if I was talking to him still. He said he was sorry but I told him not biggie I knew it was probably gonna be a one night stand anyway. \n\nFast forward to a couple months later my friend again invites me to a party but this time at another friend of his house. I said I'd come then he told me hot guy would be there and asked if I was ok with that. I told him it didn't bother me at all. So I went. \nWithin 30 seconds of me walking in the door hot guy notices me and  comes up to me to give me a hug. He's already drunk. I'm nice but not flirty but he's flirting with me. At one point my friend pulls me aside to tell me to be careful cuz hot guy has a girlfriend now and she was on her way and his gf happens to be my friend's gf's best friend. I tell him not to worry I'm not even interested in him anymore. He said ok and he just wanted me to know. \n\nHe continues to flirt with me while I'm not even responding with the slightest amount of flirting which seems to make him try harder. About 20 min later his gf shows up. Of course he's all \"hi baby how was work?\" When she gets there. *insert eye roll here*\n\nMy friend introduces me to her and thats when the fun begins. Her and I became instant friends for the night. Doing shots together and laughing and just having a good time all while her boyfriend watched with confusion as his gf and his previous one night stand he ghosted paid more attention to eachother than to him. It was my little bit of petty revenge for being ghosted and then flirted with while dating someone else. I still to this day laugh and have a sense of satisfaction when I think about it.",

While I did know he was going to be there what I did NOT know was he would be drunk already, that he would be flirting with me as if nothing happened, or that his new girlfriend would be coming. \n\nHer and I hitting it off just sorta happened.....so I rolled with it. Once she took a liking to me that's when I thought, I'm gonna make this girl my best friend for the night and if possible steal all her attention and make it as awkward and confusing for him as possible. And it worked and we had a lot of fun while he sat there in his drunken confusion lol",

I wasn't after him, it happened before they dated, I did not want to ruin anyone's night or possibly their relationship and it wasn't my obligation or business to tell her. That was on him. If someone else closer to her or he wanted to disclose that info, by all means go ahead. Or if her BFF wanted to let her know about his flirting with me just before she showed up...go ahead. I had nothing to hide cuz I didn't match his flirting. I had zero issues with her so why say something that in my position could look like an attempt to steal her man and cause who knows what kind of drunken madness. I just wanted to have a good time, show I wasn't a threat, make him feel awkward AF and move on with my life. \nNo unfortunately we did not keep in touch. Soon after that night my friend and his gf had one of their many breakups and since I was friends with him a friendship with the on again off again gfs BFF didn't seem like a dynamic I wanted to be in. I avoid drama as you can see. Maybe we can be friends in the next life.",

Idk remember the context cuz it was like 4 years ago...maybe 5 and I was drunk, it may have had some sexual context but it wasn't directed at him it or anyone it was a comment I made during the game to the group. \nHIS comment later asking me when he could get one of my \"really good back massages\" when just him and I were talking, yes that was a sexual move on his part.",

You don\u2019t do that to another woman just to get back at the guy and literally only just cover for him in the end. Revenged would have been telling this girl they slept together and he was literally flirting with her 20mins before she got there. Op did nothing worthwhile here, this guys gets to go home happy with his gf. Thinking \u201cnice that op will cover for me and even gets along w my gf!!:)\u201d",

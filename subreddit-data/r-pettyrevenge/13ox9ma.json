    "postText": "I work at the same place as my sister. It is a very large building and you can park in the back, front or the side parking lot. There are over 700 people that work in the building and we are divided into different office \u201cunits\u201d. The unit I work in is on the same side of the building as my sisters and we both park in the side parking lot since it is closer to our office. \n\nThe building is open from 6am to 6pm. Before Covid I always worked 6-2:30pm (for years). Because I worked so early I always got the best (closest) parking spot in the side lot (again for years). Then when Covid happened I worked from home for 2 years. \n\nThis is about A, she works in the same unit as my sister. While I was working from home, A started parking where I did since she didn\u2019t have the option to work remotely. She parked there until mid 2022 which is when everyone had to come back to the office. I once again parked in the spot where I always parked because I am always there first. \n\nWell my first day back A complains to my sister how someone \u201ctook her spot\u201d. She does not have an assigned spot. My sister already knew she was talking about me since she always sees my car there and knows A has been parking there. A went off ranting about how someone had the nerve to park in her spot (again not assigned) and my sister said nothing.She was upset because she got there early at 5:55am and someone took her spot. I guess she thinks no one parks until the exact time they are supposed to be at the office \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nMy sister tells me about this. I do not like A for a lot of reasons. She is like a Karen for one thing. She also does less than the bare minimum so everyone else in that unit has to do more work to pick up the slack. My sister mostly. And A had even taken my sisters work and took credit for it. \n\nWhat did I do? I leave home even earlier the next morning. I usually leave at 5:30 and would get there at 5:50. I left at 5:25 and got there at 5:45. A had complained again how she got there even earlier and someone was parked in her spot again. My sister tells me about A\u2019s plan to leave even earlier the next day. So I leave earlier too lol. The next day I go there at 5:40. I don\u2019t mind leaving earlier because there is less traffic. \n\nIf she didn\u2019t make such a big deal about it being her spot I wouldn\u2019t care. I mean parking one car over isn\u2019t making you walk that much further. But still. I don\u2019t want her to park there because of her entitled attitude and well mostly because I know it bothers her. So there is more. \n\nI usually have a lot of dr appointments. I typically like going in the morning and coming to work afterwards. Instead I started scheduling all my appointments in the afternoon so I could park in that spot before A. \n\nBut wait. There is more. I was then given the option of work from home a few days a week. I was told I could choose any days I wanted. At this point A was also able to work from home a few days as well. So what did I do? I asked my sister which days A comes into the office. So I made those my office days too lol. And if I need to be late for an appointment I now schedule it in the morning on one of As work from home days. \n\nIt gives me great joy when I leave work and see her parked on the other side of me in her not parking spot lol. She still complains someone has been parking in her spot for over a year now lol.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add my sister may be getting an assigned parking space which will be in the space I park now (she has a higher position and one of the few that gets a parking space). I told her if she has any leeway to chose where I park now so then I can start parking where A has been parking since I\u2019ve come back to the office. \n\nETA: TL;DR a coworker got mad I parked in a parking space she claims is her when it isn\u2019t assigned so I\u2019ve been going out of my way to leave early and park there so that she can\u2019t",

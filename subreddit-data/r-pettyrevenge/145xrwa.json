    "postText": "This is gonna be fairly short, but I think it will still make some people giggle. \n\nNow anyone who has been in a long term relationship knows sometimes your partner just annoys you. It\u2019s nothing serious, you still love each other but something\u2019s still get on your nerves. \n\nNow my husband of 10 years likes to listen to the playlist Apple Music made for him based on his interests, while working from home. He also has his Apple Music account hooked up to all the google speakers in the house. At one point we realized that what I listen to via the speakers sometimes shows up on his list, but also random stuff none of us listened too. \n\nSo now whenever he goes on my nerves or I\u2019m mad at him, I will play the most unhinged crap music via one of the speakers on the low volume for hours, so that the apple algorithm thinks he\u2019s interested in it and will mix it into his playlist. It annoys him and so far he hasn\u2019t figured out it\u2019s me, because of course this doesn\u2019t happen directly after we bicker. \n\nIt probably shouldn\u2019t bring me as much joy as it does. And for everyone who doesn\u2019t have a sense of humor, rest assured I love this man too pieces and it\u2019s not that serious \ud83d\ude02",

It's so bad I have to take a breath and force myself to \"play it cool\" while I open that jar for her. Just makes me feel like the most successful strong man on the planet and that look she gives when I open the jar gives me butterflies even after 10 years of being together.\n\nIt's not a sexual thing, more of an annoyed at how easy it was for me/proud of me for doing it for her. I am fairly certain she knows this and has me open things she could handle just to make my day and I am not mad about it lol.",

I can't remember what got me so worked up, but I got hot and rolled my sleeves up. Still remember being looked at like a piece of meat and being so confused that the reason I was upset has been forgotten. I have bought more of there plaid shirts.\n\nHonestly, if you want to buy an awesome gift for a guy Dixon is the place to go. There shirts are incredible and unique color prints that they release in batches and don't duplicate. My brother gets me a new one every Christmas and I am always happy lol. The wife practically drooling is a bonus!",

They live in a small house, but she and her husband hadn't heard it, and didn't believe him. Cut to one night and she wakes up and hears it . . . \"I'm Too Sexy\" by Right Said Fred.\n\nWe are all cracking up because it's just so damn funny, but they can't figure out WHY this is happening. I happened to be out for drinks with my boyfriend, who is pretty good with all things tech. He gives me instructions for her to drill down on her speaker - I can't remember what kind - and they find it set up to play every night!\n\nBut WHO did this? No one has been at the house recently, they have no idea. A couple of days later, she's at work and talking to her mom about it. They owned a small business together, and their very quiet, shy tech guy was there working on an issue. As they were talking, she looked over and he was furiously blushing all the way up to his ears! She asked if he knew anything and he confessed! He had helped her with an issue MONTHS ago, and he'd set it up as a prank, thinking they'd hear it the next night. He'd been waiting and waiting and gave up. Meanwhile, her son was getting traumatized by the scary song lol. I need to check with her to see if he still hates it!",

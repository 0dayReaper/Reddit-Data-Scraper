    "postText": "So ever since myself and my partner moved into our home back in December we have noticed our next door neighbours are interesting characters. I can only describe the house as a half way house. \n\nThey aren\u2019t exactly pleasant people to live next to but all of it can be tolerated with our bedroom being on the opposite side to them. \n\nBUT\n\nThe one thing I cannot stand is instead of lifting the peg on their big metal driveway gate, they scrape it the entire time along the gravel and concrete. \n\nI wish I was exaggerating when I say it is so stupidly loud, and usually happens anywhere between 5-7am and then again at 10-11pm at night. And there is less than 5 metres between this gate and our house. \n\nI have tried talking to them about it and they\u2019re always like yeah no worries we will from now on but IT KEEPS HAPPENING. \n\nSo every now and again when I see their car leave I will sneak between the hedges and shut the gate. \nJust to inconvenience them. \n\nI know for a fact that none of the neighbours have cameras because we know them well. \nThe day I see a camera appear I will stop, but for now if they wanna wake me up every morning I\u2019m gonna keep inconveniencing them.",

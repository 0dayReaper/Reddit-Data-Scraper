    "postText": "This story takes place my 3rd year of college. I was taking a class where the entire grade was determined by a semester long final project. We were supposed to be in groups of three on the project, but the third guy in our group had more sense than me and bailed early. This left just me and Lazy Girl hereafter known as LG.\n\nLG didn\u2019t do anything the entire semester. I would ask her to work on pieces of the project, but she always had an excuse for why it wasn\u2019t done yet (or in her case started).\n\nNow I didn\u2019t want any confrontation with this girl, as she was my friend at the time, but I finally lost it one night towards the end of the semester. I\u2019d asked her to meet at my house to work on the project, but \u2018something important came up.\u2019  \n\nFed up with this one sided partnership, I decided to air my woes at the local bars. And guess who I run into? and LG and her boyfriend drinking! She made up some bullshit excuse and I made a plan.\n\nI powered through the entire assignment, except for the conclusion which I asked LG to finish. I held out exactly zero hope that she would finish this section, so I quickly finished it myself and turned in my project with a little note to the teacher.\n\nThe note detailed how I had done literally everything for the project and that despite my best efforts, I could not get LG to contribute. I said that I was turning in my version and that Our conclusions section may differ as I\u2019d asked her to actually do that part herself.\n\nSo here\u2019s a little tidbit about our final projects, we each had to turn one in. LG here not only didn\u2019t do the conclusion, she didn\u2019t turn in a project at all!\n\nShe tried calling and bitching at me for not \u2018giving her credit\u2019 to which I went off on her for not doing shit on the entire project. I mentioned how I even gave her the opportunity to turn in my work for a grade if she\u2019d only do ONE thing! She hung up after that, and that was the last time we spoke. \n\nTLDR: Girl spends the entire semester screwing around thinking I\u2019ll do the project for her. I do 90% of the project for her, and she still fails because she couldn\u2019t even turn it in.",

One of my buddies basically carried the entire team of five, two of them did no work and the other only did a bit. Major shit-show. Much rage and drama.\n\nMe? I dodged a bullet. The next year I grouped up with four other guys I'd never met until  the first lecture of the year. Everyone worked hard, we all pulled our weight, got decent marks all year and had a good experience with it. We were never super-close friends but I did keep in regular contact with a couple of them for years after Uni. Good guys. Sometimes it pays not to group up with friends.",

Two guys who mostly speak Chinese but were good guys and me. I ask them multiple times what we are working on and they tell me they have it and they will let me know what they want me to do. I design a bunch html pages and do all the css to make them look decent and give them over. They say they are having some trouble getting everything to work but will have a friend help them.\n\nI get to class on presentation day.

First time assigning groups is pretty random,  he finds out real quick who are the workers and who are slackers, each group project after that he reassigns the workers together and slackers together, by the last project the worst are together and the best are together. He says it always makes for a good time at the end of the semester.",

I feel like I\u2019m missing a part of the argument that side steps this.  But in essence the sexual favor was mutually agreed on and benefitted both, therefore it was morally just.  \n\nSo never did he explicitly say that he would make the offer but there was an awkward sense that this was indeed what he was making clear.

Your CEO doesn't just have the whole company at the same level below him and hand out projects saying \"figure it out dummies\". Projects make their way down through VPs, to managers, to leads, and then divvied up until a portion of a project lands on your desk.\n\nIn 4 years of uni, doing group projects, I only had ONE group project that was anything like the work force. The prof gave us groups, and he split the projects into 4 \"jobs\" and each person was graded on their individual part, plus the result of the entire project. \n\nEverything else is lord of the fucking flies without a work delegation and management system like this, and absolutely not at all how the real world works.

Decided to take an online software engineering class this semester, since I work on automating QA for a company. How hard could it be? Well 50% of our grade was a 4 person group project that required full documentation (requirement docs, team breakdown, roles, design documentation, etc) and we had 4 months to do it. \n\nIt would easily be a 4 person 4 month job, so I immediately reached out to the other 3 members. They all lived on campus, while I lived an hour away, and my 9 to 5 is an hour away from my house in the opposite direction.  After a month of little to no response from anyone, I arranged a meet up on campus. All three agreed, 2 showed up late, and one never did (I never heard from them again). \n\nAfter a 2 hour meeting where we made some actual progress, I asked everyone to upload their resume that night to a doc (not sure why that was a requirement but it was) figuring it would be the simplest thing to knock out. Apparently having a full working resume by your senior year of college was too much to ask, and they said they would make one that week. \n\nTwo weeks of reminders and no resumes later, I emailed the professor detailing my experience, stating that given that I worked full time doing the entire project myself at that point wasn't feasible, and asking if there was anything I could do. I got a canned response about how group projects were meant to teach students how to get over communication issues in the workplace and that she believed in us. I told her I was dropping her class. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, i'm still a little salty about that experience. ",

I can't get on the last day to respond, but can the day after.  I told the instructor that I felt I was at a disadvantage since my post is up for them to have something to post a response to, yet I have to respond to them but they are not posting soon enough to meet my schedule.  So far the instructor has worked with me if I get on the next day, but who knows how long that will last if they think I am abusing the system.\n\nWe still have a final to do which is a group project, and 6 varying topics, one assigned to each group... I asked the instructor when and how groups would be chosen, and they responded that it would be the week before it is due, and they chose the members of a group.  So I either start work on 6 separate topics to ensure I pull my weight, or Scramble at the very end and hope that I get set up with a group who is not lazy, and willing/able to get things done early.

We were supposed to team up on twos and make a stage decor piece that looks like a real life huge mushroom, and it had to be strong enough to be sat on. It required a lot of styrofoam cutting and building it around a stool, then finishing it with glue soaked fabric and paint. This girl i was teamed up with showed up once. Unfortunately that one time i managed to accidentally cut myself and faint. They sent me home that day. All the other hours i spent making this thing on my own. I called her every time, in front of the teacher, and she would never have an excuse other than 'i am not going to be there'. In the end we were required to grade eichother. Gave her 2 out of 10.  She refused to grade me, she was fuming. Said i had no empathy for her. She never even explained what i was supposed to be empathic about. Teacher ended up grading me instead. Her grade was not changed.",

I was going to move to kick her out of the group if she didn't show up at the library where the rest of us were working. She dropped the course. ",

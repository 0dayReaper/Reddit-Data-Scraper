    "postText": "I am a hairstylist and I work for myself now. Prior I worked at a well known salon/shop chain. I worked with a group of younger stylists and receptionists. I am a busy stylist and  always booked out. I\u2019ve been doing hair for 24 years now so I\u2019m well established. We had a fun loving group, and most of the people I worked with were much younger than me and most of them were my eldest child\u2019s age or younger. So in some ways I always felt on the outside of the group because of the age difference, I was raising one kid still at home and couldn\u2019t be out after work having cocktails with them for outside of work bonding time. Nor did I really want to because I am not a huge drinker.\n\nAnyway, one Saturday I was working with the receptionist in question and I saw an attractive person. I whispered to the receptionist and said, \u201cLook at that person, they are so good looking, don\u2019t the look like so and so?\u201d She said, \u201cWhere?\u201d We went back and forth a few times. She didn\u2019t see who I was talking about and I was trying not to be obvious. Then I touched the side of her head and gently pointed her to the person. I said, \u201cTherrrrrrre.\u201d She got really angry and said, \u201cGet off me. Don\u2019t touch me.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you.\u201d I was confused because I thought we were having fun. I did interrupt her counting change, I guess but I thought we had at least a friendly playful relationship because of previous talks and interactions with her. \n\nThat was a Saturday, I had the next few days off and when I came back to work, she\u2019d spread a rumor that I\u2019d assaulted her. Luckily for me, two long term co-workers that I\u2019d worked with off and on since 2004 told her after she recounted her story to them, that that was not assault and to stop spreading lies. They were friends with her and still are today, as they are with me.\n\nIt became this huge thing and I had to, the day after my days off and I went back to work- I had to recount what happened to my manager and my very first manager who was now working in the main office a Director, thankfully knew my character and my work ethic. He said not to worry and that nothing was going to happen and it was a matter of protocol to hear her out. She\u2019d been vying for time off coincidentally but said she\u2019d been suffering from migraines since the incident (she also, had gotten new glasses the day prior to the incident). \n\nInevitably nothing happened, she got her days off and within a few months, I quit my job and opened my own shop. However, one of the last days I worked she said to me, \u201cI\u2019m an artist, if you ever need art for your walls let me know, I\u2019d be happy to hang my art in your shop.\u201d I couldn\u2019t do or say anything because I was in shock. Could she not remember what she\u2019d just put me through and said about me? Did she forget that she told everyone I assaulted her?\n\nFast forward, I\u2019ve never worked with this woman again. I haven\u2019t even run into her over the years at any restaurant or public place but I have heard of her through an old co-worker. They remain friends and bbq, go to bars and spend time together.\n\nToday I got a text from a friend who is also a mother. Our boys have gone to school together since Kindergarten and they\u2019re just finishing up their Freshman year of school. I do their hair and occasionally I pick up their daughter because she is running late to college and instead of catching the bus from our neighborhood, I take her to the transit center and then she\u2019s not late. The daughter is also a house/dog sitter and she\u2019ll be staying at our house in a few weeks watching things around the house for us and the pets.\n\nThe text this morning said: \n\nHi! By chance do you know of a M_____ Z_____? I am interviewing her and noticed she says she works at your \u2018old salon\u2019 currently, since 2013 in reception.\n\nI called her back and told said, \u201cWhy yes I do\u201d. I told her the whole story. I said I don\u2019t trust her and she was also lazy. She could do the work but aside from her accusations she wasn\u2019t the best receptionist I\u2019d ever worked with\u201d. I said, \u201cI think it could be problematic, especially if she was in your very small business office but do I think she could do the actual job, probably and she\u2019s probably matured since I worked with her last but I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s my experience of her.\u201d\n\nMy friend immediately said, \u201cOh no, I\u2019d be her boss. We don\u2019t do drama, backstabbing or bad vibes here. Thank you for that information. I knew if there were any issues you would tell me the truth. I appreciate it.\u201d\n\n\nSo the interview was today. No hire. They didn\u2019t hire her. The moral of the story is, be nice and don\u2019t lie because memories are long and we remember how people treat us and make us feel. She\u2019ll never know how her actions effected me but it certainly has made me more aware that everyone is not your friend and unless we have a rapport, I would never playfully touch anyone without their consent ever again. I also would never accuse someone of something they didn\u2019t do just to be vindictive and try to ruin them as I spread a fictitious story that never happened. \n\nDid I forget to say, there were cameras that captured everything that happened with audio? I didn\u2019t did I? Well much to her chagrin, there was camera evidence of all of it.  What she said, was proven to be a lie but she forgot about the cameras. It was also on a busy Saturday with clients in the waiting room and at the front desk. Every chair full with clients and hairstylists doing hair. Nobody saw a thing. Nobody saw me assault her because there was no assault and just like her job offer at my friend\u2019s office, it has been rescinded. Oh look, no assault, no job.",

This has caused the business owner to run his mouth about her to everyone in the city he knows (after she got fired) and it's a small industry so she was forced to relocate.\n\nIf she owned her mistakes and didn't try to harm me it would have been rectified there and then and she would have kept her job.

As in he would pull people off of their own work to help him do his, and his would consist of what I can only describe as \u2018color by numbers\u2019 level tasks as he was too green for me to confidently assign him anything important.  \n\nI called him in for a meeting, told him pretty directly that he\u2019d been with us too long for him to still need help with tasks as simple as what he was constantly pulling people off of.  I\u2019ll admit here and now, I wasn\u2019t the nicest about it but I also wasn\u2019t demonic.  I did my best to keep it professional and not personal, to only talk about the work he was doing, but it did include a comment that he was creating more work than he was actually completing and that was not sustainable.\n\nWell, a coworker who was essentially one step below me in the hierarchy overheard part of the conversation thanks to paper thin walls, and decided to take it upon herself to talk to him right after, tell him I was being an asshole, and apologized \u201con his behalf because he\u2019s not going to, that\u2019s just who he is.\u201d  She then came and threatened to report me to HR for what I\u2019d said to him and then actually did such, telling them I was bullying the entire office.   \n\nHR got involved, I told my side, she told hers, and all hell broke loose when the new guy told HR that she\u2019d apologized on her literal boss\u2019s (and by extension the company\u2019s) behalf.  She got essentially told she\u2019s on thin ice, which shattered less than a week later when she relegated a task \u2014 that I\u2019d *in writing* given her \u2014 to new guy who still had no clue what he was doing.\n\nHe ended up completely screwing up the handling of an order and caused more than we pull in on a busy day in damages, which got all sorts of attention.  I was ready with the receipts of me emailing my coworker to handle the orders like usual, new guy had receipts of her telling him to take care of it, and in one fell swoop both were fired.  \n\nI\u2019m still baffled by how over the top she got trying to champion for this guy who I personally had received a whole stack of complaints about.  Everyone on the team wanted him gone but I lacked the authority to directly fire, I could only recommend him for a performance review.  Had she not tried so hard to champion for him after my meeting, she probably wouldn\u2019t have given him the task that ended up getting them both fired.  Really felt like she was trying to prove to us all that he just needed more responsibilities that everyone else in the room knew he could not handle.",

There's a book I read that I recommend to others any chance I get called **Extreme Ownership** by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. It's written by two Navy seals who played big ~~roles in the~~ roles in the Battle of Ramadi in Iraq while leading their teams. They go over the necessary skills required to be an effective and successful leader that they learned while in combat. They use examples from their time being deployed in Iraq to emphasise the qualities of a successful leader. Then they link it to the business world and explain how to apply what they learned on the battlefield to business, and to your own life.\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways from the book, is that you need to fully own your mistakes and learn from them if you want to be successful. Because at the end of the day, each of us is ultimately responsible for where we end up in life and shifting the blame to others won't get you very far.\n\nEDIT: typed out the same thing twice in the same sentence. Damn ADHD, I need to do a better job of proof reading before I post stuff :P",

BUT that doesn't mean giving an accuser carte Blanche. I once had a young female employee accuse an older male employee of harassment. This guy was a jovial old country boy. Always high firing everyone, smiling, shaking hands. He had a big booming voice and would always say \"hey young man/young lady!\". That kind of thing. The girl accused him of inappropriately touching her. When I reviewed the cameras, I saw that he walked next to her, greeted her, and put his hand on the upper part of her back between her shoulder blades for a half second then kept walking. I'm sorry but that's not assault or harassment. HR told me I had to write him up. I refused. I explained that I'm not putting my name on a piece of paper that will destroy a man's reputation when I don't agree. There was nothing they could really do about my refusal but they sent someone in to do the dirty work. The poor guy was literally crying. He quit a week later, and I dont blame him. Flash forward a few weeks and lo and behold we find out that the girl was stealing cash out of the till. So HR ruined a good man's reputation, lost a good sales man, and soured their relationship with me for the sake of a thief because nobody wanted to stick their neck out for what was right.",

We had a class-long \"project\" thing about something from the book and were assigned groups to discuss it in the group and then share with the class at the end. I saw others huddled up, with someone I know actually huddled like a football huddle. I made the terrible, awful, no good choice to attempt to do the same in my group with a couple people I knew and a couple of people didn't. One of the people I didn't know very well was this girl and I put my arm kinda on her shoulder (really more for show, I didn't put any weight on her really) and she freaked the fuck out and yelled \"GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF ME!\"\n\nI was shocked and immediately complied and jumped away like she'd stabbed me with her words. My intentions were purely to lean in and have a discussion, I was absolutely not trying to be weird or creepy and wasn't even looking at her when I did, but I guess I was. I was blushed beet red the rest of the day and I didn't so much as look at her the rest of the school year. I didn't speak to her either. I learned that day to never touch anyone that I didn't know very well, especially women. I learned a hard lesson that day, one I guess I needed to learn.",

He was talking, not in a lecture but just sharing a story I wanted to hear, and these 3 girls next to me were having a discussion that was in normal speaking voices and drowning out Jonesy. I glanced at them a couple of times, hoping to get the message across but they didn't chill. So I kinda stared/glared in frustration at the loudest one named Lina. Lina looked at me, and her friend Katie did too and smirked. Lina then said I stared at her like a rapist. Another girl I never looked at again and refused to be around.

It does sound like she may have over exaggerated what happened for attention. However it is still assault. If someone touched me when I hadn't concented it would result in probably a slap in the face at least. \n\nYou may have triggered a bad memory or experience for her which caused her behaviour. Not that lies are an appropriate response, but you need to remember everyone has a back story, some of which you are not privy to.",

You were openly talking about one of them to your coworker, in front of other customers, and distracting her from her work. She didn't do what you wanted her to so you grabbed her face.

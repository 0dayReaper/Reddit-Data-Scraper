    "postText": "Back in college, many decades ago, I lived off campus in a big house that had been converted to a whole bunch of individual rooms. We had one common kitchen, which we all had to share. \n\nOne evening, I made a batch of brownies that I was going to take over to my girlfriend's place. Just...regular ol' Duncan Hines brownies.  I took them out of the oven to cool for a few minutes, and went to my room to get my jacket. In the 60 seconds I was gone, half the pan got snarfed by one of my housemates, whom I'll call Cadet Doofus. He was just sitting there, brownie crumbs smeared all over his shirt and hands, and a big stupid grin on his face. He looks at me as I came back in and says \"Hur, hur, hur...was dem YOUR brownies? Dey was de-lishus!\"\n\nNow...Cadet Doofus had a reputation in our house of being a slob, a bully, a food thief, and an all-around not-too-bright person. He was 6 foot 4 and 250 pounds, none of it muscle. Nobody cared for him, but since he paid his rent on time, he couldn't be tossed. Cadet Doofus was also in the ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps), which is a college program to train students to become officers in the US military. They have some very strict rules, especially about what substances you can put into your body. \n\nOddly enough, I too had a reputation in the house, as being a regular user of the holy herb. And of being smarter than the average jarhead-wannabe. I looked at Cadet Doofus in dismay.\n\n\"You ate all my brownies!\" I shouted. The housemates in the next room watching TV looked out at us in the kitchen at my shout.\n\n\"Hur, hur, hur...Yep!\" Cadet Doofus replies, still with the stupid grin on his face as he licked his fingers.\n\n\"You owe me $2.50 for the brownie mix!\" I continued loudly.\n\n\"Hur, hur, hur...Sure, Ah'll get that to ya next week. Maybe. Or not...\"\n\n\"And...you also owe me $50 bucks for all the pot that was in those brownies!\" I shouted even louder. Cue some giggling from the the housemates in the next room.\n\n\"Hur, hur...er, what?\" \n\n\"The pot! The marijuana that was in those brownies!  You scarfed a week's supply of weed in that plate of brownies!\" I shouted back. Housemates began piling into the kitchen to watch the drama.\n\nA look of panic filled his flat, dull face. \"I can't be havin' none of that mary-jew-wana! I'll lose mah scholarship!\"\n\nI made a big show of looking at my watch. \"And it's worse than that! You've got about an hour before you start tripping balls! With the amount you ate, you're gonna be stoned for the next 2 days!\"\n\nNow Cadet Doofus looked really panicked.  \"OH NO!!! Ah've got drill instruction all day tomorrow! They're gonna know!! What do Ah do??\"\n\n\"We need to get this out of your system, and fast, before you start tripping!\"\n\nAnd with that, my housemates and I grabbed Cadet Doofus and dragged him to the bathroom, and proceeded to come up with various weird ways to make him upchuck the brownies. Glass of salt water. Finger down his throat. Tickle the back of his tongue with a spoon. Pounding him on the back (hard!). After 20 minutes, he finally returns the brownies to the porcelain throne. He sits on the bathroom floor, sweating, weeping, and shaking, and then looks up at me. \"Thanks, man, fur saving me from trippin' and gittin' stoned and losin' mah scholarship.\" Then he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a couple of twenty dollar bills. \"Here man, take this, and ah'll pay yoo back the rest next week. And ah promise not to eat yer stuff again.\"\n\nHe slowly pulled himself into an upright position and staggered back to his room. I went back to MY room, got another box of brownie mix, and made a second batch of equally delicious...and equally DRUG FREE...brownies for my girl friend. And Cadet Doofus never did steal anyone's food ever again...",

About a week later, my friend asked if I ate his candy bar, but I hadn't. So the next time I saw my boyfriend (he works nights, up until about the time I'm waking up in the morning, then sleeps until work, so I don't see him often), I asked if he knew where the candy bar went. Mind you, my boyfriend is 110 pounds, and only a cigarette smoker. No drugs or even alcohol. Yup, he ate it. I asked how it went for him since it was an edible. I guess it explained a lot lol. He said he was watching a movie and just couldn't concentrate on it, had to keep rewinding it. So he went out for a smoke. Still felt off. We live on the second floor of an apartment building. He *passed out* half way up the stairs and I guess slept there for over two hours. I was dying. He never has grabbed another random candy bar since!",

He saved two for himself, which he left on the kitchen counter when he went out that day.\n\nHis mother called him later that day to tell him that his father, who was the president of a medium sized corporation, had went to work but later committed himself to a mental hospital.\n\nYup, he took the two pot brownies to work and ate them after lunch.  My friend went to the hospital to tell his dad.  After finding out he really wasn\u2019t going insane, the dad was overjoyed to learn the truth.  He discharged himself and took the family out for Chinese food.",

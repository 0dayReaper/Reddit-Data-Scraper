    "postText": "I have dwarfism, and this often leads to weird interactions in public, especially with kids. Sometimes a kid comes up to me to ask me why I\u2019m so short, and I have a pre-prepared response for that, but most of the time they just loudly ask their parents why I\u2019m so short. Usually the parents will awkwardly drag their kids away, telling them not to comment on people in public, which is sad but understandable. I like the parents who just say something about how some people are born like this, and even though we look a bit different we\u2019re still regular people just like everyone else. Sometimes I hear a gem like \u201cI bet he shrank in the wash\u201d.\n\nWhat I can\u2019t stand is when people try to use me to parent their kids. I\u2019m sure you can think of ways to convince your kids to finish their plate at dinner that don\u2019t involve pointing at a dwarf in public and saying \u201cthat\u2019s what happens when you leave food on your plate\u201d or \u201che didn\u2019t listen to his mommy when she told him to eat all his vegetables\u201d. It\u2019s rude, it\u2019s humiliating, and it teaches your kid that differences are a bad thing and that people are at fault for their differences or disabilities. It just pisses me off.\n\nA few days ago I was in public and a kid who was maybe 4 or 5 years old was acting out, and his mom was clearly struggling to keep him under control. So she pointed to me and told her son that I was one of Santa\u2019s elves, and I was watching him and would tell Santa about his behavior. The kid\u2019s name was on a key ring on his backpack so I just said \u201cit\u2019s ok Hunter, you\u2019re already on the nice list, and Santa told me you\u2019re getting an iPad this Christmas.\u201d Hunter was excited. His mom was not.",

But your uterus doesn\u2019t know whether or not it\u2019s going to need to have a baby in it soon, so when you get a little older it will decide to start getting ready for a baby just in case. Every month that a baby doesn\u2019t come along to grow there, the lining that the uterus made to get ready for the baby comes out of the body through the vagina for a few days. It can look a little scary, because it\u2019s blood coming out of your body, and it can be uncomfortable, but it\u2019s perfectly normal and nothing to worry about. It happens to almost everyone with a uterus every month for about 40 years of their life. When the time comes, we have lots of different ways to keep our underwear clean, such as pads that stick to our underwear, and tampons that we insert into the vagina to soak up the blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, ok\u2026 and what\u2019s a comma?\u201d",

He started to ask questions and my cousin shushed him - and the man said that it was ok, at his age, questions were natural and understandable.  (He was missing a leg) \n\nWell - to both their surprise, he wasn't at all curious about the missing leg (because people come in all shapes!) - he was fascinated by his WHEELS.  Kiddo had been bitten by the obsessed by all vehicles bug thanks to grandpa and I think even asked him if it had gears, etc.  When the guy popped a wheelie, my cousin said her kid practically exploded with excitement and she got an immediate request that he wanted a wheelchair too so he could learn to do that.   It tickled the guy thankfully.",

I put my hands on her knees, looked her right in the eyes and said \"What happened to YOU?!\" My mom, of course, was completely mortified that she couldn't stop me in time and started begging for forgiveness lol. But the woman said it was okay and started telling me that she'd had an accident and was really hurt, but that she was getting better. She then told my mom that she had no family or friends and that everyone avoided her for fear of staring. She mentioned that the only times anybody ever talked to her anymore was because they had to, like people at the bank or the doctor's office. She said she was very touched, and she appreciated my frankness and my genuine concern. I don't remember that part of the conversation (I was likely elsewhere or being held in a football carry by my mother), but mom's told me several times over the years because she loved the conversation she had with the woman. I was short enough at the time that I have a memory of standing at her knees and looking up into her face while she was seated in her wheelchair, so I would probably have been about 3 years old.\n\nThe next time I was older, but I still made a friend. A guy in a bookstore had the stump of his leg in an odd carrying pouch? it had clearly been amputated by something and he had it in a sling somehow. It looked really neat and I asked him \"What happened to your leg?\" Mom was across the store from me, heard what I said, dropped everything she was holding and straight up ran across the room to intervene. By the time she arrived he was calmly explaining that he'd been in a war (lived in a military area, not uncommon), that something had exploded near him, and that that's how he lost part of his leg. According to my mom, I simply nodded and said \"Cool.\" I remember chatting with him about the books we each wanted to get and what I liked to read. My mom apologized at some point but he had a similar response that the woman in the wheelchair had to say - that kids are usually scared of him, or point and stare, so it was nice that I just came right out with it and asked and didn't seem afraid.\n\nIt's honestly a miracle I wasn't abducted as a kid. I had ZERO sense of stranger danger. I just wanted to be friends with everybody.",

Taking an interest in other people's lives rather than just pitying them goes a long way I think, just have to identify how to empathize tactfully.",

He loudly said, \u201cI hope I can\u2019t walk one day. I want one of those!\u201d\n\nThe guy in the wheelchair must have heard the whole thing and kept his composure until then and he asked if my son wanted to look at it. My kid thought it was badass and kept asking the guy how fast he could go and if he did tricks on it. \n\nGuy was super cool and the innocence of a kid is under appreciated. \n\nI have a friend that is in a wheelchair from a four wheeling accident when we were in college. My son was 5 when he met him and the guy had him in his lap and was jumping off ledges and doing \u201cwheelies\u201d with him in it. This guy is still a daredevil so he always does wild stuff.\n\nAfter that, my kid asked for a wheelchair for Christmas. \n\nHe got a dirt bike.",

I happily and confidentiality said, in front of my entire family, \"What's up, you old bastard!\" \n\nImmediately realized I had said something wrong and I was so confused when my stepmother (who was an absolute power hungry bitch anyways) began scolding me, \"Where did you learn that word?!? Who did you hear it from?!?\" Honestly didn't know bastard was a bad/derogatory word. And I honestly thought I heard it said by Yosemite Sam from Looney Tunes. At least, that's what I concluded after frantically searching my brain in a panic, while time stood still and everyone's eyes were all on me. \n\nI cried as I apologized to my uncle, embarrassed as shit, even though it really wasn't my fault and I still had no idea what it meant for a long time. Later on I admitted it must've come from my mother's husband, \"Kritter\", technically my \"stepfather\", who was a stupid drunk. Same classy guy who always drove home wasted from the bar. Naive me thought this bi-monthy display of him stumblingly through the door absolutely hammered, often falling asleep with his face in his food a few minutes later, an absolutely hilarious and a highly anticipated event. \n\nOne memory that always stuck with me.. the drunken ritual commensed at it's usually time and place. Kritter picked up a plate off the table that had a piece of my mother's birthday cake and ice cream on it, after stumbling, practically falling through the table, yet regaining his balance by bracing his hand right in the dessert my mom had just prepared for him. Completely unprovoked, unless you count her placing the plate in the wrong place 5 minutes prior, he proceeded to pick up the paper plate, smash and rub it all over the side of her head, saying, \"Here's your fuckin' birthday ice cream, you bitch. I hope you fuckin' choke.\" \n\nSo yeah. Sorry to my uncle and Yosemite Sam. Fuck you, Kritter.",

No idea why, the man didn't even notice my brother til he started crying, and his kid hadn't interacted with him either, other than just looking at him when they first got in like behind us. My mom was MORTIFIED, because on the outside, it looked like my very white brother and very white mom were pointing and being scared of a black man and his family. My mom profusely apologized and tried telling him it's not what he thinks or something. I mean, he'd definitely met black people before lol. Not like we live somewhere exclusively white. He went to daycare with black children in his class. He was just kinda weird sometimes about people looking at him? And I guess that kid looked at him in what his little kid brain perceived as ill intent. That poor man and the cashier are just glaring daggers at my mom. I mean, if he is scared of black people, someone probably taught him to be....we've never hustled out of a Blockbuster that fast before lol. \n\nAnother time, my niece was like 5 at the time while she, myself, and my mom were at a Walgreens waiting on a prescription for my mom. Was gonna take about 20 minutes, so we just hung around and browsed. An employee noticed my niece, and tried to give her some candy they were just gonna throw out anyway for some reason? Well. We had always told her not to accept candy or gifts from strangers. And now here's a stranger, offering her candy. So. She screamed, and ran to my mom. The poor girl was absolutely embarrassed. Lol we explained to the girl why she did that and she understood, and was like yeah my bad, I just didn't really think lol. \n\nLol anyway. My point I guess it's kids are fucking ridiculous and will do the weirdest shit. I'm sorry you have to deal with the shitty parents who don't teach their kid that there are people of all sizes, shapes, colors, etc that exist and it doesn't mean they're any less human or something than you, and to treat everyone the same and with respect.",

People come in lots of colors, but we don't call them that lol",

I have never been shy when my children have asked me questions like \u201cwhy are they in a wheelchair? Why does he talk so different?\u201d Or whatever else it could be; and I have answered honestly every time. I have even, when I assume the situation to have room for it, said to my children that \u201cI don\u2019t know, lets go and ask them.\u201d And then used the oppertunity to teach them how to politely aproach the subject. So far we have only been met with smiles and people willing to educate. (I know where they are coming from, I have one of those invisible illnesses.)\n\nThe other day, we also did something that I should have done much sooner. We were out, eating hamburgers, and these three young adults come in, order and sit at the table next to us. I register that they are there but my children are just staring at them like children tend to do. My daughter says something along the lines of \u201cThey are so cool!\u201d and my son whispers to me \u201cI think she\u2019s beautiful!\u201d \n\n\nI should probably mention that they were dressed in stereotypical goth clothing. This one girl more than the others, pierced all over and sporting a mohawk. \nI could see on their faces what they though. \u201cGreat one of those parents telling their kids not to stare in the hopes that we seize to exist.\u201d\n\nWell, I\u2019m not one of those parents. I looked at my children and said \u201clets go, tell them!\u201d\nSo we walked over to them and told them what we thought of their looks. I\u2019ve never seen a goth glow so much, be it from joy, pride or anything else; it was sincere. We made small talk and the showed my kids some of their clothing accessories. \n\nOn our way home my daughter asked me why we went and talked to them. I asked her if she remembered what I said about when you have nothing nice to say. \u201cThen say nothing!\u201d They both exclaimed. \n\nI acknowledged that and added that it can also work the other way around. If you have something nice to say, say it. \n\nIf you think someone looks good or is doing a good job, tell them. It might just be what they need. \nCompliments can often impact us stronger when they come from complete strangers.",

I swear my blood pressure rose reading that it ticked me off so much. (It came down at your response to someone trying to use you as Santa\u2019s elf though, that reply is absolute gold.)\n\nWanna hear a really stupid story about me as a stupid kid? If not, stop reading now. It\u2019s not a great story but it\u2019s a true one. \n\nYou reminded me of a lady I \u201cknew\u201d as a kid. I put that in quotes because while I knew/know her first name (it was Tanya, although maybe not spelled like that) I only saw her occasionally when shopping. Apparently her grocery shopping schedule and my mom\u2019s overlapped a lot when I was a kid. \n\nShe had dwarfism too and as a small child I was absolutely smitten with her. Mostly it was her hair I think, it was very long and bright red and BEAUTIFUL but the fact she was very obviously a grown woman in grown up lady clothes but only a touch taller than 4-5 year old me was pretty fascinating as well. My mother tried so hard to get me to stop staring and waving at her, to no avail. Because she\u2019d wave right back at me and smile and ask how I was. \n\nShe told me she was an elf (not one of Santa\u2019s elves, somehow I never had that connection in my mind. In my mind she was more like a fairy tale elf, the kind that help out a youngest prince become a hero or something) and after that every time we met in a store she\u2019d tell me some outlandish thing she\u2019d \u201cdone\u201d recently. She really leaned into the storyline and I loved her. \n\nWell, one day she had a man with her and instead of my mom shopping it was my aunt who did not know Tanya. I happily told my aunt \u201clook! It\u2019s Tanya! She\u2019s an elf!\u201d And my aunt started to scold me while the man gave me a really weird look. Tanya burst out laughing and pulled the guy over to our cart to introduce me to him, and told me \u201cThis is Erik, he\u2019s my Prince Charming!\u201d Then told him. \u201cThis is my little friend [my name], I told you about her. Isn\u2019t she just adorable?\u201d\n\nTurns out she was engaged! My aunt was still mad at me though, but she usually was so whatever. \n\nTanya showed me her ring and I was as admiring as any little girl would be over a sparkly piece of jewelry (it really was pretty, it had a blue stone which stuck in my head because every wedding ring I\u2019d seen before had all white) and we parted ways while my aunt fussed at me that I shouldn\u2019t look at \u201cpeople like that\u201d (rude aunt. We\u2019re friends, didn\u2019t you hear her?) \n\nEventually mom and dad moved and I didn\u2019t see her as much. Years later I was a teenager and back in the area when heard someone say my name at a fast food place. I turned around and it was Tanya! I swear she hadn\u2019t aged a day. We caught up a bit and hugged and man it was so cool to see her. I hope she\u2019s still doing well. \n\n/csb",

We walked to the ladies house, my daughter walked up with a small group of other kids and I realized in that painfully long moment that she had never encountered a person with dwarfism before. We'd never talked about it before because it just wasn't part of our lives. She stared and stared. She walks up to the woman who is quite literally 2-3 inches shorter than my daughter because she's in the 99th percentile for height. She got her candy from the lady and walked away BACKWARDS still staring! At this point I was in a panic, I knew she was going to say something. My child talks to strangers, she engages people constantly. \n\nI am actively trying to fade into the shadows. I am likely beet red at this point, terrified of what her little brain is thinking up. She stops in the poor woman's yard and utters the most elegant statement she could muster. \"You're really short.\"\n\nTo the woman's credit she goes, \"Yep. I am.\" \n\nWe had a short and easy conversation about it afterwards because obviously she's seen people in wheelchairs, or really tall people, or people with birth defects, etc. So she was very nonchalant when I was like, yeah she was born that way. But can confirm as a parent I panicked, I saw Jesus and I'm agnostic. \n\nGood on you for being hilarious, I appreciate your wit.",

She got one of the balls out and was bouncing it around when she saw another person in the aisle. She went over to this other child and asked him if he wanted to play ball with her. She told me he turned around to look at her and he had a full on beard and a deep man voice and told her no thank you. Abby had never seen anyone with dwarfism before, and this scared the shit out of her. She immediately dropped the ball and started screaming in terror. The man, in a panic- because this freaking weirdo child just started freaking out out of nowhere- picked the ball up and, thinking that she was screaming because he didn't want to play with her, he threw the ball at her head. The ball bounced off and rolled away and she ran back to her dad crying.",

    "postText": "This happened a couple of years ago. The city was replacing water lines in my neighborhood, basically my street and several surrounding streets. At the time, they were working on my street. The street is narrow with two cars passing at the same time possible but you have to be careful. The guys working had a large trailer that stored their equipment and some tracked equipment.\n\nThe area in front of my house had space to park their equipment. There is a curb and the city owns the property about a foot over the curb towards my house. Then I own 9 feet from the property line to a stone wall. I never really cared about that space. People park there, I sometimes park there... not a big deal. And I didn't care about the workers' trailer and equipment sitting on my property in that area since the street was so narrow.\n\nThis day I went to leave and they had one end of the street blocked off so you had to go out the other end. Not a big deal. But when I went to go out the other end there was a worker cutting the pavement. He saw me and motioned for me to go the other way. I edged up to him and explained it was blocked. \"Not my %$#$% problem\" was his response. I explained it again and he gave me the same response.\n\nI went back to my house and as I did I passed the detail cop so I asked him to follow my back. When I got to my house I asked the cop if he knew who was in charge and he pointed him out. I yelled to the guy and motioned for him to come up to us. He probably saw the cop and thought it was important so he walked up.\n\nWhen he got to us, I looked at the cop and said \"You're my witness. I am trespassing this company from my property. I want this equipment removed.\" The foreman was confused and asked what the issue was and I explained what had happened and told him he had an hour to remove his equipment. He went down to the other worker and I could see his was ripping him a new a-hole. He dragged him up to me and the guy apologized. I told the foreman that I knew there was a lot of work going on and everyone is trying to get through this but if it happens again, I'll just have his gear towed.",

Bring it on.\"\n\nGuys bring it on and start pouring many cubic metres of concrete.\n\nGuys give JP the finger and leave to move down the road further.\n\nJP, big ute and fully laden trailer proceed to drive comfortably through the formwork and concrete.\n\nJP came back a few days later and the work was all finished nicely.\n\nJP was polite and patient.\n\nBe like JP.\n\n![gif](giphy|qujF79swMwIWwppje4|downsized)",

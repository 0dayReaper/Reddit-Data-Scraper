    "postText": "( I posted this on pro-revenge because of the hefty amount but was told to come here)\n\nFirst I wanna say that this is not my story, it's my best friends &amp; she gave me permission to share.\n(She's excited to read the comments lol)\n\n\nSo my friend (I'll call her Melissa, 22f) let an old high school pal (I'll call her Karen, 25f) move into her house about a year back. She brought along with her her big dog and two year old son. Melissa knew this would be a big change but Karen assured her they were both well behaved, and she needed a place to stay to get away from her baby daddy. (Who we later found out was actually a really sweet guy) Problems started almost immediately. The dog ruined Melissas couch &amp; Karen did not respect my friends house. She left trash and food everywhere. Karen constantly invited her baby-dad to stay the night despite Melissa saying he was not allowed in her house. The dog &amp; Karen tormented Melissas 1 year old cat to the point where the poor thing never came out anymore. Then to top it off, when Melissa told Karen she had to leave after about 5-6 months, Karen resorted to verbally abuse Melissa. Spreading horrible lies to people (and it's a small town), making fun of medical conditions Melissa has &amp; saying incredibly inappropriate &amp; insensitive things about her mother who struggles with alcoholism. There's more but let's get to the revenge part. Melissa went no contact after she kicked karen out. Fast forward about a month and she receives a call from Karen while she's at the JFS (Job and family services) office. She was asking if she could use Melissa's address for her insurance to \"save a buck\". My friend said absolutely not and that she doesn't appreciate being asked to commit insurance fraud then hung up. She stewed for a moment then called back. But she didn't call Karen, she called JFS to report her. Karen apparently used her address anyway &amp; was trying to get out of a bunch of medical bills she had stacked up. She was hit with a 28k fine. How did my friend find this out? From Karen's baby daddy....they bonded over this &amp; had started seeing each other. Oops! Anyway, I definitely am glad I'm on Melissas good side! (Jokes)",

Well within a month and a half this dude basically moved his whole family in my home (mom, stepdad, 2 brothers, and his sister) they also brought along their two dogs and a cat..... I tried getting them to move out but they refused so I just said fuck it and moved out with my wife and son.. \n\nMy grandparents made them sign a lease to stay and a few months down the road they hadn't paid any rent so my grandma filed an eviction notice and took them to court after they moved out and ended up getting awarded 50k for breach of contract, and damages.",

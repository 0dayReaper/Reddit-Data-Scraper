    "postText": " I got a sure fire one for you. Go online and find a hunting supply store that sells fox urine (it is used by trappers). THAT SHIT AINT NO JOKE. You can clear out a room simply by removing the cap. Super strong stuff. My brother taught me this one. Anybody wronged him he would dump some down the vents by the windshield wipers on their car, or better yet if the car was open or the window open/cracked, he would pour that shit in. If you can get in the house/apartment just go in and pour some on the carpets. My bro did it to a guy with a trailer and they literally had to move. People who's car he did it to had to get rid of the fuckin car. You CANNOT get that shit out, and the smell is intolerable...gets on you and your clothes. If they call the cops, whats the cop gonna do or say?...nothing because he or she wont even know what the fuck the smell is or what its from. In the case where my bro did it, everybody was trying to guess wtf happened, what the smell could be from, etc. If they are not hunters/trappers, they wont know. Now some tips if you do this...Open the cap VERY CAREFULLY and wear disposable gloves. DO NOT get any on you or your clothes. Once your done make sure the cap is back on TIGHT and get rid of the bottle. Also, if you order it online, do it from a public computer, like at a library. Also, act as confused as everyone else after you do it. DONT brag to anyone about what you did.",

I have heard of it smeared on exhaust manifolds, where it bakes into the metal, and the odor remains for years. \n\nA friend of my Dad's had a VW Beetle with the trunk in the front. He left a jar of this catfish bait in his car, it exploded from the heat of the sun, and even after several cleanings, including steam and other methods, the odor remained. He eventually sold the Beetle to a guy with a poor sense of smell. \n\nI've used this bait for fishing, you dip plastic worms into it. It smells disgusting, and if you get it on your skin, nothing seems to get it off. It has to wear off. Nasty stuff, with lots of uses for revenge.",

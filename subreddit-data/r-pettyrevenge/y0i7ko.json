    "postText": "I recently bought a house and have been having some work done before I move in.  It was empty on the market for about 6 or 8 months before I bought it.\n\nOne morning I got a call from my contractor, asking me about moving the cars in the driveway, and of course I had no idea what he was talking about.   I hadn't moved in yet. \n\nI left my jobsite and drove nearly a half hour to get there.  As soon as I arrived, the people on the east side of me were walking toward the cars. \n\n I asked if they were their cars and they said yes.  They told me that they had been parking there for a few months with permission from the owners.  I informed them that I was the new owner and they can't park there any longer.  We went back and forth, and with the intention of being a good neighbor and trying to show some good will, I agreed to allow them to park there for a few more weeks until I move in; with the agreement that they would move them by 6 am every morning. \n\nThe rest of the week went by without incident.  The contractor called me about scheduling a walk thru on Saturday, and we set a time for early afternoon. \n\nWhen I arrived, there were 4 cars in the driveway, and nowhere to park. (the only on-street parking is 2 blocks away.) I called them and asked them to move their vehicles- reminding them of our agreement.  After 20 minutes, they finally came out and moved them. \n\nSpeaking with them,  they claimed to have misunderstood and thought out agreement only referred to weekdays and not weekends.  I corrected them and moved on.  \n\nSunday morning, I grabbed a trailer and loaded some furniture to take over and store in the garage.  Once again, there were cars in the driveway.  I called them and got VM. I texted and said they had until a tow truck could arrive, to get them moved.  No answer. I called a tow company.  \n\n45 minutes later, 2 tow trucks showed up, backed in and hooked up to the cars.  All of the sudden, the neighbors were home.  They ran out to stop their cars from being towed, and it ended up costing them a little over $300 to get them unhooked.   \n\nI called my contractor and asked if he knew someone who could put in a driveway gate, and he did.  I let the neighbors know that they could no longer use my driveway.  \n\nOn Wednesday, I get a call from the gate installer, telling me that there are cars in the driveway.  I called them and said tow trucks are on the way. They moved.  The gate was installed and I went by to pick up the opener that evening.  The neighbor husband came out to confront me, and I opted to just call the PD, and deal with it legally. \n\nThat Saturday, I went by to accept an outdoor furniture delivery, and check on things when i noticed a towel beside the pool and a small kids flotation device.  My initial thought was that I just hadn't noticed it before, so I wrote it off and threw them both in the trash. \n\nOn Saturday, the movers arrived with everything and we began moving things in.  \n\nAbout 7pm, my daughter and I left to go grab some dinner, arriving back at the house around 930 pm.  \n\nThe neighbors were in my pool.  They were hanging out and using my furniture.  When I opened the door and began raising hell, they told the kids to go to the house and the children ran to a corner of our fence and just walked through.  \n\nThey had cut out the privacy fence so it could be removed and had been using the pool at their leisure for who knows how long. \n\nAgain, I called the police and filed a complaint.  The dad was arrested for trespassing, DPP, and an outstanding warrant, and the oldest boy (20M) for an outstanding warrant. \n\nI replaced the fence with a new one, because they had destroyed the posts, runners and pickets by removing and reinstalling the panel.  Small claims awarded me the total cost of 83' of 8' privacy fence, which came out to $3,800. \n\nThe following Monday morning around 5am, their cars were parked in the street, where there's no street parking, so I made a phone call.  They were gone when I left at 7am.\n\nI haven't been paid yet, but I did notice a For Rent sign in their yard this morning, so that's just as good. \n\nGood riddance.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:  \n\n1.For those of you suggesting a security system:  one was installed that next week, along with 6 cameras around the house, a ring doorbell, and a fence around the pool itself to keep the dogs and my grandson out of it.  I'll be closing and covering the pool in the next few weeks. \n\n2. Met the owner of the house yesterday evening. The house will be empty by the end of the week. They were evicted for non-payment of rent - likely due to tow charges, and the husband not working because he was incarcerated - where he remains.  Warrant was for back child support. Wife apologized and claimed that she was told they had permission to use the pool (they didn't) \n\n3. The material for the fence was purchased through my company account.  I'm a structural engineer and commercial construction manager for a large local GC. \n\nOnly 2 posts had to be replaced and a hand full of runners.  The rest was just 8' 1\"x 6 \" 1/2\" pressure treated pickets, which cost me $2.60 per stick, X 210 pickets purchased. The rest was labor and fasteners.  So, altogether - about $900 for material and stain. $150 for a dumpster, and the rest went toward labor to finish it on a weekend. \n\n Fun fact: I'm also a property investor/flipper.  Been in construction (commercial, civil, industrial and residential) for 35 years. Not my first fence, nor my first asshole neighbor.  \n\nBefore the paint experts jump on board: I know how long I have to wait before pressure washing and staining the fence. \n\n4. The petty was only my twisting the knife by having their cars towed from the street, when they weren't affecting me at all. \n\nTLDR: Neighbors at new house used my driveway, and destroyed my backyard fence to use the pool.  Sued them and won. Had their cars towed, and now their being evicted for non payment of rent.",

(unfortunately hard to find concrete information, as there's a lot of 'top 10 absurd lawsuit' type things.)\n\nWe'll put aside the school vs private residence- but the key issue was that the skylight had been *painted over*. So it becomes an issue that even though the kid was not supposed to be there, the school had deliberately created an unsafe condition- which could have affected someone who actually was authorized to be there.\n\nI kind of think of their reasoning like 'two wrongs don't make a right'. The kid wasn't supposed to trespass, but the 'correct' punishment is not lifelong severe disability. The school's negligence is not really related to or mitigated by the kid's crime, so they're on the hook for the uh, 'excess' punishment, we'll say.\n\nHowever from my understanding this is far from universal, and in fact it's a pretty rare law. Most states/countries/areas don't put a burden of care for trespassers.",

A kid recovering his misthrown baseball from an unfenced yard doesn't deserve to have his leg caught in a bear trap. Obviously most examples aren't so extreme, but property owners have a general obligation to not create (or negligently allow to exist) safety hazards where an unsuspecting person might stumble into them. Trespassing is a fairly minor crime that is easy to commit accidentally or with good intentions; trespassing shouldn't mean you lose all your rights to safety.",

I asked them several times not to park there anymore because we bought the property, but they didn't care. So the Owner (my boss) told me to advertise them as used cars, but for the half price. I took out an ad for each one and put it on them windscreens. When the owners came back owners, they asked me what that should be? I told them if they parked there again we would sell their car.

She had been calm and well trained around my great-uncle, but there was no knowing if she would even listen to me at all, and then if that training would allow my parents to handle her without me there. And this was while also dealing with her grief and being forced into a new place with new people. My whole family loves animals, and we would have made it work, but it definitely wasn\u2019t something we wanted to do.\n\nThankfully one of my great-uncle\u2019s friends (whom I refer to as my great-aunt even tho they never were romantically involved) was able to take in the parrot, and since the parrot knew her, things went over a lot better than they would have if I\u2019d had the parrot forced on me. I assume the reason she wasn\u2019t on the list to take the parrot to begin with, was because she and my great-uncle weren\u2019t legally bound to one another in any way. She ended up taking in most of his animals, including two very old and big tortoises as well.",

He already had one, so when a family I was babysitting for was unwittingly abusing a conure, Elvis came home with me. After that it was an African Grey who was so neglected it had developed feather pulling. Took 3 years for SO and I to get it to be somewhat OK. The fact that we found these birds \ndespite living 200 miles from a city, made me realize just how many unhappy birds are out there. SO, and I remained best friends, but still coparented for years, in that he traveled a lot and of course didn't trust anyone to take proper care. He wouldn't have traveled so much without me. His future wife and I became besties. She is fabulous and got used to the very loud macaw, and all of the fresh food responsibilities etc. I would never ever buy a parrot. I don't want to support an industry that very well knows the frequency of pet parrots being mistreated. It's very very common. Heartbreakingly common.  \n\nIt is my opinion that it is rarely a good situation for a single bird to be kept as a pet. Parrots are for the most part monogamous, and being very social, live in flocks. People who leave their birds alone while they go to work all day, do not have a bird living it's best life. It's stoked to see you because it's lonely, and you are it's family, or mate. Most people who want parrots have zero clue about the lifelong commitment and dedication required for a bird to be happy. I would have loved to have kept Elvis, but it was not in his best interest for me to be selfish and force him to be a single bird while I worked and lived a normal life out of the home during the day. Yes, some birds can be ok, even happy, but most parrots in captivity are not.",

The only reason I got birds is because I work from home and can give them attention all day. As I write this in holding my little Dumpling will my best friend is cuddling with my other birb. They have a healthy diet, lots of attention and space, and they also have each other as we got two birbs who luckily bonded somewhat. Birds bonding doesn't always happen so we got really lucky.",

It\u2019s always good to hear a crappy situation be resolved without a bunch of damage being inflicted upon the reporting party\u2019s property/possessions. \n\nI moved my family to a different state in 2020 and we were fortunate enough to find a home in an older non-hoa development. The neighbors are in their 50\u2019s and up, and they\u2019ve all lived here since the homes were built. There are few homes with families that have younger kids who are really respectful. \n\nMy neighbors even enjoy when I play my drums. I\u2019ve given them all my business cards with my number and email on it. I told them that until I have my studio sound proofed, I won\u2019t play past 6 pm, but if at anytime during the day I get too loud, just text or call me and I;ll either stop or play softer. So far not one neighbor has said anything. \n\nOne older gentleman did ask to see my kits. He said when he was young his family lived in Mexico. His dad bought him a drum set, but his sister got sick so the family had to sell a bunch of stuff to help pay for treatments. She unfortunately passed away, and when his dad tried to buy him another kit, he no longer wanted to play because his sister was no longer with them. \n\nIt took a bit of convincing, but I finally got him to sit behind my 70\u2019s Ludwig Vistalite. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling as he messed around on it. His wife told me a few days later that was the happiest she\u2019s seen him in years.",

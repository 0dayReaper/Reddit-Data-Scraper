    "postText": "Years ago, I was sitting on a bus. We picked up a bunch of passengers, one of which sat next to me on my right. I am a man also but always careful to keep my legs within my own space. This young man sits down and immediately spreads right into my space pressing his calf right against mine. I'm a stubborn pick with absolutely no problem letting things get awkward and uncomfortable. We sat with out calves pressed against each other for about 30 minutes before he gave up and moved is leg into his own space. Without even a second of hesitation I moved my calf right back up against his and left it there until he moved again.",

I looked at my 6\u20192\u201d 245 lb husband with wtf eyes, and he just smiled at me and put his big meaty hand right over the guys, my hubs even tried to interlock fingers. Pure joy, it was the absolute best way to handle things, the guy instantly retracted said hand and I didn\u2019t see it again for the whole flight.",

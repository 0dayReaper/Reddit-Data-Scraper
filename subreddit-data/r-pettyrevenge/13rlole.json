    "postText": "This was a couple months ago. I was waiting at the station, when the train pulled up. Not a busy platform and not a busy train, but the woman behind me aggressively pushed past me to get on first (even ahead of people getting off the train) and almost knocked me over. Fine whatever, you want a seat. And she did get a seat, to then pull out a book where she was visibly only a few chapters in. Coincidence is that I finished that exact same book a few weeks before, and there's a massive, massive twist 3/4 into the book. Just as I get off train, I walk past her and say \"the wife is faking it the entire time\" and walk off. Felt pretty good",

Lady was acting out bc the bookstore had no more copies the day it came out - only ones left were for the people who paid to reserve one.  Someone in the store witnessed her bitch fit, walked up to her and just told her simply: \"I'll save you some time - Prim dies.\"  I wish I could have seen it with my own eyes.  Epic.",

As a joke, I read the last line of the book they were reading out loud thinking that out of context it probably wouldn't make sense or at least wouldn't ruin the story completely.  The last line was a dollar amount.  Apparently whatever it referred to was the main point of the story.  Sorry, Gary.",

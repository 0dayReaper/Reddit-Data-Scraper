    "postText": "I found out my fiance was cheating on me when I was 8 months pregnant. A bit of a hard blow. Now for context this guy was a wealthy guy and he liked nice things. He had a lot of expensive high end clothing. Now I am not a revenge type person and I am don't like conflict (or repercussions) and I was in a pretty vulnerable position. So after I asked him to leave I went and got all of his suit trousers and carefully loosened/I picked the stitches around the crotch/seat area. This was not really noticeable. However any bending or crouching they would have split wide open.\nI never got to see or even hear about this but I know it must have happened. It was a slight source of comfort.",

    "postText": "I (f23) had 3 other female roomates last year. All females. I deep cleaned the whole house- NO HELP. Living room and kitchen. The ONLY thing i asked was someone take out the trash. Texted them- left me on read. When i came in the house- they ran to their rooms. When i ran into them outside in the parking lot- they made excuses to get on the phone or act like they didn\u2019t see me. I finally asked one roommates in specific \u201cplease take out the trash\u201d via text. She responded \u201cThats not my responsibility, get one of the other girls to do it.\u201d I was FED UP! \n\nSo i did it. I took the garbage out to the dumpster\u2026\n\nAnd the garbage can went with it\u2026\n\n* 4 days later *\n\nRoommate 1: Wheres the garbage can?\nMe: *leaves on read, while keeping a brand new, personal garbage can in my room.*\n\nRoommate 2: \u201cHey can someone put the garbage can back out?\u201d\nMe: *ignores*\n\nIf i cant have a garbage can - NO ONE CAN! Pun intended.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFirst off, wow! I dont think I\u2019ve ever got this much engagement on a reddit post! So thank you to everyone who commented or said something.\n\nSecond, for those who said I should\u2019ve dumped the trash on their bed, honestly i should have haha! But i dont think i reached that level of pettiness. But they definitely needed to take responsibility \n\nLastly, what happened after in detail. A small detail i should have mentioned prior too, is that this is a student living apartment complex. So they\u2019re college students. I\u2019m an out of state resident. And just to give you a time frame i cleaned the entire house 2 weeks prior to them taking the trash out. I cant cook in a dirty kitchen. So i had to clean the kitchen but as far as further then that, i stayed mostly in my room. So i didn\u2019t care about the living area. So yes\u2026 they let the garbage sit for 2 weeks. It was disgusting and leaking snd i tried to hold out, but with the smell i couldn\u2019t take it. After that, they definitely tried to find out what happened to the trash can but i was over it. One even tried to set up a chore chart (something i tried to set up months prior too). Its just ridiculous to see how dirty a house full of females can be. But i made my point and i proved it.\n\nI\u2019ve been at this apartment for almost 2.5 years now. Fingers crossed, this is my last year and I\u2019ll have my own house this time next year! So yayyy to no more roomies haha!",

Instead it was just buying and hiding my own toilet paper, taking a singular roll in and out of the bathroom with me when I had to use it. They all conveniently \u201cforgot\u201d when it was their turn to buy more, and then had the audacity to use 2 rolls a day. Nope, not playing that game.",

Considering someone abusive for suggesting that they are using too much tp? \n\nI\u2019m glad you enjoyed your giggle lol, I feel no shame stealing toilet paper from work considering everything I do for the place from my own pocket since they don\u2019t refund expenses, oh and the countless hours of unpaid overtime (I do love my job though). The toilet paper amounts to like, 0.05% of what they would actually owe me from the start of this year?\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not about the money for me when it comes to waste. Waste money how you like. But toilet paper is bulky, it takes big lorries travelling all over the country to transport the stuff, and people getting through a roll every day or two versus every three weeks means that it\u2019s causing environmental harm by literally 10x more than it needs to be.\n\nNot to mention the environmental harm of growing and chopping down trees (or if using recycled then taking up a recycled resource that could be used in another area), adding various chemicals which become waste afterwards and are difficult/impossible to dispose of without some kind of environmental impact, the plastic wrapping, the factories etc\u2026 oh and then of course all the used tp has to be processed and removed\n\nReally please understand my issue with people wasting toilet paper is not about the money lol, it\u2019s just such a stupid thing to be wasteful with. If you\u2019re going to be wasteful with a resource, at least let it be enjoyable. I certainly don\u2019t get more pleasure from wiping my ass with a massive wad of paper versus an appropriately sized wad.",

She was in college \"for fun\" and only even lived in the dorms bc the college forced you to do at least 1 year. Daddy bought her a condo to live in after.\n\nWhen it came time for move out time, she was like \"oh, I don't feel like hauling my stuff away. You can have it :)\" and my sister and her other roommates were like \"no, we don't wanna go through all your stuff and toss it either.\"\n\n So she says \"hmm oh well, the fine for leaving things behind is only like, what? 200 dollars? I'll just pay that!\"\n\n Except the fine wasn't 200 dollars. It was 800 dollars split between all tenants. It was a part of the room and board agreement, if even one of them left shit behind they'd all get charged. So the 3 of them ended up having to clean out her shit anyway, bc they knew full well it'd be easier than trying to argue with the school about her or take her to court for petty damages.\n\nOnly good thing about that girl was my sister got a lot of free designer clothes and shoes out of her lol. She didn't know how to do laundry so she literally just wore her clothes a few times and then bought more.",

They got together in college and moved off together for the first time in a new state for my dad to go to law school after he finished his bachelors. \n\nWhen they planned to go back to their home state to visit family, my mom was like \"why are you packing dirty laundry?\"\n\n Dad: \"oh if we take it home to my mom she'll do it\"\n\n Mom: \"we are absolutely not doing that, what the hell?\"\n\n Dad: \"why not? She doesn't mind, she always did this for me when I came home to visit in college\"\n\n Mom, contemplating her relationship for a moment: \"no. We're not doing that. Or at least, you're gonna take out all of my stuff bc frankly thats kind of embarrassing. I'm an adult and I don't need my future mother in law doing my laundry while we're guests in her home\"\n\n\n To my dad's credit, he did do his fair share of housework otherwise lol, not one of those \"replace my mother with my girlfriend\" kinda men. But my mom was just like ... you didn't do your own laundry in college what the hell? \n\nDad wasn't a single child, but grandma had him very late in life, 16 year age gap from his closest sibling, so he was kinda treated like one. Do think my grandma spoiled him in some ways lol. Though my dad himself isn't like that, I do also get the impression my grandparents were very old fashioned in their own beliefs about \"men and women's roles\" so it makes sense that my grandma would do that for him without thought lol.",

She would run out of clean clothes and have no cash left to use the coin operated machines in her apartment building. So she would find a credit card that wasn\u2019t maxed out and just buy more clothes. She had some really nice clothes too and they would be piled up all over the floor with her dog walking around on them. That obviously caught up with her eventually and her phone would just buzz nonstop from debt collectors calling her. It gave me so much second hand anxiety to watch. She made a decent living too but she would blow $300 at Sephora as soon as she got paid again and then be unable to pay her bills. I was living on a preschool teacher salary at the time and I would literally have to budget $10 in quarters from each paycheck to do laundry. I tried to tell her to pay her bills first and then figure out how much she could spend on luxuries. She said I was being judgmental so I dropped it and stopped engaging when she talked about money problems. I would just go hmmm and change the subject.",

I got fed up touching other people's blood and stopped taking it out. The smell was unbearable so I just stopped using our bathroom and used the public one in the lobby.

She told me I had a week to find a new place.\n\nFine! I had secretly been looking for a new place and already had one. I had some friends come get my minimal furniture that night and moved out. Rent was due the next week. Guess who had to pay the whole rent by herself? Her boyfriend was BEGGING me to come back because he was unemployed and they didn't know how they would pay the rent. I laughed and laughed at the texts and smoked a joint in my clean house with just me and my cat.\n\nI vowed never to have a roommate again unless I was married to them.",

            "comment": "Once upon a time I worked in a place that had two types of people. Those who did mostly outside or mostly inside work. I was one of those who did the inside work. \n\nAll of these guys were coffee drinkers, except me.  At first they were mad because the inside guys unofficial job was to keep a fresh pot of coffee going since he was inside as a \u2018courtesy\u2019 to the others.  I explained I didn\u2019t drink coffee and that I would not make fresh coffee every few hours just to be nice.  They grumbled but took the message.\n\nThere was only one trash can next to the coffee and it always got full.  Cups, coffee filters, you name it.  Not being a total dick I would empty this trash can 2-3 times a day because I hated to have it overflowing while working nearby. I was not pleased the coffee drinkers would not empty their own damn trash but they did not seem to care, perfectly happy to await the once daily cleaning from the janitors.\n\nOne day the trash was full, again.  So pulled the bag out and went for a short walk to the dumpster.  Didn\u2019t bother to put a new bag in immediately since I would do it once I came back. The bag was full and likely would leak so I didn\u2019t want to delay.\n\nDuring this time I stopped to chat with a coworker for maybe 3 min just outside the door.  When I came back someone had emptied the coffee grind/filters into the empty trash can without putting a bag in. \n\nI lost it. I picked the trash can up and threw it away. I was done emptying this garbage. The bags were in the trash can and just needed a new one torn off and opened. But the coffee drinkers had decided that was not their job and just dumped coffee grinds right on top of a roll of trash bags.\n\nCoworker(s) demanded I put it back over the course of the next few days, suddenly coffee production ground to halt.  There was nowhere to put empty cups or grounds and the different shifts were about to go at it for the \u2018mess\u2019 the others were leaving behind. I was adamant that since they couldn\u2019t keep the place clean that I was done and would not be cleaning up after them anymore.  Fuck that trash can, I didn\u2019t need it, it was only there for the coffee machine.\n\nIt took two weeks to get a new trash can. During that time the area with the coffee machine went through a few different stages.  Suddenly having to take their trash   about 30 feet down the hall proved too much.  The room became trashed.  People started to complain about their own mess.  Got mad at me, to which I could only point non of them bothered to take out the overflowing trash the weeks prior and that even when I did they would just dump stuff in the empty trash can anyway.  I told them the new trash can got full I would just throw those away as well.\n\nWas it drama I could have avoided? Sure.  But once we got a new trash can back you can be sure that some others stepped up to the plate to keep the area clean.  I got comments about it for years, but you know what happened? They emptied the fucking trash.",

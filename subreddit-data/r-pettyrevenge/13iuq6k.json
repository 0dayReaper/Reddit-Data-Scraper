    "postText": "I moved in to my new house a few years ago.\n\nThe people living right beside my house are a bunch of two faced, envious cowards.\n\nEverything I added to my house that they saw, they would try to one up. \n\nGarden, lighting, gazebo, even my washer and dryer. Every time I get something new, they\u2019d get something similar the very next week.\n\nWell, I got a bit of extra income last year and bought myself my dream car.\n\nIt was expensive but, worth it.\nThe neighbors couldn\u2019t match it. Instead, they punctured one of its tyres?\n\nHow do I know? I overheard them talking about it so I check my CCTV footage. One of them crawled under the gate of my property, and nail gunned one of my car\u2019s tires.\n\nI saved the footage but blood went to my head, I decided to get back at them.\n\nThey have a dirt road for a driveway and they own a food catering business. I soaked a bunch of nails in coca cola then brake fluid to make them rust in a short time. \n\nScattered them all over their driveway and watched as their delivery vehicles go up and down the road. \n\nAll their vehicles\u2019 tires were punctured by multiple nails per tire and their business was interrupted.\n\nAt the same time, I reported them to the cops with the footage I saved. They were charged with malicious destruction of property.",

Some sort of automatic transfer system, where you load the washer, the machine does the washing, shifts the laundry into the dryer for you, the dryer gets started automatically. So you only load and unload once.\n\n2. A bit farther off (and much more expensive, but much more desirable): a third appliance to add to the washer and the dryer...the fucking *folder.* I would pay an embarrassing amount of money for a machine that would do the folding for me.",

    "postText": "Obligatory \u201cI\u2019m on mobile sorry for the formatting.\u201d\n\nI am a light skinned Latina American and I lived in Korea for a couple of years during university and grad school, as my major was Korean Interpretation and Translation. During my time in Korea I was lucky enough to attend music shows from time to time. For the kpop uninitiated, music shows are free to enter, provided you have at least 1 of 3 items: a) a copy of the album of the group you\u2019re coming to see, b) proof of purchase of the album digitally on one of the approved music vendors in Korea, or c) the official lightstick from the most recent concert. \n\nPriority entry was always given to official fan club members who had all 3, then fan club members who had 2 of the 3, and then fan club members who had one. After that came non-members in the same priority tier. \n\nThe group I had come to see hadn\u2019t opened official fan club registration in almost a decade, so the group\u2019s management decided to do away with the fan club priority and did it on a first come, first serve basis, but kept the whole 3 items go first, then 2 then 1 thing. I had all three and I got there early, so I got a good spot in line. These queues often had us waiting outside for hours while the previous round of filming finished up. \n\nThe thing about these music show venues is, they\u2019re very small. They have limited capacity and allow 2-3 groups\u2019 fans in to watch them film at a time, so not all people who queue for a group get in. In this particular instance, there was trouble with foreign fans causing trouble by taking pictures, not listening to instructions, so venue staff literally went through and QUIZZED each foreigner in line on their korean. If you couldn\u2019t understand, you were booted. I passed with flying colors and kept my spot in line. \n\nHERE\u2019S WHERE THE REVENGE STARTS. \n\nBecause of the aforementioned issues, a lot of Korean fans HATED international fans with a passion. For this group in particular so many people were PISSED that they had to wait in line behind foreigners because they\u2019d done away with the official fan club priority. Now here\u2019s me, sitting alone in a queue outside on a hot summer day. A group of Korean girls sat in front of me, and a lone Korean girl talking on her phone sat behind me. \n\nI was minding my own business playing games on my phone after passing my Korean quiz with the staff, when I heard the girl behind me talking shit. She was chatting with a friend I suspect because she was dropping a lot of curse words, and specifically mentioned \u201cthese foreign roaches ruining things for us. I want to kill them.\u201d She mentioned me in particular and said that she bet I\u2019d bribed the staff to keep my spot in line even though I couldn\u2019t understand Korean. \n\nOkay so. It\u2019s harmless shit talk, I don\u2019t know this girl and I don\u2019t know her friend. In the long run, it doesn\u2019t affect me, right? But it really rubbed me the wrong way, especially because she was talking quite loudly. So I grabbed my wallet, politely and quietly asked the Korean girls in front of me to watch my bag and hold my place in line, and went to the convenience store. I bought a round of water for everyone. It was heavy. I had about a dozen bottles of water. \n\nI get back to my spot in line, thank the girls in front of me for holding my spot, then gave them each a water. I gave a water to the group in front of them, too. Then I kept one for myself and turned around and handed one to the girl on the phone with a smile. \n\nImmediately she lit up and thanked me in English, smiling bright and taking her phone away from her ear. As I hand her her water, I say in perfect Korean and still smiling, \u201cThe next time you loudly shit talk the foreigners, make sure they can\u2019t actually understand you.\u201d\n\nWhen I tell you it went silent in the immediate area, you could hear a pin drop. Her smile melted off her face faster than an ice cream cone on Florida pavement. She turned beet red and muttered to her friend on the phone that she had to go and sheepishly apologized. I accepted, she had water, and I felt better about myself. \n\nBonus: the girls in front of me heard the whole thing and adopted me into their group for the day. Fun was had all around.\n\nEDIT: typos and formatting\n\nEDIT 2: WOW this blew up, thank you all for the awards! Kill \u2018em with kindness every day, y\u2019all.",

The difference between \uc5b4 and \uc624, for example, as well as \uc73c and \uc758 and such. On top of that there's a weird trend of switching between k and g for \u3131  sounds at random makes it really unreliable (like how \uae40\ubc25 is spelled as both kimbap and gimbap, when it is closer to gimbap since kimbap would be spelled \ud0b4\ubc25). I personally hate the system of romanization for Korean, I wish it was revamped.",

It's categorised alongside Arabic and Mandarin as requiring the most work for English speakers to learn it to a proficient level. I would certainly agree that it is easier than those, mostly because being able to quickly pick up reading opens your study up so much, but it's still difficult. I do hear a lot of Korean learners talk about how easy it is, but most of the time their Korean is for shit, so...",

No offense to foreigners, it's amazing that they're learning a new language and culture, but imo pronunciation for foreigners is one of the hardest things to get correct. Even the grammar gets really crazy sometimes, especially for people who speak English as their first language, because the sentence structure is completely flipped. Gets pretty weird in complicated sentences. So yeah, definitely not the easiest Asian language.",

A huge percentage of marriages in Korea are inter-cultural, in particular because men in the countryside marry women from SE Asia and China who have little opportunity in their country. The thing is, it's all hidden. The women adopt Korean culture and language and their children grow up never knowing their mother's cultural background. That's happening now, but it's also been happening for a very long time. I mean, they were occupied by Japan for 35 years... They didn't retain 'blood purity'. There's all sorts of reasons why the percentage of Koreans who have mixed ethnic backgrounds is actually enormous, but Korea continues to cling to a brand of ethnic nationalism that prefers to erase those identities.",

Really Koreans are a mixture of Chinese, Japanese and Korean when you think about it. I\u2019m half Korean, and half White, my Dad was sent to Korea by the Peace Corps. Why Korea for a white boy from Southern California? Turns out if you play an instrument it\u2019s easier to learn Korean, my dad played trumpet. Something about knowing how to play music made it easier for your brain to learn how to speak and read and write the language. I\u2019ve lost almost all of the language, I\u2019m sure if I was immersed for a while it would come back. It\u2019s still in my brain it\u2019s just lost.",

Sure, many people know English to some level, however, for example Koreans living in Korea will understand Korean to a much greater level than they understand English and if a foreigner to that country is going to live there then they are doing a big disservice to the local people by not learning the language thus ensuring that most interactions that they have are more difficult than needed.",

My friend didn't. I told him he could try for Rocket Punch and he said he would try that as he was interested in the group. He got in.\n\nOn the day (well, night before) we head over to Incheon, chill at a PC bang and then get there at 5am for check-in. My friend doesn't get in. Why?\n\nThe manager questioned every person in line to see if they were a fan. The question was essentially their favourite b-side + age order from youngest to oldest. My friend doesn't know Korean, but he knew the answer. Regardless he got cut.\n\nI did warn him that he might be questioned, as it is common for smaller groups to do so as some fans of other groups may join less popular groups to get in easily. That wasn't the issue. He was aware of it. \n\nThe issue was when I went to their line and I inquired about why my friend left his spot and the manager basically (rudely) went off and said, \"If he came to Korea and wanted to watch Korean shit he should have learnt enough Korean.\"\n\nSo he went back to Seoul, one hour away in cold af weather without any sleep.",

I\u2019d probably have barged in long before even thinking of buying them anything.\n\nAs a South Korean, I sometimes worry that our language is becoming, well, too rough. I lived for a few years in the US and another few more in Japan, and whenever I see young Korean tourists, their rough language sorta startles me. Once in Kyoto, I was taking pictures of the outside scenery from a bus, and I heard some Korean youths say: \u2018WTF is this dude doing taking pictures on a BUS?\u2019 \nI looked back to let them know that I understood them, and they got off at the next stop.",

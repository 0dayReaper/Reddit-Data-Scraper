    "postText": "I used to work for a sandwich shop. All the other employees there were Indian women with very long black hair. Mine was sort of similar I suppose? Medium length and brown. But every time a customer would complain about a long black hair in the food, my boss would immediately blame me without any hesitation or investigation, despite the fact that I was the only person who wore my hair up and netted. So one day I dyed my hair blue with the sole purpose of not being blamed for black hair being in the food. You guessed it, it happened. And how huffy and annoyed my boss got when I said it couldn't be my hair because mine is blue, was beyond amusing",

In those couple of months it's gotten to the point where she's getting more hours than the rest of us and acts like she's a manager. I'm also absolutely certain she's the reason I got I trouble for taking a 12 minute break instead of 10 minutes\n\nFor better or worse I think the teenage girls who work with me are too manipulative to actually get with him. They'll just use him to advance their own agenda",

The people who have those jobs have them because they made poor choices and then made the best of what they got. Some are good people and some are horrible people, but they're almost all bitter and miserable.\n\nBut the worker bees, the servers and fry cooks and tellers and dishwashers and stockers and cashiers, they're usually people who want a simple job that ends when it ends, part time and not too stressful so they can go to school or pass time in retirement or just make some money over the summer or whatever.\n\nWe're automating the wrong jobs. We should be replacing the managers with robots, not the cashiers!",

The other guy just froze up and didn't do anything but walk out after her, and the laughing guy paid the bill, tipped me ten bucks and handed Richard a twenty for making the whole thing ten times more hilarious.

One day there was a hair. No big deal. It was great for awhile longer. Then another hair. Then again. And again. And again. 4 visits in a row. I quit going there. a year later I decided to give them a try again. What do you know another hair. I gave up on them and have not touched the place in more than 3 years.",

The place ended up shutting down because he was assaulting the floor staff and one of them took him to court.\n\nEdit to add:\nIt was a table of 6. Their food bill alone was $240 ish, and they\u2019d been ordering cocktails all night. If I had to pay their full bill it would\u2019ve been more than a week\u2019s wages.",

            "comment": "I used to work at an amusement park selling funnel cakes. It\u2019s not Epcot, but there were \u201clands\u201d in the park. I was working in Germany. So my uniform was a dirndl dress and a mop hat. On this particular day, I was at the cash register at the far end of the counter no where near the fryer. After a big rush, a man comes storming back, heads straight my way, shoves his plate near my face and screams that there\u2019s a hair in funnel cake.\n\nThe hair in question was brown, long and curly. There was me and one other girl who working that day. She was a blonde. Her hair was tied in a ponytail, also under a mop hat. The other 2 workers were boys. So \u201cobviously\u201d it had to be *mine*. And while I also had long hair, it was black, pin straight and the time was in a French braid and pinned into a bun *under* the mop hat. \n\nThe guy got even more mad when my manager pointed out that it couldn\u2019t have been anyone behind the counter. His wife then came inside to see what was taking him so long\u2026 can you guess what type hair *she* had?",

    "postText": "**Setup:**  \n  I (37 M) and my husband (30 M) relocated to upstate New York for his military assignment 2 years ago. At the time he was an Army E4 Specialist, over the course of the next few months we got settled in, but I hadn\u2019t made any meaningful personal connections in the area. Army wives are very cliquey and in rural NY the locals are not very accepting of two queer POC men, like my husband and I. In late November that year, a new E5 Sergeant transferred into my husband\u2019s unit, and they hit it off as buds. She invited us over to her place to hang out with her and her wife. Let\u2019s call her Sergeant Wambach (34 F) and her wife Glennon (29 F). Wambach does have a small child with an ex, who she does not see, due to the separation and custody agreement. From what she told us, she does pay child support and video call occasionally. That bit of info will come into play much later in the story. An additional two side notes for civilian readers: First, there are 2 ranks at the E4 level, specialist, and corporal. Corporal is a lateral promotion from specialist.  Second, soldiers who are E4 Corporals or above are Non-commissioned Officers. Non-commissioned Officers have strict codes of conduct they must follow. That code covers things like acceptable behavior between higher and lower ranks, general acceptable behavior, and prescribed punishments if the code is broken. Non-commissioned Officers also have lower enlisted soldiers whom they must supervise and generally keep out of trouble. Like a mentor role. Please keep that in mind for the rest of the read. \n\nMy husband is eager for us to hit it off with Wambach and Glennon, as having queer friends to socialize with will allow us to be openly ourselves around them and expand my social circle at the same time.  The weekend comes and we are having a wonderful time. My husband sees this and pushes us to be regular friends, Wambach and Glennon are lovely at this time, so my hubby and I begin to spend a lot of time together with them from then on. \n\n**The Issue:** \n\nFlash forward 6 weeks to January and Wambach texts my husband and confides in him that the Army has royally screwed her pay up. She hasn\u2019t been paid since arriving in NY because of clerical errors. The base she left didn\u2019t file her transfer properly so the new base can\u2019t pay her until the matter is cleared up, and the old unit\u2019s leadership is poking their ass and not helping her resolve the matter. And she\u2019s hurting for money, badly. She is behind on rent, car and insurance payments and using what little her and Glennon had saved to pay for essentials like food, hygiene products, and gas.  Wambach shows my husband screenshots of emails between her and the leasing office of her off base housing that are demanding immediate payment or she will face eviction. Wambach asks my husband for financial help; my husband asks me for my input as we do tend to follow the 2 yes 1 no rule for most of our major decisions together. We talked it over and decided to offer her a one-time loan of $500 USD which we paid through Cash App on the condition that she repay us when the clerical issue has been resolved. She gladly accepted the terms of our deal and our money. My husband and I both had a soft spot for Wambach and Glennon at the time because of the friendship we had begun to forge with them, and we also had been in the same situation before with the army while stationed in S. Korea. But we live frugally and put most of our money into savings, so we made it out of that situation quickly and with most of our savings intact. My husband also has a very generous and giving nature, I use to as well, but I\u2019ve been burned in the past by \u201cfriends\u201d and family, so I\u2019ve cut way back on how much I help people anymore. \n\nThree days later, Wambach again asked my husband for another loan, this time in person, for another $500 USD. She makes the same promises of repaying us when her pay issues are resolved. My husband wants to continue helping her but tells her that he\u2019ll talk it over with me, before releasing the money to her. I asked him to wait till he gets home from duty. Once home I ask him to confirm through text messages that she intends to repay us this second loan before we agree to give her any more money. Like I mentioned, I\u2019ve been burned before, so I\u2019ve developed a system to cover our behinds, just in case. She agrees to repay us, so we send her the additional $500 USD and then I ask my hubby to screenshot the portions of their text conversation that pertain to the loans and the Cash App transaction receipts and to email them to me. I know that sometimes a situation gets worse before it gets better so I don\u2019t think too much of her asking for additional help but I\u2019m going to take precautions either way. \n\nWe continued to spend time with Wambach and Glennon over the next few weeks. By mid-February, Wambach lets us know via text, that the pay error has been resolved but asks for us to be patient a little longer, so that she and Glennon can dig themselves out of the financial hole they were in. My husband and I aren\u2019t monsters so we tell them to pay us when they have their heads above water, and I ask my husband to screenshot and send me that text exchange for what will eventually turn into my revenge dossier on Wambach. Over the course of several months, Wambach or Glennon asks either my husband or myself to provide them with smaller loans for things like gas or supply them with their favorite beers/hard seltzers for cook outs at their place, even though we were already bringing our fair share of main courses or side dishes to share. When we first started helping Wambach and Glennon, we assumed their financial situation was all out of their control, a result of the clerical error made by the Army. But as we spent more time with them, we learned that wasn\u2019t entirely true. They were both terrible at managing their own money and were depending on our continued help to subsidize their lifestyle, the army\u2019s error only exacerbated the matter. Simply put, they were living far beyond their means. Everyone should be able to treat themselves to the occasional nice meal or new clothing item, videogame or whatever they enjoy but when you are borrowing the sums of money, they asked of us, you better realize you have got to cut the fat and you start with your luxuries and make do with just the necessities.\n\nDuring this time, they also made several excuses as to why they couldn\u2019t repay us in part or in full, excuses like \u201cour many pets have flees and need treatment\u201d, \u201cwe\u2019re saving up for a trip\u201d, \u201cwe budget $80 a month each to play Pok\u00e9mon Go\u201d. The latter two I found personally very insulting, because if I was in the same boat as them, I wouldn\u2019t be allocating money for luxury expenses. Because in my mind, if I have \u201ctaking a vacation\u201d money, in actuality I have \u201cpaying you back\u201d money. \n\nEither way, with each transaction, and request we screenshot and save the evidence. When their debt to us grew to about $1,500 USD, I decided to have a frank discussion with my husband and let him know that I will not support the decision to financially help Wambach or Glennon any longer from our joint account, and upon their return from their trip to see family, we will be confronting them, and demanding they repay us in full, or at least create a repayment plan with installments. I admit, I am the one who put my foot down on the matter first, but to my surprise, hubby was on board and feeling the same way, he did have some reservations about how to go about the matter because Wambach is now at this point my husband\u2019s immediate NCO which further compounds the issue for us, and the future consequences for her. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. So, to avoid any potential retaliation on her part, my husband and I decided that I would be the one to confront them in our group chat.\n\nAbout a week after they returned from their trip, which was in mid-September, I message them in our group chat which consisted of just the 4 of us, I sent the following message: \u201cNow that you\u2019re back from the trip to see Wambach\u2019s family, we wanted to talk to you both about repaying the various loans we\u2019ve given you. They total about $1,500 according to our Cash App receipts. We wanted to wait until you returned from the trip because we knew how important seeing Wambach\u2019s family was to the both of you. We PCS (Permanent Change of Station, relocating for a new assignment) in a little over 6 months from now and would like you to square away your debt before then, so we can use those funds to help us move.\u201d\n\nWambach was the first to reply saying \u201cYou\u2019ll get my tax return. When we got back, Glennon\u2019s hours at work were cut and we\u2019re paycheck to paycheck again. Giving you my tax return is the only way we can pay you back.\u201d  Glennon eventually replied with just a question mark, which leads me to believe she didn\u2019t know the full extent of how much we had loaned them before I brought it up that day, but TBH that is just speculation on my part. Either way, the hubby and I agree to wait until tax season to be repaid, but from this day on, Wambach was noticeably more distant and colder to me in all our face-to-face interactions. Not rude or mean, but less friendly. Around this same time Wambach let us know she began proceedings with her ex, to terminate her parental rights to her son, which would stop her financial responsibilities as well.  That would have theoretically freed up more funds for Wambach and Glennon to budget or blow on frivolous things. But the process has been drawn out and to the best of my knowledge, I believe they\u2019re still figuring it out. \n\nNow, any normal person would assume that if someone you borrowed money from, is asking you to repay them, you wouldn\u2019t ask them for more money, but not Wambach. She periodically continued to ask my husband for more loans. Directly and indirectly, directly by texting him individually instead of in our group chat to ask for more money or indirectly by giving him a sob story about having to go without beers and chewing tobacco so she can afford to feed her 4 dogs, 4 cats and 2 fish that she had crammed into her little 2-bedroom apartment. Every request that she made from that point on, however, was still refused, and I had told my husband to make me the bad guy so she would be less likely to retaliate against him at work and make his remaining time at that base more difficult. The constant refusal contributed to Wambach\u2019s noticeably less favorable treatment of me, and between the time I confronted her and Glennon in the group chat to the following January, she would make periodic attacks on my character to my husband. I assume, hoping to drive us apart/divorce so she would have more access to his portion of our savings without me stopping her. This is the most noteworthy example, but not the only one. After her own promotion ceremony in October from E5 to E6, Wambach tried to convince my husband I was a narcissist, manipulative and financially abusing him, by not allowing him to give her more money. That\u2019s right, she tried to argue that I, who equally contributes to our joint savings and checking accounts, was financially abusing him, by refusing to allow him to give her more of our money! I wish I was witness to the mental gymnastics she had to perform to come to that conclusion because it would have been a spectacular and entertaining show, I\u2019m sure. Our plan was working, she didn\u2019t blame my husband for the lack of help anymore, Wambach blamed me as we wanted. But why jump to that conclusion instead of the more sensible and logical \u201cOh, they\u2019ve grown tired of my shit and my mooching ways. I should just stop.\u201d If anyone has insight into the mind of a narcissist, please let me know in the comments.\n\nWambach would always make these attacks on me at the facility they worked in or through texts and my husband would bite his tongue and just nod along to whatever she said. But at the end of his workday, he\u2019d recount everything that was said, and apologize to me for not defending me. I was almost always able to brush it off and not let it affect me as I had been able to reconnect with a good friend from high school who is also a military spouse, whose husband was recently stationed there as well. Let\u2019s call her Kat and her husband Sergeant First Class Foster. Kat and Foster introduce my hubby and I to their good friends and another army couple in the area, Regina and Sergeant First Class Hanks. While grabbing coffee with Kat and Regina, I let them know, in full detail about the situation my hubby and I were in with Glennon and Wambach and because they\u2019re amazing friends, they offered to talk to their husbands about it and see if they have any advice for us. Boy, did they ever! Foster and Hanks both advised us to do the same thing, take our revenge dossier to the chain of command at my husband\u2019s unit and get our money back immediately, because not only were Wambach\u2019s actions shady but also a gross breach of the code of conduct NCOs are supposed to follow. After talking it over with my husband, we decided we should wait until tax season to move forward with any potential action, as we did agree to wait and be paid back with Wambach\u2019s income tax return. \n\nThe holidays passed without major incidents and we\u2019re now in mid-January again. Wambach scheduled a shoulder surgery for herself and prepared to go on medical leave, at the end of the month. A week or so before she went on the leave, she sent my husband another private message. It read \u201cOnce the child support is cancelled and no longer being taken out of my check, I will send you $200 a month until I pay off what you lent me. I was going to use my tax return, but I want to pay off a bill with it to have fewer payments. I haven\u2019t forgotten to pay ya. Just needed this child support to go away and for Glennon\u2019s checks to be good again\u201d. \n\n  \n  My husband showed me the text and we crafted a reply together. We said \u201cI will talk it over with u/OsoSabroso and get back to you. Goodnight, see you later\u201d. It being late at night, my husband went to sleep and I began writing a stern but fair message to Wambach and Glennon explaining how we felt betrayed and hurt by their constant shady actions, reviewed every bullshit excuse they used on us and that our patience had ran out a long time ago. That we were giving them one final chance to pay us back, in full with their tax return or my Hubby and I would bring the matter to their chain of command and even small claims court if we needed to. I delayed sending it to Wambach and Glennon until my hubby was awake and able to share his input with me on the message, but there was a last-minute change in his work schedule, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to read it until late the following evening. That day while he was at work, Wambach and Glennon went into the facility to use the printer for some paperwork they needed to finalize her medical leave. According to my hubby, Wambach practically bursts into the room, and before saying hello or exchanging pleasantries of any kind, tells him quite adamantly that \u201cIf u/OsoSabroso doesn\u2019t like the changes (to the deal), you tell him he can kiss my ass\u201d. He manages to keep his cool in that moment, replying with a simple no, but is quite pissed while he\u2019s recounting what happened to me as we ate dinner. Over the course of the past year, it became clear to us that Wambach was just biding her time until we moved to cut contact with us and never repay us, this was our final straw. Husband and I decided that we\u2019re not giving them a final warning, we're just going to tap into our petty sides and just bring the matter to the chain of command and whatever happens to her, is the karma she deserves.\n\nWe followed the proper procedure and arranged a meeting with the company commander, a few days after she burst into the office. We come prepared with printouts from the dossier, screenshots and transaction receipts. The commander was very disappointed in Wambach and assured us that he would get the ball rolling on this. A few days later the commander reaches out to my husband and arranges for him to make a sworn statement in front of another member of the chain of command. The commander also asks me to prepare a statement to go into the report. While we\u2019re in the middle of all this, Wambach has gone on medical leave and isn\u2019t aware of the shit storm coming her way. Like any other workplace, our frequent meetings with higher ups got the attention of many and became the hot gossip of the unit. Luckily for us, it never got back to Wambach, and the exact details of why we were meeting so frequently with the chain weren\u2019t revealed either. Part of the reporting process was to share with command if we thought Wambach had taken advantage of any other lower enlisted soldiers, which caused my husband to drop a bomb on me and the command. Some of his co-workers had sworn him to secrecy but they revealed to him that they were in the exact same situation as we were. To keep their anonymity my husband only suggested that command speak to every lower enlisted soldier at the facility they worked in daily, and if they felt inclined to confide in them, then they could get their money back too. The commander thanked us for bringing the matter to his attention, assured us that he and the rest of the command chain were taking this very seriously, including the brigade commander (Company commander\u2019s boss), who personally took the time to meet with us and assured us that we would get all our money back before we moved away to hubby\u2019s next military assignment. \n\nTwo little wrenches were thrown in our plan, however. First, the Commander let us know that, while Wambach was on leave, she was untouchable. Command couldn\u2019t call her in for disciplinary action until she had been medically cleared to return to duty. Second Wambach\u2019s medical leave was extended when her shoulder wasn\u2019t healing as quickly as predicted.  It was extended until early March, which cut it very close for us, as we were scheduled to move away mid-March. Now this next little bit wasn\u2019t planned but it is my petty little cherry on top of my revenge. After Wambach\u2019s last dig at me in the office, I cut contact with her and Glennon, replying only when absolutely necessary in our group chat and only occasionally to keep up appearances so not to rouse suspicion of our bigger plan. During the final days of Wambach\u2019s medical leave, my awesome supportive husband was also promoted to E5, and would be receiving his own ceremony. A huge part of those ceremonies is choosing a family member or fellow soldier to do the honors and \u201cpin\u201d you with your new rank. Wambach had been eagerly waiting for my husband\u2019s promotion for months (my guess is that she was love bombing him and trying to ingratiate herself more on to him, in an attempt to make a rift between him and I) and in her head, she was the only clear choice to pin him, despite that it\u2019s the promoted person\u2019s choice. My husband invited his friends and co-workers and asked me to pin him at the ceremony. I was very happy to, and then he asked me if he should invite Wambach and Glennon to keep up appearances. I told him \u201cThis is your ceremony, in recognition of your hard work and efforts. You invite whoever you want. I can put up with Wambach for however long the ceremony is. Don\u2019t worry about me on your day.\u201d Being the awesome husband he is, he chose not to invite either Wambach or Glennon, and asked the chain of command not to discuss arrangements for the ceremony with Wambach as to keep her in the dark and from attending. The ceremony was a wonderful time for us. And happened a few days before Wambach was to return to work. Almost immediately when she reported back to work, she learned of the ceremony and was irate from what we heard through the grapevine. By this time my husband had already started the clearing process to move, so while still stationed in NY he wasn\u2019t on regular duty and so not in the facility any longer. Wambach sent my husband so many angry texts, which I asked him to ignore and let me reply to her.  Paraphrasing, I said something like \u201cHey, chill. When you busted into the office in January and said what you said about me, I chose to limit my contact with you and Glennon. I told my husband he doesn\u2019t need to do the same for my sake. So, when he was promoted, he asked me if he should invite you and I told him not to worry about me, that I can put up with your company for however long that ceremony was, and he thought about it and chose to put my comfort before you. So be mad at me if you have to but stop with the tantrum.\u201d This was the start of one of the worst days of her personal and professional life. \n\nLuckily for us, around the same time she was frantically and angrily texting us, the company commander, the facility manager, and another member of the chain of command pulled Wambach into a private room and presented a copy of our dossier to her without saying much. According to one of the members present Wambach\u2019s color drained out of her face as she flipped through the pages and she realized what was about to happen. By the time she reached the last page she was ugly sobbing and making promises to repay us and excuses as to why she did what she did. The commander silenced her, and told her she had until my Husband and I moved to pay us in full, failing could result in a loss in rank, an article 15 (expulsion from the military, possibly dishonorably) and that even if she did pay us by the deadline the report we made would be front and center in her personnel file, and would be the first thing seen by any of her future NCOs and commanders and would always hinder her ability to be promoted. I think that last part broke her because from what we\u2019ve gathered she tried to deflect on to me, by trying to convince the commander that I was a narcissist and financially abusing my husband, because after leaving that meeting with Wambach, the commander made a phone call to my husband to investigate Wambach\u2019s allegations. My husband denied them and defended me and that was the last we heard of it.\n\n  At this point we only have a few days left in NY and we\u2019re patiently waiting to be paid as we finish arranging our move. The day before we hit the road, one of the command team that was present at the meeting with Wambach, asked to meet up with hubby and I for coffee. We meet with them at a local coffee shop, and we make small talk. Really nothing of any consequence was discussed until I was answering one of their questions, and the command member reached into their coat pocket and pulls out a blank envelope filled with cash and places it on the table and slides it across to my hubby and I, like we\u2019re making a shady back-room drug deal. I trail off as I glance over at my husband, and he\u2019s glancing over at me. I stutter and ask, \u201cIs that from Wambach?\u201d The command member replies \u201cYes and no. It is the sum of money she owes you but it\u2019s not from her. It\u2019s from me. I can\u2019t discuss any more of the details of what happened that day with you, but Wambach heavily implied that paying you back in such a short amount of time would cause a lot of hardships for her and her wife. Realistically, I doubt she\u2019ll be paying you tomorrow, if ever. I discussed this with my spouse, and we don\u2019t believe you two should be punished for doing the right thing and helping someone in need. We can afford to give this amount to you. I only ask that you report to the commander that Wambach\u2019s debt was paid in full.\u201d I asked for a moment to talk it over with my husband and the command member gave us a few minutes alone. Ultimately my husband and I decided to refuse the money the command member was presenting to us. We could have played it safe, but as much as we were doing this to get even and our money back, we were doing it to protect other lower enlisted from the disgusting behavior being displayed by Wambach too. Accepting the money would be protecting her and letting her off the hook. We didn\u2019t want that. Wambach is a predator, taking advantage of lower enlisted soldiers who may not know their rights in the army.  We thanked them for their offer and left shortly after to continue our preparations. \n\nThe following day, we started our long road trip to my husband\u2019s new installation. We had been on the road for a few hours, when my husband got a notification on his phone, it was a Cash App transaction, from Wambach. Surprisingly she paid us the full amount she owed; I can\u2019t tell you just how shocked I was when my husband told me that. I swear my jaw must have been open and on the floor of my car for at least 5 miles before I came to my senses and told hubby to call the Company Commander and let him know we had been paid. That really put us in a great mood for the rest of the road trip, to have dealt some much-deserved justice to the villain of our story, especially after enduring the dozen or so bullshit excuses Wambach had given us over the past year.  \n\nThe last few weeks for us have been busy with unpacking, organizing and my husband checking into his new assigned installation. But we did make the time to call a few of hubby\u2019s former coworkers and friends in New York. According to many of them, Wambach is miserable, and I love that for her.  Wambach claims to miss my hubby but puts all the blame on me, because like the narcissist I believe she is, she can\u2019t imagine that she didn\u2019t always have my hubby under her thumb. She can die mad. In addition to the consequences I had already mentioned, she was ordered to stop any non-work-related communication with anyone E4 or below, she was also ordered to remove any lower enlisted member from her personal social media friends list. Wambach is incredibly mopey and low energy around the facility they work in everyday or irrationally pissed off, there is no in between.  Wambach had to use Glennon\u2019s entire paycheck to repay us, so Wambach is in hot water with her own wife, and I hope this whole ordeal opens Glennon\u2019s eyes to Wambach\u2019s true abusive and manipulative nature. That is my only real regret about this whole thing. Glennon, while complicit, is just another victim of the real narcissist in this story. She was truly a sweet and friendly person who my hubby and I both miss. If you happen to ever come across this post, I hope you get far away from Wambach and have a happy life, Glennon.",

But now looking back at it, it's pretty clear she was hoping we'd be ignorant of the code and be unable to learn about it to keep her con going.\n\nBut there is hope that she will be removed from the military. As I mention my husband did imply that there was several other lower listed who she did take advantage of. If anyone or more of them come forward it'll prompt an investigation into her behavior and hopefully get her booted. If not she already has a very big strike against her any other major infraction or probably even minor fuck up could get her discharged.  The chain of command is now aware of her, and for all the wrong reasons.",

Lent them about 500 in total, easily a month or two pays in the day. \nWhen I asked to pay it back etc, they would place me on shit duties and smoke me at random. \nI said they would report them, they laughed and said I would suffer and be known as a shit bag and never be promoted. \nLuckily I changed units, and just ate the lesson. \nGlad it worked out for the two of you!",

    "postText": "There is this front desk lady at my local library who is always so rude and lazy. She would cut me off mid-sentence when I ask a question. She implied that I stole someone else's on-hold book. She always had a nasty tone. After several unpleasant exchanges, I made a point to always let her check out my books, without ever thanking her. Even better, if her coworker is next to her, I say something nice to the coworker without even acknowledging her. I hope this drives her nuts.\n\nSome say kill rudeness with kindness. But it simply doesn't work on some people, who confuse kindness with weakness, and take advantage of it. I say give them 3 chances, then make them feel absolutely worthless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: typo",

It was bliss.  \nThen the pandemic happened, it temporarily closed, then I moved to a different town that is more affluent and has one of the highest percentage of college grads per capita in Illinois, so - arguably better educated.  \nThe library might as well be Union Station at afternoon rush.  Nobody talks quietly, children shrieking and running around- not just in the children\u2019s library either - phone yakkers in the stacks, employees loudly discussing their own thing at the desk, and not really a great selection.  \nNow, I pre-order books and pick them up (we have the self-serve reserve shelves as well) and get the heck out.  I don\u2019t know if this library has always been like this or if it\u2019s more post-covid cluelessness I observe elsewhere, but the library is not my happy place any longer.",

Sometimes big-city folks aren't as considerate as those living in smaller towns.\n\nThe deterioration happened to the very same library that I'd been going to for 20 years. Nowadays there are teenagers socializing loudly in the Quiet study areas. To them, \"quiet\" probably means quieter than their usual demeanor (i.e. shrieking and guffawing). So talking like normal adults absolutely counts as being \"quiet\". Every word is audible even if one sits at the other end of the floor. Since there are hundreds of them, the entire 6-floor library hums with their noise. I wish these teenagers would just lift their heads out of their own asses and look around once in a while.\n\nThe library staffs ignore this entirely.",

    "postText": "Firstly, a huge thanks to everyone who showed support for and enjoyed my last post. I\u2019ve been asked to write some more of the crazy things that happened in my marriage. This one is another tale that involves some petty revenge, so I\u2019ll keep this one here before writing others in the subs they belong in. \n\nLet me preface this story with the fact that I know I was dumb and stayed too long. The more of these I write, the dumber I\u2019ll look. Not going to explain why again here, so you can find my last thread if you\u2019re interested in some additional backstory. It\u2019s recommended so you can follow this one better. TL;DR at the bottom. Here we go\u2026 \ud83d\ude2c\n\nBackstory:\n\nAbout 6 months prior to moving away for my promotion (Sept 2018) with the family, my ex-wife had gotten pretty bad from a delusions standpoint with the whole \u201cseeing ghosts and demons\u201d stuff. She was supposedly scared to be at home alone with the kids. My job at the time required for me to be gone for periods from a week up to several months at a time. And that could have been alleviated some if she would have gotten a job to contribute financially, but she refused to take a \u201clow paying\u201d job after having her nursing license revoked by the state. I should have been more vocal, but I wasn\u2019t. I was paid well, and up to this point, to my knowledge, she had been faithful. She was raising the 3 kids at home and used her free time during the day to work on rehab projects for the little house we had bought. \n\nOne day, I come back from a job in the Spring of 2018 and her cousin by marriage (no blood relation), let\u2019s call him John, was there. She gave me a quick summary of them growing up together, how he had come to help her haul something back from the hardware store, etc. The guy seemed alright, but she seemed overly nervous about him while he was playing it totally cool. This is also the first time she ever introduced me to one of her targets by the way! Either way, he hung out for about 15 minutes to not have it be weird and then excused himself and left. I didn\u2019t see or hear about him again for several months. He apparently secretly stopped by quite often when she was feeling extra exorcist-ish. \n\nTo jump back a bit further and explain where the angel/demob paranoia came from, my ex had birthed our daughter in late 2016, and by Spring 2017 she was not happy with the weight she had gained and also was suffering from some mild postpartum. This led to her falling back into her drug use (meth) to quickly lose weight. I had known about her previous pill addictions, but not about the harder stuff til after I caught her with it late that spring.  A huge fight ensued, she promised to quit and go to NA, I accepted and we tried to move on. Most of the rest of 2017 was her continually slipping into the use of pills or meth and a prolonged manic episode. It finally got to the point that I was ready to leave it things didn\u2019t change, and everything settled down around Christmas 2017 and was actually pretty solid through mid-2018. I think her manic episode chilled out around that Christmas. \n\nBack to Summer 2018 though, John was popping up a lot in our daily conversations out of nowhere. He was coming over and helping do a lot of physical labor (ha) working on the house with my ex. At least once during the week and almost every weekend. Always when I was gone for jobs. He never was around when I was home. Strange.\n\nEventually, I caught them together and the blame for it was directed at me because I was \u201calways gone and never around to help.\u201d  Mind you what I said above about the finances. If she worked even a crappy job, I could have afforded to be home another 2-3 months out of the year. And funnily enough, John turned out to be unemployed too, so they had all the time in the world to play happy couple while I worked 80+ hour weeks on the road about 40-44 weeks a year. I was boiling furious. I filed for divorce for the first time and she flipped out. Begged and pleaded. Said it was done and over and how sorry she was. This is what led, in part, to us moving away for the promotion and getting a \u201cfresh start\u201d in the fall of 2018. \n\nThe Act: \n\nBy summer of the next year (2019), her phone was constantly blowing up with texts from someone and she had them in her phone as \u201cJennifer and  Jacob\u201d (names changed). She said her Aunt back home was very ill, and that was another cousin that was keeping her updated on her condition. That ended up being a lie.\n\nNow, she wasn\u2019t tech savvy in the slightest, and when she changed iPhones, she had me back hers up on the family computer and move everything over to the new one. The texts kept coming, and I eventually had enough suspicions that used a program to pull the backup open and dump her texts history. \n\nAs I read through, I discovered that \u201cJennifer and Jacob\u201d was really just Jacob. And there weren\u2019t any talks of her Aunt going on at all. What there was though was a ton of flirting going on. Dirty pics and videos flying back and forth. I confronted her on the findings after processing it all for about a week. I was heartbroken to find out that nothing had changed. Of course, I was the bad guy for not trusting her and breaking her privacy by reading the messages. She filled me in on who he really was, which was John\u2019s adopted brother who lived a few hours away. She didn\u2019t have an explanation this time as to why she did it. But she claimed to have went to see him at some point and tried to hook up, but apparently he wasn\u2019t able to perform that night, so they never managed to go all the way. My new job was in a manager\u2019s position running a division at my company, and I was home every night. She would say she was going somewhere for a couple days and needed a \u201cbreak\u201d from the responsibilities of a full time stay at home mom. Usually, it was to a family member\u2019s place which all lived a minimum of 3 hours away, depending which direction you went. \n\nAt this point, I didn\u2019t know when it would finally be over, but I knew it was coming. The only reason I didn\u2019t fold right then was the financial position we were in. We had overextended ourselves on the new home we purchased based on the idea that she would become gainfully employed after we moved, which never happened. We were living paycheck to paycheck on a mid-$100k salary, all the credit cards were maxed out, and I couldn\u2019t figure out a way to escape without bankruptcy (the route I ended up having to take). \n\nThere was so much else going on in terms of drama and arguing, that this was just another blip on the radar. I was mentally defeated up until the events happened from the previous post. Those events, for anyone who didn\u2019t go read there first, triggered me filing for divorce. \n\nThe Revenge:\n\nEarly into 2020, the divorce was going about how one would expect dealing with a spouse like this one, atrociously. I was broken down and looking back at how much of a joke I had let myself become. One night, deep in those thoughts and about half a fifth of Crown Royal, I wondered what this other guy\u2019s life was like. I looked him up. He had a family. Two kids. Beautiful wife. Perfect looking from the outside on Facebook. Jacob\u2019s wife looked like a genuinely sweet and caring person. It got me wondering if she knew what had happened, or if he skated by without a scratch. Jennifer didn\u2019t have a Facebook, but she did have an Instagram. \n\nI sent her a message that gently explained what I had discovered several months prior. I wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever respond. When she did, it was even more sad that she said she had known of my ex and had suspicions, but couldn\u2019t ever prove it and wished I had told her sooner. She then told me she also knew that my ex and John were dating because my ex and I had gotten divorced, which was categorically untrue, but she said that\u2019s what John told her! And lastly, Jennifer said that Jacob did this sort of thing a lot, but always stopped short of hooking up. My guess is Guilt D\\*ck stopped him? No clue. \n\nJennifer wanted some proof so she could believe what I was saying and also as evidence in her soon to be divorce. I gathered up the exported texts, videos, and pics and sent them over to her. I warned her the texts would hurt a lot more than the sexts. After reading, she agreed. I apologized but said at least she knew the truth before she wasted too much time on him. We never spoke again after that. \n\nWithin a week, Jacob apparently got my number from my ex and he started blowing me up with texts. He said I played my hand well and congratulations. His marriage was over and all he had to blame for it was himself. I largely ignored him other than to say he should have respected what he had and not also contributed to destroying the life I had. I blocked him after that. I wasn\u2019t out to destroy his life, but rather to make his wife aware of the circle of scum we were both trapped in and let her handle it how she wished. \n\nIt was a somber victory, but a victory none the less.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy ex cheated on with me with her cousin by marriage, then attempted to again down the road with his adopted brother. My rough divorce had me reflecting on how foolish I was, and I reached out to the second one\u2019s wife to expose the adopted brother for the POS he is. She is thankful and handles it on her end. He ends up contacting me saying his marriage is over, well played, and he can only blame himself. \n\nObligatory legal clarification on the transmittal of the graphic photos and videos to Jennifer: \n\nMy ex tried to nail me for sending \u201crevenge photos\u201d to Jacob\u2019s ex. I had my attorney that was handling my criminal case review this claim and he shrugged it off. Nowhere in any of the photos or videos was anything that could identify Jacob or my ex. Due to that fact, he said it didn\u2019t hold weight and it wouldn\u2019t go anywhere. It ultimately did not go anywhere. \n\nBonus: There\u2019s a lot more to John\u2019s story with my ex that I haven\u2019t covered due to not being relevant to the ending of this one.",

I did so much for him to help him climb the ladder, now he makes more than $100k and whines that he has to pay it because he thinks he did it on his own. He couldn't do the paperwork to get a job. Not my problem anymore; not my circus, not my monkeys. I am wary of the world around me now, though.\n\nOP - see, you have nothin' on me when it comes to being a fool and staying too long. I have a new mantra, though: Give me harsh reality rather than false hope, any and every day. \n\nMy ex is like teflon don, he's not had karma bite him in the butt since the divorce. He found a pigeon who has monetary value to him and married her right away for the tax write off. I have stories, too, but even with a throw away account it would have to be too detailed to explain the depths he went to without family recognizing the tales of his stunts.\n\nEdit: rephrased and deleted a few things that were too specific",

I\u2019ll bet divorcing and moving on feels really good\u2026 I\u2019m never happy at hearing the demise of any relationship, and I do understand why you think you were dumb by staying. I don\u2019t think you are tho. I only read how you tried to keep your family together the only way you could, whilst working an insane job, and trying to handle a partner with mental health issues as well as drug addiction. That obviously wasn\u2019t sustainable and you reached a point where you broke. It was either you, or her. Glad you picked you for your kids sake!\n\nI\u2019m going to go catch myself up on your updates now. Thank you so much for sharing the good, the bad and the ugly\u2026",

    "postText": "So I'm married to a wonderful woman. She's smart, funny and very kind.\n\nHer mother is generally very nice and tends to have a great attitude and be very enjoyable, a bit of a prude but generally enjoyable, however can be a bit of a major snoop. If my wife leaves her phone sitting around she will just pick it up and start going through it. My wife has kind of laughed this off as a remnant of her mom being controlling when she was a kid. \n\nI'm not a fan of this because my wife and I will sometimes text about thing that simply don't involve her mother and I don't feel are hee business at all. \n\nSo over Christmas my I saw my wife set her phone down on the kitchen counter and I had a brilliant idea. Her mom was still in the kitchen and I sent my wife the most sexually depraved text about all the things I was going to do to her when everyone left. (Honestly most of them are things we haven't even done, but I had to make it extra scarring ...)\n\nI sent this text from the bathroom. And maybe it was my imagination but I could swear I could hear an audible ghasp shortly after her phone went off.\n\nWhen I went out her mother absolutely would not look me in the eye. Then not-so-discreetly asked her daughter to come talk to her in the other room. \n\nWhen my wife came back into the living room I thought she had been crying, however upon closer inspection she was laughing. Her mother had questioned her about me sexually abusing her and if I always talk down to her like that.\n\nMy wife had told her kindly that what we do is between us and us only. Probably the best gift this christmas. ",

I\u2019ve always been secretive about my devices because I\u2019m a sexual deviant and you can find some not-so-family-things by a click of a button. But the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was when I was moving into my dorm freshman year of college. I was sleeping with/almost dating my best friend who also made it into the same university as me. He was helping me move in with my family. We left to get more stuff from the car (and also messed around for a minute *cough*) and came back. My mom had went through a bag of mine and opened a letter.\n\nThis is a letter he wrote me because we exchanged them a few months prior with the intent of opening them 5 years later to see how we and our relationship grew. It was unopened. She literally tore through it and read the letter he sent me. It\u2019s not like it could\u2019ve been mistaken for anything but a personal letter. Luckily, he didn\u2019t put anything explicitly romantic in there. But my mom still had a talk with me about the possibility of him liking me, and proceeded to tell me he would be a bad choice because XYZ. She even teared up when she asked if we have \u201cdone anything\u201d and I told her no. \n\nAt that point I lost all trust in her and I don\u2019t let any of my materials to be easily accessible to her. It\u2019s also why my life in general is a secret from both her and my dad. They don\u2019t know I\u2019m nonreligious, they don\u2019t know I\u2019m bisexual, they don\u2019t know that while I\u2019m clean on the alcohol/drugs department sex is a whole other story. And they never will. My mom has gotten slightly better over the years but I\u2019m not risking that incident repeating again.\n\nOh, and I\u2019m still with the same guy 4 years later",

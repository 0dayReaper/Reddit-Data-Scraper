    "postText": "This happened years ago but still makes me smile.   I started working in a corporate office in a secretarial position for my first job after college.  There were two older ladies who were also secretaries working in the office.   One of them was just fine, but I spent most of my time sitting beside and working with Agnes.   Agnes was quickly approaching retirement age but wasn\u2019t going anywhere without a big push.   This was in the days where we just started getting computers and she was absolutely hopeless.   She\u2019d pull stuff like \u201cI can\u2019t answer the phone - I\u2019m on the computer.\u201d   Multi-tasking was not in this woman\u2019s repertoire.   She was super fussy, and annoying.   If I ever came back from lunch 5 minutes late, she would exclaim loudly \u201cOMG - there you are!   I was wondering what had happened to you!\u201d, making sure the whole office knew I was late.  Meanwhile, she was usually late coming in in the morning, and often left early for various appointments.   If I made a typo in a document, she would make sure the rest of the staff knew about it, loudly.\n\nShe tended to pout when when things didn\u2019t go her way, and she would \u201cquit\u201d her job when someone pissed her off, and then my boss\u2019s boss would talk her into staying.   I\u2019d heard about this tactic of hers and one day, our boss did something that annoyed her and she \u201cquit\u201d again.  My boss\u2019s boss was away that day so I had my chance.  I quickly advertised and planned a big retirement party for her.  It was a done deal by the end of the day.   People were dropping by and congratulating her and everyone looked forward to the party.   At that point, I guess she figured it was too late to pull her usual shenanigans and she actually retired.   I told my boss to not bother replacing her because it was damn easy to cover the little work she actually accomplished every day.   ",

I've always heard Shrodinger's Douchebag applied to peopke who make racist, sexist, or otherwise inappropriate jokes, and then decide if they're kidding based on the reaction of those around them. I see the similarities here, with the \"I was only joking/didn't mean it\" but it seems like more of a manipulation technique to get what they want in this case. They never intended on not taking it back, it seems.\n\nIs there some other pithy, fun name we call this group, or do we group them in with Shrodinger's Doushebags? I'm having fun thinking on this!",

I was young and stupid and a poor college student who needed her as a roommate for cheap rent so I just let her do it knowing she didn't mean it. Sure enough days later she's calling herself my girlfriend again and acting like nothing ever happened. \n\nOne time she did it right before my birthday and a mutual friend of ours was throwing me a birthday party that my gf couldn't go to because of work. I slept with that friend at the party and started seeing her. A few days later my ex called my new girl at 2am saying that when I didn't come home she drove past her house and saw my car there. She starting crying and asking \"why MY girl?!\" New girl shrugged, said \"you broke up\", and hung up her phone while my ex could be heard screaming \"I didn't mean it!!!\".\n\nI moved out of that ex's place a few weeks later, had to pay double rent for 6 months (worth it), and 9 years later I'm happily married to birthday sex gal. Ex got married too; after she found out I was married. Literally announced her engagement after she learned about mine despite her relationship being like 3 months old at that point. One of those weird counter-marriages that exes sometimes do. I hope she's as happy as I am.",

The lawyers wife didn't even have a real job but was always butting in and she had it out for the office manager. One time they were planning an office move and kept everything secret from the office manager. There was not a lot to it because there are only 4 employees counting the wife. Friday evening they have movers come and Saturday morning IT sets it all up. The husband would go along with what his wife asked more often than not and approved of the manager being fired over the weekend. Come Monday the office is just locked and when the office manager calls in all we can say is to talk to the company owner as her access had been terminated. The wife didn't even let her know she was fired or the office moved. She got hired back on a few weeks later with retro pay before moving to a better job later in the year. ",

He isn't an old bat like Agnes.\n\nWhenever he gets assigned to a major project that he doesn't want, he hands in his resignation letter and goes through the motions of leaving. Once we fill the position with another person, he'll magically change his mind and take his resignation back. He's done it 4 or 5 times.\n\nHe could literally just say no but he didn't want to look like he wasn't a team player. I was offered some of the same roles before him but I said no (with valid reasons of course).",

    "postText": "Pulling into work this morning, I was behind a car that was obviously going to back into a parking spot, because of the way she positioned herself and the fact that her reverse lights came on. I politely waited on her to make the maneuver but she just sat there. I waved and smiled at her and told her to go ahead and back in. She blew her horn at me for a long time and aggressively waved me to drive on. I could see her mouth form the words \"you stupid motherf\\*&amp;\\*er\", so I pulled into the space she was about to back into, got out and told her good morning as I walked by.",

The exception is when 2 vehicles arrive at the same time, so no one got there \"first.\" \n\nIf the two cars are perpendicular to each other, the car on the right hand side has right of way.  If they are facing each other and both going straight (or turning so that they won't cross paths), they can go at the same time. But if one is going straight and the other is turning left, the one going straight has right of way. \n\nThe problem is only when the driver with right of way tries to be \"nice\" (or don't actually know the rules) and let the other go first. It doesn't happen a lot simply because people don't usually arrive at an intersection that close together. But drive enough and it'll happen from time to time.",

As you said, you're reversing into an enclosed space, so it's going to be harder to get your positioning perfect so you're not slanted across the parking spot, too close on one side of the other, etc. But when you're backing out of a parking spot, you're backing into a wide-open area where the only positioning that matters is getting out far enough to then be able to drive forward and continue on your way. Sure, there may be people or cars, but in that case you simply wait a couple of seconds and then go. I can't imagine a situation where it's quicker to make adjustments while backing into a spot than out of one.",

I go to back in, and after I pull forward and put the car in reverse, I have had cars zip around me... BEHIND ME. This has happened at least 4 times this year alone. And I use my turn indicator to indicate I am taking a parking spot on my right...\n\nSo, there is a very good likelihood that this person, doesn't trust anyone to drive correctly.

If you front into a parking spot, you have to reverse INTO the traffic driving by, while not being able to see much of whats coming from either side. If you reverse into a spot, there is no traffic in the area you are reversing into, and when you pull out from the spot, its much easier to see whats coming from wither side. Really, the only times fronting in is a better option is a) at some big box stores (e.g. Sam's, BJ's, Costco) or other retailer you visit that necessitates you putting stuff in your trunk, or b) when it is legally required",

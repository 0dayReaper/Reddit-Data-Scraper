    "postText": "I live in an apartment building that is...oddly designed to say the least. My bedroom window directly faces the bedroom window of another apartment with about 6 feet between. Problem is, the windows have no sound proofing and my bedroom window buddies accross the way have LOUDEST sex I've ever heard. Like I can hear it through noise cancelling headphones type of loud (and those headphones completely drowned out fireworks being set off in the parking lot next door on 4th of July). I have insomnia and they have woken me up/interrupted that moment right before I fall asleep with these awful sounds. Like go for it but stop screaming the whole time and telling \"daddy\" how hes doing for all to hear.\n\nThey also keep a ridiculous amount of crap in the hallway. A stack of shoeboxes as tall as me and probably 10 shoeboxes long, dog food, food odor powder, about 20 more pairs of shoes not in boxes, cleaning stuff, a whole ass side table, and more. It's disrespectful and they are shitty people (they do more inconsiderate things than what I am sharing). \n\nBecause of the insomnia and the fact I'm moving out soon, I've decided to be a bit mischievous. I made sure there were no doorbell cams and the building doesn't have cameras and now a few times a week when I can't sleep I walk down the hall in the middle of the night and move some things around and kind of hide at least one thing. All very subtle. I hope it makes them question their sanity when things arent where they left them. If I see foot odor powder on the windowsill again I'm chucking that shit out the window without hesitation.\n\nEdit: just a few extra details for clarity. I tried the diplomatic route and left a note about the noise first. I'm also doing literally the least bc I'm a goody two shoes and unnecessary conflict isn't my jam (although I still find your suggestions very entertaining). Im really just slightly messing with a few things and going teehee to myself bc I am lame and think it's funny. When I'm awake at some ridiculous time of night, sometimes it's cathartic. Also, when I say moving out \"soon\" its still about a month and half of this every single night and a lot of days. For those getting on their high horse and trying to say I'm immature or, and I quote, \"a peice of shit\"...look at the subreddit you're on lol. I've moved three things so far. It barely qualifies as petty even",

At one point I said I was surprised there weren't turnstiles on the fire escapes requiring payment. That's how bad. Also complaints from me would not be well received bc when I gave my notice to vacate I began a war with my property manager over the several illegal fees he told me were required. I won that war for the most part but they don't want to hear from me I guarantee it.",

But one just need to walk a few feet down to get to the washroom. But damn the guys have been squeezing behind our stools... Accidentally (or not) rubbing their dicks on our back. We girls looked at each other really disturbed... Then when next guy squeezed past each one of us started saying 2inch, 3inch, too small etc... That was hilarious. The guys didnt catch on until we started showing finger measurement estimates. Haha... They stopped going to the gents via the path behind us..\ud83d\ude02",

And the shared space between the windows is a 3 story drop so it would make the people on the first floor suffer. Also I dont have a shotgun and i live in the city so shooting in some random direction I'm pretty sure is super illegal. Trouble is not the goal I'm very much a goody two shoes and am already patting myself on the back for moving their stuff around. I'm not willing to go much further than being the mystery nighttime goblin who shuffles things around",

You quietly butt the dust pan up against the bottom of the door. Spread talcum powder in the pan.  Then quietly pour the water in the pan. Water scoots under the door into the entry area and the talcum powder floats on the surface. \n\nAnother fun thing to do is squirt toothpaste into the door keylock. Get one of those mini-tubes, and just butt the tube opening against the keylock opening, then squeeze.  Zinc Oxide is another good thing for door keylocks.  You can buy the cooling grease used on computer microprocessors between the processor and the cooling heatsink. Squirt that in the lock. After they use the key to gain entry, they get tat stuff all over their fingers when handling the key.  Most guys put their key in their pant's pocket and it gets all over their pants.  Leaves white spots, sort of like they  engaged in coitus while dressed.\n\nThe m-80, well it is an overgrown firecracker. Makes a big boom. The shotgun can be used in place of the M80, simply unpack the shot in the shell, fold the shell back up and when needed aim upwards to the sky and PULL!  You are almost guaranteed to cause the wild weasel to fly forward at maximum velocity and that usually ends the moaning quickly.",

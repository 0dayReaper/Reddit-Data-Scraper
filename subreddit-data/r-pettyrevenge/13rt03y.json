    "postText": "Probably not \u201cpetty\u201d revenge but one of the best stories I was given blessings to follow through with from the chair of the department. Spoiler, student got what they earned. \n\nYears ago I was a grad student teaching a 101 or 102 (beginner/intro) course in the department.  A few weeks in the withdrawal period for classes ends. My students got their grades up to that point, in person and posted online (because sometimes that gives them an idea if they want to withdraw from the class) as well as emailed some students that never showed up since day one or stopped that first week but clearly hadn\u2019t gotten around to officially dropping the course.\n\nI emailed one student (let\u2019s call her Kate) that never even showed up to the first day but was still on my online roster (therefore they had an F in my class). I emailed Kate about this and asked they withdraw from the course (rude that they hadn\u2019t as it prevented other students from joining that first 2 week add/drop period). \n\nDon\u2019t have the response anymore but remember Kate responded rather confused and aggressively sure she has been in my class since day one! Now, I had had some issues my first semester with my emails going to a different instructor in a different department who just happened to have the same first and last name as me, and since the university gave out emails as a combination of your first and last name this caused issues, which were mostly fixed by the time I reached this situation but left some room for me to question exactly what was going on here. I sent another email confirming her name, MY name, the class that she was registered for and the class room number and time. Kate wrote back adamant that she was in fact showing up for my class. I asked her to then come speak with me in class or come talk to me during office hours (and giving her that info since I knew she didn\u2019t have the syllabus). \n\nWell Kate never did show up! At midterms Kate got an F and another email from me. Don\u2019t believe I got a response and apparently seeing the F online was not a cause for concern? I let it be, other grad students and professors told me to leave it alone too as there was really nothing I could do. It became a bit of a silly story and from time to time people would ask for updates on this ridiculously confused student and we\u2019d share theories. \n\nSo around finals guess who I hear back from?! Kate is panicked cause she sees she is failing my class (no shit! I literally warned her no less than 4 times and grades had been posted for weeks!) and has realized her mistake was *drum roll* she had gone to the class room on the other side of the hall all semester\u2026???\u2026to a completely different class(subject) with an instructor with a different name and gender (our names are both clearly gender specific). Now, none of that tipped her off. NOT being on his class roster didn\u2019t tip her off, nor did my string of emails before midterm? My warnings of her F I would have to give her if she didn\u2019t drop? (No she wasn\u2019t an ESL/ELL I found out later). \n\nWell so that instructor that added Kate to his class roster was actually the new chair of the department. He had a little laugh about the situation (really he was also kind of at fault for letting it get that far as no one checked she had the prerequisites for his class, surely this involved some kind of \u201coverride\u201d in the system adding students that way so may have needed a manual check of their credits which obviously wasn\u2019t done). He helped me through the decision to fail her (or I think my other option was to give her an incomplete? Something with some paperwork and shit that I just didn\u2019t have time to figure out for her as a student myself the week before finals on top of my own class and other TA positions). I told him about all the emails I had sent her and tried to clarify all class info and asked her to come to my office or class to talk and she never showed, I think he lost more sympathy for her than I did. Kate was pleading with me to do anything but give her a failing grade and I was a busy grad student. (I also learned from the chair that she was not an English as a second language student, so I really couldn\u2019t see any excuse for her confusion at all). Honestly I was pissed she had the nerve to come to me at all after blowing me off all semester and basically telling me I was mistaken, she was going to her correct classes (like I don\u2019t know the 20 students I have by name??) and then putting it on me to help her out? Chair told me she deserved whatever I decided but kind of seemed to lean toward failing her. So I stopped responding to her emails (returning the favor she paid me at midterms) and just submitted her failing grade which felt both satisfying and terrible since it was in my power to give her an incomplete, but eff it, she didn\u2019t even earn an incomplete. \n\nSurely no one could be this dense so our theory was she really just wanted to take his class over mine as they were different subjects? Icing on top for this ignorance/self righteous stubbornness; she was getting an A or B in his class but since she didn\u2019t have the prerequisites (MY CLASS for one) to actually be in his class she wasted her time, money (as she wasted my class and added the other she paid for both) and will have to retake it (unless they made some exception for her, like hold the credits until she passed the prerequisites? They goofed too so I hope they did something like that, even if she did do all this on purpose, she earned her grade in that class she had no business in taking). \n\nIn short, don\u2019t cut corners when it comes to your education kids, it\u2019s just more work on the other side. Also learn your freakin\u2019 instructors names!\n\n\nEdit: \nEnglish was this students first language\n\nI have no idea what the final decision about the grade and credits for the class she was attending was, I was far to busy and sick to honestly care. They were likely held until she completed prerequisites or given but taken away at if she didn\u2019t complete them by graduation. I don\u2019t remember if she was a major or if removing this would affect her scholarships or financial aid.\n\nLast when I started grad school at this university there was a whole mess in the registrars office and financial aid, people retiring and some quitting unexpectedly? It messed up almost every student\u2019s financial aid and some peoples classes that had previously posted before the beginning of school. A year or year and a half later this situation happened, and while most issues were corrected, it was still happening on a smaller scale. Most professors in my department anyways were being patient and took students for their word with scheduling or financial aid issues. Idk what had to line up exactly for this to happen but it was obvious several people goofing, starting with the student and then our department and registrars office. Clearly things were overridden without a manual check on her credits/courses, likely because of what had happened the year before and this student was so adamant (whether it was a lie or she truly believed it so) it was an error on the schools end.",

I was watching people file out of the room and thought I recognized a couple faces, so I sat down and checked the copy of my schedule I had in my bag. Sure enough, I was an hour late and the class was over. That was an amusing class too. A flunk out physics class for architecture and design students where the professor was attempting to demonstrate thermal expansion and let an iron ring cool a little too long around an iron ball. I still remember him saying, \"How am I going to fix this? They're both the same metal so expand at the same rate!\"",

A freshman just... didn't come to class.  He was somehow under the impression that as long as he took and passed the final exams that he'd pass the courses.  So he did just that, he showed up the very last week of class and expected to be able to sit his final exams.\n\nMy university had an attendance policy.  If you're absent six times, you fail.  Most of the instructors were pretty casual about it and would cut you all kinds of slack if you talked to them.  But this guy didn't even show up the first day to get the syllabus (syllabi?) from his teachers.  Every single instructor flunked him by week three based solely on attendance.\n\nBut bless his heart, this dude just had no idea at all.  He'd showed up to the campus to register and then just... never came back.  So he had never activated his student email address or checked his registration or anything.\n\nThe school wouldn't let him register for spring semester because ethics, apparently.  They said he could take an 099 class in the spring about how college works or wait and register again in the fall without taking that class.  But it would be unethical to take his money for a second semester under the circumstances.  He ended up signing up for a welding school instead.  No idea how he did there.  \n\nBTW, this wasn't an eighteen year old.  He was in his mid-twenties.",

My education career was actually fairly convoluted. I absolutely loved my Masters program. At the end of high school I was just completely burnt out with the useless hoops and busywork. Facing the first two semesters of a computer science degree, where I didn't get to touch/learn anything relevant to the field, was too much for me.\n\n\n(Huge wall of text removed. I love telling my story, but here is probably not the right place).\n\n\nEdit to add: the point I wanted to make was that I can see how my life could have turned out equal or \"better\" if I had taken the gap, and not gone back. I think everyone should take a gap year especially because they might find the freedom.",

It removed a lot of the stress about being somewhere at a certain time for the exam, and some people preferred to get it done early while others would rather sleep in and take the exam after lunch or something.\n\nThey were never worried about students taking the exam first thing telling later students what the questions were.

When it was time for the exam it turns out that in the lecture hall right next to the one where I was having my exam an exam \"Algorithms and Datastructes\" was happening at the exact same time. It was a course for non computer science students that also needed some of the contents. So it would have been super easy to walk into the wrong room and you probably would only notice it too late if you did. But as far as I know everyone found the correct room :D",

Sounds like they just decided to get back at her for \"trying to take the other course without his prereq one\" when I think it was far more likely that she mistakenly enrolled with the wrong code and thought she was in the right place. The waste of time and money by marking her incomplete would have been more than enough punishment. The fail on top of that was just being petty nasty.",

I didn\u2019t get mine until December. So messes like students showing up saying they had signed u and had it on their schedule at some point but aren\u2019t showing up on our roster weren\u2019t uncommon that first semester as a grad student, wasn\u2019t uncommon to have one or two in the years that followed either.

Could you skip a head? Maybe, depends on the class and instructor but you are still going to miss the foundation classes that really work on teaching you the language, terms, history, important people of your subject, and principles etc. \n\nThe way a lot of colleges are designed too, beginning courses are more frequent and larger. Higher courses might only be offered once a year or once a semester. Students drop majors, switch majors or transfer all the time, so working from the bottom up helps weed people out, especially in competitive fields. She could have taken that spot away from a student planning on majoring in the subject, our department was small, probably wouldn\u2019t exist without grad students teaching the lower courses.\n\nI also have no idea if this student was planning on majoring in this subject either, it was something that with some great high school teachers she might have been able to get As or Bs in his class, especially if she was showing up and putting in the effort outside of class.",

I've marked for classes and if you get something handed in for someone who is not on the class list you know about it real quick even if it's because someone has enrolled with a different name to what's on the paper. (Happens occasionally with overseas students who take \"English\" names and they write the wrong one. You check out what's going on with the enrollment and then if all ok the marks go through.) Not to mention most classes I've seen these days require you to be registered in the class for access to online resources and submissions.\n\nHow did this girl get through an entire semester without the university noticing? I mean where were they recording her marks she was getting? Sounds like someone (other teacher or admin) royally messed up here as well.",

If your class was merely a prerequisite for the one she was doing well in, who gives a crap?  What she was doing was not malicious - she wasn't blowing off the class, she was just genuinely confused.  Yeah, she should have seen the grades online and fixed it, or listened to you better, but it seems mostly an irresponsible, yet accidental, mistake.  That you could have given her an incomplete but chose to fail her, fucking her in a most cruel way, setting her back like that?, just terrible.  What if she can't afford to stay in college now?

Fortunately it was a pretty simple class and the one class on campus that didn't have an attendance requirement, so I kept up with the reading and decided to go on exam days. Except... I got an email a week before the midterm from a professor whose name I didn't recognize about how the midterm \\*had gone\\* the day before. Cue panic: I hadn't been to class enough to be confident in my professor's name, and this was before the time of online portals so I couldn't check. I freaked out, emailed back the whole explanation, went to his office to talk it out... where we discovered that my name had somehow made it on to the roll of another section of the same class in addition to the one I was enrolled for. No wonder my recurring nightmare is trying to get across campus to an exam I forgot about in a class I've never been to...",

(I'd say that's far more likely than deliberately blowing off the ops or attending the wrong class thinking it was another all semester). \n\nAnd it was an idiot move on her part not to go sort it out with her when you offered. So you were in no way obligated to be kind. \n\n\nBuut she was successfully completing the other course which I think discounts the slacker theory and who on earth in the other course was making her????? You said she was getting As and Bs. How was that being recorded????  You have to enter in marks into a computer system. Surely someone had to have manually added her name instead of checking her enrollment details which is bad. The university has to really take some responsibility there as if a student is getting their attendance marked off and getting assignments marked, then they're going to assume their enrollment is ok. \n\nHonestly did sound really petty you failed rather than incompleted her. Sounds like you decided to take it as a personal insult she was trying to skip your class which she turned out not to need if she can get As in the other, rather than a giant mix up. Wasting time and money on an entire subject would have been adequate punishment enough for a student. The fail on top while you can justify it, was just cruel.",

You admit that this class is a step up from yours and she was getting an A/B in the class. She wasn't lazy, or whatever you think of her. She was likely extremely confused by your emails as she believed she was going to her class. I don't know why she stopped replying, or why it didn't prompt her to ask more questions, but at the end of the day, you *chose* to negatively affect her life when you could have been merciful.\n\nAnd mind you, GPAs can affect your eligibility for scholarships and grants.

You claimed that the different class she had been attending was a different subject altogether, which is one of a few things you've said that suggests she is either crazy or intentionally doing this.\n\nBut towards the end, you said she didn't even qualify for the A or B she had earned (which sounds like effort to me) in the classroom across from yours because she didn't have all the prerequisite classes... including yours. Were you teaching an English class, and the class she ended up taking just happened to be writing intensive enough that it required English first? Did you teach math and she was taking an engineering class? If you were teaching the introduction class for the very class she ended up taking (at the same time, in the nearest class to yours, with a teacher who thought she was in his class and actually *put* her on his roster) then not only is her confusion understandable, I can't help but wonder what else you're exaggerating.\n\nYou said that you emailed the student to either see you in your office, or meet you after class. But you also said that this other teacher manually added her to his roster and was oblivious of the situation up to the very end of the semester. If after receiving your email, she had a very brief conversation with this other teacher after class about how she absolutely has been attending, she would think she satisfied it based on the very same misunderstanding that needed to be addressed. And if you think that the teacher wouldn't have left that part out when you were complaining to him about the students lack of communication, even had he remembered, I'll remind you that he manually added somebody who wasn't and **couldn't** be in his class.\n\nThe part of your story that adds up is the lack of communication you got from the student, but refusing to communicate with them and then giving them an F for a misunderstanding that was at least partially on the teacher across from you was not only petty, it was an abuse of your authority.",

My guess is she already took some painting classes and other art classes in high school and probably had to spend some extra time looking up terms and principles in the courses books she might not be familiar with. With studio classes natural talent and good listening skills will go a long ways in the beginning courses. Beginning painting is usually heavy on studying the maters and replicating styles and learning painting techniques etc.  She obviously still put in the work with her research for papers and studying the materials for test to still get an A or B. If you put in the extra work outside of class you can totally pick up the slack on missing the terms and principles of design and concepts especially if you\u2019re a great listener on lecture days and critiques.",

I forget exactly what being naked in public represents, but then there\u2019s the dream where one\u2019s teeth start to fall out, one by one, albeit painlessly!  That is another common anxiety-driven dream.

One policy I had was I did not accept late homework.\n\n\\#1.  A female young female student stopped showing up.  After a few weeks I called her at home to suggest she drop the class.  A parent answered and said the student was at school.  I said I was the teacher and had not seen her in several weeks.  I found out the next week from another student that the parents had taken her car, did not let her go to her HS Prom, not participate in the graduation and also not let her continue dating her boyfriend.  As it turned out she was going to his apartment and \"taking a nap with him\".\n\n\\#2. One student just stopped showing up so I dropped him.  The next week he shows up with his father.  The father starts to speak and I stopped him saying, \"This is not high school, he can speak for himself.\"  He asked to be readmitted.  I told him I dropped him because he stopped coming.  I would get him back in but would not drop him in the future for any reason.  That would be up to him.  A month or so later I got a note from him in my mailbox that a family member died and he would be at the funeral.  Also enclosed was his homework.  This happened for 3-4 weeks.  I called him at home to suggest he drop the class.  His mother answered and said he was at school that night.  I told her I had not seen him in several weeks. She said she had dropped off at the school.  The next week he sheepishly cam in.  I said I did not like being lied to and refused to accept his homework.  The night of the final exam I asked him to come out of the classroom to talk.  I showed him that the very best he could do in the class was get a \"D\". If he missed just one question he would get an \"F\".  Did he even want to take the exam.  He did and I failed him.\n\n\\#3. Another student left me a note that he had a snake bite.  After several weeks I called to suggest he drop the class.  When his mother said he was at school, I said, \"Oh, the snake bite is better?\"  Her reply was, \"Snake bite, what snake bite?\"\n\n\\#4. A young women in a class came up to me at my desk, bent over wearing a low cut top exposing her breasts and said, \"I need to get an \"A\" in this class.  I'll do anything to get an \"A\".  What can I do to get an \"A\"?\"  I said, \"Get an \"A\" on the mid-term and final, and turn in the programs and get \"A\"s on them and you'll get an \"A\".\"  I don't think that is what she expected from me.\n\n\\#5. One night after everyone had left a young, mid 20s, female student came up to me.  I said, \"You have a question.\"  She said yes and then asked me, \"Do men like oral sex?\"  I replied the title of the class was XXXXXXX and that was not an appropriate question.  I closed up my briefcase and got out of Dodge.\n\nThere were others but those are enough.",

I had to request to record the audio for the same reasons and I would always check beginning of each term they were still on with it.

You assume so much, such as she had to take out large loans under her name, that she didn\u2019t graduate, and that one needs college to have a job (or that a college degree will earn you a higher paying job). Good luck to her suing us as she\u2019s the one that couldn\u2019t find a classroom, pushed herself into the wrong class and also argued with me for over a week via email about my concern about her F and needing to drop, (then later to withdraw) from my class she has yet to show up to was incorrect! She also failed to check this out and confirm her information online! She failed to see her failed grade that was up online basically the entire semester and question it! She then failed to find me, the female instructor and instead talked to the male professor in the wrong class? Likely not cause surely something would have come out when she brought up an email he didn\u2019t send and the things she thinks he said but he would know he didn\u2019t?\n\nHolding students hands and dragging them to the correct class is actually NOT anyone\u2019s job in college except the student. I\u2019m dyslexic and have found my way to the correct classroom since middle school. No excuses for her, but definitely some shame on both the department and especially the registrars office which approved this. Computer system obvious failed her when registering for the wrong class, as did the registrars office who had to officially add her. \nM",

OP teaches class student was SUPPOSED to be in, which is pre-req for the class she was attending, and after finding out student was in wrong class, (as a personal note, the class student WAS attending, she was passing with flying colours, even though she'd not had the pre-req credits,) fails student over procedural mistakes, as opposed to the actual subject matter, forcing student to waste thousands of dollars and months, if not years of time.  \n\n\nFrankly, IMO, OP is trying to make a weird as hell flex, but it just comes off as bad teaching, and really power-trippy.   \n\n\nLike, \"Oh, you should have made more of an effort to come see me. But because I'm a salty lil dickens, I'm going to cost you SO much money and time because I can, and it doesn't matter that you already know the subject matter as evidenced by the fact that my class is required for the class you attended you were getting high grades. So, because I am personally slighted, I am going to derail your entire education.\"  \n\n\nIMO, OP is a shite teacher who might wanna really address their personal failings as a person AND as a teacher. I mean, what kind of shoddy teacher doesn't even try to make physical contact with their student for literal months, especially when they make such a huge deal about knowing who said student is, and just let the system steamroll the student. If I had to interact with this teacher, I'd nope the hell out of their class based on this example alone. Highly disorganized, fails to maintain constructive relationships with students, ignores scholastic and academic achievements out of spite...  \n\n\nQuite honestly, OP sounds like a teacher at a Trump University prior to them all being shut down.",

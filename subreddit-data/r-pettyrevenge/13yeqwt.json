    "postText": "The DD nearest me is a shit hole. Anywhere I go, I always try to order ahead for convenience, and this location makes it anything but convenient. Without fail, for mobile orders, they will prepare the drink and completely ignore the donut order. Doesn't matter whether I'm picking up inside or in the drive thru. \n\nAt the drive thru, it's easier because they can't serve the next person until I leave, so I can just wait there and request the donut I paid for. But when picking up inside, you have to get in the line of people placing orders.\n\nSo when I have to do that, I always tell them I ordered both a donut and a muffin. The $2 muffin is the penalty you pay for denying me the $1 donut I ordered and paid for, wasting my time standing in line behind 5+ orders.\n\nFuck you, Dunkin.",

Krispy Kreme you can always count on at least getting something fresh, I don't see how dunkin even comes close to having a \"superior product\"",

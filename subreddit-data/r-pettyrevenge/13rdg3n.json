    "postText": "For context, I\u2019m a big guy at just under 2m tall or 6\u20195\u201d barefoot, 6\u20196\u201d in shoes\n\nA few months ago my wife and I are having a week holiday in a smallish country town and rural area, we decide to book ourselves in for their progressive dinner hosted by local framers/foodies one night.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, a progressive dinner is where you have starters at one location, main course the next and desert at the final spot. At $85AUD a head it\u2019s a bit pricey but we\u2019d heard good thing about it\n\nThere are 20 guests for the dinner and a mini/shuttle bus is provided so there\u2019s no issues with finding the places and we\u2019re free to drink. We get to the meeting point early as I like to get on mini buses early to get the seats with leg room, remember I\u2019m 6\u20196\u201d as I\u2019m wearing shoes and these buses are cramped at the best of times, worse than cattle class flying\n\nWe get seats at the front with decent legroom for me and I twist to the side to allow others to get on without me tripping them over. FYI there is no-one on the bus with mobility issues, needing a walker a stick etc. I have happily moved for people who needs this seat before for those reasons\n\nOnce everyone is on a sit straight and we head off to our first location, we have some very nice starters and a few drinks, when it is time to leave for the next location I hang back let everyone else on so they done have to deal with me\n\nWhen I board the bus an A-Hole couple (AC from now on) have taken the seats we were in and my wife is sitting directly behind them staring daggers into the back of their heads, to clarify it is the custom or \u201cunwritten rule\u201d that you keep the seat you start with, this is the 3rd or 4th mini bus tour we\u2019d done this holiday and so far everyone had followed this arrangement\n\nNormally when I have to sit in the cramped seats I sit with my legs very spread apart, essentially 1 leg sticking into my wife the other in the aisle, it\u2019s not comfortable but bearable on a 15min drive\n\nThis time I don\u2019t, I sit like a proper catholic school girl knees together and they are fully jammed into the seat in front of me and the (short) guys back who took the only seat with leg room, I know it must have been uncomfortable as he was squirming the whole drive to the main course\n\nI pointed out to my wife what I was doing and she gave mea knowing smile\n\nAt the main course stop AC get straight off not saying a word, after the mediocre offerings for the main course was finished I was chatting away to people around me and my wife excuses herself. 5 min or so later the call goes out to get on the bus so I do my usual and hang back and to get on last, I can be petty but I try not to be vindictive, when I get on the bus there\u2019s my awesome wife sitting grinning like the Cheshire cat in our original spot, she explained that she wanted to reclaim the seats so I could have at least some leg room and stick it to the AC\n\nBest part is she said they gave her the dirtiest looks when they were walking towards the bus and noticed her in our seats, the rest of the evening went fine with a decent desert and drive back with in semi comfort after my wife did the same again for the trip home",

            "comment": "So despite whatever discomfort they may have experienced when they sat in your seat, they were still wiling to endure it again for the next leg of the trip? Wow. But why? It would be understandable if there was an especially tall person in this couple's party.\n\nIf I had to guess, it seems as if this couple may have been resorting to some sort of power play against OP and his wife who resented them taking what they may consider prime seats that THEY deserved or that they wanted to block them from claiming.\n\nWhy people care so much about policing other adults, I'll never understand. A big portion of the conflicts and agitation we experience when dealing with the public would die down if people would mind THEIR business instead of policing everyone else. Glad OP and his wife have figured out how to deal with these fragile, petty people going forward.\n\nEdit: grammatical correction",

The floor under the seat doesn't fit my foot unless I turn my feet sideways. My husband is taller than I am but he is long in the torso. We have the same inseam length. But he cannot fathom why I need to put the seat of my truck back as far as I have it. Why yes, he has in fact witnessed me whacking the hell out of my knees getting into my truck after he drives it. I have also whacked my knees getting into his truck.",

When he realized they were out of reach, he moved the seat forward. This led to me relating the conversation here. I of course got the side eye from him.",

    "postText": "So a few people were asking me to update them on what happened with my loud stomping \"it's cool if I run a commercial kitchen in a 2nd story apartment\" neighbors. \n\nI created a wooden maze/forest of wood that would vibrate into my ceiling &amp; their floor as my Roomba wheeled around the room banging into lumber. \n\nI had to very suddenly take it down. \n\nIt turned into a pretty petty war. \n\nI've updated the original post. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/10v2b7x/revenge_of_the_roomba/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

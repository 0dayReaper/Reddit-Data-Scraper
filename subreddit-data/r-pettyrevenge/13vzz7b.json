    "postText": "Reposted from r\\entitledpeople after someplace suggested it would be enjoyed here.\n\nI apologise for any typos - I'm on the phone and my autocorrect is drunk on power.\n\nSo, a few years ago I was teaching a private urban  religious college.  Since I only had my MS, I was thankful for the opportunity to teach and get the experience before I moved on for my PhD.\n\nThe school usually had me teach accelerated night courses which were aimed on non-traditional learners (read: adults going back to school after many years off).  I loved my students and had a blast teaching them.  I had some issues with a few here and there, bit generally my experiences were really positive.\n\nBut there WAS this one couple.  Let's call them Hanna and Larry.\n\nThat semester I had been asked to cover a more traditional course at the last minute.  Rather than being accelerated, it met three times a week, for an hour, all semester.\n\nFurthermore, the last was very small - only about four students.  Which would have been fine; small classes can be great (and a paycheck was a paycheck!), if it hadn't been for Hanna and Larry.\n\nYou see, this couple had attendance issues to put it mildly.   They would show up to a class or two and then just vanish for a week or more with no word.  Just when I suspected they were gone for good, they'd show up, usually with sole excuse or another (medical issues, car problems, work, etc).\n\nAt first I tried to be sympathetic - I always have the attitude that life happens, and when it rains it pours sometimes.  But at a certain point, I began to grow a bit suspicious they were selling me a story (okay, I was immediately suspicious, but I'm usually inclined to let things slide to a certain point.  Same as MY profs did for me).\n\nThis was all the worse because of the small nature of the class.  Every time I did prep for a session, assuming all four would be present, they'd skip and throw my plans off.  But when I just accepted they would be gone, and prepare activities for two students, they'd show up.\n\nAll of this would be frustrating but acceptable if it weren't for two things.  1) whenever they showed up, these two would have an attitude about them and just expect everyone to conform to their presence and bend to their will and 2) they - of course - weren't doing any of the work.\n\nAnd these two factors came to a head as Hanna (who was the louder and more confident of the two of them) would all but demand extensions, the ability to hand in late work, etc.  I'd give them, only for both her and Larry to blow the work off again. \n\nI like to be pretty accommodating to my students, within reason, but it quickly became obvious thst Hanna thought she was playing me and could grt whatever she wanted.  And THAT couldn't stand.  I have some level of pride and hate being seen as pushover.\n\nNow, I could have crushed them immediately and just said \"no more late work.\"  But I was sure Hanna would just throw a fit and go to administration.  I knew the admin would back me up, but it was a hassle I really didn't want (I was working on a second MS at this point and working two other jobs.  I was frothing-at-the-mouth busy at that point and hadn't even planned on teaching thst semester.  I only agreed because they needed me).\n\nAnd besides, I'm a pretty easy-going guy, but I do have my limits.  I was pissed at this point, but I also have a wicked (to me) sense of humor.  Hanna wants to think she has me wrapped around her finger?  Okay, let her think that.  I was gonna hand her enough rope to hang herself with.\n\nSo, for the past few weeks, whenever she asked for an extension, I'd smile, and say \"sure.\" And then chuckle when nothing came in.  Every time, I wrote her and Larry emails, reminding them of the new date (getting things in writing is key, kids!).\n\nAnd then we arrived at the final - I hadn't seen the twosome in a few sessions and was actually surprised to see them stumble in to take the test.  They failed (of course), but whatcha gonna do.  Hanna comes up to me in front of the class and asks for another extension.\n\nI put my best \"teacher voice\" on and said I was disappointed.  But fine.  Life happens.  However I was posting grades the next weekend, so the absolute last minute I would accept any late was Friday at 11:59 pm.  The second it hit midnight, my books were closed.  I asked if they both understood, and they summoned up a bit of solomness when they assured me that they did.\n\nGood.  I confirmed it in an email, and then sat back to grade the finals over the week (I mean, there were only four.  It wasn't THAT much work!).  I knew there was a risk they'd follow through and I'd end up with a semester's worth of work to grade - but I was feeling pretty confident that that wasn't going to happen at this point.\n\nFriday night rolls around - I didn't work my other jobs that day, and my own school work was done.  So I decided to buy a few beers and kick pack to play some video games and relax!\n\nI look down at a certain point and realize that it's midnight.  I open my email, remind everyone thst the books are now closed (If I give an extension, it's open to the whole class - I'm not playing favorites.  Not that anyone else needed it).  I cracked open another beer, let out my best super-villain laugh and went back to my game.\n\nSunday comes around and I'm posting the final grades for the semester.  I usually hate failing students, but I admit i had a smile on my face as i assigned Hanna and Larry their well-deserved Fs.  \n\nTEN MINUTES after I hit 'save' for the grades I hear the familiar ba-ding of my email going off, followed by another.  Now, who could this be?!  It is, of course, Hanna and Larry.\n\nLarry's email can best be summed up as \"Oh my god, didn't you get my email with the work!?  I sent it on Friday!\"\n\nHanna's said the exact same thing.\n\nNow, it's OBVIOUS they're thinking they can get another day or two to get the work this way.  After all, hadn't I been so pliant and naive all semester? Oh, the fools, the fools, they've played right into my hands and this is the moment I've been waiting weeks for!\n\nI double check to make sure I HADN'T missed emails from them, just to be safe (I hadnt), and then I type my response.\n\n\"No I didn't, and I did just double check after your last message.  That's okay, emails get lost sometime.\"\n\nAt this point I like to image Larry smiling while reading this.  He'd won again!  God this Professor is an idiot!  \n\nI continued \"So, what I'm going to need you to do is go back into the email you sent me with the work.  Just take a screenshot which has the timestamp of the email and forward that to me along with the work.  That'll prove you sent it on time.\"\n\nI then responded to Hanna's email saying the same thing.\n\nWhat was their response?  Did their eyes widen as they realised they'd been held accountable for their actions?  Did panic set in?  Were their tears?  Howls of Regret?  The gnashing of teeth and rending of hair?  \n\nSadly, I'll never know.  I never heard from them again.  They didn't even bother making another try.\n\nAnd me?  Well, I decided to buy some more beer that night to celebrate once again.\n\nOccasionally I'll tell my current students the tale - a humorous reminded that 1) yes, I'm accommodating 2) yes, I'm pretty laid back.  But 3) I'm not an idiot, and don't try to play me.\n\nIt usually gets a good laugh (and if some of those laughs sound a wee bit nervous?  All the better).",

I told my manager that my action plan would say that I missed work because my dying grandma wanted me in the hospital with her, that she was now dead so it would not happen again, but that if another dying family member asked for me that I would be there. They waived the final warning. \n\nWhen it came time to pay for grievance time, which applied to grandparents, they said the obituary didn't count because it didn't have my name. I wrote the obituary, it had my name, but it had \"Andy\" instead of \"Andrew\" so they wouldn't accept it.",

She goes to her advisor. He asks for the death certificate and for the date and place of the funeral. After she produced the death certificate, he gets her extensions again, but afterwards he actually went to the funeral to see it for himself.\n\nLuckily that was the end of it, no more deaths in the family since. But either way, that was a horrible situation for my friends, and her advisor was 100% justified in doubting her. She jokes that on her fourth semester, her advisor checked in with her every single day for the two weeks before finals because he was half convinced that either her, her brother or her mom would die.",

Grandma on other side died around 3 weeks after that, and grandma on the first side died about 10 days after that. All told, 3 grandparents passed in 32 days. When I got the call at work from my folks for the third one, I walked into my boss's office and said, \"I know you are going to say you've heard this one before...\" \n\nThe were all in their 90s and had failing health for some time, so it wasn't a shock or a surprise. Then less than 3 weeks later, my husband's uncle died, too, and then a family cousin on my side the next day. Ended up being 5 family members between November 1 and December 31. It was bonkers.",

TA didn't care, I was welcome to my delay.\n\n6 weeks later I get strep that isn't discovered until it moves into both ear canals. Again, she doesn't want the drs note, stuff happens and freshman are flaky. I ask for a week, she gives me two. \n\nThen I blew my knee out jogging (it partially dislocated and I jogged on it out of the socket until it gave way entirely). That meant Drs appointments, specialty visits, missed classes. Again, she just shrugged and gave me an extension. I was apologetic all the way through, we had several good conversations, I always turned my stuff in by the extension date, and I never asked for a second extension on anything. \n\nThe last time I apologized she told me at least I hadn't killed my grandparents more than once. She apparently never truly believed me, but also didn't really care. Now that I'm a real adult, the idea of shepherding baby college students through their first year sounds exhausting. After several years it's no wonder she didn't care!",

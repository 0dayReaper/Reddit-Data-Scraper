Everytime i go to get a snack or something she likes to make little comments about what i choose, such as \u201creal breakfast of champions huh\u201d or \u201chow are you living off that\u201d i\u2019ve tried the rebuttal of \u201chow are you living off boxed wine\u201d and that definitely helped. She\u2019s continued and i\u2019ve had enough. So, starting today (currently 12:30PM and she\u2019s still asleep.) I will be MAXING my subwoofers and amp out until she leaves or addresses it. Considering she doesn\u2019t live here i\u2019m going to tell her too fuck off if she tells me to turn it down. Let me eat what I like bitch i don\u2019t need you making me more self conscious. IT WAS SALTINES AND PEANUT BUTTER NOT EVEN SERIOUS JUNK FOOD.",

It would make high pitches beeps and buzzes at random intervals.  Despite his best efforts he couldn't find it (I'd play along and help him look when he told me about it) and it drove him CRAZY.  Come move out day I finally pulled it out from its hiding spot and he was a bit pissed to say the least.

It also takes time, effort and energy to train the dog to wear them. You don\u2019t just buy a pair, put them on a dog and expect the dog to accept wearing them. They can and should be custom fitted to the dog using the Velcro straps but even well fitted, they can come off with a well placed paw, use of a wall or other thing the dog can rub against. If they\u2019re too tight to be (eventually) rubbed off or removed by the dog then they are dangerously tight and can injure the dog.\n\nSource: My service dog wears them at concerts and at other loud events. Also, I\u2019m a professional dog trainer with 20+ years of experience.",

I didn\u2019t know until I read the IMDB trivia that was researched, then used specifically to try and make the audience feel sick. \n\nGlad I watched it at home because when it showed in theaters it was even more intense and the reason why audience members ran the hell out of the theater screenings at the start of the movie.",

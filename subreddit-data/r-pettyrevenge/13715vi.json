    "postText": "I(f) was 13 or 14 years old at the time this took place, right at the age where one is horribly embarrassed that their parents even exist and definitely doesn't ever want to be seen in public with them. \n\nIt was a cold, rainy, fall Friday night and my friends and I were planning on going to the $1 movies at our local theater. The theater was about 6 blocks from my house, so we normally walked there on Friday nights. So my friends arrive at my house and we're getting ready to set out walking.\n\nNow, it turns out that my mother and her friends had decided to go see the same movie. Seeing that it was raining, my mother graciously offered to give us a ride, which we quickly declined. She tried insisting, pointing out how silly it was for us to walk in the rain and her friends joined in, calling us dumb teens and calling us out for being embarrassed to be seen with them. They kept on teasing us for awhile, but we stuck to our guns and insisted on walking.\n\nAs we walked my mom and her friends drove by, honking, waving and catcalling out the window in a blatant attempt to embarrass us on front of the teen boys who were also walking along the same stretch of road. A plan began forming in the back of my mind...\n\nSo, we get to the movie theater, wet and bedraggled, get our tickets, and head down to the front rows of the theater. Out of the corner of my eye, I see my mother and her friends way up near the very back row. But I'm determined to pretend like she doesn't exist in front of my friends (and various cute boys who also happened to be there.)\n\nMy mom realizes that I'm purposely ignoring her existence, so she gleefully decides she's going to SHOW ME a thing or two. She stands up on top of her seat and calls out across the theater in a sickeningly sweet, cooing voice, \"Helloooo u/DopeAss_Dawndle!\" While waving both arms above her head to get as much attention as possible.\n\nI turn to look at her, smile sweetly, wave back and without missing a beat yell, \"Hi, Grandma!\" My mom turned bright red and sat her butt right back down in her seat. We have laughed over this story many times in the years since, but my mom says she learned that day not to poke the bear, lol.",

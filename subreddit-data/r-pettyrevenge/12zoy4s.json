    "postText": "I love this sub, and it brought to mind a coworker who we\u2019ll just call Bill. \n\nIn the late 70\u2019s as a student I took a job at a very upscale hotel in a resort town. I worked the desk. Bill was an older guy who was in the military and worked part time on the weekends.\nBill was a friendly type, easy going on the surface but if you ever pissed him off\u2026\nWe had this older couple staying there who were absolutely the worst people. They complained about everything. One day they came to the desk demanding we pay to have their rental car washed because of the seagulls crapping. Every shift it seemed they either had a complaint or a demand. They didn\u2019t tip, either. \nWhen they checked out they asked for a bellman and since both were busy Bill volunteered. They had a lot of heavy luggage but didn\u2019t tip Bill. \nWhen they left the woman left a pile of postcards to be mailed. Bill and I, being bored decided to read them. Then\u2026\n\nBill took a couple of the cards and went to the back. When he returned he showed me his handiwork.\n\nHe meticulously edited the cards by writing in on one \u201cf***ing\u201d to make it look like \u201cyour uncle X and I are having a f***ing good time\u201d and on the other to what appeared to be a postcard to some Reverend she wrote that \u201cX\u201d spent time at a local church. Well, he added \u201clooking at boys\u201d. You could not tell that someone had messed with the cards. He had copied her style perfectly.\nI wonder sometimes if she had  been asked about these cards. After 45 years, still makes me smile a little",

    "postText": "I had a bully in middle school who used to torment the life out of me by beating me up, pouring water on me, locking me in bathrooms, making fun of my weight etc. \n\nI recently saw on Facebook that he\u2019s engaged so I stupidly thought of a petty revenge plan. \n\nI used an old Instagram account and posed as a pretty woman and dm\u2019d him. 20 min later he messaged me back. We chatted where I pretended to be a woman and he Began to flirt. \n\nI screenshotted all his sexts in case he might unsend them (including the NSFW pics that he sent) \n\nI forwarded those screenshots to his fianc\u00e9 and badaboom, the engagement photos from their Facebook were deleted the next day. \n\nWas this too much?",

Mainly because there aren't any sources from when the phrase first emerged that back that theory up (although there still COULD be a link, all history is to an extent guesswork!)\n\nThe most likely origin of the phrase is actually linked to the slaughter of animals - so perhaps still not nice from an animal welfare perspective, but not as dark as suicide. Long story short, in 16th century England the word bucket meant a beam from which you hang items. That could be any item, but it included animals which butchers would hang from the beam before slaughter. When an animal was slaughtered they would obviously squirm and kick about - and so before death, they would often literally kick the bucket. As in they kicked the beam they were hanging from.\n\nShakespeare used the term bucket to refer to beams in butchers shops, as well as many other less famous 16th century writers, so this origin is considered to have way more evidence than the suicide idea!\n\nSorry for the long tangent. I just find etymology neat is all.",

Prior to mechanization, when milking was done by hand, farmers would often slaughter a dairy animal if it didn't take to milking. One of those bad habits being continually kicking over the bucket containing the milk. I could definitely see someone asking a farmer why they slaughtered ol' Betsy and them responding \"she kicked the bucket\". \n\nLinguistics is really interesting when it comes to the history behind the way we talk, and the events that shaped it. Bill Bryson writes some great books on this very topic. The Mother Tongue is about the history of the English language and its totally worth the read, even if linguistics isn't typically up your alley.",

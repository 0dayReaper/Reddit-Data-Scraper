    "postText": "I\u2019m a few years old than my brother and we took the bus together in elementary school.\nOne day I looked up and noticed some of the \u201ccool\u201d girls in the back of the bus throwing spit balls at my brother\u2019s head for literally no reason. The next day I got on the bus with a regular bag of m&amp;ms and sat in the back. They sat down in the front. As soon as the bus started rolling I began throwing m&amp;ms at them 5-6 at a time. Beaning them with hard candy. When they would turned around to see who was throwing them I stared out the window like the quiet little mouse I was. I emptied the bag on them. I remember feeling very satisfied. I\u2019m still happy about it.",

My friend leaped up and started pounding on the bully with her umbrella, kicking him and she also punched him full in the face. The driver pulled over and got her off of the bully, but not before she reduced the bully to tears.\n\nShe did not get in trouble because the bully had started the whole mess. And no one messed with the stepbrother after that.",

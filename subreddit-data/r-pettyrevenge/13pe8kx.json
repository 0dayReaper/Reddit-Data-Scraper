    "postText": "About 60 years ago I was 5 and my older brother was eleven. I was his punching bag, fart pillow, you name it! It didn't take long before I was fed up with it and wanted revenge since my parents never believed me when I'd tattle.\n\nOne day I wasn't feeling good and it was a hot evening. My brother was at his desk doing homework with no shirt on and I was running around in my undies. And I felt a fart coming on! At last, my chance! I snuck over slightly behind him off to his side and dropped my undies. When the right moment came, I yelled \"Hey Brother!\" He spun to look at me.\n\nAnd I let loose pushing it all out!\n\nThat was the moment I learned what diarrhea was... and he was wearing it all.. from waistline to hairline, on his homework, and everywhere else. \n\nI was in bed shortly after with a very sore butt after my dad walked in after all the screaming. And I paid grandly when my brother got me alone the next day!. But... it... was... worth... it!\n\nMoral of the story: Don't fart on your brother... when you got the runs!",

He had to go to the bathroom but we were almost home so had to wait. I kept yelling at him to stop the whole way home, literally gagging and tears in my eyes as if someone was cutting onions. Even with the window down sticking my head out in the middle of winter it did no good. \n\nWe were literally 3 blocks away from the house when he let rip the worst one yet. I threw up. All over the outside of the car. Which made my dad gag as we were pulling into the driveway (he doesn\u2019t handle puke very well). We were a TRAIN WRECK that night. Dad ran inside, brothers are laughing as they\u2019re running inside to the restroom, mom is just annoyed but trying to hide her enjoyment seeing everyone else suffer LOL",

Dad left for work early so my sister must have woken up and crawled into moms bed to snuggle. I came in and told my mom I didn\u2019t feel good. She was tired so she just told me to climb into bed with them for a little while. I did what I was told and was okay for a little while. Then, just when I\u2019m dozing off, my eyes snap open and I projectile vomit all over the bed, all over my sister, all over my mom.\n\nMom is screaming and jumping all over the place, trying to rip the sheets off before it all soaks through, sister is crying, I\u2019m STILL puking everywhere. Fast forward a few minutes and my sister and I are both in the tub with water just streaming on us, my mom is still cursing me out, and keeps demanding why I never said I didn\u2019t feel good \ud83e\udee0\n\nWhen my sister annoys me I still remind her of the time I covered her head to toe in puke \ud83d\ude02",

Daily, we had story time where we'd all go sit at this big round table, put on headphones, and listen to a story. \n\nOnce the crush was established, I'd make a daily B-line to the table so I could get the seat beside him.  I'd look at him,  smile at him, and do what  2nd grade girls do. \n\nOne day, while sitting at the table next to him, I started to feel really bad.  It seemed the longer I kept the headphones on with \" The Story of Ping,\"  blaring away in my ears, the more nauseous I was becoming. \n\nTrying to not display how I was really feeling, I once again turned to look at him and smiled.   About that time, it was like an erupting volcano, I was smiling and spewing my hot, wet, vomit all over my Prince Charming.\n\nMy very unattractive and gross projectile display of my 2nd grade affection didn't go unnoticed by everyone present for long.  It quickly picked up speed, and morphed into the emesis of the round table, the 2nd grade upchuckers barfing group from hell. \n\nI was crying, sick, and horrified at the time, knowing that my love would never ever look at me the same way again.",

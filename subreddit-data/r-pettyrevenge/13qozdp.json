    "postText": "So someone said I should make this its own post so here..\n\nBack in the mid to late 90's early 2000, my brother would always pick on me make fun of me in school shit like that.... Well my brother, sister, and me are all a year and half apart. My brother is the oldest, sister youngest and me middle child (I know love the middle child). Well I would always get his hand me down clothes so they were always worn out I barely got new clothes that were just mine.. any way he would make fun of my clothes in high school around all his little buddies, he was pretty popular well they would all laugh and laugh and it piss me off but in ninth grade I was a skinny little kid, like barley 5 ft and maybe 95 lbs soaking wet. The last thing he did he picked up a trash can and put it over my whole body and sat on it... (Yeah looking back it was pretty funny and I probably would have done the same thing) but at the time I was pissed. \n\nWell he was throwing a pool party at our house because his birthday is in the summer so he wanted to do a party for his friends from school. (About 35 kids or so, most of them were girls) Well he always went \"commando\" (never wore underwear) so I went into his room and cut a slit down the crotch of the shorts he was gonna wear.. well he was a \"class clown\" as you say always wanted to make people laugh at stupid shit. Well every one was out side on the patio and my brother came out top of the back porch over looking the pool and people. He got everyone's attention, and went \n\"HEYYYY YOU GUYSSSS!!!!\"(Goonies reference)  and grabbed his shorts and pulled them up to his chest and low and behold....... His \"very little and very surprised friend\" decided to pop on out and say \"HELLO!!!!\"\n\nTook him far to long to realize the people weren't laughing at his joke......\n\nWasn't hear from for the rest of the night....",

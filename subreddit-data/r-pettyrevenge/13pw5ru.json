One of the items was a White Bucket Hat. As a joke he gave it to me to put on and made fun of me on how ugly it looked on me. He took it step further by asking others to ask me to display it for them. They also laughed and said how ugly it looked on me. \n\nI decided to have my revenge by wearing it golfing with him. His jaw dropped when he say me and asked me if I had another hat as he clearly mortified. I ended up wearing it through all 18 holes but I did take it off when we went to a restaurant after.",

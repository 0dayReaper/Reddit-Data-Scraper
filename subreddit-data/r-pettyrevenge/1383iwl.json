    "postText": "I cannot believe I accidentally deleted my previous post. I was trying to remove a comment and apparently I'm not very savvy with Reddit on my mobile. \n\nTo start again...My older brother is a sociopath who used to hold me down when I had a loose tooth and rip it out with a pliers. My parents always considered me sensitive for some reason. \n\nFast forward 20 years. My wife and SIL used to work at the same facility, but SIL got fired. SIL still has moles planted to keep her current on the gossip that occurs. I happen to also work at the same facility and got wind of some terrible rumors that were going around about my wife. Of course spread by SIL because she's the type of person to stir the pot and encourage my brother's hairpin temper. After 20 years of this I finally got tired and sent a group text to brother and SIL basically calling them out for spreading rumors and that it's time to let go of a place you were fired from years ago. Everyone in life was always afraid of confrontation with him, so he got used to not having any repercussions for his actions. \n\nBrother is first to answer back and basically says the worst things a human could say. My wife suffered from severe postpartum depression and he used that to call her a \"Shitty mother.\" She has extreme mom guilt over this and it hit her hard. Then he uses the fact that several years prior I struggled with addiction (I've been clean for 3 years now) to tell me to overdose and how I'm a shitty father who is basically human garbage. After some more rambling he sends a text calling my wife a cunt among other things. Eventually communication stops and his number is blocked again. (I had he and her blocked before, but unblocked them to send the message.) \n\nA few weeks pass and I find out from a co-worker that my brother is trying to get elected to a local hockey board. Now, for context I live in MN where hockey is God. Seriously, being on the hockey board is like being in the fucking illuminati. They're typically pompous, wealthy assholes who think they deserve special treatment because they have a conference room. If this happens my brother will relish the new fa\u00e7ade he is putting on. \n\nSo, I screenshot the text messages he sent and email them to hockey board chairman. I urge the chairman to reconsider allowing someone who openly calls women cunts to be around children as well as having input into the goings on of the community hockey arena. Chairman turns out to be super cool and assures me that my brother is not only out of the running, but the messages have all been forwarded to the rest of the board members. \n\nBrother is now ostracized from the hockey community, and everyone knows the real him. He was very good at acting like a saint around other people. But, the real him was finally exposed and the one thing his narcissistic ass wanted more than anything in the world was gone. I shiver to imagine what would have happened had he made the board. \n\nSo again to my brother, fuck you.",

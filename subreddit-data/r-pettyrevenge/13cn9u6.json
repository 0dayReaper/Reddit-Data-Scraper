    "postText": "This is pretty tame compared to others here, but I couldn\u2019t do much more at the time, and this still gets comments from his friends. \n\nMy ex husband was a POS. 10 year relationship, 4 months of marriage all down the drain in 1 morning when he tried to throw me off our balcony &amp; then attacked me when he realised he was too weak to pick me up. \n\nI had him arrested &amp; he went to prison but only for a week. When he got out, he told his solicitor what certain things he definitely wanted that I couldn\u2019t keep; his tv and his PlayStation. \n\nI was pissed. The PlayStation was bought with vouchers and money that our friends and family had given us for our wedding and he decided to spend one day whilst I was at work. As were a lot of the games. But fine. He wanted them back he could have them back. I was keeping his beloved gaming PC and our cat so I felt I was wining in some sense. \n\nHowever, he really should have been more specific. See, when he said he wanted the TV and the PlayStation back, that\u2019s what he got. That\u2019s *all* he got. I kept everything else. \nThe power cables. \nThe remotes. \nThe controllers. \nThe games. \n\nAnd, as I had a restraining order against him and his family, he had no way of contacting me. At least, not until I filed for divorce a few months later, where my solicitor discovered he wanted them back as part of the settlement. Unfortunately for him, she agreed that I gave him exactly what he asked for so no, he doesn\u2019t get them back. \n\nMoral of the story? Be specific.",

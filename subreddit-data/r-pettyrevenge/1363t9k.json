    "postText": "Whilst at university, in the days when mobile phones were new and we still used the one payphone in our hall of residence on the ground floor, I was on a six week placement. If you failed it you weren't allowed to progress to the next year so it was really important. \n\nThe guy in the room next to me kept playing his music at all hours and walking off to chat to his mates leaving it playing. Myself and another friend also on placement on our floor politely asked him to be reasonable and keep the noise down at night as we needed to sleep and be professional the next day on placement. He couldn't care less and we were getting really stressed about it.\n\nI was chatting about it to a friend who worked as a security guard at the university halls of residence and he asked if I wanted to complain about it officially or \"off the books\". I didn't want to cause my neighbour any official grief even though he was being an arse. Plus I didn't want a confrontation or any come back whilst on placement. My friend said \"leave it with me and I'll fix it\"\n\nWhen my friend was on his next shift he checked that my neighbour had settled in well after midnight and was all quiet and so began his plan. He took the payphone off the hook and left it hanging. He then walked up to our third floor and knocked on his door. My neighbour answered and was told by security that the phone had gone and it was a friend of his asking to speak to him but they didn't leave a name. He didn't have much money and what money he did have was running out. My neighbour ran downstairs and picked up the hanging phone. Just the pips. His friend had obviously run out of money. He walked back up and went to bed. My mate returned an hour later, knocked on his door waking him and told him his mate was back on the phone. He ran downstairs and was too late, his 'friend' had run out of money again. He walked back upstairs and settled in. An hour later same thing only this time he realised what was going on and why. He apologized to my security friend and promised to keep his loud music to a decent level and time. \n\nThe following day the neighbour, to his credit, apologized and never kept us awake all night again",

The electrical outlet passed thru to his loud neighbor. He wired a simple switch into his neighbor's socket. At 10 p.m. he'd turn off the socket and the music. His neighbor never caught on.",

                    "comment": "Six person suite in college, five ordinary guys with demanding majors and one inconsiderate jerk majoring in partying with a minor in psychology. (Why psychology? Because he has father issues and has guilt-tripped his dad into paying for this expensive school despite the fact that he is already on academic probation and probably failing all his classes.)\n\nIt's after midnight near the beginning of exam week and everyone is asleep... everyone except 'Jerk' who arrives with an entourage of freshman females and begins blasting the stereo (my stereo!) loudly in the living room while cooking hash in the toaster oven. This wakes everyone up and, one by one, we stagger out into of our rooms to ask him to turn it down because we have exams the next morning. He refuses. It's just natural to party all night on exam week and if we don't like it that's our problem. After presenting a united front, he's finally persuaded to take his party and his hash somewhere else but he lets us know he's doing us a big favor and next time he won't be so accommodating.\n\nNext time is undoubtedly tomorrow night. Assembling the next afternoon, we hit on a strategy. The toaster oven is stored under the its owner's bed. The stereo is disabled in a  non-obvious way: by removing the U-shaped jumpers between the preamp and power amp sections. It it still has all the cables plugged in, it lights up, the meters move, but no sound comes out. There's some minor commotion in the middle of the night but everyone rolls over and goes back to sleep. When 'Jerk' shows up the following afternoon to get some clean clothing (Where does he sleep?) nobody knows anything. The toaster oven is still gone (\"I think Jon has it in his room. It's his after all.\") and the stereo is playing something soothing while a couple roomates study at the living room table. Somehow, though, that stereo never works properly after midnight (\"Are you sure you weren't just too stoned to figure it out?\"). Exam week finishes uneventfully. When the next semester starts, we have a new roommate. Apparently 'Jerk' didn't satisfy the terms of his academic probation.",

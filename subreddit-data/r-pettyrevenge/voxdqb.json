    "postText": "I was travelling from Edinburgh to London by train and had a booked window seat with a table.\n\nI got on the train to find 4 guys sitting at the table, the one in my seat that was clearly marked as booked, refused to move as he was with his friends and the train was packed. The ticket collecter passed and I asked him to help.\n\nHe asked the guy to move but he refused and somehow that was that.\n\n\"So what now?\" I asked\n\n\"You can find another seat but I have no power to move him, only the police and move him and they will not turn up just to move someone out of a seat.\"\n\nThere were no seats free in the carriage and probably not many free on the train so standing to London was a possibility.\n\n\"I'm going to take a seat in first class\" - better surroundings, power sockets and free tea and coffee.\n\n\"You can't sit there, you don't have a booking\"\n\n\"Well, you could call the police to move me but apparently they won't turn out to move someone out of a seat\"\n\nI had a lovely trip with power for my laptop and a wide comfy seat.",

Too long delay, your car with the seat not in the train, or WiFi not working are all reasons to receive compensation and the conductor can give it. Last time I had two of those problems, the train had different cars and no place for my resevration. The conductor promptly allowed me to sit in 1st class and printed two coupons for next ticket purchase.",

If you don't move or leave when asked, the only people that can force you to comply are the police because individual citizens do not have the right to apply physical force to one another.\n\nEdit: this comment lacks clarity. What I was trying to put across is that rail workers aren't legally empowered to use physical force.\n\nReasonable force is a right that all citizens have, including rail workers, but rail workers don't have any *more* right to use physical force than that provision. Therefore, if physical force is required to enforce rail regulations, rail workers will call for police assistance.\n\nI hope this clears things up.",

The conductor held the train at the next stop and a scuffle broke out, right next to me as I was sat by the doors. \n\nThis hero from nowhere swept his knees back and pushed him on the platform. The idiot didn't fall but was furious. As the train moved off he was kicking and wellying the carriages. \n\nNo one applauded, but myself and Mr Miagi asked the conductor if he was OK. To be fair he was a few inches over 6ft but the kid flailed a LOT\n\nWe both gave our contact info to the conductor and we all met in court about 6 weeks later. The kid never showed up, multiple offences sentencing next hearing (not required to go)\n\nThe week after I got 2 open first class tickets valid for 2 years. Hubby and I went to London for a long weekend.\n\nNow we use Seatfrog since we discovered how nice it is lol",

You cannot sit in a seat that is marked as reserved if you havent reserved it, unless you have permission.\n\nThat means its a criminal offence under the Transport Act 2000 to refuse to move.\n\nThe conductor is not law enforcement however as an agent of the train operator he can refuse service (i.e. stop the train and ask the person to move or leave).\n\nIf the person refuses to move his next resort is the transport police or normal police in a pinch. They are now responsible for enforcing the law.\n\nThey are then able to issue a spot fine. If the person continues to refuse to move other offences can arise as they might in any other police encounter. Force can and will be used if it gets to this point.\n\nThe conductor plain and simple couldn't be arsed. He probably wanted to get home on time. All there is to it.",

Your ID had \u2018graduate student\u2019 printed on it BUT if you showed up at campus police and showed them a copy of the course catalog with your name listed as instructor, they\u2019d just give you a faculty parking pass. 100% free. Not many students knew about it, so some of us got prime parking spots and others (usually the dickheads who treate dother grad students like crap and were thus not told about the loophole) had to pay 500$.",

In one of the stories he's arguing with a man about something and the man slaps Nasrettin Hoca in a fit of rage. So he take the man to court and when they get in front of the judge the judge says the man must pay Nasrettin Hoca one gold coin (a small amount of money). Nasrettin Hoca argues with the judge that the punishment should be harsher. The judge tells him \"it is what it is\", so Nasrettin Hoca slaps the judge and tells him that he can collect his gold coin directly from the defendant.",

The train employees sat outside and smoked. Nobody batted an eye. After two hours, they got back in the train, and we went on our way to Florence. This was in 2005.",

Now, I'm a silly person who always carries a tape measure on them. Measured it out, it was something like a 7x9, I don't remember exactly, but I do remember it was oddly sided. Why? Because when brought to her attention, she offered me the 9x7 instead and asked if the different lay out would work.\n\nNo lady, I am paying for cubic feet here. I don't care about how it's laid out, I care about how much I can fit in the area. Turning my couch the other way won't make 300 cubic feet suddenly appear. She refunded me the price but refused to refund the activation fee.\n\nWent the to the website, sent them a message calling it a bait and switch, got the full refund in a few hours.",

            "comment": "I had gotten an assigned seat motor coach ticket out of Incheon Airport. The coaches typically have a row of single seats on the right and pairs of seats on the left but it's kinda luck of the draw what ticket you get. I mean you can request one or the other, but if they don't have, they don't have.\n\nSo, I had gotten a single seat which was great because I was traveling alone and didn't want to sit for hours next to a stranger as I had just done on the flight. Some dude comes walking up the aisle. He's taking people's tickets and looking at them then giving them back. He gets to me, takes my ticket and *obviously* swaps the ticket and at that moment I realized that he was trying to scam me out of my single seat ticket.\n\nI waited for the actual ticket checker to come by. The scammer was following behind but hadn't said anything yet. The official checker took my ticket and saw that it was the wrong seat. Before the checker could say anything, the scammer started complaining that I was in his seat and produced the ticket he swapped from me. He really went for it. I looked the scammer in the eye and said in Korean, \"that man is a liar and a thief.\" Scammer went silent, checker looked at him and waited for his story. He didn't have one. Checker swapped our ticket stubs back and scammer went back to sit down.\n\nAs soon as we're on our way, scammer sees that there is a single seat open and tries to take it. Under normal circumstances nobody would care. Under these circumstances, though, driver stopped the bus and guided him back to his assigned seat.",

We get on the train and a bunch of teens are parked in our seats and told me to F off so I told them move now or else, they decided to see what or else was so mum told Bobby to get up on the seats and he was standing on thier soft parts so crys of\" my balls ow your dogs crushing my balls\" were heard up and down the carriage along with mum and several passengers laughing while I said \" you asked what or else was, get out of our seats now\". Bobby just thought they were messing about and licked all thier faces before we got him down so they could leave. They tried complaining to the conductor who told them in front of us to shut up or he would throw them off the train. I should point out the seats were the ones with a table so Bobby had somewhere to lie down. The conductor kept checking on us and made a fuss of Bobby. Other stuff happened but nothing as funny as that. By the time we reached Edinburgh Bobby had a few fans and mum and I had a fun journey to tell my dad and big brother about.",

You can find tons of videos of people acting like idiots on planes and just getting the sweetest of justice. They don't hesitate to call the cops and have you dragged off the plane if you are an asshole before takeoff. If you're really a moron and get in trouble once the plane is in the air, I hope you like fucking duct tape. \n\nGlad it worked out for you, sucks that the ticketman was such a pussy about it though.",

And no one on the station or train services noticed either. I sat down at my booked seat, and an Asian family got on with the same ticket, and said I was in their spot; and I refused to move. They sat on the table opposite, and presumably the ticket collector should have checked the seating but said nothing; and occasionally they looked at me, and I tried to defuse the situation by smiling... It was only after I got home and slept, and rechecked the ticket that I realised they'd been in the right, they'd booked that seat at that time. And that my smiling might have seemed like gloating, which is why they kept glancing at me. \n\nThere's no chance they'll ever read this, but all the same I'm genuinely sorry and it wasn't intentional. Stealing seats is petty and childish and wasn't something I meant to do.",

    "postText": "TLDR at the end. \nThis happened when I had only just moved from home and got my own place. Super proud of myself as I\u2019d saved like a demon and bought (with mortgage, obviously) my first place. Lovely little 2 bed flat in a slightly rough area but I loved it and it was all mine! \n\nMy mum and step-dad came to visit for a few days a few months after I was settled in, nicely decorated in my style, all my own furniture. One of the evenings they stayed I had to work a late shift. They planned to go out for dinner and to the pub and I left them to it. Came home at 11pm and my mum had moved nearly all of the furniture around and all my books and kitchen stuff were moved to different shelves or cupboards. She even moved my bed in my room so when I opened the bedroom door it hit the bed. I was pissed. \nSo I angrily fixed what I could that night before going to bed. Spoke to her about it the next day, explained its my home and I had it how I liked it so stop please. I put everything else back which took hours, she grumbled the whole time that it looked better her way. \nTheir last day I nipped out to the shops to get us some nice bits for lunch and in the hour I was gone she\u2019d done it again. Moved all my kitchen stuff around to where she liked it. \nAgain I told her off, my house, my rules. She still maintained it was better her way and I should just let her crack on. Fine, I let her do what she wanted and put stuff back when they left. \n\nMy revenge, I went to visit their house 6 months later and did it to her. \n\nShe went out to work one day and I rearranged every bit of furniture I could by myself. Everything. Swapped the dining room and living room furniture over so you had to walk food through the living room and across the hallway to get to the dining room. Swapped their bedroom and guest room curtains over (the windows were different sizes so their now bedroom curtains were 2 foot too short). Even the pointless little things like moving the spoons to a different side of the drawer and moved every photo on the walls to a different wall. Rearranged the fridge. Took me 7 hours. \nMy step dad was home while I did it and laughed his head off the whole time. He refused to help but understood so let me crack on.\n\nNeither me nor my step dad said anything when she got home, we just sat watching tv (which was now in what was their dining room) and I asked her how was work. \nShe didn\u2019t say a word. She walked round the house, taking it all in, for 20 minutes. Then came and sat down, looked at me and said \u201cpoint taken\u201d. \nThey\u2019d put it back to how it was the next time I visited. \n\nWe\u2019ve not spoken of it since. \n\nTLDR: my mum moved my furniture in my new house so I rearranged her whole house in return.",

My wife got home from work before I did, and one night, when I walked in, I could tell something was wrong by my wife's tight lips and deliberate movements. Oh, and the glaring eyes.\n\nMy mom had rearranged the kitchen drawers, but there was a bunch of stuff she didn't know where to put. In our kitchen, we had one drawer that was the \"junk drawer\". You probably have one in your house.\n\nDeck of cards? Junk drawer. Bamboo skewers? Junk drawer. $5 bill for a pizza delivery tip? Junk drawer.\n\nApparently, mom didn't know where all the stuff from the junk drawer was supposed to go, so it was sitting in a pile on the kitchen table. She said, \"Oh, I cleaned up but I didn't know where this stuff goes.\"\n\nI opened up the junk drawer and took out whatever she had put in there (tea towels, I think) and then took the drawer over to the table, held it below the surface  of the table and then swept everything into the drawer with my forearm. Then I shook the drawer to get everything to settle and put the drawer back into the cabinet.\n\n\"Thanks, mom ... all of that stuff goes in that drawer right there, where you found it.\"",

I had my kitchen set up so I had all my spices and seasonings within about 2 steps of the stove.  \n\nMom insisted on moving things around in my kitchen.  Every cabinet was swapped, my shelving was moved into another room, think the only thing not moved was my coffee pot and knife rack.  I didn't like it, had to walk to the end of the kitchen for things that had been a step away...  \n\nI called my sister and paid her a few bucks to do the same at my parent's house.  Plates were the pots had been, Tupperware where the plates were, spices where the cookie sheets were...  EVERYTHING had a new spot.\n\nMom called me and flipped out when they got home, I just said I had to move everything around here too now.  Thought she liked changing kitchens around so much it was time for some changes there after 20 years.",

Keeping the AC off would mean a lesser differential of heat, so less heat total needs to be moved out. Well that's what I understand from taking a couple of years of Physics including thermal physics unless I'm missing a very important mechanism that increases efficiency",

She swapped the open shelves for the cabinets and moved my dishes to a different cabinet, swapped the condiments with the door stuff, and even moved my appliances around in the kitchen.

Keep their daily wear clothes in a cubby in the family room - the place where you dress them - instead of spending time putting clothes in a dresser upstairs where they're inconvenient.\n\nNeed to see things to remember them?   Hey glass or open cupboards, put the important things where you'll see them, and things you'll be prompted to think of when you need them can use the out-of-sight spaces like the bins in the refrigerator.

            "comment": "I went away for a week and my MIL painted MY kitchen while I was gone. Walls, cupboards everything. I came home late from the flight and found paint on my coffee maker, on my tv, stove etc. years later I\u2019m still finding speckles of paint on the floor. I was so pissed. Boundaries way crossed. \nShe was pissed I didn\u2019t appreciate it \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \nAbout 6 months later she was going on vacation. She called and asked about something and I told her to have fun on vacation and for her to be excited about the surprise I had planned for her. (She had just gotten her kitchen remodeled) MIL got very quiet and said I\u2019m not to touch her house. All I did was laugh and say something along the lines of if you can, I can. Now I had no intentions of doing anything because I wanted to stay married. I knew just saying those things MIL would be panicking the whole trip!",

So she organized our storage. Incredible, above and beyond. Reorganized our closets. Ok, awesome, my husband\u2019s was a mess. Reorganized the kitchen. Ok, that\u2019s fine, didn\u2019t do too much damage, I appreciate someone cleaning out the pantry. Then she started redoing the dining room - moving furniture and adding \u201cdecorative accents.\u201d Thankfully, my husband was discharged before she moved on to other parts of the house. I\u2019m still super grateful for her help, but I still have to call her occasionally to ask where she hid stuff.",

Had an infuriating habit of taking the whole roll of loo roll with him when he left the bathroom. Sod knows why. Being a woman I need toilet roll every time I pee, he obviously didn\u2019t so didn\u2019t see the issue. After the umpteenth time I had to yell him to bring me it in the bathroom I\u2019d had enough. \nI went out and bought 4 packs of 12 toilet rolls and unpacked them all in the bathroom. Covered every surface of the quite small room with new rolls. Filled the bath with the leftovers. He laughed and put them in the cupboard and now remembers not to wander off with the whole roll.",

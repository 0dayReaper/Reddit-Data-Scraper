    "postText": "My husband passed away 2 years ago.  He was a remodeler who had a broad list of clients. For a time, to help out the adult daughter, let's call her \"Kiki\", of my good friend of 42 years, \"Ami\".  He would hire her as a helper on some of his larger remodeling projects. During that time, K would occasionally borrow things for her own projects- a portable cd player, a pair of channel locks, a winch &amp; come-along, a table saw, chain saw, a Graco cart paint sprayer, and an air compressor and nail gun.  They were all borrowed clean, in working order, in good condition with all relevant parts included. Every single one of them was returned with great delays, all broken and missing significant parts and a crap ton of excuses. Over two years, Kiki managed to cost him nearly $5K in losses. Finally, he also quit hiring her as a helper because he caught her stealing from one of his clients and forced her to put the item she took right back and then kicked her off the job immediately.\n\nLast September, I was visiting Ami and Kiki was there. And then Kiki hit me up for what she called her 'promised' inheritance which was the first I ever heard about it.  Given that my hubby and I spent the 8 years of his terminal illness talking about what he wanted after his death, given that he gifted things of his that he wanted friends to have BEFORE he died, I knew damn well he didn't intend for Kiki to have anything.  My husband left no will.  Ami knew that my hubby had quit lending her tools after getting the cart paint sprayer back (it was a $1200 purchase and was less than 4 months old when it was borrowed and returned broken in ways the warranty would not cover.) Ami also knew Kiki's attempted theft had caused him to refuse to have her work on anything with him for any reason. (Ami was also a victim of her daughter stealing from her as well.)\n\nNow, our state is a community property state. When a spouse dies without a will, only the surviving spouse inherits, so Ami told her daughter to back off and I got the bright idea of how I was going to handle getting rid of all that broken stuff which was still taking up room in the tool shed, so I told her, I'd be sure to pick something out for her even though her own behavior was the root cause of the bad blood between herself and my husband.\n\nSo, the next day, with Ami's help, I dropped off ALL the broken tools and the busted-up CD player Kiki borrowed from my hubby at her apartment. Kiki wanted to know what I expected her to do with all of it. I told her that I expected her to do with them whatever it was she had expected my hubby to do with them after she returned them in the condition they were in.  Now, she is the proud owner of a bunch of useless tools and I got to reclaim nearly 35 sq. ft. of space in what is now MY tool shed!",

Makes sense, because she\u2019s also a thief who feels entitled to help herself to things that don\u2019t belong to her.",

Took every penny.\n\nHer grandparents have enough to scrape by but became much more dependent on my GF's parents. Needless to say there was some bad blood because their son stole all the family money and cut them off.\n\nWell he dies of a suspected OD and who gets left with the cleanup? All the money is gone but they still want their (thieving) son to have a funeral etc. So they pay for it, take care of everything even though they can't recover any money (meaning they're spending the little they have on him after he  took everything)\n\nAnyways after all that his kids show up, now they're adults but didn't do anything to deal with their dads final expenses or the logistics etc. Put everything on the grandparents. First thing they do is ask for money. Then they get all mad that there isnt any like \"we know he stole all that money from great grandparents where is it?\"\n\nBad people are really *really* bad. Disgusting behavior from a whole branch of the family.",

They almost certainly won't win, but if I'm dying I wouldn't want my spouse to have to relive that trauma in a drawn out legal battle.",

I get it if you all are related in some way, but for this girl to expect someone in no way blood related to her (no matter how close you all are) to give her an inheritance seemed entitled on her part.\n\nI commend her mother for helping you teach her a lesson though.",

Kiki has always had a streak of self-interest so I reckon she thought because I was NOT taking up his business (work for which I had neither the knack, skill, or inclination) that she'd get a buttload of his tools for nothing.  As my friend goes, she knows her daughter's character, doesn't approve of it, it wasn't the way she was raised to be and hasn't put up with Kiki's BS since she was 35.",

    "postText": "On mobile, forgive my textwall.  This happened to me last night.  I got in my car to pick up my girlfriend and my tire pressure light came on.  I have a 12v air compressor in my backseat but it\u2019s loud and fills sort of slowly, so I opted to drive to the local wawa.  (For those who don\u2019t have Wawa, it\u2019s like if 7/11 got sober and went to college.)  Wawa\u2019s air pumps are free to use which usually means there are at least a few cars lined up, but when I pulled in there was only one other car.  Score.  I pulled behind the guy filling his tires and an older gentleman in a BMW pulled in behind me.  After about 3 minutes a woman in a brand new Lexus pulls up directly next to me and puts her window down.  \u201cI only have to fill one tire, do you mind if I go in front of you?\u201d, she asked.  I said, \u201cActually I do, we\u2019ve been waiting here for a little bit, sorry.\u201d  She muttered something while rolling her window up and I put up mine.  About a minute later the guy at the pump was done. He backs up and before I can even put my car in gear Lexus woman pulls her car in front of mine diagonally, blocking me from pulling into the spot, and then pulls straight in after th first guy has moved.  She climbs out of her car and gives me the MOST INFURIATING little wave.  At this point my anger gives way to a ninja-like calm, and I know exactly what must be done.  I pull my car forward and stop ~6 inches from her rear bumper.  The air pump is in the corner of the lot, so Lexus woman has a curb in front of her, a curb to her right (where the pump is), an open spot to her left, and now my dirty ass car right behind her brand new one.  She is busy filling her tire and doesn\u2019t notice that I\u2019ve pulled right up to her car.  I step out of my car, grab my air compressor from the back seat and start setting it up to fill my tire.  Mr. BMW, who has remained completely still and silent, sees what I\u2019m doing and asks if I can fill his tires too.  I say \u201cof course\u201d and motion for him to park in the empty spot to Lexuslady\u2019s left.  As soon as he pulls in she notices what\u2019s happening and starts yelling.  I flip on my air compressor and begin filling my tire, her cries drowned out by the sound of 250psi of justice.  She comes\nand stands in front of me, face beet red and little flecks of spittle popping out from between her cigarette teeth as she calls me all sorts of names.  I calmly say \u201cMa\u2019am, I only have one tire to fill.  You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d.  Mr. BMW is absolutely loving this, and as I finish my tire and move to fill his she starts up again. \u201cYou motherfuckers, fucking piece of shit assholes etc.\u201d.  I finish Mr. BMW\u2019s tire and he thanks me for my help, climbs in his car and pulls away grinning.  I wrap my compressor up nicely, pick a good song, and set my climate control to a balmy 82 degrees, all while Lexus lady is trapped in front of me.  I calmly back up, give her a little wave, and drive off into the night.  \n\ntldr lady takes my spot at the air pump, I block her in and fill my tire and the gentleman behind me with my own very slow, very loud compressor.

Bought it after losing an alternator and having to replace one in an AutoZone parking lot and just kept in in the trunk of every car we've owned. Once lent it to a poor soul on the side of the road. Dh gave him his business card so he could return the set the next day. He did so along with a Starbuck's gift card. ",

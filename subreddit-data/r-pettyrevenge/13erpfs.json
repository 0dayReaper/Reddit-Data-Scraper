    "postText": "This occurred a little over a year ago but figured it\u2019s worth sharing \n\nLast year i received an invitation to interview with one of our direct competitors for the same position I\u2019m working. My name is known to my competitors and I\u2019ve been approached with job offers before \n\nAnyways, for me if an opportunity presents itself I would at the least entertain their offering\u2019s because you never know what might happen but the intentions are ultimately for a better paying position. So I go to the first interview and it\u2019s with the service manager, he\u2019s impressed with what I have to offer and asks for a 2nd interview with his head of sales manager, then another interview with higher management levels and another with the VP and yet another with everyone I\u2019ve already interviewed with and the CEO. All in all 7 interviews total \n\nNow here\u2019s the thing, this isn\u2019t my first rodeo and I know how to evade their bait questions where the only  proper answer would be to spill the beans on revenue numbers or customer naming with my current employer and I dodged all those questions with vague answers that leaves them with nothing of value but stays relative to their questions and I can feel their frustration that they\u2019re not getting what they\u2019re after. After the 7th interview I made it clear that I\u2019m no longer willing to entertain furthermore interviews and and we talked numbers and where I\u2019d like to see to entertain the possibility of joining their team and if they\u2019re still interested to shoot me an offer or if not then a letter that they\u2019re not interested in hiring me. \n\nLet\u2019s add that in one of the interviews the VP spilled the beans on his #1 cash cow customer that so happens to be directly across the street from their office in plain view and based on what I gathered from all the interviews is this company interviewing me is still a small player in the game and without this cash cow customer they wouldn\u2019t be much of a competitor to us \n\nFast forward 2 weeks later and I get an offer, the offer is being offered by the VP although it\u2019s clearly written that if I accept I will report to the manager I initially interviewed with, that I\u2019d retain the same job title except their dollar amount is 20% less than what I was making. 35% lower than the number said I\u2019d be willing to entertain\u2026.. I took that as an insult and immediately declined their offer and when they asked what would be my counter offer I politely declined any further communications with them, and boy was I pissed when I saw the number they offered me especially when I told them where I\u2019d like to be at pay range to entertain them as my new employer. \n\nA few weeks pass by hoping I\u2019d forget the insult of an offer but I just couldn\u2019t get over it, so I enlisted the help of one of the newly hired sales reps in our company that I got along with really well and asked him to accompany me in visiting a site I had my eyes on, after we got approval from upper management from both of our departments we set an appointment/meeting with the cash cow customer of the company that I interviewed with a month prior. \n\nDuring the meeting while the young sales rep is talking numbers to them I decided to run my mouth and offered them the option that instead of entertaining a 1 or 2 year contract to be their new service contractor we\u2019d be willing to pay the cancellation fee of early termination of their current contractor if they\u2019re willing to sign with us for 4 years maintaining a 7.5% annual increase adjustment for inflation and based on market evaluation (I was talking out of my ass as I haven\u2019t done any research and I haven\u2019t got the authority to back up those figures) I also gave them the guarantee that we would be on site within 24 hours of emergency break downs if they agree to the terms of the 4 year contract. \n\nWe left the meeting and the young sales rep is super excited that if he closes this deal he\u2019ll go from amateur to baller status overnight but super nervous that he never asked for permission to the guarantees I promised and this could be the end of our employment should they agree, I told him not to speak of the terms \n\n3 months go by with no word from them, the sales rep kept in touch with them though during that time then one day I get an email that\u2019s also cc\u2019s to the sales rep also that they\u2019d like to move forward with our proposal. \n\nA week later I got a write up for failing to follow the chain of command BS and 2 days of unpaid leave but our VP of sales signed the contract approving the conditions I outlined and assigned me as the lead contractor rep responsible for being the one who responds to the 24 hour breakdown guarantee if no one else is available, this in turn took me off the out of town travel list which is a blessing for me. \n\nFast forward 6-7 months later this customer has proven to be our company\u2019s 2nd highest profitable acquisition post Covid and the cost of paying the contract cancelation fee was overcome within the 4th week of service. I received a 25% pay raise and a management position which I declined the position but accepted the raise while retaining my current title. Also I just found out during our annual company meeting that me, young sales rep and our families are going to Hawaii for a two week vacation all expenses paid in December.  \n\nAnywho, I now intentionally mandate that whenever we\u2019re at this customer\u2019s site we park all of our service vehicles directly across the street from the former contractor\u2019s HQ in direct sight of their view, even if our work area is on the opposite side of the plant which I swear must have it\u2019s own zip code lol. \n\nDoes this count as petty revenge?",

It was him that I got all the details I needed to help me prepare for the sales pitch, I also vaguely asked my direct manager why don\u2019t we guarantee a 24 hour response time which he stated we can and have the man power for it but that\u2019s not his call to make. As for paying the early cancellation fee, it wasn\u2019t unheard of, it has been done before and I spoke to the two salesmen who\u2019ve done it regarding that topic and how it eventually played out for them, also this customer\u2019s profile showed promising results that making the offer to cancel their existing contract isn\u2019t going to greatly harm our business but it\u2019s a very risky move that not many are willing to accept if it goes sour. \n\nAlso our VP of sales allows the person to accompany the sales team in the initial visit if that\u2019s the person that tipped off the sales team about any specific future customer if he so wishes too and is approved by the department manager and the foreman (if it applies, which it did for me)\n\nI also gathered as much information about business politics as I can from the young sales rep, I took him out to lunch twice and explained to him how our side of the service world works since he was still relatively new to this field of work and he returned the favor, this significantly helped later during the pitch as I understood what almost all the numbers meant. \n\nI did my homework, I didn\u2019t just jump into a pool of sharks, I jumped in wearing a shark costume. \n\nI felt towards the end of the pitch was that its just going to blend in with the other bids before us and based on my research and newly gained knowledge (and the lack of fear of losing my job which I had a backup for at the time should shit hit the fan) did I decide to spice things up cause I really REALLY wanted to take this customer out from under the competition\u2019s contract. \n\nDuring the pitch I mixed what I knew with some made up stuff that at least all sounded realistic. But where I stepped out of bounds was for:\n\n  we\u2019ve never had a market adjustment for inflation and market research but I told them after Covid and the supply chain shortage we need to protect our investment and interests, that was hot air out of my ass. 4 years contract was unheard of, longest we\u2019ve ever had was 2 years, that was a move I pulled out of my ass too. the 24 hour guarantee that one nearly cost me my job and career as whole tbh I ate so much shit from upper management about it that I was on the verge of quitting but my manager and half the sales department fought it out for me and saved my job for me. \n\nThe raise was its own entity, that was its own battle but the acquisition of this customer significantly aided me in netting the percentage that I got\u2026 oh and I asked for it they didn\u2019t just hand it to me. Our former CEO is the one who approved my request for the raise (he\u2019s related to the current CEO) also after agreeing to the raise our current CEO offered me a position in management which I eventually declined as I was happy with what I was doing. The vacation was a reward for hitting certain goals I wasn\u2019t aware of, the young sales rep pretty much covered that entity I had no idea about it, he\u2019s the one who won the vacation, I found out later that I too was now going to that vacation.. family included. I think young sales rep convinced them of it. \n\nI don\u2019t have really anything else to add to this topic, I wish to maintain the privacy of all those involved.",

He told them his salary requirements and they did more than low ball him, especially after 7 interviews (he wasn't applying for CEO or lead technician for a nuclear power plant so this is basically unheard of for his type of position).  My brother, who's was a VP at universities and non-profits, may have 3 interviews for a job (typical one, one with the team and other department heads, then finally with the U president and HR for final selection).  So it was more than being unhappy with the money but having his time wasted and his existing company's financial situation risked for what wasn't a real offer (sure, they'd hire him for a well below market rate if he'd agreed).  He just played the game better.",

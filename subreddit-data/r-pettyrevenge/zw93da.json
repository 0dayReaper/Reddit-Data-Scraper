    "postText": "This year I got a new job that has been paying me very well. Therefore, for this Christmas I decided to splurge on everyone . In particular, I spent a lot of my money on my nine year old daughter and she deserves in 100%. She has been pushing herself in school, helping around in the house without being asked, and always being the kindest soul you'll ever meet.\n\nHowever, when my mother in law came early in the morning and saw how the gifts under our tree were much more than usual she asked why. I told her I bought everyone a bunch of gifts, including her. She then preceded to ask how much gifts I got my daughter and I told her about 3 big gifts and 3 mini ones. Apparently, this outraged her because she started saying that a nine year old did not deserve that many gifts and she would be taking away the gift she bought my daughter so that my daughter wouldn't be too spoiled. I told her that was unfair especially since my mother in law promised my daughter a doll for Christmas and my daughter was looking forward for it. My mother in law said let it be a lesson to my daughter that in life she cant get all things she asks for.\n\nLook I understand that, but its not like I shower my daughter in gifts everyday. And if anything Christmas is the day you are supposed to spoil your children. But my wife told me to let it go and it was her mothers gift and therefore she could do anything she wanted with it and her mother agreed saying it was her right.\n\nAnd if we were going to play with that ideology then so be it. I decided to remove the 600$ designer bag I got my MIL, the thing I knew she wanted the most, and gave her a 40$ robe instead.\n\nOnce my MIL opened her present she was disappointed asking if that was all from me, because everyone else got increasingly more expensive gifts from me. And I said yes and apologized if I disappointed her but we cant always get the gifts we hoped for.\n\nThis left both her and my wife extremely furious, but hey the MIL got enough gifts I wouldn't want to spoil her!",

My dad told her she either gives it to us or not, that's her choice, but there aren't conditions on Christmas presents. Plus, he bought the NES and she can't demand his property like that. We went home with the Super Nintendo. \n\nSome grandmas are just cruel for no reason. A few years later I was 14 and my grandma says she has a \"special\" gift for me under the tree. She kept talking it up the whole day (we always waited for our cousins to get there and we opened presents after Christmas dinner), making a huge deal out of it. My mom pulled me aside and said it probably wasn't a good idea to open it in front of everyone. I couldn't imagine why, it's a special gift from grandma! Yeah, it was a bra. She just laughed and laughed. And she wondered why I didn't come visit very often anymore.",

White elephant was compulsory, and when I was very young, 4 or 5, there were only three children in the extended family, myself, and my two cousins, 12 M&amp;F.  She had gotten three kids presents for us to choose without knowing what they were and one \"adult's table\" white elephant present.\n\nThe family circles around for the kids to open their presents, and grandma instructs me that as the youngest I got to choose the first present.  So I chose one of the three kiddy presents.  \"No, you don't want that one.\"  Of course, had been told to pick one, and I had, so I was crying to have it taken away, which was the whole point of letting me pick it in the first place I guess?  Anyway, next cousin Tim tries to choose the same gift I'd just had taken away 50/50 chance it was the one he was supposed to get, I guess?  Nope, really basically Sara has to get that one.  Tim was 12 and didn't give a fuck so he just grabbed the last gift and opened his bon jovi cassette or whatever the heck he got.  I also do not remember what I actually wound up with.  But I do remember what Sara got, because that has been canonized in the family legend forever: it was \\*\\*one tampon\\*\\*.  Merry Christmas!",

I am absolutely gobsmacked that grown adult women behaved like that, and *on Christmas* no less!!!\n\nYour MIL can gift anyone anything she wants, as can you. Conversely, she can withhold a gift from anyone she wants because she is awful, and awful people don\u2019t need logic to behave badly. However, I could not forgive a person who made my daughter pay the price because she (your MIL) is entitled, petty, and jealous. And you need to have a talk with your wife. Supporting her awful mother over her own daughter is the kind of wrong that can\u2019t be explained. \n\nReturn the designer purse (before your wife gives it to her mother).

(oh, and my sons birthday is 29th Dec too) \n\nCome Xmas morning, there is only me, my son and his dad there. When I was a kid, always had a big bundle to open and would space opening them out through the day. If I oy got my son 6 gifts, Xmas would feel almost over in 30mins.\n\nWe're not the kind of family who bring new toys into the house all year round, so to splurge in December feels the right thing to do.\n\nMIL is a judgey witch who didnt deserve her bag.",

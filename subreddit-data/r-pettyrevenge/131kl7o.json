    "postText": "Was on my way to work, I work in an axe throwing venue. Just driving down a straight street near my work, then a guy in a massive pick up truck flys out of a side street cutting me off and making me almost T-bone him. And he has the nerve to tell me to watch where I was going and called me an asshole and more abuse like I\u2019m the one at fault. Was super tired and a bit shocked so didn\u2019t have a response as I drove away but ended up laughing at the thought of it knowing I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nAnyway get to work and guess who\u2019s there? That\u2019s right it\u2019s little dick energy guy. Went straight behind the counter and said \u201cSorry you can\u2019t come in, I\u2019ve already seen you do something illegal as well as be abusive which isn\u2019t tolerated here.\u201d As we literally have axes everywhere! He didn\u2019t understand till I brought up the car situation. He argued a bit but in the end wasn\u2019t allowed in.\n\nWhole thing made my morning!",

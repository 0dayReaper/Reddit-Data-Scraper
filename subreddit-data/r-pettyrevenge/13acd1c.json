    "postText": "This is something that I\u2019ve been told is super petty by some friends. For reference I have a really bad relationship with my mother. Not to get into here. Ive always tried my best to avoid her but my grandparents (who raised me) are very old, and traditional, and believe in the whole \u201cshe\u2019s your mother we just have to love her and care for her and forgive her.\u201d Words that I\u2019ve taken almost exactly from their mouths. \n\nI got my license when I was well into being 16. She didn\u2019t help at all with my hours. She didn\u2019t want to help me at all. The only thing she did was take me to the DMV but I did everything myself, and my grandparents payed for it. My mother has always been a terrible driver, and gets really nervous on highways. She\u2019s an even worse passenger. She is the worst passenger I have ever had, or seen in my life. \n\nShe has always had the rule that the driver gets to choose the music in the car. This resulted in me listening to ass songs that I grew up hating, and being told to suck it up. I grew up with a taste in different music than what I was forced to listen to that she, unfortunately, knew and like some those songs too. The first time I drove in a car with my mother she was rude, very unnecessary scared to be my passenger (ei slamming on invisible second breaks, screaming and shouting at the top of her lungs, hitting me and making passes for the steering wheel). It made me mad as I already had my license, and everyone including her had told me that I was a really good driver. We were driving through the mountains so there was no radio. \n\nOn the way back down the mountain I was playing music from my phone plugged into the car and I could hear her singling along. My mother thinks that she\u2019s an amazing singer who could have been famous in another life, and that her voice is one of the best around to be heard. It is not. So when I realized she was singing along with my song I got mad and skipped it. It caused her to let out a little \u201caww\u201d and slouch a little. That made me very happy. So the entire ride any song that she started humming, singing, tapping her fingers with, anything at all, I would skip it. \n\nIt made her very annoyed and sad, but it was doing wonders for my mood. So I kept skipping songs, and it got to the point where any song that I knew, she knew I would skip just for the fun of it. She tried to bring it up and I countered with the fact that my entire life she said that the driver gets to pick the music, and she can\u2019t change her own rules now. That made her very mad, and me very happy. Ever since it\u2019s been something I do with her, and only her, anytime she says something annoying in the car, or makes me mad, or is just a bad passenger. It doesn\u2019t happen very often as I\u2019m an adult now and try my best to avoid her in literally every situation, but when it does happen it makes my day.",

I still remember this one day while I was driving that my mom had a total mental breakdown. Hitting the windows, screaming, crying, thrashing, the whole bit. She didn't hit me thankfully (trying to grab the steering wheel as you mentioned sounds absolutely terrifying, holy shit), but I refused to drive with her in the car for years afterward until she got therapy. I was also about 16/17. It happens and people can get all high and mighty about what you should have done, but they forget that you were a teenager who was just trying to survive and who had a totally fucked up idea of normal and safe behavior.",

STOP! STOP!!!\" I made an emergency full stop. On the highway. Without knowing why. Surely she had seen something I didn't, like a deer crossing from her side or something, right? Well, I'll never know. Next thing I know, it was my fault for obeying and stop, when she only \"lightly asked me to slow down\". \n\nShe later didn't understand why and berated me for not doing the last mandatory hours of driving with her but with my father, aka her ex-husband whom she feels competitive with over our affection. \n\nOnly now do I start to question my mother's standards...",

Another reminder that I was SIXTEEN. and STILL A MINOR. I was also still under her LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP. I would have loved to pull over but I feared more for my life, at the time, if I pulled over and tried to make her get out than if I would have gotten into a car crash. \u201cexcuses\u201d is strong to come straight out the gate with. \n\nWhen I mean there was no place to pull over I mean it. A winding one lane per side road, with no merging or passing areas just double yellow the whole way up. If I would have let her back in after, I would have had to deal with my stepfather, who was sitting in the back, and my mother when I picked her up. That was not something I was willing to sacrifice my life over at SIXTEEN. If my mom got her hands on me I would have suffered, if I got into an accident with someone coming down the mountain, head on, I would probably die on impact. That\u2019s the way I saw it then. When I was a minor. So chill out with the pointing fingers. It was her fault then and it\u2019s her fault that happened now.\n\nNow, as an adult, It\u2019s my responsibility to make sure that whoever is in my car isn\u2019t gonna fuck me over. As a minor I was more afraid of my mom and the things she could/would/had done than I was of dying in a car accident.\n\nI see what your trying to say and I appreciate the notion, but it\u2019s comes of a little victim blamey. That\u2019s all.",

I yanked the car back into my lane, hit the hazards (4-way lights) and continued on to the shoulder, where I stopped the car. I looked at her and very calmly said, \"If you ever touch the wheel when I am driving again, I will immediately stop the car and you will leave it. I don't care if we're in the middle of death valley in the summer. You never touch the wheel if you are not the driver. Are we perfectly clear?\" She agreed, I went to pull back onto the road, and discovered that she'd knocked the car out of drive into neutral. /facepalm That shit doesn't fly, kids. Be safe, and don't let passengers fuck with the driver.",

I don\u2019t drive her anywhere unless there is more than just me and her in the car (ei my grandparents). Even then I heavily insist on her driving her own car since we live at different residences. This story happens when I was SIXTEEN and A MINOR. I had no choice in the matter and I had no right to say no. I only grew a backbone as an adult. \n\nIm not sure what your first question is in relation to. I\u2019m assuming your responding to the person taking about how they pulled over and told their mom never to do that again. If that is that case I would, once again, like to reiterate that I was more afraid of my mother if I pulled over and did that, than if I got into a head on collision. If that\u2019s not what your taking about then I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what your referring to.\n\nThe use of \u2018apparently\u2019 in your sentence also makes your statement very flippant rather than making an observation or stating an your opinion. It\u2019s backhandedly rude. If you have a problem with how I acted as a MINOR under her guardianship then make your own comment rather than hiding here at the end of this thread. I see how this could look to someone who can\u2019t relate but understand that your comment can be seen in ways other then you may have intended it.",

She stormed over (in the parking lot of her job) and slapped me in the face telling me that I was grounded for two weeks for \u201clistening to that rap crap!\u201d She tried reaching past me to shut it off and I just left, turning it up as I did. She didn\u2019t act out like this very often but when she did it was over the most absurd things. I was the good kid out of my siblings and I for the most part. After that, I\u2019d roll up at home blaring Eazy-E\u2026 that showed her what rap really was. Donna Lewis isn\u2019t even close to it. \n\nNow as an adult with a 17 year old that drives his own car, any time she comes to visit and happens to ride with one of us, the rule is we listen to whatever WE want and we never, ever offer to change the station. It\u2019s usually 90\u2019s/2000\u2019s hits or old school gangster rap because that\u2019s just what we like. Sometimes it\u2019s rock or whatever else we are in the mood for. But we never listen to the old timey wailing country music that she lives for. \n\nThanks for the memory jog! She is coming to visit in a week or so and I\u2019ll remind my kiddo to enjoy his tunes.\n\nEdit: Autocorrect kept changing Eazy to Easy and I had to fix it back.",

I was in the back seat and said \"(brother's name) please get off at the next exit, I gotta pee\". He did so and my stepmother came into the bathroom with me because she always has to pee. I told her to knock it off she was making him anxious and I want to live. I told her that when we go back to the car she will be sitting in the back and will STFU.   \nI spoke with my brother later who said it was a constant issue \"(brother's name) drive faster! Don't be a pussy!\" \n\nDude WTF.",

My little brother was in the car as well but he is almost a decade younger than me so there wasn\u2019t much he could do and I don\u2019t blame him for that. I can say for sure that it definitely feels better to have someone agree with you, in the moment it feels very much your fault (even if you rationally know it isn\u2019t). My mother was the opposite in the sense that no matter how much under the speed limit I was going it was always too fast. If I ever slowed down (properly, not a hard stop) she would start to yell, and scream, and hard flinch. It just got worse depending on the situation.",

She told me that it\u2019s \u2018just how I am\u2019 and she wasn\u2019t going to change, or attempt to change, because she didn\u2019t think she was doing anything wrong.

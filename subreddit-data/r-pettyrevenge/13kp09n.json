    "postText": "Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/11a903c/put\\_a\\_lien\\_on\\_my\\_neighbors\\_for\\_not\\_being\\_able\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/11a903c/put_a_lien_on_my_neighbors_for_not_being_able_to/)\n\nSo a couple weeks ago we were all informed that there is going to be a second special assessment this year. Our last one was about $1/square foot, this one is $1.25/square foot. I'm getting a rhinoplasty next month and just can't afford to plop another $1250 to these people, and therefore I'm not paying. This combined with the SA from a few months ago equals about 45% of our building's income, well over the 5% limit in the state of CA. Several other people are not paying because they either can't afford it or simply think it's too much. Both are valid. He can lien my unit all day every day, I will go to the court hearing about it and get it thrown out.\n\nOur HOA recall election was tonight. 5 seats on the board, us individual homeowners put forth 3 candidates. The 3 of us spent many Sundays going door-to-door campaigning, and we did get a lot of neutral owners on board. With the ballots, you can either mail them in or fill them out in person. Most of us elect to mail them in and there were two questions on them:\n\n1) Do you approve of the recall election?  \n2) Place your votes for candidates in this grid.\n\nUnfortunately, several people skipped question 1 and approval for the recall was therefore less than 51%. The family of crooks that run our building now own 119 units out of the 180, and we just didn't get it. \n\nAfter the election, there was an HOA meeting. I find these things an absolute waste of time, a stupid meeting ran by stupid people, but I did show up about 20 mins late for about 10 minutes, and a literal fistfight almost broke out, and the family announced that even though I have a seat on the board, they are no longer including me in meetings because I am \"disrespectful\". People literally started SCREAMING.\n\nAnother owner made an audio recording of the whole thing and I sent it along to our attorney. Our HOA bylaws require mediation before litigation, and so we have that coming up in which we are asking for a large sum of money, our attorney fees, and this family to give up their positions of power and have their voting rights stripped permanently. If they refuse, we go to litigation and a judge will subpoena their financial records, which will show laundering, embezzlement, theft, and god knows what else, so I have a pretty good feeling they will accept to avoid the alternative, potential prison.\n\nAlso the house I put the lien on still hasn't sold so I still haven't gotten my $31 :( and our elevators still don\u2019t work.",

The folks on the board had no concept of money management and no idea to plan for the future. We have private roads, so our estimated cost of replacing all the \u201ccommon areas\u201d is ~1.5m. Most of it is for the road and sidewalks. They had $216 in the bank when the special assessment was implemented. The management company just never told them they couldn\u2019t afford stuff, so they spent and spent. \n\nThe management company was fired. All the board members were kicked off. The special assessment is 7 years at $45 a month and 3 years at $35 a month. 175 homes and no one had thrown a fit that the money was slowly disappearing. There must\u2019ve been red flags for years. \n\nI\u2019m an accountant so I joined the board and am now treasurer. I intend on staying on the board as long as we own the house (and as long as I\u2019m voted to stay on). I just don\u2019t trust other people with my financial health lol I tell all my friends to send me their potential HOA\u2019s financial statement before they buy a house. You want to know what you\u2019re getting into. I was fine buying the house since we had the special assessment, but I can\u2019t imagine buying it before the special assessment.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how difficult it is to find 5 competent people out of 175 households! We have a lady now who just tells about speeding and people not picking up dog shit. She stays quiet until those items come up lol",

We have a zoom meeting every other month for about 1.5 hours. They send out a management report with info of anything going on and any contracts to vote on like for tree removal, broken fence and the like. I am Treasurer so virtually approve invoices before they\u2019re paid, which is maybe 5 a week on a busy week, sometimes none. Takes 5 minutes to review and check prices match what they should. Before I was President and then Treasurer, I didn\u2019t have any responsibilities between meetings really. We get \u201carchitectural change requests\u201d maybe once or twice a month, which is a quick email vote. That part is nice because people usually just attach their contractor\u2019s quote so I know what the \u201cgood\u201d price would be for things like decks, fences and roofs. It\u2019s overall much less work than it seems!",

It's a great neighborhood and no one gives a flying fuck about HOA rules. For examples we're not supposed to have inlaw housing, Farm animals, flags on display....nearly every house has a flag, several have chicken coops and inlaw housing. Also I had a logger with a tree shear come through my property before a huge wind storm in December. He absolutely DESTROYED my yard/hill and refused to help us clean it up after he got the lumber he wanted. So it sat until now and we haven't heard a peep from keeping an untidy yard or anything.",

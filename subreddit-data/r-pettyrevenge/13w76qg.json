    "postText": "I recently had my 37th birthday. In the state I reside it\u2019s my constitutional right to have marijuana recreationally. Decided I wanted to smoke a few bunts so I went by my local gas station to buy some White Owls. \n\nI go up to the counter and ask for a pack. The employee, I\u2019ll call him Dave, asks for my id. I give it to him and he walks to the back wall and grabs them. Then he says in a very sarcastic tone, \u201cOhhhhh sorry buddy. I can\u2019t sell them to you. Good luck next time though.\u201d I\u2019m confused so I asked why. He tells me my license is expired. He gives it back, smirks, and says, \u201csorry to ruin your birthday.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve worked with the public, including a gas station, so I know people are assholes and the job sucks. So I just calmly asked, \u201creally?\u201d He laughed a little and said yes. I left empty handed and a little annoyed by the minor inconvenience inflicted upon me on my day of birth.\n\nA few weeks later I go to the same gas station for the same product and Dave is working. He walks to the back wall, turns and asks, \u201cgot your card?\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s allergy season and I\u2019m really congested so my hearing actually does suck certain times of the year.  I wanted to be 100% sure i heard him correctly so I said, \u201cexcuse me?\u201d \n\nIn that very sarcastic tone he repeats what he said but this time I definitely heard him. But I also heard the annoyance in his voice. So I reply, \u201cmy car? No I didn\u2019t get any gas.\u201d \n\nThis time he lets out a very loud sigh says \u201cID. Do you have your ID?\u201d At that exact moment a customer walked in and the door made that dinging sound so I took the opportunity to keep going with it and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry buddy, I just can\u2019t hear you.\u201d \n\nHe stomps over and asks again. I politely say yes then proceed to take as long as humanly possible to dig my license out of my wallet. We proceed with the transaction without further incident. \n\nNow every time I go in and ask for those I pretend I can\u2019t hear him but do so in the most polite way possible. It seems to drive him crazy. \n\nDave will now forever feel the plight of my petty revenge.\n\nEdit: A few details I forgot to add\u2026I don\u2019t think they have to card every time in the state. The night shift guy and manager have never carded me. Dave has never carded my 30-year-old wife. I\u2019m not wanting Dave to risk a fine or his job. It was a bummer he wouldn\u2019t sell to me. Its my fault with the license and all. It\u2019s more how he laughed and mocked me about it for seemingly no reason. \n\nAfter looking through the comments I realize it had until the end of the day before it expired. Dave you were wrong!\n\nEdit 2: There are State Constitutions. In my state legalizing marijuana was placed on a ballot initiative and it\u2019s an amendment in the constitution. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s illegal on the federal level. \n\nI appreciate the 5,000 lawyers who are screaming at me that it\u2019s illegal for him to take an expired ID. I know this and I\u2019m not upset about that. He has to decline the transaction when he saw the ID was expired and it is what it is. However, he was rude as hell with me twice on two separate occasions before I started my petty revenge. There\u2019s many ways to decline a sale without being an asshole. Dave decided to be a dick.",

He wrote a check to the pharmacy in Jan 2022, and just got a collections notice last month. We send out our checks the same week they're written, goes to the bank directly. He wanted a refund on the spot, then when we told him that's an issue for corporate since we clearly no longer have his check, he wanted corporate names. \"Who do I talk to in corporate about this, I want names!\" Bro, we only know pur district managers name, and thats a first name.

The grocery store across the road had the policy that EVERYONE got carded.

I couldn't care either way, but it was pretty amusing how pissed off the grocery store started making people.",

You had to go to the liquor store to get full-strength beer.\n\nI would expect Alabama to have the most restrictions out of those three states, but they were the most liberal. Go figure.\n\nCaveat: I have no idea if any of these policies are still true. This is all based on experiences of about 20 years ago.",

Though I must say it's nice that the average person seems to be ignorant that cold/allergy meds can be used to make meth. Half of my customers get confused about getting carded over benadryl or nyquil.\n\nAnd expired cards are legally required to be refused, no matter your age. You can be 65 years old, but if your ID is expired, I legally cannot sell you your beer or cigarettes. Luckily I just dont care anymore and only check birthdate bc the system asks me for specific date. I have better things to do than argue with people who care more about their liquor and cigarettes than making sure their ID is current. Yes, I had one dude more pissed about being refused beer than that he lost his driver's license, then proceeded to burn out his truck tires on the way out.",

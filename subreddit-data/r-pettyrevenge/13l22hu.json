    "postText": "Marking NSFW cause swear \n\n\nThis happened about an hour ago. \n\nA little back story: Today marks about a week since I left my last job, and I have plenty of time to kill before I start my new job. I am taking this time as a vacation, afterall I have worked hard, and all my bills are paid up for 3 months. So, today, I went to go get coffee, cigarettes, and gas from down the road. I get to the gas station, and there's this middle-aged gentleman buying some lottery. He is taking his time buying scratch tickets and draw games, and I mean REALLY taking his time. \n\n\n\nNo problem, I think. I have nowhere to be and nothing to do. I have the time. \n\n\n\nThe first 3 minutes go by, and he's got several different draw games that he's fumbling into his little plastic lottery pouch. 'OK,' I think, 'my turn'. \n\n\n\nNope! The guy starts scratching the scratch tickets he bought... at the counter. The cashier doesn't look happy and tells the guy not to scratch them at the counter, and the indecisive lottery guy waves him off. Saying something about \"It'll be just a minute.\" The cashier tells him there's a line, the gambler looks back at me (the only person in line) and says, \"He'll be fine.\" This is about 5 minutes in line now.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think to myself that this guy is rude, and I could leave and go to another gas station and get home faster. But it's fine. I have the time. I'll 'be fine.' \n\n\n\nThe guy finishes scratching his tickets and starts looking them over. I don't think he's got any winning tickets. He tries making small talk to the cashier about \"a big one,\" or something, while digging into his pocket for his wallet.  He pulls out a $20 bill and asks the cashier for the current numbers on the $20 lottery books, clearly thinking the ticket number meant something. 'Rude AND Superstitious' I think. Lottery guy goes back and forth between two ticket books. \"Give me the ticket with number 143... no, wait, the one with 78... no, wait, 143!.... no no no,  wait, wait, give me 78, 78's the one.\" He pays and begins scratching the ticket at the counter again. It's been about 8 minutes in line now. The cashier is dead inside. I'm a bit fed up. This gambler is just inconsiderate.\n\n\n\nThe gambler finishes scratching, sees that he lost, mumbles something about \"the next one\", and walks over to the atm. My turn! \n\n\nCue petty revenge.\n\n\n\nI walk up to the counter and say loudly, \"can I get (cigarettes), (gas) on pump 3, and that $20 ticket number 143, please.\" The lottery guy hears this and shoots me an absolute side eye. (It doesn't help my case that the atm is not in direct eye line of the counter and i had turned my body to watch him side eye me... I was being petty. I had to witness my damage.) So I pay the bill, turn around and walk 3 feet to the lottery checker and scratch then scan just the redemption code, and *boop* \"WINNING TICKET PLEASE SEE RETAILER\" flashes on the screen. \n\n\n\n\nI turn around, walk 3 feet back to the cashier as the lottery guy finishes at the atm, so I'm now first in line with the lottery guy behind me. The cashier scans the redemption code and the machine does its trumpet chime as the screen flashes \"$100 winning ticket!\". I tell the cashier I'll take the cash.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lottery guy is all pissy at the whole thing, and as I walk toward the door, I got the best petty revenge of my life.\n\n\n\nLottery guy: \"Hey, BUD. THAT was MY FUCKIN ticket! I was just at the atm! I was just coming back to buy that, BUD.\" \n\n\n\n\nMe: \"Well, I bought it, so it means you didn't buy it, which means that it's mine since I bought it.\" \n\n\n\n\nLG: \"That's not right, bud, that was my ticket. That's not the correct thing to do, dude. I got a wife and a baby on the way. I can give ya the $20 for the money YOU spent on MY ticket but I need that $100, that was my fucking ticket dude.\"\n\n\n\nMe: \"Oh, I didn't know. So you got a pregnant wife and you need this $100?\" \n\n\n\n\nLG: \"yes!\"\n\n\n\n\nMe: *half out the door* \"You'll be fine.\" And then I go out to pump gas, then leave. I'm a little surprised the guy didn't chase after me or try to fight me.\n\n\n\nFunny thing is I don't normally play the scratch lottery tickets anymore, so if he were polite in line I wouldn't have purchased winning ticket number 143.",

Comes over and tells us how he runs a side business where he buys up all the equipment in an office and then turns it over and resells it. He has an office coming up that he can probably double the money but he needs $2,500 to add to his $2,500 to make the deal. \n\nThat night I looked at my wife and said should we do that and she said absolutely not which was good enough for me. So a couple weeks later new IT guy comes not Raj. We practically interrogated them about where Raj was and he finally admitted that he had been fired because he had talked a different client into giving him the money and he had taken it right up to Charlestown and lost it at the poker table. And when he got fired his wife found out and it turns out that she thought he'd been fired 6 months ago and was just going out and pretending to work because he was embarrassed. \n\nWhen she found out that he had been working the whole time but just losing his entire paycheck at the poker tables she threw him out of the house and locked the doors. I ran into him face to face at a 7-Eleven about 3 months later and it was rather awkward.\n\nUpdate to be a little more clear: Raj actually worked for our IT contractor and he took care of multiple offices.  He didn't actually work for my company.",

They quit their job, spend all their money and are back working a job that pays less than their old job. Sometimes with massive debt to pay off. This can happen in just a few months.\n\nThere are exceptions of course. This one lawyer comes to mind, played every now and then and won. The first thing he did was go to an accountant and work everything out before he claimed the money. Built a budget around it. He is doing great last I heard.\n\nMost people are not this lawyer.",

Work, family, ex-wife, being tight on money, that he ages, that he can't have his dream car, that he lost money on an ex-gf 20 years ago, etc etc. Literally everything.\n\nAs said, money was tight. We had combined normally enough income to not live well off, but ok. So this wasn't the problem.\n\nHe was still not divorced from his ex-wife (as far as I know he isn't till now, years later), but separated. In my country you can get better tax rates as a married couple, but you have to live together. So from his income a big chunk went away after the separation (and me telling him to fix this, cause otherwise one day the tax office will probably check). But he was still buying loans for renovations of her house (shortly after moving there she got to ill to work and never applied for welfare, just lying on his pockets), cars that wasn't even his anymore (on sold way under worth, one totaled) and part if our regular expenses.\n\nAlthough we had to ask his mother for money on a monthly base, he gambled. Every week. Never won anything, max 1-5 Euros, with a ticket costing 5-25).\n\nAnd every time we got a bit money (like a bonus from work or whatever) he just blew it.\n\nIn the end it were other things, why I told him to get lost, but now, around 3 years later, he is still simmering in a \"nanny apartment\" at his brothers house, cause every flat on his own would be to expensive (cause finances not sorted out) or not good enough for his snobby arse. Like for example he is absolutely against apartment buildings, although I for example lived in some and was mostly happy.\n\nSome people are just a walking facepalm.",

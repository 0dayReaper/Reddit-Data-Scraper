They like to play the \"If I leave 1 piece on the roll it doesn't count as empty so I don't have to change it\" game. \n\nMy solution: \n\nIf the roll is left empty or with 1 or 2 pieces I will GLADLY put a new one on the holder... the wrong way around.\n\nI don't care if it's \"backwards\" but I know it bugs the hell out of them because it's always turned around the next day. The best part is that they can't say anything because then they would have to admit that they never change it.",

Sometimes, you do what you gotta do. Informed them that they were on their own for TP. \nThey didn't take me seriously until they found the empty roll that they expected me to change out.

Before I volunteered, it was used very rarely while living there. \n\nI stopped the volunteering because of not wanting to close the bag while making sure I didn't get their mucous on me. I ended up making sure my items were thrown into the kitchen garbage can that they didn't own, and left the trash bag alone after I emptied it out the last time I put something in there.

    "postText": "So i just resigned from my job (small company) cause my manager would not pay me on time, he would avoid me on pay day and i would have to seek him out and ask why he hasn\u2019t paid me yet. I work remotely so we dont see eachother often. Granted he wasnt always this bad, but he always paid me later than he was supposed to. This year however it got worse as the company started doing badly. Im an understanding person but what irritated me more than anything was how id have to ask him why im not paid instead of him informing me that things are bad and will salary will be delayed. So I started planning my exit plan. We also had a big project that we were working on and was supposed to be presented for the clients. Comes presentation day i dont show up, he texts and calls and i ignore him. Then later that day i emailed him my resignation. I thought i should make him feel what he\u2019s made me feel for months",

(By the way, he spent a lot of time repairing twisted serpentine chains.  One day, he warned me about them, saying \"Serpentine was never meant to be twisted.\")  \n\nI was very young, very green and still living at home, so at first I didn't really understand how cheap (and more than a little crooked) my employer, the retail company, was, but I learned.  One of the first lessons came through the self-employed jeweler.  I think he was in his mid-30s at the time, married with a couple of young children, and overall seemed a decent guy.  \n\nThis was before electronic deposits were standard in most places, so the company paid him every two weeks by mailing him a check.  There came a payday when no paycheck appeared.  He called the home office about it, who apologized and assured him the error would be fixed immediately.  A few days later--same thing.  A few days more, still no paycheck.\n\nAs I said, this independent jeweler seemed a decent guy overall, but he did have a temper and he was no wimp.  And naturally by now he was furious.\n\nThis time he called not the company's home office, but the company president \ud83d\ude42  He told the man that for every day after that that his paycheck didn't come, he would take a piece of jewelry out of the display cases and sell it on the street for whatever he could get.\n\nHis paycheck arrived the next day, Fed Ex overnight \ud83d\ude0a",

So if they're not going to pay me on time I'm not going to show up on time and I'm not going to bust my ass.\n\nOr maybe it was the fact that I threatened to call the labor board because there are laws on how long can go without getting paid after having done the work. Funny how when you bring up the legality of what they're doing they get motivated to want you to keep your mouth shut and so they do the thing they should have been doing originally.\n\nMy paycheck wasn't late after that. I understand that wouldn't work with most places but I got lucky that it worked with this one.\n\nThis is the reason I will never ever again work for a mom and pop business. I've never had my paycheck fucked with by a large corporation or retail entity it's always been direct deposit and always been on time. The only people that can't seem to not fuck that up are the mom and pop places.",

I had to take a job at about half the previous pay just to have something while I found something similar to what I had previously. We\u2019ll I found this little shop where it was family run and very small with some pretty good clients. One of the stipulations was we only got paid once a month on the 1st. Well beggars can\u2019t be choosers so I took it. First month comes around and it\u2019s the 1st, payday. Seems strange but all the management are somehow gone for the day early and no paycheques given out. Ok the next day I come in and ask what\u2019s up and they give me my cheque. Next month rolls around and the same thing, no one in the office on pay day. Now I\u2019m getting pissed because I have bills to pay on time and I\u2019m getting paid half of what I should be and not even on time. The next month rolls around and they pull the same stunt again. Now I\u2019m pissed. I stop doing any work and demand to be paid before doing another ounce of work. They cut me a cheque and I pick up a few things on my desk and tell them I\u2019m going to the bank. I go to the bank, deposit my cheque and get on the bus and go home. I literally ghost them and they blow up my phone for the next two weeks trying to figure out what happened ( like it\u2019s not totally obvious ) but I never reply and leave them on read. I screwed then over for a few clients and ended up running into the owner on the street a few months later. He looked at me and I nodded to him but that was as far as we ever communicated after that.

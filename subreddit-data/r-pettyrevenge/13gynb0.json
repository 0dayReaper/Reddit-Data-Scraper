    "postText": "So I've worked over there for about a year. At first all was OK, i was the planning director, I had a few issues but they mostly were the results of the place not having a proper system.\nI'm good enough with Excel to bypass most of the difficulties. When the 2nd logistic director in a year left I ask for that position cause i couldnt deal with the planning issues mostly comming from logistic and the accounting. Well I get both job for a while and I realised most of the shit is done by the accountant (late purchase, non paiment of suppliers, bad informations, etc.) Thats when thing get bad. Ive start to look for another job and even tough about quitting even if that mean no social insurance money after that. But with 3 kids and a morgage I didnt. Every week i was more and more angry. Then I realised the company was deep in the red, the boss didnt like me figuring it out by myself. \nTwo weeks later we have a meeting and he tell the situation to all employes but reasure everyone no jobs are in danger. I say to some coworkers \"ya right in a week people will be fired\". I was almost right since I was not fired but temporaly layoff like all the people dislike by the accountant, HR includes, when I learn it I just laugh. I gave my laptop grinning, I have turn all of the tools for planning and logistic at a level of Excel only I could use in the company.\nThe week-end pass and on monday I get call to explain how things work.\n\"Sorry im not being paid, so i'm in no obligation to work, you can hired me as a consultant but ill be more expensive then as an employee\". \nThey didnt call back directly after that, they ask my team do it. I do feel bad my teams had to deal with that issue, but I was consider non-essential.\n\nIve found a better paid job with more vacation, less hours per week and advantage. So everything is good ? No I've learn of some illegal move the accountant did. They were still owning me money, they refuse to pay. The illegal stun : To save money to the company she put herself on illness leave meaning shes being paid 80% of her salary by the social security insurance and the boss pay the 20% remaining. Well thats illegal, i learn shes doing it... i did the thing any good citizen concern for how its taxes are being uses would do. I told everything. Now she might be accuse of criminal fraud, will have to pay back everything and my ex boss will have a massive ticket to pay.",

    "postText": "Not my story but recently happened to a friend of mine. Personal details omitted obviously.\n\nMy buddy Steve has worked at a small business for over 10 years. Most of his time there has been pretty alright but recently it has become a remarkably worse place to work. Steve is the most senior employee outside of management and by far the most productive. He's always training new hires, working extra hours, helping other departments, you name it.\n\nPretty often, Steve will come in for a couple hours on his day off to take care of backed up paperwork and general housekeeping of his department. This does wonders for keeping the department running smoothly, especially when they are busy. Management knows about this and approves.\n\nGoing into the holidays this year, they are absolutely slammed, as usual. Orders are backing up and it's all hands on deck, extra hours, full tilt. After another 60 hour work week, Steve has a couple days off. On his 2nd day off, he decides to go into work for a few hours. He knows his coworkers are likely too busy to be taking care of the side stuff, so he's being a team player and helping out.\n\nWhile he's finishing up and about to leave, Steve's manager comes up to him and they have the following conversation.\n\n \"Hey Steve, quit messing around, get back out there and do your job\"\n\nSteve replies \"Hey Manager, sorry, its my day off, I'm not scheduled to work this shift. I'm just helping out, leaving in like 5 min.\" \n\nManager replies \"The hell you are, get your ass out there.\"\n\nSteve says, \"Nope, not happening. I'm going home.\" \n\nThe next day, Steve is predictably brought into the office, dressed down, and written up for insubordination. But there's a few things about Steve that you should know, that his employers knew but either forgot or didn't care about.\n\n1. Steve has been getting fed up with his employer for a while now.\n\n2. Steve is quite financially stable, as he works in a high-demand industry, and his wife also has a fantastic well paying job. \n\n3. Steve is about to become a dad. In fact, he is very very close to becoming a dad, right after the holidays most likely. \n\nSo, Steve is in the manager's office, just finished getting talked down to, and handed his write up to sign. Steve signs his write up, and hands it back, along with an envelope with a short letter inside. \n\n\"What's this?\" manager asks.\n\n\"My two weeks notice.\" \n\nCue the backpeddling. Manager is apologetic, asks for Steve to at least finish the holiday rush, big boss comes in and offers a raise if he stays, the whole shebang. Steve turns it all down. \n\nNow Steve's former employer has to get through the holidays without their most reliable worker, which will take at least 2 or 3 new hires to cover.\n\nMeanwhile, Steve can enjoy the holidays without stress, help prepare for the arrival of their baby, and start looking for work again when they're good and ready.\n\nEDIT: Obligatory \"Wow this post blew up\" reaction. \n\nSome clarification: Steve's position is hourly, and he got overtime pay for the extra hours. The stuff he worked on during these extra hours would collectively save his department alot of time and headaches, that's why he did it. There used to be a good team vibe in the company from top to bottom, coworkers who were genuinely friends and good teammates, so going the extra mile made a good thing even better. Not so much towards the end.\n\nAlso, giving his two weeks instead of quitting on the spot was a combination of professional courtesy and also giving his coworkers enough warning to not completely blindside and bury them.",

I was one of their top 3 performers, and not particularly well paid for it already. \n\nI got put on a performance plan because they didn't think I was \"on the phone enough\"--I called people but I also used e-mail instead when I thought it was more appropriate. I was flabbergasted but signed it, went back to my desk, and had a realization: I could get another job pretty easily, they were going to be put out for a good while trying to replace me. So I stood up, said \"fuck this,\" handed a bobblehead I'd gotten as an \"award\" to a guy who was always saying he wanted it, announced \"I quit\" and walked out the door. \n\nThey lost a couple more people shortly thereafter and wound up changing/upping the commission calculations for that position. I got a much better job I stayed at for 6 years.",

My time is supposed to be 4 out of 5 days a week direct care with our mental health clients, 1 paperwork day a week. Supposed to talk with coworkers about areas of weakness and how to improve, etc. \n\nExcept most have realized our site allows easy access to just not give a fuck. So they will sit on their phones, and anything I said just in one ear out the other. I tried to be the motivator of how good things could get if we put even a small amount of effort into improving things, so I busted my ass trying to get my tasks done and repeatedly showing people different ways to help them remember to get theirs done so things could improve, was naive enough to hope they weren't doing it maliciously. \n\nThen over two years so far as things never improved, I've become more frustrated trying to keep any hope, been repeatedly told \"we will get this addressed, but here's also some feedback of how you have continued to handle this worse and worse.\" While coworkers have shown signs of retaliating in response to me trying to do my job and get them to do theirs, my position isn't mandatable, yet if a replacement staff is late, they'll just leave anyway while I'm waiting for somebody to physically replace me at my current location, actively coach newer staff on how they do things and to ignore what I try to teach them, etc.\n\nBetween getting mandated again when I shouldn't have been able to, and a coworker yelling at me the same day trying to tell me how to do my job, my work ethic finally snapped. I dont try to correct anything anymore. I'll note what they did and move on. I focus as much as I can purely on what I am expected to get done and ignore everybody else's tasks not getting done. It sucks in that it does hurt to see everything sliding backwards, but after shoving a 10-12 hour effort into 8 hour shifts multiple times, I finally realized I wasn't getting results or acknowledgement for it, definitely not being paid appropriately to do so either. So even my own tasks take astronomic effort to get myself to get moving on them (since my tasks are program guidelines that my coworkers arw supposed to follow, which they dont so it feels like a farce with no point). Plod along real slow, but at least once I actually get to go home, I've finally let the stress just slide off. Don't think about work at all until I'm going back. \n\nThe job as described, I love the concept, just going to bid my time hoping I find a better run site to jump into.",

But I'm not sold.\n\nA few other guys in my department sign up for it but I skip it.\n\nThe first few months it's all a bunch of giving me shit when they're ducking out an hour or two earlier on Friday and I have to stay.\n\nBut little by little, the boss just started setting expectations at their new \"high productivity\" normal. And gradually our work log grew until we had a constant backlog of stuff to be done.\n\nI knew the other shoe had dropped the first Friday that nobody left early because we were all so busy. I said nothing, but I figured it was the end of the good times.\n\nWithin the next few months, things had transitioned from getting out a few hours early every Friday, to these guys being ask/told to work an hour or two extra most days, and still working to the end of the day on Friday.\n\nAfter a while, it was clear that the company's idea of flex time was basically having a soft claim on up to 12 hours, every day, and if they couldn't find some way to fill it, okay go home...but then of course their goal became to ensure that never happened.\n\nNot long after that, most of the guys that had opted into the flex thing started trying to opt back out, and as they pushed harder, then we started hearing rumors about mandatory overtime, because we couldn't possibly get all this shit done in the time frame the company had given its clients.\n\nNot too long after that, I found a much better work environment and peaced out, so unfortunately I'm not sure how it all ended, but they're still in business, last I checked.",

The core staff were all there probably 4+ years on average. \n\nBut the year prior, the owner sold the company. Made good too, in part, I kid you not, because the buyer didn't know the difference between markup and margin. Anyway...he came in, not from the area, not knowing the staff or customers and started making wholesale changes. Granted, some probably were needed... we'd been profitable but flat for the previous couple years. \n\nAbout six months into the new reign, while he was increasing pay for techs (I was sales manager at the time, but also doing some tech work), I asked for a raise. Here's why, and I presented the evidence: I was directly responsible for 40% to nearly 60% (depending on month) of monthly revenue. I think we were 14 or 15 employees at the time. He declined, and I began plotting. \n\nGave notice during a staff conference call, because, as was his routine, he was only in the office on rare occasion... caught him completely by surprise. In the days that followed, he offered all kinds of incentives, followed of course by threats. But I left.\n\nWhat he didn't know is that I had people that reported things to me after I left, including by IM during a staff meeting within days of me leaving, where I was blamed for all manner of things. \n\nCustomers found out, and quite a few followed me. But maybe more importantly, me leaving opened the floodgates...long time staff, one by one, in rapid succession, left. \n\nWasn't too much longer before they closed their doors permanently.",

Once there, they think it was their tech skills that did it and not their felating skills, so \"their way\" is the correct way.  This works for a while based on corporate inertia, but things change and they don't.  The middle managers got used to things running ok, so they never had to take bad news to their bosses.  The bosses never hear bad news, so they don't see a need to change anything.  Things start falling apart at the bottom, which get patched and hidden by the middle managers.  Then something big breaks that the middle managers can't smooth over, which gets the uppers involved to \"fix things,\" but because they weren't aware of what the problem actually is, they make the bad decisions that the lower levels hate.  Rinse and repeat over various time scales and levels of severity of problems.",

I know this gets said a lot, but I've seen kids choose to stay home for the first 2 years of their post-college job and save and they start life with fuck-you money. It's a game changer. I've seen people sell their house and move to a small one and double up the kids for a while and stock away money and their entire life changes once they get that cushion. I knew a girl who took an apartment next to her work and didn't have a car for 5 years, and it changed everything for her.\n\nIt's not always possible, and it's certainly not fun, and sometimes it would just be suicide to go without a car or move in with your mom or friends or whatever, so it's not for everyone. But every now and again, it's a clever hack that can really step things up.\n\nOh, I just remembered a friend who sold his house and moved into a fucking double-wide. He's making 220,000 a year. But he moved in to a fucking trailer park. So I guess he's just stacking it up right now. His kids are grown, so he could risk leaving the good school district.\n\nYou know, if you can swing it, it can be worth it to get the stairway out of the rat trap we're all in.\n\nHell, I'm thinking about the next step for myself and I think a trip to the slums for a year or two might make all the difference.",

My previous job was extremely toxic and I left it because I was constantly getting yelled at by customers and managers over things that I didn\u2019t have control over and I had told my new boss when I got hired I promise to be their best employee but wasn\u2019t taking the blame for any issue I can\u2019t control. So when the GM tried to write us up over something I LITERALLY can\u2019t control (I mean we told them when to return when they pick it up, we called them before we closed on the day they\u2019re due back, then call every day until it gets returned) I simply picked up my purse and walked out the store. Had a substitute teaching gig booked that same day. On the day I walked out my manager happened to be off so the GM was stuck working there the rest of day. Later that week the GM and manager called me and begged me to come back promising not to try anything that stupid again. I did go back (was a college student and the slow atmosphere made it easy to study and work at same time) and he never tried anything that stupid again.",

So everyone would get a vacation if they needed and other coworkers could cover the other. But after 2months, the other recruit got fired/laid off because she couldn't keep up with everything and had to ask basic question you ask on you first day of work after 2 months.\n\nNow, over 2 yrs, we have the same workload, but 2 employees quit within that time and i was given those two employees workload and was told it was a temporary situation and they will hire a replacement. Vacations are starting to look sketchy because its only me and 2 other employees handling a job of 7 people. If i take a day off due to sickness, no one covered my table and i was expected to catch up and finish my job the next day. So from this, i learned vacations are nonexistent, and we should work together to get through the days. \n\nIn 2020, i announced that i will be a father next yr, i was told that the company will do everything they could to follow the guidelines for paternal leave. 2021, baby was born and i texted everyone that i am starting my paternity leave on a sunday 11:59pm, Monday 6am, i got a text that we are short handed and if i could come into work half day to finish everything and hand everything off to someone as it was last minute. I said sure like an idiot and left my newborn baby and wife alone in the hospital for a half day work, and then they asked me the next day to do another half day, eventually i was just going to work everyday as if i never had a paternity leave. I was stressed the whole time that I dont even know if i got paid overtime or paid paternity leave with my salary. \n\nWhen december of that year hit, i got covid and they still expected me to work from home while taking care of a newborn with covid. I just lost my shit and quit on the spot. I couldnt handle a work from home and covid baby and covid self. When the city themselves said if you got covid, you get 2 week sick leave. I just dropped everything and quit on the spot. my manager was upset that i quit abruptly, i just said yes i quit, i dont care. I am sick and just quit. Got a few more text and phone calls from upper management saying theyre sorry to see me leave, but was i sure i wasnt going to give them a 2 week notice? I said yes, and ignored all phonecalls and texts afterwards. Took a 5month break and vacation with family since i didnt have one for 4 yrs and found a job with awesome benefits and paid me 1.5x more and actual employees that cover you if you have vacations.\n\nI am going to go to a 2 week vacation next yr with my wife and baby and dont regret quitting my last job. Fuck them.",

            "comment": "I'll never forget the last shift I threw pizza.  Saturday night in a college town and we were completely slammed.  Gluten-free was in its most \"fad\" state at the time, but since we knew it was also a real thing, we treated it like any other allergy; this meant a new apron, full arm scrub to the elbows (because flour) new gloves, into the prep kitchen with ingredients specifically prepped for GF, etc. etc.  It wasn't the end-all-be-all of extra work, but on a busy night, it really threw off your rhythm when you got caught on one.  That night, I got caught on ALL 12 that came through.  It wasn't planned (or at least I don't see how anyone could have planned it); it just always happened to land on me.  I made more GF pies than regular, and with the added time to wash and everything, I was way behind in total pies made (which is apparently a metric they tracked... not that we were particularly aware of the fact at the time).  Anyway, I'm set to open the next day, so I jump off the line a bit before close and make sure the dishes are caught up and clock out right as we close... just like every other turnaround.\n\nSo the next day rolls around, I open up and get started opening up the kitchen to get ready for lunch, and our GM comes in right at open (not unusual, since he'd been the closing manager the night before and all the openers had keys and knew what needed to be done) and passes me as I'm having a smoke out back; I tell him the stations are good to go and he doesn't have anything to worry about helping with in the kitchen, which is usually what he'd be doing first thing.  His response:\n\n\"Yeah, you're killing it on these openings, but we've really gotta get your throwing up to speed.  You were way behind everyone else last night.\"\n\n...\n\nThis asshole, who stood on the same line throwing dough, who even commented about how crazy it was that all the GF orders were landing on me, now has the balls to walk in here and tell his second-best kitchen worker to tighten up...  Anyway, after some undisclosed amount of time in which I saw red, then purple, then blue, then rage-filled eyes of my ancestors, and, well you get the idea, I managed a smile and a nod and said something like \"Yeah, I guess so.\"  Anyway, I finished my smoke, lit another, and when the other kitchen guy got there (old-timer who absolutely ran that place but had recently been threatening to quit over the same GM), I asked if he could handle it on his own that shift; when he said sure, I gave him my apron and told him to tell GM that I was gonna be shorter on my notice than I was on pies the night before.\n\nFound out old-timer quit later that day after GM lost it on him during that shift.  We got together and went back for dinner one night when the franchise owner (who liked both of us) was around, and we both got a kick out of GM having to smile and serve us as we talked about our new plans with the owner.  No idea what happened to any of those guys after I left town, but I do sometimes miss throwing dough still.",

It was surprisingly common how often managers, from lower level up to the very top tier of management, make bad decisions on employees without thinking of the outcome.    I think I did a pretty good job of avoiding that but saw it happening around me.\n\nI've seen situations like OP's where they are screwing a great employee with a bad review, impossible task, or terrible pay.   I've seen them fire key employees as part of cost cutting layoffs without the slightest hint of planning for someone else to take over their duties.  \n\nOnce, over my strong objections, the top tier of management fired one of my key employees out from under me and it eventually was the reason I left the company.  Weeks later I got into a big argument with that executive and they told me that they needed to get rid of someone and wasn't I glad it wasn't me.  I asked them if they had the slightest idea what the two of us did day to day before they decided one of use had to go - and got met with silence and a blank stare.  \n\nWhen I left I recommend a great fellow employee to get promoted to my position but they passed him over without any serious consideration.   Well, all things work out.  My replacement screwed up stuff and was underperforming until he left the company a year or two later.  The employee I recommended left for a better position and a dozen years later he's worked his way up to be president of a major player in the industry.

I somehow managed to impress the founder during my 3 month internship and was offered a longer term position. By the time I was there 6 months, only the founder, one of the guys from marketing, and one of the parttime managers had been there longer than me. The rest all left or had their contracts discontinued.\n\nThe founder, who is a tenured professor of economics who teaches at a university and sits on multiple boards of directors for major corporations, was losing her mind at why nothing was getting done, and blamed me for not being able to design a robot arm when I had no previous experience with industrial design and when I was hired to write software as an intern. She did get a lot of funding and government subsidies, though, and they're still out there 2 years later publishing marketing material and giving keynote speeches.",

The drawer was used by 7 people that day, and everyone got write ups.\n\nI was well liked, so I threw my weight around a bit and said \"sorry I don't sign write ups\", and they said cool and both managers signed it stating I received but didn't sign. They were a little annoyed but didn't argue.\n\nI asked later (informally) and was told that they are required to write up everyone that uses a drawer when they suspect theft. It's a paper trail, and they eventually narrowed it down and fired the person stealing.\n\nI avoided any more write ups because management would \"forget\" to do the paperwork for minor things like being late a few minutes. But if there was a bad employee you better believe they would get write ups for every small thing to eventually push them out. I guess what I'm saying is I am agreeing thst write ups are really there for them to get ready to fire you. Unless you are really screwing up.",

I agree, the kids are still young, and I do not believe in hiring a babysitter. (I had one as a child, my experience was not good.) \n\nSo, I stay home with the kids, let her go to work.\n\nAfter 2 years, she's tired of working. Ok fine, no problem. I clean up my resume and go job hunting. \n\nThe very first recruiter I find, looks at my resume, looks at me and says, \"What's this 2-year gap?\" (I have about 15 years of work experience in various fields altogether.)\n\nI explain, \"That's when my wife wanted to work, so I stayed home with the kids.\" Equality, right? Nope, fuck me. lol\n\nThis recruiter, I shit you not. Looks at me and says, \"Well damn, looks like you gotta start all over again.\"\n\nI say, WTF do you mean, start all over again?\n\nHe proceeds to tell me that he will only be able to find me entry level jobs because of that 2-year work gap. \n\nI told him he could kiss the gap between my thighs and left. lol",

We\u2019re debt free, I have good income and healthcare. But he likes his job and the people he actually works with (c-level management has been causing serious moral issues for the last year). \n\nInstead he said ok, if I have to take all my annual leave before getting to start FMLA I\u2019m going to make sure the FMLA I take is worth it and not just a week. So maximum FMLA time he can have according to corporate policy is 26 weeks. He put in for his annual leave and then for ALL 26 weeks of FMLA and said see ya in August \ud83e\udd23 \n\nSo far he\u2019s gotten 10 calls from corporate since getting home this evening and sent everyone of them to voicemail.

Increase time came and I got 5%. It was R500 which was about $46 dollars at the time. That added no value to my life. Had I left like my 2 colleagues I\u2019d have gotten around 8-10% Increase in my new salary as that\u2019s the norm to negotiate and then come their increase time I\u2019d have gotten around 5% as that\u2019s the norm. So that would have been closer to R2000 increase. Which would be $184 at the time. I couldn\u2019t believe it. What a slap in the face. Two years no increase and I got shit? After being promised they\u2019d take those two years increases we should have gotten into consideration? I started looking for a job, my ex employer wanted me back with them and offered a 40% increase. My then manager took that to Exco and showed them that because they did not stick to their word I was poached by a competitor who is a small company and they offered me 40% more because they know my worth. They didn\u2019t even though I was loyal and brought in thousands to millions. They tried to counter offer but I declined because my colleagues still only got 5%. My departure sent them into overdrive and reevaluated my colleagues salaries as they didn\u2019t want to lose more people. We brought in a lot of money hence why they bought our company over. Then they treated us like dirt. Fast forward a few years later they were embroiled in corruption and found to have been part of state capture in South Africa. All my colleagues who stayed lost their jobs. The former owner had passed away and at least didn\u2019t see her company she built up be shredded because of their criminal actions.",

I did a lot of paperwork for the management and knew how to do all the jobs in my department. I gave my 2 weeks notice for after the holidays but they continued to treat me like shit so I ended up quitting 3 days after my notice. The department I was in fell apart. Three other people ended up quitting including the manager. Quitting and knowing that all hell will break loose is the greatest feeling.",

It's super easy to understand that when you disrespect one of your star employees that they are not going to want to work for you any more.  It's not about money at that point.  It's about the slap in the face they just received after going above and beyond for the company for years to ensure it's success.",

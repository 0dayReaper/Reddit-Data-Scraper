    "postText": "Yesterday I was walking up to my local grocery store and a lady power-walks herself to the door. She acted like she didn\u2019t see me, which was impossible. She almost ran me over. Then she calls out to her daughter to hurry up. I stopped and let the daughter go in front of me. \n\nThe deli area makes all sorts of yummy sandwiches to-order. You just have to fill out a little card with your order and they will make it for you immediately or while you finish grocery shopping. \n\nSo I walk over to the deli and see a couple standing there. The deli lady is making their food. No worries. I\u2019m not in a hurry. I walk over to the little counter and fill out my card and hand it to another lady who popped over to help. \n\nNow the same chic who tried to run me over at the entrance is standing in front of the deli windows looking at the meats and cheeses. She tells the ladies that she was there before me, and she didn\u2019t know about filling out the cards. This, of course, is 100% not the truth. So I step up and say \u201cNo ma\u2019am. I was here first.\u201d One lady starts making my sandwich and the chic reiterates that she was there first and should be served before first. (BTW she still hasn\u2019t finished filling out her order card.)  Her daughter is staring straight at me. So I look in her eyes staring back. I hold her gaze for several uncomfortable moments and then I say Hello. She stops staring and turns to her mother. Then Mom starts talking about how famished she is so the deli ladies give her a piece of bread.\n\nJust because I could (since I had time) I added a few items to my sandwich (a little Mayo, extra red onions). At this point the deli lady is laughing at me because she knows what I\u2019m doing. At the end, I asked if it could be toasted on the Panini press. The deli lady starts laughing out loud. I just smiled and looked at mom and daughter. She was so angry, but there was really nothing she could do.\n\nI grabbed a blueberry muffin from the bakery and headed to check out. I can\u2019t lie\u2026 I was really hoping the mom and daughter would be in line. Alas, they were still at the deli counter waiting on sandwiches. I actually giggled to myself. \n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I had all kinds of time yesterday to be petty.  \n\nPS: posting here because I was told this wasn\u2019t appropriate for the AITA sub-Reddit. That\u2019s fine, I know I was being the A. \n\nPPS: This a small grocery store where you recognize most of the employees and they recognize you. It was not a Subway-type restaurant.",

I've slowed my pace in making orders. I've gone in the freezer to look for a product that obviously was not available. I've even in great detail given information requested. My reasoning: if someone thinks they are better than others and treats others like crap, me included at times, then you can wait! And if you don't want to wait... GO ELSEWHERE!! \n\nI've become friends with many of those I assisted. Surprisingly, there are even some on the receiving end of petty revenge that realized what they did was wrong and became a friend as well.",

She looked at me like why?\n\nSo I was at the checkout and they were really busy, I got in the queue and she tried to get into another queue next to mine but was told that the were closing that lane...  she looked around and seeing so many people in all the queues and she just pushed her cart to the side and leaves in a huff...

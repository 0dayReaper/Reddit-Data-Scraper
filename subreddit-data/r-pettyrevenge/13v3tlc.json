    "postText": "So I\u2019ll start this by mentioning at the time of this story I was 20 years old, and I\u2019m 21 now, which ends up being pretty crucial to the story. When I was 18 I got my first job at my local Subway sandwich shop and quickly learned how awful fast food jobs are. When I started, we had a pretty small team of around 10 people total including myself. My General manager who I\u2019ll call GM and my District manager, who will be DM were two completely different people. My GM quickly became my friend and the DM became someone who I wanted to look up to until she started showing her true colors. \n\nSo I ended up working this job for about two years, becoming a shift lead at one point. For those of you who know, most subways range from shift lead, to GM, to DM. I didn\u2019t stay shift lead for long, but since I worked both days and nights, I knew this job inside and out. I was one of the 5ish people who knew every task and job there was, other than just making food. \n\nSince I knew every job, I was expected to come in and pretty much anytime. At the same time I had just started college and Covid was at its peak in the US where I live. The stress of college and work was getting to all of us, not to mention the thought of getting sick. The first issue I had, among many, was the first time I got the Covid-19 booster, I became super sick like many others did at the time. I was still expected to come to work and got so dizzy from running around that I almost passed out. \n\nOnce I got better, I was expected to come in all the time, sometimes going from closing one night, working an 8 hour shift and opening the next morning, meaning my sleep suffered as well. It eventually got to the point where I had to step down from shift lead to focus on myself, which the DM did not like. To give more context about the DM, she would complain jobs weren\u2019t being done on the shift I happened to be on pretty much ever week. There was always something for her, that most of the time turned out to be a plain lie. This DM also had a favorite saying \u201cI can do this job by myself, and you\u2019re all replaceable.\u201d This is when the petty revenge comes into play.\n\nAfter enough of the rude remarks from the corporate and customers. I said I would need to take some time off for a few days to focus on my mental health. I brought this up to my GM, who was perfectly fine with it since it was 2 weeks in advance( standard requesting time off practice) by my DM wouldn\u2019t accept it. She claimed that \u201cit\u2019s too short notice,\u201d and \u201cwe need you for truck those days. Btw none of those days were when our truck comes which was on Thursday\u2019s. I finally had enough and said if she wouldn\u2019t accept I needed time off, I would be forced to put in my two weeks notice and quit. She gave me the same \u201cyou\u2019re replaceable,\u201d bullshit and I decided I was done. I waited for a Friday, our busiest day, and noticed that the other people scheduled for our shift consisted of one other person who knew how to do most jobs accept close the safe (which I could do) and two minors who couldn\u2019t even work the oven by themselves. Fine, you wanna say I\u2019m replaceable? You can find someone else. I purposely turned my phone on silent and blocked their numbers, refusing to even answer them. I know this makes me the asshole for screwing them over, but if she said she could run the store all by herself, she could come in on a day she wasn\u2019t scheduled and drive almost an hour to come in and take my spot. After not coming in, I learned she had to come in and fix everything, which serves her right. Screw you DM, you can do all that by yourself for all I care. \n\nI guess my main message for those who read this far is please by nice and mindful to your fast food workers. They\u2019re overworked and stressed enough as it is. So think of how you want to be treated and show some kindness next time you order fast food.",

The extra money is great but when it comes down to you working yourself to exhaustion by picking up a shift and getting some much needed rest, you need to pick yourself and remind them that if you keep going that you\u2019re  not going to be any good for them or for yourself outside of work.",

Idk if it\u2019s like that everywhere, and I guess I could theoretically be wrong as I haven\u2019t specifically looked up the statutes that say so. But that\u2019s been the general consensus everywhere I\u2019ve worked. Never stopped them from scheduling me 40 hours as a high school student and fixing my hours so that I got my time and kept them from seeming as though I worked past the allowed curfew for minors. I also did several open- closes but as I said, we never did clopens thankfully. This was at a Wendy\u2019s near me, about 10 years ago. Things could certainly have changed. Currently I work 12 hours shifts in a factory, and we aren\u2019t allowed to work more than 12 hours in one day. So no being asked to come in early or stay late. I can only work optional over time on the nights I\u2019m not scheduled. No mandatory",

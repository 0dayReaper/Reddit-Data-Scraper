    "postText": "I've been waiting for this to come up in my memories so I could get the wording right...\nBack in 2020 when we were finally allowed to get out and go to the stores again, I was on my way down a back country road headed to the store. As I was driving, I must have gotten distracted and got a little too close to the redneck truck in front of me because as he turned into his driveway, he and his passengers flipped me off and yelled curse words out the window at me. So while I was at the store, I picked out the prettiest blank card I could find and wrote the following message inside...\n\"I would like to apologize if I got too close to your truck earlier today. You see, I've had a really crappy day and my mind honestly wasn't completely focused on my driving. While I feel your (over)reaction of flipping me off and cussing me out was a bit much, I can see how you may have felt threatened by my minivan. Also for the record, I just bought it, and I'll admit it does get away from me sometimes. It's just such a smooth ride- I'm sure you can appreciate that! So anyway, I sincerely hope you can accept my apology. And I'm sure you feel better anyway, because flipping off and cursing a mom in her minivan with her two young, impressionable boys in the back was the best way to make everything better. \nSincerely,\nThe mom in the minivan that was on her way to the testing site. \n\nP.S. I coughed all over this card.\"\n\nI threw the card out the window into their driveway when I drove home. I wasn't on my way to testing, and I didn't cough on the card, but it sure made me feel better. \n\n(And I know they got the card because one of them was in the driveway when I threw it)",

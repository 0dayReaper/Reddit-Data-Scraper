    "postText": " Apparently AITA has a 3k word limit... I don't feel like cutting half of what I wrote, so here we are.  Bonus points if someone recognizes me, and can name the city/main act at the event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello,\n\nI'm happy to accept an Asshole judgment, just genuinely curious. I'm also posting under my main account.. wonder if anyone recognizes me!\n\nYears ago, I was at an undisclosed conference for work. At these events, meals are always provided. A potentially contributing factor, is that breakfast was incredibly bare bones; I'm talking all visual, and a no mass kind of breakfast... To make it worse, lunch as about three hours late. Thousands of hungry people, and hot weather aren't always a great combination..\n\nSide note: Please don't accept this as an excuse for my behavior, I'm just trying to set the scene.. People were beginning to get a bit beyond frustrated.\n\nFinally, the announcement was made that lunch was being served, and instructions were given, to line up to be served at the three buffet tables. Yes, a few thousand people, lining up at three buffet tables. My coworkers/colleagues opted to hang back until the long lines subsided, but I was very hungry, and chose not to wait.\n\nThere I was, in line with roughly a hundred or so people in front of me. This is when a handful of people grouped up beside the line nearly immediately in front of me, and were having a conversation. This caught my attention, because the line behind me was growing by the second, and I just knew they that once they noticed, they were going to try to cut in front of me and the other properly queued people.\n\nMy assumptions were quickly realized, when they began to look at the length of the line, and collectively/wordlessly merged with the line. They jumped in about 2-3 people in front of me, and one of them even made sustained eye contact with one of me while doing so... It was incredulous. I gave the guy a \"you serious bruh?\" expression, and he shrugged his shoulders at me.. I mean the nerve.. I can remember looking around me, to my other properly queued allies, but I received nothing more than an acknowledging frown. It was obviously up to me..\n\nI began \"You guys can't be serious.. The back of the line is back there.\" followed by me pointing over my shoulder with my thumb. A bit clich\u00e9, I admit it, but please don't judge me on being predicable. They all turned to face me, and the girl of the group said. \"Are you serious.\" before looking me up and down and scoffing.. As if I had \"the nerve\" to question \"Them\". Them being the attractive group of people, who were obviously involved in \"Sales\"... You know.. The spoiled lot in the business world.. the \"entitled children\", if you will....\n\nI stood firm, however. I wasn't about to let this wrong be ignored, and allow this group of \"Sales People\" get away with their horrific transgression. This wasn't middle school, this was a business \"Conference\". A place of dignity, and class. A place where one represented their company with a certain composure. (I later learned that this was not true in the least, however it was my first year, and I had yet to witness the \"event\" night, and the drunken escapades of people getting what was essentially a hall pass from their children... aka drunken, out of control 30-60 year old's).\n\nSo, there I was being stared down by a handful of the \"upper\" class of the business world, the \"Sales Team\". They giggled at me; My incredulousness amused them, and they weren't taking me seriously. I persevered in the face of their utter bullshit. \"This isn't a joke, and you aren't children. Get in the back of the line, and stop acting like you're entitled to jumping in line. What you're doing is absolutely pathetic, and I can't believe I have to speak up... Get moving.\"\n\nOne of the guys meekly said something along the lines of \"Well, you're the only one that seems to have a problem.\" I scoffed.. I genuinely did.. What a fucking statement.. I mean really... Who wouldn't have a problem with it.. I mean.. I may have been the one that spoke up, but obviously, the others in line took issue with what they were doing.\n\nI smiled, and looked around me.... \"Ok then.. who else thinks they're a bunch of assholes?\" Silence... utter silence.. The other people in line.. The very people whose queuing rights, and dignity I had spoken on behalf of, were averting their eyes from me.. Like cowering dogs they chose to not support me, despite how I had supported them... The betrayal I felt in that moment was indescribable....\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole.. My speech had gotten the group of attractive sales people to begin to withdrawal themselves reluctantly from the line. I had won, but to say it was a bitter sweet victory would be the understatement of the century.... See, one of the things I can't stand more than people cutting in line, is a group of people not standing up for themselves, especially if they weren't the first to speak out. I'd laid the ground work.. I had their backs, and they couldn't so much as look me in the eyes; They all ignored me as if they were afraid of me. :( The very people whom I was trying to protect.\n\nSo, I lost it a tad. I said something like, \"Oh.. wait.. Hold on a second... Apparently I'm in the wrong, and you guys are right... I'm soooo sorry.. See.. here I thought that cutting in line was wrong, but as seeing as me, the only person out of the hundreds in line have taken an issue with it, I must be in the wrong.. You guys are obviously in the right, my bad.. I'm soooo sorry. No.. no no no no.. Don't get out of line.. Where are you going.. No no no.. You guys belong in front of us..\"\n\nOne of the Sales guys said.. \"Well.. Why don't you get in front of us.\", and I replied.. \"Oh, no.. Wouldn't dream of it.. That would make me a hypocrite.. I'm not cutting in front of the people between us. You guys enjoy your place. Enjoy you're place in line despite the people that had lined up five our so minutes before you.. You earned it..\"\n\nSo, I didn't hear a word from the other people I was in line with. I also made sure to emphasize that I hoped the \"Sales People\" enjoyed their meal, as they were collecting it from the buffet. I may have sarcastically apologized as the last one of the group walked off as well.\n\nSo reddit, how do you judge me? :) AITA?",

For me there\u2019s a time and a place to be a line warrior but a professional setting isn\u2019t one of them\u2026any other setting I would be right there with you backing you up but at a professional conference? Nope\u2026keeping my head down all the way.\n\nI have been known to do it though! Back when I was in my late teens me and my family were queuing to get into the Vatican. They had signs periodically to tell you how long the wait was from certain points. I think we\u2019d already been queuing for about 45 mins and still had another 40 or so mins to go. \n\nA couple casually walked up to the edge of queue feigning interest in the buildings or whatever and slowly inserted themselves into the queue a few people ahead of us. And no one said anything. I was furious! How dare they?! So I walked up to them, tapped the woman on the shoulder and told her where the queue started. She may not have spoken English, not sure, but she didn\u2019t move. I gesticulated and pointed to the back of the queue and locked eyes with her. She moved. I won \ud83d\ude4c",

The guide was fine but it\u2019s just so rammed inside it meant not really seeing anything with any great depth. I went over 10years ago and it was wonderful seeing all the famous artwork, this time took my kids and I think I have put them off ever going again!\n\nIt felt like with we were just herded through. The coliseum was also very busy but nothing on the Vatican, at least we could stop and enjoy each part.\n\nEdit to add maybe it\u2019s something to do with it being the week after Easter \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I said you'd keep quiet when someone else did.  That goes with your \"don\u2019t like confrontation\" mentality and your \"where I have to stay with said group for an extended period of time\".\n\nAlso a side note, still replying after a \"have a great night\" sign off usually nullifies an attempt to be a \"bigger man\", since that shows one wants to have the last word in.",

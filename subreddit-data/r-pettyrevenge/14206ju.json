    "postText": "*Disclaimer: This is light hearted and fun, so hopefully it helps cheer someone up on a bad day. This happened almost 20 years ago but another post reminded me of it, feel free to point and laugh at mistakes.*\n\nJust to start off, I got along great with this teacher in question Mr O. He was awesome but also a smartass, unfortunately so am I. One day after handing in a book report, the grade I got back was less than I thought it should be as I put a lot of work into it. When I asked Mr O about it, he replied something along the lines of \"it wasn't up to your usual standards\", so he knocked some points off. I still passed it, but it bugged me. I get now he was trying to push me to do my best, but it irked me.\n\nThen SACE time came, and for our English exam we had one hour to submit a 250 word exam on the teacher's choice of subject. Mr O was and always had been a huge superhero comics fan, so he tasked us to write an exam on what would happen if we suddenly developed superpowers. He then looked at me and said something to the effect of \"I expect great things from you all, get going\".\n\nMost of the other people in the class wrote the standard sort of fare, but I decided to cheat Mr O out of the story he wanted. I knew he was looking forward to my story as he had come to enjoy the extra creative flair I always used to put in for an epic story. Instead, I wrote a story about being a balding, 40 year old mechanic who one day accidentally kept starting fires. I made this the most compelling and funny story I had ever written and was the first to hand it in. When the results came back, he conceded it was one of the funniest things he had read and had even shown the other teachers, who pressured him into giving me extra credit for it.\n\n(For those not in South Australia, SACE is basically the culmination of high schooling here. It's basically two weeks of exams before graduation.)\n\nTLDR: Teacher knocked points off of one assignment but gave them back on a better one I did later.",

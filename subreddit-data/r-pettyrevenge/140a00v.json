    "postText": "My wife and I co-own a stone countertop shop. She runs day to day operations, is the face of the company, and while I work a full time job but will do paperwork &amp; IT on the weekends. I\u2019ll also come in, as needed, to be an extra pair of hands. \n\nI need to mention our looks, because it\u2019s relevant. I\u2019m not a 10. I\u2019m an early 40s, bald, dad-bod type. I\u2019ve aged like milk. My wife, on the other hand, has aged like wine. Between a love of fashion and fitness, she is a beautiful woman. We joke that our business does so well because she\u2019s \u201ccontractor bait.\u201d\n\nThis past Thursday there was a load of new show room material being delivered. I had scheduled to be at the shop to help unload the new, move out the old, and do a deep clean. \n\nAround 3:30 PM, a contractor came in to drop off a check, and then discuss a new project. He\u2019s chatting up my wife, being friendly, etc. I\u2019m just hired help to him, but I notice the way he stares at her ass as she walks around, and then he blatantly looks down her shirt when she\u2019s at the front desk writing up paperwork. I just shake my head. He\u2019s there for 20 minutes or so, and leaves. \n\nAbout the same time I finish cleaning up and go to head home. She has to run payroll for Friday and then make a bank run, so we go our separate ways. \n\nSince I have time to kill, I hit the local bar for a beer before driving home. Guess who is there? The contractor. I sit near him because most seats are taken, and he notices my company shirt. He chats me up. \n\nPretty quickly he mentions my wife. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can work for her. I\u2019d be harder than those countertops seeing her walk around all day!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess she\u2019s pretty cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretty cute? That\u2019s the type of woman that could drain my bank account and it would be worth every penny!\u201d\n\nIt goes like this for a bit, when he asks if I know what she likes to drink. I say I\u2019m not sure, but when we do happy hours she usually gets a vodka soda or something like that. \n\nMy wife hates vodka. She loves gin. \n\nSo imagine my surprise when she comes home from the shop the next day with a handle of Tito\u2019s vodka from a friendly contractor! Apparently she did a \u201cgreat job\u201d on the last project, and he wanted to say thanks. \n\nI\u2019m typing this post on Sunday morning enjoying a Bloody Mary with that man\u2019s generous vodka gift.\n\nEDIT: Told my wife the story and shared this post. She\u2019s dying. She always felt he a touch creepy. Happy to hear he helped me have a good Sunday.",

I designed the office space with the specialty designer, I did the interior decorating, I oversaw the construction, and then I managed the office for 10 years before we retired again. \n\nWe were equal partners in everything throughout our marriage. He fell down in a way that was catastrophic and I could not do anything but be by his side every day as long as the hospital staff would let me stay. He died a couple of months later and that was the absolute worst day of my life and I had already buried my parents, one grandmother,  aunts and uncles and my husband 's parents.\n\nA partnership between soulmates is a special relationship and trust is the key that makes it work.",

Then one day I met up with a friend for a double date\u2026\u2026 sparks flew\u2026.. problem was\u2026 the moment I met his date, I knew she was the lady for me. She had 3 kids from her previous marriage and my friend did not like that and the kids hated him. Being a guy who had been cheated on, I only would be friends with his date\u2026. Very soon ex\u2026. We all scuba dived and he would swim off without her\u2026 she was a beginner and I would keep close to get as such. I dated a few other ladies, but couldn\u2019t continue to see anyone else\u2026.. I would always find an excuse as to Why I would no longer see anyone. One day my friend suggested I ask out his Ex\u2026. As the kids loved me and I really liked the kids. I refused as I didn\u2019t want to dishonor our friendship\u2026.. he said I wouldn\u2019t be since he told me I should ask her out. Tomorrow is our 21st anniversary of being married, I always refer to her as my beautiful bride. And as far as trust her\u2026.. with all that I am I trust her\u2026. She works with lots of men in uniform\u2026. I trust her\u2026. And the kids\u2026. They still love me\u2026. I am the one who makes thier mother the happiest and the oldest has said \u201cshe wants to find a man who looks at her, like I always look at her Mother\u201d as far as thier biological father, they all decided to cut off contact with him when they were teenagers as he is a super toxic POS\u2026.

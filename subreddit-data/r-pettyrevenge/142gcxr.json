It dawned on me how nasty porta pottys are. So, naturally taking into consideration how crappy these people have made my fiends life I decided to take matters into my own hands. I had stickers made up and put their phone numbers on them so people can complain about the condition of these porta pottys. \n\nEvery porta potty I come across gets one. I also happen to work in a field that requires the regular use of these. Needless to say I come across many porta pottys and now they will too \ud83d\ude1c",

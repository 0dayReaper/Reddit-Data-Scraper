    "postText": "I had this friend who I met online. We were friends on Discord and I previously knew that he was quite homophobic and transphobic. I came out to him about being agender and he was fine with it. Recently, I told him my pronouns were they/she and he went off on me. I\u2019m biologically male, so apparently this was an issue with him that I wasn\u2019t sticking to my biological gender. We got in a very long argument, involving him telling me \u201cYou\u2019re not a fucking girl\u201d and calling me the n-word. He then started telling me to send him a pic of my female genitalia (which I don\u2019t have). I ended up just telling him to block me, and he did. \n\nImmediately after the argument, I went to the server where all his friends (they\u2019re also my friends) were. I made a private thread where I shared screenshots of the whole exchange and people were pissed. I got him permanently banned which cut off his contact with all his friends. I also reported some of his messages to Discord. Just a few minutes ago, he messaged me on a different social media site where he said that he couldn\u2019t trust me anymore because I got him banned. I simply responded with a gif and then told him to not be homophobic next time.",

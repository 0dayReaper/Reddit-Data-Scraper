    "postText": "I\u2019m not really sure if this counts as petty revenge so let me know if it doesn\u2019t!\n\nSo I\u2019m about to graduate high school - literally have less than ten school days left - and, as a senior, I have officially stopped caring what people think about my clothes. \n\nThis means I\u2019ve been wearing a lot of anime shirts. I\u2019ve always liked anime but I kinda kept it to myself during my junior year. Now I realize if someone cares enough about my interest in anime to make fun of me for it, they\u2019re the loser.\n\nThese past few weeks, whenever I wear an anime shirt, the same guy stops me in the hallway and says, \u201cI bet you didn\u2019t even watch that show.\u201d\n\nFirst it was Full Metal Alchemist, then it was Death Note, and last week it was Jojo\u2019s Bizzare Adventure.\n\nHe does the stereotypical shit like quizzing me on basic plot points, grilling me on my favorite characters (then judging them), and then leaving the conversation like he proved a point.\n\nI was just kinda ignoring him - I found it really funny, actually - but then he was quizzing me so hard about Jojo and judging my opinions about everything.\n\nMy favorites are:\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your favorite Jojo?\u201d\n\u201cJosuke, probably.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not even a real Joestar!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you watch part one and two?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I like them a lot.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s lame. They\u2019re not even important to the plot.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like Jolyne?\u201d\n\u201cLove her.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t agree with having a female Jojo.\u201d\n\nNow, you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cOP, just walk away.\u201d\n\nWish I could!\n\nI\u2019m not saying this to shame but this guy is massive, both in height and weight, and I am quite tiny, so walking past him when he\u2019s blocking my way is kind of not easy.\n\nAfter the Jojo debacle, I decided to have some fun. \n\nI like making my own anime shirts because merch can get expensive, so I gave my cousin a ring. He\u2019s an artist and has that anime-esque style, so he gave me permission to put one of his artworks on a shirt and wear it to school.\n\nI get through third period without seeing him, then he sneak attacks me on my way to P.E.\n\n\u201cYou really should stop wearing these shirts. You\u2019re such a poser.\u201d\n\nUsually, I let him talk, quiz me, then walk away with a new story for my friends, but I decided to be petty. \n\n\u201cOh, but I love this anime! Do you watch it?\u201d\n\nMe looks visibly caught off guard, then he starts stammering, \u201cOf course I do!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Who\u2019s your favorite character? Favorite season? Favorite opening?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just rapid-firing every stupid question he\u2019s asked me over the past few weeks, getting way too much satisfaction from how flustered he\u2019s getting with every question.\n\nEventually he just walks away. Doesn\u2019t say a single thing to me, just leaves. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen him since and I can wear my anime shirts in peace.",

I had no idea what any of the members looked like at that time and when I was confused how those two things were related , another friend pointed out that that was the lead . To be fair though , I rarely ever look up what band members look like or watch music videos because I prefer to listen to music while I do other things .

            "comment": "Way back in 1994 my freshman year of high school I started wearing punk rock t-shirts because I, like almost everyone else of my generation, had just gotten into punk. Had some gatekeepy popular kid do this shit to me. He was a guy who looked like Doyle from the Misfits only 14 and 5\u20195\u201d. That\u2019s to say he was ripped and intimidating and I was just some scrawny 13yo (skipped some grades).\n\nFirst day I wore a Green Day shirt from the Kerplunk album he lost his shit on me. \u201cFuckin\u2019 poser! You\u2019re not allowed to wear that shit! You didn\u2019t even hear about them till MTV.\u201d Bro we live in Missouri. 99.9% of people didn\u2019t hear about them till MTV. I just let him throw me against a locker and yell at me about my shirt for awhile. I didn\u2019t want to get in a fight (that I would lose) my third day of high school.\n\nThe thing was, I am autistic. At the time, I just thought I was super nerdy about certain things way too hard. Now I know those things are called special interests. Punk had been my special interest all summer. He was not fucking prepared. I was.\n\nNow, the local school coolest person (that everyone of course thought was a weirdo loser) was a senior and we\u2019d made friends. Dude looked like Marylin Manson before that was even a thing. Except he was 6\u20197\u201d. He saw this whole interaction and walked up to me and was like \u201chey don\u2019t let that shitty fuck give you any shit. you like what you like. enjoy it and if he touches you again i\u2019ll make sure he fucking regrets it.\u201d\n\nSo I took that information and spent the next couple weeks thinking. I noticed the douche guy\u2019s shirts. Misfits (of course), Ramones, Minor Threat, Dead Kennedys, and this one I hadn\u2019t heard of called Skrewdriver. Now, I had to learn about this new one, special interest and all, and I discovered they were literally Nazis. So after I found this out I put my trusty Green Day shirt for the next school day. Sure enough, guy walks up and is like \u201cHey f****t, I thought I told you to stop wearing that.\u201d I saw my friend Lurch Manson start moving down the hall towards us.\n\n\u201cHate gay people huh, Black people too?\u201d I ask. The one Black dude in our whole school had his locker next to mine and was standing there. His attention perked up but that wasn\u2019t my intent, it did work to my advantage though. \u201cInteresting a guy who listens to a band that wrote Nazi Punks Fuck Off also wears the merch of Nazi bands. Your rich parents buy all that for you, housepunk?\u201d\n\nNow if you don\u2019t know, in early punk subculture \u201chousepunk\u201d was one of the worst things you could be called. It meant you, unlike most of the bands and fans of the bands you listen to, grew up with money in the suburbs and were by default a poser. In the space of a few seconds I\u2019d called him a Nazi rich kid poser. He was balling up his fists and I was preparing for a serious punch that was gonna ruin my whole day, knowing the aftermath would be worth it.\n\nInstead, he stopped and said \u201cwhat Nazi merch, f****t?\u201d I said \u201cScrewdriver, preppy.\u201d He was literally shaking with rage, and right then my tall senior friend stopped walking about five feet behind him.\n\nMy locker buddy over my shoulder is like \u201cwhite power music? shit even I know that band is full of nazis.\u201d Dude went from angry to embarrassed back to angry again, but then looked around. Realized he was facing two freshman on one side, and a gigantic senior on the other. He mumbled \u201cwell at least I\u2019m not a f****t\u201d and power walked away.\n\nWord got out around the school he was a Nazi. Everyone but the rednecks basically cold shouldered him. Rumor also got out he was afraid to fight me, which combined with his love of punk music made the rednecks laugh at him. He went from popular to the kid eating lunch alone angry in the corner inside a week.\n\nEventually he did decide to fight me in gym class, but that was when I found out that despite his epic looking physique he\u2019d never been in a fight with someone who knew how to take and throw a punch. I won\u2019t say I won that fight because I did come out of it worse for wear, but he didn\u2019t come out of it any better and he got suspended for starting it. After that his parents sent him to military school. I guess he\u2019d also been caught with drugs at home and was being a dick to his retired army dad.\n\nI still wonder about him and feel a little guilty about how our little confrontation ended up for him. Truthfully, I was jealous of him (and as a queer person, a bit of a crush even still) until he went to military school. Dude was hot, had good taste in music minus the Nazi bands, interesting style, and unlike me: money. We could have been friends.\n\nTL;DR: Gatekeeping is stupid. High school social structure is fucking poison.",

And now you waltz in, wearing this passion literally on your sleeve, and he's probably feeling a rush of conflicting emotions, e.g. \"OP shares his passion! Not so alone!  OP has more guts than I have had so far! OP could or could have been a potential friend or colleague to share interest with?  Anime should just be for outcasts like me\" etc.\n\nThe sad bit is that they're not able to work this out, express it, get past their own insecurities, and be nice to you about it, so it's all coming out as insecure, challenging and passive aggressive behaviour.

I have a lot of experience dealing with a variety of people with a variety of problems. I am a very compassionate person, I had to be to work in the field I worked in for many years.\n\n\nI never said he enjoyed being a jerk, I said he sounds like he doesn't know how to interact with others which is not uncommon with teenagers, especially those with limited social experience/teaching. \n\n\nI took what the OP was saying as the info available to us and with the OP's reply to you was given additional info. However you forget the OP is also a teenager and basically still a child. It is neither their responsibility or duty to help this person who does not know how to talk to others kindly. To double down on your statement is  rude to the OP and their feelings.\n\nIs this kid that harassed OP in need of assistance, sure. Someone should sit them down and explain how what they did was not ok. But that is not the responsibility for one teenager to do for another. Mind you a teenager who probably has their own emotional/mental growing to do. Op was kind to a point. Answered this guy's questions, at least from what we are told, honestly and he continued to be rude. OP, from the sounds of it, merely showed him how it felt to be talked to the way he talked to her. I'm happy OP had the guts to stand up to this guy. That is sometimes the hardest thing to do.\n\nIt's ok to feel compassion. The world needs more of it. But sometimes people need to see things the hard way to learn. Feel compassion, just make sure it's not misplaced.",

She went to one concert and decided she was better than the rest of us, always talking over us about our favorite bands and saying she found them first etc. Eventually I found out she was talking to my crush behind my back and telling him I didn't really listen to the bands I claimed I did, which was one way I could always get him to talk to me (and also not true). \n\nMy other friends and I made up a fake band and even made tshirts from a fake show we all pretended to have gone to together. We all wore them to school on the same day and of COURSE she lied and said she knew of the band and had found them a long time ago. It was wonderful to watch her face and hear her blatantly lie while we gushed about how great the show was.",

Season 3 has a bunch of villains that are quite literally non essential. Every episode is a new villain and they literally just pop up. JoJo defeats them and the next episode is the same thing I guess they didn\u2019t want JoJo to go straight to the big bad.",

I don\u2019t mind new villains if it adds progression but 80% of them are just there to get in their way and get defeated. They add nothing to the story. Overall story is fairly interesting but in between is boring.",

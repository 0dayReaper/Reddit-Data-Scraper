    "postText": "This was a young woman who only got her job (especially made for her) because her dad was golfing buddies with our CEO. \n\nShe regularly blamed her team for her numerous mistakes, and took all the credit for their hard work. Let's call her Bitch.\n\nI used to do trade shows and after the fall season would be back in the office and create a comprehensive report on the results of the shows, normally 15+ pages. The Veeps always wanted paper reports, not attachments, so I normally printed them out and distributed them personally to the staff. \n\nI handed Bitch her copy as we passed in the corridor, then watched in sheer amazement as she marched straight into the CEO's office and said, I kid you not; \"Here Boss, I just put this together for you\". Stunning, the report was all about trade shows, and she wasn't even in the same department!\n\nCue the revenge, I marched in there right after her, and said \"Oh, Bitch, I just realized that my report has some numerical errors, let me have it back and I'll get you a revised one\", all the while staring at the CEO with a slightly raised eyebrow.\n\nAs I left, I heard the most wonderful words from the CEO: \"Aiku, would you please close the door as you leave?\" \n\nBitch came out about five minutes later looking like a ripe tomato. I couldn't resist asking \"How was your little tete-a-tete with our Boss?\"",

At the time we didn\u2019t have the best security between the various folder accounts so it wasn\u2019t too hard for the cheater to find it on the shared network drive. I don\u2019t recall what happened to the guy but he might\u2019ve dropped out as I don\u2019t recall him graduating. That same year I also caught the older adult night classes cheating on Q&amp;A homework. They weren\u2019t too swift either, had a student name on the turned in work for someone that didn\u2019t exist in the class plus they answered stuff that wasn\u2019t listed to be completed. I did a simple google search and found another professor had posted answers to the book questions for another college in the Midwest and the name was a student there.",

Everyone had their own CVS server, years before DevOps was a thing, and there were actual \"code raids\" that some managers instructed their coders to steal code from other departments. Really confusing, semi-toxic, and so on.  So one manager decided to do \"Open Source\" and by that, he meant, \"all code goes to my team, and I claim credit for it.\"  Seriously, they had scripts to scrub out all comments, change variables (like \"auth\\_token\\_new\" would be changed to \"a\"), and put things in a PHP obfuscator (takes your code and converts it into a non-human readable format. He just decided to become \"king of code.\"\n\nWell, he was giving a demo of some application which he claimed his team built, and I knew that it was code my team did. But he had forgotten to remove some variable labels, so when he was showing off the app, it showed on the bottom of everY form, \"(c)2010 \\[company\\], Development version \\[version\\] - \\[my team\\], contact \\[team group alias\\].\"  It was in a tiny, tiny font but I made sure to point it out in the meeting.\n\n\"No, MY team wrote this!\"\n\n\"Then why does it have our team listed?\"\n\n\"That's the company name. Forgot our company name, already? Ha ha ha...\" \n\nPatronizing git. \n\n\"No, after that. That's our team. That's our application. I can even show you a shortcut to get to FOO through menu BAR.  If you'd asked us, we could have helped with your presentation by showing you how to use it.\"\n\n\"Okay, well, it's OPEN SOURCE, so there is no 'my' program, okay?  Fall asleep in the meeting much?  Remember when we discussed this?\"\n\n\"But you just claimed your team wrote the app, when clearly you didn't.  Open Source means we all work on it. Here, wikipedia defines Open Source as...\"\n\n\"OKAY OKAY OKAY hahaha, great!  You can read something someone else wrote! Good for you!\"\n\nBut the damage was already done. Everyone closed off their CVS servers from his team, and he came across like the crook to pretty much everyone.  Asshat.",

            "comment": "Ooo. Enjoy these academic revenge stories:\n\nWhen I was in college, toward the end some of my classes had these big group projects that were worth a chunk of our grade. In two different classes and with two different people, I ended up outing the slacker. \n\nThe first one was a guy who would swear he did the sides assigned to him for the presentation but would always send me the same encrypted attachment. Like I could see it was the same one every time. And he always waited until almost midnight the day before we were set to present. I would end up scrambling and throwing something together for his slides and then he would just read them for the class. The last time I was so fed up. I\u2019d already talked briefly with the professor about it and how I was basically picking up his slack. I mentioned the class prior that I had something going on and wouldn\u2019t be checking my email past 3pm the day before the presentation so to make sure I had everything before then. I knew he wouldn\u2019t have it in time, even with that much notice. \n\nSure enough, same shitty email came through at the 9th hour. I just pretended I didn\u2019t get the email. He asked for read receipts so I just didn\u2019t open it. I left six slides blank in the presentation with just his name on them. I stayed in the bathroom until right before class started, then rushed into the room and sat down. He\u2019s real nervous and trying to ask if I got his slides and I\u2019m shaking my head no. I told him he was just going to have to remember them or maybe hold them up on his computer for the class to see while he talked about them. He paled. He had his computer with him but we both knew there were no slides on it. We were up second. We\u2019re all nailing the presentation. There are a few questioning glances going on, but everyone just rolls with it. When we get to the blank slides I announce that sometimes things don\u2019t go to plan, but Chad knows the material so he\u2019s going to take over. Chad gets paler. Opens his mouth. Closes it. Walks to his desk, grabs his stuff, walks out of the room. I proceeded to walk through his section without slides and then hand it off to the next person. \n\nSpoke to the professor after class and told her if she\u2019s going to take off points to take them off mine since this was my show and I just refused to continue to be a doormat. No one got marked badly except Chad. I think he dropped the course. \n\nThe second failed group was one where this one girl refused to meet up outside of class. It was a project where we NEEDED to meet up and discuss what we were doing at least a little (no zoom, people). She just point blank refused and said she\u2019s super busy. We were ALL super busy but somehow managed to carve out an hour here and there. But okay. \n\nThen she started not sending anything. She didn\u2019t like the plan we came up with but had zero suggestions. Then she started not coming even to class so we really couldn\u2019t work on it with her. I tried talking to the professor but she said to just try and be understanding that things come up and tough it out. \n\nWe presented in one of the last classes and she was so late she walked in in the middle of it. Just stood there and didn\u2019t even attempt to contribute. I could see that NOW the professor was annoyed, but here we are. \n\nThe final was an actual test. She wasn\u2019t there the day the day/time was announced. At that point, our group project was done. Normally I would have texted her to let her know when x was, but now I\u2019m done with you. She ended up texting one of the guys in the group as we were just getting our tests, asking when the final was. When he said \u201cit started ten minutes ago\u201d I think she almost died. She said she was on her way. \n\nThat day, our normal professor was out, giving her dissertation. We had a random other professor just sitting in the room to collect tests. When I handed mine in to leave I warned her that x person would be showing up really late and very briefly explained the situation and that normal professor was aware. As I\u2019m finishing, she bursts through the door and the professor turned her away and told her to contact her professor regarding a makeup exam. Music to my ears.",

But school group work never represented professional group work well.\n\nYou can loaf off of others in the professional world a lot, as long as it isn\u2019t too bad and you keep up appearances and relationships. \n\nBut in the professional world, there is often consequence for absolute social loafing, where someone does literally nothing. This is the most obnoxious kind of loafing, and it is endemic to school group projects. \n\nThe difference in these situations is incentive of enforcement. \nTo a manager, a worthless deadweight employee is almost always considered intolerable for the business.\nTo a high school teacher, a worthless deadweight student is just an expected burden of the job that they must push forward to the next grade. Thus, they have no utilitarian incentive to enforce standards on absolute loafers.",

One other guy out of 4 was worth anything, and after the first presentation he dropped the class. Then two of the guys who didn't show up to meetings also dropped. For the penultimate presentation, I did all the programming and presentation, and showed off the super outdated documentation that the other worthwhile guy wrote up for the first presentation and that I didn't change. \n\nThen, on the day of the final presentation, the last guy in our group, who had not come to any meetings, had not made changes to the doc, had not contributed to the code, sent me a message on discord letting me know that while he knew that I didn't care about passing this class, he did, and if I wanted to get good feedback from him then I would come to an emergency coding meeting to get the program up to snuff. I let him know that he was delusional, that I had been working on the code every night, and that if he wanted a 2/10 from me instead of a zero, then he could try to update the documentation like he said he would. I had complained to the professor about this guy not doing anything before, and this time I showed him the messages. \n\nI'll give the guy this, he showed up to the presentation with flat nothing, knowing what was coming.  Before we went up I noticed that he had started slapping himself in the face and punching his hand against his other hand into the desk, really weird shit. I showed the program, it went fine I guess, and then I let him show the documentation, and he said nothing for a while until I took over again, and when we went back to our seats he slammed his head into the desk. I got out of that class with a C, because the documentation was a big part of the grade, but the prof knew I was the only person doing anything in a project meant for 5 people, and I graduated. My teammate did not pass. Fuck that guy.",

You can mark how much each participant has contributed.\nWe are assigned one group for the whole semester. It was 3 of us in a group. 2 gals and a guy. For the very first assignment, he attempted some sub par material which I and the other girl brought up to mark and submitted. I gave him 100% coz he had at least attempted something. Then came the second assignment. His contribution was a blank document with headings. I reminded him to finish them, but I could see it wasn't happening. From then on we had 4 more assignment he never got any marks in them.\n\nThe thing is i am usually very mellow and always help out whenever anyone asks for anything in class, take lead in organising notes for fellow classmates. I guess he assumed I would be equally generous with assignment too.",

We used Miro for their presentations and group work because you can go in and see the history to show who worked and when. We told them from day 1 that we would be tracking their group work and there were still a number of very shocked and slightly afraid faces when we would bring it up after their presentations and ask if they had any reason to explain their lack of collaboration then they could email the professor directly. \n\nGroup work sucks.

So they rip you off and you will pay it.\n\nRenting the space in the trade show is very expensive - depending on size and location, from tens of thousands to many hundreds of thousands of pounds/euro/dollars.\n\nThat gets you a rectangle marked on the bare concrete floor, and a power connection.  You can pay thousands extra for an Internet connection.\n\nBuilding the stand is expensive.  You hire a team who design the stand, prefabricate as much as possible, then ship everything to the show, fly the construction team to the show, and build the stand over just a few days to a week.  Some stands are really fancy - separate meeting rooms are common, and two story stands are around.  The crew has to do all the wiring too.\n\nOf course, unloading the truck may have to be done by the venue's union labourers.  And at some venues, stand construction may be partly or completely a union job.  They will be expensive.\n\nYou will ship out a bunch of your products, plus associated equipment to allow you to demo them.\n\nThen you ship out your best salespeople, senior managers, marketing and PR people, and a few engineers to run the stand.  \n\nExhibitions will be central, for each market there might be perhaps one in the US and one in Europe, so you will be travelling internationally.\n\nThe airlines and hotels all know when the show is, and know they will fill up, so will increase their prices.\n\nFor lunch you will probably eat at the venue, it won't be cheap but you won't have time to go elsewhere.\n\nDepending on industry you may hire local \"booth babes\" to look pretty and attract men to the stand, though thankfully many shows ban that nowadays.\n\nAll this adds up.  $2 million is not enough for a huge top tier stand at a top tier trade show.  But it would probably get you a very good stand at a top tier trade show.  It's \"A\" tier not \"S\" tier.",

            "comment": "In a former life I worked at one of a college's science departments.  One of my tasks was to write course material and problems for the students. It was a  task that I started months in advance because one, it was a lot of work and two, it was very important for the students to receive high-quality material. One year it was decided to rotate tasks and the professor I was working with asked one of my colleagues to provide material for their course, so I could focus on something else. \n\nMy colleague was happy he had been given what looked like an easy task. Everyone told him it was a lot of work, but he thought he could half-ass it and get away with it. He didn't start working on it until a week before the deadline. At which point it dawned on him that he would never finish on time. So my colleague sheepishly came to me and asked if he could borrow my work from a former year because it was too much and he couldn't possibly do it all in one week. I said \"of course\" and gave him my files. Then that prick started complaining to other people in the department that he had been given too much work, but thankfully he had been able to finish on time. My other colleagues told me this, I said nothing and waited. \n\nNow this was a STEM department, so some of us used to do everything with LaTeX. I was one of these people.  My colleague wasn't, and had no idea how to use LaTeX. I had a habit of signing all of my work. Every page was marked with something like \"This material was produced by Ofbearsandmen for professor XYZ's course - Sep. 20XX\". It was coded with a simple line in the LaTeX file, but my colleague had no idea. \n\nThe day before he was to give his documents to the professor he called me in a panic. \"-Hey, you gave me LaTeX files, but I don't know how to use them!\" I said\n\"No issue, open your email, I just compiled them and sent you the pdf files.\"\n\nA few minutes later he calls me again: \n-There's a problem, there's your signature over the document!\n\n-Oh you mean the year is wrong? \n\n-No, there's your *name* all over the course material!\n\n-Ah I see, just remove it in the source file, I think I gave it to you. \n\n-I don't know how to do this!\n\n-Look I'm sorry, I don't have the time to do this now. Anyway, it's my work, you wouldn't want people to believe it's yours, would you? Bye!\"",

People with actual functioning consciences wouldn't do shit like that, so it leaves us spinning for a loop for a bit, while they can do things like this with zero hesitation. While we're trying to figure out how their actions function within the frame of the \"rules\", they ignore the existence of said rules entirely. \n\nIn order to deal with people like this you have to come to the sometimes harsh realization that not everyone operates in good faith. This isn't to say you can't trust people. But you have to always keep in the back of your mind that people can switch up on you in a second, and if they do so in an undeniable way, have a plan to deal with it. \n\nOP handled this person wonderfully.",

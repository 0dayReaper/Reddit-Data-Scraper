    "postText": "You know how some small to medium sized businesses have a person that is the receptionist/payroll/accounts/office manager/boss's PA/social club/general dog's body all rolled into one? Yeah, I've done a few of those jobs.\n\nIf you are good at what you do, most of the people you work with don't know 90% of what you do. They come to work, the lights are on, milk is in the staff fridge. All is well. No one should notice anything until something breaks. Which works until you get a boss trying to be a self-proctologist on the regular. Then they think because they don't *see* it, you don't do it. Annoying.\n\nSo you amuse yourself in little petty ways. I had two favorites. The first was lowering his office chair by 2 inches when he was out at lunch. Especially when it was a long boozy client smooze. The best fun was the timebomb. Photocopying a blank sheet of paper with a paperclip in the corner a few times, then shuffling those pages into the ream of paper in the copier tray so random print jobs would have ghost paperclips on them. It of course wouldn't affect \"important\" jobs as they would be printed on nicer paper that would be loaded separately.\n\nHe never worked out the paperclips. Even called in the serviceman",

They put in lots of extra hours to please non-technical bosses who were terrified about what Y2K might do.  Those bosses made a much bigger deal of the situation than any of the programmers did.\n\nThanks to the programmers, the company had no problems when Y2K finally rolled around.  But then the bosses started complaining that \"Y2K was all hype about nothing\" and \"those programmers sure suckered us into paying them a lot of overtime\".  And from then on they treated the programmers as  if they were grifters and freeloaders.",

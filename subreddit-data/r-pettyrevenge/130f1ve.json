    "postText": "Hello reddit,\nThis isn't my story but my parents. \n\nSo back when my parents were in their 20's they lived near a big market in the capital city of my country. \nMy dad's an electician and went to work around 4AM so my mom was left to do basic chores and grocery shopping. \n\nOne day around 5PM she went to the store. The big market was closing up for the day but there where still plenty of people walking over the big street. \nWhile walking back to the apartment the fishmonger had just closed up and stepped in his car. \n\nThe guy started speeding towards my mom, almost hitting her while she was pretty frozen because this man was driving in high speed towards her on a buissy street. The guy stops and starts screaming at her why she didn't move and starts telling her to come closer so he can beat her up. My mom just walked home but was pretty shaken up by the whole ordeal and tells my dad. \n\nThe next day my dad gets to the fishmonger and asks him why he threatened to beat up his girlfriend to which the guy just threatens to beat up my dad aswell. My dad didn't feel like getting into a fight so the next morning when he goes to work very early he put superglue in his locks. \n\nThe whole day he couldn't get to his stand, he was cursing and bambling. Lost a whole day of sales and probably had to throw away a bunch of fish.",

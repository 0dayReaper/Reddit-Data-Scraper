    "postText": "So, I've had my number for 5 years, maybe 6, I don't remember exactly. When I got this number, the previous owner still got regular messages and phone calls, which is completely understandable that she didn't have everyone up to date on her newest number or lack of number.\n\n\n\nThe first 3 months it was nothing to me, I'd answer the calls, send them on their way. Well, that was until I got a phone call from an elementary school looking for, let's call her Sarah. Sarah's daughter was throwing up and running a high fever and needed to go home. I told the school that this was a new number for me and there was no Sarah around. I thought certainly this issue would make her come to the realization that she needed to update her number. But no.\n\n\n\nI had to block the schools number because I continued to get calls and texts that had way too much information about Sarah's daughter. Including her name, age, and school events with times and changes in school schedules. I wasn't comfortable receiving that info, so I blocked it.\n\n\n\nMaybe 2 or 3 weeks after i blocked the school, Sarah's grandmother calls me because I assume the school couldn't get ahold of Sarah. But I have to tell grandma that I'm not Sarah &amp; to please ask her granddaughter to update her information. Sarah still did not.\n\n\n\nWith all of the information that I unwillingly had on Sarah (full name, age, where she attends college, her home address, and where she works), I found her on Facebook and kindly asked her to not use her old number anymore. I'm not sure if she saw the message or not, but it didn't help my problem.\n\n\n\nThis has been ongoing for years and it's not just spam, it's people she knows, co-workers, family, doctors, her real estate agent even.... So, before, if she had appointments that were asking to be verified via text to my phone, I would just ignore them. But she had an appointment this time and I am just so fed up of Sarah STILL giving out this number after 5 years of this nonsense that I canceled her appointment for her. A few days later, a new appointment to the same place needed verification &amp; I canceled it again. And the next one I get will be cancelled also. Get your shit together Sarah!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntldr: person keeps using my number as their current contact info for 5 years, so I cancel all of her appointments that send text messages for a verification.",

I left her a voicemail informing her that I was NOT who she was looking for and asked her to please remove my number from the phone list.\n\nI received one final call from her, addressed to me, thanking me for updating them as they were unaware they weren't reaching the parent and it was important in case of an emergency to know that.

But im a dude and the lady from the cellphone lives in my hometown which was always weird to me as i live 3 hours north of it in a different area code (even with cells). Ive tried to contact both of these people with nothing coming back so now i toss the one ladies mail and the rare phone calls i get i do the same stuff i do to telemarketers no matter who it is and treat them very shitty while asking dumb questions in terrible foreign accent i randomly select at the time of the calling.  \n\n\nIve tried returning letters to sender and notifying sending parties the person hasnt lived here in forever, same with the phone calls.

In the last two years, I've gotten a ton of letters for Brenda. Most of them from credit card companies, banks, department stores which have their own credit cards, collection agencies, etc. One day I returned home and found a court summons stuck to my door for Brenda. Since it was just a stack of papers, I read through it. Apparently she opened a Well Fargo account &amp; got their credit card, then ran it up to the max and never paid it.   \n\nAnother time, sitting in my home office/game room, I heard someone walk up the stairs outside and drop a box at my door. Thinking to myself, \"I didn't order anything\", I went and grabbed the package. It was addressed to Brenda. Not 5 minutes after closing the door, her sister knocked on my door while on the phone with her asking for the package. I told her to stop scamming businesses and change her address because I was tired of getting her collection notices. Then I told her sister (loud enough so she should have heard me) to fuck off.   \n\nI still get mail with her name on it.  \n\nSo maybe Sarah's up to some shady shit and doesn't want anyone to have her real number.",

Honestly,  though,  I couldn't blame her,  the dudes who messaged me were so over the top aggressive and pushy (and just horrible people).\n\n They wouldn't believe I wasnt her,  they'd make super lewd comments about how much Tonya obviously wanted them because of such and such totally innocent gesture, they'd call and leave truly horrifying messages.  \n\nAt first I was just normal,  hey, sorry,  this isn't Tonya you have the wrong number. After awhile I messed with them before blocking, but it just made me bummed that ppl like Tonya have to deal with this shit.  I was so happy to change that number.",

About 8 years ago when we entered the current district we live in I gave them my name/info, my wife's name/info, and sister's as an emergency contact who was authorized to pick up the kids. They accidentally put in my sister as the kids' Mom, and my wife as the emergency contact. Female first name, same last name, so I get how it happened. However, when I noticed this on their self service website, there was literally no way to change it! For the next 5 years we went through a cycle of the school calling my sister first for everything related to our kids, despite us telling them repeatedly to fix it. Luckily my sister is very patient person and always relayed the info to us.\n\nWhat finally ended it was when one of my kids got injured at school, they called my sister, who was unavailable and didn't get the message. They then called me, and I was out of the country on business, so I didn't get it. After an hour, they finally decided to call the \"emergency contact\" - i.e. her mom! My wife went in there and just blew up at them in the school office, after hearing that her child was sitting there bleeding in the nurse's office for an hour because of this. Needless to say they magically fixed it that day!\n\nOh, and don't get me started on the other side of this... I had always told them to make me (dad) the primary contact as well because it's easier to answer the phone at my job than it is for my wife. We're still working on that one... sexism prevails.",

They actually asked my opinion. I begged them to get her to stop giving the number out. \n\nShe had a health scare cause I was getting tons of appts for her. I canceled them anytime they asked. I learned way too much of her medical issues. I felt bad about this one but this was a new doctor's office and I had the number for 4 years by that point. It was deliberate!\n\nShe's moved several times cause I've gotten her utility installation calls. I cancel those too. \n\nBanking. We use the same bank and evidently she took a trip to Oklahoma and spent 900 at Walmart. That sent me into a panic.\n\nCoworkers, past and present with me begging and pleading for them to tell her to stop giving out the number. Spoiler alert. She still does. \n\nEvidently she has a very creepy uncle. Shudder.\n\nJust last Sunday someone from her church texted asking if she wanted to have lunch and play hand and foot after church. I replied that it sounded too kinky for me but thanks for the offer. I imagine church was awkward after that. \n\nMoral of story. When you get a new number change your number otherwise some stranger is going to find out way too many intimate details of your life. She does not have any sort of social media either.",

Our protagonist is a businessman on a trip and decides to call a phone sex line. He picks up a phone book (yeah, see the year there?), picks the number for \"Main Line\" but then looks at the wrong number and dials Man Line.\n\nHe then gets a guy with an androgynous voice and after he realizes he's been PG-phone sexing with a man, yells \"You sick fucker!\" at the phone. The worker at the other end is offended and decides to fish the customer's details from their system. Stalking shenanigans for the rest of the show.\n\nI was truly bored in the early 90s, I tell you.

I get so much personal information (job interviews, doctors appointments, internet provider bills, cellphone bills, various university stuff, one PayPal account, Uber-account etc). \n\nI even one time got a Netflix subscription (several years ago), where I reset the password and held this account active for a couple of months until my conscience got the best of me. The name of the account holder wasn't even remotely close to my name. Netflix had this ridiculous feature where one could call their customer service to cancel the subscription, but later you could just login to your account and press \"reactivate\" or something like that and it would start the billing process again. So I did this a couple of times hoping to teach them a lesson.\n\nMany of these services allows you to reset the password through the email. I can really fuck with multiple people this way.\n\nI even managed to reset the PayPal account password but never got past the phone number verification. \n\nI'm shocked by how few services that actually requires you to verify your email address before they start sending you personal information. They ought to know better. The people however, people are fucking idiots.",

I really don't want to know other peoples' health or business details, thank you. I haven't had too much difficulty with small businesses, but trying to contact someone at eBay or Zillow was a complete PITA and took days to get resolved.  One instance was a power company in another part of my state, and they told me at first that I had to find out the actual person's information and get them to resubmit their info, but I told them that was BS, and they were guilty of sharing someone's private information, and that I'd contact the State if it continued.

She claimed it wasn't because they're on the east coast lol She got combative with me, so everytime she threatened me, I screamed in her ear. She finally hung up. I got a call an hour later (I get up to 6 a day) from a guy who threatened to call my employer (I don't work) and attach my wages, told him go ahead. They confirmed the employer for the person they're calling about and I just agreed. Thought that was the end, but sadly no.

Finally, one dude asked me \"Isn't this the number for the Senators office internship?\"  Turned out the internship paperwork had mistyped the phone number in one instance (of 3).  \n\nLooked it up and the office was actually nearby so I took a quick trip and went to say hello.  Mentioned to the lady behind the desk that there was a mistake and she acknowledged it and said it had been fixed that morning.  So I said \"So I shouldn't be getting anymore calls?\"  She got so flustered and apologized.",

It was always dudes on the other end sending creep messages. I\u2019d always send back that I am not her (furthest from probably) and if they know her to stop giving my number out to randos.  This lasted for two years until one day I got a very angry voicemail from a woman who was pissed that shequia did not show up to her court date and she was likely going to jail.  I called back and left a message telling her lawyer she constantly gives my number out and requesting that she stop being such a dumbass and to get her life together.   I never received a single call/text after that, so I just have to assume the message sunk in or shequia is somewhere in jail without a cell phone or random bar dudes to give my number out to.",

He'd put in a service call for something and it'd be canceled by me. Or a family member would text me, get the wrong number spiel. Obviously the previous owner was as dumb as Sarah is and wouldn't update their crap.\n\nUntil I realized there is less intelligence to be found elsewhere, in the form of the dude's bank.\n\nThey sent me *everything* in a text. Bank account numbers, passwords, all of it.\n\nDude, the level of adult good person I had to summon not to do something with that info was insane but I did delete it and inform the bank teller, *do not send this via text, I am not Tom*. It stopped happening after that too.",

One woman, when sent straight to voicemail due to the scheduled quiet hours on my phone, would leave 2-3 second messages of herself sighing and hanging up.  And I'm talking a dozen of them, not a minute apart.  This was 5 years after I bought the phone and 2 of those years it had been disconnected since I was overseas.  My phone couldn't block at the time so I blocked her with the phone company, 90 days at a time for several years until I bought a new phone that could block numbers and not just send them to voicemail.",

    "postText": "Before getting the engine rebuilt my old diesel was pretty smoky. While I know plenty of folks think rolling coal is cool, I am not a fan, especially on a daily driver. With the issues I was having it was honestly hard for me not to blow a little black smoke every time I accelerated, but especially if the rpm\u2019s were low and I gave it extra throttle instead of downshifting. \n\nI was driving down a 5 lane highway, two in each direction and a turn lane. The road was pretty empty ahead of me, but there were several cars not far behind. I cyclist coming from the other direction decided to make a u-turn across all five lanes and park himself in the middle of my lane. I had to brake fairly hard to keep from running up on him, which meant everyone in the other lane was now passing me at a speed I couldn\u2019t merge into to pass this guy. He also rode right down the middle of the lane instead of off to the side where there would have been plenty of space for me to safely pass him. When traffic finally eased enough that I had space to pass him I went from 3rd to 5th, and put the pedal to the floors. Try as it might my poor truck just couldn\u2019t draw enough air to account for all that fuel and it belched a cloud of black smoke that completely engulfed the cyclist. I just laughed as watched him disappear in my side view mirror. \n\nYes, I was an asshole, but if he had \u201cshared the road\u201d as so many cyclist request then I wouldn\u2019t have felt it necessary.",

            "comment": "A customer of my hubby told him this story.  The customer was on a paved county road with his truck and trailer of cows.  There was a group of cyclists that were hogging the whole lane.  (The law here is cyclists/motorcyclists are supposed to be single file, can't ride next to each other)  After a few miles of going cyclist speed in a 45mph zone.  The guy finally found a chance to pass.  He passed, about half the cyclists flipped him off, since they 'owned the road, y'know'.  As soon as he got into the lane in front of the cyclists, one of his cows, whose ass was up against the trailer, decided to take a dump.  As you may have guessed.. bullseye!  All he could see was a pile of cyclists is his rear view mirror.",

Many motorists, apparently including some posting here, take the presence of bicycles on the road as a personal insult that must be avenged.\n\nThe tactics, not so much, but I understand where they're coming from. Being a polite and considerate cyclist never kept me from being run off the road. I just think it's stupid to piss off someone who could so easily kill you.\n\nMy big problem with them is that every time I have seen Critical Mass in Seattle, they run down or otherwise terrorize pedestrians. \"How dare you try to cross the street.

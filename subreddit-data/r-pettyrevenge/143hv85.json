    "postText": "A few months ago I got a call from my very distressed and angry godson, his piece of shit mother(momster) and soon to be ex wife(stbx) have conspired to hide stbx's cheating and attempted theft of estate and heirlooms. \n\nQuick back story: I introduced Godsons parents without knowing at the time momster was a gold digging narcissistic monster. Parents had an extremely ugly and long divorce. When godson turned 18 and divorce was still on going father removed himself from his family's multi generational estate/trust to transfer all of it, including house to godson. As a xmas/Hanukkah present godson served both parents with eviction notice, fathers envelop also had a rental agreement. Within a few months parents divorce was finalized and both father and godson were no contract with Momster. Due to her deplorable treatment of godson I'm was already no contract with Momster.\n\nAfter godson vented about learning momster and stbx had been attempting to access the safety deposit boxes at banks, and safes within home with the intention of stealing contents. The final straw was stbx's flavor of the week along with the vile pair of women were  trying to cut into a safe when godson got home with their child she forgotten pick up. STBX and co-conspirators were so involved with the safe break in that the child was forgotten and godson was called by school to pickup child.\n\nGodson had a hinkling of stbx's infidelity beforehand and had security cameras footage in home and the doors cameras were backuped to estate lawyers, godson was in the process of drawing up divorce papers due to infidelity and was waiting for the more proof because godson wanted full custody of their child. Now his child is still a minor but of the age to choose which parent they want to live with, and wants to stay with godson and in the home. Stbx gets absolutely no monetary compensation due to infidelity as the very detailed prenuptial detailed. Stbx is pissed to say the least, and is trying all the dirty games momster tried all those years ago plus new games. Godson is heartbroken because he truly loves stbx, and his parents' divorce really affected him. He never wanted a repeat of his parents' divorce and didn't want his child to experience what he did. \n\nDurning one of our last call godson is venting about the newest manipulation of stbx and momster, and his and childs heartbreak, yes they are both in joint and individual therapy. I remembered something about  his parents divorce,  a little clause I mentioned to father to add to divorce decree. I never read their papers and am not sure if my little petty  addition was actually added. I mentioned to Godson to ask lawyers to research momsters' divorce papers for a 'conspiracy against estate' or something like that.\n\nI received a text from Godson. \"Is this your vengeful petty addition?\" Followed with an image full of legalese and momsters signature at end of paragraph.  The legalese basically stating any involvement to aquire trust/estate assets will nullify any and all previously incurred monetary compensation received by plantiff And all monetary compensation will be refunded to trust/estate with interest at market value. *snicker snicker, I really am a vindictive and protective godmom* \n\nI texted back, \"Bwhahaha..... yup, happy your father was pissed enough to add my pettiness.\"\n\nYes, momster got alimony, and yes, she agreed to the stipulation. So, yes, momsters' involvement in the attempted theft has caused her to lose alimony ,and now MUST repay all alimony with interest. \n\nI was petty vengeful even then, cooler minds(father and lawyers )prevailed and didn't allow me to car compactor all her belongings into a big cube, so I wanted to get her where she would feel it most. And I'm shocked godsons big teddy bear of a father really followed through with my addition to the divorce decree. \n\nMomster is now crying about her son stealing from her, stbx isn't fighting the divorce or child custody. And Godson and grand-godson are planning a summer world tour on momsters' dime. Finally, a new and updated 'vengeful petty clause' is being added to the new divorce papers. \n\nDon't hurt my godsons, or I'll come after you. Stbx email is being bombed with spam mail, thank from me. Whenever I see an email sign-up for free information, I use hers. It's a little pettiness and absolutely entertaining for me.\n\nEdited to make Stbx and momster easier to follow.",

During the divorce, everything was put into a trust for Johnny. Once finalized Joe and Johnny went LC/NC with Karen after Johnny gave her an eviction notice (since he owned the house). Joe was also given an eviction notice but a rental agreement came with it (aka not kicked out).\n\nJohnny was in the process of getting things ready to divorce Kelly because of her infidelity. Gathering evidence, etc. In Johnny and Kelly\u2019s prenup, there is an infidelity clause so she would get nothing in the divorce because of it. Jr is old enough to choose and wants to live with Johnny. \n\nKelly is like Karen and gold digger. Both working together to steal from security boxes at bank and safes at home\u2026 because \ud83d\udcb0\n\nOne day Johnny had to go pick up Jr from school because Kelly forgot to. They came home to find Karen helping Kelly try to break into the safes with the help of Kelly\u2019s current AP. \n\nJohnny was telling OP about all of the drama. OP remembers telling Joe to add a \u201cconspiracy against estate\u201d petty clause, but wasn\u2019t sure if Joe\u2019s lawyers actually added it. Johnny checked and sure enough, a clause was added that if Karen tried anything she would lose alimony and have to pay back plus interest. \n\nSo because Karen tried helping Kelly to steal, she now has to pay Johnny (aka the estate) what was given to her + interest. Because of this Kelly is not fighting the divorce and not fucking around because she doesn\u2019t want to find out\u2026. More than what she already has\u2026 aka getting nothing due to prenup. \n\nJohnny and Jr are using the money returned from Karen to travel for the summer. \n\n\nEdit: add what I missed and clarify sentences.",

In the 80\u2019s the recruiters were ruthless, much like some religious people who went door to door. Very satisfying petty revenge.",

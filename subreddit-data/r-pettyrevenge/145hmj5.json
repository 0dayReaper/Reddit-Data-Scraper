    "postText": "I travel a lot with my job and at this stage I tend to notice bad behaviour. As part of a journey this week, I was taking a short two-hour flight that involved being bussed to the plane. It was in mainland Europe with various languages being spoken.\nI got in the bus early as a priority passenger. I stood near the middle doors to get off earlier. There was a person already seated in the nearest seats to the door, with his arm across both seat backs. The spot was clearly marked for people needing assistance/elderly etc. He was a non-vulnerable American man.\nThe bus filled up with non-priority passengers, including people with small children, elderly etc. \nWe take off at speed but our friend doesn\u2019t bat an eyelid. Kids, parents, elderly, struggling to stay standing on a fast bus. No worries, he\u2019s very happy stretched across his two seats. \nWe arrive at the plane steps and he leaps from his seat trying to push past me. My auto-petty kicked in and my arm rose automatically to grab the pole  in front blocking his exit (I honestly think I was on autopilot). \n\nHis nibs mutters \u201creally?\u201d \n\nI mutter softly \u201cI\u2019m holding the bar to keep my balance, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\nHe shuts up\nFuck they understood me\u2026\n\nI hammed up a genuinely bad foot (broken bone) to limp off the bus and up the steps, delaying him as much as possible and letting others pass me by. \n\nBonus, I got my luggage off the carrousel before him too; as an American he has to bring multiple suitcases everywhere.\nSailed out of the terminal thinking \u201csee ya asshole\u201d!",

We had a scheduled sauna session by a lake one night. I was sitting on the patio afterwards just chilling with some female scientists from multiple countries and there were several American grad students just being loud, rowdy and goofy in the lake. Really out of place in the post sauna tranquility. Someone from Norway just turned to me and said \"you're not like other Americans. Why not?\" Two others chimed in \"yes, that's true. Why is that?\"   ....  I dont remember what I answered but I took it as a compliment of the highest order \ud83d\ude09",

    "postText": "My wife got hired by a well-known big-box store as a department manager. Her manager really liked her and when he was transferred to a store 30 minutes away, he asked that she follow and promoted her to assistant manager of the store.\n\nWe even moved to be closer to her new location.\n\nThen they began an affair.\n\nRather than flip out on either one of them, I called the company's Integrity Hotline and reported him (turned over inappropriate love letters, holiday cards etc. - which he'd signed).\n\nOne month later - he was out of a 6-figure job, and she got transferred back to her original store.\n\nAs a final blow, I delivered his still-dirty clothes (found at my place) to his wife (who also worked for the same company).\n\nSure I felt like clocking the guy, but that's a crime - so I killed his career and marriage instead.\n\nEDIT - Divorced her soon after.",

You'd see them in Waikiki waggin' their little tails on dancefloors in every joint.  Equally astounding was the number, the sheer percentage, of sailors who got married to Pilipino and Thai women.  Don't know how it is now, but when I was in, it was a matter of a little paperwork for these women to become US citizens.  As you can imagine, the disparity in looks between these women and the sailors was insane.  A lot of the guys were virgins.  In many cases, once they got stateside, over time, the women divorced these guys and found somebody with more money, better looking, etc.\n\nAh nature.  You always balance out.",

( Email existed in a nascent form, fax-blasting was apparently more fun)\n\nEveryone in the company got a personal fax with the lovers' agenda. \"This is Sid and Nancy's agenda for the coming week\".\n\nNuggets included entries like:\n\nTues March 11, 12-1;30 pm, Motel Six, El Camino, Santa Clara.\n\nWed March 12, 7:30-11:00pm MArriott Hotel Reception and afterwards, Room 1210\n\nEtc, etc. The HR people were literally running around unplugging the fax machines.\n\nShe had risen rapidly in the ranks from a humble receptionist, largely due to her breast implants preceding her actual approach by a good thirty seconds. Had she screwed a VP, instead of a humble sales puke, she might have survived the scandal, but she had to go; too embarrassing.\n\nI was not in the office when the aggrieved husband came in and knocked the adulterer on his ass, but that day lived on in history in the company annals.",

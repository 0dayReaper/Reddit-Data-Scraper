    "postText": "This was about 10 years or so ago. My department head was let's call him \"Kenny\" (VP of Software Engineering) led our team of about 8 or so people. He had hired 2 team leads almost exactly like him who were essentially his \"bootlickers\" and drooled over every word he said, even though his ideologies made little to no sense.\n\nFor those of you not familiar with the world of software, every years years at least, you have to bring your code base to something more current. This does a few different things, it keeps the team more engaged and keeps the code standards up to date instead of using something essentially \"out of date\". Ours wasn't updated in more than 8 at this point. We were a Java shop and for those of you know, Java is an OO language that supports high code reuse etc. Unfortunately ours was NOT even close to an OO code base. I had pointed that out a few times but neither the leads nor \"Kenny\" wanted to take any notice or make any changes. There was especially one application that was TERRIBLY written.. Let's call in the \"ReOrdering\" application. It was written in JAVA but it was completely procedural, 3 really really BIG methods ( I am talking about each method being a few THOUSAND lines long, without ANY exaggeration). This was one application that every developer knew was pure crap and even the leads agreed. Of course no one would say anything coz \"Kenny\" originally wrote it some 10+ years ago. Another thing about \"Kenny\" was, everything was his way or the highway. If you said anything contrary to \"Kenny's\" view, you were let go a week later, not matter how right you were or how wrong he was.\n\nThankfully 2 year after my joining 'Kenny's\" company, I got a wonderful offer from a different company and gave notice. My sendoff kinda coincided with \"Kenny\" coming to our local office. At lunch he mouthed off a bunch of things like \"I can't believe how much BAD CODE there is out there in companies.\". THIS was MY chance! I quickly and very politely &amp; innocently interjected, \"Oh you mean like our 'ReOrdering' application? Wow not sure who wrote that!\" (even though I knew full well 'Kenny' did!). His face turned to ASH, and for the FIRST TIME ever we all saw him DEAD SILENT and completely BROUGHT DOWN from his HIGH HORSE!\n\nI hate to admit it but THAT FELT GREAT!! Best part even though I could see him seething, he could not do JACK about it coz i was already leaving!",

The simulation package we used (FORTRAN!) had a number of bugs that no one could solve.  I was digging around in the source code and found author notes older than I was.  This would not stand!\n\nI went to my boss and asked for permission to write a replacement simulation package.  Boss was like, \"I think you're biting off more than you can chew but I encourage you to try.  You'll learn a lot in failure.\"\n\nTurned out I could chew a lot.  A couple years later the old simulation package was retired as mine took over.\n\nThat was 1997.\n\nThe grapevine tells me that they're still using my package.  It grates on the users 'cause it's older than some of the guys using it.  But every time they ask management for the funds to have a replacement written they get shot down because, \"Does what we want it to do and has no known bugs.  Simply being 'old' isn't enough reason to throw it out.\"\n\nI'm fast approaching retirement.  My hope is that I get retired before it does.  If so, I figure that sim package will be the single most successful thing I did in my career....even if it was also the first serious project I took on.",

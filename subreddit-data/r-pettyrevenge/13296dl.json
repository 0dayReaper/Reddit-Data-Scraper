    "postText": "Several years ago I matched with this guy on a dating app. Let\u2019s call him Zach. We had texted each other for a few days and had plans to hang out that next weekend. It seemed to be going well! \n\nThen he found out it was my birthday the next day (Thursday). I had plans already with family to go out to dinner, but he said he\u2019d take me out for ice cream afterwards. He even texted me Thursday afternoon to confirm we were still good for that night. \n\nAt dinner I declined getting any birthday dessert with my fam, as I had ice cream to look forward to! We said our goodbyes and I went home to wait for Zach to pick me up. \n\nWell, he was 15 minutes late and I texted asking if he was still on his way. He replied that he was running late, just leaving work. Ok, no problem. \n\n30 more minutes went by. I texted asking if he was alright\u2026. The message couldn\u2019t be delivered. Wtf? I thought maybe his phone died. Waited a bit longer, then decided to check if he\u2019d blocked me for whatever reason. Welp, he had. We were unmatched on the dating app and he unfriended me on Facebook (he\u2019d friended me the day before). \n\nI was so freaking mad. This dude stood me up ON MY BIRTHDAY and wasted my night when I could\u2019ve made other plans with friends. And he had the audacity to text me he was running late when he knew damn well he wasn\u2019t coming. \n\nHis mistake was not blocking me on social media. I found his married brother (hoping married meant somewhat responsible) on Facebook and messaged him. I feigned concern, saying Zach was going to take me on a birthday date but said he was running late, and then his messages stopped delivering and I was worried he\u2019d gotten in an accident. The brother was concerned, saying it was super weird and he\u2019d try to make sure he was ok.\n\nThe next morning Zach messaged me on Facebook giving a half assed apology because \u201cmy brother said I needed to.\u201d I assume he got chewed out, which is just so satisfying. \n\nI asked why he stood me up and he just said I was \u201ctoo pure\u201d for him and he didn\u2019t want to \u201cpull me down with him.\u201d Whatever the f that means. Whatever the reason, he didn\u2019t get away with it and was forced to apologize, and that made my petty side so happy.\n\nEdit: typo",

It wasn't even very rainy, but there were definitely some sprinkles. But she was simply stood up, and that on a sundae! OP wasn't dumb and got the scoop. And Zachs brother was a softie for OP, her feigned concern made him melt. And the cherry on top was that Zach had to apologise. In the end, they just weren't mint to be.",

Speaking of podcasts with lots of puns, do you know Punwatch?\n\nIt's an Australian podcast where the \"panelists\" have to guess the pun in the headline of a newspaper story with the headline removed. Extra points for most acceptable/\"plausible\" puns guessed for a story.\n\nBecause they get that story sent to them in advance, they don't have to flounder during the show until they run out of their prepared puns for a story and the quality of those puns is quite nice (though when someone is about to run out of puns for a story, the definition of \"plausible\" gets stretched beyond its breaking point; funny on its own, imo).",

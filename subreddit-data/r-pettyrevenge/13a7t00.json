    "postText": "Someone had posted about people parking too close to them in garages and it reminded me of this story. I think it fits here. \n\nI was at the grocery store a few years ago with my then-infant, whose car seat was located in the seat behind the driver. When I got back with my groceries, some dildo had parked their car so close to mine that I could barely squeeze through, let alone manage my way with my baby's car seat.\n\nSo, I took down the license plate number and car info and went back into the store and asked to speak to the manager. I said I was concerned because \"the car had smoke coming out of its hood but no one was around.\"\n\nThe manager put a call out on the intercom with the car info and the apparent fire under the hood. I went back outside and watched as a woman ran out like a bat outta hell to check on her car. I asked if she was okay and she said she thought her car was on fire. I said \"oh how strange. Good thing it isn't! Hey, while you're here, mind moving your car so I can get to my side? You're parked a little close.\"\n\nShe was apologetic and did (still fazed by the announcement, probably). I'd like to think that she realized later on that it was probably me who put in the fake announcement, lol.",

This one particular store conveniently had a well-marked delivery zone right in front of the store. Great! Not so much, people routinely parked in it, so trucks were not able to get in. It was a very busy street and parking was a huge problem there. So I often had to park quite far away and haul my stuff down the block. One day, I am making my routine delivery and see that a beverage truck is double-parked in front of the store, blocking in a car. (Read well-known large cola company.) Karen comes out screaming, \"Move your truck, or I will call the police.\" Driver says go ahead.\" Police come and ticket the woman for parking in a loading zone, and Karen had to wait until beverage guy was done to move.",

            "comment": "OMG this has given me such a great idea.\n\nSo, on very rare occasions, I\u2019ve had someone park in my condo parking spot.  It\u2019s a tandem space, with room for two cars in a row.  So usually my car is in the back, and my wife\u2019s car is in the front.  (I don\u2019t need my car to get to work, she does.)\n\nWhen some jerk parks in our spot, they block my car in, and also prevent her from parking.\n\nTo make matters worse, in my city, a car can\u2019t be towed without some kind of permit that only the building manager can complete.  No towing company will touch a car without that permit.  The building manager only works 9-5 Monday to Friday.  Any other time, there\u2019s nothing you can do to get someone\u2019s car towed.\n\nHowever, there is a number I can call for emergencies only.  *They* can then call the building manager at any time, but of course they\u2019ll only do it if there\u2019s an actual emergency\u2026.  Like maybe if I thought I could see smoke coming from under the hood of a car\u2026. See where I\u2019m going with this?\n\nOne could perhaps toss a burning incense stick under the car, so there is actual smoke, and the property manager will therefore not think his time was wasted\u2026as much.\n\n\u201cOh, and while you\u2019re down here, this car is also parked in my space, and isn\u2019t mine.  Can you fill out one of those towing permits for me?\u201d\n\nMua ha ha ha ha!\n\nI\u2019m actually pretty sure at least some of the people who have parked in my space without permission knew *exactly* what they were doing, and knew that I can\u2019t have them towed\u2026. Or can I?  The next person who fucks around with my parking spot is going to find out.",

He got creative and every parking spot ( they were inside garage) was allowed a storage bin in the space but nothing flammable in them. He pulled his storage container behind the intruding cars back tire bumper area ( I wasn\u2019t there but I did see pics). He removed the few things he kept in and then filled it with cement. Yea he used the car he couldn\u2019t park to run to Home Depot or something and got sacks of cement and bucket to haul water. He  figured at the time the person had piggy backed a resident to get in and was going to the Fourth of July events at a park two blocks over that was parking blocked off the day before. It was around 11am and he had lots of time. The owner of the car got back In eventually ( he didn\u2019t see him get in so not sure if walked in with a resident) the cars owner actually called the emergency number posted in the garage area because he couldn\u2019t leave. The phone tree from that eventually got to my friend around midnight. So my friend ignored it until the next day. He says that what he heard was the owner couldn\u2019t move the storage bin it was mostly wet concrete inside a 99 gallon tub lol. My friend had parked in the open lot and walked to his apt after offloading the concrete so he had all the time in the world.  Eventually guy called cops but they couldn\u2019t do anything except ticket him for trespassing on private property. He tried building management and they did question my friend but his lease said only exceptions were it not be flammable and must be in his allotted space. After two days he had a bunch of friends help him move it and the car got removed.",

He warned the other five of us that he was going to pour glass on the concrete in our parking area about six in the morning the next Saturday, so anyone who needed to get out, let him know and he would sweep the glass up so they could leave then put it down again. He also got a buddy studying graphics to make a sign that said \"High Crime Area. Park at your own risk.\" and put it on a pole at the end of the short driveway. This worked amazingly well, and he would continue this for the rest of the season. Only one guy ever parked in our lot after that. He had a small car so as soon as he left several guys who were there at our house for a party carried his car down the street to a no-parking zone and left it there. When dude came back hours later, no one knew what he was talking about, this is private parking, you were probably towed or your vehicle was stolen.",

When I came out some out of stater had parked next to me so close that I could not open my drivers door. I was pissed! I put my things in on the passanger side them went in to the store. Very loudly from the door area I asked if the driver of the whatever car brand with Mass plates was in line. This woman said it was her. I asked her to move her car so I could get in and leave. She was very embarrased and came out to move her car. She almost hit the side of my truck twice, but I finally was able to get in and leave.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Some people!",

But it backfired on him.\n\nNew guy worked for a crew that would often be out of town for a few days in a row.  The crew set up and operated sound systems for outdoor shows.  Normal practice was employees leave their cars in the company parking lot and ride to the job site using company vehicles, which is what the new guy did.\n\nNew guy didn't know that the owner had a favorite parking spot.  None of our spots are marked (except for handicapped spots) so he had no reason to know.  There was nothing special about the owner's favorite spot (it was among several other spots), and the owner could park in another spot right beside his favorite spot.  But the owner was livid that somebody was in his spot!\n\nOwner found out whose car it was, and called him claiming that his car was on fire!  Got the guy really worked up (and also repeated the lie to the guy's onsite crew leader).  Crew leader let the guy take one of the company trucks back to the office, where he found nothing wrong with his car but the owner laughing at him.  New guy quit on the spot.\n\nTurned out, the job site was not completely set up when the crew leader let the guy leave in that company truck, and there was equipment that the site needed still on the truck.  Since the guy quit instead of bringing it back to the site, they had to find somebody to deliver it - made the whole show start three hours late.  Customer was not happy, and cancelled the remaining shows on our contract.  Customer was a big name production company, and helped get us blacklisted.",

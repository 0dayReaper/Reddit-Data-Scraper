    "postText": "So I was not the one that came up with this idea but I\u2019m a benefactor of the situation. Every year there is a charity softball game held in our county with rotating beneficiaries. This year all money raised was to support individuals in the county with cancer. Not to pay direct medical bills but to assist with all the other costs such as travel expenses, lost wages, etc. \n\nThere are lots of fundraising opportunities at this tournament but it\u2019s just a one day tournament so it is strictly BYOB as those running the tournament aren\u2019t going to get a liquor license. It\u2019s run this way every year. The complex this tournament is hosted at has concessions that are run independently from the tournament. \n\nThis year the lady who runs concessions got something stuck up her ass or something because she got pissed off and called the cops saying that those running the tournament were selling beer without a license. This was not true but news of the incident spread pretty far throughout the county. \n\nOne of the guys we\u2019ll call him Scott, who is one of the leaders for the tournament was understandably furious, and so this week there is another tournament being hosted at the same complex by a different organizer the hosting team has ties to this lady that called the cops. \n\nSo Scott is looking for a way to boycott this tournament but realizes that having his team skip the tournament will be generally ineffective. So he comes up with this brilliant plan to hit em where it hurts. Scott and his team who are sponsored by a local bar go to every other team in the tournament and inform them they each have a $100 credit at the sponsors bar and requests teams don\u2019t hang out and buy beer at the tournament. \n\nThe bar sponsoring Scott\u2019s team catches wind of this and decides to match the $100 giving each team a $200 tab to keep them from buying beer at the tournament. \n\n\nTLDR: some bitch called the cops on a charity tournament who was doing nothing wrong, so a team bought beer for everyone else so they wouldn\u2019t spend money at her tournament.\n\n\nEdit: There was a great question. This tournament that we are boycotting is not a charity tournament. Profits from this tournament go to the team hosting the tournament and helps pay for tournament entry fees, hotel expenses for state, uniform expenses, etc. This lady is associated with the hosting team and the team\u2019s manager is an out of touch dick that refuses to listen to the input from the rest of the league and just bullies his way as \u201ccommissioner\u201d. \n\nWhenever he goes to tournaments hosted by other teams he always without fail refused to pay the $2 gate fee saying that the commissioner doesn\u2019t pay gate fees. \n\nAs a note. These tournaments are not league sponsored. Teams host them independently and within the county teams just make it a priority to generally support other county teams by participating in such tournaments.",

    "postText": "I recently had to work on a group project for grad school with three other classmate of mine, May, Samantha and Zoey(Fake names). May, Sam and I are in our 20s and Zoey is in her 50s. Zoey has always been a little mean to everyone in the class, including the professor. No one thought anything of that. \n\nCut to this last week we finally started working on our group project which is due next week (we have 2 weeks left) because Zoey was busy with her family stuff and did not want to even respond to the group messages. We unanimously decided that May is going to be our team leader that communicates with our prof for any questions, this pissed off Zoey because she thought she was gonna be the leader coz she\u2019s \u201colder and has more experience than a bunch of 20 somethings\u201d. \n\nOur prof made it a point that we have to submit meeting minutes to make sure we are actually communicating with each other. She also mentioned that if there are any issues we have to sort it out on our own coz we are all grown ups.\n\nSo when we finally had our first online meeting after Zoey rescheduled it 6 times, we were discussing about how we could compile our work and who should start with the presentation. We decided that May should start, followed by Zoey, then Me and finally Sam would conclude, coz our papers made sense in that order. Zoey started throwing a fit  saying how we are disrespecting her and we never ask for her opinion. So we asked her to talk to us about what she wants and she said since she\u2019s older she should have been the leader and since we didn\u2019t make her the leader she should at least be allowed to go first, coz elders should be respected. I tried to explain how Zoey\u2019s paper does not talk about the basics of our topic but May\u2019s actually explains all the basics, and how our prof told that there should be a flow to our paper. \n\nZoey immediately burst out screaming at me and May. She started calling us names and saying how we are ganging up on her and how Sam is the only one who respects Zoey and her age. Sam cut in and was trying to tell Zoey to not call names and to calm down a little and Zoey let out an ungodly scream and started yelling at all three of us saying she always saw us as her kids and how our parents didn\u2019t teach us any manners on how to talk to grown ups. She was mainly yelling at May for \u201ctattling to the prof\u201d about her, when in reality our prof specifically told us that she will not listen to any problems about anyone in the group. May was trying to explain that there might have been a misunderstanding, but Zoey didn\u2019t give her a chance to explain and kept yelling at her. Since I created the teams meeting link I had an option to mute her, I muted Zoey and told her \u201chey if you want her to explain, take a breather and let May talk. You can\u2019t constantly yell and ask for an explanation without giving her a chance\u201d. For the rest of the meeting Zoey was calm and didn\u2019t say anything rude. \n\nWhen Sam typed the meeting minutes and put it up on google shared docs I went in and added \u201cZoey yelled at May, Sam and OP name for 20 mins of the meeting\u201d. Everyone in our group can see that including our prof and Zoey doesn\u2019t check that, May was against the idea but Sam couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Our prof saw that emailed everyone in the class saying how it\u2019s important to be respectful of everyone. I think she deserves it.\n\nUpdate: So Zoey saw the meeting minutes and blew up our group chat demanding to know who wrote that. No one responded. She tried calling all of us multiple times. She sent multiple messages saying how we humiliated her in front of the prof. Finally, we had a meeting 30 mins ago and she was livid screaming at all of us saying how she hated us, how god is watching all our actions, and how she doesn't want to work with us anymore. I told her \"Well Zoey we don't wanna work with you either, there's no other option now, and let's finish this project.\"",

It sounds like you will come out of this with some experience dealing with difficult people, which will definitely come in handy in jobs.\n\nAlso, group projects suck and a group member yelling should very much be something a professor should want students to come talk to them about. People not doing their part? Work it out in the group. Yelling like that? Very much bring it to someone else. In any sort of professional setting, you would go to HR or the director of the event or whatever. Not deal with that yourself.",

This is BULLSHIT! I\u2019ve been in a corporate setting for 20 years and I have done three professional cert programs in that time. They always make us do team projects and they always bust out that stupid shit about handling your own issues. This is because the profs don\u2019t want to deal with it. If this happened in the workplace, you can go straight to your boss or the problem person\u2019s boss. If necessary, you can go to HR. If someone is this out of control and abusive, this is considered a violation of our professional standards policy and we are expected to report it, and not to try and handle it ourselves. I would suggest going to your prof and explaining this beyond team conflict, this is crossing the line into inappropriate and harassing behavior. Tell the prof \u201cI totally get that you expect us to deal with it ourselves but it has gone beyond what we can reasonably be expected to deal with and I wanted to talk to you about it before we go to &lt;whatever office on campus handles harassment complaints&gt;\u201d",

Heck, some even older than my grandparents if they still lived. \n\nThis job is something I do on the side and consists of mostly retired individuals. \n\nThere\u2019s a handful that think they can talk down to someone simply because they are older. I found out that the only way to deal with them is to be as rude to them as they are to me. Because respect goes both ways. \n\nIt has nothing to do with age, it has a lot to do with the education and maturity of said individual. Always shut it down quickly before it gets out of hand. \n\nI say you reach out to your professor and let them know that you have decided to exclude this person from the group project. As your professor stated, you are grown ups and things must be resolved on your own. It seems the only way to resolve this now is to cut her loose.",

We were pretty sure our group member was doing drugs that impaired her ability to function academically and as a teammate.

Your professor isn\u2019t going to do much, so bust out the work and CYA with the recordings and notes. Maybe don\u2019t even invite Zoey back just so you all can have some peace.",

You are all equals, you are all classmates, the only one \"above you\" is your teacher. Academic context is not a bus where she had priority on the seats over you.\n\nYou really did well on muting her to stop her tantrum. It's also good that you are looking fowards to talk with your professor to sort this out.\n\nMy advice, RECORD the meeting. I don't know if the you can do it in the app, but I think you have some complements that could help you so. Recording can help zoe to tune down her sheananigans, or at least will give you evidence to show your proffesor how bad you have it with her.",

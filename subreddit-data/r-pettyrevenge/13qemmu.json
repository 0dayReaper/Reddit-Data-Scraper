    "postText": "So for context I'm a pharmacy technician that has worked for a chain pharmacy for 3 years but now eork for a local one. However, one thing that annoyed me was when customers has purchases that were like 1 to 10 dollars and would give me a $50 or $100 bill, when I clearly see they have smaller change. I'm thinking (we're not a bank so stop giving us large bills). Then at one point we had a shortage of small bill so if your purchase was small you had to pay with card or small bill.\n\nPetty revenge time.\n\nSo when customers would give me big bills we would put them in a money envelope like what you get at a bank. My revenge was stapling the money money bag through the money to their prescriptions so when they went to get their change they might rip the money or take forever trying to get the staples out. And most customers just drive off before realizing this so it's too late to complain.\n\nThanks for reading\n\n\nFor those curious it was near the tips of the bills that I stapled.\n\nAlso I would ask if they had smaller bills and would say no. Or they company would have a sign saying no large bills if a purchase was small but they would still try to give us large bills.\n \nAn example, is when I had a customer give me a 2 dollars for an 86 cent purchase. Or like then time I had a 2 dollar and a customer gave me a 100 dollars",

But we had a big sign on the door and around the store that read \n\"no change, either pay with exact change, or card, otherwise you wouldn't get any change back\" \nPeople would get pissed at first but then scrounge around their purse or car and either find the exact change or they would pay with a card....  \n\nWe also had on the door no bills larger than $20 between 10pm and 6am.... (Ours was mainly cause people would come in and try and pass fake bills off to the younger employees that worked night shift) \n\nLive by my moto *DON'T BE A DICK*",

Their purchase comes to $21.83. They buy a $20 gift card, then split their purchase as $20 cash and $1.83 from the gift card. Reload gift card as necessary.",

They would give me their money, and that's what I used. I would then give them what was purchased, their receipt, and the change. There were times if I had enough small bills to cover what was owed and the change, I'd pay with a smaller bill. If I didn't, then I just used what I was given. \n\nOP, I know how things can be frustrating at work, but keep in mind there's a lot worse going on in this world.

That customer may require the small bill to pay the kid that mows the lawn. I picked that example randomly, and it may not be the truth or otherwise, but sometimes you have to break a large bill so that you have change; a smaller bill to pay something else.\n\nYou are a business, not a bank, but you have to give change. Sometimes, you actually do have to give change and to require the customer to drive/walk to the other side of a town or city just to break a large bill at a bank, that is totally unreasonable.\n\nAnd before everyone goes off on this comment, I usually try to pay with the smaller bills in my wallet but sometimes I have to plan on breaking a large Bill even if I have a smaller Bill suitable for the charge because when I get to the large bill I now have no, zero choice and it is maybe or is totally impossible to break that large bill. Now what do I  do?\n\nJust saying and I'm not being a dick. I have to break that large Bill sometime and to expect some businesses or otherwise like the kid that mows your lawn to be able to break a large bill when a pharmacy like Reddito BluePhonixS98 said he/she works at, has a large turnover of business. Or Redditor timmaL51308 in his truck stop, each has a huge turnover of business.....",

Sometimes people need to break a larger bill for future purposes later.  Or they have those smaller bills earmarked for something else, one never knows.  But then you can be polite and state your situation as a merchant who maybe can't break a larger bill at this time.  \n\nInstead you decide to be a poor employee who can't fathom how to properly do a job you're getting paid for and actively be a shitbagpieceofshit.

    "postText": "Hi everyone, this one will be short and sweet.\n\nWe begin our story on me. I'm a regular dude with an Amex card that gives me a $10 credit every month to purchase goods through Uber's companies. As such, I generally use UberEats once a month when I'm feeling lazy because of the credit and how it brings down order totals to about what they normally are in-store.\n\nUber, like many apps, loves to send out push notifications about deals going on and I would use these deals in conjunction with the $10 credit. However, at one point, I started to get notifications every couple of days about a sale such as \"40% off up to $15\". Usually, the coupons are for participating restaurants and I would always pick one from that list just to clarify if anyone misinterprets my coupon use lol. Things were different though. I'd tap on the push notification, which would open the app up, but there wouldn't actually be a coupon in the \"Promos\" section of the app when i checked.\n\nThis slightly upset me a few times, but after the 5th time of that happening, I decided to start screenshotting the promo and saving my notification history for Uber. The next time that it happened I decided to place an order after tapping the notification and selecting a restaurant of my choosing. I got the food I wanted and saw the final price. Full price without the 40% off. I decided to take it to Uber support which I'm sure y'all know how horrendous it is.\n\nFirst agent listens and would like to see the notifications. I promptly send them screenshots and they give me the difference as a refund.\n\nNext time it happens, support and I go through the same back and forth about how I'm getting sale notifications, but the app itself wasn't actually running promos for me. They clear it up and I get a refund.\n\nNext time it happens, support and I go back and forth, but now this rep plainly says, \"no, you didn't have any promos, so we aren't refunding you.\" Even though I had screenshots of them literally advertising me a coupon.\n\nAlright, if that's how you wanna play it over a few bucks, then I'm game. I proceed to reach out to Amex's support and basically explain my situation how Uber keeps advertising sales that don't really exist to me. I ask the support staff if a chargeback is even possible for a situation like this. The rep quickly responds \"yes, we can initiate one right now, but I'll need some details first...\" So, we calculate the amount of money Uber owes me to be $8 and some change. Super petty, but Uber is also a massive company and why would they try so hard for $8 when they were in the wrong? Chargeback was initiated and I end my chat with the rep.\n\nNot 3 hours later, I get an email from Uber apologizing for the inconvenience (like they gave a flying fuck in the first place) to which they refunded me $8 and some change in addition to giving me an extra $5 credit for the hassle. Amex reached out shortly after and said they reached a resolution with Uber and they were closing my ticket. I also stopped getting sale notifications for a while after this lol.\n\nAlways use a credit card for purchases folks!",

I worked at another credit card company and have verified with colleagues that worked at amex that disputes under a certain amount are just eaten by the credit card company because it would cost more in labor and such to do a charge back.",

No chargeback whatsoever.  \n\nOver the years, they increased it to $25.  The cost of a chargeback is like $12.  Factor in employee time to work the dispute, and it just didn't make sense to file a chargeback for that low of a price, so we just wrote it off every time.",

If a charge back is done the merchant gets the opportunity to dispute it.

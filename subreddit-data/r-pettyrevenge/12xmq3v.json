    "postText": "This is a story from somewhere around 20 years ago so the quotes may not be exact, but they\u2019ll get the point across. My boss in the first cabinet shop I worked in was doing pretty well for himself. It wasn\u2019t handed to him, but he busted his ass and worked for everything he had, and he loved jet skis. If I recall he owned 14 at one point, and loved stopping in at a local dealership just to see what\u2019s there. \n\nHe stopped in one day to look at a new model that Yamaha (I think) had just come out with that was supposed to be the fastest production jet ski on the market. They only had one in stock and as he walked around it looking it over a young fella at the counter yelled over \u201cyou can\u2019t handle that one old man, it\u2019s too fast for you. Besides that, I\u2019m working on the financials for it right now.\u201d My boss just smirked, looked at the owner and asked \u201cHey Bill (I don\u2019t know the owners name, but my boss was in there enough that they were friends), if he\u2019s working on a payment plan, and I offered to cut you a check, who would you sell it to?\u201d\n\nBill said \u201cI\u2019d have to go with the guaranteed money and sell it to you.\u201d\n\nBoss: \u201cok, I\u2019ll go get my trailer.\u201d",

He even had a 40\u2019 car hauler that he put two rails on to hold 6 jet skis, then we mocked up a support system to put a third rail down the middle that sat above the lower two so he could haul 9 jet skis at once.

    "postText": "We recently bought a new cat tower. We have 5 cats who play hard and the old tower was definitely showing use. The cats had torn up the carpet and sisal, vomited in one of the cubes and decapitated the hanging mouse who's name is Earl because why not.\n\nWe set up the new tower and after asking around to our friends couldn't find anyone who wanted it. So we took it out to the curb to get rid of it. Large trash pickup was coming up so we figured if anyone wanted it, they would have plenty of time to grab it before trash pickup. In our neighborhood, as long as the item is not on the curb for more than a week, you won't get cited for having trash in your yard. No big deal, right? Oh, no, it's a big deal cause Karen and Kevin have decided they want the tower.\n\nI work from home but my office is in the back of my house. We have a ring camera and around 10 am one morning the door bell rings. I am in a meeting with my boss so I check the app, see that I don't know who these people (Kevin and Karen) are and go back to my meeting. About 45 minutes later the door bell rings again. Now, I'm out of my meeting and since I'm expecting packages I check the app, see that it's the delivery guy and then head out front to grab my packages off the porch. I hear the notification going off on my phone as I'm opening the door and there stands Kevin and Karen with my packages and the cat tower. Kevin is holding my packages.\n\nMe: Can I help you?\n\nKevin: We are interested in the cat tower.\n\nMe: Go for it, it's been left out for large trash, you can have it. May have my packages please?\n\nKaren: The carpet and the sisal on the tower is torn; I'm going to need you to fix that before we take the tower. And there is vomit on it; that needs to be cleaned as well.\n\nMe: I'm not going to fix anything on the tower, we are throwing it away. If you want the tower, take the tower. If not, it will be picked up later this week with large trash. Now, may I please have my packages?\n\nKevin: (obviously realizing I'm not concerned at all about the state of the cat tower) well, we still want the cat tower. I'm just going to leave it on your porch and we will come back with our truck this weekend and pick it up. (He is still holding my damn packages)\n\nMe: That won't work for us. See, we are trying to get rid of the tower and I don't want it on my porch which is why it is on the curb. So, if you want the tower and you aren't going to take it right now, I'm not going to hold it for you. **PLEASE GIVE ME MY PACKAGES.**\n\nAbout this time my phone started ringing and I needed to get back to work. But I wasn't going to leave without my packages. Just as I am about to get angry with these people, my retired military grizzled biker looking neighbor pulls up in his pick up truck (he is a big pussy cat but it very protective of us and especially our two daughters.)\n\nMy neighbor calls over to me and starts heading over to where we are standing on my porch. I guess Kevin got nervous so at that point he shoved my packages at me and then said \u201cwell, just leave the tower on the porch and we will pick it up when we can\u201d\n\nYeah, that's not going to work for me and when Kevin and Karen walk off, I turned to my neighbor and asked him to help me carry the damn cat tower back down to the curb.\n\nA little while later I had to run an errand and when I got back the stupid cat tower was back on my porch. Y'all...What...The...Absolute...Stupid...Hell!\n\nMy kid (F19) got back from class a little while later and asked why the cat tower is back on the porch. I told her the story, she rolled her eyes and groaned and I went back to work. About 30 minutes later she came into my office laughing.\n\nMe: What did you do?\n\nMK: Took the cat tower back down to the curb.\n\nMe: How, that thing is heavy as hell.\n\nMK: It was really easy once I took it apart and put all the hardware in this ziploc bag that accidentally fell into the trash can with the used cat litter.\n\nSo if Kevin and Karen want the cat tower, it's still available. But they will have to go dumpster diving for the hardware.",

Make sure DH is around to hear me complain.\n\n2. Find new, prettier cat trees in internet. Text DH photos, leave print outs in obvious places. Show pictures to feline overlords. They ignore me and continue to stare at treats closet.\n\n3. Give up because DH is too busy to care about said cat tree so purchase new stupidly expensive cat tree for feline overlords.\n\n4. Build stupidly expensive cat tree, swear loudly and vow this is the last time I am doing this. (It won\u2019t be).\n\n5. Place new cat tree in favored location. Feline overlords ignore new cat tree, while climbing old cat tree they discover ability to get on top of mantel. Destruction ensues.\n\n6. Spray new cat tree with cat nip spray, feline overlords laugh at my petty efforts.\n\n7. Hide favorite treats in new cat tower; overlords are intrigued, search and eat treats, return to old cat tree.\n\n8. Gather entire family together to lure overlords into the kitchen with promises of tuna. Give overlords tuna because I\u2019m not stupid and overlords are petty assholes who will vomit in my shoes.\n\n9. Quickly shut overlords into kitchen and then drag old cat tower outside. Overlords released, oldest and pettiest overlord climbs to top of new cat tree and proceeds to hiss and growl at anyone human or feline who comes near tower. Balance is now restored.\n\nFor at least 6 months until they destroy this one.",

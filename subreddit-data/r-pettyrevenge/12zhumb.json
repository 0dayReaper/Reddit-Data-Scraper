    "postText": "This is my Dad's story. It takes place in the early 1980s\nPicture this: early 1980s the DC, Maryland, Virginia area (DMV) a blizzard dumps a historically high amount of snow(several feet). My parents had just gotten married and lived in an apartment. My father spends hours digging his car out so he could get to work the next Monday. He gets home from work late and there is a car in his spot (assigned spot). My dad is pissed because now he has to dig out another space, in the cold dark. He notices the car was unlocked so with every shovel full he walks to the car opens the door and places the snow in the spot stealers car. This took him a few hours went home and slept s like a baby. The car was still there when he left for work the next morning. When he got home that evening the original space was empty and that was that. No neighbors complained or asked questions. \nMy Dad is the most gentle and kind man in the world but he also had 4 brothers so he doesn't take bullshit.",

Once you shovel out a spot, it's yours. You mark your territory with an old kitchen chair, a milk crate, or some junk. No one else had better remove your marker or park there. The offending car would be trashed. It's now limited to 48 hours, but I would still hesitate.",

I remember this because the snow was level with the porch (disguising the big drop FROM said porch) and the fact that my husband and our neighbor both told me I'd never make it out of the driveway with all the snow in my car, even with chains.\n\nMy dad was born and raised in Boise, ID.  It's pretty much desert around it; for people that don't know.  Also gets snow in the winter.  So he knew how to drive in the snow and he taught me as well, even though west of the Cascades in WA tends to rust instead of freeze.  First rule: drive the car you know.  The car in question was a 2007 Camry CE.  Manual tramsnission.\n\nThe looks of disbelief when I had no trouble getting the car out of the driveway OR out of our punchbowl of a neighborhood  were priceless.  My first two vehicles were also manuals, so I was surprised my husband had forgotten (also ended up rescuing my sister with my parents from work that year too, since I knew her Taurus- I was the one that gave itto her).\n\nAlways start in second gear.  And listen to your wife if she tells you she can drive in the snow.  She's probably right.  Even if *you* can't.\ud83d\ude04",

I would spend an hour shoveling my car out, then sit in the snow because my back was wrecked. Rinse and repeat, took me all day. My neighbors did the same, so at least we all had company.",

I dug out my space on the street in front of my house and was so pissed when I returned home to find someone in my spot. I seriously wanted to key their car, but the I refrained. A couple days later it was even worse. I had a small Saturn SC2. So I dug out only the front and enough to get in the door (the snow drift came up above and around the rest of the car creating a kind of igloo for the spot, only the right size for my car). When I got home, I easily backed my car into my spot, as my little snow shelter was still intact. After that, I found it comical, but stealing someone's shoveled space is a serious fighting offense in these areas. I'm from the south, and they're lucky carrying a shotgun was illegal in their fucking state...",

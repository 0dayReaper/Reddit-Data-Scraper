    "postText": "I have a bit of a problem with my parking lot.  The coop management refuses to stripe the walkway I use to get from the sidewalk to my car and the grass gets very soggy there. Long story how we got to this odd position but there is only room enough for half a sidewalk so instead the car on the end gets an extra wide parking spot.\n\nNow it has been only half a walkway at the point the sidewalk meets the parking lot since at least the 70s, it gets wider after this point but management does not want to admit they screwed up in the parking lot so no markings now. Anyways, one neighbor decided to take over that parking spot from her next door neighbor who had gone into care. She always parked so that there was absolutely no walkway left because she said it was her right.  With the soggy grass on either side of the sidewalk, i choose to balance on the curb walking past her car.\n\nEvery time i walked passed that car, i folded her mirror in just to inconvenience her. I hate to report to management any of my neighbors but i made an exception. I called, reported the problem and she wasn't allowed to park there anymore.",

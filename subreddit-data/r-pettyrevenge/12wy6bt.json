    "postText": "This is really petty and not recent at all, but considering I'm not in the area anymore and time has passed, I thought i'd share it.\n\nI was badly bullied in secondary school. I was a chubby kid and the target of a lot of bullying for the year I was at this particular school, especially from one girl I'll call Laura.\n\nShe was beyond cruel. I won't go into detail but she and her friends made my life hell and I ended up suffering a nervous breakdown and having to leave that school.\n\nA few years ago or so I saw an ad for a beauty salon that was having a sale on nail treatments . I went onto the website and saw Laura's face on the frontage. I instantly felt my stomach drop having not seen her for years and decided that I was going to get some petty revenge.\n\nI made a second email with a generic fake name, Sarah, and left a review. I said something along the line that Laura was unprofessional, the nails were awful and I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend. I was a lot younger then and knew it felt petty, because it was, but I didn't care, it mostly felt good.\n\nI thought nothing more of it until a few days later a post from someone called Sarah came up on our local Facebook page. Turns out that Sarah was an ex-employee of Laura's who had not been treated well (no surprise) and had been accused of leaving the review as I had unknowingly used the same name.\n\nI guess this was the tipping point for Sarah and her post was a list of Laura's wrong doings, the abuse she had received working under her, the training and insurance the salon didn't have and staff not being paid properly. I honestly can't remember it all, there was a lot in there.\n\nMy eyes were wide reading it, she aired everything out and it must of taken a lot of courage. I felt terrible for Sarah but she didn't seem to care about the review, more wanted to get all this off her chest.\n\nI was anxious about the comments but it turns out a lot of people had been treated badly by Laura over the years and it became a story session of people airing their grievances. There were some comments that said they liked the beauty treatments they received but it was mostly negative.\n\nAdmin of the group removed the post but it had already been seen by a lot of people at that point and the damage had been done.\n\nLaura made her socials private and never publicly addressed anything that I saw. I know it's all silly and not particularly thrilling, her business didn't close, but it now has a negative reputation with some and if you ask locals for a good place to go they tend to point you in the direction of the beauty salon in the next village over and that's a little bit of petty revenge for me.\n\nTL;DR - I wrote a negative review about an old bully's beauty salon starting a wave of people coming forward to talk about their negative experiences with her resulting in a poor reputation for her business and customers going elsewhere.",

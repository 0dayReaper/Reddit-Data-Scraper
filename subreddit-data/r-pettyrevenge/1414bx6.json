    "postText": "so i(22f) and my boyfriend(23m) went to this AYCE sushi place two years ago. the food was great and we usually tip 15%+ so there were no complaints.\n\nwe decided to go again today. we walked in, was sat down, and ordered hot tea and started writing what we wanted for the AYCE.\n\nnow, before we arrived, we were looking at the menu online and skimmed and saw some one star reviews about the chef, who happens to be the owner. we didn't think much of it since our experience previously went well.\n\nwell, once the server dropped off hot tea to our table and picked up our sheet for the AYCE, she went over to the chef and spoke to him about something, and then he came right over and told us that he cannot serve us sushi and proceeded to take our menus.\n\nwe sat there confused, and he proceeded to say something among the lines of, \"I recognize your faces, you guys complained last time you were here.\" as i tried to explain that it's been two years since we were here, he just told us the tea is on the house and that was it.\n\nwe took our time drinking the tea and when we left, i had an idea. i ordered about 10 sushi entrees (specifically stuff that couldn't be put back) that was about $180 online and set it up for takeout. i also added that i'd tip 20% of it.\n\nit took them about 40 minutes to call us to tell us our sushi was ready. we gave them a \"Quick question, is the tea on the house?\" and they hung up.\n\nhonestly, it'll probably just go to the other chefs and that one server(there was only one working that day), but it's still a loss in sale. i'm not a very confrontational person, so this was a huge win for me.\n\nanother note: we checked the reviews when we were home, and it turned out the chef was quite prejudiced against Asians, despite him being Asian himself. my boyfriend and i are also Asian, which is probably why he kicked us out for no reason.\n\nedit: the chef is chinese! another complaint on yelp follows: \"We were denied service for no reason today. They asked if we were *Korean* and then immediately told us to come again next time because they were busy. There were multiple tables open. I am so upset about this\"",

But when you order all the sushi you wanted they only bring you half of what you asked for and don't bring back the menu unless you ask. And even then they still only bring you some things you marked off. Sometimes different rolls even.",

And groups of five or more are subject to an 18% gratuity.\n\nNow, I love me some sushi and I get they're trying to reduce both their overhead and waste, but damn.",

However, what I hated is they charge for over ordering, but if you order say 5 types of rolls to begin with, they bring out a plate with all 5 rolls. Then maybe you only want to reorder your favorite roll - they just fill up the whole plate with the same roll, even if you ask them to bring a smaller volume. It gets to be hard work trying not to be charged - seriously why I stopped going!",

Everything is fresh, they are quick to serve and its all you can eat. And they have exceptional sushi and noodles. We nearly literally roll out of the restaurant so much we have eaten (and its not that we eat crazy amounts of food).\n\nBut come on.. I prefer to pay a bit more for good, fresh food with good service than garbage food against a kinda lower price (which would still be overpriced).",

Then when you look into the story, the booking wasn't cancelled because she's Asian. It was cancelled because last-minute she tried to change the booking to add two more guests and dogs and didn't want to pay any more despite the additional costs. But, despite everyone rushing to promote the story when it happened, similar fervor to add the missing context was not found. And it's been long enough I can't even find any of the correction stories you could find just a year after. \n\nSo, I could totally imagine the owner having too many years of \"Hey Uncle, we're Asian, too. What's the discount?\" wearing just a bit too much to the point that they would come to start hating Asian customers coming in and then extorting discounts just to leave a bad review when they don't get their way.",

    "postText": "Before I start, Its valuable to know I have ADHD and have always found it easier to type than write.\n\nSo, in secondary school, I had a cruel hearted hag of a spanish teacher. She overheard me say that I didnt want to take Spanish for GSCE and went off on me- it was like putting a red rag to a bull. She went off on me, saying (I kid you not) \"Do you know, there are children in the places of the world I've loved that would bite your arm off to be in the position you are, and so to throw your education into the dumps like that is so unbelievably arrogant and selfish\"\n\nSo theres a precursor as to wasnt she had it in for me. A few months later, She's checking homeworks, which she sets way more often that shes meant to, and I got fed up and just started typing. She comes to me and asks me how she doesnt know I put it through an internet translator, and I asked her how she knew the other students didnt cheat on it, and she said because they had written it down. I responded with \"They could also have put it through a translator and just written it down, that's how writing works\" and she SIGHED, Walked away, and said whatever. The f**king nerve to single me out and be obnoxious before walking away like its nothing? I didn't stand for it. I have type on diabetes, kind of giving me.a free pass out of lessons, so I ask her if I can go to the years 7-11 hub (kind of like a jack of all trades main office for those years) she says yes (she has to) but I never specified I had to go because of my blood sugar. I met with my head of year, and told her what happened. She got called out of teaching, we all spoke, another Spanish teacher found I didnt translate it literally because There were a few mistakes and some interpretations. I also asked her to find a software I could have used for that. She got backed into a corner and started looking guilty. The whole thing finished with me getting a spanish homework exemption, and her not being able to make my lessons a misery for fear of getting sacked. From every lesson 'til I stopped taking spanish to then, I always angelically beamed at her and if she asked what I was doing I always responded with \"I'm just happy, ms. Is there a problem?\"\n\nThe hag got what she deserved after she got fired for \"squeaky business\" with another teacher in the staff room laboratory. \n\nGood riddance to bad rubbish.\n\n\nTLDR: Spanish teacher made my life a misery, accused me.of cheating on homeworks, I proved her wrong, and eventually she got fired for  doing the deed in a toilet wit another teacher.",

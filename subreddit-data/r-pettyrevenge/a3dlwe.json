    "postText": "A few years ago I was heading to class to take a final in my music history class and forgot a scantron. I stopped by the college book store, grabbed a scantron and ran up to the counter. This is when I met \"her\". \"Her\" was a mid 50s woman with wrinkles on her face that can only come with holding a constant scowl on your face for decades. When I pulled out my card she pointed to a sign that said $10 minimum. Yes $10. The scantron was about 20 cents. I can totally get a $5 minimum, but 10? Come on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I didn't have any change in my pocket, but, there was a take a penny leave a penny jar. So I reached over and grabbed a couple of dimes someone was kind enough to leave. \"Her\" put her hand over the jar and said you can leave change but you can't take change. At this point I figured I could either get really upset or play the game she wanted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told her I understood and that there where a few more items I still needed. I proceeded to go the the furthest corners of the store and pick up about $200 worth of small items from the highest, lowest, and most inconvenient spots in the store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI walked up to the counter with my basket, the entire time \"Her\" had a wicked smile on her face like she'd won. Whelp, as soon as I signed for the items I told her \"I'd like to return everything but the scantron please\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was livid! People don't usually yell at me, but she completely lost it. She ended up calling campus police and the other workers. When the campus police arrived they informed her that what I did was completely legal. \"Her\" couldn't handle it but had to refund me for everything but the scantron. The campus police told me with a smirk to please not do that again. I said yes sir and headed to my final.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was about 20 min late for the final but ended up making an A.",

There's a little Mobil gas station near me that has one of those empty giant cheese ball containers with the label taken off and a written  \"tips\" sign taped on it and placed right next to the register and the card reader. Meanwhile across the street from them is a Sunoco, and the cashiers there tell me they aren't allowed to do that. \n\n\nI've never once tipped the Mobil clerks, though, it just seems weird to me.  But I have seen change and a few ones in their 'tip jar' every once in a while. \n\n ",

Some of the family owned stations will have teenagers working who go well above and beyond, when I pull in they ask me how much and what kind, start the pump, take the window washer and proceed to wipe my front and back windshield and any other window that looks a little scuzzy. I always tell them they don't have to do that but they always say something like \"Nah, it's what we do\" and I always throw them an extra buck or 2. One time in a dude opened a fresh pack of sour straws and offered me and my girlfriend some to which I took a few and thanked him.\n\nSome people are just good dudes",

For stores maybe, but the book store Nazis will get you. \n\nMy worst memory from working there for the month that I did (before I figured out that the part time position they hired me for had an unwritten seasonal under it) involved my counting my drawer. Generally on top of each register were a couple pennies, maybe a nickle. Just change that we would find around the store or register area that would get tossed up there. Well I was closing and needed to close out my register. When I went to pull the drawer she told me to toss the 15 cents in loose change on top into it. I was 15 cents over, and got questioned by the general manager the next day over how I could possibly have miss-counted change given to customers. No one seemed to believe that it was that manager making me put other people's change in there.",

A merchant required a minimum purchase amount in order for me to use my Visa card. Is this allowed?\n\n&gt; A. In general, a merchant is not permitted to establish a minimum or maximum amount for a Visa transaction. However, exceptions apply in the U.S. and U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. In those locations and only for credit cards, a merchant may require a minimum transaction amount of US $10 and government agencies and education merchants may establish a maximum transaction amount. If a merchant refused to accept your Visa card on the basis that the merchant requires a minimum or maximum amount on a Visa debit card, or the amount on a credit card is greater than US $10, please notify your Visa card issuer.",

My anecdote comes recently from the University of Washington, which required us to buy and bring full-page and apparently custom-made scantron sheets.\n\nI always showed up to exams with like 3 extra sheets, extra #2 wood pencils too. Somebody always forgets it's exam day and doesn't bring their stuff, like clockwork. Often the TAs etc would have a few extras also, but some times they wouldn't. As an upperclassman taking a 100 or 200-level elective that I didn't actually care about it isn't some sort of heroic act; it's just basic leadership. Sure, fuck the system for nickeling and diming us over cheap paper, but what I'm actually pissed about is the stress and very real jeopardy it puts somebody in if they forget. Ain't no college student got time in their life for that level of steaming bullshit. I probably handed out an extra maybe 50% of the time, usually to somebody in a full lizard brain panic response.\n\nAnd because I'm a firm believer in putting your oxygen mask on yourself before helping others, I always brought my emergency exam kit every day, just in case I was the idiot who forgot it was exam day.",

Homework consisted of going to watch the school choir and the final was basically \u201clisten to this song and tell me what it is.\u201d \n\nMusic history and jazz history were probably my favorite classes I ever took.

    "postText": "I was leaving Costco today when I saw the guy in the spot next to me push his cart against the curb between our cars and get into the driver's seat. The cart stall was only three spots away. I got his attention, pointed at this cart, and told him \"you forgot to put your cart away\". He told me to fuck off and put it away myself if I was so worried about it. It was then that I noticed his phone sitting on his car's roof above him. I decided to do what he said so I got in my car and fucked off. As I pulled away he was backing out, so I can only assume his phone slid off and smashed onto the ground. If he had just put his cart away there's a good chance he would've caught his own mistake.",

Now I was 60+ but still fit so ran back to the car, always keep change in the \"Hole\" grabbed a handfull &amp; gave it to him, Ken, thanked me, as I use the same place often, I would see him. then one day i did not see him, saw a \"manager\" asked him what had happened, sadly went to sleep &amp; never woke up. I stood there &amp; had to wipe my eyes, asked about his wife, no she had passed on, about 10 years earlier, thats when he told me he had kept Ken on, was always there at 07:00 finished at 18:00 was only paied for 7 hrs. I told him what had happened &amp; what a great guy he was. I wiped my eyes &amp; thats when I looked at him, he was wiping his eyes. One of the sadest times in my life. We looked at each other, offered my hand, he gave it gently shake &amp; walked away wiping his eyes. I still do the same, put the trolly in the bay, always think of Ken in ever shopping centre, when I see an elderly guy I give him a little form the hidy hols in the car. Sorry for the long story.

Learning and internalizing things is a skill that you very clearly seem to have, and I'm open to answering if you have more questions.\n\nBe gentle with yourself. You seem like a good person who cares about other people, and unless you're truly using \"stupid\" neutrally and not as an insult, you deserve better than the way it can slowly chip away at your self-image.\n\nMaybe I'm taking this way too seriously, but I guess I just... want people to be kind to themselves and worry if it seems like they're not. Especially seeing your username, for what it's worth, fat bald people are absolutely not ugly to everyone, certainly not to me and many of my friends. If I'm being way too serious after all though, feel free to ignore my comment.\n\nEither way I hope you have a good day/night, reddit stranger!",

Personally, I\u2019m going to judge the fuck out of the asshole talking shit to the lady who didn\u2019t put her cart back because she had 2 kids with her and wasn\u2019t going to leave them alone for any length of time because OMG the internet is judging people for it.

I am inmy 40's and getting a cane with a seat to sit down because standing in line hurts too much. The only reason I can say I always put the cart away is because there is someone with me to put it away if I really need to sit down.

If you have a physical condition which makes it impossible to get the cart more than a few feet away and you cannot park in a handicap spot, then park right next to a corral, close enough for you to get it there. Otherwise, sorry, but I'm going to judge.\n\nBy the way, my judgments are internal.... I would not approach someone rudely about it... I do sometimes offer to take the cart for them if they appear to be struggling (young kid in carseat, obvious difficulty moving).",

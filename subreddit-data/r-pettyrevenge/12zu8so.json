    "postText": "Years ago I lived in a very nice condo with ground floor access to the backyard of the condo which opened up into a large field and park setting with pathways throughout. When I lived there I had two dogs, Smokey and the Bandit, who were two large lovable fluffballs. I used to walk them all around the area and always picked up after them. \n\nNext door was \u201cKaren\u201d and her husband \u201cKen\u201d. Ken was an ok guy, never had any issues with him, but OMG Karen was a bitch and a half on her best days. As soon as I met them I sensed a hate for me coming from her but I never gave her any reason so I just ignored her. \n\nThat is, until she decided to appoint herself the Doggy Doodoo police and constantly accuse me of not picking up after my dogs. She would scream out her door at me about it when I was returning to my unit. I had zero clue what made her think this about me, like I said I always picked up after my dogs, so again I just ignored her and wrote her off as delusional. Doing so must have pissed her off even more because she started stepping up her attacks on me until it got to the point one day she confronted me outside the condo and was literally in my face screaming. I tried to verbally defend myself but ended up just walking away, going into my condo, telling her to go F herself and slamming the door in her face. She then proceeded to freak out including trying to kick my door in! I called the cops who luckily got there quickly and took control of her. In the end I could have pressed charges against her but I just wanted her to leave me alone so on that condition the cops let her go and THANK GOD she left me alone after that. \n\nNot long after that Ken told me they had bought a house and would be moving. I cannot tell you how happy and relieved I was hearing that. Karen obviously had a very hard time with self control and I was worried it would just be a matter of time before she got in my face again. When they finally left I had a little party to celebrate that night!\n\nThe next day I noticed some garbage in what would have been their \u201cbackyard\u201d, pieces of paper and stuff, nothing major or gross, so I picked it up thinking how ironic it was that I was picking up after them after Karen has spent so much time accusing me of not picking up after my dogs. LOL\n\nOne of the pieces of paper was Petty Revenge Gold\u2026it was something about their new house and had the address listed on it. Mwahahahahahahaha! I tucked that paper away for future reference while formulating my revenge plan.\n\nAbout six months later it was spring time. The time when people are planting seeds and flowers and doing lots of yard work. I talked to a friend of mine who agreed to help me exact my revenge and got the ball rolling.\n\nNorth of the big city that I lived in was where they had moved to. Also north of the city were lots of landscaping supply stores and farms where you could order things like sand, gravel, manure, etc. I called one of the farms that I assumed wouldn\u2019t be up to date in all the technological advances when it comes to paying by credit card for stuff and ordered 5 cubic yards of manure for around $100. For those of you who do not know, that is a LOT of manure which is delivered via dump truck and dumped in your driveway. I gave their address for delivery using my friend\u2019s credit card so there would be no link to my name (I reimbursed my friend) and requested an early morning delivery during the week and for it to be dumped at the end of the driveway closest to the road. I was hoping they wouldn\u2019t be home when it was delivered so it could sit all day and get nice and ripe in the sun waiting for them to return home at the end of the day. I imagined them coming home, hopefully tired AF, being blocked from parking in their driveway and having to deal with the pile which would mean having to shovel it all somewhere. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how it turned out. My friend and I were going to drive up there and stake their place out just to see their reactions but ended up not bothering. Regardless I got a LOT of satisfaction knowing that they finally would have to deal with my bullshit after me having to deal with theirs. HA!",

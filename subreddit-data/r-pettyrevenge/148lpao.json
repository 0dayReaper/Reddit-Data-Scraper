    "postText": "TW: Brief mention of Eating Disorders \nSpoilers for a like 15+ years old book? I mention the name before the spoiler so you\u2019ve been warned lol\n\nI was talking to a friend the other day and she mentioned the phrase \u2018People won\u2019t always remember what you said but they\u2019ll remember how you made them feel\u2019 and it made me think of this petty revenge story, I don\u2019t remember all of the details but I sure as heck remember how that person made me feel.\n\nBackground: There was a girl I went to school with who was honestly just the worst. She thought she was the smartest person to grace this planet (we went had all the same, very small k-12 classes together, you knew everyone in every grade, so it was a pretty small pool to be the smartest in) and she made sure everyone knew it. \n\nTo be honest I was pretty underwhelming at maths/sciences but I excelled in English classes, which we sat next to each other in and if I got a higher grade than her on any work she would insist that was incorrect, that I was \u2018too dumb\u2019 to get a better grade than her and go to the teacher to talk(argue) for a better grade. She thought writing more words meant she was smarter, but she always failed to follow instructions (like if our teacher said write 2 -3 pages for an assignment, I wrote 2-3 pages and she\u2019d write 8-10). \n\nSo onto the main story: we were on a field trip, staying a few nights in a city and unfortunately I had to share a hotel room\nWith her and her mum (also thought her daughter was a gift to the world). One of these nights was the release of a new Harry Potter book and she was a really big fan, so her mum went and bought it for her. I was never into it tbh, I don\u2019t have hate for the series, it\u2019s just not my jam but to each their own. \n\nAnyways, the day before she had been particularly nasty to me, I was also very petit but I ate a lot as I participated in a very intensive sport (think working out / training before school for 2-3 hours then right back after school for another 3-4 and also longer on weekends, I was in a competitive level) so while I don\u2019t remember what exactly she said, think along the lines of anorexic/bulimic/you\u2019re so dumb jokes,  I remember feeling terrible, sick to my stomach that I could barely eat during the trip I was having such a bad time interacting with her and could not get away from her and I couldn\u2019t just call up one of my parents and go home cause we were a few hours away from home.\n\nWhile she was showering the next morning and her mother was out of the room, I grabbed her book and skimmed/ speed read the last 5 ish chapters. At this point in time she hadn\u2019t been able read very much and was only a few chapters in. The next time during that trip she made a rude comment I looked at her and said something along the lines of \u2018Spoiler, Dumbledore f*cking dies\u2019 and she stormed off, quite upset, to tell on me. I never did get in trouble, though her mom raged as well but the teachers were like you can\u2019t punish OP, they are not your child and they weren\u2019t fighting (school cared more about physical fighting than bullying at that time). My own mum knew she bullied me and disliked the other mum as well so I never got in trouble at home cause I usually ignored her best I could. \n\nI know it\u2019s not a big pay off or has a big \u2018aha! Got you!\u2019 Moment but I hope she remembers my petty revenge that day and how I made her feel every time she re-reads that book because I certainly remember how she made me feel during all our school years together. \n\nTLDR: Fellow student was mean / rude, so I ruined the newest HP novel by spoiling the ending the next time she was mean to me.\n\nEdit: wording lol",

We had almost zero interaction with one another, but she had some pretty strong opinions about everything she heard I said and did and no amount of asking her nicely to stop did anything. \n\nOrder of the Phoenix came out. Local B&amp;N threw a midnight madness party. I\u2019d gone to all of them, so of course I was lined up. I was much closer to the front than she was. I was inside, within the first 50; she was outside still waiting to get inside by the time I had my book in hand. I went outside near where she stood, dropped to the ground with all my stuff and proceeded to skim the back chapters. Everyone knew someone died, but not who. \n\nI find it. Look up at her with no expression on my face (she\u2019s fidgeting and staring at me because she wants to just rip the book out of my hands and read it) and ask her if she wants to know who died. She starts FREAKING out and yelling no. I get up, pick up my stuff, walk close to her, smirk, and tell her who it is. She LOST it. The best part for me was that no one else heard me. The two friends she was with just heard me say \u201cbye guys!\u201d as I started walking away. \n\nA few days later, people in our friend group were telling me I was an asshole for upsetting her by spoiling the entire book. I gave them my best confused look and asked what they meant. They told me she was upset that I told her who died. I denied like my life depended on it and insisted she must have heard someone else and thought it was me. That I looked but then just got up and went home. \n\nAfter this, she started just spreading lies and I had to handle that separately, but I know I spoiled that whole book for her that she waited HOURS for. \ud83d\ude08 schadenfreude",

She was reading while the others were in the water. I was in the boat with her (she was 14 or 15). She started to cry softly and put the book away to go jump in so nobody would see that so I knew something was real bad\u2026. But to their credit nobody spoiled it for me and I read it as soon as she was done.",

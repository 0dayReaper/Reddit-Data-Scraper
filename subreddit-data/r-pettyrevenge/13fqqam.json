    "postText": "I\u2019m a healthy looking 55 year old male but have a degenerative nerve disorder and Ataxia (balance issues) so have a very hard time walking. I pull into a handicap spot at the grocery store, put my placard up, and get myself out of the car. A very angry person about my age runs up to me screaming about how I\u2019m stealing a handicapped spot from someone who needs it. As he went on I pulled out my walker and started walking to the store as he continued making a scene. As I walked to the store a cop who just happened to be there asked what happened. I just told him some people don\u2019t get it and pointed to my walker and went about my business. About 30 minutes later I came out of the store and noticed the guy was getting a field sobriety test. I sat in my car and watched as he eventually got arrested. Maybe next time he\u2019ll keep his mouth shut.",

            "comment": "This reminds me of a fun story-- like 12 years ago, I took my 90 year old Nana to lunch. I parked my vehicle in the handicapped spot, used her placard, walked her inside and got her settled, then went back out to my vehicle to grab my oversized purse and a 'just because' gift I had bought her. As I'm walking back in, someone starts losing their mind about me being a \"lazy punk\" for parking there. I understood their incorrect assumption, as I was in my 20s and looked more like a teen. So I politely explained that it was for Nana who was inside. \n\nBut noooo. They said I could have dropped her off in front, then parked far away, then pick her up in front after we were done. But I couldn't just \"drop her off\", as she'd still need help getting to the table etc which would leave me blocking the entrance for at least ten minutes both times. I didn't bother explaining this because by then I had surmised that this person was simply determined to confront someone today, and I was hungry. I just said, \"well I used the placard legally, but feel free to call the cops so they can come all the way here and explain that to you again.\" They continued to yell more obscenities as I walked off. \n\nOn the way out, they were behind us. I made sure we took as long as possible blocking the exit for them. Sorry, but as you can see, Nana is handicapped! Then I loudly asked Nana if she wanted me to pull the car around to the door. She laughed and said \"no, honey, that makes no sense!\"",

They cannot walk, drive or do anything unaided. We had a good morning, then I drove into a Restaurant Carpark for lunch and, pulled into a disabled slot near the door.\n\nNext, I open the back door and deploy the hydraulic lift, (a platform about 5 feet long), climb into the back of the van and start to take off the straps securing the occupied wheelchair.\n\nWhilst doing this, some moon-faced jobsworth taps on the window and asks \"Are you entitled to use this space?\" I refused to offer any explanation beyond pointing to the wheelchair and asking \"Well what do you think?\"\n\nSeriously, what goes through the spongy mass these people use for brains?",

My dad's friend was driving with my dad late at night through a neighboring town and there are no cars around. His friend drives through a red light, and another, and as they approach the 3rd, my dad asked if he was going to stop for the red lights. The friend slammed on the brakes going \"The lights were red!?!\" Dad suddenly remembered his friend is colorblind and they realized someone had installed the lights backwards on that street. Since he had been relying on the position of the lights to determine what color they were, he thought the lights had been green. Thankfully it was late enough and small enough of a town that no one had been around to cause an accident.",

I get her in the car, groceries and walker in the trunk and return the shopping cart to the cart corral.  Mr. Douche, also at the corral,  asks \u201care you handicapped?\u201d I tell him I\u2019m not and then jumped up and down, did a jumping jack,  skipped, then walked backwards to my car. He gets out his phone and starts videoing me all the way back to my car.  I go to the passenger side, open the door and tell my 85 year old mother to say hello.  Mr. Douche didn\u2019t apologize but I know I made his overly-righteous self to feel like the jerk he was. Sad to say I\u2019ve had several encounters like this because people don\u2019t realize you can have a placard and not a permanent rear plate.",

There was a pair of hawks that nested in the trees around one of the dorms and they\u2019d chill on the fence posts nearby the doors for some reason. People often thought they were carvings or fake because of how calm they were about college kids bustling by. Song birds would land right next to your head if you stood near a tree. It always freaked out the freshmen. There were many rumors about cults or magic that tried to explain the weird fearless animals.\n\nIt seems really amazing you can give that kind of vibe all by yourself. Keep on being awesome.",

When we moved to another state for better access to the care she needed, our apartment complex didn't have wheelchair access.  They made it work by putting a small ramp to the path that went to our backdoor and had a handicap parking sign with an additional sign that said \"Apt #123 only, all others will be towed.\"\n\nWe literally could not get her into our home if someone parked in that spot.  She was 2 then, but her wheelchair, ventilator, oxygen, and the rest of her gear was over 100 lbs extra, much of which *had* to be attached to her.\n\nI'm astounded by how many times I was harassed for parking in our spot, including some when my little girl was with me.  (We had to park there whether or not she was with us because she easily could be the next time.)  \n\nI'm also astounded by how many times I had to ask someone not to park there.  Only one had a placard; I explained why it was specifically reserved and they moved.  We had the authority to call the tow company if the office wasn't open, but as I lived next to these people, I did try to be nice first.\n\nOnly ever had to call the tow company once.  Zero guilt.",

Two were van accessible.  \n\nPeople liked to use these spots to pull through at pickup and get out of the parking lots faster.  Except I needed to use them to pick up my disabled daughter and load her, her wheelchair, and the all her heavy, attached medical equipment into the car.\n\nMy daughter was the only student with handicapped plates one year; the next, she was one of two.  The other girl's mother stayed with her at school to help with medical needs, but knowing if I was picking up my daughter, she was having breathing issues, she always parked in the less convenient of the two spaces.\n\nOne of the people using the van accessible space (where the stripes are) had a placard, but was using it incorrectly.  None of the others did.  Misuse was so rampant that the principal had given up on sending out information not to do that and just called local non-emergency police.  Their station was almost directly across the street and their response time was faster than school pick-up. \n\nEventually, the school had cement barriers placed to block using the handicapped spaces to pull through.  Solved the problem completely.  My daughter passed away later that year.  Her baby sister goes to that school now and likes to ninja climb the barriers.  I let her because it makes me smile remembering why those are there.",

But she wanted to drive, wanted to go out for margaritas, go shopping, everything healthy people take for granted because it's so easy. She knew she was headed for a wheelchair soon enough.\n\nMany, many times we would go somewhere and people would be in the handicap spots, making it harder for her. Like walking a heck of a lot further and struggle. It's better these days that it was then, and handicapped spots are more respected, I believe.\n\nRIP Christy, you were so patient and strong.\n\nPoint being, I care because I saw her struggling, and I've known handicapped people since then.

I took an exit at around 1am because I had to pee and let my dog do the same. \n\nI noticed a sedan in my rear view really accelerating up on me right as I got onto the exit. He ROARED up to me and I slightly moved the left while he swerved around me and clipped his mirror on an orange barricade. (Idk the term but the big barrels, not the cones). \n\nThis fucker then SLAMS on his brakes in front of me, which threw my dog forwards. He was clipped to his harness and seatbelt, but still. \n\nAll the stuff, bags and crate in the backseat flew forwards and I was scared and pissed off. \n\n\nThis fucker storms up to my window and demands I get out of the car, he\u2019s calling the police. \n\n\nI tell him to go fuck himself, I\u2019m staying put and put my knife in my lap where he could see because he had his FINGERS IN THE CRACK OF MY WINDOW PULLING ON IT. \n\nThat made him back down a bit. The stench of sweat and beer rolled through the car from the crack. I laid on the horn and my dog just barking up a storm until he backed off. \n\nI still had to piss. Badly. \n\n\nThis guy sits in his car and obnoxiously calls the police. We wait about 45 minutes until a trooper arrives. \n\nHe comes to my car, I get out to speak because my dog is losing his mind. \n\n\nI wrote down my statement, including that my car NEVER TOUCHED his, he sped up on me and swerved into the barricade. And he stunk of beer. \n\n\nOfficer went back and talked to the guy. Looked like a 55 year old trucker type guy with the beard and belly. \n\nCame back, told me I was free to go, have a nice night while dipshit is yelling in the back. \n\n\n\nGet to the gas station I had been eying for about an hour and barely made it to the toilet. Sweet sweet relief. \n\n\nAs I\u2019m letting my dog relieve himself afterwards\u2026. I can see down the exit ramp.  \n\n\nAnother officer is there. \n\n\n\nI start laughing and pointing, loudly.  \n\n\nFucker was being given a field sobriety test. If it wasn\u2019t 2AM+ and I still had 10 hours to go, I\u2019d have parked and watched. \n\n\n\nOmg the instant karma was delicious. \n\nI almost wish I had pushed for him basically illegally keeping me in one place\u2026. But that juicy DUI he CALLED IN ON HIMSELF is very nice.\n\n\nNot even sure what sub to post that on. Entitled people?\n\n\n\n\n**ETA;** the reason he stopped me was because he blamed me for \u201ccoming out of nowhere and cutting onto the exit in front of him\u201d.  So naturally his mirror missing was my fault. \n\n\nNo sir. I had signaled and already started onto the exit ramp when sweaty drunk dipshit sped up on me. I believe he didn\u2019t see me but only because he was clearly drunk.",

His wife was sitting in the car two spots away looking so proud that he was doing this.\n\nI let him rant and rave getting all red in the face while my teen son calmed the toddler in the car. I mentally asked myself if I should go off on him or not?\n\nUnexpectedly, a cop walked up asking what the problem was. The guy started going on about me illegally parking, neglecting my child who was continuously crying &amp; screaming &amp; that I need to be arrested. His wife chimed in that she saw the whole thing.\n\nThen the cop asked me \"What happened?\" I told him. \"I parked, started to get the baby out of the car and this guy came up; he's been yelling at me and my kids until you got here.\"\n\n\"Do you have a handicapped placard &amp; paperwork?\" \n\n\"Yes I do.\" Then the cop asked for it, as I started to get in my car to get it, that guy decided HE WAS ENTITLED to see it as well!!! \n\nThe cop asked him to return to his car. The guy said he had a right to know if I was breaking the law. The cop says \"Actually, no you don't. That paperwork she has has her personal information on it including medical information. If you were to see that, and follow her home and kill her; I'd be held liable and you'd go to jail for a hate crime. Including your wife.\"\n\nI didn't think someone could turn the shade of red he did but I found out that it's possible. But he walked back to his car.\n\nI showed the cop my paperwork. And he asked if I minded telling him exactly what it was for so I told him. I've had one surgery on my lower lumbar of my spine L5-S1 with pinched nerves and I'm about to have another more invasive surgery for the same area. I can't walk too long or too far or my leg gives out.\n\nHe said \"ok. Thank you.\" Handed back my paperwork and started to walk off.\n\nA lady and her kids walk up and talk to the cop. Tell him what that guy *really* did &amp; said &amp; why my kid was crying. He smiled &amp; says \"ok. Thank you.\"\n\nWalks over to the guys car. I hear the guy yelling and I look as we're getting the baby back out.\n\nThe cop wrote him a ticket! I'm not sure what for though! \ud83d\ude02 I hope it was for something petty!",

The other handicap spot is better marked. One day a black guy, a woman, and a guy I call \u201cgun guy\u201d come in at the same time. I serve the black man then the woman while my coworker serves gun guy. The second the customers I serve left gun guy gets this weird smile in his face and is talking about how the black guy parked in the handicap spot. I know this guy is crazy alt right and likely racist. I also know he\u2019s talked about wish he had his concealed on him to shoot someone for apologizing. I distract him. He can\u2019t not have the last word so I keep talking to him. Give the black guy enough time to leave. After hes gone I tell my coworker about things gun guy as said before and the scary vibes he gives me. He agreed it was probably a good idea to distract him like that",

They didn't think she was disabled and they wanted the spot, which happened to be in front of the store, as they were both really big. A local PD happened to be driving by, stopped and asked what was wrong. My wife just told him they started yelling at her, showed him her permanent disabled card and went on her way.

You may as well just park in a regular spot and hope for the best. \n\n\nI will also say, something that really sucks is going someplace big like the grocery store that has a fair amount of handicapped spaces, and having them all taken. And i can't help but wonder if at least one of those people is in as bad a shape as I'm in or could've been okay in a regular spot. Like, I REALLY need those spots bc of how hard waking distances is for me. I don't like to assume people's needs, and I'm sure they have valid reasons for the spot as well.

He can get a permanent license plate for himself plus a portable placard tu use when riding with you or someone else.\n\nThe longer he is taking care of his own needs, the longer his brain will remain sharp, his quality of life will be higher, and very likely he'll live longer.\n\nIf he's hesitant, point out that he's still free to park in a regular parking space.  Some people only park in handicap spots on their bad days, and regular spots on their good days.  It's nice to have the option when you need it.",

    "postText": "I guess this belongs here. \n\nBack story: I dated a girl from 2008 - 2016 when we got married in May. Things were amazing, almost never fought, had the same goals, interests, everything. She\u2019d always been a bit of a \u201ctruth stretcher\u201d but nothing too serious. Usually just to make herself look better to others. Her best friend would comment on it to me, but we both blew it off because it wasn\u2019t ever Ill intentioned. She also always had to be the center of attention. Literally refused to play Mario Party if she wasn\u2019t Mario, and would throw a fit. Absolute minor things really. \nWell, in the span of a year her mom died, she got off antidepressants (used for allergies, but she didn\u2019t know they were anti depressants) we got engaged, she moved two hours away for work for 3mo and we started wedding planning. \nThen she gets a new job for a guy that only hired young women (17-23) who was just divorced by his wife for cheating. \nWell, marriage is tough, choices have to be made financially and she was told No for the first time in her life and he promised her the world and within 3mo of getting married she had already cheated. I tried to save it (shouldn\u2019t have even tried) but it was over. \n\nThe Revenge: all of her stuff was in my house. Clothes, furniture, everything. She left with the clothes on her back and a handful of other things. Lied about moving in with him, lied about going out of the country, lied about not having him over to our house. \nI got everything that wasn\u2019t explicitly hers. She had to provide a list, I had to approve, and she would let me know the exact day and time to pick up her stuff, and she was only allowed to bring her dad to help. \nSo, I threw all of her stuff in my sun room, safe from the weather. You can get to it 2 ways, through the side yard to a back door, or through the middle of the house. \nIt was during the time of year it usually rains in the evening, tonight was no exception. When she arrived with her dad all of her stuff was laid out in piles in the sunroom, but I made sure all of her sex toys and outfits were on top. \nPetty revenge? Yes, but that\u2019s not all. \nRemember, there\u2019s 2 ways to get to the room, it\u2019s raining outside, so going through the yard sucks, but coming through the house had a catch too. That same night I decided to through a little party. I invited all the people that told her she was an idiot for doing what she did. \nSome of the guest included her (now former) best friend and maid of honor, 2 other brides maids, 4 other close friends, and a police officer to make sure it all went smoothly. We had a very lovely dinner watching the show. \nShe did complain to her lawyer but was told tough shit. \nNow, faced with walking your stuff through the rain or walking through all your close friends, which would you choose? She chose the rain. \n\nEdit to add: forgot the second part, it\u2019s early, meant to add at the end. His ex contacted me because she didn\u2019t know if I knew they were cheating. \nOne thing led to another and one night we hooked up. She was very pretty and very good. We ended things because we both thought it was just too weird. \n\nTL:DR I made my ex chose between walking her stuff through the rain or facing her disapproving best friends, and made her pack her sex toys with her dad.",

    "postText": "So, when my brother and I were young, he was about 7 and I was 10, he found out that I was very easily scared. The slightest sudden noise could make me jump out of my skin and get a scream from me. This would usually manifest in him hiding behind things and popping out with a loud \u201cBoo!\u201d And he would get me every time. It got so bad that I was scared to even walk the halls of my house. After a couple years of this my parents stepped in and told him to cut it out. It definitely slowed down but he would do the occasional spook and get me.\n\nThat is until one fateful night in 2012. My family and I were big fans of Doctor Who and it had entered its sixth series and introduced a new monster: The Silence. For those who don\u2019t know, the Silence look like somewhat generic gray aliens in a nice three piece suit. The catch was that every time a character would look away from the alien, they\u2019d forget about it. So what the characters would do is put tally marks on their forearms and face when ever they see one. It was a very good idea for a monster and wonderfully executed in those first two episodes. \n\nDuring the second episode there\u2019s a character in an abandoned orphanage and she\u2019s looking out the window, lightning strikes and her face and arms are full of tally marks. It\u2019s a **very** good scare. So good in fact, that I notice my brother is acting uneasy. \n\nSo then I have an idea.\n\nA most horrible idea.\n\nA delightfully devilish idea.\n\n**A petty idea.**\n\nI ask my father to pause the episode \u2018cuz I needed to go the bathroom. I lied. I didn\u2019t need to go to the bathroom. I grabbed a sharpie and wrote a bunch of tally marks all over my face and arms. I was absolutely giddy. Then, with my game face on, I go back downstairs to the TV room. I turn on the lights, this makes my brother ask what was up and he turns his head to look at me.\n\nHe starts freaking the **fuck out.** Like he was back crawling towards our dad. My dad asks what\u2019s wrong, looks at my face, and starts laughing his ass off. I act like nothing happened and got closer to my brother, feigning concern. That freaked him out even more. After my dad and I had our laughs he told me to wash up. My brother couldn\u2019t continue the episode so he runs to his room. My dad calls my mom and tells her that I finally got one over my bro.\n\nNowadays there\u2019re no more pranks between me and my brother. He\u2019s graduating with his bachelors degree and is one of my groomsman in my wedding. He\u2019s a good man and I\u2019m very proud of him and I love him very much. \n\nTL;DR: Younger brother kept scaring me for no reason so I got him back good by emulating a show we were watching.\n\nEdit: Series 6 did not debut in 2012! Series 6 was 2011 haha oops.\n\nEdit 2: I did it mom. I\u2019m Reddit famous. Thank you kind stranger for the gold! I\u2019m very happy that so many people got a kick out of this dumb little prank I pulled on my baby brother 10+ years ago lol Thank you all so much :)",

I don\u2019t understand how this worked on the show. If the character immediately forgot seeing the aliens, how would they know what the tally marks meant? Wouldn\u2019t they just look at the marks all confused about their purpose instead of making new marks?",

So they already know that the tally marks means they have seen the aliens and they\u2019re potentially in the room. They can\u2019t remember what the monster looks like until they look at it again. It\u2019s a very creepy concept that I adore.",

That one of the reasons I was disappointed when I couldn't find it to watch again.\n\n(Dating myself here) I originally watched Doctor Who on Georgia Public TV back in the 1970s which started with the original Doctor and went through Tom Baker's Doctor. So re-watching the Classics was a flashback (in some ways literally, lol). It's too bad so many of the old episodes were lost - though some were kept by audio recordings and have been animated apparently.",

It was the Arachnids in the UK that made me realise I was going to tap out even though I watched a few more after that - the plot point where she prefers to let the spiders suffocate to death slowly and is utterly disgusted when Trump shoots one instead didn't make any sense to me, felt like \"guns bad\" without any nuance - and I say this as someone who's very much on the anti-gun side of the debate.\n\nI might check out the new Tennant episodes though, he's one of my favourite actors, particularly in that role.",

They comment to the other character,, while subtly moving to another room. Okay, safe! Glance at their arm... *three* marks. Crap. They look up at their companion... and they're *covered* in marks. Then they look *up...*\n\nIf you wanna see stuff in a similar vein? Look up 'False Hydra', which is a D&amp;D monster that takes this whole concept to 11.",

    "postText": "A few weeks ago I posted about an altercation with my neighbor(https://old.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/13dp3t6/petty_revenge_on_my_jerk_of_a_neighbor/), I thought I'd give an update.\n\nThe few days after the altercation, when I would come home and pull into the driveway the jerk would walk out front and watch me pull into my garage. After the third time I decided to let him taste his own medicine. I walk down to the curb and collect the mail, and as I am walking up I see Jerk staring at me, so I just stop and stare right back. After about 5 seconds of staring him down with a bemused look on my face he throws his hands up in the air like he is confused.. He yells over to me that 'I don't have a problem', and I respond with well you keep watching me go in and out of my house like you have something you want to say, and he says 'well yeah, you tore me a new asshole the other day', which might be true.\n\nSo I explain to him that the reason I am not willing to talk/work with him is because of how he treated us when we had to shovel snow, and that the only reason we had to shovel was because we were told he is the reason the snow removal service cancelled, due to the way he parks his truck. He says this is the first he is hearing of this, and that no one told him that his truck being parked there was an issue. At this point I get a little apologetic for my rude outburst a few days earlier, because if he doesn't know then I don't believe I can blame him.. He agrees to give me his phone number/email so that I can contact him regarding issues with the private drive, and says he is willing to move his car for snow removal. He does derail and go on a few tangents regarding the elderly neighbor, apparently they have been at each others throats since Jerk moved in, and he refuses to talk to the elderly neighbor. I explain that I'm not going to get in the middle of their squabbles, but from my perspective the elder neighbor is helpful, he helped shovel snow, and Jerk did not. In the end I told him I would take my yard waste a little further down like he initially asked.\n\nThe next day I contact the other neighbors, and explained that Jerk's stance is that he had no knowledge his truck was causing problems for the snow removal. The next day the elderly neighbor puts a photocopy of a receipt he sent to Jerk over a year ago in my mailbox, the receipt has a message for Jerk that says the snow removal service is complaining about his truck and they are threatening to cancel service. Which implies Jerk lied to me that he had no knowledge his truck was an issue. \n\nA week goes by and I get a rude text message from jerk. It accuses me of putting additional yard waste in the area I agreed not to, and he says I am doing it just to piss him off. I respond with 'Check your facts, I didn't put anything there'. He then does apologize for being rude and says it must be one of the other neighbors.\n\n\nThat brings me to today. The way I see it I should try to work with him and get along, but at the same time I am not going to let him take advantage of my or the other neighbors kindness. I believe in the iron rule, as long as he chooses to act like a Jerk he is going deal with a jerk.",

I hadn\u2019t thought of it quite like that and while I haven\u2019t been in that exact situation, it really made sense to me about communication types. Details might be wrong, situation itself was what stuck for me. I don\u2019t care. \n\nSomeone said that their mom was complaining about how she knew it was going to be a long day at work and she wasn\u2019t looking forward to doing doing the kitchen when she got home. The poster thought \u201cyeah, chores suck\u201d and just agreed.\n\nMom came home and the kitchen wasn\u2019t done, so she got pissed because she was actually hinting that *someone else* should have done it and got mad at the child (who was in high school iirc, not small child). \n\nPoster said that they weren\u2019t asked to do anything, and they didn\u2019t pick up the hint because doesn\u2019t everybody hate doing their chores and complains about them?\n\nBut yeah, I tend to say what I mean, I don\u2019t make a whole lot of untold subtext read between the lines or you\u2019re going to miss it type crap (that I think is bs). \n\nHusband DOES, however. So he puts all these words into my mouth that I never said or even thought of, and I don\u2019t pick up on all his hidden crap either. He is *by far* the more direct person, but he offsets that with weird subtext that I miss often enough to annoy him. \n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with OP\u2019s jerk, I think he\u2019s just a jerk that lies to his neighbours, but the communication thing is still a possibility.

            "comment": "There is a lot to unpack here, but I would like to offer two observations.\n\nMy first observation is, like it or not, this is someone whom you have to live with in close proximity. It's better for your family's safety and your own peace-of-mind to try to find a common ground. I realize this is not often easily done, but do what you can to be the bigger person here. I have had my own personal experience with an aggressive neighbor and it's far a better life to try to get along than the road of constant battles you seem to be headed down. I'm not saying you need to cave to every crazy demand, only to look to establish a common ground and work toward a more beneficial relationship from there. You would be surprised to see how easily you can convert a scenario like this to a beneficial one. (Unfortunately it's also true that some people are simply impossible to work with, which leads me to my second observation:\n\nThis person at first seems to be reluctant yet possibly a little open to some level of mutual cooperation. This leads me to believe that he is either putting on a tough act, but uncomfortable with that role or is subject to pressure from other members of his household, he might simply be 'in the middle' of his own family battle. Either way, try to take advantage of this and try to engage in some form of mutual one-on-one entertainment where he can feel 'listened to'. (Playing cards, throwing darts, etc.) I really feel like this is still salvageable.\n\nEither way, document, document, document. Get your property surveyed, remove any questions of boundaries, but try to be subtle about it. Pointing a camera in plain view right at his property is only going to aggravate the situation. Depending on where you live, and as a last resort, you may be forced to get some form of protective order and the more documentation you have the stronger your argument will be.",

I don't need to. You do. It's not a community need. It's a personal need.\n\nOn top of all of this once this fella found out that he needed to park somewhere else so you all could get the snow removed, he was super willing.\n\nYou sound like the kind of asshole that lives suburban, relocates rural, and wants to be bossy with people that have lived there longer than you. \n\nAlso classist bullshit with the \"you're a renter\" bullshit. If he is a renter and you're an owner, then clearing the drive is on owners. That means you, and landlord, not you and tenant.",

One is that he had a penchant for not thinking about how to go about home repairs or alterations.  He decided to dig in his yard one day, for example.  Thirty minutes later, our power went out, and a truck appeared in his yard a bit later.  He never checked where any of the mains were before digging, and he knocked right into a water pipe.  The power was turned off by the utility company to ensure no one accidentally fried, I guess.\n\nI poured a glass of wine and rubbernecked through our curtains, Mrs. Kravitz style, while he tried to explain to the water people what he did.\n\nDoofer was as Doofer did.\n\nLikewise, I see that Jerk is as Jerk does.",

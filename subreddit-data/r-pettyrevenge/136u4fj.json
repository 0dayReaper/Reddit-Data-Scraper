    "postText": "[Petty Printer Revenge](https://reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/136nh2s/petty_printer_revenge/) reminded me of my own printer revenge. \n\nI worked with a \u201cGary\u201d, who was a bit of a pain.  He was competent but obnoxious, slightly confrontational, knew more than you and was always willing to correct you. \n\nOne day he left the lunchroom before the rest of us.  A coworker said, \u201cI wonder if he knows what a bozo he is?\u201d  The tag stuck.  His nickname was BattleZone or BravoZulu for a while.  \n\nOne day when I\u2019d had enough bozo, I struck.  On Unix/Linux systems, print jobs go through a filter, usually a shell script.  I changed the script so that if the job was submitted by BattleZone, it reset the printer\u2019s status message to \u201c**BOZO ALERT**\u201d.  Any other job cleared the message.  \n\nI worked there another year, knowing that every time BattleZone went to the printer, the message said \u201c**BOZO ALERT**\u201d.",

            "comment": "Edit for TLDR:  senior coworker poaches two of my dudes. A series of petty events follow.\n\nI love petty IT revenge.  Our network had two factor authentication.   One of which was a physical card.  You were required to take the card out so no one could access your computer while you were gone.\n\nThis dude had poached two of my best from my team.  His seniority and ass kissing abilities allowed this damn travesty. \n\nOur petty team revenge was that my guys would call me when he left his card in.  I would go in via remote access and just mess with him.  \n\nChanged keywords in his auto correct, once I was feeling particularly salty and just changed 'the' to 'tle.'  \n\nI got two days (four briefs) of petty amusement out of that one.  \n\nOnce changed his email alert from the standard ping to [TIMMY!](https://youtube.com/shorts/EvlN3T1fMPk?feature=share).\n\nHe tried to complain to our boss about it.  I kept a perfectly straight face and told her that I couldn't even do that unless his card was left in the machine.   Lol.\n\nLeaving the card was an actual write up type of offense.   I almost broke out laughing; you could literally see him cycle through all the emotions on his face.  \n\nI just stood there,  no expression.  \n\nHe wouldn't admit to it, so couldn't prove I'd done it.   I topped it off with 'please submit a work ticket to get that fixed for you.'   Told our boss I'd make it a priority and would put it on the briefing slides to keep her updated.  \n\nThen I got to see him squirm in his seat while briefing our boss's boss that this high priority ticket had been solved so quickly.   \n\nOf course I took this opportunity to remind everyone (with a pointed look at TIMMY!) to please remove their keycards when leaving their office.  \n\nPretty much my favorite series if petty events ever.",

She  would do batches of 200's,  tie up the machine all day, and just leave paper jams.  I finally got sick of it, and the day we put in a new toner cartridge ( $250.00 for those), I set the toner to \n\" dark,\" switched the setting to \"landscape,\" switched the tray to oversized,  turned on the\n \" collate and staple\" feature, and put orange paper in the oversized tray.  \n\nThe next morning, first thing, she ran to the Xerox and programmed in another 100 batch, hit copy, and walked away.  Upon returning, she had 60' ish huge pages of orange with  black smears, collated and stapled in sets of 4.  Used the whole toner cartridge. \n\nThe office manager went ballistic on her. It was awesome.",

    "postText": "Years ago I lived in an apartment complex that consisted of 5-story buildings with a central main entrance in the front that had electronic access and outdoor stairwells at each end that had security doors on each floor that opened with a regular key.  Since I lived at the far end of the ground floor of my building I usually used the side door and the outdoor stairwell.  The ground floor was actually below ground level at the front of the building so when I entered the stairwell from the walkway, I'd go down a flight of stairs where the door to my hallway was to the right and a small concrete alcove was to the left (under the stairs leading to the floor above mine.  Between work, classes, and walking my dog I used this entrance multiple times each day for the 4 years I lived there.\n\nNow that I've set the scene, on to our story.\n\nAfter some time, someone started storing their bikes in the alcove at the bottom of the stairs.  Now, our lease stated that this wasn't allowed, but I figured it wasn't that big a deal so I let it go.  Then the owner of the bikes started locking them to the railing of the stairs.  Unfortunately, they always did it in such a way that one of the handlebars would stick through the railing and I regularly either whacked my foot on it or tripped over it when going up and down the stairs (the lighting wasn't great).  I notified the office, but since they didn't know who the bikes belonged to they couldn't do anything except send everyone in the building a letter reminding them of the rules.\n\nThen came the poop bags.  This was a pet-friendly complex, so a lot of residents had dogs.  Most of us did the responsible thing and picked up our dogs' poop with bags and tossed them in the trash.  Well someone decided that was too inconvenient so they started dropping their poop bags down the stairwell.  Every time I'd come home I'd see poop bags on and around the bikes, sometimes broken open with the contents spilled out.  On my way out I'd try to grab a few bags to toss them in the trash, but like the bikes, the office couldn't do anything about it since they didn't know who was responsible.\n\nWell one day the poop hit the fan...or, rather, the bike.  Apparently one of the poop bags broke open and one of the bikes ended up with dog poop on the seat.  Did our resident bike owner clean up all the poop bags?  Did they finally move their bike?  If your answer was yes to either of those questions, you're sadly incorrect.\n\nOur deeply offended cyclist decided that the appropriate reaction to this incident was to take the dog poop and smear it all over the door and doorknob of the ground floor entrance, including mashing it into the door lock.  How do I know it was the owner of the bike?  He left a note.  With his name.  And apartment number.  No, I'm not kidding.  Taped to the door was a note calling out the person who defiled his bike and inviting them to deal with \"Nick in 405\" personally if they had a problem with him.  I discovered this mess when I came home from work one night, luckily before touching it or attempting to insert my key in the lock.  After standing there for a few minutes, dumbfounded, I took several pictures of the note, door, lock, and bikes before leaving the stairwell to use a different entrance.  I called the office the next day to tell them about the incident and notify them of the pictures I'd emailed.  The manager was as stunned as I was and initially responded, \"Are you serious?!\"  Then she opened the pictures.  \"Oh.  My.  God.  You ARE serious.  Who the hell does that?!\"\n\nWhen I got home that day, the door had been replaced.  Within a couple of weeks I saw a couple of guys unhappily and hurriedly moving furniture out of apartment 405 and tossing bags of clothes off the balcony to a pile of belongings on the lawn.  Nick, the next time you throw poop, don't stand downwind.",

Anyway, someone had gotten big globs of shit all over the stall. Not just the floor, but the walls too. Like around 5-6ft up on the walls. All four walls at that. Naturally I pretended like I never saw it and some other poor bastard was stuck cleaning it up. Not particularly proud of myself for that, but if I'm honest, I'd probably do it again.\n\nMoral of the story is, there are some really fucked up people out there. Also, why couldn't the property manager just remove the bike and then leave a message for the owner that they can come pick it up at their office and have a nice chat about fire codes.",

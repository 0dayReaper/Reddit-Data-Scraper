I could literally hear it clearly in my sleeper!!! \ud83d\ude12 Couldn't sleep anyway, so... He learned the hard way on why not to cross an ex-emo armed with the knowledge of the heaviest metal and college dormitory experience. \ud83e\udd28 I blasted some heavy metal and opened my windows. It was like the Korean DMZ when they still had music and propaganda blasting at each other. \ud83d\udce2\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb6 Needless to say... He stopped, and I added an additional hour for good measure. \ud83d\ude0f",

If they're listening to right wing trash I will play music that makes my sound system barf rainbows.\n\nReefer in this context means refrigerated.  I haul perishable food.",

    "postText": "Natural revenge: Once, when I was a young teen, I was at summer camp and all the boys would take their fishing gear down to the lake during our afternoon down time. They all used rods and lures and gear they had brought with them. I am the daughter of a fisherman. I think I could fish before I could walk. lol We lived on the shore.\n\nWell, I found a broken piece of line one day floating in the weeds near the shore and it still had a hook and weight attached. So, I picked it out of the reeds, tied it to a stick, and went to get a left-over tuna sandwich from the lunch room. I made little balls from the sandwich and packed the hook. The boys all make fun of me and laughed. Told me I was ridiculous. That without a real rod I wouldn\u2019t be able to catch anything. That girls don't really know how to fish. Etc. I didn't say a word, just nodded and smiled.\n\nIn less than 5 minutes I had caught 4 perch. When I walked over to where the guys were all fishing, I asked them if they still wanted some fish, and tossed them down. I told them if they didn\u2019t want them to just throw them back into the water.\n\nThe best part... the next day, EVERY SINGLE boy out there had brought a tuna fish sandwich with him! I still laugh about that today!",

They become best friends as he learns to appreciate the wise- beyond- her -years little country girl.\n\nA heartwarming story. You tell it almost as well.",

Cheap white bread from the day-old section, a can of niblet corn, or if I had found enough coke bottles to return for the deposit (I'm old), a tub of Red Wigglers and I was a sunfish's worst nightmare.  Your addition of canned tuna and mayo makes it prime catfish bait!",

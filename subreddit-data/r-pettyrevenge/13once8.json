    "postText": "When I was young, I worked at the DMV in an attempt to crush my soul enough to join the corporate world.  \n  \nOne of the only joys of being in that place was the occasional funny or cool license plate that randomly showed up.  Our state had a basic 3+3 pattern: three random letters/numbers, followed by a space to allow the state logo to appear, then three more letters/numbers.   Every morning, I'd flip through the stack of plates on my station, looking for things like \"JMS BND\" or \"MTL ICA\" (not actual plates- although they're close to a couple I did hand out).  We all did.  Every time we found a really good one, it was the highlight of the day, something to share with co-workers and bring up at the dinner table when we got home that night.    \n  \nOne day, a dude made it to the front of the Queue of Misery just as I finished up with a customer.  I was about halfway down the line of stations, and yelled the standard \"I can help you down here!\" at him.  For some unknown reason, this pissed him off.  He walked up to the nearest station and yelled back \"Why can't you help me down here!\" and then spent approximately 3x the amount of time it would have taken to process his registration arguing with me about why I had to help him THERE instead of at my station.  Because apparently the long hike was just too much for him.  Eventually, for reasons I can't understand myself, I gave up and schlepped on over to where he was standing.  \n  \nHe was a total sourpuss the entire time, too.  Couldn't understand why it took me so long to get set up and log in.  Every question got a sarcastic response.  Like (but probably not actually- this was a while back) \"Are you a state resident?\" --&gt; \"Why the fuck would I be registering a car here if I weren't?\"  Yeah, I know the DMV is Hell's Antechamber, but you don't have to make it any worse than it actually is.  Did it make him feel manly to fuck with some random 19 year old girl whose job could have been done by a vending machine in the mall?  \n  \nSo as I'm filling in the form on that 1970s-era greenscreen terminal, I notice the next license plate on the stack.  It's a doozy.  For the life of me, I can't remember what it was exactly (there were so many silly ones. they all blend together.)  But I do remember that it was cool and almost naughty.  He sees it too.  He's standing there, staring at it like a kid about to get the biggest lollipop in the candy store.  \n  \nThe petty revenge:  So I make the briefest of eye contact, casually move the cool plate to the bottom of the stack, and key in the numbers &amp; letters from the boringly mundane next one.  I could almost see the gears turning in his head.  Does he complain? If he does, is he going to sound like a total baby because he didn't get the plate he wanted?  Am I going to charge him extra for a custom plate if he asks ME for it?  But no.  He just fumes silently as I finish up.  \n  \nI don't really remember walking out to his car to verify the VIN, but I like to think I strutted just a little.  \n  \ntl;dr: DMV customer acts like a total dick to me.  I give him a boring random license plate instead of the cool random license plate that was next on the stack of random license plates.",

She adores it and has transferred the number plate whenever she has bought a replacement car.\n\nIf the number plate has ever been issued and is not currently in use, you can buy it. Though the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority) will withdraw number plates that can cause problems or be considered offensive. For instance, quite a few years back, when that year's letter was V, they took a few weeks to figure out why so many people were trying to pre-register a plate with the registration V14 GRA.... Once the penny dropped they promptly withdrew that one!",

For decades the procedure was to fill out a registration application then go to an insurance agent and purchase a policy. Once the policy was purchased they would stamp the application with a rubber stamp and sign where it was stamped. Then you took that to the RMV office and pray that they didn't find any issues with all the paperwork. No rubber stamp? Denied. No signature with the stamp? Denied. Stamp or signature is smudged/blurred? Denied. Go back to your insurance company and complain to them.\n\nRenewals also required you to go get a new stamp from the insurance company on your renewal form...\n\nThis process worked reasonably well when virtually all insurance was provided through agents that had offices within the state. But with the proliferation of national insurance companies like Geico, Amica, USAA, etc. it became a nightmare as the RMV fought tooth and nail to remain in the stone age. They finally rolled out an \"electronic stamp\" system that these insurance companies could use, but until they got that working it was a major PITA to have insurance from one of these national carriers. For a long time MA simply didn't allow you to insure a car with them. It wasn't until something like 2009 that companies like Geico started offering insurance here.",

Too many posts go way beyond the type of content that this channel was intended to contain.  \n  \nI'm not sure what OP could have done that would go to the level shown in that little giffy.  The only thing I can think of is maybe they could have given the dick customer a plate that they knew would be rescinded later, causing the customer to have to make an additional trip to the DMV.  But that would require a plate of that nature to show up randomly in the mix.  Unlikely, at best.",

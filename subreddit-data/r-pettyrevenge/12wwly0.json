    "postText": "This happened about 10 years ago, but I think it fits. I went on a first day with a guy and naively let him pick me up. He seemed safe; he was established in the community as an attorney. Everything seemed fine at first. We went for dinner and drinks and had great conversation. As we got back into the car he starts undoing his pants, hint that he wants a blow job. I looked at him and asked what he thought he was doing. He tried to spout out some bullshit that he was full from dinner. I looked.him squarely in the eye and said, \"from want it's not like you just had Thanksgiving dinner, pull you pants up and take me home.\"\n\nShould I have gotten out of the car then, yes. Did I? No. So he tries to kiss me and I went with it to keep the peace. Seems like ol' boy got the message. Until he started going the wrong way back to my apartment complex. His hand found my thigh. Fine I thought because he started going the right way. We get back to my complex and he thought I was going to invite him up. I wasn't. Well then he starts kissing me again, which was okay. Until it wasn't because his hand was around my throat trying to choke me. As soon as I got free, adrenaline kicked in and I grabbed him by the throat as hard as I could. Cut off his breathing. Looked him dead in the eye and said, \"how do you like being choked without consent? Not very fun is it?\" Got out of the car and walked off.",

Choking is something that happens internally, as when someone chokes on a piece of food. Strangling is what happens externally when another person applies force to you. We use choke frequently when we really mean strangle e.g. wrestling chokehold. \n\nHe tried to *strangle* you, not choke you. It sounds scarier because it is. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was intended to be part of a sexual activity or whether he was trying to incapacitate you, it\u2019s still strangling because you didn\u2019t consent.\n\nYou kept your head in a terrifying situation.",

    "postText": "So yesterday in the mail I got one of those handwritten letters from a  random religious person (JW in this case), going over the generic god  loves you, you should come to our church, blah blah blah, going to hell if you don't believe, yadda yadda  yadda. I find this very rude and get anxious and very annoyed whenever  this happens. The woman who sent the letter put her return address and  name on the letter, so I made a donation to the Satanic Temple in her  name, and she will be getting a thank you card in the mail from them.  Was it petty? Yes. Was it worth it? Also yes.",

They started copying the maintenance man's knock when I wouldn't open the door for them knocking like the UPS guy after their regular knock didn't get me to open the door. Same two ladies.  They're smart enough to try different knocks but not kind enough to leave me alone.  When I started getting the letters the  return address was the kingdom hall, I recognized the address, so I just chucked them. Eventually I  noticed it was a different address and I looked it up,  it was a residence.  I sent the letter back to them with a bunch of glitter. Haven't received another letter yet. It's been a few months and I had been getting 1 or 2 a month. Maybe glitter works",

They turned up at his house several times a week, same two ladies. He tried all the usual tricks, nothing was deterring them. Finally he waited until they turned up at his door one Saturday afternoon. He answered the door wearing absolutely nothing but a smile and a big red bow tied round his willy. He then asked them if they were the strippers he ordered, opened the door wide and was trying to get them to come in. They ran away, oddly enough lol. That worked for a while, but now he has two guys coming round. A new plan is currently hatching.",

She and I worked together for awhile and I genuinely enjoyed discussing religion, faith and spirituality with her, and she sought me out a few times afterwards. Lovely woman, very earnest and thoughtful. She discussed things with me that are absolutely not entry-level. She was probably already on her way out due to the whole thing with her abusive ex-husband (you know it's serious when the JWs allow a divorce, but of course they protected him and made her move to my town).\n\nLast year, she engaged in proselytizing with a man who was very curious and asked good questions that she legitimately didn't know how to answer. So she went to the elders, of course. They didn't answer any questions to her satisfaction and basically gave her the party line, which was insulting and infuriating. She thought she was on the up and up, climbing the ladder, would become well respected in the community, and they shut her down with like, level 4 answers to level 10 questions. So she goes back to the guy who'd asked these hard questions, tells him what happened and he's like, hey, so, you should watch this YouTube documentary I found. He's physically disabled and can't work, so apparently dude has a lot of time for self-directed learning. Whether he'd previously learned these things and set her up, or only looked into it after meeting her, I have no idea.\n\nEither way, it worked. I don't remember which documentary it was (it was produced by 2 ex-JWs), but she realized everything in it was horrible and true. She was wearing handcrafted gold boob earrings while telling me all this back in February (they're specifically a fuck-you, which is absolutely hilarious). I've thought of her often in the couple years since I'd seen her, and I'm genuinely happy she's working on finding herself.\n\nObviously I'm heavily paraphrasing our conversation, but yeah. Still blowing my mind that she quit JW because she was too good at door knocking.",

Except you only take communion (they don\u2019t call it that, though, I don\u2019t remember the term) if you believe you\u2019re one of the 100,000 or so getting into Heaven directly, rather than staying on Earth in eternal paradise. I can\u2019t remember exactly, but that\u2019s the idea. So no one takes communion because it looks bad. \n\nI\u2019m not JW, but my in-laws are. I\u2019ve been to a memorial because of that, and it felt like Easter service. I felt so out of place as a standard, everyday, non-denominational Christian.",

Or start writing jibberish. It will haunt them forever. (This also works in person; just start \u201cspeaking in tongues\u201d)\n\nSide note: some JWs have come under fire for these letters because they would purposely send them to people whose loved ones just passed. Like a JW will see an obituary and search for the contact of the family to send them a \u201ccomforting\u201d letter. \n\nAlso, many times the person writing these are older and/or disabled and can\u2019t physically go knock on doors so they do this instead. Sad indoctrination and manipulation tbh",

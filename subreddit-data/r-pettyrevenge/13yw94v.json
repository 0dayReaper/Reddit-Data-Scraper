    "postText": "So, like usual-forgive the formatting because I\u2019m on mobile etc\u2026\n\nBuckle up, this one is a bit long. TLDR at the end.\n\nSo this one goes back years when I worked in the restaurant industry and my wife was in recruiting. \n\nSo there I was, in a new city and like everyone who moves to a new city; in a new job. I was fortunate enough to land a job at a very swanky hotel restaurant where all the servers are either aspiring actors or influencers (we\u2019ll leave it at that because any info will give it away if you\u2019re in Canada.) I was in a garde manger position in the kitchen and responsible for presentation of dishes and during busy rushes, I acted as an expediter between the kitchen and the food runners/servers.\n\nThis is where the incident happened. \nBeing new (but fairly experienced) I was asking the chef to replate something because it was up a few minutes before another dish. Which is fairly common practice. The server comes up to the pass and just starts talking to the chef saying \u201cwhere\u2019s table 19\u2019s tenderloin?!!\u201d\nChef obviously ignored her (looking at me), that\u2019s where I politely interrupt her and say \u201cSorry about that, I asked him to hold it back because the polenta for the other meal.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s where I was stopped. She looked at me sideways (while still making eye contact with the chef) says\u2026\n\n\u201cWhy are you talking to me?\u201d\n\nI immediately apologized and excused my self, to obviously continue with the busy dinner rush. Being new, I didn\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers. Turns out she was a pain was getting let go fairly soon.\n\nMONTHS PASS! (She was let go)\n\nSitting on the couch with my wife helping her read resumes for this REALLY well paying job with a great future\u2026 you guessed it guys. I had her resume in my hand. My wife knew of the incident from the day it happened. We both checked out the resume. She had the qualifications\u2026 but what resume? I didn\u2019t see any resume. ;)\n\nI should mention, this wasn\u2019t the only negative interaction with this person. There were quite a few between our first meeting and the sweet sweet petty revenge.\n\n\nTLDR: this server I worked with hated gingers, I took her out of consideration for a job because she was a bitch.",

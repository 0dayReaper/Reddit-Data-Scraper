    "postText": "Okay so first of all let me preface that my mother and I do not have a great relationship and it got very toxic before I went NC. This is a kinda small thing but it brought me a lot of joy at the time. So a number of years ago my mother had a friend of hers that was going to be staying with her and had me pick her up from the airport and drop her off at my mom's house. I was not living with her at the time. Well the drive from the airport to my mom's house was around an hour long and I made this 50ish year old woman listen to one of my favorite bands at the time (The Front Bottoms) the entire way. I specifically remember her being very weirded out and/or concerned during \"Father\". Suffice to say my mother never guilted me into picking her friends up from the airport for her again.\n\nI also want to say this wasn't the first time I had met this woman, but it was the first time we had spent this much one on one time together. I also wasn't mean or rude in any way. I just wanted to come off as a bit weird/depressed because I knew how pissed it'd make my mom for me to not portray the role of the \"perfect son\" in front of her friends.\n\ntldr: My mom guilted me into a very inconvenient task so I weirded out her friend with depressing music the whole time.",

    "postText": "My ex broke up with me just about a year into us dating. In hindsight, she was awful but I was blind to it all. She broke up with me over the phone, which seemed a little informal from all the time we spent together. Fast forward a week after that, several individuals connected to her, but not each other, confirmed she was in fact seeing another man. I didn't confront her about it, because I realize that things just don't work out sometimes. It was just the way she went about it that irked me. I'm old enough (late 30s) to accept that people are just assholes, but I also felt like she was getting away with something without feeling even a bit of remorse (the breakup was the only contact, no calls or texts occurred after that over a year ago)\n\nI remembered for Christmas that I bought her (us) a really expensive couples massage spa package because she would always say how she wanted to do something like that. I had purchased some big package from a local place that cost roughly $600. I obviously didn't have the certificate with me. I decided to go to the spa and make up a story of how I lost the certificate. I showed them the receipt (always keep those!) and showed him my credit card charge. They wound up reissuing me a gift card, and canceling the other. \n\nThat was over a year ago and frankly I forgot about it. Today I get a call from her (first contact in a year since breaking up) and she's screaming at me over the phone that the gift certificate is no good and the spa place accused her of \"stealing\" and what a POS I was for reporting it to be such. (I called the guy, he said he told her it was reported stolen) I just politely explained I didn't think she was deserving of it and if she really wanted to, she could just have Mark (dude she was bangin') pay for new one. I then hung up. Gonna make an appointment to use that card with my new GF soon. \n\nMission accomplished.",

Just kept using it with out a peep. I knew they were using it because when I asked customer service at membership store, they could see all the transactions they'd made.\n\nSo I canceled it &amp; had them dropped, with a new card issued for me only.\n\n30 minutes later my phone starts blowing up. Turns out the ex was at the membership store WHILE I WAS CANCELING THE CARD.\n\nI just laughed &amp; laughed. Told them to get their own.\n\nStill gives me anxiety when I think about it. Black eyes &amp; a broken nose will never be forgotten.",

            "comment": "I did this with an ex and his birthday gift.\n\nHe was hinting *hard* that he wanted to see a certain band. The tickets were very expensive. I told him that maybe he would get tickets for his birthday, which he did. In his birthday card, I placed 2 neatly folded ticket printouts, one for each of us.\n\nHe suddenly and conveniently broke up with me a couple of days later, with the concert happening only a few days after that. I knew that he was planning to go with whoever he broke up with me for, and I also knew that he was too stupid to know that I could have the tickets reprinted, which would **void** his copies. (Can you still do that? This was the early days of self-printed tickets.)\n\nSo I did exactly that. I printed off new tickets, invited my brother, and we had a great time. When we left the venue, I turned on my phone and noticed I had 7 missed calls, over a dozen texts, and a very long and scream-cry-filled voicemail. He had showed up to the venue all ready to impress his new girl with an expensive concert. *OOPS!*\n\nMy brother and I sat in the car and laughed at his messages while we waited for traffic to thin out. I never responded and, after a few more hate-filled texts, never heard from him again. \n\nFuck you Howard.\n\nEdit: For those asking, it was the Rolling Stones and it happened in the mid-2000s. I'm pretty sure his broke ass never got to see them live, and I hope he thinks of me being partially responsible for that every time he hears Start Me Up on the radio.",

I hope most online ticket companies are smart enough to have a feature like this.\n\nWhen I had to sell a ticket, I was really happy to use this feature so my buyer could know I wasn't scamming them.",

He asked me what I wanted his gift to be, and I said I don\u2019t want anything. He said, \u201cim your bf I have to get you something.\u201d And I said well, I don\u2019t really want anything. And he suggested he get the tickets. I said that would be nice but I wanted it to be a gift to him and my friends. Nonetheless, he ended up getting the tickets. \n\nFast forward to the weekend before the concert, my bf kept getting mad at me for random things. Even accused me of cheating because he felt like I was talking to him less (it was bc I was working). He threatened a few times that he wouldn\u2019t come see me, and said one time that he just wasn\u2019t going to go to the concert, and another time that I could just go without him and bring someone else. I also was *really* sick, and we were talking for hours. My throat hurt so bad, and for work I have to talk on the phone. So I\u2019m quite annoyed, but I\u2019m very polite and just over it. I\u2019m not being snappy or anything, I\u2019m just like, okay if you don\u2019t want to come that\u2019s your choice, if that\u2019s how you want to handle this all, that\u2019s up to you. I can\u2019t force you to do anything. \n\nHe got mad because he felt I didn\u2019t care, but I explained I\u2019m really sick, I have work, and ultimately birthdays aren\u2019t very important to me. The only thing I cared about was seeing him and spending time with my friends. And I didn\u2019t say but, If he wanted to to cancel that and ruin my bday, there is nothing I can do about it. \n\nHe hung up on me and then called me back when he realized I wasn\u2019t going to call him back. Lol\u2026 and he started yelling at me again. Meanwhile I can barely speak. He eventually was like ok you\u2019re really sick well just talk later. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nNext day he texts me periodically asking how I am, whatever. I\u2019m not replying because he wanted to pay for the tickets, and now he was going to ruin my chance to see a band I really like all because he thinks I don\u2019t send him enough nudes or whatever while he is away. (Which irrelevant but I always did a bunch of things he never did for me, so why would I put effort in for someone who doesn\u2019t for me..) \n\nEventually he called more and I didn\u2019t answer. Eventually though I did answer and I was like, well it seems like ur mind is made up anyway. And if you don\u2019t want to come see me, I can\u2019t force u to come. Again, he claims I don\u2019t care, when really I\u2019m just exhausted by his antics.. a week or two before this I even thought we were broken up. Because he just kept going on drunken rants and then acting like nothing happened the next day. \n\nEventually though, like the next day, he says he is coming, but overall, I think the only reason he came is because he told his family he was and also, because it was about to snow so he had to move his car and he needed somewhere to stay (inevitably with me, which he was mad at me preemptively as well, because he thought he couldn\u2019t stay with me, even though I never said that..) so he was going to come regardless because he had to or he wouldn\u2019t have a car in town. He just always caused unnecessary fights for attention; likely because he did something wrong (lied or cheated or both). \n\nI had a good birthday though. In spite of him ditching me outside of bars in 4 inch heels, &amp; being a party pooper at the concert. &amp; then he died a few days later.",

I went through a similar level of profound disrespect from my parents and cut contact 18 months ago, and it's been a surprisingly good 18 months.  I don't remember the source, but this philosophy has greatly increased my overall quality of life:  \"I would rather adjust my life to your absence than adjust my boundaries to accommodate your disrespect.\"\n\nNot that I would care, but *did* you kill the guy?",

He got mad at me all the time about how he thinks I was distant, but he would just lie and just not tell me shit. His dad was going to jail, and I never even knew what for.

It\u2019s bc he lies..And then sober, doesn\u2019t talk about it, just wants to \u201cenjoy his movie,\u201d because he \u201cworks so hard\u201d.  \n\nBut hell maybe I did kill him ina way.

He\u2019s going to support his friend whose sister just died of an OD..He said he didn\u2019t want to go, but he said he promised so he \u2018wanted to keep his word\u2019 be a man of his word..(I think he was just saying this tbh bc he was a liar), I almost go with him, but he goes on about how his friends are opening their homes up to him, and it\u2019s more inconvenient for them if I go, and how he\u2019ll get distracted and won\u2019t spend as much time with them (more bs). I say whatever if you don\u2019t want me to go, that\u2019s fine Ill stay. \n\nSo he drives off, we speak on the phone briefly while he is close to arriving. We FaceTime later for a short bit and it\u2019s just him being a little odd, having dinner, but he\u2019s a bit off.. he seemed like he just wanted me off the phone, didn\u2019t really want to talk. Usually he is the one keeping me on the phone, so it was weird. \n\nNext day, we FaceTime at about 4pm his time, and I\u2019ve seen him be drunk on FT, this was another level. He was drinking, but he wasn\u2019t acting drunk at all. He was nervous, wide eyed, looking around everywhere. He usually talks quite a bit, but this time his answers are like three words tops, and he just glances everywhere. Made some weird faces, eyes rolled back at one point. I ask him a few times what\u2019s up, what did he take, is he ok.. and he just denies, denies.. we\u2019re just drinking. I say I don\u2019t believe him. He says they drank and had Xanax yesterday, but that he has just been drinking now. I don\u2019t believe him, but I can\u2019t really do anything about it. Later that night is when he died/by the morning they took him to the hospital he was pronounced dead.",

I found out he was cheating, and had been for a long time, very soon after. It made me sick and super pissed thinking he may get take the other woman to get a massage using MY money, and his cheating ass didn\u2019t deserve a massage, either.\n\nI called the spa and explained what happened, and asked if they could do anything. They asked for the name of the cheater and his cheating accomplice, and told me they banned them from the spa. Something about bad vibes. They asked if I wanted a refund or to use the money for treatments for myself. I used up the money on myself, and the spa even gave me discounted massages so the $400.00 actually was worth far more. \n\nIt took me over a year to use up that gift certificate money.",

They were set to visit about a year out and I wanted to surprise her. So for Christmas, I got her tickets, the new album, shirt, the whole list. Not even a week later, she gets caught, again, talking to her bf.(that's another story) So, me finally getting a spine, I secretly cancel the tickets, and when I get my refund, bought myself a PS5 with all the extras. She asked about it for months and I would say something vague. The night before, she asked me about it and starts looking for a sitter. I casually mention for what? She says it's for the concert. I tell her I'll be home tomorrow so why bother. She looks at me and ask if we are going to the concert. I laugh and mention I canceled the tickets months ago. She was pissed but her tune changed when I asked her to ask her bf for tickets. Anyways, it's been over a year and the kids are staying with me and she can move out.",

He had gone a handful of times as a kid, but I'd been a passholder my whole life (I had a family member who got us insane discounts).\n\nNow Disneyland passes allow you to put down a 'downpayment' and then make monthly payments to keep it up. If you miss a payment, they void the pass, you can't resume payments, you just lose out. (Not sure if this is still the policy, but it was then.) I explained all this to him, and told him I put the payments on Autopay for both our passes.\n\nWe broke up in April and so I stopped making payments on his pass. If he'd asked, I would have transferred ownership to him, but he never asked.\n\nThen in June he called me PISSED. He had planned a whole day at Disneyland with his new girlfriend, and had just been told his pass had been voided a few months ago. He told me I needed to resume payments, and when I explained that wouldn't work he told that I needed to buy him a new pass.\n\nYeah, hard pass. Or no pass I guess.",

She told me that after the fact hoping I'd be stuck standing at the gate.  I laughed and told her the plan didn't work out the way wmshe thought.\n\nFuck her, I didn't even like Joe Nichols that much anyway",

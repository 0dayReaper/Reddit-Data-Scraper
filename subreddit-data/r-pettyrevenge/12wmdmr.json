    "postText": "I went to college in this big multi-campus system all over my country that holds an annual songwriting and performing contest. As a guitar player, I won several prizes and enjoyed four years of stardom in our college music circuit. I graduated and life went on until some 7 years later when the college contacted us (me and my old band) to ask us for a special concert to commemorate some big anniversary of the contest. We happily obliged and spent like a month rehearsing and having fun. After that, we decided that it had been so much fun that we would rehearse every Saturday new songs and eventually, we\u2019d put up a show, so we started doing it in our Keyboard Player (KP) house because he had this huge rehearsal room.\n\nBut\u2026 After graduating, KP became a born-again christian, had this huge worship band and everything in his life was \u201cworship oriented\u201d. One day, his christian bandmates came to our rehearsal and they took over the instruments while we were taking a rest and started playing some worship tunes. They projected the lyrics with the chords on a screen, and since their guitar player wasn\u2019t there, I started following them and playing along. Their leader, a hell of a singer and pianist had written the song and when it ended, he told me I had made the song feel better than ever and that I had been \u201ca blessing to play with\u201d. I\u2019m an outspoken antitheist, but I\u2019ve learned to live and let live, so I kept my big mouth shut, told him the pleasure was mutual, and kept on enjoying every rehearsal, playing with my friends, and having lots of fun.\n\nIn fact, I was having too much fun, because one day I came for rehearsal and found out I had been told the wrong schedule to arrive an hour earlier because KP wanted to speak with me. He told me that \u201cwhen you\u2019re playing in the congregation, you\u2019re just the channel through which god manifests himself, so the applause and all the recognition are for him, not for you as a musician\u201d and I was being disrespectful to that because I was dancing, headbanging, jumping around and making \u201crockstar poses while playing overly complicated solos\u201d so I was an attention whore wanting the spotlight on me and not recognizing that it was god manifesting through my playing.\n\nI was dumbfounded and choosing my words very carefully (aiming to kill, tbh) when he decided to go on with the next point in his agenda: \u201cI\u2019m telling you all of this because, in two months, there will be this huge event in which there will be christian bands from all over America (the whole continent) and\u2026 we\u2019d love for you to come to play with us because our guitar player while decent enough, can\u2019t make the guitar sing as beautifully as you do\u201d (His words, not mine).\n\nI looked at him straight in the eye and said \u201cMy man, you have the guitar player your god has chosen to manifest itself with through your band. Don\u2019t shun him because then you\u2019d be disrespecting your god\u2019s will. You certainly don\u2019t want an egocentric shredder playing along with you, selfless folks\u201d.\n\nGot up, packed my gear, and have never seen him again.",

Because the good you do in that mindset IS your good.  It is you redeeming your tainted soul and proving you are worthy of His love.\n\nBut the denominations that split the hair.  Good = God, Evil = Your Own Fault remove ANY rational accountability.\n\nTake religion out of the equation entirely and think about it.\n\nLet's replace religion with money!  You go to work for 8 hours.  You earn $160.  But you were only channeling the work of someone else, so THEY get the $160, and you have to trust that they'll use it to buy you things you want.  But if you don't go to work, you owe them $160 because you didn't do what you were supposed to.\n\nHow does that approach EVER incentivize you to work?  Might as well just never work, and owe them more every day.  Or, even better, go work somewhere else that pays YOU not your magical bank account manager.\n\nIe, you're going to naturally end up in another denomination that acknowledges the good deeds that you do, and thanks YOU for doing them.  Or non-religious could be the outcome as well.",

Meanwhile while I do believe you were gifted by God to play you never held yourself out as a believer. In fact HE was the one guilty of performance motive since he was picking you over the other guitar player. Now, having said that, other guitar player should certainly practice and develop his skill for the audience of One. \n\nThere's a lot wrong with the worship world but none of it was or is your fault, my dude.",

Not all churches feel that all band members need to be Christians. Others feel that all band members are, in essence, deacons and need to meet those qualifications. Most churches fall somewhere in between. \n\nBut where KP went awry was expecting a non-Christian band member to \"play for an audience of One\" or, in other words, to be worshiping.  If you have non Christians in your band, they are simply musicians in your band. You can not ask them to pretend to worship. \n\nIf KP had said, \"we would appreciate it if you moved around less because most people are coming to worship and will likely find it distracting. Do you mind?\" That would have been a polite and reasonable ask.  And it would have been just as polite and reasonable to get a \"No\" as an answer.",

Like, no lol. That\u2019s not how that works. And there\u2019s literally Bible verses that tell us NOT to do that. \u201cTake the plank out of your own eye before attempting to remove the speck from your neighbors\u201d comes to mind.

He stated their position kindly and honestly (and, it sounds like, privately), while giving you the choice about how to proceed. If instead, he had essentially just \u201cfired\u201d you, you would have likely had some rant about that instead. \n\nOverall, it sounded like it was a necessary conversation, and went about as well as it could have, considering the radically different beliefs and perspectives of you and the band.",

    "postText": "So I (24f) work overnights at a hotel. Mostly my job consists of sitting at the desk and scrolling reddit until I start paperwork and breakfast. Important to note, my shift ends at 7am. As I type this its 7:20am. \n\nWe have this one girl who works mornings, and I can't stand her. Without fail everytime she is my relief, I am at work typically 40 minutes to an hour past 7am. She's lazy and just doesn't care about anyone else's time or the fact that I've been at work since 11pm. Her typical excuse is that she can't drop her kid off at school until 7:30, which is totally understandable. Except for the fact that its summer, and her kid goes to a program that has drop off starting at 6:45am. So where is she for that extra hour? No clue, but she always shows up with coffee and breakfast. \n\nNow normally when I make breakfast, I'm very organized and clean. I wash dishes as I go, wipe up any mess I make, prep trays of extra breakfast to throw in the oven as needed. I try to make life as easy as possible for the next shift. But this girl? Oh no, sweetie, you can guarantee that that kitchen looks like a tornado blew through it. I'm using a new spoon everytime, leaving messes where they fall, and you can bet your ass I'm not soaking those nasty egg pans. \n\nYou want to make me late going home? Enjoy spending most of your shift scraping dried gravy and pancake batter off every surface in that kitchen. And don't forget to make a new batch of everything because ain't no way in hell I'm even trying up biscuits for you.\n\nTL;DR Coworker shows up 40 minutes late, gets to spend most of her shift cleaning up the breakfast mess.\n\nAnd btw, its now 7:30am, no sign of her.",

Worked 24s in an ambulance, brief stint as 3rd shift as a gas station clerk (too many guns in my face) and night auditor... Full moons the crazies come out and hospitals are more busy. Tell a nightshift nurse you don't believe full moon causes injuries, and tell a night auditor it's not true  more crazy people or doing crazier things or both happens in full moon.. I agreed to work the non drinking holidays for that reason (and Halloween). It's crazy people get that wasted traveling and in a plane and in places in the world",

I read somewhere that they tend to remember a little more on full moons, but never read another article or paper showing the same correlation. Yeah I wouldn't want to be working at a long-term care facility with that subset of pathos.\n\nMan gives me an idea for my doctorial thesis. Does brain activity change on a full moon. Would be interesting to do brain scans on that to compare. In theory we might learn of a different type of sensory input.\n\nFeels like we are reaching a new generation of diagnosing causes. For example, we think IBS has to do with gravity.\nSome Cognitive Decline Disorders look like they are related to nose picking (that's how people get brain eating amoebas, so it seems feasible bacteria or viruses (they're leaning viral) under our nails could be causing a bad autoimmune response  in the brain.

We had numerous people who were consistently late and they never got fired. \n\nWe had a housekeeper who was rumored to use the hotel as venue for her sex work but she showed up consistently to work (as a housekeeper, not for the sex stuff) and was there long after I quit. \n\nMy hotel was a low budget long-stay type place so YMMV.",

I think we only had to do that once before they got the hint to get their asses on the floor. It was glorious walking out that day seeing how backed up they were because they didn't have coffee.

In every case, no consequences for the habitually tardy relief coworker. \n\nPunctuality has not generally been my strong suit (ADHD doesn\u2019t play well with executive functioning skills!). The jobs I\u2019ve had where being on-time was a necessity, I was reliable. In the jobs I\u2019ve had where it made no difference whatsoever what time I arrived, aside from that being the time I was instructed to be there (typical 9-5 type), I was occasionally late. Usually not more than a couple of minutes. (Sometimes longer, but only in one job I can think of.) None of which required I unlock the building, handle morning stuff for the building, answer the main phones, relieve anyone, or where someone else\u2019s ability to do their job relied on my tasks being done first. And I more than made up for the few minutes here or there when I wasn\u2019t quite on-time. I am a really efficient and hard worker (frequently praised for the quality of my work, so I wasn\u2019t sloppily racing through it!). I would often help others who were under a pile, when I inevitably completed my work with time to spare. \n\nIn EVERY case, my tardiness was an issue at these jobs. I was either let go, or penalized for it at my reviews. Never mind my working through breaks and lunch when the workload was heavy, often staying late off the clock, because I thought it mattered. Nope. The (literal) 17 seconds I clocked in late one day was actually highlighted in my review at one place, and used against me. \n\nBut y\u2019all have all these stories of notoriously late coworkers whose start time isn\u2019t arbitrary, who others count on to be there on-time,  who are even excessively late (like 45-60 minutes!), but who never get punished or fired for it. \n\nAbsolutely blows my mind!",

I started with reporting it (they have kids so the have to be late), made sure any and all tasks done during those times were hard documented showing I did them (they resorted to using white out to cover their tracks, fyi you can scratch it off to see the original), and more.  The only way it stopped was getting a new job at a different property.   \n\nFind things that will make their life uncomfortable, not just the messy kitchen.  Someone comes to check out?  Leave the final step for the late person.  Things need restocked over night?  Put just enough to make them have to do more.  Find all the small things...paper in printer?  Leave less than 10 sheets in any printing device.  Always fun during a rush.  Have someone call and schedule personal wake up calls for vacant rooms.  Maybe things are unplugged that take time to boot.  \n\nJust be careful because a lot of this can come back on you.",

After a certain point you become more expensive to employ than your coworker if you\u2019re getting time and a half with overtime. \n\nIs your boss the person who does payroll? If *they\u2019re* not doing payroll, someone will 100% notice that-\n\n1: they have two employees scheduled to work back to back with the same hours\n\n2: one employee is getting payed way more than they\u2019re supposed to be if they have the same hours\n\n3: it is not cost effective to pay one employee overtime when there is another employee to pick up the workload\n\nSomeone\u2019s ass is going to be had, maybe even two",

Call them everytime at 7am saying you have to go and your relief hasn\u2019t shown, tell them to contact your relief.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve worked in hotels for years and the whole 7-3, 3-11, 11-7 shift just begs for people to stay over. I worked a hotel that did 6:30-3, 2:30-11, 10:30-7 and that schedule makes the most sense. It allows for breaks while still receiving your full 8 hours and if someone was running late it did not eat into the time you were supposed to leave. Also allowed for pass on and bank counting without staying past. \n\nCurrently trying to convince my current hotel to adopt this schedule because I too have a chronically late coworker and I\u2019m over staying until 3:30 every day",

    "postText": "Many years ago I used to work nights and shared a cubicle workspace with someone who worked days. We'll call her Karen... Karen apparently thought the entire cubicle belonged to her and nobody was allowed to sit there, everything was labeled with her name and she would lock the desk. I had to get a separate file cabinet just so I could store my files and stuff as she was not willing to share. She had little nick nacks (figures) all over the desk in inconvenient areas that made it difficult to work so I would simply move them to the monitor stand out of the way. I'm short and she's tall, I'd adjust the seat, monitor and phone to be comfortable (hated feeling like a little kid with my feet dangling). \n\nFast forward a few weeks of doing the routine of moving the figures and adjusting the workspace for my use. I come in and there's an 11x14 piece of paper taped to the monitor with an aggressive note \"Night person- DO NOT MOVE MY STUFF, IT'S NOT YOURS TO TOUCH and STOP adjusting the seat and monitor because it's NOT ERGONOMICALLY CORRECT blah blah blah...\"  I showed my manager the letter and how the desk was when I came in then again after adjusting it to my needs. He laughed and said she's crazy, continue to adjust it to better suit your needs and she can do the same when she comes in. \n\nQue the petty revenge. I started moving everything into random configurations daily for a couple weeks (monitor in front of desk and everything behind it stacked up like a pyramid, unplugged phone from base and put the mouse in its place, left seat upsidedown etc...) I recruited coworkers to get in on the fun helping to redesign each new layout. It reminded me of what Jim used to do to Dwight in \"The Office\" we didn't go as far as putting \"her\" stapler in jello lol. \n\nMy friend worked days two cubicles over (conveniently next to the managers office) and said Karen would stomp past her every day to complain to the manager about the night person who was destroying her stuff and making it difficult to work, she conveniently left out the fact she had left a note starting this whole petty revenge. After about a week of her complaining the manager asked if anything was missing or broken and she said \"well no, but\". Tired of her b.s. they cut her off and said to simply readjust to her needs and only come to them if anything was vandalized. It was fun to hear from my friend how hot and bothered she was not knowing what she would find each morning.  \n\nI never saw another note from her but about a year later she was voluntold to move to nights. She was telling a few of us about the situation of course playing the victim and asked if we had any idea who it could have been. The cubicle was empty because I had promoted and no longer sat at \"her\" desk by this time. Guess she expected the person (me) to get thrown under the bus because the day crew was cutthroat, little did she know the night crew was ride or die lol. We all played dumb and started laughing the second she walked outside.\n\nNo the cubicle does not belong to you, others are allowed to use it and adjust items accordingly, you entitled Karen.",

One coworker, who has since retired, told me one day that I needed to make sure I put the seat back to how he uses it at the end of my shift. There was a person who drove the car for their eight hour intervals in between mine and his shift. No one in this job gets in the car and is comfortable right away. I am shorter than most of my coworkers, so they have to readjust the chair just to sit down properly. I point-blank told him I would try and then never did a damn thing. Because it\u2019s not my job to make sure the seat is comfortable for you and I can\u2019t memorize how it was when I got in the freaking car.\n\nI'm pretty sure he didn\u2019t like me because I was young and female. Which I've dealt with so many people that seem to think that those two things make me an idiot.",

Yes, my vehicle, so I get the #1 setting even though he drives it way more than I do. When he gets in after me, he'll kill his knees, so he just hits the other button and the seat moves to his settings. Wish all cars had this option.",

One of the techs assumed that being employed there for 15 years meant the left side/computer of the workspace was only meant for her. After being there for about 2 weeks, I noticed she would move the only stapler or hole punch to her side in the exact same spot and would get onto anyone that touched it or used it. She would complain to the doctor about this every time it happened and he\u2019d tell her that the items aren\u2019t being damaged and are not her personal property so he didn\u2019t need to write anyone up and basically told her to get over it. That infuriated her. She started leaving sticky notes on everything. Ex: the hole punch had a note that said \u201cLeave at 1.5cm measurement after every use!!!\u201d. After I saw that sticky note I made sure to slightly adjust the measurement every time I passed it, probably 20-30x a day, and she FREAKED out each time. I did this everyday for the entire year I worked there.",

Our desks were not to be touched by others as we ticked the box for employee diversity and our stuff had to be like it was for our various handicaps. The centre operated 24/7 and unfortunately we often came in to find someone had just decided they wanted our desks for whatever reason they had, usually because it was closer to the breakout area for the coffee machines and food vending machine. The night team leaders didn\u2019t usually bother the miscreants because they were usually excellent at selling the banks credit cards and loans. I was glad when I was able to leave due to my disability becoming incompatible with work. A few years later the banks all had to start compensating everything that had been misold during the period I worked there. Considering what wankers they and their high performing sales agents were I was very happy.

If she had never left that ugly note, things would have been so much easier for her. Moving the figures and adjusting the seat/monitor and phone took less than 2 mins of her time. I know I did it daily, and it didn't really bother me because everyone is allowed to work in a space that is comfortable to them. After the note, it was easily 20 mins wasted trying to readjust the entire cubicle but could potentially be more if she couldn't figure out what we did the night before (ghost dual monitor was the one that took her 3 days to figure out).",

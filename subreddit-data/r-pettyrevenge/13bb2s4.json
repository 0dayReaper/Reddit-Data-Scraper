    "postText": "Yesterday, i cooked burgers for my family. Currently, we are 8 in the house. My eldest brother and his wife are there because their apartment is being fixed so they need a place to stay for two months, which is our house. I did smash burgers from scratch....YES even the potato buns are from scratch and I grinded the meat myself using the kitchenaid meat grinder. I made the servings, two patties for each potato bun and each person in my family will get two burgers.....Except mom and dad since they don't wanna eat so much but the rest want. I made 14 buns which means there are 28 thin patties.\n\nHowever, during dinner time, dad had some mushroom burgers mom bought in the grocery and he said that he has gout. He did have the potato buns and he said they were delicious. When my eldest brother got........He tried to get 4 patties for a single potato bun and I slapped his hand IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE FAMILY. He got so mad, we argued....his wife just ignored it and jsut let me and her husband argue. My brother said \"Dad can't get so I'm jsut getting his share and I told my bro that he has no right to automatically claim a share of someone but he said \"Its gonna be the same thing if dad won't get\" then i coutnered \"You're not the cook so screw you\". Mom then just raised her voice and told everyone to keep quiet.\n\nIt felt so good slapping my brother's hand. He has been like that. When someone can't get.....he automatically says their share is his even when they never said he can get their share. It happened a lot and it happened now to a food I just cooked.\n\nTLDR: My bro tried to get two servings because one member can't eat the food but I slapped his hand.",

My brother and I were arguing and he lightly slapped me (he\u2019s not violent but was used to getting a little physical with me during rows). She went mental at him and he came and genuinely apologised. He\u2019d just never seen anything wrong in what he did and because our parents always sided with him she was the first person to give him the shake up he needed. 30 years later and he\u2019s never hit anyone again and she is more like a sister than ever.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame your sister in law didn\u2019t do the same and tell your brother he was being a greedy ass, but I guess it\u2019s good she didn\u2019t openly side with him.\n\n(Edited because hit submit button too soon)",

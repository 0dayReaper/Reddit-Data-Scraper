    "postText": "Where I live, the houses are very close together. Where my garage ends, their space begins and the stairs leading up to their house is about 20 feet from my garage. There have been many instances where the garbage collectors leave my neighbors trash can in front of my garage. That is not a problem. \n\nThe problem is that the neighbor can't take a few seconds to move it out from in front of my garage. I don't expect them to move it same day. However, there have been multiple instances where the garbage can is in front of my garage 2-3 days after trash pickup. Pretty sure the neighbor has left their house in that time span and seen the garbage can.\n\nThis neighbor also never brings their garbage can in like everyone else. Instead, they leave it on the street right between my garage and their stairs. Bit of an eye sore, and they will also bring out excess trash that doesn't fit the bin more than a night before pick up. This has caused trash to fly out (gets pretty windy where we are) and get all over the street.\n\nThis past trash pick up, the garbage can was once again left in front of my garage. I moved it to the front of their place. Today, I go to use my car and the damn can is again in front of my garage. Not sure if someone did it or the wind moved it over. Either way, this would not happen if they ever took their garbage can up. \n\nI was very annoyed so I loaded the trash can into my car and took it to my cousin who is helping with a tear down of a house. House isn't far, maybe a 10 minute drive. Put the garbage can in the big dumpster they are using for all the crap from the house.\n\nNow, the annoying neighbor will need to either deal with not having a garbage can and potentially/most likely get increasing fines or pay a fee to get another one from the city.\n\nNormally, I would try to talk to the person. However, this neighbor has gotten into arguments with several other neighbors among other shitty behavior. Did not want to deal with that.\n\nEDIT: Adding one funny/ironic(?) detail about all this that I forgot to include. The number painted on the bin is actually my old house number. The bin used to belong to my house before I purchased it. When I purchased my home, the city required us to renumber (whole street was doing that) as part of the transaction. We had new bins by the time I moved in so it wasn't until after I moved in that I noticed the next door neighbor had our old bin. No idea how they got it or why they took it. Probably needed a new one and didn't want to pay, but saw my house at the time was not occupied. These were the people before the current occupants. Left it alone since I had new bins anyway and didn't want to start off immediately on the wrong foot with a neighbor.",

Makes it clear they need to move them.\n\nI have a rental that has a zero property line, i.e. edge of my garage is their property. neighbor there would leave the cans right by my driveway, and city cited me for it. I called the city and explained the law to them. they sent citation to neighbor and the cans got move to their backyard. Sometimes problems get solved easily.",

The protestors stole it in the middle of the night ot use as a barricade. They stole a bunch of dumpsters that night. Other things dumb protestors have done is try to blockade the train tracks when oil was being shipped down it because it it came from fracking. The cops had to keep physically removing these dumbasses from the tracks because they were using their bodies as a blocade to stop... trains.",

            "comment": "We handle trash can problems with our neighbors similarly. We live in a city row home next to an apartment building. The building has a contract for trash pickup that is separate from the regular trash and recycling night. (The ownership is terrible. They only got the pickup because I kept getting them fined for the conditions behind the building to the extent that it was cheaper to do the right thing. And I straight up warned the owner that I would keep getting him fined until he made good on his promise to get the trash collection service.) \n\nThe building residents aren\u2019t much better. They will get regular trash cans and recycling cans (despite having the service), fill them, and never take them out to the curb on trash day. So the cans would sit back there spilling over and stinking unless we dragged them to the curb. The contract for trash collection only covers the large garbage cans provided by the waste management company. So my husband and I just started disappearing all of the neglected cans. We\u2019ll give them 2 missed trash days and then they\u2019re gone. There is a ton of foot traffic and the area behind the building is unsecured. They suspect us but they can\u2019t prove anything. \n\nA couple times we\u2019ve been asked about missing cans by a tenant. We just shrug and say that things tend to disappear from back there. But in our experience, keeping the area looking neat seems to help. Messes send the wrong message and attract unsavory characters. They finally got the message and the cans get taken to the curb on trash and recycling night now.",

Doesn\u2019t bother me at all because it doesn\u2019t block my driveway. I use to have neighbors that would cross my driveway and two others to take my can and bring it to their house to use. I even painted my house number on the can but they still took them. Took to dumping the trash in their driveway right where they park and taking my can back after all other failed attempts to get them to stop.\n\nCalled city to get a new one for neighbor (city provides cans for automated trucks) hoping that would stop them from taking mine but got told I\u2019d need to file a police report before I could get a new one and only the owner of a property could request new can. No problem. Filed report, neighbors were cited for theft, got my can back and a new one as well.",

I know who it belongs to due to the serial # on it. I just left it hoping it would eventually break and next door would be down a bin due to laziness.

I drove a GMC Jimmy at  the time, so one day right in front f him, I eased up to his Mazda and shoved it to the front of his house.  \n3) He put his trash in front of our house for pickup, instead of his own. I tolerated this until he included a used tire ... city won't pick up tires and you have to pay to dispose of them. I'd put in back in front of his house, only to find it in my yard again. I finally threw the tire onto his roof, where it stayed until we moved away about a year later.   \n\n\nWITA? Frankly, Scarlett, I DGAF. I invited him to settle it like men, more than once (and I'm pretty nonviolent), but he declined. :)",

The two adults would put the kids \"to bed\" on the big bed in their living room at like seven in the evening and then go to the bedroom where they got stoned all night.\n\nExcept the kids didn't go to bed.  They would run, push furniture around, and bounce balls until late at night, like two or three in the morning.  I worked the 7-3 shit and had to be up early so this did not work for me at all.\n\nSo I gt home one day and mixed up a big batch of chocolate chip cookie dough and waited.  When seven rolled around I preheated the oven and put a fresh dozen on a plate and walked out my door at exactly seven thirty, which was also when I heard the ball start bouncing.\n\nI walked upstairs and rang the bell.  The man who answered the door looked groggy and I handed him the plate.  \"Here, I made cookies and I thought your kids might like some for desert!\" I say in my best customer service voice.\n\n\"That's nice\" he rumbles.  \"But they're already in bed.\"\n\n\"Oh, they are?!  I had no idea!  I could hear them playing from downstairs and just assumed...  I mean, that ball bouncing and the chairs moving and the banging...  I'm sorry I bothered you.  Here, take these in apology, then.  The kids can have them for a snack tomorrow!\"  \n\nYou know, I never heard those kids again?  Not more than the lightest footsteps.",

I think it was their kid taking out the garbage each week so I tried talking to them but they were never home when I went and I never saw them. So I left a note. It was polite and simply asked them to put them 5 feet in either direction (completely do-able).\n\nAfter the note they started putting them directly behind my garage and about 2 feet further into the alley. So I just stopped picking them up or moving them. It took about a month of me knocking them over or moving them so the truck couldn't grab them for them to start putting them in another place. \n\nMoral of the story is sometimes it pays to be petty",

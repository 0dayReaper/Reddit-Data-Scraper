    "postText": "So my wife of 5 years is a wonderful and lovely lady. She is so smart, beautiful, patient and stubborn.\n\nEvery time she goes out grocery shopping she comes home as the amazing wife she is and puts the groceries away. HOWEVER. You know that spot on the fridge door on the top shelf that's just big enough to put a carton of eggs? Well lo and behold that where we put our eggs and the top of the carton sits a bit more than flush with the rail. Well when my wife puts things away she will often put other things on top of the carton, at which point the item is no longer protected by the rail.\n\nQueue the pettiest of revenges. After opening the fridge door all week and having a whole container of blueberries spill out onto the floor, picking them up, washing them off and putting them back in the empty crisper. Everyday the package found its way back onto the eggs. So one night after the whole family fell asleep. I went to the fridge and wrote a letter to my wife... from \"the eggs\". With that note I stuck 5 toothpicks into the carton nailing the letter to the carton. Then I impaled a blueberry onto each toothpick.\n\nThe letter read something to the effect of...\n\n\"Dear MRS of the house, procuror of food and stocker of the sacred temple of freshness. I the leader of the ovum empire have reason to believe that you wish to antagonize us with your constant acts of war. We are delicate beings and will no longer tolerate any other civilizations to be built upon our shoulders. You will find attached to this letter 5 tokens of warning. We will not ask twice. Next time there will be war.\n\nSigned the choosen one\n\nTo this day, she hasn't placed anything else on the eggs. However she routinely jokes about it.",

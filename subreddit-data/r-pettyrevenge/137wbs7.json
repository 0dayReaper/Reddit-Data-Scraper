    "postText": "After my second marriage fell apart, I moved in with my mom for a year. Summer came, and an ice cream truck started coming through the neighborhood twice a day. The driver decided that the best place to stop was right in front of my mom's house.\n\nThe song his truck played was Music Box Dancer, and he kept it playing for the whole time he was there, which ranged from twenty to thirty minutes. It was maddening. I asked him if he could shut it off after ten minutes, since by then all the kids knew he was there. He told me to go fuck myself.\n\nI worked second shift, so I was home during the day. My boss had a buddy who drove a delivery truck for a company that sold exactly the kind of stuff you would buy from an ice cream truck. He was more than happy to sell me whatever I wanted at wholesale cost, and gave me some of it for free. My mom had a chest freezer conveniently located in the mudroom on the side of the house. \n\nI talked to some of the neighbors about what the guy had said, and how I planned to get my petty revenge. When they heard that he had dropped the F-bomb in front of little kids, they were all on my side. They already didn't like him because he was gruff, unfriendly just generally ill-suited for a job that involved talking to people, especially children. Word got around, and whenever the truck showed up, the kids would all go right past him and line up at the side door of my mom's house. \n\nMy mother was 100% on board. She was next-level petty, and was delighted to help out. I'd take orders, and she would pull the stuff from the freezer. \n\nOne of the neighbors jad warned me that she had been threatened with fines for selling homemade ice pops without the appropriate permit the previous summer, so I just gave that shit away for free. Some of the parents would give their kids money to tip me, though. I still lost money, but no more than three or four bucks a day.\n\nThe second day I was doing it, the driver confronted me and asked me what the fuck I thought I was doing. I said, \"I tried talking to you like a grown-up, and you acted like a child. This is what you get. Now get off my property.\"\n\nHe made some threats of physical violence, and my mom called the cops. He was gone by the time they showed up, but they took statements from me, my mom, the dad from next door and a couple of the kids who were waiting for their ice cream when he made the threat. \n\nHe didn't own the truck, and bunch of parents called the outfit he worked for to complain about him swearing and threatening violence in front of their kids. We didn't see the truck for about a week and a half, and when it started coming around again, there was a different person running it. The jerkwad was charged with making terrorist threats. The dad from next door and I got subpoenas and testified against him. He was able to plead it down to harassment, but he had priors, so he still got a fine and six months probation. \n\nThe new driver was an older guy. He loved kids, and the kids loved him. I shut down my operation, and gave the rest of my stock away when the neighborhood had a block party the weekend before school started.",

Having said that, yes the repetitious music boxes they used were extremely annoying when you were driving so I preferred to turn it off when I stopped just for the respite. Also if there were groups of people ahead waiting I would generally stop somewhere between them to 'encourage' them to meet at a spot equidistant from them so that I didn't have to make multiple stops within feet of each other since I did turn off both the engine and the music.

The noise, the engine heat, the carbon monoxide was just way too much. I finally called parking enforcement, who got him to move on charge of traffic lane obstruction.

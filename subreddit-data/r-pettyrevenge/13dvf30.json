    "postText": "Mandatory - english not my first language, lack of vocalubary might be felt.\n\nContext that I think matters\n\nThis happened today, when I went to grab lunch to the convenience store. Its one of those stores where they have conditery products made there in the store, so they always are fresh - crossaints, donuts, other donuts, buns and so on.\n\nAlso this store has a loyalty app or smth, so for example if u buy some product that day, you get a coupon to purchase a donut for example, with a coupon it costs one cent. \n\nOn to the story, my shopping most of the time is in an out, i grab what I need  and head to self checkout. This time I grabbed some instant 3in1 coffee box package. The store does not sell boxes whole, you have to open it and scan one and write the number in package. But in self checkout it gives error. I am forced to go to the regular checkout and its where the action starts.\n\nI don't know if it was a universe, but as I am approaching the only working checkout(from self-checkout) I come to the end of the line, there is like two meters between me and next person, but there is also this lady with a classic Karen haircut, walking between this checkout as if checking if the next checkout is working, but staying in this line?\n\nAs I am closing the distance and I am about to put my groceries on that movong thingy, she gets in between me and person in front of me, and starts frantically putting her groceries. As I am in a Huge shock by the audacity, I say nothing, just look at her.\n\nAs she has finished unloading her groceries she starts looking around and leaves the queue to go grab extra stuff. Leaving her stuff behind. The line is not moving fast, so her groceries are not moving. In a while she comes back and stays on the line scrolling the whole time. But one of her products - her donut, the one on the app for one cent is on the ledge of that moving part and on the end of it, and is not moving on the conveyor belt(remembered how its called, not gonna edit previous calls) together with her other groceries. \n\nAs soon as there is enough space to place my groceries, I do so, and make sure her donut stays off the the conveyor belt on that ledge at the end of it. I keep my eye on her, as she proceeds in the queue with phone in hand, cashier checks her out, she still on her phone, uses her QR code from the app, puts her groceries in the damn bag, pays and leaves. Her donut still on the ledge. \n\nMy turn to pay, I say goodbye to her with my eyes and a smile on my face. I proceed to pay for my groceries, inform the cashier that some other customer probably left the donut there and leave the store.\n\nI will sleep well tonight knowing that Karen is gonna think about grabbing that pink donut, putting it in a bag, then on the conveyor belt and when she gets home realise there is no donut in her bag.",

I just suspended transaction, moved their shit to the side and helped the next person, making them wait in line to get their shit checked out. I don't mind it when I don't have a line of people waiting, but don't be rude and make people wait while you go run off to get something else.",

People like that lady can never admit blame for a simple mistake and rather accuse other people\u2026 she probably did get home &amp; assumed the employee swiped it instead of chalking it up to it being an error on her part. Not OP\u2019s fault, though \u2014 it would have happened regardless.",

There are security cameras in the store, there is also security guard on duty too. Which would lead to the accuser being escorted out of the store. We don't deal with shitty customers here.   \nAlso its pretty common to leave products that you cannot afford or think you dont wanna buy it anymore, to the cashier. \n\nThere is also a receipt being printed out, on paper and sent to the app if app was used, and there would be no donut in the receipt, so.",

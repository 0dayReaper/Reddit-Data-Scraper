    "postText": "I had been in reporting for nearly a decade when my director asked me to fudge some incident numbers by 10% in his benefit. I told him I can\u2019t do that as it is a SOX violation. He told me it wasn\u2019t.  So I explained to him that fudging the numbers by 10% would impact contract penalties in our benefit. Je then told me to fudge the numbers or I was fired. \n\nSo I fudged the numbers and put a disclaimer under the horizontal axis that stated \u201cAll numbers have been adjusted by 10% as directed by director\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t bother to read the chart\u2019s disclaimer and presented it to executive leadership. They saw the disclaimer and asked about it. My director told them that I was mad and this was to get back at him. I was called in to explain the disclaimer. I brought my laptop with me as I figured what was going on. \n\nUpon entering the conference room I see those present and realize either me or my director was getting fired.  They asked me some questions and I explained why I put the disclaimer on the chart as it was a SOX violation and I wasn\u2019t going to prison to protect my job. They wanted proof that the numbers were adjusted, so I opened up the modified report and the original report. I highlighted the modifications. They were appeased by my explanation and asked me to return to my desk. \n\nAn hour later, my director was escorted out of the building. \n\nTL;DR\nMy boss asked me to adjust some numbers so the company wouldn\u2019t be impacted by financial penalties. After arguing and him threatening my job, I did what he asked. But I out a disclaimer on the chart that the numbers were changed. He was fired for demanding I fudge the numbers.",

And when her supervisor got suspicious and did a count of her own it came back over $1000 off because she had been changing numbers for over a month.

One fine evening, he makes an offer to me. He said he would artificially increase the cost on each invoice and we would split the share 50/50. Little did he know that my phone was recording the call. I went straight to my manager, told him that he will have to be very careful about people joining after me (I was on a notice period of 3 months, had already resigned) and played the call recording. He understood what it meant and how the previous guy managed to live a luxurious life. He told me that he had always trusted me and that's the reason he had tried his best to retain me the last time I had resigned.\n\nThe transport company lost a very valuable client. My ex-manager is the one who authorises invoices now.",

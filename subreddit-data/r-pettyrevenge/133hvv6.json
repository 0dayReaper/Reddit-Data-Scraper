    "postText": "This isn't my neighbor but my aunts, she's been having issues with them for years now. They're the type of neighbor to take pictures of your yard and sent it to the city to complain (they did this 3 times) the wife even approached my aunt and told her how she complained to the city. \nThis specific neighbor doesn't have a parking space, however my aunt does but she doesn't drive. For years she has allowed them to use her street parking space without complaint even with them reporting/bullying her. About 4 years ago they asked my aunts permission to do some building work on my aunts porch so that they could make a parking space, they would take half of my aunts porch, she said no. They got mad and told her they'd do it anyway, my aunt complained to the city and the city said if they start building work to call the police. \n\nFor weeks it was radio silent and once again my aunt was approached by the husband asking her once again if they could take half of her porch and once again she said no, he got mad and asked why and started bashing my aunt telling her she doesn't even own the home and how he doesn't need permission. My aunt use to share a small back fence with these people but they build a taller fence on their side and then knocked the old fence into my aunts backyard, she saw the husband with a metal pipe doing this. I got so mad and asked my aunt why she didn't call the cops? That's criminal damage but my aunt doesn't want any problems with these people. They also on occasion have house parties from 9pm till the early hours playing loud music and my aunt has never called the cops on them, yet when my aunt had a small barbecue party at 12pm on a Saturday they called the cops on her, they must've made some nonsense up as the cops did show up and were as confused as we were\n\nOn a visit to my aunts house i parked my car in her parking spot and within 20 minutes the husband comes banging on the door, i open it and he starts screaming at me to move my car. I say no and before i can shut the door in his face he puts his foot in the door preventing me from closing it at that point i was mad and told him he better move his foot before i call the cops as he is scaring me, he backs off and tells me i better move my car or he'll be the one calling the cops. \n\nMy aunt recently passed her driving theory test and once she passes her practical test she can drive, so I decided to buy her a car just to fuck with the neighbors. Now they have no parking space. Yes they were really mad but what can they do? It's her space and she doesn't even drive yet so it just sits there collecting dust.\n\nIf they were nice decent people my aunt might have just let them have part of her porch but from day one they acted like pieces of shit\n\nEdit- \n\nMore information they have being trying to do this porch thing for years now when my aunt first moved in the wife came up to her and told my aunt that the previous tenant was racist and that  he said black people had no right to parking spaces. Initially my aunt believed them but once she saw how they behaved I am sure that they used the same bullying tactics on the older gentleman who lived here before my aunt",

So one day I come home and his parents are visiting and have parked in my spot I knock on the door and tell them to move it it\u2019s my spot. They say but you don\u2019t have a car I tell them my mums coming to mine and will park there so move it. The dad tells me if and when my mum comes he will move it. I called the local council reported it and then called my mum she came and he moved the car. After he does my mum tells him never to park there again as it\u2019s not his space we are each assigned one. He tries to shit talk my mum but she shuts that down. The next day he\u2019s outside bitching with my neighbors that I don\u2019t even use the space (thanks to his son). So the next day I bought a garden table and chairs and set them out in the middle of the space. He called the council saying I was taking the mick. They told him the space is mine to use included in my rent however I choose lol \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019d go out and sit and have a drink whenever his dad had to park on the street. Issue with parking on the street is that we had a few people who shouldn\u2019t be driving and one time they side swiped his car. I sat and had my drink and waved as they passed me",

If she is renting, she should make the landlord aware. Anytime they have loud parties that go on into the wee hours, they should be reported. Someone should also photograph these people and report them for every single infraction. Allowing these jerks to get away with this BS sends the wrong message.\n\n*ETA: Under ordinary circumstances I would never complain about my neighbors having a loud party but they would never do this very often. Where I live, we notify and invite the neighbors when we know a party may be late and loud and they do the same.  However, in the case of OP's neighborhood terrorists, they've abused their privileges as neighbors and they are not entitled to another drop of anyone's grace. Reporting neighbors whenever they have a party that is late and loud should be the exception and not the rule but THIS case calls for an exception to be made and I would call the cops on them every single time.*",

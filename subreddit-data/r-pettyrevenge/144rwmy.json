    "postText": "This actually happened many years ago now, but I was dining at a restaurant with friends around 9ish in the evening - not a fancy restaurant by any means, but an affordable, delicious option that\u2019s always open late. It wasn\u2019t busy and there was one very bored waitress who looked to be in her 40s.\n\nShe put on a perky face and took our orders. Being a picky eater, I asked for a burger with no lettuce or tomato. I\u2019d ordered the exact thing dozens of times before with no real issues, but something was \u201coff\u201d about this waitress\u2026\n\n\u201cIt comes with the lettuce and tomato, honey,\u201d she said, like I was stupid.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I laughed, thinking she was just teasing me at first. \u201cI just want the cheese though.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just comes like that. That\u2019s how we make it - with lettuce and tomato,\u201d she said in a matter-of-fact way.\n\nI looked at my friends for some sort of help and only received dumbfounded looks in return.\n\n\u201cUhm,\u201d I said as nicely as I could. \u201cWould you just leave the lettuce and tomato\u2026 off?\u201d\n\nI was waiting for her to understand, but she acted like I was speaking nonsense.\n\n\u201cSorry, but that\u2019s JUST how we make it,\u201d she replied, clearly annoyed now. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t like it, just pick it off, sweetie!\u201d\n\nShe finished taking our orders while I sat there, stunned. Picking off lettuce and tomato is easy enough, sure. But on rare occasions that the restaurant had forgotten to leave it off for me in the past, it usually left the bun soggy and tasting of the toppings I disliked\u2026 hence why I asked for it not to be assembled that way. And I did everything I could - in my very confused state of mind - to be polite to this woman, especially because I started to wonder if she was 1) on drugs, 2) fucking with me to win a bet, or 3) profoundly stupid.\n\nI did end up receiving a burger with lettuce and tomato (surprise, surprise) and the bun was soaked by the questionable-looking, piled-on tomatoes. It even looked like they had even managed to add more toppings than usual, and I wondered what I ever could have done to this strange waitress to make her fuck with my hunger like that. Did I hurt her in a past life?\n\nI asked if I could at least get a fresh burger bun because it was so watery, and she just looked at me, exasperated, and said, \u201cThis again?? Just pick it off! It\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d\n\nI never made a scene, I never asked to speak to a manager, and I ate my fries and the parts of the burger I liked. I honestly don\u2019t really like confrontation, but I did get a bit of petty revenge in the end\u2026\n\nOn the table, I left her the oldest, dirtiest one-dollar bill from my friend\u2019s wallet as a tip (because you should always tip your servers!) but I put the lettuce and tomato on top of that nasty dollar bill with a note, saying: \u201cJust pick it off, sweetie!\u201d\n\nI wish I could\u2019ve seen her face\u2026\n\n*Edit to add a few things:\n\n1) The \u201calways tip your servers\u201d bit was supposed to be in a mocking tone, since that\u2019s what people always say. \ud83d\ude02 I didn\u2019t convey that well enough, so I wanted to clarify that I\u2019m aware I didn\u2019t have to tip.\n\n2) For those of you saying I shouldn\u2019t have tipped at all, how else was I supposed to leave the toppings for her?? \ud83d\ude0e That dollar wasn\u2019t a loss. It had been in my friend\u2019s wallet for over a year and was so soft and deteriorated I doubt many establishments would\u2019ve even accepted it as payment (especially after being soaked in tomato). I really hope it was bad enough that she had to make a special trip to the bank to replace it.\n\n3) For those of you calling me names or referring to me as \u201ctoo soft\u201d or whatever because I didn\u2019t stand up for myself in a really bizarre situation that confused the hell out of me, this was almost a decade ago and I was much more anxious and shy back then; I was in my early 20s at the time and working through some trauma, blah blah blah. You don\u2019t really need to know my childhood story. But I did my best then. And these days I\u2019ll gladly tell you to fuck off for being rude or calling me names - online or in person. I mean, is it some sort of weird kink or power play for those of you calling out a presumably skittish person rude names? That\u2019s fucked up.",

She said when she got it it tasted a little odd, but she rarely drank soda anyway so she didn't really think about it.  She drank two or three glasses and then began to experience symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).\n\nTook out her kit and tested her blood, she said the reading was so high it pinned at the upper end of the meter's range.  She called the waitress over and asked if she'd been given Diet Coke like she ordered, only for the waitress to reply \"Oh, I served you regular instead.  You didn't need Diet, you're thin enough.\"\n\nNow legitimately enraged, the woman demanded to see the manager, then, while injecting all the insulin she had with her, informed him that she was diabetic, what the waitress had done, and that not only would she not be paying for her meal, she would be billing him for the insulin she was wasting, along with the ER visit she was about to take.\n\n(Edit - autocarrot ducked me again!  Changed 'hypoglycemia' to the correct 'hyperglycemia')",

I'm the only one in the family that can reliably taste sugared sodas since they were all that was available for school parties - all we had at home was diet and enough restaurants sucked at getting mixes right that most of the time the mix was just \"off\" so I turned into the \"confirmed sugar\" tester.\n\nDad tastes his drink and says it tastes off and hands it to me.  Immediately I know it's sugared Coke so we head back inside to get it fixed.  Girl at front apologizes and goes to fill it up.  The thing about Wendy's at this time was that the only soda machine was used by staff, but you could see the labels from the customer's side.  I immediately notice she's on the wrong side filling it up with Coke - again.  I tell her and she's confused swearing it's diet.  We go back and forth and this chucklefuck busts out laughing from the back.  It was April 1st and this smooth brain decided to switch the face plates on the new girl to cause issues.\n\nDad was peeved and explained that he could have caused a serious medical emergency - just trying to teach the teen that it was wrong from a safety standpoint to mess with food/drink and just wanted a basic apology.  Kid was still laughing and said something along of \"whatever, don't care\".  My mom and I immediately grabbed dad because it's the first time I've seen him angry enough to possibly kill someone.\n\nGirl fixes the drink and profusely apologizes.  Dad gets home and immediately contacts Wendy's corporate regarding the issue about how a guy thought it was funny he could kill my dad.  Manager contacts within 48H saying he spoke with the girl running register and confirmed the incident and his attitude.  Wendy's provided around $200 worth of vouchers, manager fired his ass, and the manager let other fast food joints/businesses know he was a liability (small town).",

Probably over dosed herself. She told the new-ish manager (who was a dick) that she needed to eat something because her blood sugar was low. He told her that she was just being a greedy pig and trying to get a free snack. And besides, she just had a break and just wanted another one. She tried to remind him about her diabetes, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. Her coworkers all stood up for her and pleaded with him, but he accused her of getting them to lie for her. She\u2019s sweating and shaking at this point so she went in the back to supposedly work, and her friend snuck her a juice and a cookie. I was FUMING when she told me and wanted to have him strung up by his balls, but she insisted that she wanted to handle it herself. I did talk to the good assistant manager to make sure it was reported and it was. He was transferred out but I don\u2019t think he was fired. I hope he gets shingles all over his body and other painful debilitating illnesses.",

And unfortunately a lot of it is because people act like this and pull the \"it's no big deal\" so my allergy isn't seen the same way a peanut allergy would be looked at. I had one waiter tell me that the last time he spoke with someone with gluten \"allergies\" they told him that the fryer killed the gluten so it was still safe.

Like pizza places that use the same ladle in the same bucket of sauce to spread sauce on the GF crusts as they do regular ones. She says that she knows that if I tell her something is GF, the only way it isn't is if a manufacturer mislabeled something as GF when it wasn't. I spend 2 hours removing anything from my kitchen that I won't be using, so I don't risk anything being on it. Then I  hand clean every surface, utensil, etc. In my kitchen, and everything in it that MIGHT be touched. And I wash my hands throughout the process with a gf soap.  And nothing gets made in that kitchen or brought into that kitchen that isn't GF until her food is in a sealed container. \n\nI have a lot of medical issues that are very sensitive (including a mast cell activation issue, which my SIL always says is like her Celiac sensitivities on steroids). I know how a single mistake/action can make someone miserable, whether intentional or not.",

They had two chicken sandwiches on the menu, one on a wheat bun with a honey mustard spread and the other on grilled bread(which means oiled bread)with cheese and mayo.  I was trying to make healthier choices so I ordered the one on the wheat bun.  I was very specific about it but the waitress brought the wrong one.  I pointed that out politely and asked for the other one.  She took it away but came back and asked if the chef could just move the chicken to a bun.  I said no because I didn\u2019t want cheese and mayo. I asked if they could just make the sandwich I ordered.  She left but came back a few minutes later and told me that the chef said he could just scrape off the fillet and reheat it.  Please, please just give me the one I ordered!  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

He just doesn\u2019t like seasoning. Both of them like their burgers without even any catch up. Meat, cheese, bun.  That\u2019s it.

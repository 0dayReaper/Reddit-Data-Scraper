    "postText": "This is a revenge in progress! \n\nTo get to the point, this year early march ny orthopaedic doctor noticed a deformity in my wrists which makes me unable to do a lot of things such as lifting heavy things without a brace or writing for long periods of time.\n\nI have a teacher who fails to acknowledge this as she makes us write on the daily about 3 or 4 pages of work in the lesson plus as homework.(My major is about sales/marketing/company leading stuff, I don\u2019t  know how to translate this major.) Two teachers teach this subject, switching between lessons. The other teacher explains it to us in just a couple of sentences which is roughly about a page or a page and a half total, lets call this teacher Mr. William. But we are not talking about him today. The other teacher, let's call her Mrs. Laura.\n\nAs I've mentioned above, I cannot write for long periods of time, so her classes are obviously a pain to be in. When I was diagnosed I've told her about it personally and what she said basically comes down to \"I don't care. It's your problem not mine so solve it.\" So since September I've been struggling to keep up with her classes and her ridiculous method of teaching. Recently, I found my grandmother's typewriter and it still works just as well as it did 35 years ago. \"Why a typewriter?\" you might ask. It's because my printer doesn't work.(plus I like old things)\n\nMrs Laura doesn't like it when someone does something different from her plans or says the same thing but differently as her when she asks a question and she will just yell at you saying, \"on the exam they won't accept this! You will just fail and then you can go and sweep the streets for the rest of your life!\" (I am not exaggerating, she really said this.) She likes to put us down emotionally when we don't answer something correctly. She's super dramatic about it, immediately assuming we know nothing.\n\nAnyway back to the typewriter, she has given us a bunch of assignments with a ridiculously short deadline so I will take the liberty of accommodating myself and not I injure myself just for her happiness. Because no way in hell that I am doing 4 assignments that are about 3 pages long each. Typing it is faster and easier for me. Besides, she never said we cannot print out, or in my case, type it down, what she sends us through the Kr\u00e9ta app, (it's an app that students use to check their curriculum, homework and grades. Also where teachers put in homework and grades. Teachers can check our attendance records, homework, grades, etc.)\n\nI will update y'all once she's back. She's currently on sick leave or a break.\n\nEdit:\n\nUpdate! \n\nShe is back at it again, and only gave me one F so far for answering the question. (Question was to describe how making an offer on a product is, I'm learning store management something) I am still typing out some of the stuff she's sent to us and I am going to hand it in tomorrow.\n\nFor those that have asked me if I could use a laptop for taking notes, yes I can. I asked around, even the school principal (SP) and she said its alright and not against school rules or anything. And as if a miracle happened, she allowed it. The SP also had a talk with her about this.\n\nI'll update everyone again once I've handed in the papers.\n\nUpdate 2! \n\nSo, She didn't let me hand it all in because she wasn't really interested in those so I'll try again on Tuesday (she won't be available on Monday) and hopefully by then I've finished with all assignments and will be ready to hand them in.\n\nFinal update! \n\nSo I brought her the typewriter notes and she wasn't exactly happy about them and I think I will continue doing this even next year but taking it up a notch. I'm going to buy a tablet to use in class for notes to type everything down on it and she won't be able to do anything about that. Yesterday I've gone to the doctor who checked my wrists and told me the reason it hurts in an inflammation in the carpal tunnel. He told me to rest my hands and not to excessive writing.",

At the same time you would like some protection against a 'pain in the ass' teacher.\nInstead of a typewriter you can use a laptop, and nowadays you can easily use that for transcripting her lectures to written text. Piece of cake, just some adjustments needed afterwards. NB: my experience is that making a 'full transcription' also makes clearly visible the flaws in lectures given, and can protect you in case of future disputes.\nLast but not least I expect this approach to be much safer for your health. Good Luck.",

If you know it can be explained in two sentences, then sounds like you should be teaching. Could be she developed this technique over the years because being too concise didn't work for some students. She's not doing anything wrong. If you expect all teachers to teach according to your wrists, you are in for a ride awakening.",

Most of the time she explains a word with a synonym and you just gotta figure it out yourself. Both teachers teach us the same thing. One explains it in an unnecessarily long manner, telling you to learn it before the exam, which is an impossible amount, while the other teacher explains it in a few words or sentences, in basically bite size pieces that get straight to the point\nwhich are easier to learn and memorise than her novels.",

OP is saying that the teacher says something one way, but doesn\u2019t allow the students to say the same answer in a different way. It\u2019s like her saying \u201cthe ball is the color red and bounces high\u201d and students saying \u201cthe red bouncy ball\u201d but she takes that as an incorrect answer is what I\u2019m getting from the post.

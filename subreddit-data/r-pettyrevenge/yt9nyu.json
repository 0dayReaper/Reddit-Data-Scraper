    "postText": "Many years ago I worked for an organization providing front-line customer service. It was a decent place to work but our manager had lots of rules. One of the rules was that we could not do any personal printing with the printers at work. If we did, we were expected to pay $0.50 per page for black and white printing and $1.00 per page for color. I'm not sure who made this rule but the manager was constantly reminding us.\n\nOur desks were not assigned. Meaning, any day you could be sitting at any desk, depending on your assigned tasks for the day.\n\nOne day, I was interviewing for another job within the organization (but at another location) . Prior to the interview, the manager of the other location asked me if I'd mind printing a copy of my resume and bringing it with me as their printers were down for the day. I said no problem and figured I'd print it at work since it was work related.\n\nI was sitting at a desk that did not have a printer at it. The closest printer was located between my managers desk and an employee desk. So I printed it and stood up to go get it.\n\nBefore I go to the printer, my manager got there first. My print job went ahead of hers. When she saw what I had printed she said, \"OP, this looks like a personal print job.\" I explained it wasn't but she disagreed and said since it had nothing to do with our day-to-day work, I had to pay. $2.00 for four black and white pages. I begrudgingly paid up. I asked her what happened to the money and she said she always put it in the Christmas party fund. Alright.\n\nA few weeks later, I was sitting at the desk with the printer at it. It was lunchtime and everyone except my manager agreed to go to a nearby restaurant for lunch. I had walked out our building and realized I forgot my wallet. So I quickly ran back in to get it. When I got to my desk, I could hear the printer going. I was curious what was being printed as it was spitting out page after page. I quickly glanced at the pile and saw at least 100 pages printed in color, announcing a sweet 16 for Trista, our manager's daughter. It very obviously belonged to my manager. My manager came out of the bathroom a moment later and seemed shocked to see me standing there. I picked up the pile and passed it to her and told her our Christmas party fund was going to be getting a big boost. She said nothing but looked really uncomfortable.\n\nA few weeks later, our district manager made his quarterly visit. He talked about the upcoming Christmas party and how excited he was for it. I decided it was time for some petty revenge. I raised my hand and said, \"just wondering how much we've accumulated this year for the Christmas party from print jobs?\" He looked so confused and asked me to explain what I meant. So I told him our manager's rule. He got really quiet and said he'd have to review this.\n\nThe next day my manager sent an email saying the printing rule was something she was misinformed on and would be abolished immediately. Me, being the little shit disturber I am, hit reply all and asked what would happen to the already accumulated funds? Someone else said we should have a nice healthy fund for a pizza lunch and everyone agreed.\n\nThe next day I hear my manager ordering 10 pizzas for lunch. Also used her own personal credit card to pay for it all. Do I think she was pocketing the printing money all along? Absolutely. But it was fun making her sweat and then having to spend nearly $300 the next day to make up for it!\n\nEDIT : $30 for a large pizza is very standard where I'm from. I ordered a pizza for supper last night and with tax, tip and delivery I paid $36. Our manager ordered us pizza from Boston Pizza (Canadian chain). Google them and you'll see their prices.",

I took it upon myself to start collecting cans and bottles and taking them in for the money and using it to buy pizza for our department (light shipping) - we did everything except the large rolls of paper that were cut down to all the paper you ever used at elementary and middle and high school. Light shipping supplied paints for art class and colored and number 2 pencils and clay and cutting boards - things like that. Well one girl, we will call her Willa, because that was her name, she would drink a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi daily and toss the bottle in the trash for me to dig out. I asked her so nicely often to leave it out for me but she liked to be a bitch and make me dig through the garbage for it. She did this as I accumulated bag after bag of recycling- $60 worth of memory serves me right. I planned a pizza day and of course Willa the whale decides she wants to take the day off and tells me not to have the pizza party the day she\u2019s going to be out. I went ahead and did it anyway. She complained to the office. I told them what happened as well and it all blew over but everyone kind of knew what was up",

Hmmmm, who could be printing on the weekend? So I wandered around to the W&amp;S dept and here was the printer, putting out invitations to the deputy manager's daughter's 21st birthday party. Dozens of copies of a cheap, MSPaint-quality invitation flyer. Hearts and flowers icons, etc.\n\nThe deputy manager wasn't around - maybe he'd set it going and went out for a coffee - so I gathered up the entire output and took it to a bin on another floor.\n\nIt pissed me off that \\*my\\* rates were being used to pay for this twit's invitations.",

Moron suggested \u00a3x could be saved by buying \"cloned\" printer cartridges. Worked well for about two months. Everyone was slapping themselves on the back, how much money had been saved.\n\nThen they all stopped working. Not only did they stop working but the printers were fouled. HP came out. Fixed 'em all but warned they wouldn't again. This leaves govt with a year's supply of cloned cartridges. Morons breed morons so the decision was made: fuck it. HP have just serviced them all, it'll be okay. So in went the cloned cartridges. Out come HP again. Breach of contract. Faced with the bill govt decided to change suppliers. Replaced all the HP printers with Kyocera (which went on a different budeting account).\n\nThe downside was each &amp; every page was accounted for and costed. Size. Colour. Ink. It was all very clever and pissed off govt employees because office girls had to use their swipe card to photocopy their arse, not knowing \"the database\" now knew who'se arse it was.\n\nAnyway. With all that out the way. Kyocera had a unix interface. Govt being windoze orientated never even entered their minds to change that from stock settings.\n\nConsequently us linux contractors were free to print out entire manuals &amp; if any of us had had girlfriends they could have got their arse done for free. :-)",

Once years ago I was secretary of the company sponsored bowling league. The company would pay for the end of year banquet, but wouldn\u2019t pay for alcohol. At the time a half barrel cost $60, which worked out to $2/bowler out of the league fees. Someone thought we should have gotten the place to increase the price on the banquet by $2/person and then the beer would be covered by that, and I was like \u201cdo you really want to risk our jobs for $2?\u201d",

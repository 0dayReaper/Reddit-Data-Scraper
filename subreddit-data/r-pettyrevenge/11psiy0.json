    "postText": "So, I'm a bridal stylist. I help people find their wedding gown. I love my job, and 99% of the time, it's a happy, wonderful job with great coworkers and customers. \n\nAnd then there's the 1%.\n\nI had a bride today who was very sweet, but just didn't connect with the gowns we had. That's okay; it happens sometimes. She was fine. But her mom (and somehow, it's always the mom or the aunt) was decidedly not happy, and decided to shit-talk me in Spanish the whole time. \n\n\"Does this woman know what she's' doing? She's pulling nothing but ugly gowns!\" (Said gowns were selected by the bride.) \"I hope you don't ever get as fat as her.\" And so on. Lovely.\n\nNow, I am whiter than a jar of mayo, and I don't necessarily look like I speak Spanish. However, my parents are from a Spanish-speaking country, even though they're not ethnically Hispanic. I knew a LOT more as a kid, but l still know enough to get around.\n\nSo I waited until the end, and as they were leaving, I said \"I hope you have a great day. Please, feel free to come back any time you'd like; we have lots more gowns you can go through if you'd like\" in Spanish, to the bride and her mom, and oh man... \n\nYou know how good it feels when you're in a fuckton of pain, and the doctor finally gives you something that works, and you're suddenly not feeling any pain anymore? Or when you're craving the hell out of a specific flavor of ice cream and you manage to find it?\n\nYeah, seeing the look on that bride's mom's face when she realized I heard and understood the entire hour of her ripping me to shreds was SO much better.",

It\u2019s great learning later in life but boy it\u2019s much easier when young when the mind is more elastic, literally expands the brains neural network. \n\nBilingualism gives kids a huge leg up in life, is valuable in the real world for social reasons and often increases social mobility.. kids end up better financially since it literally opens up job choices. \n\nI was exposed to 2 language when in school and while brief and shallow has stuck with me for decades. Ended up continuing to learn a third language later in life (now dabble in how linguistics works as a hobby).. hard but worth it. True what they say, never stop learning!",

Our tour group is moving quickly, and the guide tells us to just find a seat, we'll be getting off in a few blocks. I rush to the back to the 1st empty seat, which happens to be in the middle of a group of highschool age girls.\n\nAt this time I was a moderately good looking young white male, thin, tallish, and full head of hair still. As soon as I sit down, one girl says to the girl I've sat next to \"I think he likes you, he sat right next to you!\"\n\n\"Shutup\" this girl says.\n\nHer friend continues to pester the girl next to me. \"Say hi, he's pretty! Maybe he's staying in town tonight\"\n\n\"I said shutup!\" This poor girl cries.\n\nThey keep talking like this, until my tour guide tells us it's our stop, we go to get off the bus... I couldn't resist. I turned to the girl who was sat next to me as I get up, and in Spanish say \"quizas el proximo vez\" (Maybe next time). The girls all scream as I turn around laughing... I felt super cool",

                    "comment": "I was studying abroad in Madrid and my friends and I were going out clubbing on one of our last nights in town. A guy targeted our group, hearing us speaking English and thinking we were tourists. He tried to pickpocket me. Of course I didn't have anything valuable in my purse. I slammed my hand down on my bag, trapping his hand in it and started cursing at him in Spanish, drawing the eyes of everyone on the train. I suspect he realized he picked a poor target.\n\nHe finally slunk off the train at the next stop empty handed. \n\nFunny enough, almost the exact same thing happened to my mom in Paris when my family was visiting. The thieves were a couple and the guy dropped a coat in front of my dad to distract him. My parents are both from Queens and their alarm bells went off. My mom trapped the woman's hand in her purse and yelled in her college French. She told everyone on the train the couple was working together. Again, no money in her purse.\n\nUsually you have to get old before you enjoy taking after your parents, but I started early.\n\nI realize it's only tangentially language related. We did fall into the habit of speaking English on the train as if it was a private conversation, until someone nearby would start laughing at a joke one of us made (reminding us English is not a secret code language). It happened dozens of times and was fun each and every one. I adore Madridenas.",

Unfortunately it left her with some pretty severe deficits, on top of the dementia she already had. Her family was in the room chatting amongst themselves. I come in and introduce myself to the family and start doing my normal cares for her. Like the assessment, meds, blah blah blah. Im talking to her like I had been the last 3 nights I had her, but this is the first time her family was in the room. \nNow- I should mention she only speaks Japanese. I had her because I took several years of Japanese in undergrad and I\u2019m at a conversational level. But because of her confusion and dementia she usually just responded with \u201cwhat? Huh? Hmm? What? What?\u201d So I would just narrate what I\u2019m doing to her after asking a few normal questions. But because her family greeted me in English I was asking my questions all in English. \nThen they start trashing me in Japanese. Talking about how it\u2019s dumb I\u2019m asking how she is, she can\u2019t answer. How I\u2019m dumb for even trying to talk to her. Why am I telling her what her pills are. Why am I telling her what I\u2019m doing. When am I going to leave. Why am I so fat. Why am I so dumb. Just so on and so on.  \nAnyway, I wrap up with the patient. Then turn to the family and in Japanese I tell them I\u2019m going to go attend to other patients, but to feel free to hit the call light if they have any questions or need anything. And then reminded them that visiting hours ended at 8pm.",

Standard stupid guy talk but a good way to become unemployed. \n\nI also had a red haired Irish guy who grew up in New Mexico and worked for his dad's landscaping company then he moved up here to Virginia. We put him out on an install crew. Looked like the last guy in the world you thought would speak Spanish. The entire day the Foreman was talking shit about him in Spanish and he just ignored it and pretended he didn't understand. Then about 2:00 in the afternoon he walked up to the foreman and in perfect Spanish and said Hey, I'm done with everything you asked me to do. What do you want me to do for the rest of the day?

One of the guys who worked with him only spoke Spanish so he basically had to learn Spanish or never speak to this guy, which wasn\u2019t an option. \n\nNow we live in an area that has lots of Central America laborers but not a lot of people speak Spanish and they LOVE my husband bc he can actually do business with them in their language (although he tells me Honduran Spanish is apparently different from Mexican Spanish but they can at least get the point across to each other). It\u2019s always funny when they bring a new guy in though, they tell him like right out of the gate that my husband speaks Spanish, and he 100% knows it\u2019s so that guy doesn\u2019t talk smack around him.",

The other friend started commenting on what other people were wearing and seemed to particularely have a nasty comment about a woman and her combo of colours, wondered if her mom had dressed her since the colours didn\u2019t match. And said something in the line of who would dress like that because that skirt and jacket combo didn\u2019t match. Must have been a lull in the music or something because all of a sudden the woman turns around and tells the friend, in finnish, that she surely dressed herself and that the friend shouldn\u2019t piss on other peoples clothes like that. My friend had been quiet so far but by now she had said she had had enough and just wanted out of there.\n\nI laughed when she told me this after the vacation and said something in the lines of her friend getting a lesson and not doing that again but she looked really upset when I said that. Told me that they had gone to another pub the next evening and the friend had asked in a loud voice if anyone spoke finnish there. When no-one has answered, she had started the same running commentary about peoples clothes and styles again.\n\nThis was several years ago and they are no longer friends. Wonder why?",

            "comment": "I've never learned to speak Spanish, however way back at the dawn of time when I was in high school I took Latin. So I can sometimes follow a conversation in Spanish a little. At one time I worked for a garment manufacturer and it was generally known that I didn't speak Spanish. One of the guys decided he'd teach me some Spanish so I was learning more as time went on, 1 orc2 words or phrases at a time.   I never let on that I was learning to follow what the guys said fairly well- till the day I saw one of the guys asleep on a stack of fabric and stopped to see if he was okay. And he snarled at me and used a word I didn't recognize, so I went to the fabric supervisor and asked what that word meant. There was a big crowd of 10-15 guys around his desk at the time and he asked what I needed, so I asked him what that word meant. The whole place got as quiet as death and there were a bunch of big wide eyes when he asked me  \"Where did you hear THAT?!\" I told him and he took off running in that direction. (It was easy for him to take off like that because the 10-15 guys all turned into puffs of smoke when I said that.) He never would tell me what it meant- I had to talk someone else into telling me what it was. Then there was the day I went to him with a problem, he told a guy what I needed - in Spanish- and it was wrong so I corrected him ( in english). He corrected it with the guy, then as the guy walked away from his desk the supervisor got this shocked look on his face and said \"wait- I thought you couldn't speak Spanish?!\" , to which I replied \"i can't but that doesn't mean I can't understand it.\"\n\nShocked face- I could tell he was trying to think if he had said anything that he wouldn't want me to hear...my supervisor laughed till he cried when I told him about that.",

When I was home for the holidays my mom just couldn't handle it any more and tricked me into getting a haircut by asking for my help buying some things at the hardware store, on the way back home she stopped at the first place she saw. I had a beard as well and since I was carrying a bunch of pavers and gardening stuff I wore this really ratty shirt so I wouldn't blame anyone if they had assumed I was homeless.\n\nWhen I walk in the woman made a remark to the other women in the salon about my appearance in Spanish. She cuts my hair and towards the end of the haircut where I'm from finally comes up. I grew up in Latin America but I spent a lot of years in the US so I have virtually no accent so when I mention where I am from she starts to get nervous. She sheepishly asks if I speak Spanish and I start to respond to her questions in Spanish as the other women in the studio start snickering, she went quiet for the rest of the haircut. \n\nWhen I got up from the chair one of the women remarked about how nice I looked, the way your grandma would so I got to walk out feeling both smug and confident.",

I was annoyed because I was worried about getting some infection. I asked the nail tech to please not cut my cuticles anymore. She starts shit talking about how I\u2019m being difficult to her coworkers. No one else really says anything back to her. Now I\u2019m pissed, so I stand up and tell her never mind, I\u2019m leaving and I will just pay for the work that\u2019s been done. \n\nOne of the other employees (maybe manager?) turns around and asks what\u2019s wrong. The salon is packed and it\u2019s all caucasians. I\u2019m the only Asian in the nail salon besides the employees. I said loudly that I don\u2019t appreciate the tech shit talking about me while I\u2019m sitting there. She\u2019s the one that keeps nicking me and causing me to bleed because she\u2019s not paying attention. The tech says she\u2019s isn\u2019t and they\u2019re talking about something else. I replied I may not look Asian to you but I understand your language. You can stop lying. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t continue to talk shit about all the customers in here. You never know who else speaks it as well. Everyone is staring at the tech as I walk out. Was satisfied letting everyone know they were being talked about.

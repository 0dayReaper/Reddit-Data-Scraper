    "postText": "I once had an acquaintance who borrowed a considerable amount of money from me, and for a while everything was fine, he paid his debt in installments and I did not pressurize him. But here's an incident, he writes that he can't pay me back this month and will pay me back next month as for two months. I took it calmly and got into his position. The next month comes, and then he starts coming up with all sorts of excuses, and eventually he stops contacting me at all. And it's been three months since he last gave me money. In the end, I got tired of putting up with it and decided to go to his house to talk to him and find out what the problem was.\r  \n\r  \n(Prestory before the next part. In my country is a mandatory military service dalsh you will understand why this information).\r  \n\r  \nSo I go to his house. Just hoping to find out what the problem is. He opens the door and asks to go outside, because his family is at home and he doesn't want to discuss it in front of them. We go outside, and I just try to start a dialogue and find out what happened. He reacts strangely, starts yelling at me, insulting me, even though it was me who owed him the money. And I did not rush to return, and calmly waited for a certain part of the debt every month. Well, I also start shouting back and a passerby notices and calls the police. I think there is a scuffle. We did not notice how they arrived at all. So they come up to us and ask what is going on. I try to explain, so there won't be any unnecessary problems, that everything is normal and this is some kind of mistake, that we are having an ordinary argument. The police seemed to believe me, but decided to check the documents anyway. And then I notice my friend getting worried. He says that he has no documents, they are at home. Although we are three steps away from his apartment and there was no problem to go up to get the documents, he was silent about it. Then the police officer asked to give his name and surname to check in the database. And then he had no choice and had to say his name. After that, they went away and discussed something for a long time. I look at my friend, and he is in a panic. Then the police came back and said that he had to go with them. And in the end it turned out that he had been hiding from military service for 5 years, he had an unofficial job, and they just couldn't find him. I remind you that military service in my country is compulsory. Of course, it wasn't a special revenge, but I think it was just justice that played a role. I'm sorry the story is so stretched out.",

But I refused, because it was purely our business and I didn't want his family involved. But after a while his mother forced me to take the money. At the same time I was glad that there was justice, but also embarrassed that his mom had to give most likely her money back.",

    "postText": "Obligatory I'm-on-mobile disclaimer. \n\nI work in a theatre, and it's not uncommon for audience members to cheekily try and move into seats they see are empty. On quieter days, it's not a huge issue, however our unspoken policy is: wait until the interval, because we have a late seating policy and those seats may have been sold to someone else. Or at the very least, ask. \n\nOn this day a while back we were fairly full (not to the brim, but enough), and I was supervising. My usher told me a woman moved a few rows forward and was argumentative when asked to move back, which she eventually did. Now, I don't have a problem with people moving along a few seats in the same row, because it's easy enough for them to shuffle back if they have happened to take up someone else's seat. But I draw the line at changing rows, especially when they have just been told no.\n\nWell, the lights go down and the woman immediately moves back to the seat she was told she could not have yet (without her husband mind you!). And I go up to her and explain our policy and she flat out refuses to move. She says in a very entitled and dismissive tone, \"If someone comes, I will move.\" \n\nRight then. I was now feeling petty and righteous. \n\nDuring late seating we wait for people for about ten minutes then let them in at the least disruptive time in the play. Alas, the seat the woman had taken hadn't been sold, but I had a plan, for I was on a mission! \n\nThere was a couple set to be seated in the highest level ie the cheap seats, that I offered an upgrade to, because I could see the woman had trouble walking. My usher escorted them in, and I was delighted to hear about the woman trying to tell my usher (a different one to the one she initially interacted with) that she will move when people come. My usher said point blank, \"People are coming. You have to move.\" The woman's husband leaned across, grabbed her and guided her back, looking quite embarrassed I'm told.\n\nDuring the interval, I could see her surly, pouty face. Glorious. \n\nThe irony is: had she asked nicely, I'd have been happy to help.",

I'm also fully disabled with a decent amount of metal in one knee. It's very hard for me to sit with my leg bent, especially for hours. The theater also has boxed seats that are just chairs in a small room. When we saw the box was empty my mom politely asked if we might upgrade our tickets to sit in that room. The theater, very nicely, let us do it for free. The next time we went the box area was part of the show, no such luck (we'd tried to book box seats but they weren't available, so it wasn't a surprise). So I crammed my leg in and (with his knowledge and permission) half kicked my husband repeatedly for 2 hours. \n\nThe entitlement of people is shocking. Almost constantly anymore.",

            "comment": "A few years back - my friends and I bought 10 seats at a sold out showing of some marvel movie on opening day. This was before the theatre started making every ticket purchase have an assigned seat. So we got there super early and were in the front of the queue. We were there long enough to talk to darn near every employee there.\n\nWhen released, we rushed to the middle and \u201creserved\u201d (with jackets) 5 seats on one role, and 5 right above. I stayed in the above-center seat to ward off any seat pirates\u2026 or\u2026 whatever. The rest of my friends went for popcorn and drinks. People are starting to trickle in.\n\nWhile playing on my phone, a woman in an ugly red hat came by and started scooping up the coats in front of me. She was followed by 3 kids (who probably shouldn\u2019t have been in this PG-13 movie, but whatever.)\n\n\u201cExcuse me, those are taken.\u201d I said\n\n\u201cMind your business.\u201d She replied, as she unceremoniously dumped my friends coats on the end of the row and put her kids jackets down in the middle seats.\n\nI was in awe. A wild Karen just took our seats and I was kinda in shock. I looked around at other patrons in a \u2018are you **also** seeing this?\u2019 Kinda way.\n\nShe took her kids to go get popcorn (presumably) and as soon as she rounded the corner I went into action.\n\nI scooped up Karen\u2019s coats, ran down to the front of the theatre and put the jackets in the most god awful seats imaginable. Front seats and to the far right. Then returned my friend\u2019s coats to their proper places.\n\nMy friends got back pretty quick after that, which was good because I was dreading facing this horrible woman alone. I told them what had happened, and they all laughed - saying had it been THEM that saw it, things would\u2019ve ended differently.\n\nThe the lady comes back and sees that my friends are sitting where she wanted and starts fuming. I point to the front row and tell her, \u201cyour coats are down there.\u201d She storms out. People continue to stream into the theatre.\n\nShe comes back with the manager, points to us, points to the seats she now has and starts loudly complaining. I excuse myself to go listen closer as the lights started to dim for the previews.\n\nThe manager, who had seen us several times while we were in line, stops the lady in the middle of her rant and says something along the lines of \u201cthese guys have been here for hours, if you moved their coats and they moved them back - that\u2019s on you - now take your seat - the movie\u2019s starting.\u201d\n\nShe begrudgingly had to sit in those seats up front because by now, every last seat was taken. \n\nEvery time there was a solar flare or bright flash on the screen I could see that lady in that stupid hat with her kids, staring up at the screen at a ungodly angle. She left as soon as the credits hit and we had a good laugh about it afterwards.",

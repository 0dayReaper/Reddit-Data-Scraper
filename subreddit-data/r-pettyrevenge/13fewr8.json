    "postText": "So, I've been having this annoying problem with my sister lately. She's been eating on my food without even asking me, and it's driving me nuts. I didn't want to confront her about it because I didn't want to start a fight, so I came up with a sneaky plan. \n\nI decided to whip up a batch of scrumptious brownies, knowing my sister has a sweet tooth. I left them on the kitchen counter with a note on the lid that said \"Do Not Eat\". But, of course, my sister couldn't resist and snuck a few. \n\nWhat she didn't know was that I had swapped the sugar for salt. The look on her face when she took a bite was absolutely priceless. She was so confused and grossed out, but I couldn't help but laugh. After that, she never even thought about touching my food again.",

I legit had to do that to my mom who just helped herself to my lunch for work, expensive leftovers, even stuff she swore she hated - she ate it. I started stuffing the fridge with habanero dosed everything. She was pissed. Be mad, it isn't yours so just enjoy your next potty time.",

Just saw they were almonds. She asked if she could have some. Sure. I didn't know she didn't like hit foods and I figured she read the bags. The first bite was hysterical from my POV. Her face was bright red and she puffed out her cheeks because she wanted to put them but had nowhere to so it them. She ran down the hall to get water. Once she came back, I was still laughing. She learned after that to read bags.",

I didn't mind sharing, so people would often grab one if they came in my office. No big deal...except that my favorite non-chocolate candy is Warheads mega sour hard candies. Apparently, not all of my coworkers could handle that level of sour. Lol made for some hilarious reactions.",

All of the extra dust came out with the almonds.  I didn't really think anything of it and went to take my \"drink.\"  I ended up breathing in a bunch of that Wasabi dust.  It was horrible.

The customer had taken a couple bites, and then a busser threw the steak away since the customer obviously got a new one. A few minutes later, I put on gloves and fished it out of the trash, so I could take home for my dogs. \n\nI wrote on the box \u201cDo not eat this!!!\u201d and put it in the fridge when I got home around midnight. A few hours later, I went to the kitchen to get a drink, and I found my drunk brother and his friend chowing down on the steak. I died laughing and told them that, not only had a stranger already eaten bites of it (not really *that* gross), but it was then in a disgusting restaurant trashcan for a couple minutes. They were so disgusted, and it was perfect/totally unintentional revenge!",

All of a sudden someone would eat something out of everyone\u2019s lunch and we couldn\u2019t figure out who it was! One coworker said she was tired of food missing so she said she was going to find out who was eating the food. Next day she comes in and says please don\u2019t touch the eggs in the fridge because she has been waiting to eat them. 2hrs later the night manager came flying down the hallway screaming someone killed baby ducks! Turns out he was the one and when confronted by all of us he hung his head and said he was sorry but he was single and just wanted good food. After that he never touched our food again",

We both worked in restaurants and always brought home food and snacks. We kind of confronted him in a nice way, letting him know it wasn't cool and just to ask, but when he was drunk,  he didn't see to remember. \n\nSo the one day we brewed up suicide sauce for wings at work, people have been asking for something really spicey. So we did and it was insane, it was an all day process to make that sauce, boiling it down, adding more, simmer etc... It was the hottest sauce for wings most of us have ever had, it was insane. So of course we took a small container of it home, and mixed it with something in the fridge, and waited.\n\nSure enough friend came over, rummaged the fridge, found our trap and went to town.  We nearly killed the poor guy, it was the middle of winter, he stepped out side to shove snow in his mouth and just ended up getting sick, while turning red.\n\nIt was wonderfull, hahaah, he never again ate anything out of the fridge.",

    "postText": "This happened years ago. I have a sister 3 years older than me. Me being really shy and soft spoken would never tell our parents of all the constant bullying I received from her. Examples, I'd have to do her chores so she be nice to me. Once had me eat dogfood while our babysitter laughed. Her and said baby sitter once got me grounded because they lied saying I was the one who jumped off counter( we had been warned stop, and I had) and broke a vase my grandmother had pasted to our mother. Because I was crying over the eating dogfood and warned I was telling on them both...so many other examples... But my sister had this pet turtle \" Fred\" she loved and would take him outside to play with her, one such day my mother called her back inside house for something, leaving Fred alone by our swing. I watched her run back inside and I took my chance and thinking helping Fred to freedom thought I'd free him by putting him close to the road so he could go home to his family and away from my evil sister.  Once my sister returned and looked for Fred she became upset calling for him, I had returned inside once I set him free and because I was so quiet and shy she forgotten I was outside when she was called in. She naturally assumed he'd been turtlenapped or gotten lost, for days she looked and cried and I said nothing. Years later as adults we actually had a discussion about wondered what happened to Fred and I confessed to settings him free while my Dad confessed to running him over by accident coming in from work. So basically me putting him close to road I got him killed.  For years I'd asumed he was happy back with his family in his turtle home. Broke my heart.",

I didn\u2019t see the response that said the real people to blame were the parents, so I was confused at your posts. \n\nI was intrigued by your post and wanted to know more about your thoughts and didn\u2019t mean to come across rudely, and \u201cranting\u201d was not the right word for me to use, I apologize. \n\nThanks for taking the time to respond without ripping my head off too. I am a parent who some may consider \u201chelicopter adjacent\u201d\u2026.maybe? I\u2019m not really sure: I do know I\u2019m a lot more involved in things than my own parents were, not that they were bad parents but they were very naive and I was up to a lot of shit very early on in life that I shouldn\u2019t have been, so I take a different approach with my Son that I think my parents sometimes consider too much. But so far my 12 year old isn\u2019t smoking, drinking or taking acid, like I was at 12, so I am cool with being \u201ctoo much\u201d sometimes, in the eyes of my parents.\n\nUgh, it\u2019s been a long day, I hope this all came across ok.

I\u2019m going to assume that OPs older sister didn\u2019t bully OP completely behind the parents backs, and that they were aware that it was happening at least to some degree. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a helicopter parent to sit your kid down and tell them to stop hurting their sibling. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty basic part of parenting.",

    "postText": "Sorry in advance for the long post.\r  \n\r  \nAt my work there is this one lady that is one of the pettiest, rudest people I've ever had to work with. She has been written up and sent to HR multiple times for discrimination and racist remarks such as referring to her (white) self as a \"sl\\*ve driver\" and saying the N\\* word in front of our Black coworkers and has shared personal information about them that is racially charged in nature.\r  \n\r  \nShe's also discriminated against our ethnic housekeepers and tried to get them fired over the smallest thing. She also gossips openly about others to one other woman that is just as toxic as she is.\r  \n\r  \nSo about this chair-it is BROKEN. Legit rickety, loose, and has pitched people onto the floor before and hurt someone's back who has had a spinal fusion.\r  \n\r  \nMaintenance has tried to fix it but it's beyond repair and they suggested we just get rid of it. A group decision was then made to get rid of the chair due to it being a hazard and it was marked for removal and set to go to the dumpster.\r  \n\r  \nThe next morning, this lady shows up and went searching for this broken chair and went all over the building to find it &amp; brings it back. I told her that we were throwing it away because it's broken and it hurt someone's back last night. She said \"no, I need this chair, it's the only one I like\".\r  \n\r  \nI told her that the chair has caused people to fall before and she laughed and said \"that's funny, it doesn't bother me though\".\r  \n\r  \nMy manager told her we can't have broken equipment on the unit if it's a safety risk, and then she proceeded to have another tantrum saying \"I only ask for this one thing, is that too much to ask?!\" and stated that if we wanted to get rid of it that the office has to buy her a special chair just for her. My manager told her that wouldn't happen and for now, she has to lock it up when she's off shift so no one gets hurt.\r  \n\r  \nMind you, we have PLENTY of chairs that are just as or more comfortable, newer, and are more ergonomic than that stupid chair. Her reason for liking it was that it raises up high enough for her desk, which ALL of our other chairs do.\r  \n\r  \nShe doesn't have any known or reported medical issues that would require a BROKEN chair, and she's made it well known that she knows people hate it and that's part of why she likes it.\r  \n\r  \nFollowing some more of her typical behavior towards the rest of the staff in the last few weeks and yet another HR case being opened, I decided to use this week when she's on leave as an opportunity to make sure that thing is finally disposed of. With the help of housekeeping, that thing is now gone forever.\r  \n\r\r  \n\rTLDR; my racist and petty coworker insists we keep a broken chair just for her even though people have been hurt by it and while she's gone for a week I made sure it got thrown away.",

So he asked the cleaners who got in around 6am if they would turn on the lights to his office, which they did. The boss then could not understand how he was getting in so early. So the worker every day would wind his chair down a couple of turns to make it shorter. He did this every day until the chair was at its lowest. He would then wind it up every day and the chair was ridiculously high. Pissed his boss off to no end, but he had no idea who the culprit was and why his chair was not at his set height every day.",

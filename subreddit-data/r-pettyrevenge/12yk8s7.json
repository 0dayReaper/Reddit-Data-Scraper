    "postText": "Saw another teacher revenge story this morning that made me remember mine.\n\nI was in middle school in the early 90s. For context, there will be several things about this story that sound unreal to the younger folks because teachers could literally do just about anything during that era and it was considered normal. Like for instance, we had at least one teacher who would paddle us with a thick board for missing a line while reciting a memorized assignment, or paddle the whole class if she got irritated enough. (Maybe that\u2019s odd, too\u2026Does anyone still have to memorize and recite things?)\n\nThis teacher in this story was honestly pretty good at teaching the material, but he would belittle us when he yelled at us and always took it too far, and he would throw things at us (pens, chalk, whatever small object was handy). I hated his class because middle school is where you are really starting to learn who you are going to be as a person, and I was growing into the kind of person who was not going to take any more verbal abuse from adults or anyone else.\n\nOn this particular day, someone had brought a ball of modeling clay into the room, probably from art class, and this teacher yelled at them and took it away from them. Then for the rest of the class he griped and bitched and every time he found someone lacking, he threw a hunk of clay at them. Now, I was usually a pretty good, quiet kid, not someone people suspect, but as I sat there staring out the window and seething about him treating us this way, an evil idea struck me and I just broke. I started down-low signaling everyone to pass me the wads of clay he threw at them, and they did because they could tell something was up and there\u2019s nothing a middle schooler loves more than mischief. By the end of class, I had collected all of it without the teaching knowing.\n\nLater that day they sent us out to recess like always. Now I realize most of this paragraph is going to be \u201cyou-just-have-to-believe-me-because-it-was-the-early-90s\u201d, but the line of teacher parking spaces ran down one side of the outdoor playground area with no fence. This guy always parked right where the swing set ended and kids milled around waiting for their turn, kicking rocks and picking clover or whatever, and it was easy to blend in, not be seen and not look suspicious. I took that clay from my pocket a few bits at a time and put ALL OF IT underneath his windshield wipers. \n\nAnd why did I do this, oh reader? Because what I saw when I was staring out the window during class that inspired my idea was a major storm rolling in. The air was heavy and humid, the sky was a funny color, the clouds were low, and you could just feel it coming. My luck held, and when they sent us out to recess that day, the first heavy drops were just starting to fall. (Yes, as I told you, it was the 90s\u2014the \u201cI-don\u2019t-want-to-hear-it-JUST-GO-OUTSIDE\u201d 90s.) And that\u2019s another reason nobody saw me do it. Everybody had coats with hoods up and the teachers on duty were huddled under the awning complaining and trying to keep their cigarettes dry (you get that it was the early 90s by now, right?).\n\nFor the last hour of the school day it rained buckets, like a tropical monsoon or something. And I sat there through my last class grinning like a cat, knowing that when this guy ran through that rain after work and hopped in his car wet and cold and tried to turn on his wipers, at best they\u2019d be stuck and wouldn\u2019t move, and at worst that clay would have melted some and would smear all over the place. Either way he\u2019d have to get out in the pouring rain and deal with it.\n\nBest part? Never got caught. Only a few people that were nearby even saw me do it and they were on board. Dude actually never said a word the next day, trying to act unaffected and not give whoever did it the satisfaction (it didn\u2019t work, he was obviously seething), just watched us like a hawk trying to see who was going to break and act guilty. I think we probably got a small generic lecture on ethics. I have to give it to him, I thought he\u2019d come in raging like a banshee and have the principal in to threaten us. But no, he just took his lumps. But know this: he never threw another object at anyone in our class again, and for all I know maybe he learned his lesson and never threw objects at any other class ever again.",

She threw it at a couple of kids, and then thought it would be a great idea to use in grammar drills (she taught a foreign language). She'd announce a verb, then say the pronoun for whichever \"person\" of speech she wanted the answer to, throw the hackey sack, and if she threw it at you, you'd have to conjugate the verb correctly as you caught it. She'd pull that out on days when we were sluggish. (She might have had to do that every morning after a World Series game the year when the local team made it to the series.)",

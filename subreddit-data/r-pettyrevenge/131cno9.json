    "postText": "My (often times charmingly immature) husband is an engineer who has had the privilege of travelling to many places around the world to work. I've had the opportunity to join him on some of these trips, and while we've had many wonderful experiences, there are a few destinations he never liked travelling to. One such destination is where my husband had an unpleasant encounter that led to an act of petty revenge.\n\nDuring one of his stays in the capital city of this particular country, my husband was riding the elevator down to the hotel restaurant when a local man got in a few floors below him, smoking a cigar. My husband politely asked the man if he could refrain from smoking in such a confined space, to which the man replied with hostility, asserting his right to do as he pleased in his own country.\n\nDespite the man's rude behaviour, my husband remained calm and avoided escalating the situation. A few days later, he found himself in the elevator with the same man, who thankfully wasn't smoking this time. As the elevator descended, my husband reached past the man and pressed a button for a floor just a few floors below the floor on which the man had boarded the elevator. When the doors opened, my husband made his exit and, as the doors closed behind him, he let out a loud and unpleasant fart, leaving the man to stew in the foul odour.\n\nRevenge smelled like boiled cabbage, apparently.",

            "comment": "A little known \"fact\" is that us engineers are taught to fart on command as part of the degree. \nI believe the masters degree teaches one how to fart several different odours on command. \nFurther, I understand a PhD in engineering allows one to vary the hydrogen/methane ratio on demand for such eventualities as competitions, including those involving the ignition of such gaseous emissions.\n\nOf course, we're one to study politics, the training uses the mouth for the same function.\n/s",

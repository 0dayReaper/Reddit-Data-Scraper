    "postText": "I was on holidays in an all inclusive resort. First day, we couldn\u2019t find any lounge chairs by the beach or by the sea, fair enough - we arrived in the afternoon. Next day, we go to find a spot.. but most of the spots were \u2018taken\u2019 by towels. We find an empty seat and to our surprise - many of the chairs stay reserved almost the whole day or never get used.. \n\nThird day, we decide to take some towels off two loungers, and enjoy our day. Four (!!) hours in, an older couple shows up that they had towels there, and kick us off with help from an attendant. \n\nThat pissed me off, so every following day I went to take the towels off of every unattended lounger after breakfast, and then went to watch the chaos from my balcony. Many many people complained and by the end of the week there was a sign that unattended towels would be removed. Success!",

That's the window before the chairs are free game.\n\nTotally got into a pissing match with an old couple because we moved vacant loungers into an open space next to them.\n\n\"They were going to use it later.\"\n\n They weren't even saving chairs. They were trying to save open space. \n\nWe didn't move.",

British citizens were some of the first to obtain enough riches to travel en masse (the legacy of slavery, colonialism and imperialism) and have since been educated on international travel norms via government and industry education. \n\nMany countries have now revised their xenophobic/racist immigration laws and are only recently allowing less-but-still-very-rich Chinese tourists to visit, and to do so independently for the first time, and so you have a hugely massive population that's learning to travel for the first time.\n(Indian tourists have a leg up in the tourist game due to British colonialism and immigration but there are similar factors at play.)\n\nAs someone else pointed out, the signs are for people who use squat toilets and don't know how to use a western toilet, and also includes the tidbit about how toilet paper in that country is intended for flushing rather than being placed in a trash can.",

We had waited 20 minutes before we moved their towels and this still showed up, close to an hour *AFTER* to say \"our towels were there!\" \n\nI cut them off, and told them it's more than a half an hour since we've sat down. They didn't want to hear it so Karen got the hotel manager. 5 minutes later she yelled something to her husband, he walked off and the manager came out to us, explaining the pool attendant is supposed to remove towels off of unoccupied benches after 10 minutes anyway. He think, based on their attitude , that they had chased off the pool attendant.",

They were pretty angry and began to harass people in line long enough for the police to show up and write them a ticket for parking in a fire lane.",

            "comment": "I had a similar experience many years ago in Puerto Vallarta.  I was on my balcony having coffee and watching the choice morning lounges, those facing east.  Only two were occupied when I first looked over the next hour I kept checking, more lounges were filling up, but there were several that had towels that never moved.  After another half hour I was ready to go done to the pool. I checked from my balcony one last time and found two together that had nothing but towels on them since I started checking.\n\nI went down and made a beeline for those two lounges.  I asked the people on either side if they were saving them for someone.  Both told me that they didn't know anything about who put the towels there and that no one had been using them all morning.\n\nI removed the towel from one of the lounges and an irate little woman came charging out of the outdoor cafe, where she was eating LUNCH.  She was mad as hell and a staff member came over to calm her down.  She told him she and her husband had reserved the chairs hours ago and they have been using them all morning.  I told him I had been watching from my balcony all morning and the only thing on the chairs were towels.  All the guests nearby corroborated this.  I also pointed out that the woman was currently eating lunch in the cafe.  The Staff member asked her if that was true, and she sheepishly admitted she was eating lunch in the cafe when I \"stole\" her chair.\n\nAt this point everyone was annoyed by the ruckus she was making, the staff member included.  He told the woman there was no resort policy about reserving pool lounges and that a lounge chair with a towel on it, but no person was open for any guest to use.  The crazy lady went off to finish her lunch, grumbling all the way.  I thanked the staff member for stepping in and settled into the lounge chair.  Before leaving the pool area the staff member walked all the way around the pool and removed every white towel sitting on an unused chair and stuffed them in the hamper to be washed.\n\nAt least for the rest of my stay, the practice of reserving lounge chairs with towels stopped.",

We saw one annoying couple complaining to the staff and gesturing at us from a distance, but no one confronted us. People are ridiculous. (I also think the resort purposely puts a limited number of loungers out to encourage you to pay top dollar for cabanas and stuff, which is a separate gripe.

The hotel did the lounge chair assignments every morning - two per room, and they rotated the \u2018best\u2019 spots. No reserving them with towels, you literally had to go to the concierge desk and ask which two chairs were yours for the day. You might end up on the beach, or right next to the pool, or squished in next to a rock or the toilets. But you can\u2019t complain because you\u2019ll have different chairs tomorrow. Such a good policy!",

At 4am, a group of people decided to each take a sunbed off the stack, drop it onto the tiled surface, and then lift one end and draggged the sunbeds to the other side of the pool, before dropping the end back down.\n\nThey did this whilst talking very loudly (Europeans) and then proceeded to place their towels on them.\n\nThe din that they made woke up our toddler.\n\nWhilst my partner tended to our child, I slipped down to the pool, folded their towels neatly in a pile, and then threw them all into the deep end of the pool.\n\nCome the next morning they wandered down to the pool to find that the pool attendant had dragged their towels out and spread them out over the nearby bushes to dry, but they were still pretty sodden. \n\nThey didn't do that again.",

There\u2019s parades and fireworks and lots to do. \n\nI used to live a block from Main Street, where the parade would be coming by. People would set out lawn chairs on the sidewalks days beforehand. The morning of, I would get a couple lawn chairs and go sit to wait (I wouldn\u2019t move any currently placed ones). I\u2019d be with my lawn chairs the whole time. From 10am till the parade started. I\u2019d read a book or watch the little bit of traffic go by.\n\nThere\u2019s be people trying to push me over to get their lawn chairs in the line of lawn chairs. I wouldn\u2019t move. \n\nThen people would try to stand in front of me, but you\u2019re not allowed to stand in the road while the parade is going on. Plus I\u2019d yell at them to move. My brother would come over in his wheelchair and grown adults would stand in front of him! They didn\u2019t care. Fucking assholes. He can\u2019t really yell either because he\u2019s paralyzed from the nipples down and can\u2019t control his diaphragm to yell. \n\nIt annoys me the amount of people who don\u2019t know basic societal rules.",

One of the reasons I've stopped trying to go anywhere tropical is because I don't want to fight the selfish glass bowls who think taking three or more umbrellas when no one in their 4 person family is actually sitting/lounging there is an okay idea. I get that too much sun is a concern for all, and my condition is my problem, but when every family snaps up multiple things and umbrellas it makes it impossible for others to be there. Overlapping areas of shade aren't actually required for pool/beach enjoyment. (Unfortunately none of the places I've been had cabanas for rent, I would have absolutely done it.)\n\nI guess the answer lies in tipping the staff excessively for help getting *an* umbrella.",

    "postText": "I live in a major city. My neighbor, a young Sneakerhead and occasional Hype Beast, has been rude to others, including my wife. \n\nIrritated, I found a way to respond. Since we usually speak my wife's native language, he assumed she couldn't understand English. \n\nIn the elevator, he made unkind comments. Learning he resells sneakers, I took action. \n\nI kept track of his social media and ordered popular replica sneakers. I donated them to a nearby school with fewer resources. As the less fortunate kids proudly wore them, the wealthy ones lost interest. \n\nIt has hurt his business, as I have been doing this for the last eighteen months and around 100 pairs.",

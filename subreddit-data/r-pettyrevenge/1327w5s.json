    "postText": "I was working at a bartender at a stripclub about 8 years ago, the only stripclub in my region. Busy night as always, made a few backdrafts, poured some shots all was going well. Then I look up &amp; see some girls laughing &amp; pointing. I recognized one instantly as a bully from my home town, they were in my place of work making me anxious &amp; uncomfortable so I told the bouncers to remove them, he did no questions asked. The one girl refused to leave and then her sister made a scene, tried to fight me from in front of the bar &amp; the lot of them got kicked out &amp; their boyfriends too who were too busy watching the strippers in the dance room &amp; missed the whole thing\ud83d\ude02 then they all got banned from the rest of the clubs around town for 2 years for being entitled losers. Should of just left me the hell alone Jessie \ud83d\ude02",

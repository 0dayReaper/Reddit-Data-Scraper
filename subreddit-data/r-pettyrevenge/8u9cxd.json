    "postText": "This may be the pettiest thing I have ever done.\n\nSo in my city there is a pub that's attached to a doughnut shop that serves the best doughnuts in the city (which always causes a long line). Because its attached to a pub, it doesn't close shop until 9PM as there is a solid flow of business rolling in. \n\nAnyway, my girlfriend and I get a serious hankering for some snacks so we decide to head to the doughnut shop and arrive out around 8:30 P:M by car. Now, there are only three parallel parking spots a little up the street from the place, and they are all 15-minute spots which are usually full.  We see up the street that, count our lucky stars, a spot is free! My girlfriend pulls a little ahead of the car in front of the spot, turns on her indicator, and begins backing into parking spot when this little white vespa driving behind us whips into the spot. I roll down our window and call out to the driver \"Scuse me, we were just backing in\". The driver seems to be a pretty univ student who shrugs her shoulders and calls out to me \"sorry, first come first serve!\" while her and her friend share a good laugh. \n\nMy girlfriend suggests we just get doughnuts another time, and I tell her she can drop me off here, Ill buy the doughnuts since I know what she likes, and she can loop around. She agrees, and I pop out of the car, pass the little white vespa where the girls are still gathering their things, and head to the shop. As always, the line is super long for doughnuts and since this is the last batch, the doughnuts are slim pickins. The girls are behind me looking at the 5 or so different flavors that are left, talking about which ones are best and which they havent had yet. I hear one of them jokingly mention \"thank god we got a parking spot\" and they burst out laughing. I get to the front of the line, and when asked for my order, request two dozen doughnuts, which is every last one remaining. The girls behind me didnt listen to what I ordered, but eyebrows of confusion started to form on their faces and they slowly saw each doughnut loaded into the boxes and their options dwindle. \n\nOne of them (the driver) in desperation asked the baker who was loading them in \"what, youre not even gonna save a few for us though?\" to which I turned around and said \"sorry, first come first serve\".  She honestly looked like she just simultaneously solved a movie mystery and shit her pants, its difficult to put into words but truly an expression I can never forget.   \n\n\nBest doughnuts I ever tasted (and enjoyed by the rest of my office the next morning)",

For whatever reason they always seem to be the people that take the longest to actually get ready and out of their car. Why re they in such a rush for the prime spots if they are only going to sit there and waste time. ",

At the auto parts store in my hometown, I was backing out of a parking space and accidentally backed into another car parked along the curb in front of the store. Damn, my fault, or so I assumed. Once the police arrived, however, it was determined to be the other car's fault as they had parked against the curb which technically was not a legal parking spot and therefore the car shouldn't have been there in the first place. I could have rammed the car on purpose and it would have still been their fault. \n\nThe reason for this became immediately apparent to me. If someone parks along the curb, there isn't enough room for a legally parked vehicle to back out of their spot. Even though I technically should have seen the car when I was backing up, I'll take what I can get. ",

The way our store was set up, there was only one tiny ramp up the curb to the front of the store, so I had to bring all the carts up that. We used to have people park next to the curb all the time, occasionally blocking the ramp. Any time it would happen and I couldn't get the large line of carts I'd built up up the ramp and into the store, I'd have to leave them in the middle of the lot, which usually meant blocking the main path by the front of the store, which included the way to one of the main exits. There would be a giant line of cars backed up when the dumbass who left there car there came out of the store getting yelled at by everyone for blocking the ramp.\n\nThe best time was when someone did it and the ambulance came due to some old person falling and the car got towed.",

The lady in the spot finally pulls out, and turns towards me so I cant pull into it quickly, and the bitch pulled into it.  I could see her laughing as she did so.  Fuck it, I'll find another spot and finally did so.\n\nA few minutes later I'm in my store and get called to the return desk for a customer complaint.  A lady was pissed we wouldn't do a return for an item without a receipt.  There's a limit of three in six months, and she was past it, and wanted a manager to make an exception.  I get to the desk and lo and behold guess who it was?  Parking spot thief!  I put on my best retail smile and politely told her not only no, but fuck no.  When she started to raise hell I told her to leave or be banned from the store.  She skulked out.  My desk associates told me she was notorious for being a return-a-holic, and that LP was already investigating her for fraud.  ",

            "comment": "2 yrs ago, my roommate and I upgraded to a bigger apartment in the same complex we'd lived in for a year. We rented a small moving truck, packed it, went to the other side of the complex. Parking sucks here (there's a row in front of the building, and then 4 spots facing the other direction directly across), but there happened to be a decent spot in front of the building. I tried backing the truck into the spot and my roommate was guiding me in. I didn't turn properly the first time and I couldn't make it in the spot, so my roommate very loudly instructs me to pull forward and try it again. As he's doing this, a guy pulls up and stops. I thought he was waiting for me to get out of the way. His windows were down and he was looking out at us, so he obviously knew what was happening. \n\nI pulled out of the spot and as soon as I did, he zooms into the spot, almost hitting my roommate. He then immediately put his phone against his ear pretending to be on the phone and got out, purposely avoiding eye contact with me and my roommate that was yelling at him. He speed-walked into his apartment. We parked the truck by a curb and moved our stuff in from there, which was walking our furniture the long way around the cars. \n\nI don't personally believe what goes around always comes around, but for this guy it did. We took a water break after a while then went outside to finish unloading. When we walked out we heard someone screaming angrily. Turns out it was the guy that stole our spot. Someone in one of the opposite-facing spots backed into his car. ",

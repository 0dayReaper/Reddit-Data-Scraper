    "postText": "My freshman year I had the most inconsiderate roommate who'd stay up all night talking loudly, eat my food, etc.\n\nOddly, my washcloths that I used to wash my face would go missing. Like, I think I lost like 3 or 4 throughout the semester. I thought someone was taking them but I had no idea where to.\n\nWell, the end of the semester we were clearing out the bathroom cabinets to move out, and what did I find shoved in the far back corners of the cabinet? MY WASHCLOTHS. Which were COVERED in orange foundation. (Clearly evidence from my one rude roommate because she wore so much foundation every single day). \n\nI was super annoyed because I had to keep buying more washcloths to replace the ones she stole. \n\nWell, I decided to use one of my other washcloths and clean the DISGUSTING bathtub with it. I'm talking ring of shampoo, dirt, hair everywhere, etc. I was planning to just throw it away afterwards, but I decided to hang it up and let it dry.... in the same place I would hang my washcloths for my face. \n\nThe next day the washcloth I had used for the bathtub was covered in orange foundation.... the look on her face when I told her...\n\nNo regrets.",

We used old an old toothbrush at one point. \n\nMy grandfather was a real joker, so as a joke we put the toothbrush on the sink where his toothbrush would have been, and put his back in his bag.\n\nNext morning, mom checked the cleaning toothbrush, and it was wet on the sink as if it had just been used, his other brush was in his bag.\n\nHe was a hypochondriac so no one wanted to ask him about it in case he didn't know, so he wouldn't start worrying about being sick. But he was a joker, so maybe he fooled us? He took that answer to his grave, lol.",

    "postText": "Backstory, I 30 female got married 6 years ago then 24 to my high-school sweetheart M29 then 23. I invited my whole family. My uncle and his two kids where among the invited. HIS DAUGHTER then 16 was one of my bridesmaids. The day of my wedding 6 years ago, he dropped my cousin off to the church with us girls to get ready at 8am . For pictures noon and wedding at 230.\r  \n\r  \nMy uncle handed me a coffee, my favorite, and told me that he would not be back in time for pictures or the wedding or reception. Because he has going fishing and taking my almost 16 year old male cousin with him. So he can breath in the breathalyzer when he's to drunk to start the car. That was 6 years ago. Mind you, even the uncle I hated and didn't want to be there managed to shower, get dressed nice, go 3 days with out using drugs to be sober and not smell of meth and managed to post bail a week before my wedding to be there. But one of my 2 favorite uncles wasn't coming to go fishing. \ud83d\ude15\r  \n\r  \nFew months back, I received an RSVP to my uncles wedding. He's marrying a friend of my mom's. Glad he's happy. Haven't talked to him in 6 years since he didn't come to the wedding. Well, I mailed back the RSVP with \"GOING FISHING\" on the will not be attending line. (I hate fishing. But I'll at least kayak most the time)\r  \n\r  \nMy uncle and his soon to be bride contacted my parents. To try to talk me into changing my mind. And to attend. To which I told him we haven't talked in 6 years. That I would be fishing. And that if he wanted me there maybe he should have thought about my wedding 6 years ago. His answer was he brought me coffee and mt 16 year old cousin who was a bridesmaid.\r  \nSo I sent him the reservation that I will be kayaking and fishing during his wedding.\n\n\nUPDATE/ EDIT: My uncle who made bail, got clean and attended, is still struggling with drugs. We know he cares. He still manages to clean up for when it matters. My sister's graduation, his son's graduation, My grandparent's funerals and my cousin's funeral. He cares and we know he does, but unfortunately, meth is a hell of a drug and makes him do things that are less than favorable too.  We still care for him, but we have to keep him at arms length for saftey.\n\nAs for my Uncle, I finally got an apology. He said he didn't attend 6 years ago due to his alcoholism, and even though the reception was the only place with alcohol he knew he would be better off fishing and drinking there, than at the church and reception hall drinking. He is living his best life and is still partying and drinking. I still am not attending his wedding. The wedding is in July, We are scheduled for brunch after they return from Hawaii. I am sending them a gift. Though i will also doordash a coffee to the church lol. Now it will be more of a joke, than the fact he didn't show to my wedding. My dad is one of 6 children all boys.\n\nEdit 2: my family history of drug and alcoholism actually help me go to college and become a therapist in addiction counseling. ALONG WITH  2 other Master degrees. Even though my father and mother didn't follow some if his brothers paths. And my father being 1 of 6 brothers meant I was 1 of 32 grandkids. I seen a lot of addiction. Sadly.",

    "postText": "This is about 14 year ago. When I had just graduated high school I was able to get a summer job out in western Massachusetts, far from home and incredibly rural. 45 min to the closest Walmart and you had to drive over a mountain to get there if I recall correctly. The job itself wasn't really involved in the story so I won't really go into details there other than sometimes I had to drive my personal vehicle to the sites we were working on.\n\nThe day my cousin and I showed up we met four coworkers. Two were in their thirties and generally pretty easy to work with. The other two were twenty something's still in college and still partying like it. We can call them Thing 1 and Thing 2. This job was four ten hours days staying out in this cheap motel all week so there was a lot of downtime and we had to get creative to entertain ourselves sometimes. One night we all decided to do the gallon challenge, which involved drinking a gallon of milk in a single hour without puking. I made it the longest to just north of 50ish minutes. I can't remember exactly but I know I lasted the longest without throwing up and there wasn't much milk left in the gallon jug.\n\nSome additional important information. The second week out there, I found a snake and two lizards in my car and Thing 1 and Thing 2 thought this was hilarious. Now I've been bullied a lot my whole life. I was generally good natured, easy going and honest. For whatever reason this usually made me a target, and I grew up learning how to handle bullies. I wasn't a big kid so I usually had to use the 'Hey Arnold' approach and act too crazy or unpredictable to mess with. I knew this small prank could lead to a miserable summer of constant harassment that I didn't need or want. So my response was something I was internally brainstorming, until the night of the gallon challenge I had a stroke of genius.\n\nSomeone made me laugh as the 50 minute mark passed and I immediately felt my stomach turn. I've got nearly a gallon of milk in my stomach and it is about to be violently evicted. Suddenly I had an idea as I was standing outside the motel room in the parking lot, about to vomit into the storm drain. At the last second, I turned and blasted a fire hose of half digested milk across Thing 1's parents car. It was his turn to drive this week as Thing 2 had driven last week, and he had parked right outside our rooms obviously. I puked on the front of his car, down the side and across the trunk when he finally came out to see what was going on. I was still puking when I full on sprinted away as he hurled a fuller milk jug at me and then chased me across the parking lot. I wasn't messed with ever again and it was a much better summer. The parking lot smelled absolutely horrendous the next morning though but luckily we were the only people staying there that week.",

Then it was summer holiday season so we decided to move after that.\n\nThe offices smelt funny but they couldn't figure out where it was coming from so the lowest ranking (me) was sent in to investigate.\n\nOne of the decorators had left an open milk carton in the last office they did, sat in a closed up room with big windows right through the hottest part of summer.\n\nI pinched the top shut and carried it out, retching all the way. Then I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life and slung it hard and fast into a skip, where it burst open spectacularly.\n\nIt was another week before anyone wanted to go near that area...",

The evaporation kept the milk cold and all was good. \n\nThen we forgot about it because my room mate moved out. Weeks go by and the milk has gone thoroughly bad, so bad I didn't want to move it. So I did what any idiot 18yr old does and ignored the problem. \n\nIn June it was time to move out and I had to do something... So I cut the bag loose and watched it drop 6 stories into the flat roof below. It didn't 'splash' as you'd expect it just popped down and hardly moved.  I left (ran away) that morning so don't know if the hall bar smelt funny as a result of the bio hazard that has just landed on the roof, and I wasn't about to find out :)",

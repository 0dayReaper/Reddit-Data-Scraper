    "postText": "*tl;dr - Constant slamming doors in adjacent apartment woke up my sleeping GF. She found out it was used as an Airbnb with 4 total Airbnb listings in our small apartment complex and reported them to leasing office and they likely lost thousands of dollars and were evicted/moved out.*\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that his LinkedIn account shows he enrolled and completed courses through Tai \"here in my garage\" Lopez' online program haha\n\nEdit 2: A lot of butthurt people in the comments and DMs. Stay mad\n\nWe live in a new and small apartment complex, only 40 units within 2 buildings. It's very low-key and within walking distance to our downtown. It's very affordable for how convenient a location it is.\n\nBack in September we noticed the vacant unit beside us was getting moved into by a new tenant with furniture, decor, etc. One weekend not long after moving in we heard what sounded like a little party with music and loud voices well past midnight. We heard a lot of people coming in and out of the front door, but letting the door slam each time to where it shook the walls. Maybe they were having a house warming party or a friend's get together at the new place. So we brushed it under the rug as a one-off incident.\n\nFor the next few weeks we noticed a variety of people coming in and out of this apartment and none of them seemed to be the same individuals. Parking also started to become much more busy than usual as well as the cars kept changing. So, something seemed off.\n\nMy GF started working night shift for her job not long after the neighboring apartment became occupied. She is a light sleeper and noticed that all throughout the morning and before going to work the neighbor's door was always slamming and shaking the walls. She understands that people are active in the day and she can't ask people to cater to her night shift needs, but she felt the constant slamming of doors was not only disruptive, but unusual behavior. \n\nOne particular morning was the straw that broke the camel's back. She had finally had enough because of the effect it was having on her sleep. She wanted to see who was slamming the door. She heard the door slamming around 1030 am and got up and witnessed people walking to their car with suitcases and leaving. Soon after a man arrived and pulled up the front doormat and retrieved a key and let two women with cleaning supplies into the apartment. Each time they entered or left the door would *SLAM* and shake the wall.  \n\nSeeing this she searched Airbnb and almost immediately found the rental unit next door. Same floor plans, wall paint, flooring, etc. To our surprise and anger we found a total of *FOUR* listings in our apartment complex alone on the host's profile. That is 10% of the apartments in our buildings. \n\nThrough the listings we found the individual's LinkedIn and business website. On his website he claims that he does something called \"retal arbitrage\". Essentially this is renting out a long term rental on short term basis (lease an apartment and rent it on Airbnb for profit). This can be done legally with the landlord's permission. The lease agreement does not allow for sub-lettng or short term rentals. \n\nThey were renting out 3 of the 4 ground end units offered (units with unique floorplans). The 4th unit was a handicap accessible unit. That's right. This man and his business partner leased an apartment meant for accommodating people with disabilities with the intention of using it for his little short term business empire he was trying to build. Our city and region (like in other places) has been feeling the squeeze on apartment availability and these dickheads are contributing to the problem. \n\nIt was at this point we took this personally as we had our own problems dealing with apartment availability, wait-lists, disappointment, and frustration. My GF called the leasing office and notified them that the neighboring unit is being rented out on Airbnb and asked if that was allowed to which the office gave an emphatic \"absolutely not\" and asked for the listings to be sent to them in an email. Later that day the office called her back and said they notified the \"tenant\" that they will be inspecting the apartments the following afternoon. \n\nAfter the inspection was completed the office notified that they had sent a cease and desist docent of any rental activities outside the lease agreement or face eviction. They also informed us that \"you should not have anymore problems concerning the matter and if you do, don't hesitate to give us a call :)\".\n\nNow, this asshole has four leases he is stuck paying $1500/month for and can't make anymore money on through Airbnb. He is bleeding money at the tune of about $6000/month. His only legal options are to continue paying for them or to break the leases and vacate. Last week we watched as movers emptied out the apartments. I'm sure they lost deposits and/or were penalized for breaking the leases. A very expensive lesson for being greedy \"entrepreneur\".\n\nDon't be dickheads, folks. Also, don't piss off a night shifter trying to sleep.",

Statcan says that 20% of urban ontario properties are not owner-occupied (so probably rentals, vacant, or second home). It also notes that those are growing at the twice the rate of owner-occupied housing. They noted in all Ontario almost half of all condos were not owner-occupied. \n\nMeanwhile, they noted that the share of residential properties owned by non-canadians (which they confusingly refer to as \"non-residents\") was just 2.2% in Ontario.\n\nSo that means for every one investment property owned by a non-Canadian, there are another 9 owned by domestic investors. But non-canadians aren't voters, so they're an easy scapegoat for the government.\n\n[Source](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/210917/dq210917b-eng.htm)\n\nEdit: and it's even worse in my midsize town. The city of Waterloo has 2.2% of properties owned by non-residents (\"foreigners\"). But only 75% of properties are owner occupied. And its poised to get much worse.... Out of all properties built since 2016, only 35% are owner occupied. And when you look at entry-level properties (row homes, semis, and condos (which are big in Waterloo)) it gets even worse! Of all the new housing they've added since 2016, only:\n\n* 30/55 semis are owner-occupied (55%) \n\n* 80/260 row homes are owner-occupied (54%)\n\n* and just 360/2,430 condos are owner-occupied (15%)\n\n[Source: Statcan](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=4610005401)\n\nHomeownership is increasingly a fantasy for the Ontario middle-class, and its not because of foreigners. Of people who owned property individually, more than one in seven owned multiple.

I'm also originally from South Florida, where real estate is the top industry, and while it often moves vastly different from national trends due to extremely wealthy foreign buyers, the rises and falls are obvious and I know what to look out for. \n\nWhile my projections on stuff like this are almost consistently right (if I had had capital enough to invest in real estate a decade ago, I'd be up, but so Life goes), I only share my thoughts to convince others to think twice about their decisions and do a lot more research than one might normally.\n\nEdit: I also \"predicted\" this crash to begin at pretty much exactly this point and tried to comfort all my friends and fam despondent over not affording to buy a home that they'd be able to within 3-5 years from 2020.",

Furious to be in that situation, furious that the host asked me to lie for her benefit, furious that she was part of the problem, of people fucking over locals and messing up the housing market. \n\nI reported the listing to Airbnb, left an honest review of the host, and gave the apartment complex as much information as I was comfortable sharing.",

Get the fuck out\u201d. \n\nThe worst part was definitely the parties though. Dunk assholes blasting music, slamming doors, and yelling/screaming until 4AM or later. It would often spill out into the hallways or communal spaces, so there would be a crowd of people literally right in front of the door to my unit. It wasn\u2019t their home so they would give zero fucks about the tenants who actually lived there who they would never have to see again - if you asked them to keep it down they\u2019d usually laugh in your face and talk shit, sometimes they\u2019d get belligerent and aggressive. For some reason this shit would usually be happening on a weeknight when I had work the next day, so I would *maybe* get an hour or two of sleep and it was putting a huge strain on my ability to perform and costing my professional reputation. \n\nThe apartment manager refused to do anything about it at first - apparently they were running the Airbnb - but thankfully the building changed ownership eventually and the new owner shut it down.",

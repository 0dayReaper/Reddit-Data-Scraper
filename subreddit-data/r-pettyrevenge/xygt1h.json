    "postText": "This was a few years ago on a 13 hour Greyhound trip when I was in the middle of a mental breakdown. These people were listening to music loudly, and if that wasn't bad enough it was just awful. It was the kind of rap where the only words you can understand are b**ch and n****r, and they were said frequently.\n \nIt was driving me nuts, so I tried politely asking them to use headphones. They refused because they had kids based on the claim the kids needed entertained. So I told them to give the kids headphones. This led to me getting cussed out, which led to a heated argument. Another passenger started listening to music loudly just to troll me at this point. I tried to get the bus driver to enforce the rule that says headphones are required to listen to music on the bus. He threatened to dump me on the side of the road instead.\n \nI kind of hit my limit at that point and decided to share my misery with the whole bus. I said, \"Ok. Since we're not enforcing the rules about not being noisy and using headphones, I'll just sing.\" Now, it should be noted that while I don't have the best voice I am a trained vocalist from childhood. I can at least avoid sounding like a strangled cat... If I want to. I didn't want to. I launched into a very loud, hoarse, and off key rendition of The Song That Never Ends. It took one sing through for the troll to put headphones in. It took a couple loops before the whole bus was screaming at the other passengers to either put in headphones or turn off their music so that I would shut up. We rode the rest of the way in blissful silence.",

If they can cohesively understand the lyrics being sung, you're too loud and will be told to shut the fuck up by the designated \"bbq dad\" of the group.\n\nOur park is kind of an L shape following the river, and everyone kind of decided the shallow part of the river and the nearby grass is where families sit, teens and young adults go to the other end and just bring a towel down to the river if they want to swim. After about 7pm its fair game tho.\n\nIts so odd that we've all just kind of created these rules out of common courtesy. Its quite lovely really.",

My favorite is Three Blind Mice, I used this on three particularly annoying Project Managers who always seemed to be together when coming to bitch about whatever was their pet peeve of the day.  I enlisted a few other Tradies who helped out so no matter where on the job they went they heard this\u2026..for about three weeks until the junior PM came to us literally with his hard hat in hand begging us to stop. First they started humming it to themselves in their office, that progressed to the commute and finally to their homes where their SO s were threatening eviction if they kept singing that damn song.  Needless to say their on site visits slowed a bit but we just switched just  to Mary Had a Little Lamb\u2026\u2026",

Every once in awhile I\u2019d get someone who either didn\u2019t care or lacked any social awareness and it would just be 30+ minutes of barely understandable battling sounds. So eventually I made the most annoyingly random playlist of songs I could find and bought the loudest portable Bluetooth speaker I could find (who cares about audio quality in these situations?) since I travel to different locations and work with different people I rarely see the same people more than a few weeks a year if ever again i just keep the speaker in my work bag. Anytime we are on break and someone wants to share there choice in music with everyone I normally ask something to the effect of \u201cdoesn\u2019t it get annoying if everyone is just playing their own music all the time?\u201d  If they say no or nobody cares. Then I pull out my speaker and all of a sudden people do seem to care, or well they just leave the breakroom anyway.\n\nTo be fair most do get the point when I ask and offer to wear headphones or \u201cturn it down\u201d if it bothers me so the speaker rarely gets used. Not gonna lie though you\u2019d think it would be mostly younger people but the most hard headed and annoying are the 60+ crowd listening to news updates. I\u2019m at work bro I\u2019m already depressed I don\u2019t want to listen to how bad the fucking economy is doing on my damn lunch break.",

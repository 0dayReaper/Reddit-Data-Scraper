    "postText": "About a year and a half ago, my mom was married and had filed for divorce from an abusive, narcissistic a-hole. I was helping her move out. The least violent, inconvenient, annoying thing I could think of to do to this man was to unpair all of the socks in his drawer and unfold a new of his clothes in drawers. \nAs we were leaving I heard rustling in an air vent. I took the vent cover off and found a wedge of onion in the vent. My mom was suffering substantially from Covid with parosmia where onion made her nauseated and literally throw up. I then took all vent covers off and found more onion wedges in 2 other vents, totaling 3. I then took his postit notes and wrote \u2018f-you\u2019 \u2018f-you\u2019 and \u2018sick bastard\u2019 and put those in the air vents so that when he moved in and went to remove the onion he knew he put there, he would find my notes. And that cocksucker would know that I knew what he did.",

We were taking it out of the tank and it\u2019s liquified remains were dripping out of its house while we moved it (within a second) from the tank into a trash bag. \n\nThe smell was unbelievable, despite tying the bag immediately. Double-bagging didn\u2019t help either so I ran to the elevator and held the bag as far away from myself as possible (and pinched my nose shut with my other hand) during the ride down, before I dropped it in the large trash containers outside.\n\nColleague never bought another snail after that. \ud83d\ude05",

Every room has a electrical socket which is easily unscrewable and therefore can easily hold the most smelly of all disgusting food items you can imagine, fish, cheese etc, a little of each in all rooms can cause all sorts of reactions, is it a fishy smell or is it a cheesy smell, who knows ? Either way it is rank. Good luck with whatever you do in  getting revenge and i may add satisfaction knowing that whoever smells the unthinkable will never be able to decide if its fishy or cheesy!",

    "postText": "I (38F) and my wife (47F) have two kids (3M &amp; 1F) and are very happily married. We try to split up chores around the house as best as possible whilst also taking care of the kids. Our chores have been the same since we moved in together 10 years ago. I've offered to shift or update the chores but my wife always declines saying she likes her set. Of the set chores, she does the dishes and I do the laundry. It has been a running bicker that she feels she has to do \"more work\" because sometimes food or napkins will be left on a dish and that takes her time to empty out. Now I'm not talking hard dried on food, we don't let dishes sit that long, but just soft food. We are all offenders, but typically its dinner time when the kids have finished eating and we whisk them for baths and bedtime and then we come back to clean up the kitchen and there are still remnants of food. I've tried to make things better by cleaning off plates while she bathes the kids but as soon as another incident occurs she gets salty.\n\nI want to state, I say bicker because it's not a true argument or a fight, just something that grinds her gears or ends up being an outlet for her to vent her frustrations when she is stressed. It's never been a true fight and anytime I offer to trade a chore she refuses.\n\nNow I do the laundry and with 2 kids, two adults, and a dog it can be a lot. Kids go through multiple clothes a day, plus towels, bibs, etc. And my wife wears multiple layers most days, so the laundry can pile up. I don't mind doing it but I try to explain that laundry is more labor intensive than dishes in that I have to carry the laundry up and down the stairs, treat, wash, fold, dry, etc. I go through pockets because she has a tendency to leave her work USB drives in her pocket and I also turn everything inside right both before washing and before I fold. I've told her me going through all her clothes, checking her pockets and turning everyones clothes inside right is about the same time if not more than her scrapping a few bowls. Just to be clear, my wife hardly ever takes off a piece of clothing and puts it in the laundry inside right. Every piece of clothing she takes off of her or the kids is ALWAYS inside out. I've asked her to please try and keep them inside right but she eventually stops trying. When I point it out she says it can't take much time to turn a few clothes inside right.\n\nShe doubled down recently because I was taking care of the kids in the morning, I got myself a bowl of cereal and ended up forgetting about it. She came down and got mad that there was food left in the bowl on the table. I told her I had forgotten about it and would have tended to it as soon as I came in to the kitchen. We bickered and she once again said I had it easy because all I had to do was turn a few clothes inside right. So I decided to be petty.\n\nI had the day off yesterday and was home alone. I pulled out all her clothes, underwear, jeans, all her hang-ups, socks, EVERYTHING, and turned them all inside out. This morning when she went to get dressed for work she got frustrated because all her clothes were inside out! When she asked me what happened, I told her well you said that turning a few pieces of clothing inside right didn't take so long and was no big deal so I figured you wouldn't mind. She is still salty...",

When you go to put them on, then the person turns them right side out. It's a bit annoying, but it sounds like she is complaining about dumb stuff. And if she loses a USB because she didn't empty her own pockets\u2026she'll learn fast.",

Nor does there need to be\u2026\u2026explain to her what bothers you with the laundry and tell her to check her pockets and turn the garments. Then wash them as you find them\u2026..you are already helping scrape the dishes so not sure why she is unhappy about that. Who cuts the grass, takes out the garbage, shovels the snow., deals with the vehicles, repairs to the home, etc ec etc\u2026if she cooks and cleans then I'd say it's as equitable as it can be. The biggest responsibility wives have is cooking the meals, day after day after day. I'd trade that chore for just about any other task\u2026sigh, I digress but I think something else is going on here with her\u2026talk to her..maybe she's feeling overwhelmed.",

We live at the end of a long driveway so lots of snow to deal with in the winter\u2026he also deals with the garbage and recycling , he also maintains the lawn mower, snowblower, boat, etc\u2026.he handles the maintenance on our vehicles and our house\u2026.he does many many things that usually fall on the man of the house..he also keeps the mudroom clean. He cooks occasionally and does a lot of dishes\u2026so when I say it's never going to be 50-50 it's because he is doing more than 50%\u2026. He does more than me\u2026why should he have to do laundry? Inside is mostly my domain but it's less than what he does. It's never going to be equitable..it doesn't need to be if that's how I want to do things. Each couple needs to find the balance that works for them\u2026.it's not a 50-50 issue, it's what ever works for you and hubby.",

On its face, this is a funny story, but it shows a lack of true communication and listening on both your parts, leading to frustration and disrespect. Having young ones in the house is the hardest things to adjust to, and requires kindness, patience, flexibility and support from each spouse. I've seen too many friends go through divorce over this trend caused by stress and lack of sleep and increased responsibilities from childrearing. Go talk and listen to each other. Sure you may feel that your wife is being unkind in how she reminds you to do dishes, but I also hear her say that she has too much on her plate and needs help. Listen, don't belittle. Figure out ways to make each other feel cared for. Please, for your kids.",

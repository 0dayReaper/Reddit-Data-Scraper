    "postText": "Mid-pandemic my boss disappeared. \n\nJust as we were gearing up for our most challenging, time intensive, project in the last five years, he dropped off the face of the earth. \n\nWe kept working for a week or so without him because everything was virtual and the virtual work world was still so new, we didn\u2019t really need him. We were delegating tasks ourselves and completing things on our own. We spoke to coworkers maybe twice a week. \n\nBut some decisions were beyond our discretion, so we could not move forward on those aspects of the project until we received a response from him. \n\nAfter about 7-10 total days of silence, we called his boss\u2019s boss, who informed our team that our boss had COVID so wasn\u2019t able to work right now. \n\nWe took that at face value of course sent him letters of well-wishes and didn\u2019t bother him with work stuff, or ask why he was able to notify his boss but not us. \n\nThree weeks go by. Still not a word. We\u2019re beginning to discuss amongst ourselves whether or not he\u2019s maybe died. We\u2019re terrified and horrified and so concerned. We\u2019re contemplating calling his extended family. We\u2019re sending flowers and care packages to his apartment. \n\nMeanwhile, the project has descended into chaos because no leader was appointed in our boss\u2019s stead, so we are forced to navigate several layers of bureaucracy in order to accomplish most anything at all (whereas in the past he would\u2019ve just signed off in real time.)\n\nAround week four or five one of our coworkers suggests he doesn\u2019t really have COVID but is instead using it as an excuse to take time off. We all jump all over our coworker, asking how he could insinuate something like that, and lamenting about what a tragedy our boss is probably living through. People were chilly to him for days after that. \n\nWeek seven. We\u2019re undertaking a letter writing campaign to upper management demanding an acting boss be appointed while ours is recovering. The project is a month behind schedule. We\u2019re all working overtime every day, sometimes on weekends, without extra compensation, just to keep up with the cluster fuck of the boss\u2019s sudden absence. \n\nWeek eight. He finally reappears, logging into a morning meeting as though nothing happened. He looks well rested, well fed, and has a tan. Not at all like someone who\u2019s just come out the other side of a six week respiratory virus.  \n\nHe says something quickly to the effect of \u201cYah, that was brutal. Glad to be better and glad to be back. Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d But doesn\u2019t want to talk about what happened or answer any of our questions like, \u201cWere you in the hospital?\u201d \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d Etc.\n\nFast forward to about four or five months after this. My sister sends me a promo for a fairly new reality show (I\u2019d never heard of it but it\u2019s on a major platform) and says \u201cIsn\u2019t this guy a friend of yours or something? I swear I\u2019ve seen him and you together.\u201d\n\nI watch the trailer for this show, and lo and behold, there\u2019s my boss. Participating as a contestant on a reality TV show. \n\nIt did not take long for me to put the pieces together and realize he took extended leave to go on TV (that he knew he wouldn\u2019t otherwise get during this massive project) and lied about it under the guise of a vicious disease that nearly all of us had lost a loved one to. \n\nI sit and stew with this information, unsure of how to handle it. I know confronting him won\u2019t get me very far, but I can\u2019t just do nothing, right? I\u2019m not close enough with any of my colleagues to discuss this with them and trust that they wouldn\u2019t run off and send an all-company email about it. \n\nSo I slept on it a few nights and then the opportunity fell right in my lap. \n\nI got an email from corporate encouraging teams still working remotely to plan \u201cvirtual social functions\u201d to keep a collegial culture going and to stay in touch. \n\nAmong the suggestions were: game night, trivia, and\u2026 watch party.\n\nWith the premier of the show only a couple weeks away I got busy telling everyone how I\u2019d been meaning to get into this show, and it\u2019s so enticing and exciting, basically laying the groundwork to guilt them into coming to an impromptu virtual watch party off-hours. \n\nI offered to get special shirts made up and send them to each person\u2019s house. Whatever I had to do to get the attention of corporate. \n\nFinally, I sent an e-vite to all my boss\u2019s bosses, and any other members of corporate I could justify inviting without making a total ass of myself. \n\nBecause this is entirely virtual, my boss is unable to overhear any of the chatter. He doesn\u2019t realize I\u2019m hyping up this show and he doesn\u2019t realize I\u2019ve planned a watch party for it. I wasn\u2019t inviting him unless he had the balls to explicitly ask about it. \n\nI was hoping he wouldn\u2019t have heard about it at all! Not until afterwards. That was really the only way this could work. \n\nThe night comes and I am screensharing the show to a whopping 64 people. A huge chunk of my department. Many members of corporate had showed up because I was the only person stupid enough to buy into their virtual social work party scheme, so they felt pressured to support it. \n\nI was holding my breath, hoping this would go my way, bracing myself for some kind of curveball. But there wasn\u2019t even that dramatic of a buildup. Right at the outset they introduced the premise (which included the contestants being in a covid-safe bubble in an exotic location!!) and gave a brief overview of each contestant. \n\nAs my boss was introduced, right down to what he did for work, and I could see people register delight and surprise\u2026 then go blank\u2026 just before sliding into confusion and rage. \n\nThe chat took a *drastic* turn from \u201cOh my goodness!\u201d And \u201cI knew him when!\u201d And all sorts of pithy jokes to a brave member of my team (or perhaps one just pushed a tad too far by all the extra hours he pulled in this douche\u2019s absence) sent the message, *\u201dWait, when was this filmed?\u201d*\n\nMy audience dropped from 64 to 58 to mid-30s, and by the time the episode was over it was just me and the other 15 core members of the team. \n\nOne asked if I\u2019d already known, but some members of the team are very close to the boss, so all I said was \u201cWell I definitely do now.\u201d And wrapped up the call pretty quickly after that. \n\nPerhaps one of the best bonuses is that you could already tell from episode one that the character arc the show assigned to our boss was \u201cbumbling idiot\u201d. He had his true colors on in full display and some production-massaging upped them to the 11th degree. \n\nBoss was fired. My good buddy was promoted to his place. I am an office legend now (especially since no one is 100% sure whether or not it was intentional.) And it was all so satisfying that it was almost worth the dozens of hours of uncompensated overtime that led to it.\n\n*Edit - title should be eight weeks. I kept not factoring in the first couple weeks because we weren\u2019t suspicious (or burdened) until the final six.*",

A TV show! Like....of all the things, being part of a filmed TV show would really increase ones chances of being found out. And yet he still lied about where he was for 8 weeks. So dumb. \n\nI want to know what show this was and how far into it your boss went.

OP states they saw the promo 4-5 months after boss reappears. So that would put boss\u2019 reappearance at around March/April.\n\nBoss disappears for 2 months, so the start of the disappearance would be Jan/Feb, which wouldn\u2019t really put it in \u201cmid-pandemic\u201d.\n\nHowever, Vulture reported that pre-production for season 2 started in July 2020, which doesn\u2019t match OP\u2019s timeline. Also, I personally wouldn\u2019t consider Vegas to be an \u201cexotic location\u201d lol\n\nSo based on the above, I think it\u2019s a different show, I just don\u2019t know what lol",

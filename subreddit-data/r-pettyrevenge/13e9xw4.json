    "postText": "\nWhen I was a Uni Student, I picked up a second job at Fish and Chip franchise run by a wealthy middle-aged women and owned by her and her radio personality husband which was definitely operating it at a loss. This didn\u2019t seem to bother her as it was clearly a hobby for her. Quickly it became obvious that they had a seriously fast staff turnover issue. They had one manager who had been there about a year and no other service staff that had been there more than a few weeks. I already had years of hospitality experience at this point and was quite comfortable the with processes and cash machine system which I brought up multiple times, but I was stuck running food the whole time because the manager had become used to doing everything himself and untrusting after seeing so many staff come and go and clearly just found that easier. \n\nI worked here 1 day a week only working 4-hour shifts as their opening hours were just a small window in the evening. This job was a complete waste of my time and I was being treated like a child. I worked here for about 2 months and in this time she had never bothered to pay me and always had an excuse. I had become fed up and sent her my letter of resignation and told her that I was coming before university to pick up the money she had owed me to which she said \u2018fine\u2019. I also added that I would be on my way to class and didn\u2019t have long (the restaurant was next to the train station that I took to Uni) so to please have my money ready in cash (typical for hospitality). I arrive and she\u2019s talking to a customer/friend, I decided that she knew I didn\u2019t have long and would surely wrap it up to pay me and set me on my way, but she proceeded to small talk with this women for 10 minutes while I politely waved and made eye contact gesturing at my wrist watch implying I had to go to which she held up a finger to me multiple times implying \u2018just a moment\u2019. This went on for an unreasonable amount of time and she was clearly power tripping and being rude, so after missing my train I said in my outdoor voice \u2018PAY ME THE MONEY YOU OWE ME OR IM CALLING THE POLICE\u2019. She scoffed and took me behind the counter and asked the manager to provide her with the \u2018red binder\u2019, to which he replied, \u2018what red binder?\u2019.  \n\n\u2018You know, the one with everyone\u2019s shifts and payroll stuff.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never heard or seen of such a binder\u2019 said her manager, \n\nThey argue back and forth for a minute or so, I don\u2019t believe that this binder even exists at this point. She turns to me and says, \u2018what do I owe you, how many hours did you work?\u2019 \n\nI say \u2018I worked 51 hours\u2019 (I had probably worked around 9-15 hours). To my surprise she then proceeds to unlock her cash box in her office and hand me $1,100 and throw it into and envelope for me, I thank her and powerwalk out of there before the manager who had walked away at this point caught wind of my lie. I couldn\u2019t believe it, this lady had just paid me 4x what I was owed.\n\nI was probably only owed around $250 which if she had any organisational skills would have paid me already, and she would have known the amount if she made any effort to keep track of her employee\u2019s rosters. \n\n\n\nTL;DR be rude, entitled, make me miss my train and don\u2019t pay me what you owe me? You pay the troll toll.",

            "comment": "This story smells fishy to me. I'm frying my brain trying to consolidate your recount with what I know, having worked the industry in this country. This is either over-exaggerated or, never even happened at all. We have very strict labour laws in Australia, and an employer not paying you for 2 months would have been promptly reported. Based on what you have claimed about this employer and the high turnover, they would have been doing this to other current and former staff members and wouldn't have gotten away with it.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I worked in the busiest fish n chip shop in my area for a couple of years. I considered it to be a fine, albeit occasionally crumby job, with a great, hard-working, and fun crew. The boss could be a bit stingy but never screwed around with our pay. \n\nFirstly, openers are always a manager and a prep cook because it is the slowest part of the day, so only one person needs to be there to do the cooking while the other person has time to do all the prep for the lunch and dinner rushes. A non manager staff member who only worked once a week on the till is only ever needed on the Friday and Saturday dinner rushes. They aren't needed any other time. An opening shift is for getting prep work done, and there are few enough customers that can be easily handled by the supervisor (normally also the main fry cook) and the prep chef (the job I did). So it would be a truly insane business decision to waste a wage during those times on someone who isn't doing anything other than till work and possibly cleaning or restocking the drinks fridges (10 minute jobs at most for a capable worker). It would have *maybe* made more sense if they said they were on a closing (dinner) shift.\n\nEven then, the labour laws are so strict here that thorough records have to be kept to protect both the workers and the business. And even if an owner is paying you under-the-table, it's usually to keep costs down (like prevent paying full rates or taxes on salary), and are stingy enough to not pay for those things, you can bet they are gonna be stingy enough to keep track of hours so they don't over pay you and keel the scales balanced. \n\nThis story feels more like a fantasy by someone with a chip on their shoulder. \n\n\n\n(All puns fully intented)",

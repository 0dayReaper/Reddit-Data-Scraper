    "postText": "Today, my wife (W) and I were on a cruise in the Atlantic Ocean. We wanted to hang by the pool, so around 11 my wife heads to find some lounge chairs while I get changed. My wife finds 2 open chairs and sets up camp. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later, enter Entitled Bitch (EB). She storms up and immediately starts getting aggressive with W, \u201cI had towels on the chair, they were reserved, you can\u2019t move them. So move\u201d. My wife calmly responds saying the chairs were empty, so sorry. \n\nEB gets her husband and tries to get him to bully W. He wants no part and finds a chair somewhere else. I wound up arriving and EB sunk away and found a chair a few down from us. \n\nThe couple next to us said that she was an absolute Bitch to them, and when she disappeared a few hours earlier she mentioned to staff and they took the towels away. \n\nA few hours later her friends showed up and started asking about the chairs. EB loudly said we stole their chairs and she didn\u2019t understand why we weren\u2019t giving them back to her. We kept quiet and just listened. One seat opened next to us, at which point we grabbed for a friend who was meeting us. \n\nAnother two hours go by and the entire time EB is staring at us and talking under her breath. We start getting up to leave, and EB starts hovering. We notice 3 women standing behind us. I ask if they are looking for seats. They say no. My wife goes up and explains what happened and how much of a B EB was being. They jumped at it and came and sat down as we got our stuff. \n\nEB came over and asked them if she could sit next to her husband. They feigned entertaining the idea, but also understood the mission and said no. EB stormed off and sulked. \n\nSo proud of W and the 7 people who came together to put an EB in their place.",

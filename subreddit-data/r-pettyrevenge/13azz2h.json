    "postText": "My sister and I just finished grocery shopping, and I was pushing the cart with our groceries to my car when all of a sudden I hear a honk behind us. I was confused because we were not in the way at all. In fact if I moved anymore to the parked cars I would\u2019ve hit them with my cart. He flipped us off and parked his car. My sister and I looked at each other confused, but honestly I was feeling mad. I noticed he parked his car next to the area where you are suppose to drop off your carts. I also noticed he was just dropping someone off, and is about to leave. I told my sister to go into the car, and I\u2019ll handle the groceries. I hurriedly put the groceries away in my trunk, and headed to the drop off area for carts except I put my cart right behind his car. I quickly walked back to my car, and explained eveything to my sister. We were still able to see his car where I was parked, so we were just waiting to see his reaction. After a few seconds, we see the car backing up and BAM HITS THE CART! I quickly drove off after that, so I\u2019m not sure if he damaged his car.I didn\u2019t think he would hit the cart. My original revenge-intent was going to be that he would have  to get out of his car and move the cart and it would just be an annoying inconvenience for him, but I guess that worked too. Not my fault he didn\u2019t check his mirrors.",

The oncoming lane clears and the cart is still there.  Before I can get out some fool in a pickup behind me starts honking.  I am in the left lane, there is plenty of room to go around me on the right.  So I decide to sit and let the guy honk.  After 15 seconds he puts it in reverse, blaring his horn he charges at me like he is going to slam into my rear end.  I cannot go because the cart is against my bumper. Then last minute he swerves around me, simultaneously the wind put the cart in his lane.  He hits it, it folds under his truck, sparks, horrible metal tearing sound, steam, blue smoke.  Path was clear so I turned left.  He was still there when I left for home 45 minutes later.",

I don't like Wallmart, though they seem cleaner than my youth experiences.\n\n Poor management sunk K-mart and Sears both imo. Folks would pay a little more for the great old Sears service and good reliable product, good return policies, etc. newer management didn't deliver it. So they lost the loyal customer base all together.\n\n That didn't help Kmart when they merged imo. I had already dropped Sears fully by then, going way out of my way to hand my money to Kmart or others.\n\n Kmart (&amp; parent Kresgee) was very similar to how Wallmart is now when I was young. Buildings a little smaller for K mart and Sears because there just weren't as many shoppers or products. \n\n  I was not impressed by the quality of early Wallmarts that I saw; and was very glad they weren't around us to mess with well established companies back then. \n\n  Wallyworlds size and product pricing hurt overall market quality once they entered a local market imo. \n\n  They are also slime, that seldom holds up their end of a bargain once a building is erected and opened. Sears especially, and K-mart to a lesser degree on the other hand were pretty community conscious in my experience.\n\n More similar to WM than Sears,  but K-mart managed to mix in a little fun with things like the \"blue light specials\". Those were unadvertised sales. They would roll a cart with a tall  pole and large blue police light on top \ud83d\udea8 turn it on so you could spot it about anywhere in the store, and make an announcement on the P.A. about the sale. \n\nI miss old school Kmart, not so much later Kmart. Same buildings etc. too.",

I think rural areas just appreciated their Walmarts more because that's all there was for them. Consumer demand of quality wasn't as high there as around me elsewhere; price alone became more and more the main selling point vs quality. That trend continued to grow too.  (imo) I don't think we are nearly as smart a group of shoppers as our Great elders. Even some boomers make us look comparably dumb.",

    "postText": "When I was in 7th grade, I used to play paper football with my friend every day at lunch. You know, the game where you flick a triangle of paper between the \"goalposts\" made by your opponent's fingers? Well, this pass time was inevitably noticed by a couple of bullies that had been troubling me for years. They began to steal our football each day.\n\nThis happened for multiple days in a row. They'd approach, steal the football, ridicule me, and then throw the football away. I began to become increasingly frustrated, as this was only the most recent in a long line of indignities inflicted upon me by these two. I decided that I would get my revenge.\n\nMy first thought was to fill the meaner bully's locker entirely with paper footballs. I figured if he really wanted my paper footballs, he should have them, right? That night, I enlisted my mom's help, and we spent several hours folding paper. It quickly became apparent that my original plan was overambitious. The sheer volume of paper that filling an entire locker would require was more than we had on hand, to say nothing of the time and effort \nit would require. Still, by the time we were done, I had a lunch sack full of faux sports paraphernalia.\n\nThe next day, I sat across from my friend as usual, and placed the sack on my lap out of sight under the table. We began our game, and right on cue the bullies pounced. I didn't react to the theft. I merely reached into the bag on my lap, retrieved a new football, and resumed play.\n\nThey stole that one too.\n\nSo I pulled out another one.\n\nWhich they stole.\n\nSo I got another one.\n\nThey took that too.\n\nThis went on for the entire lunch period. The lead bully would steal the ball and pass it to his minion to throw away. I would produce a new ball, and it would immediately be stolen and passed to the minion as soon as he got back. Every time this happened, my friend would urge me to pull out another one (I hadn't filled him in on my scheme, so he was delighted every time that I did). By the time lunch was over, all four of us were laughing too hard to even speak. The bullies didn't say anything to me as they left, simply shaking their heads while grinning in disbelief. My friend only said \"That was awesome.\" When all was said and done, I still had about 15 footballs left.\n\nThose two particular bullies never bothered me again. Not just during lunch, but ever. I don't know if this technically qualifies as \"petty revenge\" or not. My original idea of filling his locker certainly would have. But I think it evolved into something better. I had a lot of run-ins with bullies over the course of my school career. I came out of top in very few of them. Still, this is the one instance that I'm most proud of myself for, and I hadn't ever told the story. I hope you enjoyed it.",

    "postText": "My neighbors have 9 cars total parked in the street. They always park two of those cars in front on my house and won\u2019t move them the whole week. We have a regulation where u live that you can\u2019t leave your car parked for more than 48 hrs in the same spot.\n\nMy neighbors have a pretty big driveway where they can fit four cars, but it\u2019s always empty. They have told me they don\u2019t like to leave their driveway with cars because it looks tacky. \n\nOver half the cars they have they don\u2019t even use them. They just use them to safe parking spots for themselves. In 2021 I noticed they where building a second unit I\u2019m back of their main house. I noticed that they completed the house in under a month. This raised some red flags because it takes anywhere from 2-3 months with city inspections taking the majority of time.\n\nI submitted a ticket with my city through the app and advised them that their might be some illegal residential building without permits. I didn\u2019t think of it much until a year later. \n\nI noticed my neighbors tearing down their second unit last week. Word got around our block that a city inspector was there making sure everything was being torn down. Based on what they materials and labor they put into their second unit I cost them over $100,000.",

It belonged to the wife's father (he died rather suddenly) and it was parked in front and NEVER moved. after two years of it being there I asked if they could please move the truck so I could rake my leaves out in the street (it being fall) and have the street sweeper pick them up. The husband asked where he could park it- I suggested in front of his house. He then stated the view that it might get hit by a car turning onto the street (it was a corner house) and I countered that the truck hadn't been inspected in well over a year and inquired if it was registered and insured-as required by the state of NJ and the town we lived in. Next day the truck was gone. I felt a little bad but the damn thing sat there for 2 years not moving!",

Because it leaked oil and they didn't want the oil leak in front of their house.  So I called parking enforcement and they started tagging the car and when it had been there 48 hours, they towed it!  The neighbors were pissed at me because the son had to spend over $200 to get his car back.  But, he never parked it in front of my house again.  Another thing is, check the registrations on the cars.  If any are expired, report them and get the car towed.",

    "postText": "This story took place in my petty years, when I was a sophomore living with two roommates in college.\n\nOne day my leftover in the fridge looked like it shrank in portion overnight?! I thought I was hallucinating. Another evening I came home, absolutely ravenous after night classes. I found the saved saut\u00e9ed chicken that I had cooked the day before, popped it in the microwave only to find... wait a minute... why is all the chicken gone?! As in, the veggies were there, but all the pieces of chicken had been picked almost clean! Unless we had a burglar who broken in just to pick the meat out of my leftover, it probably had to do with one of the roommates, both of whom denied it vehemently. I knew it was probably this roommate, let's call him Tony, who always stayed home to watch porn all day.\n\nBefore then, I had never cooked or even brought pork dishes back to the house out of respect for Tony, a Muslim. But this time he really pissed me off. Same day next week, I brought home a fried pork dish that resembled fried chicken bits, left it in the fridge, then out to night classes as usual. Lo and behold, when I came home, Tony looked like he had swallowed a bug! Sure enough, all the \"chicken\" nuggets were gone.\n\nFrom that day on I rarely saw Tony, who kept mainly to his room watching porn. I heard he got a mini fridge though hahaha.",

Turns out what he meant was, he wasn't sharing his food, just ours. One day the other three of us came home and his door wasn't shut all the way. We went in and took every bit of food he had in there. When he got home he went ballistic. Of course none of us knew anything about his missing food, but we thought maybe it might have been the same person that kept coming in and stealing our food. We never missed any food again.",

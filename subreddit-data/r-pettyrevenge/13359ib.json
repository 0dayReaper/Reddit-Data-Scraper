    "postText": "This is pretty recent. To make things short: I broke off my engagement and asked for our relationship to improve before marriage. He said no. I said ok. Then he came home and told me that everything was going to be fine and he loved me etc, and then called me on the phone two hours later to say \"I only proposed because I felt pity for you, and I won't go to therapy because the only problem I have in my life is you\". I blocked him everywhere.\n\nHe still have his things in my house, so I took all the clothes and sewed socks together, sewed pants legs with the butt part of the pants, sewed the holes for the head/arms in his t-shirts. I put everything in a case and wrote a note that said \"I hope this is not pitiful to you, have fun!\". \n\nJust to be clear I didn't broke his clothes or anything, I even put a tool to rip the stitches in the case and did not touch clothes which fabric could be ripped if sewed. \n\nI'm feeling kind of guilty already, but I just discovered like 10 minutes ago an eyeliner that was not mine in his backpack. \n\nHe is coming for his stuff tomorrow and I won't be here. A friend will handle everything.",

He knew how great you are and he treated you like crap to wear you down to keep you from leaving his sorry butt because he knew you could do way better than him, and he thought he could have his cake (you) and eat it too (eyeliner of unknown origin = cheating or he's wearing it himself = not inherently bad but he's definitely hiding something big which IS bad)",

Then he called off the engagement a short while later, a week after we told both our families/found a venue/my parents bought me a dress/etc. I was even stupid enough to date him *again* 6 months after that. Man, I was in love and hooked. Then I accidentally met someone the week after I would have gotten married. And he treated me so well. Better than anyone, ever. And we were only friends! Until we weren't. We've been married almost 21 years. Best person I've ever met. I love him more literally every day. Am still crazy stupid in love with him. Like, make funny faces to make him laugh crazy stupid in love. It's out there, I believe that for everyone.

So many nice people helped me get through this all. You will feel better in a few days, weeks, you will feel better.",

Anyway, she unpicked every third stitch in every third suit when we found out he was happily living in a flat with an affair partner. Mans suit fell apart when he got out of mid life crisis car. \n\nSeriously he was a monster so it\u2019s a light punishment for what he eventually did to us. \n\nMy friend, what you did is an inconvenience to this asshole, and it\u2019s akin to wishing he never has dry socks again in his life. Or hoping he steps on a Lego. No big deal, but you know it\u2019ll make him so unreasonably mad, so it\u2019s totally appropriate. \n\nSo I hope he drops his toast butter side down for the rest of his life.",

I had warned him before that I was not going to marry him unless he took therapy and he said he didn't want to loose me so he was going to do it. I waited TWO YEARS and he never did and got upset at me when I reminded him of our deal. \n\nTo clarify he was never violent towards me he just had some unresolved issues and I wanted him to get better so our conversations and decisions would be taken from a partnership and companionship place, not like rivals but like team. He didn't like that, and apparently he liked me even less given that he only proposed out of pity (his words).",

A healthy marriage is 100% from both sides all the time because sometimes, our 100% isn't enough and we need our partner to carry some of our burdens or responsibilities.  Or they need us to do so.  And because sometimes, both of us at 100% isn't quite enough.  \n\nI cannot imagine continuing to progress towards marriage with someone who can't give you the simple respect of bringing their best self to your marriage.",

Next was her husband's gleaming BMW which she ruined by pouring five litres of white paint all over it.

She then ripped up Sir Peter\u2019s favourite pictures, before finally piling up the debris into \"a big sculpture.\"\n\n\"I'm normally quite in control of my emotions,\" said the aristocratic vandal after the event. \"In fact I am quite shocked by what I have done.\"\n\nWhen asked why she had cut the sleeves off his suits, she memorably said: \u201cHe only needed one arm for what he does best.\u201d\n\nSir Peter reckoned his wife\u2019s revenge cost him \u00a335,000.",

She invited us over and we went to town unscrewing everything, our tech friend destroyed all his gaming stats so he was no longer \"The Best\" and said friend cut open the mattress and put kitty litter and some of his frozen snake mice into the mattress before sewing it back up. There some other stuff too but it was like 10 years ago so I can't exactly remember what else we did, only because he was so pissed about the funky smell and the fact she ruined his gaming stats....also his furniture kept mysteriously breaking",

About 30 seconds per sleeve or pant leg, including transition time. On the other hand, based on what OP said about the types of stitches and spacing they used, ripping the stitches back out will take at least a couple minutes per sleeve or pant leg. The clothes will be fine as long as the ex is careful, but the ROI on time is significant",

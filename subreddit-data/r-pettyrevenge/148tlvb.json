Then my classmate wanted to do the same thing and brought the stuff and everything! She was really excited... but then she overheard the \"mean girls\" talking shit about her and they threatened her reputation. \n\nSo she didn't do it! \n\nShe is really insecure about her popularity, HOWEVER, she is friends with my best friend and I have a soft spot for some good ol vengeance :). Also I couldn't give two shits about my popularity so HAH SUCK IT MEAN GIRL-. \n\nAnyways I'm making cookie dough (edible) during my lunch period and giving it to everyone except them!",

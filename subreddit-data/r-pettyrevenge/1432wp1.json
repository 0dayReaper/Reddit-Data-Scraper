    "postText": "I recently posted to reddit about an iOS game I published 2 years prior which was a flop. Someone posted a nice reply, then PMed me to say they'd left a review (the only one) and rated it 5 stars (one of 2 ratings). They also asked me to play their game and rate it (but only if 4 stars or higher).\n\nI played their game for an hour and sent back a bunch of constructive feedback. I also explained that due to numerous hangs and unlicensed content I would withhold my rating for now, but let me know when the problems are fixed and I'll have another look.\n\nI just realised that they removed their review and changed their rating to 1 star. My game now has 100% less reviews than before, and the average rating has dropped from 5 to 3 stars. Grrrrrrr. \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd23\n\nUpdate:\n\nHad a chat with them, and they assure me it was a mistake and the changes would be reverted in the next few hours. That\u2019s good enough for me. \ud83d\udc4d",

I also don't want to get them in serious trouble, nor do I want them to spread their pettiness to my other apps and interests (given that their initial pettiness was a response to what I thought was me being generous and kind).",

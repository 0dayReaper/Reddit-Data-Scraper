    "postText": "This happened over 35 years ago. I was a lifeguard/counselor at a Boy Scout summer camp. For whatever the reason, all us lifeguards were labeled as the troublemakers of the camp. Especially when it came to playing pranks, which we called \u201cmidnight maintenance.\u201d  One of the guys who worked in the kitchen was a good guy, very hard working, but he was autistic. Some of the other kitchen staff used to dump on him &amp; give him a real hard time. The very last night of camp, we called the kitchen on the camp phone &amp; told them they we\u2019re getting payback for abusing the hard worker all summer.  We didn\u2019t do anything to them, we just hid in the woods by their campsite laughing our asses off watching them set up booby traps that backfired &amp; watching them freak out every time they heard something moving in the brush. They were up all night waiting for the moment that never came. The next morning they were running off their mouths saying we\u2019re all talk, no action. Then we told them how we pranked them by not pranking them &amp; how lame their booby traps were.",

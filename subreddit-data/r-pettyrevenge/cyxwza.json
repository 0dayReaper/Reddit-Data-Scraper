    "postText": "\n\nSo title is fairly self explanatory but I'll elaborate. I  was trying to find a parking spot at my university. The lot was notoriously crowded but my campus didn't have a lot of options. While searching, I saw a Corvette taking up FOUR prime spots near the front of the lot. After about ten minutes of waiting/looking for a spot one opened up towards the back of the lot. Furious at the nerve of the driver being so inconsiderate, I wrote a note saying, \"Sorry I hit your car, you probably won't even notice the damage\" and left it on their windshield. When I got out of class and was headed back to my car, I saw a very stereotypical college aged Corvette owner frantically searching their vehicle while yelling into their phone. I don't know who they were talking to, but I feel bad for them having to deal with this person.",

It's literally designed to be efficient for space. I hate shitty drivers/ parkers even more than I love petty revenge, I'm afraid to say.

Sometimes the note is nice, other times they won\u2019t be subtle. \u201cSorry I hit your car. Maybe if you didn\u2019t park like a prick I wouldn\u2019t have hit it.\u201d\n\nThe people then call the comedian. It\u2019s usually funny. Some people say they couldn\u2019t find a dent so don\u2019t worry about it. Others call with all kinds of damage. \n\nThe comedian comes up with weird places that he hit them. \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t find anything? Did you check the top of your roof?\u201d Or that he broke in and slept in the backseat and accidentally ripped the leather. \n\nOne good one is he will say he scratched the window when he was leaving over to car to leave the note. Some people get wooshed. Others will try and reason with him and they go back and forth over it. \n(I wonder how many of you right now don\u2019t get it?)",

It gets irritating cause the people who park next to you dont pay attention. They park close to your door and make it hard to get in to your own car, or they park crooked..",

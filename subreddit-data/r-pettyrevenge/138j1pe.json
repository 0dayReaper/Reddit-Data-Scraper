    "postText": "\n\nAbout six years ago, my former partner of six years and I broke up, and I started to realise all of the things I had normalised were actually abuse.\nInstances of gas lighting were all too prevalent (even one instance where she gaslit me about what gaslighting even was), financial (she could spend what she wanted, I had to ask permission), even limiting time that I spent with my family and my best mate. There was more, but that's enough of that.\n\nAfter we broke up, I realised that money I had continued to place into our joint account wasn't going to the mortgage as promised, but was going to shopping, paying for her new partner (who, it turned out, was on the scene months before we split...and wasn't the first!) and payments to her lawyer. \n\nWhen I found this out, I called the finance company handling our mortgage and told them I would no longer be making payments. I told them they could sieze the house if they wanted, but my half of the payments would cease immediately until I had recouped the money stolen, roughly five months worth of payments. \n\nThey said I couldn't do that. \nI told them to watch me. \n\nSoon after that, when the debt letters and dishonours started, the texts, phone calls, and voice mails from her started....I ignored every one. \n\nTwo months in,\u00a0 I heard her car broke down badly because she couldn't afford to maintain it. \n\nNot long after that,\u00a0 she filed for bankruptcy. \n\nA month later, she moved out and I got my house back. \nI cleaned it up, changed the locks, got my mortgage back in front....and recently my wife and I sold it for a tidy little profit. \n\nShe got nothing.\nNot a dollar, not a dime. \n\nShe has no usable credit rating, and my wife and I are debt free with a deposit on our new home. \n\nFeels good.",

It also would have destroyed your credit. Banks aren't nice about this stuff. If you're ex didn't already have debt letters coming in that meant they were paying, they probably just didn't use the joint account.",

It's also possible that the bank didn't report them as late. \n\nI had a financial crisis about a decade ago that nearly wiped me out, including falling 6 months behind on my mortgage. I managed to get out of it and kept the house, but my credit was ruined. I wrote the bank a letter asking for a good faith adjustment to my payment history for those months. \n\nThe next month all of the late payments disappeared. They don't show up as \"on time\", they simply show \"no information available\". Which was as far as my credit is concerned is as good as an on time payment, literally jumped my score 200pts overnight.",

They usually start the pre-foreclosure process at around 3-6 months, which is where I was. It can take a year or more for the actual foreclosure to happen.\n\nSome banks are better than others (and some are terrible), but generally speaking they're not too keen to take over a property (then they're legally obligated to maintain it). They'd rather you just get current and keep giving them money every month.\n\nHowever, once you're actually foreclosed, the bank has to put the house up for auction. You have up until the day it is auctioned to get current on your mortgage.",

The ex cleans out the accounts and suddenly OP is able to come up with all of the money defaulted on for months, plus the interest and anything the bank adds on for penalties? My family member's house was foreclosed on in a divorce. The foreclosure process took some time and notification. Once the house was foreclosed on, there is an eviction process. The eviction process can take a bit, but once everyone is out and the forclosure is done? In two weeks the house goes up for auction. My family member was able to rally the rest of the family for money to fish it out literally at the last minute, but it was not easy and the extra fees were not a joke. Their credit was affected for many years. OP's story that there was no impact on their credit and they just sailed through all of this like a breeze is total nonsense.",

I don't understand how more of my fellow Americans don't understand this.\n\nBecause it honestly does not make sense. \n\nIn Bankruptcy, even with differences of AU law, the institution which holds the mortgage would have to notified of said bankruptcy. Then, a trustee would be appointed. Then, said trustee will have to seize and sell assets of the bankrupt. Most likely, the asset, the home, would be sold at an auction. Which, admittedly, is quite rare because typically residential homes are exempt for bankruptcy (thinking is that people gotta have a roof over their heads).\n\nEven more confusing, the OP effectively stated him and his ex were both in default. Well, going through bankruptcy would have not theoretically cut her interest in the property. She would still be an owner until foreclosed, property sold at auction, and which again is most likely difficult. \n\nFurthermore, the OP stated he paid up on the mortgage and was eventually compliant. But, if that is the case, then so too would his ex be compliant. The lender doesn't care if two owners pay 50-50, only that the full amount is paid. \n\nI am real estate attorney who has done foreclosure in the US and even I am confused about this whole ordeal. Even more so when a quick google search will show there is a 3 year and 1 day waiting period for bankruptcies in AU yet OP states he got outright ownership of his house in mere months. \n\nI am not saying OP is lying and quite honestly do not care enough. However, I am sick of seeing this \"Americans think the world revolves around them\" simply because an American is questioning the validity of the post. Quite frankly, this post makes fuck all sense from a legal perspective whether in the US or AU.",

After the 'foreclosure crises', there were many banks trying to avoid too many foreclosures for several years.\n\nIf the bank was trying to work with his ex when her car died it could have caused her finances to fall down around her like a row of dominoes.  After she filed for bankruptcy OP would have the opportunity to rescue his mortgage, bring it current and carry on.

We stopped making payments in the great housing crash of 2009 after we both lost our well\nPaying jobs. We stopped around November 2010. The first letter we got was around March 2011. The second letter we got was around June/July 2011 and it was taped to our door. We moved out in July 2011 and left the house sitting there until 2013 when it was finally sold. After talking to about a million different people, if we had brought our mortgage back to current status and paid the back months, everything would of been all good. We didn\u2019t though and did a short sale and actually got money from the bank sent to us by doing a short sale. We couldn\u2019t buy a house for 7 years after all this but we didn\u2019t care because we had moved to a different state and were perfectly fine renting while we figured out where we wanted to live. Anyways, since it seems this guy lives in a different country, I can only imagine that it doesn\u2019t matter as much wherever he lives as much as it does here. They way the US does things is so ass backwards, it makes zero sense. I am still confused how we got money back by agreeing to a short sale, and I\u2019m still confused how we were able to do a short sale because no one else could ever get that far.",

Missing several months of mortgage payments will hit your credit. \n\nI'm confused.\n\nEdit - I see you're not in the US &amp; foreclosures can take a long time. I get that. I don't understand how you got her name off the house w/o buying her share.",

Friend dies a few years later and her POS husband stopped paying the rent and she had to evict him. She sold the property but wasn't able to get enough back to pay off the loan because this was around the time that Obama was in office and the economy had went into a recession. The house and property suddenly was not worth as much as what she paid for it.\n\nLess than a year later her mom suddenly passed away and she lost her flipping mind. After she kicked me out for really stupid reasons I won't go into, I finally gave up trying to fix our marriage and filed for divorce. \n\nAt the time of the divorce, she was trying to sell her house and buy a smaller house so she would not have to mortgage it. My divorce lawyer was instrumental in making sure our divorce agreement spelled out that she owned the house before we ever married, and that I had no claim on the house or any proceeds she got from selling it. \n\nThe agreement also stipulated that she was to keep the house in good order, keep up the mortgage payments until it sold, and that I had the right to come check the house for issues with her escorting me around the house. The last part was the only part she balked on. \n\nAbout two years later I start getting a lot of weird foreclosure prevention type spam emails but didn't think anything of it. It turns out that she was not able to sell the house, she stopped making the mortgage payments and moved out. The mortgage company foreclosed on the house and sold it at auction on the court house steps a few months later. I didn't find out that this had happened until I went to prequalify for a mortgage to buy a home for me and my Girlfriend (now wife) about a year later. \n\nThat divorce agreement was what saved my ass. I wound up having to go with a different mortgage company because the first one pre-qualified me at first, then backed out when I went under contract to buy a house, but I was ultimately able to buy a house. Even with the foreclosure, my credit was still in the mid 700s.",

He didn't say \"I'm going to stop paying and expect no consequences.\"  He simply said he is stopping his payments until he can get his issue resolved. \n\nEventually he cleared it up and brought the mortgage to a good standing.",

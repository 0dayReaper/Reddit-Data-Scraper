    "postText": "I live im a mildly to medium run down apartment complex with a small paved backyard were tenants park their bikes in a wild and uncontrolled manner. \nThe backyard is lined with a couple of garages that can be rented. They\u2018re originally meant for cars, but are only used for storage , because it\u2018s almost impossible to navigate cars into them, due to the shape and size of the backyard. \nOne of the garages was abandonned a couple of years ago and promptly claimed by the cyclists. It\u2018s obviously not a great solution because the only \u201agood\u2018 spots in the garage are front left or front right. The bikes in the back are hard to get to and the ones that are in the front center get pushed over a lot. However the garage spots are the only ones not exposed to rain. Therefore they get piled up in there.\n\nI also park my bicycle in the garage and for the reasons stated above get excited when one of the coveted front side spaces is free. This was the case a couple of weeks ago. Naturally, it tickled me a bit when I found my bike had been moved to the center the next day and another bike was in \u201amy spot\u2018. I put it down to someone moving by bike to get their bike from the back of thebgarage and them not returning my bike to its spot and someone else claiming the now free spot. That\u2018s how things go in the garage. It\u2018s life.\n\nAs you probably guessed by the title, this was not actually a mistake though. I realised this in the following days and weeks when my now enemy\u2019s bike kept appearing in the same spot on the front right wall of the garage. Until then all of us other tenants were just passive aggressively cohabitating. Sure,  now and then a bike got manhandled in the process of freeing another one. But this person was no longer on the defensive, this was person was on the offensive. \n\nI got to test my theory a couple of\nweeks later when they had temporarily vacated their self claimed spot, by parking my bike there. Sure enough, when I came back my bike was moved to the center again and theirs was back in the wall spot.\n\nI find this to be unacceptable. That\u2019s not how you precariously cohabitate, that\u2019s how you start fights. They\u2018re not even reserving \u201atheir\u2018 spot with a towel,  as is famously the manner of my people, at least with sunbeds. No, they are taking this to the next level, luring people in with the sight of a free prime position and then sneakily attacking from the shadows.\n\nWell, well, well, I might be on the short side of short and not so strong but I can lift some bikes if I have a worthwhile cause. And this is it. The thief of the bike spots now finds their bike anywhere but on the front right side of the garage. I make sure that my bike\u2018s nowhere near their spot though, so they don\u2018t suspect me. They are not on to me. \n\nYet.",

    "postText": "(was told this fit here better than r/prorevenge)\n\nI was contacted by an obvious scammer the other day.\n\nThey asked for $160 and I went along with it.\n\nI Got their Cashapp and sent them 1 dollar instead of $160 lulling them into a false belief that they are smart and I am dumb.\n\nThey were all like \"lolol wrong amount but I got the dollar you sent, you can send me $159 and it will still be fine\"\n\nSo I typed in $159 on Cashapp then pressed \"Request\" instead of \"Send\" \n\nPretty sure they didn't read it. They definitely just clicked \"accept\" instead of \"decline\" and I proceeded to block the lowlife scammer $159 richer",

PayPal will give you a negative balance, and you must repay the amount in red. \n\nCashApp is just \"money between friends\" like others have said, and since there is no \"business transaction\", once you send that money, it is gone.

All told, this was about 40-45 minutes of their time.\n\nSo then we get to the point where it comes time to pay and I say \"Great! But I need to go ask mom or dad for their credit card first.\" and I can almost hear the record-scratch of the person's head. \"Uh...isn't this Mazon Del? 23 years old?\" they asked hesitantly. I laughed and said \"Not quite! I'm Mazon, but I'm only 15, I don't even have a car yet. If you hold on a bit though, I just need to tell mom what I'm buying and she'll probably let me do it.\".\n\nThey mumbled an apology about their incorrect information and hung up.\n\nI can only guess they \"updated\" their database concerning my age to mark me as too young to be worth their time because in the ~9 years since then I've never actually gotten another call from them. Though admittedly in the last 4 years I've had Pixel phones with the automated spam-call-interception which works pretty well.",

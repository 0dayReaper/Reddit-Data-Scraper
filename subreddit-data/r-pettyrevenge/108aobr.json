    "postText": "About a decade ago,  I worked an early morning shift at a fast food restaurant. We opened at 6am, so I had to be at work at 5am. \n\nI would leave my house at about 445am every morning. My management was pretty relaxed about the opening shift. Clocking in up to 10 minutes late wasn't really an ordeal, as long as you showed up ready to go. \n\nI came outside at 445 to find that a local police officer has pulled someone over and is now blocking my driveway. \n\nThis has happened before, but normally in the afternoon, and normally I just ask the officer to move forwards or back a couple of feet and then I pull in or out of the driveway. No sweat. \n\nThis officer, however, angrily informs me that I will have to wait till he's done. I snap a picture of his car, text it to my manager and explain my tardiness. \n\n40 minutes later, the police officer FINALLY moves. I scramble into the car and head to work. I get there 15 minutes before we open. I frantically start to brew tea, fetch ice, having to condense my 50 minute routine into 15. I almost forgot to brew coffee. \n\nOpening time rolls around, and the first group of customers come in. It's a group of our local police officers, led by the captain.  I guess they're about to do a shift change.  One of the officers in the group is the one who blocked my driveway. \n\nAnyway, the Captain orders coffee, and I regretfully inform him that there's a five minute wait on coffee because I got to work extremely late. Captain asks why, so I pulled out my phone and explained that one of his officers blocked my driveway for 45 minutes for a routine traffic stop. \n\nCaptain proceeds to chew out that officer in front of all of his colleagues and exclaims that nothing short of a life or death emergency should block my driveway if it will interfere with him getting his morning coffee. \n\nIt was never blocked again. And the Captain always got his coffee at 6am, without interruption.",

One day two young Gardai come in to put in orders for their dress uniforms. They make the stupid decision to be very rude to my Grandad. The reason why this was particularly stupid of them is that all the uniforms have unique number embroidered on the shoulder. So when the superintendent comes who my grandad has been filling orders in for quite some time he mentions the incident with the two young Gardai and superintendent asks if they had picked up their order yet which they hadn't but they were ready to pick up so he takes the number down off both the uniforms and he tells my grandad he will handle it. The next day the superintendent shows back up with a couple of very chewed out looking Gardai who both deliver very sheepish apologies to my grandad for their behavior.",

I think it\u2019s easy to assume a police officer is a self-centered idiot, especially when you see the world through the lens of current events portrayed in the media. But the reality is, like any career field, cops are a microcosm of society. There\u2019s assholes and there\u2019s honest, hardworking people. When I read OP\u2019s story, my first thought was, \u201cThat Captain actually knows how to lead.\u201d Generally, the rule is, \u201cPraise in public. Punish in private\u201d, at least if you want your corrections to be effective. But there are exceptions to the rule and admonishment can be a difficult thing to navigate, but I think the Captain did just fine. As I side note, I would bet good money (at least $3.50) that the Captain has prior military service.",

There is a vehicle blocking my driveway. \n\nWhen I realized it I go outside and I'm aiming toward the person sitting in the truck blocking my driveway and the poor guy is crying his eyes out. I'm fixing to give him a what for because I'm late for work.  And in nowaday time I'm going to lose Christmas bonus points because I'm late for work.(not then).\n\nSo I'm late for work and I go outside and I tell them I have to take photographic proof that I can't get out of my driveway. And just as I'm about to confront the guy and the vehicle in front of my driveway the police officer calls me over and says don't lecture him, his wife cheated on him. What guy did was peel out of his driveway and drop his rear axle and block my driveway and couldn't leave.  Now I'm left being late for work and losing a Christmas bonus because of some woman f****** around on her husband and him having a wild-ass ride escaping her fierceness. \n\nF*** that s***",

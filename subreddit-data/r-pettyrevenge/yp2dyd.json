    "postText": "His long distance girlfriend is moving in in December from overseas and because my father is a liar, she falsely believes that my room was used by his ex and that she had since moved out (the truth is that they were sharing his bed until last week while I lived in the other room.) And so, to keep up the ruse, he told me yesterday that I had two weeks to clear out my room, take my belongings and leave no trace of my existence behind in the apartment. \n\nHis girlfriend is apparently a clean freak and my dad is desperate to make a good impression. Hence me getting kicked out. So right before I leave there's going to be an \"accidental\" spill of tuna juice on the living room rug and there will be honey and sugar in inconspicuous corners.... I think the ants will love it. Hopefully the tuna juice will go bad and make the whole place slowly stink over the course of several weeks for no reason and hopefully my dad will be embarrassed and miserable.\n\n\nEdit: I am a broke college student. I pay for my studies myself. My dad was a cheating deadbeat growing up. We had a deal that I could move in with him and stay until I graduate. **No, I can't tell his girlfriend without putting my physical safety on the line, even secret attempts.** Otherwise I 100% would, I think what he's doing is awful. My father is purging the apartment and my room when I'm gone **so anything for her to \"find\" wouldn't work** nor would something that stinks immediately. Yes, my dad's a dick, it's a long established fact.\n\nEdit 2: some of you guys don't seem to remember what subreddit we're on? Yes I'm being petty, that's sort of *the point*.\n\nEdit 3: added some precisions in edit 1. Also- thank you for the outpouring of support and ideas. You guys are diabolical and made me cackle. Makes me feel better about the shitty situation I'm in. I'll definitely try to post an update.\n\nEdit 4: I posted an update [here! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/zn15oo/update_my_dad_is_kicking_me_out_im_leaving_a_gift/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) Thanks for the support :)",

Nothing recognizable or cloying. Just a hint of something expensive, elusive, left behind by fabric sliding over and pressed against silky smooth skin. \n\n*Go into a department store or a Ulta/Sephora\u2014ask for some lotion samples\u2026something elegant for your aunt.*   Go home, shower with basic soap, no competing scent. Rub some of the lotion in the small of your back. Tuck the underwear in a smooth inside-out shape. Put it against the lotioned area. Now pull a t-shirt over that and just sit somewhere, relaxed, clean, letting that femme fatale scent permeate that underwear via body warmth. Every woman alive knows that scent transfer. \n\nYour dad will be alibi-less. \n\nJust obviously freshly worn new nice panties? Standard petty revenge. \n\nBut the lovely scanties that could only have been worn by a woman more your dad\u2019s age, who was comfortable enough to wear her everyday dainty things in the bed, those must have been worn there *on a regular basis*. \n\nThis is elevated petty revenge, stiletto-grade, painful twist, stage one.\n\nEdit: punctuation",

People helped carry my gifts to my car, and said friend carried his gift straight from his car to mine. I wasn't aware that the Styrofoam box on my back seat was full of shrimp on ice. I thought it was the cooler that my birthday cake came in.\n\nI was exhausted when I got home, so I just unloaded my car and set everything in my front room, which is *carpeted.*\n\nIt was several days before I got around to sorting through the things because I'd been very busy.  I picked up the Styrofoam box to carry it to the garage, and I immediately started gagging.  For some reason, it never smelled until I picked up the cooler.  Since it was just Styrofoam, the shrimp-flavored ice melted and seeped into my carpet.  \n\nI used everything I knew to try to get the smell out. I considered burning down the house.  It finally went away after a week.  Lesson learned.",

She worked in a bar so had crazy hours, but also for some reason decided it would be ok if her boyfriend moved in full-time (it was 9 people in a shared house with a common kitchen and not even a living room, so not exactly room for an extra person). She was also the person who had a pet, a little bunny. Oh, and with a few months left, they bought a puppy! It was some kind of large breed that tripled in size in just a few months. And they were never home to walk it since they worked together at the bar, so it peed and shit everywhere, and only ever got walked when one of us took it out of pity. At one point, someone snuck into their room to investigate a smell (we often cleared out leftover bar food that would sit for days) and found the dog had pissed all over their sheets\u2026in the remaining month we lived together, they never washed it out.\n\nSo after all this, they move out a few days before our lease is up, without telling anyone, leaving behind all their stuff in a disaster. Since we\u2019re all broke students, we decide it\u2019s worth the effort to try to clean it, since we can\u2019t afford to lose our deposit. We start cleaning but there\u2019s a smell we just can\u2019t get rid of. After a lot of investigation, it turns out that every time they would clean their bunnies cage, they were so goddamn lazy that they wouldn\u2019t walk the bag to a garbage can, but they were stuffing into any place they could find - there were dozens of bags hidden under the floorboards, stuck inside the panel of the walls. They were pulling the baseboards back and sticking a bag of poop in there.\n\nSo yeah, animal piss is definitely the way to go. Hard to trace it to you chronologically because it\u2019s something that gets worse slowly over time and you could pretend you had just been getting used to it.",

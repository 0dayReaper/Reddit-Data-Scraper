    "postText": "I work in tech repair and am currently very pleased with myself for the pettiness I just displayed. We open at noon on Sundays. A customer came in right at noon with a certain phone that, due to several hoops we have to jump through to make the manufacturer happy (a long series of tests and checks we have to run post-repair), our standard time quote is 2 hours. That being said, for the past few months, we've been so busy and short staffed that we typically tell people 3-4 hours for them. But 2 is the \"absolute\" minimum for getting the repair done and all the testing in a realistic time frame. \n\nSo, I'm sitting in back when my tech that's checking people in rushes back with this guy's phone to put it right on the heat, even though there are still people up front. When I give him a quizzical look, he informs me that the guy has stated that he must have his phone fixed by 1:30p. Which...is not two hours. What bothers me more however is how clearly stressed out he has made my tech, who knows better than to agree to that without checking, so must have been pretty intimidated to just accept it. And now my tech feels like, since he made the dumb promise, he has to take on the repair despite being the newest employee that we have on staff, who we still expect to work slow and steady and pause to ask questions. (No rushing allowed for newbies!) \n\nSo, I grab the phone, cuz I'm not gonna have this kid worrying about it. And I can, if I concentrate, and if there aren't any road bumps (a BIG if) get it done in time. Meanwhile, the customer stands in our lobby for the ENTIRE REPAIR. We do have a couple chairs available for the very rare moment people choose to wait in store. He did not utilize the chairs. Instead, he hovered. And, at one point, decided to grab our front desk phone and make a call, without asking and confusing the heck out of us in the back room. (\"Why is line 1 in use? Did you forget to hang up?\" \"No...did you?\" \"No...who the heck is...ohhhhhhh.\")\n\nSo I'm getting to the end of my testing and notice that it's about 1:20p. And the guy is still aggressively hovering. So I decide to be the pettiest petty I can petty on this fine Sunday. \n\nAnd I dragged my feet just a hair. Just a tad. \n\nAnd I marked his device as completed at precisely 1:31p. \ud83e\udd23",

People would come in, place an order, usually for business cards, and expect them the next day. \n\nSo in my most pleasant voice, I would ask if they wanted this to be a rush order. If they said yes, I would quote their job with an extra 50 bucks tacked on. They wanted to know why it was costing them an extra 50 bucks. \n\nAnd in the sweetest voice I could muster, I would reply, \"Yours is a rush job, which means the other 15 orders ahead of you will be put aside so we can do yours instead.\" They would get adamant and say they were not paying an extra 50 bucks for 500 business cards. \n\nAnd my reply, \"Okay, not a rush order, they will be done in 5-7 business days, is there a number we can reach you when they are done?\" \n\nI eventually put a sign on the front counter that read \"If you want it tomorrow, you should have come in last week. All rush orders will have an extra $50 rush fee added.\"",

I cannot tell you how much fun it is to watch the baffled looks on people's faces when they're offering to pay extra for a rush and I tell them \"Sorry, that's against our policies and wouldn't be fair to the others who have been waiting for several days already.\" They can never quite comprehend that their money will not buy their way to the front of the line. \n\nNote: We only do phones as same day repairs, and phones are ALWAYS same day, unless there are complications or they come in after the cut-off. All other devices are on a sliding scale of length depending on how busy we are. Sometimes we'll get to it tomorrow, sometimes it'll be two weeks.

I asked them if they could just save the spot and I would bring it in on the day they could actually work on it. At home, i had a college aged kid who had been fighting her brains tendency towards contamination OCD during 2019 (been sick all thru HS, which had prob pushed her that way). Covid was just all her fears come true and that lamp being out of the house and the germs it could bring back was going to push her over yet another edge (we were nowhere near vaccines yet). I had taken it out while she was asleep to see if it could be fixed at all. I explained some of this to the clerk, who said wait a minute... went to talk to her two techs....bless their hearts, they said can you give us 20 min, dropped what they were doing and worked on it together and gave it back to me in 15 min. I cried all the way home.\ud83d\udc96",

A friend found one on Amazon, and recommended he look into it.  We ordered in a couple of them, and they were pretty neat arrays of emitters in a cylinder shape.  However, further research showed that in order to keep Covid 19 under control, it would require the lamp to emit UV-C level wavelengths in order to be effective.  UV-C would create stupid amounts of ozone over time that would have to be filtered to be removed, and this certainly complicated the situation. In his tests, the lamp, which was sold as capable of dealing death to viruses was found to be very bright, but nowhere near the wavelength it needed to be to be effective.  In essence, it was a pretty black light.  The unit was sold out of China, and he returned one of the two for a refund. The other I kept so I could take it apart and turn it to other nefarious purposes.  After his conclusions, I called up Amazon and had a long talk with them about the false advertising of the lamps.  They weren't cheap, and they wouldn't protect anyone from Covid.  Viruses are evil and quite different from bacteria, and I told the rep what it would take to scrub a virus using UV light.  I was concerned that someone would place their trust in a bogus device like the lamp, only to find that it was the cause of someone not escaping a viral death. Amazon agreed, and the lamps were taken down until the seller changed the ad copy, removing claims of killing Covid or other viruses.  As it turns out, almost none of the lamps out on the market emit UV-C since some significant danger exists in using them. So the end of this side-story is, get the vaccine.  It's well past the testing phase, and has proven very effective at saving lives.  You may still get the virus, but it cuts the suffering down by more than half, and also important, Covid causes permanent physical damage if not managed. Taste is a big one for loss, as is physical strength, lung function, and brain clarity.  I've had Covid, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy; even it's vaccine-reduced level is potent and took a long time to get over.  It is definitely nastier than the flu.  The flu vaccine can stop the flu, but the Covid vaccine can only lessen the severity of the infection. The alternative would be to try fighting it off with no protections at all, and that could be a fatal end.  If you read this missive all the way to the end, you now know enough to read the specs on any lamp that makes claims about viruses.  If it's not UV-C, it's much lower power, and can't kill Covid.  This side story is now ended.",

If it's a complete mystery \"my phone doesn't work and I don't know why\", that's when you're looking at more than a day for a phone. Our system is set up so phones get done same day when possible, even if we have a bunch of other stuff in line (computers, consoles, tablets, all the other random stuff) because those things are almost always going to be a multi-day process anyways so another couple hour delay won't affect them. \n\nI wish everyone had your attitude though!!

    "postText": "My dickhead ex and I broke up around 5 years ago. He was a disgusting man child and sadly my naive (then) 20 year old brain didn\u2019t know any better than him. \n\nI tried hard to make it work as it was my first serious relationship. He SA\u2019d me repeatedly when I was sleeping, when he was wasted. He was always drunk. Everyone thought the sun shone from his fat arse and he could do no wrong. I finally had enough of his gaslighting and abuse so kicked him the fuck out. \nHe kept his key to my house so he could come and get his things while I was supposed to be at work, but would just let himself in while I was getting ready in the mornings, or going to bed at night. He was a complete worm, and totally hopeless. I could go on all night. \n\nAnyway, when I finally had enough of telling him he still had stuff at my house, I just said \u201cok I guess you\u2019ve got all you need so I\u2019ll deal with what\u2019s left.\u201d \nI then started getting phone calls from debt collectors for things he hadn\u2019t paid for. That was the final straw. \nHe\u2019d left some sentimental things at mine, so in an attempt to be graceful, I boxed them up and had said to let me know when he wanted to come and collect them, since I\u2019d changed the locks. One item was his pathetic toy gorilla he\u2019d had as a kid. Honestly it turned my stomach that someone knocking on 30 still spoke about that shitty thing in a baby voice and made out it was the most precious item in the world. \n\nI binned all his shit he was too lazy to collect and I took immense joy in letting my dog rip that ugly toy to shreds in minutes. He tore it instantly and I felt the thrill emanating through Charlie\u2019s strong jaws, deep into my bones. \n\nThe stupid fucker asked me where it was months later. I simply replied \u201csorry, no idea. You must\u2019ve taken it\u201d \nFuck you, over and out.",

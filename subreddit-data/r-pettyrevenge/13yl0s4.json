    "postText": "My team works in a first in first out workflow doing the oldest work first. One of my teammates seems to cherry pick work by looking to see if there are notes on another system to indicate the issues  are easy before assigning them to herself. Since the work doesn't cycle in by date order its easy for the management to overlook this however as a team member who seems to get all the crap issues its easy to see the pattern.\n\nSo this week I started putting notes in the other system to make them look easy and since that's what lazy member looks for she took a huge amount of work for herself. Then I went into the other system and wiped out my notes like they were never there. \n\nQue the whining about how difficult her week is. She can't give anything back because the sharepoint stamps the date/time/id of person who modified an issue so everyone would know what's going on. And she can't complain about the disappearing notes since there's no way to prove they were ever there and you aren't suppose to be looking at them before assigning your work. \n\nBeing so extremely petty I'll not touch any of the notes for the next few weeks and once she goes back to her old habit I'll just do it again.",

I removed any incentives based on number of calls closed and required them to take the oldest call. \n\nI also had a two tier support structure. They were all pretty senior so they did duty at both levels. They were to work the call for 10 minutes and determine whether it could be closed quickly or needed significantly more time. At the end of 10 minutes they had to pass the call to the second level who worked the call to completion. If no one was available, the customer received a call back.\n\nUsing this approach, were able to quickly address the easy calls while making sure that the hard ones, or troublesome customer ones, were all addressed.",

Her entire job was like maybe an extra 5-10% of what I normally did in a day. And any time we'd ask her to help when the rest of us were swamped, she'd have some kind of excuse about how she was too busy, take like a 4-hour lunch, or just flat out ignore us... sometimes even the manager. I'm literally not kidding when I say she basically just spent her days watching soap operas on her work computer. \n\nWhile it would have been awesome if you somehow managed to be part of my old group, and this was done to the person I'm thinking of, I can at least take some enjoyment in it being a blow against people of a certain type.",

She didn't even do that, and there were times when the manager would tell her to help out and she just ignored him too.\n\nOn the plus side, I got that job largely because she wouldn't pick up any slack and everyone else needed help.

She was supposed to train me when I started but it was clear she had no clue how to do the work and was using me to get the easy work. \"He isn't ready for hard work yet, he needs the easy stuff still!\". It worked out well for me because I got a permanent position with a large raise and she's still plugging along trying to avoid the hard work.",

Basically 8am ET to 6pm PT (US east to west).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI worked 10-7, others started at 5am, 6am &amp; 8am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring 1-on-1s, our manager was always bringing up that I did 1/3 the tickets of everyone else.  Odd, because I was always working tickets and playing clean-up of the queues at the end of the day.\n\nI started looking at my tickets vs everyone else.   I noticed they were grabbing newer tickets over older ones.  With many of the older ones still being in queue when I'd start work.   Then I noticed newer easy tickets being taken over older tough ones, even when I was on shift.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't care.  The tougher tickets were more satisfying.  20 tickets for reset a users access, yawn.\n\nNever convinced our manager that I was doing as much work, as she had come from a manufacturing background.   Yes, how many cans of mixed fruit did we produce today.   So she was pure numbers vs real work accomplished.",

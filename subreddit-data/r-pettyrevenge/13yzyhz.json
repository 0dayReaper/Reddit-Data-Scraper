    "postText": " I always did the maintenance on our Exploder, over the years I purchased thousands of dollars on lifetime parts.. brakes, radiator, alternator\u2026. ect. at the Zone.. Shortly before my world imploded and I found myself divorced, my poor Sploder was totaled.. Fast forward a\nfew months. I see that she has, a new to her, same\nmake and model\u2026 when she listed all the stuff it needed.. calipers, radiator.. you know almost all of the lifetime parts I had replaced on our old one\u2026 Soo I informed the Zone that the vehicle associated with those parts was destroyed. Boy was she pissed when she found out that the Zone wouldn\u2019t honor the lifetime warranty for the same parts on a different vehicle\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

If the part numbers or brand of the parts didn't match what you purchased there was no way we would have swapped them out. The only thing she might have gotten away with was some brake pads since they don't always have part numbers on it. \n\nThat being said, good on you to screw over an old exploder with her new Exploder.",

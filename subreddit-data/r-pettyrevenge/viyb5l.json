    "postText": "# I don't care if you are from fox or bored panda or buzzfeed or whatever paper . No I won't give you an \"exclusive interview\". This is not even news worthy. Wtf kind of journalism is that supposed to be?#\n\n\n\n----------------------\n\n**After 39 messages in my inbox, asking me to post here, I will!**\n\n\nMy halfsister \"heather\" and I never really got along. We both are 24. My father left my mother for her mother and we were born the same month 20 days appart. It has always been weird.\n\nIt doesn't help that Heather's mom hates me and my mom. By extention Heather and I didn't have the best relationship.\n\nShe has always tried to one up me. Even tho we both have a similar economic background. I ca n give examples of this but for the sake of the world limit won't write them here.\n\nSo now my fianc\u00e9 and I got engaged last month and had our engagement party this Saturday.\nWe had planned it originally as a casual- formal event. Nice dresses but not \"I am going to the met gala ball\" nice. More like \"we are going to a good restaurant\" nice.\n\nAnyway my cousin hits me up saying she has to show me something. It was the picture of the dress Heather was gonna wear.\n\n**[Edit: this is what the dress looked like approximately. It was a bit shorter and a bit less puffy. The rest is almost identical ](http://picture-cdn.wheretoget.it/fhiz24-i.jpg)**\n\nThis dress.... Jesus christ. It can only be described as opulent. It was long and white. Strapless with sewn in \"Chrystals\" and golden accents. I'm pretty sure it's a wedding dress but I can't be 100 percent.\n\nThis made me really mad. So I decided.... fuck that. I started texting people telling them that there had been a change of plans. And that instead of casual formal I decided to make a costume party. My mother's side is crazy for Halloween so they were immediately on board. I told my father via text, and asked for him to rely the message to Heather  her mother. Knowing full well that he would forget or leave it to the last minute.\n\nSaturday comes along. Guests start showing up. Most of them in costumes. Some didn't have time to get one. We just provided them with fun hats and cheap wigs.\n\nHeather my dad and her mother come like one hour late.\n\nAs soon as she notices that everyone was either wearing elaborate costumes or weird accessories and she didn't  stand out she lost it. Especially when my fiance came along and told her that \"her bride dress looked amazing for a cheap costume\".\n\nShe left crying and her mother and my father told me that I was being childish and I could have told Heather myself and not have tasked my father.\n\nFor those interested: My fiance was dressed as bubbles and I was dressed as mojojojo. My mom and aunts went as ABBA. Other memorable costumes were: luffy and Zorro, Ian Malcom and John Hammond and Jesus\n\n**edit** : \n\n*so why did I invite her?*\n\nIt's one of those weird family situations where not inviting them would have been more dramatic. You know when you try pleasing everyone. Plus I still wanted a relationship with my father, so not inviting Heather and her mom would have made things super difficult and made it so my father would have had to choose. \n\nWhen I kept thinking of it, I noticed that my father wouldn't have chosen me on this scenario. Which is why I ended up cutting them off.\n\n\n*You let her win.*\n\nNo. The point of this is to ruin my half sister's intention. She wasn't just \"dressed nicely\" as some of you put it. She wore a **wedding** dress to my **engagement** party. I'd much rather subvert this whole mess rather than have her smugly sitting at the table with her wedding dress.\n\nAlso some of you are really hung up on the \"cheap wigs part\" and ignore literally everything else regarding the party. A minority of our guests wore those cheap wigs. Also it literally doesn't matter. We had a blast. After she left i didn't even think of her again till a few days later. I don't regret the costume party. I wish I thought of it earlier tbh.\n\n*this is a karma whoring repost!!!!!!*\n\nNo it isn't. I posted this story before on aita. I just had to wait 2 weeks to post on here.\n\nAlso I can't believe I have go say this. But the lady on the picture is not Heather. It's also not the dress she wore. I looked for a picture that looked approximately like the dress",

Most of the guests, with the exception of my husband's brother and sister &amp; spouses were in full renfaire garb. The groom went striding down the aisle preceded by a boy waving a pirate flag and with his entire crew around them, two of them dragging along the reluctant officiant. \n\nThey were met by my husband, daughter's 10-year-old son, and me, all in full Cossack garb. Groom paid us the agreed bride price. A chest full of \"gold\" and \"jewels\" to prove that he could support our daughter; also three cows and a goat. (The cows were small stuffed cows carried by the smallest children in the family, the goat was a donation in our name to Project Heifer.)\n\nWe then presented him with a dower chest full of dressmaker equipment and supplies, so that our daughter could support herself should he not come home from one of his sea voyages. (She is a semi-professional custom tailor.) \n\nHe then asked one of the crew to bring out his bride. Crewman returned with bridesmaid #1. Wrong bride. Crewman #2 was dispatched, returning with two more bridesmaids, dragged along by the scruff of their necks.  \"Is she one of these, Boss?\" The groom turned to his brother, the best man. \"My brother, I know I can trust you to fetch my bride!\"\n  \nBrother returns with the matron of honor. Groom: \"We're getting closer. This is her sister. *Can no one fetch me my bride?!?*\"\n\nBride's son pipes up. \"I will!\" Ran off and escorted his mother out. Vows were said that they composed themselves. Cheers were cheered. \n\nThe feast commenced. Whole pig that had been roasting since 6am. 24 pounds of chocolate covered strawberries, of which the bride got 2 berries. Other weddingy stuff. Mead. Beer. Wine.  Cake shaped like a treasure chest. Belly dancing. Singing Pirates. 80 people in my back yard, not counting the singing pirates. \n\nIt was great!",

My husband and his attendants were all in black leather pants and billowy white pirate/poet shirts. My attendants wore matching Renaissance-style skirts and blouses with a corsetlike vest. My dad dressed as Merlin the Magician (after changing from his Boston Celtics basketball costume - God, I miss him and his hilariously weird humor.) There were fairies and pixies and angels with red feather wings. And, fire dancers performed after a sit-down feast. It was an absolute blast and so many people told us it was the most fun wedding they'd ever attended.",

Children throw fits because their brains literally can't process and accept what's happening, and it carries over to adulthood if it's never addressed (which is one of the saddest things to witness... I feel for OP).\n\nYou have to actually have a thoughtful conversation so they understand and learn how to regulate and reason with their emotions on their own. But for some reason many parents don't have the capacity to explain \"hey think about this for a second, this is your brother's special day, it comes once a year just like your special day. You wouldn't want him to act out at your birthday, so why are you doing that to him? That's called being a hypocrite. We treat each other with fairness and respect in this family, because that's how we want to be treated ourselves. So think about how you behave during your brother's birthday, because that's how we're all going to behave at yours.\" Lol maybe not that specifically, but being subjected to appropriate consequences is part of the learning process for sure. It just doesn't work if the parents have to be taught this concept themselves \u0ca0_\u0ca0",

It feels a lot more peaceful but it is sad that my family sucks so much. They can't even keep their bullshit to themselves themselves even though I'm 1500 miles away. They started messaging my MIL, husband etc about petty bullshit.. whatever they're mad about that day. They're embarrassing. The worst was when my dad was in jail for domestic violence last year and as soon as he gets out he texts my MIL how he's done with my mom etc it was honestly a psycho message. She was super uncomfortable but still talked to him because she figured maybe he had no one else to talk to. Her husband, my husband's stepfather, was pissed at my dad. He was like why is he texting texting wife this shit. I was like idk I'm so sorry. BTW my parents got back together in like 2 weeks after that incident. As per usual. I just wish they'd shut up and keep this shit to themselves. After 28 years of living with them or close to them I'm so numb to it I don't care what they do and I don't wanna hear about it. I'm low contact with both of them.\n\nI don't even speak to my sister. I'm the most sad about that but she is an extremely toxic person who just wants to hurt others as much as she can. She is the product of my parents shitty upbringing but she refuses to get help for her out of control emotions and anger. She has physically abused me as well as mentally and the sad part is she thinks it's normal bc that's how my family was growing up. \n\nSo yeah it is sad that they're like this but honestly being across the country is for the best. Especially since I have kids. I don't want them growing up thinking yelling, name-calling and physical abuse is normal. Smfh. Solidarity.",

So to keep it simple, I had decided to just make the shower in her colors. Well after our mom driving us nuts with complaints how what we\u2019re gonna do is going to look tacky or that we didn\u2019t even care, etc. Sis said the magic words our nerdy ass friends all agreed to. Long story short, we told everyone but her that we would be dressing up in our Renaissance Faire gear. We ended up making flower crowns for guests who didn\u2019t want to dress up but still have fun with it. We also made the ice ring for the punch bowl in the shape of a dragon curled around its eggs. \n\nShe\u2019d also gotten pissed she didn\u2019t get an invite, I\u2019d tried to tell her it\u2019s cause she was part of the planning, and she said if she doesn\u2019t receive her invite, she\u2019s not coming and neither is my grandma. Mom we could\u2019ve called her bluff, but pulling our grandma into it was a low blow and we weren\u2019t risking that. So for the week leading up to the shower, I sent her a shower invite from all the extras. Each addressed slightly differently with her name, including misspellings.",

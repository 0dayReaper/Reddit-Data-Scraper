    "postText": "A few years ago, My family, wife and kids went to a new country for a couple weeks, and had booked a rather nice airbnb. It cost $4000 for two weeks, so it better be nice. Anyhow, we were offered the services of the house keeper at $20 a day, after three days,  I decided to call her, and have her come, but right away, I got a weird feeling from her, so I told her just to clean for a couple hours, and I would pay her for the whole day. I didn't want her in the house when we weren't there. \n\nWhile that ticked her off so she told the owners we had ruined the place, and caused a bunch of damage. They immediatly emailed me and said we needed to get out, and they were calling the cops on us, and weren't refunding us. \n\nFeeling vulnerable in another country with a family to protect isn't a fun situation, but luckily we secured a motel nearby (major downgrade, but had availability). \n\nAfter arguing back and forth with the owner via email, I told the host we wouldn't leave, and they would have to get the cops to come unless someone came and brought me a cash refund. So lo and behold a property manager shows up (actually ended up being my neighbour a few months later) and walks through the property. He can't find anything wrong with it, calls up the owners and has a big argument with them. Pays me the refund and then cancels the owners as a client. He said he had never seen someone so crazy as these owners. \n\nSo where is the petty revenge??? While what the property manager didn't know is that I left a bunch of sausages in the toilet tanks, so by the time the owners come back, Im pretty sure the place will stink to high heaven. \n\nSmall Victories.",

I try to pop in mid week so as to not interrupt their weekend, and sometimes they are present. Some offer to go out to the patio or lake when I get there, which I tell them whatever makes them more comfortable- I can work around them, and aside from the sound of the vacuum they won\u2019t even know I\u2019m there. More often than not I\u2019ll let them know I\u2019m there and then start with the second house (which is usually empty during the week) so they have time to like, prepare for me? Like if they forget I\u2019m coming and people are showering, or they\u2019re having lunch or whatever I give them that time to finish up whatever before a stranger impedes on them. I also offer to come back when it\u2019s more convenient for them, if they so wish. I\u2019m super flexible, and live less than 5 minutes away, plus they pay me, so whatever they want lol. \n\nDid I read that correctly- 20$/day for cleaning?! Like I don\u2019t know which country you traveled to or when, but that low price for the cleaner seems to be a carrot on a stick to get you to hire them and get them in there in the first place. I\u2019ve been in housekeeping of some form for decades and that\u2019s an absurdly low price if you\u2019re paying it directly to the cleaner. Of course, maybe it\u2019s just an add of fee to help pay whatever the owner is paying them which could be more than that, but that\u2019d be kind of strange. Nah, really strange. I was thinking if the instance of one place that charges X amount for their cleaning fee to customers, but pays me like 30$ more than that. They\u2019re definitely an outlier for this sort of situation, and I\u2019ve never had another client pay me more than what they were making in the first place but  it does happen! \n\nAll that said, your situation feels sketch AF. The cleaner and owner were up to some sort of scam/theft bullshit.",

Those hotel room mini safes are useless, they have a limited number of master combinations \\[won't swear to it, but something like 25 for the major brand that is in the brand hotel that I stayed at every month for almost 3 years for a weekend. Got to know the night manager and she and I would talk\\]\n\nHonestly, I will never Air BNB, nor will I run an air bnb, I just dislike there being so many reports of shady crap now happening \\[apparently the first year or so they were pretty cool\\] Ditto lyft/uber, I mean I had to medical-uber for about 6 months once a week \\[yay pain meds?\\] and I stopped earlier than I should have because the last 4 times \\[1 month\\] I got the same guy every time, and he would \\*wait\\* in the parking lot at the hospital for me to get done \\[I didn't ask him to, I just noticed him when I looked out the window of the infusion clinic and I saw him there, and it was not lunch or anything\\] and he started calling me by name, and he knew my chemo schedule, and commented about my being alone all the time and never discussing 'my husband' as if I would chat with a total stranger about something I might be doing with y husband or going on a date or something",

She then cleaned up the kitchen and left.\n\nWhen the husband returned with his new girlfriend, all was bliss for the first few days. Then slowly, the house began to smell. They tried everything cleaning, mopping and airing the place out.\n\nVents were checked for dead rodents and carpets were steam cleaned.\n\nAir fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to set off gas canisters, during which they had to move out for a few days, and in the end they even paid to replace the expensive wool carpeting.\n\nNothing worked. People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen refused to work in the house. The maid quit.\n\nFinally, they could not take the stench any longer and decided to move.\n\nA month later, even though they had cut their price in half, they could not find a buyer for their stinky house. Word got out and eventually even the local Realtors refused to return their calls.\n\nFinally, they had to borrow a huge sum of money from the bank to purchase a new place.\n\nThe ex-wife called the man and asked how things were going. He told her the saga of the rotting house. She listened politely and said that she missed her old home terribly, and would be willing to reduce her divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house back.\n\nKnowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell was, he agreed on a price that was about 1/10th of what the house had been worth, but only if she were to sign the papers that very day.\n\nShe agreed and within the hour his lawyers delivered the paperwork.\n\nA week later the man and his girlfriend stood smiling as they watched the moving company pack everything to take to their new home......Including the curtain rods.",

There's no bulk to them to hold moisture and allow them to rot.  So it'll be vaguely fishy scented for a couple of days ad then the smell just vanishes.\n\nSausages in the toilet tank is great!  That'll be a horrific stinking soup in three days and there will be maggots in about five days.  And with any luck, someone will try to reflexively flush the toilet, thinking the smell is somehow coming from the drain and the smell will get a thousand times worse as that sludge is spun around the bowl and throw into the air.",

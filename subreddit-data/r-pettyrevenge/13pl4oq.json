    "postText": "So..... A few years ago I worked as a \"Private Hire\" taxi driver in my country. Basically, I was working taxi without a license and you use your own personal vehicle, (Station Wagon/SUV, etc), but it's usually overlooked as long you don't cause trouble/cause an accident. \n\nAnyway, it's not uncommon for people regular hire us for special jobs and some drivers would have multiple people as clients. Well I had this one woman who had hired me before call up and ask me to drop her to the next town over and pick her back up later. I agreed and decided to go. So I arrived at her place and wait .... And wait.... And wait some more. I did call her but she would only say she was coming, but still nothing. Finally after over an hour she finally came out with her kids. I am pissed she didn't say anything about her kids coming with her, but say nothing and we head off. I have nothing against kids to begin with I figure more money in the end.\n\n By this time, it began to rain and I mean serious rain. Complete white out/flood causing kind of rain and the route I had to take was through some hills with ALOT of blind bends. But for some reason, the woman thought I was being dumb for being cautious by blowing my horn and taking my time at each horn. Again I say nothing and eventually we reach the town. But then she told me to take a couple turns to an area I was not familiar with and I saw a street sign marked \"St. B.\" It's when I realize this chick took me to one of the more  notorious placed in my area. As St B was a place most drivers avoid because it was a place taxi drivers get robbed or worse. \n\n But anyway we arrive and I tell her the fee. To which the chick starts to yell saying it was too much would only pay half. Cause apparently making me wait for her for over an hour and being conned into going into a high crime area in a rain storm was only worth less than half than what I was owed. Worse still she wanted me to come back to said high crime area after dark to pick her up. Meaning she would have to walk out of said bad area at night before she could get another taxi.\n\nAgain I say nothing and take the money she gives me before leaving. Later that evening she calls back and again.... I say nothing. In fact I don't even answer the phone and eventually block her number. But this is not the end... As she calls me a few days later from another number and she has the gaul the try and hire me again. \n\nI tell her \"No\" and hire someone else\" before hanging up and blocking her again.  But I was not done. \n\n I then began to warn other drivers about her and how she liked to short pay. Needless to say, I doubt she would get anyone to drive her anywhere again for a while.\n\nAs for me, I actually got another client the very same day who would hire me regularly and pay very well each time. So at least things worked out for me in the end.\n\nWord to the wise... Don't try to screw over your only ride.",

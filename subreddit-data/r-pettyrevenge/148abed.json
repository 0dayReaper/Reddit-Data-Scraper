    "postText": "There is this guy who works on another production line, he can't do his job the line is always backed up he's been here longer than me and I know more tricks than he does to deal with a backed up line. For example pull out a few skids of product and put them on the floor then run the next skid on the line, keep doing that until your partner returns from break. \n\nNo body in warehouse likes him because he talks shit about everyone behind their backs he was called out on it once last year and he broke out crying. I happened to hear through the grape vine that he's been making fun of my wide forehead, which is fine I like a good joke from time to time but he had to push it to far and said that with my forehead I could be jeffrey epstein jr.\n\nI wasn't gonna let that slide not one bit, so for that past 2 months I haven't been helping him, his line gets backed up not my problem, there is a big mess in his machine, not my problem, oh your talking to me? Ignore him cold turkey. His numbers are going down so much I'm betting they give him the boot before the year is out.",

    "postText": "Context: I've (20F) been bullied all my life and have been in recovery for a multitude of things for the past year or so. \nI go to University in the same city I grew up in so there's a high chance of me coming across people went to previous schools or who hurt/bullied me. I was well known for being bad tempered and easy to wind up, when I was younger.\n\nWhat happened: I was in the pharmacy waiting to pick up my prescription when someone shouted something at me. I pretended to not hear them and they shouted again. They ended up getting frustrated and tugging on my arm. I twisted around and immediately recognised who it was- a guy (20M) who had bullied me for over 10 years. So rather than get angry I thought I would mess with him and see what happens\n\nHim: hi, heard you were in [local uni]\nMe: I'm sorry but I don't know who you are, do I know you from somewhere\n\nImmediately he deflated. It was glorious to see, I had to stop myself from smiling.\n\nHim: it's me, [his name], from school. Come on you know me.\nMe, with a confused face, acting 100: I'm really sorry but I don't know you. Did we go swimming together perhaps?\nHim: .....no I don't think so\nMe: I'm really sorry but I just don't know who you are. I think you should go to the back of the line sir.\n\nI went on my phone and just blocked him out. He looked lost and eventually went to the back of the line. I got my prescription, ignored him and went to my car and drove off. I literally screamed for joy and also because I was about to break down. \nIt was a wonderful feeling, to see him like that and to feel like he had nothing against me. To make him feel like he hadn't had a large effect on my life.\n\nEdit: I'm amazed so many people've read this seeing as I wrote this in 5 minutes in an ASDA car park.\nTo the people who think he was about to be nice or that I bullied him, I have to disagree: he was never nice to me, and would love to pretend to be nice and then pull the rug. Nothing I could do would be half as worse as what he's done to me. I don't owe him anything.\n\nHi again edit: thank you all for the love and awards, it means a lot &lt;3. And I just want to clarify that he didn't shout my name but said \"oi ginger\" and that he was probably gonna make fun of the fact I'm going to the local uni and not a 'better one'.",

If they really grew up, they\u2019d own up to what they\u2019ve done, not be a coward and try and pretend like nothing is wrong or try to butter you up later in life to make their ego feel better. \n\nAlso the \u201cI was just a kid\u201d argument is utter bullshit. I don\u2019t give a fuck if you\u2019re a kid, if you\u2019re going to *threaten or attempt to perminanlty disfigure someones face with glass* or bully a child so severely they take their own life, you did your growing up in that moment because that\u2019s a damn grown up decision to make.\n\nChildren have concepts of empathy, and understand right from wrong. A child may not have a fully developed sense of either of these, but children that are in middle school understand that telling someone to kill themselves and that you hope they die is wrong and that it\u2019s going to hurt that person. There comes a point in which \u201cthey\u2019re a kid\u201d isn\u2019t a valid excuse anymore. If you\u2019re a kid (12+) and you\u2019re bullying someone like that, sorry you\u2019re just a piece of shit human being and it\u2019s not growing up that will change you, it\u2019s actively trying to not be a shit human being. \n\nMost bullies grow up to be Karens and cops on power trips or bosses who will scream at you in front of all your coworkers for a little mistake. They don\u2019t grow up. Most don\u2019t change. Some will feel shame for what they did, but most probably won\u2019t remember the time they beat you till you vomited, and won\u2019t care.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold kind stranger",

They don\u2019t know the pain they caused, they were just \u201cmessing around\u201d, Which is I think what happens often. And they don\u2019t know because you are no longer in front of them or important so they just log the info away. \nI think it\u2019s fair though to just cut them out. You know 1 side of them that will always exist and never go away, why would you want to know someone like that?",

Used to work for a major corporation and would go into their retail stores at the hometown mall to enjoy significant employee discounts from time to time. I was working with a particular employee who I had completely forgotten I used to go to high school with. I had experienced minor bullying from this individual from time to time, and he was quite popular. I was speaking with him extensively about a particular product and at the very end I thanked him for his input and asked him what his name was. He looked visibly taken aback because I guess he presumed I knew who he was. When he said his name even that didn't ring a bell and I politely walked out after saying thanks. It only hit me on the drive home who he was and why he was crestfallen. I kind of enjoyed that.",

Sorry if it's a long one.\n\nWe went out for a couple of months when we were 16 before he dumped me via a friend. I moved on, married, had a child and  had split up with my husband and moved back to my old area when I came across him again.\n\nIt was cool, a lot of time had passed and I didn't hold a grudge. We had a nice chat and I invited him over for a meal. To be clear, I had moved on and had no interest in him other than as an old friend, and made that very clear. We even laughed about how our relationship had ended  and he apologised for acting so badly. Additionally, he was unemployed and still lived with his mum, so even if I had been looking for romance it wouldn't have been with him. I worked, btw, and always have done.\n\nSo, he came over for dinner, met my child and it was a lovely evening. Before he left he said he would call in a couple of days. There was nothing remotely romantic about that evening, just friendly.\n\nInstead of a call I got a note through my door. It said he couldn't see me again as his mum didn't think he should get 'involved' with a single parent and he couldn't see me again. It was actually quite funny as I certainly had no intention of getting involved with anyone and I had made that obvious, as he had.\n\nFast forward to last year......30 years later. \n\nI am happily remarried (28 years) and have another grown up child.\n\n I have always worked and for the last 20 years have been with a national company, the last few as overall scottish manager of my department. Worked my way up from receptionist so yes, I'm proud of what I've achieved.\n\nSo it's a Friday after work and I'm picking up some shopping at Tesco and on the way to the car I pass the taxi queue. My phone rings (hubs wondering when I'd be home) so I stop, answer it and have a quick chat. When I hang up I hear a man call my name hesitatingly, turn around and there is the old boyfriend AND HIS MOTHER.\n\nLong story short, I started with the old \"I'm sorry, do I know you?\" but  moved on to truthfully answering his questions about how I was and what I'd been doing with myself. Of course I was polite enough to ask the same questions of him......he had never worked and, yes, still lived with his mum.\n\nWonder what she thinks of the single mother now?\n\nAlso........he looked really old.",

Last time I saw one, I froze then ran away. If I can't avoid talking to one of them, I'll try to do like you and act as if I don't remember them.\n(Sorry for my bad English)",

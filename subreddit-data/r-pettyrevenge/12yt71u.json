    "postText": "\n  Just after the last ice age, when I was in the 7th grade, I had an English teacher who can only be described as a classic evil school marm. Complete with stern, craggy face and too tight bun atop her head.\n\n  She was just the most awful person I have ever had the displeasure to meet. \nThe important part of this story is her daily ritual of taking a bottle of the old brown Listerine from her bottom drawer and taking a huge swig. The thing is, she never spit it out. Anyone who remembers the vile hair curling, tongue melting taste of that stuff knows that this is just not possible. \n\n   So, as curious teenage boys will do, I waited for an opportunity to investigate. \nI'm sure you have guessed what I discovered. You are correct. Whiskey in the bottle. So I formulated my plan for petty revenge in the name of the whole class. \n\n  At home, under the sink, I knew there was the same size bottle of \"actual\" Listerine. \nThis came to class with me in my book bag. I enlisted the help of my good friend \"The Class Clown\" who easily got himself walked out into the hall for a stern talking to. (happened at least twice a week so no worries for him) \n\n  While she berates Clown, I take my bottle of nasty and after some careful checking, I swap out her whiskey with the liquid hell and head back to my seat. I had no concern that my classmates would rat me out as Mrs. Ihateallchildren was loved equally by all. \n\n  She brings Clown back into the room, carefully guiding him by the ear, and after a moment of glaring at us, proceeds with the morning ritual. Clown had her pretty worked up so she took an extra large swig. \n\n   Then, her face twisted and contorted. Her eyes grew so large I thought they might burst from her head. Oh the glorious look of sheer panic on her face as she bolted from the room was epic. And the best part? She can't say a word about it. Not to anyone. \n\n  There you have it. My one and only petty revenge and how I became the hero to 32 7th graders.",

(God only knows what bullshit she would have told me if i'd also told her of my dream to become a forensic scientist.)  So i ended up not going to college at all, because FUCK KIDS.  As a young adult i hated the smelly little critters.  \n\nIronically, many decades later, some of the high points of my life have been my children and all the times we've spent together.  Children who i homeschooled...  And now i spend a good portion of my time at work educating adults.  i'm the go to person at the hospital for education on certain skill sets.

So all of us didn't get her of course because the school didn't want to deal with any drama.  All the kids whose parents didnt give enough of a shit got her so it was like double bad for them.

It would likely go something like this.\n\nAdmin :  \"This kid says you're drinking alcohol in class.\"\n\n\nTeacher :  \"That boy is a liar and a trouble maker. He's a constant disruption in class.\"\n\n\nAdmin :  \"Okay. That's exactly what we were thinking. Thank you, we'll call the little shit disturber's parents.\"\n\nNope. Kids were rarely believed in my generation and even less so in the ones before us. Even evidence in hand with 32 witnesses it would not go my way.\n\n\" So you not only burglarized a teacher's desk, but tried to frame her as well. We have witnesses who all saw you try to switch those bottles. Do your parents always keep liquor in the house?\"\n\nAnd now the parents get to explain how \"Your child\" got his hands on booze.\n\nGenerational mindsets are very different between then and now.",

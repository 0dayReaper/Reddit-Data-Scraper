    "postText": "During my University days my then GF and I found ourselves without an apartment for a few weeks while we transitioned from seperate housing to an apartment for just the both of us. Luckily it was summer, and our University allowed anyone to rent rooms in the shared dormitory (Halls in UK talk) while the first-years moved out for summer. \n\nNow shared housing, especially with strangers, is rarely ever a good experience, and this was no different. Fortunately we were only there a couple of weeks.  \nEach hall had 10 rooms. Ours was full so we knew we had 8 strangers who shared our kitchen, this included fridge. Nothing can be locked, there's no personal boxes or anything. And sure enough quite consistently food began dissapearing from our section of the fridge. Most specifically the thief seemed to have a real penchant for sausage rolls. We had no idea who the thief might be, and we made no attempt to get to know the strangers in our dorm but there was one particular neighbour I suspected due to the fact they blasted music till 3AM with no regard for anyone else. I had spoken to one of my neighbours about food going missing and he was also victim to the thief, he too noticed in particular the lack of safety our sausage rolls had in particular.\n\n  \nWe tolerated it till the last few days, but I had a plan, a very petty plan. I knew there could be reprocussions if I acted too early, so on the second last night I began my operation. I purchased a packet of lovely sausage rolls from the local Tesco, brought them home in the evening and opened the pack to eat just one. The remainder... well, I paid a visit to the communal bathroom and one by one took each sausage roll out of the pack, lavishly smeared it around the inner toilet bowl, placed them back in the pack and then back in the fridge. The trap was set. And like clockwork, the next day, our last day in the dorm, sure enough the sausage rolls has dissapeared. It was a perfect plan, but it's not over. As this was my last day, I wasn't content with only myself and my GF being aware of the tarnished rolls, so as we packed up the last of our stuff I wrote a note detailing exactly what I had done to those sausage rolls and stuck it to the fridge for the thief to enjoy as we exited.\n\n  \nI hope they learnt their lesson. Even if they didn't. I felt pretty okay with it all.",

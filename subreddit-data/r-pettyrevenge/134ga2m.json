    "postText": "So when I was in my early 20s I started working as an au pair. After college I was stuck in life and thought that going to another country is a way to go.\n\nSo au pair is basically a slave work if you get the bad family. You don't pay rent and live with the family and eat the food. You only get a pocket money which was nothing. \n\nWhen I started working for this one family it was ok. The kids were ok and the parents nice. Work was easy. But with time I started being asked for more and more things to do. Also the mother was particular about the cleaning. She didn't understand that when I clean the house earlier and her kids will use the toilet then the tap will have some water stains on it. That's just an example. One time she made me clean the floor with a toothbrush. And the other time she had new bed delivered so she wanted to change beds around and wanted me to do that. It was way beyond my work pay. I told her no and she just replied \"if not you then who should be doing that? Me?\" I said that yes, her and her husband who just went on holidays when she knew that the bed will arrive when he's gone.\n\nMind you, i was only getting 400 dollars per month for that. We got into a massive argument and I decided that it's time to go. I mentioned to her that she should find another person as I am leaving. Per contract i needed to give her one month notice. She told me that if I stay two months then she will pay me some extra money. I wanted that because I didn't have a lot saved up. \n\nWhen the day came she told me that she will not pay me anything extra and she shouldn't pay me at all because I was just a terrible worker and that she was not happy with me and she didn't say that she will pay me extra anyway. I threatened her with the police so she paid. She said that before I go she wants the house to be the way she wants and left to go to the hairdressers.\n\nI got the eggs and made small holes in the shells. I put them in every single curtain rod in the house. I also hid them in the bedroom in the closet away from being seen. Threw some on top of the closet as well. Then i took my bags and left. Didn't clean at all.\n\nI wish I could see her wondering what the smell was and looking for the source of it. After months of being treated like a slave and useless person, I got my revenge.\n\nETA: As someone questioned the story being true, I have to explain. The family had very heavy curtains. Ping-pong ball had a space around itself when I inserted it. I wanted to do this for a long time, so I practiced. Although I knew they would make my life a living hell if eggs started to smell when I was there. So small egg fit there perfectly. Just about.",

It's an archaic deisgn for a job. Adult employees should get a living wage. If they live in, they don't need rent obviously, but they should be getting at $400 a week, not per month.",

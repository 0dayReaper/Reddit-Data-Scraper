    "postText": "I'll admit this is my first post on this subreddit, so I hope it fits. Let me know if it belongs elsewhere.\n\nTl:Dr at the bottom. \n\nThis story is about two of my colleagues and my boss. The first colleague is a creep, let's call him (m, late 20s) Dave. The second colleague is an absolute angel, one of the sweetest ladies I've worked with and very pretty. Let's call her (f, 35) Angela. Then there's the boss. Let's call him (M, 60ish) Roger. \n\nI work in an office with about 30 other people. It's getting quite warm, so everyone is in their summer wardrobe. \n\nAngela is wearing a very tasteful, work appropriate, summer dress. Dave keeps staring/leering at her, which makes her uncomfortable, so she asks him what he is playing at, why he keeps staring at her, and he says that she is displaying herself, flaunting her boobs around the office, and distracting everyone, and she needs to dress more formally. \n\nAs it happens, the boss's door is open and the boss is standing in the doorway listening to the whole conversation. Then, after Dave's lady comment, he asks then both to come into his office. In they go. \n\nThe door remains open, and everyone in the office is silent, straining to hear what's going on. From my seat I reckon I had the best view in the room, as my desk is virtuality in from of Roger's office. This is what we hear and see:\n\nRoger asks Dave to repeat his comments, which Dave duly does, only with more details and some embellishments. \n\nWhen he'd finished, Roger looks at Angela, looks her up and down, while wearing a concerned expression. He turns his attention back to Dave, and says, and I quote, \"David, if you are distracted by Angela's clothes or... figure, then perhaps it's... well, it's your problem. Perhaps, therefore, if you cannot concentrate on your work and are so easily distracted by a female colleague, then maybe this isn't the right environment for you, so if you choose to resign on this basis, I'll understand. \"\n\nDave had nothing to say, but a mumbled apology. He couldn't even blame Angela again. I don't think he'll last. \n\nTl:Dr: creepy guy makes creepy comments, boss hears them, boss suggests creepy guy resigns, creepy guy is defeated.",

Ok let's see how this plays out. We'll 3 weeks into that her 18 yr old SL son says some \"whoa wtf man!?!?\" Shit to one of our 16 yr Olds. I'm standing right there and I see the disqust on her face and her trying to disconnect this convo asap. I grab him and pull him into the back so it's not in plain view of dinner rush or others. His response was \"she's only 2 yrs younger what's the problem?\" It's what you said, her clear disapproval of what you said, and the fact your a shift lead that supposed to lead not creep out our employees. He wanted to argue and I was having none of that. Called his mom she said \"oh you remember being 18, girls catch your eye and you do dumb things\" wrong awnser. So I had to call the owner (I'm not repeating what he said, just know it was bad) the owner came in an hour later and fired him. Had an emergency meeting with managers and SLs next morning at 930am. He fired her and her whole family right out the gate. Were still recovering from that mess nearly 5 MO later.",

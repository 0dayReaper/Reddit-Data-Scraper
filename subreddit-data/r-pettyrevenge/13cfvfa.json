    "postText": "This was a originally a comment I made on another petty revenge post.  It got enough votes that I thought I'd go ahead post it on its own. Enjoy.\n\nTLDR:  senior coworker poaches two of my dudes. A series of petty events follow.\n\nI love petty IT revenge.  Our network had two factor authentication.   One of which was a physical card.  You were required to take the card out so no one could access your computer while you were gone.\n\nThis dude had poached two of my best from my team.  His seniority and ass kissing abilities allowed this damn travesty. \n\nOur petty team revenge was that my guys would call me when he left his card in.  I would go in via remote access and just mess with him.  \n\nChanged keywords in his auto correct, once I was feeling particularly salty and just changed 'the' to 'tle.'  \n\nI got two days (four briefs) of petty amusement out of that one.  \n\nOnce changed his email alert from the standard ping to [TIMMY!](https://youtube.com/shorts/EvlN3T1fMPk?feature=share).\n\nHe tried to complain to our boss about it.  I kept a perfectly straight face and told her that I couldn't even do that unless his card was left in the machine.   Lol.\n\nLeaving the card was an actual write up type of offense.   I almost broke out laughing; you could literally see him cycle through all the emotions on his face.  \n\nI just stood there,  no expression.  \n\nHe wouldn't admit to it, so couldn't prove I'd done it.   I topped it off with 'please submit a work ticket to get that fixed for you.'   Told our boss I'd make it a priority and would put it on the briefing slides to keep her updated.  \n\nThen I got to see him squirm in his seat while briefing our boss's boss that this high priority ticket had been solved so quickly.   \n\nOf course I took this opportunity to remind everyone (with a pointed look at TIMMY!) to please remove their keycards when leaving their office.  \n\nPretty much my favorite series if petty events ever.",

Make an invisible folder and name it '.'\n\nHide all their desktop icons in the folder.  \n\nWe had about a year working together after he poached my team.  \n\nI once changed his printer mapping to the one in our boss's boss's office.  That was fun because he'd reprint things thinking that he just didn't hit the right button.  It just left our big boss confused as he assumed they were for him.  \n\nIt took him ridiculously long (damn near a whole day) to finally ask for help.  Lol.",

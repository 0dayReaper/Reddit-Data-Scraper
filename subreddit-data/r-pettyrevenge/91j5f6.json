    "postText": "I work as a bartender in a small cocktail bar for some time now, and I'm usually chill. But bullies can still push my buttons in a wrong way. Before starting, I may be in the wrong for doing this, but it is what it is. \n\nA week ago, a bunch of guys came for a few. They seemed like OK dudes, early 20-is, but the group dinamic was kinda off. Introducing the main antagonist. Obnoxious guy, too loud, snapping his fingers at me when ordering (don't snap fingers at bartenders kids, we're not dogs), punching his friends in the shoulders all the time,... A sportier, really aggressive version of a David Spade character he was. \n\nNext to David Spade, sat the victim of most of his \"playful\" teasings. Silently enduring his shit, I really felt sorry for this fellow. He wasn't a drinker, but he looked like he would rather be drinking distilled devils piss than continue sitting next to this macho maniac. He was really uncomfortable. David continued to bugg him to take a shot at least, \"come on, one with me, don't be a pussy, a bitch,...\" until, after whole night of persuasion, finally my dude waved the white flag. Ok, lets do one shot together, then leave me be. \n\n\"Two of your most fucked up shots,\" Spade shouted snapping his fucking fingers, while I imagined snapping his fucking neck. Oh, you'll get a fucked up shot, buddy. I made this two layered shots,  but while looking almost the same, they were different. David got stuff like Red Jacques Senaux Absinthe (75% alcohol), Stroh (80% alcohol), tabasco (110% flaming diarrhea), really nasty bussiness all together, and other guy got mostly syrups, juices, harmless stuff. They looked almost identical, Red Absinth can pass visually as a cranberry juice, Stroh as a syrup from brown sugar, Sambuca as anything colorless, etc...\n\nThey took their shots and all hell broke loose. Other guy chugged his shot like a champion, not even flinching (why would he, he drank juice). But David Spade... Boy, oh boy. He looked like he'd have a brain aneurism. Tears pouring from eyes, coughing like his lungs want to come out, he had a face and a posture of a man who just got waterboarded with some sort of chilly sauce. Other guy looked surprised until he caught a wink from me, but David Spade and the rest of the crew, now roaring with laughter about his misery, suspected nothing.\n\nThey got their shots on the house, poor dude was left alone, and David was a good boy for the rest of the night, deflatedly enduring small mockings from his fellows. Now, I may have used my powers in a wrong way, but this is the first and only time I messed with customers drinks. And I regret nothing. He was rude, aggressive even, to everyone around him. Fuck you, sporty David Spade. \n\nTL;DR In a bar where I work, punished a rude person by making him a hell shot. \n\nEDIT: Was not expecting response of this magnitude! Thank you, you wonderful peoples. Your comments made my day, can't stop smiling like an idiot. Love my job, but there is always 1 guy out of 1000 that'll try to mess everyones day... And thanks for the gold! Someone is getting free shots in your name tomorrow! But the good kind. Thank you, kind sir. \n\nEDIT 2: Holy Stroh! Thanks for the second gold! Let me answer a few questions: \nNo, they didn't tip at all. I work in southern Europe, tipping among locals is not a typical thing. I earn my pay from tourists, mainly Americans and Scandinavians. \nMe being from Europe is the reason why I didn't hear about _cement mixers_ so far. And me being a faithful disciple of the craft is the reason why I tried my first cement mixer today. Boy, oh boy, did that come to bite me in the ass. TIFU\n\nHere's a recipe for a \"Fuck you, David Spade\": Equal parts of Sambuca Molinari, Red Absinthe Jacques Senaux (75%), freshly squeezed lime juice and Austrian liquer Stroh (80%). Add tabasco at will, you can mix it with lime juice. Use a bar spoon if you want to make a layered shot. Stroh is placed at the top, because it's the best burning alchohol - you can make a flaming shot out of it, a \"Burned David Spade\", if you like.\n\nDisclaimer: I have nothing against real David Spide, I like him actually. But his sporty doppelganger deserves a kick in the butt.",

I had a deal with the bartender that she charge 2 bucks a shot so she got paid up front. I took nothing other than the pleasure of getting my friends fucked up on the cheap.  \n\nEnter 2 huge tatted up assholes wearing idiotic \"I love the flag, guns, etc.\" shirts. Super fucking dicks, pushing people around and just being aggressive as hell. One of them finds out I brought the limoncello, and had the bartender send over what I thought was like a water glass full. Knowing I could drink it, but not really wanting to, the bartender gave him the same. I started drinking mine and realized it was lemonade. His, pure limoncello. He almost puked, held it in, then ran to the can. I looked at the bartender and she just smiled LOL! Both assholes left after that, and we never saw them again. It always helps to keep your bartender loaded up with free weed ;)\n",

I use about 6 organic lemons (if you can find any decent ones) and use a really sharp vegetable peeler to get the rind off without getting any pith. Soak those in a fifth of the cheap version of Everclear for about 2 weeks in the dark. I strain it out and pour it into a 1.75 liter bottle, and top it off with simple sugar. Let it sit in the dark for another month, and you've got limoncello. You can make it with 100 proof vodka instead if you don't want it that strong. Either way it's pretty good. You can make it with oranges or limes too. The orange and lime ones are really awesome too. ",

Not one to fuck with someone\u2019s sobriety, I poured a shot of apple juice and put just a splash of coke so it was the same color as the others. When I bought them to the table I made sure to say hey this one\u2019s for you and gave him a wink when they weren\u2019t looking. He didn\u2019t pick up on it the first time and I had to repeat myself, which I totally understand. His buzzed friends were excited that he was drinking and he thanked me after he smelled it. I try and pass this tip on to friends or other service workers. Apple juice shots saved my buddy on his birthday lol I feel like the social pressure to drink is fucked up, especially with younger adults and guys in particular. Also, I\u2019d say 99% of the time your waiter would like to help if you let them know to make yours a water with salt and lime or apple juice or whatever. Might still charge for it though lol",

Obviously Tobasco is always a good F you.\n\nBesides, I'm sure you've heard of a cement mixer. Joke shots are a thing. The customer was disrespectful and he gave you the opportunity to reciprocate.",

    "postText": "This happened back in the late 90's during my senior year in high school. \n\nMy English Lit teacher Mrs H. had this absolute fixation on Shakespeare for some reason. During the whole year, we didn't learn anything about any other English authors or poets or... anything really. Some people complained but she had been there for so long, the school couldn't really do anything. I even saw her pic in the faculty section of my mother's yearbook from the same school, with the same Victorian Era hairdo. Also, she disliked kids and was batshit crazy. Me, having long hair and a goatee (I thought goatees were cool, stupid kid) meant she hated me.\n\nOn the other hand, I was slightly gifted with either natural intelligence or just super lucky. I never had to study, and just knew how to absorb the right info and ace tests. I abused this and never did homework and just used quizzes and tests to pass classes. Out of all her classes, I was her nemesis it seemed. She reformatted her grading system to make sure I failed if I didn't turn in all homework assignments or get a lot of extra credit. This is where the gears in my brain shifted into high gear.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, I had been on the school's stage crew since my freshman year. Anything that happened in the auditorium, assemblies, talent shows, and even after-school rentals... we did that. We ran the lights, sound and coordinated everything on stage. During that time, and with my Stage Crew teachers help I had developed some moderate skills at designing and setting up lighting plans and he helped me get work outside of school. One of such jobs was a local troupe performing \"Much Ado About Nothing\" at the local amphitheater. \n\nOpening night arrived and me and my friend were just hanging out in the booth when his eyes bugged out while looking at the people coming in. \"Is that Mrs. H?\" I looked and sure as shit it was her. Up to this point I still hadn't figured out how to fight back, but now it was as clear as could be.\n\nNext day at school, start of class... I raise my hand and mention that I heard a Shakespeare  show is playing at the Amp, and could we get 20pts extra credit if we turned in a program with a production member's signature. She loved the idea of more people getting into her Shakespeare fetish and immediately said Yes, absolutely. I whipped a program out of my folder, circled my name and signed next to it. Walked up and set it on her desk. I still feel fear when I remember the look in her eyes. But, to her credit, I turned a program for all 3 nights, and she gave me 20 pts for each. Which was just enough to make sure I got my diploma.\n\nI don't know if she did it because she stuck to her word, of if she finally found a worthy nemesis. Most likely is that she just never wanted to see me again.\n\nTL;DR... Nah. It's not that long.",

All cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well, which is the same thing. And then the man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face, like some rhino-hunters I know or Belmonte, who is truly brave... It is because they make love with sufficient passion, to push death out of their minds... until it returns, as it does, to all men... and then you must make really good love again.",

It was a blatant thumb-of-the-nose to the traditional style of writing to that point.\n\nIMO the modern era's more informal language usage becoming acceptable in literary works but also in journalism can be greatly attributed to him, because he showed you can still be an effective communicator, you can still have emotional impact, without the formality and flourishes that had been *de rigeur* prior to him. \n\nHe showed that a spare, even plain, choice of words can say more, and more clearly, than the most elaborate Proustian construction. Flaubert is much the same, the French answer to ol' Ernie (yeah, I said it - fight me).\n\nThat being said... a lot of his work feels pretentious to me, too \ud83d\ude02",

A teacher that had the classroom beside ours went down and got the principal, thinking we had a substitute teacher coming. Principal unlocks the door and flicks on the lights and she picks her head up with yesterdays makeup smudged all over her and an empty bottle of wine on the desk. I vividly remember her staggering out of the class, escorted by the principal. We were too young to really get it but when we were older we had a laugh about it.

            "comment": "God I still have nightmares about Senior Year English class. It was Old English Literature and to this day my opinion of it being a requirement to graduate is not printable even in Reddit. Like your teacher, mine just loved it, reveled in it and a bound compilation of Shakespeare's work was her orgasmatron.\n\nThrough out the whole year my grades in English had varied from 65 to 75 (70 -79  was a D, 80-89 was a C, 90 -95 was a B and 96 -100 was an A). I had a grade point average in English of about 71 and poor performance on mid term and final was a death knell as state requirements mandated you had to not only attain an average grade of 70 including the mid-term and final exams, but you had to have 70 or better on each of the mid-term and final.\n\nSure enough, when the final grades were published I scored 69. Well that meant I was going to have to repeat my senior year and get a whole lot of guff from Mom and Dad.  So after checking the grade postings I stopped off at the Electronic Instructors class to ask to be allowed to audit his class (it was a 3 hour class in the senior year) as I had to spend at least 4 hours in the class room to attend classes. The last thing I wanted to do was spend  three additional hours in another math, history and foreign language class and deal with the academic requirements in those classes.\n\nAfter inquiring and explaining my predicament, the Electronics Instructor told me to have a seat and he would be back in about 15 minutes.  About half an hour later he re-appeared and told me not to worry, I had actually scored 70 on my final. Huh? I was told to ask,  \"No more questions.\" So I graduated.\n\nYears later I encountered the Electronics Instructor and upon asking him how he convinced the English teacher to bump my final grade he explained. \"I pointed out that she was the only Grade 12 English instructor and since you were planning another year as opposed to summer school, she would have you in her class for another year. Initially there was anger in her face, then dispair. I do not know all that transpired between you and that woman, but she pulled out the grade book, and changed your 69 to a 70. I thanked her and left.\"\n\nI am forever grateful to the Electronics Instructor. He saved one of us from prison and the other from being a victim of homicide. I am not sure which of us would have been the homicidal maniac, as both of us were probably standing on the same precipice side by side.",

No, there might have been one or two souls in the class that actually learned to read any of it, but by golly the teacher did indeed use her unfettered power to drag us through memorizing at least one bit. The thing that stands out today is the fact it was easier to learn to send and receive text,  numbers and punctuation using International Morse Code than memorize six lines of Beowulf in Old English. Most of the material presented in class was translated but the syntax was much like English used in King james Version of  The Bible. At least failing to read the Bible only resulted in condemnation to live eternity in Hell after you died, in that class you lived in hell while still alive.",

My teacher hated that I once commented that I thought William Shakespeare was overrated. Around 2 months into the semester there was a national poetry competition and Eng Lit teach pulled aside maybe 2 students from each of her classes to submit something (in front of the class, so everyone knew who she deemed exceptional). I was not one of them (surprise!). My history teacher, however, encouraged me to submit some work to the competition. I got 2nd place. Hist teach got all kinds of recognition and such from the other teachers at school (possibly from the competition as well? I don't even remember which comp it was) because I put his name down as my teacher. He was the basketball coach and legitimately didn't care about teaching; he only had the hist classes so he could coach. None of Eng Lit teach's students even qualified; she asked me after results were in why I didn't include her name as my English teacher, after all, this was a writing competition (and I assume it was hot gossip in the office that the basketball coach, not the Eng Lit teacher, had found a 'poet'). \"Because you didn't ask me to submit anything\". It was like her brain short-circuited, she just stared blankly at me and eventually said \"oh, ok.\" Made all A's after that and she retroactively changed all my D's to B's and A's.\n\nClearly I did not go on to become a poet or anything lol",

I had to take an art class or be in band/choir in order to graduate high school. I chose art because I'm terrible at art, but even worse when it comes to music (and wasn't keen on doing something I'm very bad at, in front of a crowd).\n\nI didn't want to be in an art class, but I really did try. I recognized that it was part of a \"full\" education, I had to do it, and I wanted as good of a grade as possible. I got a \"C\", and the only reason I can think of why my grade was so bad is because I can't draw or paint anything to save my life. I didn't miss classes, I listened and participated, I turned in all my assignments (and turned them in on time), even stopped in a couple times after school to talk to the teacher about a few problems I was having with assignments. And I genuinely tried to do as good as I could in the class. I was really upset when I got that bad of a grade. It didn't feel fair. If you can't draw, *you can't draw*...but I was forced to take a class that I knew I would perform poorly in, and it didn't feel like my effort was recognized. Anyway.",

Two weeks every year doesn't strike me as an excessive amount of time to devote to the world's most influential English-language writer, especially since he has far more than just three important plays.\n\nHowever, if they're spending any more time per play than that, then I would agree that it's too long, but that's not because Shakespeare doesn't deserve it but because there's nothing to be gained by thrashing one of his plays to death. A situation like the OP described is clearly excessive. Classes specializing in Shakespeare should be saved either for electives or for college courses.",

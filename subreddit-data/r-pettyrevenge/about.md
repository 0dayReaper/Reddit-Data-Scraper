Description:

For all your stories of small victories over those who've wronged you.

Rules:

No Requests: Do not ask for help to enact some sort of petty revenge! This includes telling a story and ending with "What would you have done?", "What are your thoughts?", "Any other ideas?" All direct and indirect requests for ideas will result in a ban.

Stories should be petty, not serious.: Stories should be petty. I messed with their toothpaste. I turned their disk upside-down in their XBox. I gasp put shaving cream in their shoes. The more creative the better, (If you have a not so-petty revenge, post it in /r/prorevenge!)

Stories should not be serious. No: murder, rape, assault, grand theft (petty theft acceptable), or any other felonies. NO VANDALISM.

No harassment/racism/sexism/bigotry: Harassment, racism, sexism, and other bigotry will not be tolerated, either in posts or in comments.

Follow the reddiquette: Always follow and adhere to the [Reddiquette](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette)

No advertising/self-promotion: Advertising/self-promotion will lead to a ban.
It is strictly not allowed.

No fake posts: Stories should be true. If a claim seems impossible or probably false, you will be asked for proof.

Karma and Account Age Requirements: Due to the massive amount of new accounts, there has been a chance that some of those accounts may be potential spammers/karma-farmers, and because of that, we have decided for the best to add a karma and account age requirement, you must have:

* 150 karma (combined)

* An account for 2 weeks

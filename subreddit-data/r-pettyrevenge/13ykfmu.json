    "postText": "My fianc\u00e9e and I rent a house from her mother\nIf my fianc\u00e9e does anything her mother doesn\u2019t like (for instance going out of town for a night for a date) her mother threatens to kick us out. You know those abysmal people who suck the joy out of everyone who they see is having fun? Yea she\u2019s one of those. Long story short, the last straw was when she withheld my fianc\u00e9es medicine for her chronic and life threatening illness until rent was given to her (this was days before rent was even due). When my fianc\u00e9e started getting angry, she called her a little girl and wouldn\u2019t tell her where her medicine was. She also said she will evict us over that. \nAfter receiving the medicine I started planning petty revenge. I learned that not only is the house my fianc\u00e9 and I are living in right now is in her ex-husbands name, but so is her house. \nVery soon she will see exactly how my fianc\u00e9e and I feel right now, because she has an eviction notice on the way.\nEdit: My fianc\u00e9e has approved all of this\nEdit2: Also it is important to note, her father is willing to do a rent to own with us. Terms being the houses get transferred into my fianc\u00e9es name. Which makes this post all the sweeter!\nEdit 3: we have told the hospital to hold her medication there no matter what.\nEdit 4: You guys are right I probably should\u2019ve just called the police. My thought was stay quiet until I can inflict the most suffering possible. \n\nUPDATE ALREADY: Her mother is now texting her claiming the house has 3 showings tomorrow. The doors have number entry locks, so I have a strong feeling those will be locked tomorrow. Unless you guys think it would be better to let them look at the home only to be ghosted by her mother because it\u2019s not even her home! Opinions? This is gonna get spicy earlier than we thought!\n\n\nUpdate: Guys this is getting nuts. She just came over with two prospected buyers walked in the unlocked door with her. She told them that a licensed plumber and electrician installed the plumbing. My fianc\u00e9e couldn\u2019t hold her tongue. \u201cWhy are you lying?\u201d The potential buyers looked stunned. \nTold her and them to get tf out of the house because we didn\u2019t have proper notice. She called me a smart ass and I told her to stfu and she left. She will be back after the potential buyers see the other home.\n\nUpdate: she came over asking for me by name\n\u201cYou don\u2019t live here get out\u201d\n\u201cI have receipts and bank statements that say otherwise.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re so disrespectful this isn\u2019t your house\u201d\nMe again \u201cI\u2019m going to sit my ass right in this house until you get me an official eviction notice with a date on it now get tf out\u201d",

In a comment he explains \"they can never find our house number\". Who is \"they?\" UPS? FedEx? USPS? With modern GPS navigation systems? They can't deliver a package to your house?\n\nI'm also very skeptical of the claim that this woman has gotten far enough into the process of selling the home to have potential buyers visiting, without ever having to show proof of ownership.

Our neighbor has his number on his mailbox. The issue is that our houses jump numbers, so delivery people expect his house to be mine and don't bother checking. 4 times in 6 months FedEx sent my medication to the (vacant) neighbor's house. The medication that keeps me alive 24hrs at a time. Once they left it there in the snow. Ruined the delivery. Once they left it in the heat. Ruined the delivery. Twice we found it in time. And one of the 2 deliveries that came to our house was left by our garage with no notice and it ruined that delivery, too. At the time the medication cost $8,000-$10,000 for 3 months, depending on the pharmacy, and FedEx had to cover it every time. But, I needed the actual medicine. So we fought with the insurance company to let me use a local pharmacy and won.\n\nAgain, the rest might not be true, but getting meds delivered can be a pita if the delivery company is lazy.",

Enlisted a realtor, got valuations, had photos taken, etc, all before his body was even in the ground.\n\nExcept her father didn't own it. When her parents split he didn't have the money or credit to buy her out of both the house and all the toys (the cars, the motorcycles, the powerboat, the cabin) so her mother took the house plus enough cash to buy something small close to the schools she wanted the kids to attend and made him pay rent in lieu of alimony.\n\nThe first time my friend or the step-mother heard about him not owning it was at the funeral when her mother generously offered to forget about the rent for a while until things had calmed down. She may have been teary before it was said, but afterwards she was a total basket case.",

If you rent a room/apartment/house to someone, you absolutely cannot just walk in any time you want just because you're the landlord. And since her daughter is old enough to get married, I'll assume she's over 18, or whatever is considered a legal adult where you live. \n\nThat could be trespassing and theft. Maybe more since what she stole was medicine for a chronic life threatening condition. It wouldn't matter if you guys had never paid a single dime in rent since signing the lease (which, it sounds like she doesn't have the authority to rent out in the first place) landlords are simply not allowed to just waltz in and take whatever they want as compensation. At least not in the US, and I would imagine most major western nations. Not without first going to court, getting a formal eviction, and then permission from the court to seize property to sell for back rent.\n\nDepending on how far you want to escalate things, your fiance could press charges against her and the father could also probably demand that the future MIL hand over any rent money she collected from you two because she doesn't have any legal right to rent out the property. And if she changes the locks, go to the cops and say she is not the legal owner of the property nor the property manager, the legal owner of the property didn't authorize any eviction actions, and she hasn't actually initiated the eviction process from what I'm reading. Probably would also be a good idea to talk to a tenants rights lawyer to get some sense of what other options you may have and make sure you don't get yourself in trouble in your efforts.",

Opening someone else's mail is absolutely not allowed without express permission from the intended recipient. You could report it to the local postmaster. They will likely take it quite seriously. I can't say for sure, but I imagine most other majority english speaking countries have similar laws. You also need to talk to someone at the hospital about fixing that. I'm sure if you mention someone else was confiscating the meds it would get some very serious attention very quickly. The idea that meds from their pharmacy could be sold on the black market because they were too lazy to correct an address... let's just say there are probably several layers of managers there who absolutely do not want that particular headache and will crack as many skulls as necessary to get things fixed before any government agencies catch wind of it. In the US, Medicare's enforcement arm is no joke. They're the ones who shut down Theranos and forced them to invalidate all test results. Feel free to mention it to your insurance company as well (if applicable) since they're paying the bulk of the cost.\n\nMy one bit of personal advice is to let your fianc\u00e9 be the one to take the lead on all this. Be there to back her play, but let her be the one who makes all the decisions and initiates any kind of retaliation. Hopefully you live happily ever after and will be laughing about this when you're both old and gray, but you never know.",

Thing is mother is a messi and never cared for nor did anything at all in or around the house, so we started cleaning she hated that and started to make our lifes miserable the last straw was when she send us the eviction. I laughed because it said we have to leave the east side app. i just called dad and told him her boyfriend lived there with her. In the divorce paper it was clearly stated that she can live there rent free for the rest of her life but she is not allowed to let someone live with her.

    "postText": "I'm not usely petty, but if you mess with my fianc\u00e9 (fake name : Paul(21M), watch your back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, about four years ago, I(21F) moved in with my in-laws. (Step-mother, step-sister (25F, fake name: Jess) (+her boyfriend) and mine,) All went well, until Jess got dumped. She started getting jealous that her little brother got to be loved and not her. So the drama begun. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe started to say that he was selfish and that I shouldn't lived with them anymore because she didn't have the same ''luck'' as him. On top of that, she did EVERYTHING she could to mess with Paul and I. Meaning, she would use the bathroom just so we couldn't get ready for work, put our thooth brushes in the toilet, set 23 alarms from 4 o'clock to 6, just to wake up at 8. Let her stuff on the counters, doesn't participate to keep the place clean. Her jealousy got even worse when Paul got a new car.. She had to have one too, exactly the same. We tried multiple times to talk to her, without any results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, I cleaned the kitchen and put her lotery tickets (that she bought in March, but we were in May) on the table so she could finally bring them with her (after her mother asked four times to take care of it).  Fast forward... She wrote a note saying that I was just a bitch and I shouldn't touch her things. That I should stop acting like I owned the place.. On that same night, she hurt my cat's leg by stepping on him. It couldn't be an accident. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's when I started to plan my little, but sour, revenge. I had enough of her childish behaviour. \n\nTo resume, I made her life miserable without anyone noticing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe always said that the dog was hers and not the family's (Even tough she never took care of him). I made him mine. Now, she can't even approach it whitout the risk of being bitten. (Don't worry, it is fine with everyone else.) For her mother, I cleaned the house, but l don't touch any of Jess' belongings. Which means that her mother always sees that Jess doesn't do anything in the house, but complain. After having enough of Jess' trash everywhere, her mom asked her to change or leave. Jess is leaving in two months. She didn't knew which place to go. I said to not move in a certain town beacause of the traffic. Guess where is she going? Exactly where I told her not to go. That is perfect, beacause that is what I wanted. The traffic will only get more intense because there will be a lot of streets that will be renovated. She doesn't know that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I know she's going away, I took the liberty to buy (because I'm always nice with her) and mess with all of the boxes, I made them waeker by making small holes on the bottom so that when she lifts them, they all open and possibly (hopefully) breaks her stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, she has a habit of creating diseases for herself. Before it was a problem with her stomach, after it was diabities (her friend's boyfriend had it) and now she is hypochondriac. So to keep with all of her lies, she has to act like an hypochondriac. So, everytime I get the chance, I talk about a new or unknown diseases to make her ''panic''.  That makes her buy lots and lots of pills (no, she doesn't take them). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I make her buy a lot of stuff that isn't useful. I talk a lot about trendy things I would like to get. She always gets them to make me jealous... It went to a point where she had to make a loan to pay her credit card. (15 000$).\n\nShe officially leaves in one month. I'll keep you guys updated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I'm not usely petty, but don't mess with my family.",

The first time I saw them do it, I sreamed so loud everybody jumped and asked what's wrong. I told them that if they'd do it again, I would beat the grap out of each and every one who ever touched the dog. I think it's a this moment the dog \"took my side\". My in laws are not bad people, they never had a dog and didn't knew better to get it to listen. Jess was the one who hurt the dog more. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

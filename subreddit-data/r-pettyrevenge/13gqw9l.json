    "postText": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nNext-door neighbors were just inconsiderate, trashy, and generally unpleasant. Examples: He and his wife were too lazy to actually take their trash out of the house into the rolling containers provided by the city, so they left theirs right by their front porch with the lid flipped open and would just throw trash into it from up on the porch, and they didn't always make it in, so there was trash all around it too. It was very stinky and attracted all kinds of critters. The guy came over one day and said it had filled with water over the last week or so and a squirrel had gotten in and drowned. He asked my husband to come help him empty/fish it out because it was so heavy. Husband reluctantly agreed, went over and turned right back around when he saw the situation: dead squirrel had evidently been there a while as it was all bloated and gross, floating in rancid water along with their house garbage. They also would do charming things like take old tires to a nice wooded lot down the street and dump them there, blow their leaves into our yard, etc. The kicker, though, was one day when my sweet fluffy German Shepherd was in the backyard and I went out to hang out with him. Gussy saw me coming with his ball and got excited and started barking--just a few excited, happy barks, nothing crazy.  I guess Mr. Jackass didn't know I'd come outside, because he started yelling horrible things at my dog, telling him to STFU or he'd jump the fence and kick him in the gd throat. He couldn't see me because we have a privacy fence, but I pointedly called out loudly, \"come here, sweet boy,\" and the yelling stopped.\n\nOne breezy spring evening a few weeks later, I was in the backyard with my buddy again and could smell and hear that Mr. and Mrs. Jackass were grilling burgers or steaks or something and I got an idea.  Now if you know anything about German Shepherds, you know they shed a TON, no matter how often you brush them. I went back into the house, got my pup's brush and comb and went back outside, sat about 3' from the fence and started brushing him. Usually I would do my best to keep the hair from poofing into the air and have a bag to put the hair from the brush in because really, it's a lot and super annoying and gross  to have dog hair floating in the air, even if it belongs to a dog you love with all your heart. This time, though, I just let it all fly and would sometimes even wait for the breeze to kick up and toss hair into the air...which was traveling over the fence and right into the area they were grilling in. Oh, oopsie!\n\nTLDR: Jerky neighbor yells threatening things at my dog, so I \"accidentally\" brush him outside while they were grilling their dinner.",

I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, I DIDNT MEAN TO PULL HER HAIR OUT!!* Poor kid. We reassured her it was OK, just Tasha's spring shedding. Probably took her outside and showed her the full extent of what a Siberian sheds.  Enough floof to make a whole 'nother dog.",

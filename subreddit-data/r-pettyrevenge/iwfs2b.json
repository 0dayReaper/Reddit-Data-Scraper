    "postText": "I've been enrolled in a cooking school for over year and my mom, she's never been supportive. Because i dropped out of a nursing program to get into a cooking school. She's always making snide comments about how i should've been a nurse or a lawyer, or how i'll only ever be a subservient housewife with this, and when i do make something, she always crizicizes it. Like she's Gordon Ramsay or something \"Oh, too much salt.\" \"It's undercooked.\" \"It looks like crap\". Even though, pretty much everyone else says the opposite. She's looking for any little thing she can critique about my cooking. She keeps telling me i can't cook and need to get into a real career.\n\nI've cooked 3 course dinners for the family and they always get positive reviews, except for her. She had a party for her work friends, I made a whole tray of my specialty take on homemade meatballs (A recipe i conceptualized myself, my signature dish). Everyone kept going back and getting more, so many that they ran out. I asked mom what she thought, she said \"They were drunk, they couldn't taste anything.\"\n\nSo, i figured if i wanted to get her to compliment my cooking, i'd have to trick her. I cooked her a meal, one of her favorites from scratch, her biggest weakness that she can never resist. Dressed it up to look professional and put it in a generic To-Go Box and had my boyfriend take video of me preparing it, start to finish. I called her and told her that my boyfriend and i were eating at this diner (that doesn't exist), made up a fake name for it and everything. I told her they had her favorite meal and asked if she wanted us to bring her one. Of course, she said yes. I brought the dish and told her more about the fake diner, she started eating it and complimented how good it was. How she wanted to go there and get another one. After she was almost through with the meal, i asked her for her honest opinions, so we could write a review on Yelp. She went on for 10 minutes about how great it was and then i sprung it on her. That i cooked it.\n\nHer tone changed. She put the fork down and said she was lying, that it tasted like crap. My boyfriend showed her the video, she googled the restaurant and it didn't show up. She started pointing out flaws with the meal, like how there was too much sauce and it was really spicy and burned her mouth. I asked her why she almost finished the whole thing if it was so spicy. She didn't say anything, so i just asked her if she was ready to admit it. She said no, so we left but i spotted her eating it from the other room, i asked her again and she laughed and finally told me yes. That i'm a good chef.\n\nSo, after a year of doubting i was a good chef and holding my dreams back, she finally admitted it.",

Her support REALLY shouldn\u2019t have to be tricked out of her, as a kind mother would offer support and encouragement, not weaseling her way out of a compliment in the first place....\n\nAnyway, I bet you\u2019re an amazing cook, and let me know if you ever decide to ship your food out!! Keep going!!",

In the industrial versions that strip is far longer and sharper. The boxes tend to fall apart. A woman was carrying one the of boxes with some other stuff, the the box slipped and she went to grab it, grabbed it by the edge, and ended up with 27 stitches and 3 surgeries trying to get a cadaver nerve replacement.\n\nDude was cleaning the backline, was washing the back steel wall, someone didn't hit the breaker box for him like they were suppose too, the electrical fireball was insane that came out of that socket.\n\nI get why you would think that nurses have a more dangerous job with all the diseases and such. Nursing might be more deadly, but it certainly isn't more dangerous.",

I've experimented with different mix-in's . But the combo that works for me is taking about 2 pounds of ground beef in a big bowl and mixing it with a grated potato, a grated onion, and egg. Mix it well and add salt and pepper. Form the mixture into the shape of meatballs. (Some of the other stuff i've tried in the mix is shredded cheese, sour cream, black olives, but nothing really tasted as great as this combo)\n\nThe sauce is a teaspoon of chopped parsley, 13 ounces of chili sauce, a dash of worchestershire, and 5 ounces of grape jelly (The jelly part sounds a little extreme but trust me). Take a skillet and blend all of that together over medium heat. Add the meatballs,  cover and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occassionally. Every 5 minutes or so. Let them sit in the sauce before serving though, so they absorb the flavor, but make sure they're still warm when served (Like Fries, This is one dish that doesn't taste good cold or reheated).\n\nAfter that, just put the meatballs on a serving tray, then skim out any fat from the sauce and poor it over the meatballs and that's it.\n\nKeep in mind, this recipe was for a party full of people and not a single person meal. So that's why the portions seem large. It usually makes about 35-40 meatballs.",

When she was forced to declare her major in college, she picked Spanish, because she was good at it and still really didn't know what she wanted to do with her life. Language majors at her school are heavily encouraged (but not required) to spend a year abroad in a country that speaks that language, so she went to Paraguay.\n\nShe came back and dropped out of school, and started taking culinary classes. For a little while she worked for a family friend who owned a catering business.\n\nToday, my sister is a manager at a bakery. She owns her own house, and it's financially stable enough that last school year she hosted an exchange student from France (although unfortunately he and all the other students in the program were forced to go home early due to COVID).\n\nFortunately for my sister and unlike your mom, the people in my family love her cooking, and always look forward to the cookies and muffins she brings to the family reunions.",

Your mom is insanely jealous that you have a career path you are passionate about and talented in, and for many people it\u2019s just too much to handle. Being a chef is awesome, fulfilling, and a career choice that isn\u2019t going ANYWHERE. If you get the chance, watch Chef\u2019s Table. There are a lot of amazing stories about Michelin-Star restaurateurs who had similarly harsh and unsupportive parents. Good luck to you and keep kickin ass!",

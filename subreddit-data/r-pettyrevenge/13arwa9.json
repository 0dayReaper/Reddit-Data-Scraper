    "postText": "Back in the day (decades ago!) MacDonalds had a hair policy , men weren't allowed to have long hair. No idea if that's still true. I had the (at the time) common shaved underside and long top hair, which would go down past my face. For the first year i always showed up wearing my hat, so no one had a clue. Then we had a Christmas event that for some reason i attended and they saw me for the first time with no hat. Immediately on my next shift the threats of cut your hair or you are fired started, even though LITERALLY FOR A YEAR they couldn't tell i had long hair because it was up in my hat.\n\nI fought them on it for over 6 months, may have been 12. I didn't care that much about the job, but I wasn't going to give them the satisfaction of quitting before I was ready. So we fought, every shift. Got a 10 cent raise that performance review, in large because of it. Honestly I kept that hair longer than I intended, mostly cause fuck you, not giving you the satisfaction.\n\nFinally it was time for me to quit. I shaved my head, showed up with no hat, the manager came out and was like \"all right, awesome, you finally cut your hair\" and i was like \"yup, i quit\". The look on his face made me consider that perfect pettyness for the year of annoyance.\n\nMcDonalds has always been and will always be stupid as shit.",

Still not anything worthy of pissing off the hair police. Plus my facial hair is blond, so it isn't all that visible in the first place. Some people just don't have the genes to make their facial hair worthy of pissing someone off.\n\nHaving barely visible facial hair has its upsides though. Back during military service the rule was that you have to shave daily unless your facial hair is at least a centimeter long. After a while I got fed up with shaving and just stopped. By the time the platoon commander (or sergeant major?) noticed I stopped shaving, it was already long enough.",

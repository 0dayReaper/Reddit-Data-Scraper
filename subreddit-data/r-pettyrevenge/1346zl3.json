    "postText": "So about a year ago, I was at a lake way north from where I live. I came back to the parking lot to find my car blocked in by someone who thought it was a genius idea to leave their car directly behind 3 parked cars (I was the middle car, definitely couldn't get out).\n\nI waited and waited, and right before I was going to call a tow truck a couple walks up and casually gets in the car and proceeds to drive off. I quickly backed up, circled around the other way to get to the parking lot exit first. I get to the exit, and he's right behind me. I throw the car in park, and just sit there. 10 seconds later, he's laying on the horn. Eventually he gets out and walks up to my window and starts yelling profanities and tells me to get out of the way.\n\nSomething to note here, there is only one exit in this parking lot, and the entrance for some reason has one way spikes to prevent people from leaving that way. No idea why, since this is just the parking lot for a lake. Anyway, I cut him off and tell him he made me wait 17 minutes and 20 seconds (I timed it) when he illegally blocked me in and I intend to wait 17 minutes and 20 seconds to let him leave.\n\nHe storms off, calls me a few names in the process, and floors it in reverse. He drives down to the entrance and without noticing the spikes I guess, drives right into them. I see his brake lights come on at the last minute, and *pow* both front tires are done.\n\nI then decided 17 minutes was a waste of time since he'd clearly be there longer than that, and so I left. Made the rest of my day feel much better.",

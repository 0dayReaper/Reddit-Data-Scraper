    "postText": "Obligatory apologizes for format, I am on my phone. \nThis happened about 12 years ago. I was attending my family reunion with about 400 members in attendance. My dad\u2019s girlfriend dropped the bomb that they got engaged with no warning. My dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was very rude to my brothers and I since we met her and was very petty. My family also didn\u2019t like her. Here\u2019s the kicker though: my dad made my mom sign a prenup because he had a good paying job. When my mom filed for divorce 5 years prior to this family reunion, she ended up having way more than him and he was dragging out the divorce to get alimony. The fianc\u00e9 saw that she finally won my dad because she was the one mistress that got a ring.\n\nAnyway, throughout the day, the fianc\u00e9 would goad me into commenting on her ring or engagement but I wouldn\u2019t because I knew I couldn\u2019t say anything nice. She knew I was upset my dad hadn\u2019t asked us if we liked her enough to support an engagement so she wanted to twist my words to get me in trouble. She did this often and it would result in me being emotionally, verbally, and often physically injured by my dad. \n\nBy the end of the day, I was exhausted being basically chased and incriminated. Tbh I had more patience as a 13 year old than I do at 25. Here\u2019s where I got revenge for myself and my mom who was trapped in the never-ending divorce. She confronted me and told me I was rude for not telling her congratulations and asking why I had no manners. I looked right at her in front of a group of my aunts and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he bothered proposing, he won\u2019t sign the divorce papers with my mom.\u201d I can\u2019t remember what happened immediately after that because I truly believed I wouldn\u2019t live to see the next hour. But I did. My idiot dad had the unsigned divorce papers in his truck at the reunion and the fianc\u00e9 found them. She ran around the most dangerous part of town screaming her head off. My grandma had to track her down and drag her to the car by the hair. I sat in the backyard with my cousins getting eaten by mosquitos while I heard my grandma, great grandma, and aunt threaten my now step mom that if she stepped out of line and embarrassed them again in their town, it would be the last thing she ever did. She left me alone after that and I secured my mom\u2019s divorce that summer.\n\nEdit: typos",

I also have that diagnosis and have been falling back into the cycle of horrible dreams that stay with me all day. The therapist that I bonded with most has passed away from cancer and the one that I liked second to her isn't taking new clients. Even though I'm not a new client I just haven't seen her for over a year so they're going to make me start over. My stepmom pretended to be nice till she moved in with me and my dad. Then slowly started throwing away everything from my childhood and my time with my parents to make it her own.  Then finally got rid of me. My dad was my rock.  Now I talk to him maybe once a week.",

I might sound like a broken record but finding a good therapist *and* medication is what helped me. I tried out a couple of therapists before I found one that checked every box. I recommend sitting down and writing out a list of areas your ideal therapist needs to be familiar with. Personally, I needed one that was familiar with my culture, a woman, she needed to be similar to me in my politics (I\u2019m in the US), a LOT of coping skills at their disposal, and one that offered EMDR. I also have horrific nightmares that mess me up for days after. The EMDR felt like it wasn\u2019t helping at first and I thought it was making my anxiety worse and then one day I went through something that would have really affected me and instead I talked myself through my thoughts, came up with solutions, and overall made it through unscathed. \nTherapy alone didn\u2019t help my depression much and I was very adamantly against taking medication for a while but I reached out to a psychiatrist through the Cerebral app and got a prescription of Zoloft and propranolol. I needed my psychiatrist to also check those boxes I described earlier. Small doses but I swear after a week it was like someone turned the lights on and I wasn\u2019t walking around in the dark anymore. I\u2019ve been in therapy for about a year now with my current setup and only in the last two months have I noticed significant progress. \nGood luck to you, know that there is a whole person in you that deserves all the good in life. If you have 100 boxes a therapist needs to check, prioritize the most important ones and stick to them, you deserve it all. I should say I might have made this sound easy but it was two years in the making and progress definitely isn\u2019t linear.",

From my experiences on both sides, I would say No.\n\nIt wasn't quite the same scenario, but I once had a counselling session where the therapist was asking a series of questions that I could spot were leading up to a particular question. I gave entirely honest answers, I made no attempt to trap them, but when the expected final question came, my completely honest answer wasn't anything like what the therapist was expecting. Now, I was already losing trust in them, but when, on a telephone session, I could hear their jaw hitting the floor, I completely lost trust in them - up to that point, I had been hoping that they *would* have a considered response, instead of the \"oh shit\" reaction followedby the attempted reverse ferret.\n\nI declined to book any further sessions with that therapist.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, as a doctor, I have been told many things where such a response could have seriously damaged the therapeutic relationship. I know this, because patients who I *had* developed a good relationship with have later told me of getting such a response from a previous doctor. Indeed, I strongly suspect that some of them were actually testing me with the way that they said things, to see whether I was shockable or trustworthy.",

My dad had claimed my mom was dragging out the divorce, which appealed to fianc\u00e9 because again, she thought she \u201cwon\u201d and the thought of my mom being jealous of her made her happy. By telling fianc\u00e9 it was actually my dad dragging it out meant my mom didn\u2019t actually want what fianc\u00e9 had. It also meant my dad was less enthusiastic to marry her since she waited years and years for him to leave my mom and the only reason they were engaged was because my mom filed.\n\nAs for why she ran away, I don\u2019t really know, but that\u2019s her go-to. I think she likes the idea of being chased and groveled to maybe? She\u2019s done it several times, packing up a small bag saying she\u2019s never coming back or leaving someone\u2019s house during a holiday or celebration in a huff. Someone always goes after her which to me is asinine and only reinforces bad behavior. As to why my family bothered, it was getting late and being on the bad side of town meant she could have gotten seriously injured or worse and she wasn\u2019t familiar with the area so it\u2019s not like she could have found her way back. She was also embarrassing my family and it was the quickest way to put a stop to it.",

On top of that if you had a lot of mosquitoes then most likely there was poison ivy or poison oak nearby in the wild.  Just grab a plant with a napkin or paper towel and surreptitiously wiped their car door handles with it. Then continue the campaign with a letter mailed from a fictional girlfriend addressed to your Dad, thanking him for visiting and explaining how he was going to sack the fiance along with details of how he and the fictional girlfriend would celebrate at a resort one all was set. Make the the envelope has the name and return address of one of the Dad's flames. And if the kids get the chance, be sure to find Dad's stash of condoms and puncture each package with a needle.",

She\u2019s a fighter though, never threw up but got pretty close. \n\nFor a while I would sign my dad up to receive deals from shopping stores, specifically forever21 and VS. Admittedly, I did this in the past year with political campaigns after I got a nasty text from him.

Also more apologies, I\u2019m long winded! I was very hesitant to talk to anyone. My thought process was that if someone really knew me, they\u2019d either reject me or use what they know against me. Therapy in the beginning is hard and I was hesitant to bring up anything because I\u2019m a control freak and being unfiltered goes against my instincts. You have to recognize that you are giving someone more of *you* than you have probably anyone else.There\u2019s a component of lack of control at the surface but remember that you can control how much you talk about something. If they give you a hard time, walk. You control the environment. If they ignore your boundaries, walk. \n\nAt first, I kinda just talked clinical to my therapist and said \u201cyeah there\u2019s a lot of stuff to go through. Here\u2019s the rundown [insert basic labels of trauma I went through]\u201d ask them to be upfront, is this something they can help you with? If not, do they have recommendations for other therapists that can? If they make a big deal about it, walk. You don\u2019t want their help or anyone they recommend. In fact, you can thank them in your mind because they weeded themselves out for you. \n\nI was upfront since the first meeting and I said what I was able to talk about first and other areas I would need help in eventually but wasn\u2019t quite there to discuss yet. You are your own best advocate and it\u2019s your therapists\u2019 job to meet you at your starting line. I\u2019m still in the process of opening up to my own therapist s year into this. About two weeks ago was the first time I was able to mention a very common and normal topic. I didn\u2019t even realize it would make me SO emotional to talk about but I had to remember that the reason I hadn\u2019t brought it up before is because my brain has been damaged so much that* that not talking about it is my defense mechanism. I think that\u2019s actually kinda cool because my brain noticed a pattern and then said this thing was a topic that couldn\u2019t be discussed, in fact, it didn\u2019t even matter, this issue is actually a nonissue! I have consciously made the decision to protect my brain from itself and it\u2019s natural instincts. I\u2019m here, I\u2019m in control, and I\u2019m ready to unlearn a lot of problematic coping skills and replace them with productive ones. \n\nDo you know why you don\u2019t want to open up to them? There could be a lot of reasons, I just wanted to share mine because I feel like it\u2019s pretty common. You can message me (if my settings allow? Idk) if you want.\n\nEdit: I had a gummy and can\u2019t type",

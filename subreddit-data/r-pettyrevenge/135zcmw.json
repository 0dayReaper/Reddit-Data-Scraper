    "postText": "So this is the story how Prime Minister (PM) of Bangladesh took her petty revenge on WorldBank (WB).\n\nSo back in 2014, WB backed out of a proposed lending to Bangladesh for the amount of 1.25 Billion USD to use on Padma Multi-purpose Bridge, one of the largest infrastructure project in South Asia. This was due to an allegation of corruption between Bangladesh in high officials and SNC-Lavalin. However, even though these allegations were later dismissed by Canadian court, SNC-Lavalin\u2019s home nation. \n\nSo, because WB backed out of financing, Bangladesh went on to finance the bridge themselves, completing it in 2022. \nNow PM of Bangladesh  has gifted a painting of the completed Padma Bridge  to the President of WB. \n\nThis is as petty a revenge as it gets! \n\nLinks in first comment",

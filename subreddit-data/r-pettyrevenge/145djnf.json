    "postText": "This happened when our oldest (now in her 20s) was a baby. \n\nI was laid off from my job 2 days before I gave birth to our first child. Believe me when I tell you, it was financially rough, but the five months that I had at home with her were pretty awesome. \n\nI breast-fed both of our children (this is not a pro or con breastfeeding post so don\u2019t come for me) and felt that as long as I was covered, I could feed my child anywhere I wanted to. I breast-fed in malls, restaurants, church, doctor\u2019s offices, you name it. And yes, this is not the only Karen story I have about breast-feeding. But this is one of the funniest.\n\nSo picture it, it\u2019s a beautiful fall afternoon and my daughter and I have headed to the park to go for a walk. But just as we arrive, my daughter decided that she was a little peckish. I pulled her out of her car seat, climbed into the passenger seat, roll down the windows, and started feeding my kid.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time I had found myself in the car feeding my kid so I had a stack of magazines that I would pull out to thumb through while my kid ate. I should mention that my kid was a sipper so breast-feeding took a minute.\n\nNow I had parked my van so the front was facing a copse of trees. To see in my window, you had to walk over to the van. I was trying to be respectful and park in the shade. Okay, mostly the shade part.  \n\nWe had been sitting there for awhile before I hear \u201cahem\u201d outside my window. I look up and there is this stern woman glaring at us. The woman, let\u2019s just call her Karen, proceeds to tell me that I am sexually assaulting my child by breast-feeding her. Say what now?\n\nI was completely stunned, and as I was trying to come up with a response, DD pulls herself off of my breast and blows a raspberry at Karen. DD wasn\u2019t making a comment. She was just trying to clean out the extra milk in her mouth, but it was funny as hell to see this woman shocked face when my kid can basically spit at her for insulting her mom. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I said after that, it probably was something along the lines of what she said, but I do remember laughing my ass off as Karen walked away.\n\nDon\u2019t come for my kid, she\u2019ll get you every time.\n\nEdited to clean up typos.\n\n2nd edit: to say why I made the first edit cause apparently I\u2019m a moron. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

They just need something to be angry at all the time and while that makes them toxic and sometimes even dangerous to be around, it's still quite sad to see them fall prey to that addiction. Plus, our media and politics encourages it and takes advantage of them for it, and they're too focused on being angry to see it, which is also sad too.",

Baby and everything were nicely covered with a light blanket.  \n\nMIL's friend looked alarmed, stood up and quickly left the room.  MIL followed.  I sat there all alone.  \n\nLater MIL chastised me.  \"Didn't you notice how \\[friend\\] left the room!?  You made her so uncomfortable!!!!  WE ARE OLD-FASHIONED!\"\n\nI could only reply, \"There is **nothing** MORE *\"old-fashioned\"* than actual breast-feeding.\"\n\nShe replied that \\*they\\* never did such a thing and they don't care to see it either.\n\nMIL always bugged us to hurry and come back to visit.  She never understood that she made every minute of such a visit horribly uncomfortable.    \"Old fashioned\" indeed!",

The prevalence of allergies and the prevalence of formula and healthcare allowing a mother to survive a C-section isn't a coincidence.\n\nSame with modern over-sanitization, yes it helps people die less from easily curable diseases but it also doesn't allow our immune systems to adapt from infections.\n\n[You're twice as likely to get asthma if born by c-section](https://www.rutgers.edu/news/hidden-reason-children-born-c-section-are-more-likely-develop-asthma) and [food allergies are far more common in children born in west with fewer parasites and pathogens due to basic hygiene being commonplace](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46302780)\n\nThe immune system is 'overactive' in people today because we don't have to deal with as many germs and parasites, where in countries with high prevalence of parasites they have next to no auto immune disorders in the population.\n\nThen there's the whole area of poo transfusions to help people develop healthy gut microbiomes due to having an abnormal microbiome either due to chemotherapy, antibiotics, allergies, etc.\n\nLiving in a sterilized society is a lot more dangerous than we think, but it's also a lot better than living in a society without basic hygiene.\n\nedit: It's not a coincidence since the 50s there has been huge advances in medicine around pathogens, yet auto immune disorders have risen 500%. It can't be purely explained by sampling bias as a lot of auto immune issues are pretty vicious and obvious to detect (shitting your pants after eating bread, dying after eating a legume or seafood or dairy) unlike something like 'minor' mental health disorders like adhd where more detection is the cause of increase in cases.",

It's about pheremones and hormones, which change drastically after puberty. Even if you are small, if you've gone through puberty and are an adult, a paedo won't be attracted to you because you smell and act like an adult.

I do it here with a type of quick-growing aspen (locally also known as 'popple') for use as building material and fence poles. If these trees are allowed to get old, they become soft and easily rotted, and prone to getting blown down in storms. Harvested young, however, they are quite useful.",

Familial bonds are a little weaker, and people tend to group according to life stages- so you have some people who never get exposed to children or think it's normal to live their lives without ever being around children or people with children. So seeing someone breastfeeding or taking care of an infant is out of the range of normal to them, so they don't understand. Add into that the commercialization of formula in past decades with the push that formula was *better*, and there's some older generations of women who think that the decision to breastfeed is impolite or trashy. Something that lower classes would do because they couldn't afford formula. So breastfeeding almost became to them a class signifier and something to look down on, for a certain generation of women.",

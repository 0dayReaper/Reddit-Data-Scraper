    "postText": "Sooo...\n\nBack in march i ordered a cute suitcase \ud83d\udc9c i'm going on a trip at the end of the month (may), but ordering on this website was the worse mistake i could make.\n\n1. The store lost my package: i could have understood if they had at last refunded me right away but despite the fact that they warned me ~ 1 month ago, \n\nThe store themselves said they couldn't refund me without a dispute open. But i couldn't open a dispute for weeks and they basically held my money hostage since then. \n\nI needed a suitcase for my trip so i had to order elsewhere before they refunded me and that put me financially in the red... But what can you do.\n\n2. Once i FINALLY could open a dispute the seller countered my claim for a refund of 0.01$ instead of a full refund of 100$.\n\n3. DHgate itself doesn't allow me to ask for them to intervene until more time has passed so i'm locked again by the system\n\nThey have close to no moderation of the sellers and their costumer service is an AI so i got no help there\n\nI still haven't been refunded to this day\n\nMy petty revenge is that everyday that pass i leave a review of my experience on review websites (some of them censor me some go through)\n\nBut today i found out they have a \u2728reddit \u2728 so i left my review there (which was similar to this post \u2192 a step by step description of my experience)\n\nBut they banned mend spite my review not being objective and without a single swear word \ud83d\ude44\n\nBut i'm so salty i want people to know how awful their services are\n\nThis post itself part of my petty revenge \n\nThank you for reading me and shop safe yall \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcb8",

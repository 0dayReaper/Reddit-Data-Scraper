    "postText": "I grew up in the 1960s and 70s in Houston, Texas. In my early to mid teen years, I was very much into art. Sculpting, painting, drawing, etc. One afternoon I was puttering around in the garage and found five small cans of enamel paint. They were the three primary colors plus white and black. I took those cans and set about reproducing the wizard on an album cover for a popular band on the inside of my bedroom door. It actually turned out much better than I expected and I had an approximately 3 foot, (1 meter) full color painting. It was just the figure though, I hadn't gotten around to the waterfalls or the tree in the surrounding landscape yet, because I ran out of paint, so I left it to finish later. One thing led to another though and a teen mind with a bit of ADHD is easily distracted so it didn't get finished.\n\nAnother project that I started around the same time was a cactus garden. I chose the southeast corner of the back yard to begin my garden. I prepared an area about 12 feet long and three broad against the fence dividing our yard from our neighbor's. I planted all kinds of succulents like kalanchoes, hen n chicks, barrel cacti etc. Because it's a native plant, I also included a very small bit of prickly pear in the mix. Some plants did better than others. The kalanchoes did well as long as they didn't freeze but most of the cacti struggled. The soil in southeast Houston isn't especially sandy and it doesn't drain well. But the one that did best, by leaps and bounds was of course the prickly pear. It could handle rain or sunshine, brutal heat or freezing temperatures. It thrived.\n\nAs they have a tendency to do, my 18th birthday came around and it had me eager to test my freedom so I almost immediately leased an apartment with a friend and moved out. Fast forward a couple of years and my parents sold the house and moved to better digs. As soon as I heard, I conceived a desire to finish my door wizard so I headed back to the old homestead and went to ask the new owners if they still had the door. They said that they did but had painted over it. Importantly, they had painted over it with latex paint, which I was sure I could strip off fairly easily. I offered to buy the door and to go to the hardware store down the road and get a new door and mount it in its place. \n\nThe new owner adamantly refused every offer that I made. I guess that I get it, they didn't know me or that I was perfectly capable of doing what I offered to do. I thanked them and headed for the front door. As they were walking me out, the man asked if I knew how to get rid of the cactus in the back yard. I asked to see it and when we got back around the side of the house, my prickly pear was now as large as a medium sized truck tire and about a meter tall. He said that he had cut it down a couple of times but that it kept coming back. Getting an evil idea, I told him that he should hack it up and run over the remains with a lawnmower a few times. Now anybody who knows anything about the plant knows what's coming.\n\nFast Forward again to 1991. I had just gotten out of the Navy and I was doing some visiting in the old hometown. I had a friend who still lived almost directly across the street from my old house and I finally beheld it in all its glory; a dense jungle of prickly pear 5 feet tall and filling the entire space between the two houses. You see when you chop up a prickly pear, especially in a wet, warm climate, each of those pieces will root and make another prickly pear, plus the old root system is still alive and more cacti will spring up from that as well. It looked like they had long ago given up mitigation efforts and surrendered to that hardy, fast growing pestilence. Part of me still feels guilty but the part that remembers my unfinished wizard still smiles at the thought. Enjoy your door!",

    "postText": "My first IT job was for a small MSP. The company was overall friendly and I loved our clients but the CTO was a grade A douche to everyone. He\u2019d lose his temper and lacked a general understanding of social norms. For instance, my first year at the company Christmas party I\u2019d forgotten to bring a gift but I remembered on the 2nd. The CTO had walked up to and said \u201cOh, you decided to bring a gift this time\u201d. He\u2019d also bring up \u201cOh why are you still single? Didn\u2019t you meet anyone in college?\u201d\n\nAfter 3 years with that company I left to find a better opportunity but still kept in touch with some of my old coworkers. I had heard through the grapevine that the CEO didn\u2019t like him either and had given him goals to reach. He didn\u2019t accomplish a single one and was let go from the company but was still a stakeholder. He had to sell his house as he couldn\u2019t afford to live there anymore. The icing on the cake? He had been let go a week before his anniversary with the company but he never updated his job on LinkedIn. Of course I liked the post and commented \u201cCongratulations on 26 years with the company!\u201d",

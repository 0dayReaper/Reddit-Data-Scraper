    "postText": "This happened at a 24-hour gym in Hong Kong. Since the gym is only staffed for limited hours, the gym goers are expected to do the cleaning and replace the weights after each use of the equipment. This is even written in the terms and conditions. Nonetheless, some of us slip on this rule once in a while, some because they are too exhausted and forgets to do so, while some are just lazy. Usually a reminder from fellow gym members would suffice to make things right.\n\nBut there came a group of foreigners with two blonde guys and an Asian girl a little more than a week ago. They didn't replace the weights correctly. The plates were randomly arranged on the rack, even though there are numbers on each bar to indicate what weight should be placed there. \n\n'The weights need to be replaced correctly,' I reminded them in a friendly voice while helping them restore the positions of the weights.\n\nThey nodded and went to the next machine, and I resumed my workout. \n\nThe next day, the same group showed up again while I was working out, and they picked a chest press bench just in front of me. A couple of minutes later, they left the chest press bench in a mess and went to the dumbbell zone. \n\n'Hey guys! The weights have to be replaced correctly,' I said with a sterner face as I walked to them. \n\nThe tall blonde guy, let's call him Larry, replied, ' Do you work here?' \n\n'No, but-' I said, but was soon interrupted by Larry with a victorious smirk, 'Then have a nice day.'\n\n'It's common courtesy to-' I tried to reason, but Larry kept dismissing me with 'Have a nice day'. I saw them laughing as I walked away. Maybe they were confident that no staff members would tell them off because most of our fellow citizens barely speaks English. Plus it is not staffed at the time of our workout so there is no way to get a staff member to talk to them. \n\nTwo days later, I went to the gym a bit late and didn't see Larry's group. It was then staffed. I walked into the staff room and there was John and working on some paperwork. I waited until John finished the document he was working on. \n\n'How may I help you?' asked John plainly. \n\n'There were a group of people that didn't replace the weights. I told them to but they wanted a staff member to talk to them,' I shrugged. \n\n'Do you remember when and where they were working out?' To my surprise, I sensed a hint of eagerness, if not excitement, in John's voice. I didn't anticipate they would be willing to deal with these seemingly minor issues. \n\n'Two days ago, around 11:30 at the chess press bench, ' I replied quickly. \n\nJohn made a few quick taps on the computer, looking through the security cameras throughout the gym. A few moments later, he showed me a footage on the computer featuring Larry's group.\n'Is this the group?' John asked. The eagerness in his voice could hardly be missed this time. \n\n'Yes,' I replied.\n\n'Thank you so much! We will identify their identity from the membership data and asked the chain they registered in to send them an official reminder,' John said, 'It has been a headache for us to keep having to replacing the weights for these people.'\n\nI never see Larry's group again at the gym after that day. \n\nTL;DR: A group of foreign gym goers dismissed my reminder of replacing the weights because I did not work there. Have them reported to the staff and they got a documented official reminder. The group disappeared from the gym ever after.\n\nEdit: silly typo",

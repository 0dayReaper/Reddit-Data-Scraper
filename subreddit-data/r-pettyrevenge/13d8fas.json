    "postText": "Bored kids at a slumber party in the late 1980s. Of course you had to go to a video store for a movie, no internet, cassette tapes only. To0 old for My Little Ponies or Transformers, too young to have crushes.   \nWhat's a host of a slumber party gonna do? I know PRANK CALLS! YEAH! (This is before Caller I.D. or \\*69.)\n\nSo we pull out the White Pages (google it, fetuses) and call kids from our class and say a fake name is looking to talk to them (usually the name of a friend of theirs). Then say important things like \"FUCK YOU TAMMY!\" when their mom got them on the phone. You know, quality entertainment. It was anonymous reverse bullying as we were the nerds in our junior high.So we had an even better idea. Let's mess with the Operator. Hey, remember when we had to walk to school alone, made our own dinners and there was an actual living human being who would answer when you pushed 0 back in the day?So...we pushed \"0\" and got the operator and cursed at her. She was all \"ummm I have your number and I WILL call back in the evening tomorrow when your parents are home to let them know what you are up to\"\n\nWe were all \"GASP\" and had paranoia about every phone call for weeks.Best revenge on some little shits. We never did it again.  \nEdited for typo",

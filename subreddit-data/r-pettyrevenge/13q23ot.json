    "postText": "Back in my college days I had a couple of roommates. For the most part we got along fine, we even still occasionally talk. However, one of them kept rather odd hours and would frequently be up all night and then sleep most of the day.\n\nMost of the time it wasn't a big deal, they'd just be on web forums all night or researching some bizarre topic or another. However, every once in awhile they'd get it in their head to play like a Soviet era opera rather loudly at around 2-3am. Of all the reasons/ways to be woken up at 2-3am, I can think of several that rank higher than that.\n\nAfter being woken up most every night for several days running, I decided to make sure it couldn't happen again. I had an old computer sitting around, so I installed Linux on it and then set up the Squid proxy server. If you don't know what that is, don't worry, the only important part for the purposes of this story is that it allowed me to throttle the bandwidth on the roommate's computer. I set it up so that they shouldn't have any problems downloading web pages, but if anything over about 3-5MB (such as an MP3 file) would get slowed down to the point it was effectively stalled. Never again was I awoken to the sounds of Soviet operas or similar bits of music.",

I get flunking out of school because you spend too much time fucking and partying and fucking some more, but to flunk our doing something that you can do at home and not pay tuition for would be the worst",

It didn't, unless you count being put on academic probation that meant he couldn't enroll again for at least a semester, as working out.",

I would've been fuming and banging on their door telling them to turn that shit off if I was ever woken up at that hour. Good for you for keeping your cool and finding a better solution to sort this problem out \ud83d\ude0a",

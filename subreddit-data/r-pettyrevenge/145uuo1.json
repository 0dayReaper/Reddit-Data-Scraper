    "postText": "Not sure if this falls under petty revenge exactly. \n\nMy roomie drinks a blend of chocolate powder in his milk daily and I\u2019ve had a spoonful or two once in a while when he offered it. \n\nAround last Christmas he accused me taking some by myself and not telling him because the choco powder level \u201cseemed a little low\u201d. I explained to him I\u2019ve never taken any unless he\u2019s offered. \n\nHe asked me the same question a little after new years again and a third time few days after that. \n\nI was so annoyed that I bought a large packet of that choco powder and I  hid it in my closet. Since I sleep much later than he does, every night I put a scoop of powder from my secret bottle into his (hence replacing the daily dose he\u2019s consumed). \n\nSo for the past 5 odd months, the level of powder in the bottle has remained the same and even though he hasn\u2019t mentioned anything, it\u2019s\nVery fun to watch him feel annoyed once in a while at the lack of depleting levels of powder in his bottle.  \n\nLol.",

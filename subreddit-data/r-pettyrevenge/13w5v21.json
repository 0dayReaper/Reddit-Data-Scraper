    "postText": "The original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/13u0cvt/neighbors_son_gets_memorial_day_revenge/). Brief recap, Garth quit work and plotted an act of petty revenge on his Karen boss that was due to come to fruition yesterday (Memorial Day).\n\nI spoke with Garth about an hour ago. No surprise, he learned of my original post from friends who peruse Reddit and recognized the circumstances. Garth said he started receiving phone calls from his old job at about eleven that morning and throughout the day. He ignored them all. A person from corporate HR eventually sent him a text requesting an exit interview, \"in order to get his final paycheck.\" Garth replied, declined the interview, and informed them he expected to receive his final paycheck in a timely manner as required by law.\n\nIn hindsight, I was wrong to create the original post without first clearing it with Garth. I apologized to him but he was not upset about it. I said I'd delete it if he felt it would cause him issues, but he's not worried.\n\nFor those of you (and there are more than a few) who declared what Garth did was illegal, the key elements in our state for his petty revenge email to be illegal were not breached. I'm not going to post how he was able to access her email, but at least one comment that speculated how he did it was 100% accurate. Let's just say Karen is not very smart.\n\nGarth has not reached out to any former co-workers to find out what, if anything, has happened to Karen. He doesn't really care. He only hopes he caused her at least a small amount of stress and embarrassment.\n\nAnd that's it. Anticlimactic? Yeah. Is it over? Don't know.\n\nOh, and Garth liked the moniker I gave him. He said to tell everyone to party on. He starts his new job Thursday. Wish him luck.",

    "postText": "I come from a family of 6: my parents, my older sister, my older brother, my little brother, and me. Often, in order to bribe us into good behavior, our parents would buy us our favorite candy to munch on in the car. Now, I've never exactly been a giving person, not huge on sharing just for the sake of sharing. My parents, however, were trying to raise respectful and generous kids, and often forced me to share things even when I didn't want to. \n\nThat's all fine and good, except that my sister abused this system. See, she would say she didn't want a bag of candy, then once we were on the road she'd start taking candy from all three of the brothers. That really pissed me off. I didn't get candy often, as my mom didn't like feeding us sugary food, so when I got my own bag of Sour Patch Watermelon I wanted to eat every last one myself. Besides, my parents would always offer to buy her a bag of candy for herself, she would just refuse because she knew she could leech off the rest of us. So after a point I started refusing her requests for candy. But that shit didn't fly with my mom, because that was being selfish, so she would force me to hand over the candy. One time I even said when I purchased my bag at CVS, \"*sister*, I'm not going to give you any of my candy. If you want sour patch, buy your own right now.\" \"I'm fine,\" she responded, \"I don't want a whole bag of candy.\" Fast forward 20 minutes into the car ride, my father was requisitioning a candy to give to my sister, as I sat fuming. \n\nThis went on for years. My whole life, really. And I hated it. I would hide my candy when I got it, I would try and keep it out of her reach, but always a parent would intervene. \n\nFast forward to my sister's college graduation. She is now 22, I am a senior in high school at this point, and we're up at her school at a fancy ass restaurant celebrating after she had graduated that morning. In attendance are all immediate and some extended family, some close friends of my sister, and her long term boyfriend who I was meeting for the first time. \n\nSo, enough people for the following to be embarrassing to my family. \n\nOur meal ends and my mother offers to buy a nice dessert for anyone who wants it. My brothers, my dad and I all take her up on it. I ordered a vanilla bean cheesecake with a burnt sugar birds nest on top. My mother repeatedly offers to buy my sister anything she wants, but my sister says she couldn't possibly eat a full dessert right now, and turns it down every time. \n\nThe food arrives, and everyone is staring at mine. I'm sitting right at the head of the table in full view of everyone, so it's hard not to look, and aside from the cake slice being large and delicious looking, the burnt sugar birds nest is huge and ornate, hollow on the inside like a fucking old timey brass globe or some shit. Honestly, it was pretty impressive. \n\nAnd right as the food gets placed in front of us, my sister says, \"I'll just have a bite of everyone's\"\n\nAt this point, I'm seeing red, having flashbacks to all the times my food has been stolen. Logically, the right thing to do would've been to just hand over one bite. I mean, it was her graduation, it was a huge cake, it would've been no loss. But it had become a matter of principle. \n\nSo, the moment she says this, in one fell swoop, in full view of everyone at the table, I sweep up my slice of cheesecake and stuff the entire thing into my mouth at once, shattering the sugar nest, crumbs falling everywhere, in front of my whole family and some college students close to my sister who, again, never met in my life. \n\nMy sister stares, appalled, and says, \"Did you do that just so I wouldn't get any?!?\"\n\nAnd I look at her, cheeks ballooning out like a chipmunk, face covered in cheesecake and graham, dead in the eyes and nod. \n\nThere was a fair bit of shocked silence, at that moment and in the very tense car ride home. But to this day she never asks for anything from me anymore. \n\nTL;DR sister always steals my desserts, so I shoved an entire piece of cake in my mouth in front of strangers and family alike to prevent her from getting any\n\nEDIT: my first gold! Damn I should stuff my face with cake more often\n\nEDIT 2: Hi Shawnmug",

My little brother had polished his bag off completely before we even left the house, and I had picked my way around a few treats leaving my favourite candy until the end: tootsie fruit rolls. Of course seeing this, my 6 year old brother wanted to have some. I politely told him he ate his already, and that I was saving these for later. He caused such a scene that my mom turned around and asked me nicely if I would share with my brother. Enraged by his manipulation of mom, I rolled down the window (hooray for crank windows!), made eye contact with my brother, and casually tossed my candy bag out the window. No tootsie fruit for me? No tootsie fruit for you. He didn\u2019t like that very much, neither did Mom, but she knew why. ",

It was to appease a selfish whiner, probably one that threw a fit if she didn't get what she wanted.\n\nThat's the issue is that some parents, like the ones in this story, are lying to themselves. They are being selfish, not wanting to deal with teaching someone consequences, and instead just foisting it on to the siblings to appease someone. I respect when real sharing happens, like you only have one of a certain toy (like an Xbox or something) and parents insist on equal access for siblings to teach them that ya, in life you don't always get to have everything you want.\n\nThat's not what's going on in a case like this, it is teaching one child they get whatever they want at the expense of others and making the other kids pick up the slack for their lack of will to parent.",

One morning I'm making instant grits while my brother is crying and he then decides that's what HE wants for breakfast too, but I had the last package. My mom demanded that I give it to him to shut him up. It was just so unfair that I dumped that package of instant dry grits into his fresh-from-the-shower wet hair.

I wouldn't pitch a screaming fit or ask for anything unreasonable, but I'd definitely make it known I wasn't happy when I was told no. My mother would always give in and give me what I wanted, too.    \n\nNow, I wish I'd never been allowed to act like that, and especially resent the fact I used to be rewarded for it. I have behavioral issues, like being told no will irritate me in most situations. I'll start being passive-aggressive without even realizing it's happening, or question the person as to why they said no.  \n  \nI didn't learn that it was disrespectful to question a person's/your parents' decision until I was twelve. I learned differently when the only friend I had asked her mom if I could come stay the night, and her mom said no. I asked my friend why. She said she didn't know and couldn't ask because she'd get into trouble for questioning her mother's decision. It didn't make sense to me, ~~but I dropped it~~ so I ended up begging and pestering her to ask her mother for a reason.     \n  \n\nFortunately, I have a wonderfully patient partner. He will kindly tell me if I'm being passive-aggressive, then say what it was I was trying to convey in a gentler, friendlier tone. It's a work in progress, but I'm not as bad as I used to be. I'm so lucky to have you, u/RadialMeteorMusic.  \n  \n  \n  \n\n&gt; **TL;DR** : Parents, please don't spoil your kids for the sake of not having to put up with their fits. I know how tempting it is (I'm a parent myself), but it can have lifelong effects and hinder them in achieving/maintining relationships of any kind. It can also make it difficult for them to audibly articulate thoughts and feelings without hurting someone in the process.  \n  \n**Edit:** Apparently I suppressed a part of the childhood memory. Typing it out and reading back over it made me remember what actually happened. Bizarre.",

I gave him hell about how this was the only thing I could eat, he could and did eat the rolls, the pasta, whatever he wanted, but no, he couldn't let me eat my little salad in peace but he HAD to have some. If we hadn't been eating there with our kids, I would have stormed out of the place and left him there.\n\nHe was so ashamed he never did it (to me) again...but he remains an inveterate stealer of my kids' fries, pasta, bread...ugh. I guess he sees it as a sign of intimacy, but I see it as a sign of disrespect and completely uncouth behavior.",

I grabbed his wrist and gave it a balls to the wall twist (hard enough he actually dropped his fork into my plate) and told him to keep his fork out of my fucking plate before I threw the whole thing at him.

I saved it for something special and held onto it for months. Finally a day came where we went to an awesome bowling alley with an arcade. I was a master at the claw game (yes I've won things) and started getting change from the change machine. My sister and 4 cousins were there as this was a family thing and I was the oldest of the group. I agreed with my mom to give everyone one dollar to have fun since I was feeling generous.\n\nWell when they ran out I was pestered relentlessly. Eventually my mom asked me to give them more and I was appauld. I broke out into a hysterical crying after she yelled at me to share. I yelled in public how it was my money that I saved and I was nice to share. But I won't play anymore in the arcade cause of the whining. \n\nShe came to me later after I came out if the bathroom to apologize and tell me that I was right after speaking to my dad and told me to go play. It was ruined at that point but it felt good to be understood. ",

I have a pile of relatives who would have their hands out in an instant to demand a share because they're \"unlucky\" - yeah, unlucky in getting fired for failing drug tests, fired for talking back at work, choosing to quit college a semester before graduating, etc.  Their supposed poverty isn't 'bad luck'.  It's the end result of a series of bad decisions (refusing to sacrifice today in exchange for future rewards, lack of self control, etc.) piling up over time.\n\nBut because it looks bad to be the 'bad guy' who has to say NO, I just avoid the whole thing by making them think I'm no better off than they are.  I've been driving the same car for 23 years, while they've been through easily 5+ cars each.  And any time I DO feel sorry for a relative who has been through legitimate hard times, I make sure that nobody learns that I helped, so I don't attract financial parasites.\n",

It would be better to do it when your sister isn't in the room.  I would not recommend doing it in the moment because your parents may be telling you to share because they are trying to avoid a meltdown from your sister or are otherwise tense.  \n\nCalmly explain to your parents how frustrated you feel when your sister does this and why it makes you feel that way.  Explain to them why it makes you feel so frustrated when they force you to share with her (eg. she declined a bag of candy earlier when your parents offered to buy one for each of you).  Let them know that you are happy to share sometimes, but that you are frustrated by being forced to share so often solely because your sister didn't plan ahead and you did.  Mention that you'd be more willing to share if you were forced to do it less often.  The most important thing is that you stay calm and clearly communicate to your parents how it makes you feel and why (and act mature).   \n\nThis is a bit of a long shot, but it might also be worth calmly talking to your sister.  Perhaps she doesn't realize how frustrating this is for you or maybe she just genuinely never thinks she wants a treat until she sees how yummy yours looks.  ",

What I mean is I'm sure that if his sister doesn't get what she wants, she throws a fit, whines constantly, or in some other way makes herself a pill to deal with. Now the right answer, of course, is for the parents to be parents: To suffer though it, to teach her that her actions have consequences and she has to deal with them. But they are selfish, they don't wanna do that, so it is easier to just make the siblings pick up the slack. Make them give her what she wants so they don't have to deal with it.\n\nI had friends with parents like that, who would force them to give up shit to the crybaby kid under the guise of \"sharing\" because they didn't want to be bothered to deal with the tantrum. I also had a friend who legitimately had to share alot with his brother because his family was fairly poor and they didn't have much but the sharing went both ways. It was the sort of thing that he and his brother would get communal gifts: This doesn't belong to one of you but to both of you and you have to share.",

So many rides back from my grandmother's house were spent in silence because my younger sister would throw a tantrum if the radio was turned on at all, no matter what station (most of the time she would claim she had a headache as soon as she got into the car).  She also, to this day, refuses to stop singing when I politely ask her to (she likes to do it for long periods of time and repeat things) on the grounds that I never stop when she asks me to.  This lead to my creation of the song \"[sister's name] is annoying,\" with that as its only lyric, which inevitably she would get super upset about, and I'm still a little annoyed that she never saw the irony in it.  \n\nShe would also refuse to listen to her music (or Harry Potter audiobooks) with headphones or earbuds on the grounds that both hurt her ears and she liked to spend all her time on the computer right at the top of the stairs, which meant that whatever she was playing could be heard from literally everywhere else in the house.",

If they say they don't want something, they don't get it. Complain you aren't hungry and don't want dinner because you don't like what I'm cooking? Guess what, you can go to bed hungry and eat breakfast in the morning. Say you don't want a treat in the car? You don't get one and I will happily (or spitefully as the case may be) turn up the music do drown out the wails of grief and rage when I say no until it stops.\n\nIn a nutshell, I really try to say what I mean and mean what I say, and expect the same from my children.

I have an ex-girlfriend, who is still a good friend of mine, but man \u2013 she has this amazing way of making things about HER in a manner that most people don\u2019t see. I\u2019ve been close to her for 30 years, and I\u2019ve seen it in so many situations. For example: she had this nasty tendency of making everybody wait for her if she shared a ride to an event with a group of people. It routinely would get to be ridiculous. My favorite story of this is she went to a concert with a few friends of ours, and after the show, she insisted on getting into a long conversation with one of the bandmembers. My friend who drove kept telling her that he was ready to go, and finally, when he told her he was leaving, he did exactly that: leaving her in a different city to figure out how to get home. It was beautiful.",

Part of me wonders how she made it through university like that, and a small, spiteful part of me wonders if she even earned her degree or if she just bummed answers off people and let everyone else carry group projects. Hate me for this or don't, but from the small window your story has provided into your sister's life, I kind of hope she's far enough gone to find herself in over her head and crashes and burns once she discovers that she can't take a bite of her neighbors' rent checks or get the answer to question 23 from the engineer in the next cubicle.",

Every single adult in my immediate AND extended families has tried to force this onto the kids. I have a lot of cousins and siblings around my age. We all have been yelled at to give our stuff away for no fucking reason at all, and it especially pisses me off because everyone else had a chance to get the same shit for free.",

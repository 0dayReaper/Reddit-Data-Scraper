    "postText": "Long time lurker, first time poster. \n\nI work as an operational engineer in a process industry.  My former manager was a bully, she was harsh,  intimidating and wielded fiercly the small amount of authority her role gave her.  She had me performance managed at one stage unreasonably. I was very much downtrodden and unable to stick up for myself.  All other managers were too weak to assist so i just got into a bad mental health state and burnt out many times.  Aside from her i loved the job so i stayed.  \n\nAside from being horrible she also was dating the manager of a major contractor we used.  This was declared through executive management and it was ensured she wasn't able to directly decide on using them for work.  \n\nShe did however have access to view contract bids, her bfs company would bid last and just under the others as a result getting the job.  This happened for years without her manager doing anything directly. She also made me \"request\" work from the company for her so it appeared she wasn't involved. \n\nShe ended up being forced to move site and had a run in with a friend and tried to get him fired. So in response he reported her to the integrity department for the fraud above.  They contacted me for evidence as my name appeared in places.  Now here is the revenge that is probably minor in context.  Because she was so horrible i proceeded to spend many hours of my own time going through emails over years to get evidence.  Others did too for similar reasons. Because i was performance managed and benefited in no way i wasn't looked at from a fraud perspective \n\nShe ended up getting two options either investigated by corruption police or quit without references. She left and now works in the middle of no where for a private company,  my company has a monopoly so she's basically stuck.  \n\nWorkplace is much better and turned out well.  Horrible few years though",

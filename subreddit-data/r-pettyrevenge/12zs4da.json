    "postText": "I got divorced back in 2019.  My ex husband, who for this story will be referred to as Baby Huey, is the *chef's kiss* perfect example of failure to launch.  The whole 5 yrs we were together he had no job.  After almost a year together I lost my shit and tried to dump him, it ended up0 with him finally applying to our local community college.  He couldn't work part-time AND do school full-time, but he could bitch when I didn't have the money to take us out to dinner and a movie.  I feel I should add that I was working 3 jobs and in nursing school at the time.  Nursing school probably would have been easier if I wasn't playing mommy to a grown ass man.  You live, you learn, you get divorced. \n\n\nMy state has a 6 month waiting period between filing for divorce and finalizing it. Shortly after we separated, he texted saying he missed me.  I echoed the sentiment and followed up telling him we should have a recommitment ceremony and we could adopt kids (thought I couldn't have them).  He got excited and then I said I would rather light my public hair on fire than ever get back together with him and to \"go give your balls a tug, titfucker\" (I'm a big Letterkenny fan).\n\nSeven months after our divorce, when I was day drinking and feeling salty I exacted my revenge.  I got on Craigslist and made a posting in a town near us on their free page.  It was for 5 laying hens.  I included his phone number and said to call or text.  The ad was up less than 3 hours before I started getting emails saying the phone number was disconnected.  He was so frustrated he went and changed his phone number.",

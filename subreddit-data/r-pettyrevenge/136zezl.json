    "postText": " Years ago, I worked for a large manufacturing company in my hometown. If you have food, cleaning products, or paper products in your home, it was probably made by this company.  I was also pregnant. Most of the people I worked with were awesome. There were a couple of ladies who really took me in because this was my first child, and I was 20 and hopelessly overwhelmed but, on the other hand, there were these 6 ladies who had it out for me. Not sure why. Don\u2019t know if it was jealousy or the fact that their uteruses had dried up years ago and spewed dust. Regardless of the reason these queen bees hated that I got to have a \u201ccushy\u201d job just because I was pregnant. (I didn\u2019t have a cushy job because I was pregnant. I got it because I excelled at the job and so the higher-ups gave me some extra responsibilities doing reports which took me off the line and into a chair a few hours a day.) \n\nA little background: There are three buildings on the top of a hill. Each building is side by side but their parking lots descend down the hill. Each building had its own designated parking areas. The parking lot for \u201cA\u201d building was right on ground level and mostly execs worked there. Lot \u201cB\u201d was a little lower down the hill and is where a lot of the chemists and labs doing research were housed. I had worked in B building several times before on other projects.  Building \u201cC\u201d was where most of the manufacturing happened and so needed more space than the other buildings. That is also why it was all the way down at the bottom of the hill and you had to walk up almost 200 stairsteps to get to the building. (I counted them once and I think it was 196 or 198 steps. This parking lot was affectionately called \u201cthe pit\u201d because it was so steep).  \n\nWhen I was about 7 months pregnant, I found the pit was becoming exceedingly difficult to manage with carrying the extra baby weight so I asked my supervisor if I could start parking in building B\u2019s lot. He had no problem with it, so I started parking there. Another month later the sweet ladies that I worked with threw me a baby shower on our lunch break. They hooked me up with everything that I could possibly need since I was working full time and going to school, I couldn\u2019t afford a lot of things. I mean they bought me big-ticket items like a crib, playpen, changing table, etc. I was in awe. Yes, I had a crib at 8 months, but it was used and old and probably under recall. They didn\u2019t trust it so bought me a new one. The supervisor bought me a bunch of diapers from the company store where he got a huge discount (see told you they make everything). At the end of the day, everyone helped carry the items down to my car (station wagon). That is when the 6 queen bees saw that I was parking in B lot instead of down in \u201cthe pit\u201d like everyone else. They started yelling at me about how I thought I was better than everyone else parking wherever I chose. That I better watch out because they were going to see to it that I got in trouble for breaking the rules and maybe even fired if they had their way. The other ladies told them to back off and shut up. God, I loved those ladies. They really did take care of me and taught me so much. \n\nI found out the next day that the queen bees did indeed take their case to the security office. Security called me in. I explained the supervisor told me I could park in lot B. Security explained that he (supervisor) did not have the authority to do so. That there were channels for exceptions, and he didn\u2019t follow them. That I would have to start parking down in the pit like everyone else. I was in tears when I returned to the floor. Queen bees were gloating. The other ladies asked what was wrong. I told them. They were much smarter than my 20-year-old self. They told my supervisor what had happened. He marched right down to the security office. Evidently, he simply had to apply for a medical exception on my behalf. By the end of the day, not only did I have a special placard for my car but, turns out, I got to park up in Building A\u2019s parking lot at the top of the hill right next to our building because, for medical exemptions, this is the one with handicap accessibility ramps. \n\nThe next day I made sure the queen bees saw me in my new parking space. By that I mean I waited for them to arrive and when I saw each of them walking into the building I laid on the horn and waved at each and every one of them with a huge grin. Fuck those harpies.",

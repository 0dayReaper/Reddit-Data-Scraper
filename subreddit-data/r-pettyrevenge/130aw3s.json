    "postText": "Some decades ago, I was in a college office and had a member of faculty who liked to treat me as their personal assistant. I was certainly *not*, but they were very comfortable pushing unreasonable deadlines (purposefully creating urgency to spur results and avoid questions), and directing any work possible onto anyone deemed \"below\" them.\n\nBecause this was a college, we used to get \"free\" textbooks in the mail all the time, and could request textbooks for consideration from the publisher (this was a time before everything was digital). The hope was that the book would be picked for a class, and the publisher could then sell the books that the students would need for class. Technically, books that weren't picked were supposed to be mailed back to the publisher, but that rarely happened, and no one got in trouble for keeping a book. \n\nOne day, the faculty approached me with requests for multiple textbooks that they \"wanted to consider.\" Dear readers, they did **not** want to consider those books. They wanted to rack up a stack of free texts that they could sell for a quick buck because no one would chase after \"free\" copies (side note: the cost of that \"free\" book eventually trickles down to students; it's a dick move all around). \n\nI knew what was happening but I placed all the orders as I was told; staying late because, *surprise!* Another deadline that was inflated. Then I waited. Not long, mind you, just long enough for them to make some sales and eventually select the *same book* they had used the last time they taught the course (no need to revise the curriculum that way). Oh, and of course they will need a new copy of the book they picked (and already had), so I need to order that ASAP. \n\nI replied: \"No problem, I'll get a fresh copy (of the book you have in your office) and work on returning all the books you didn't pick. Please bring them back to my office tomorrow.\" \n\nThe look of shock on their face was delightful. It confirmed that they had indeed sold at least some of the books. Better yet, it cornered them into *somehow* getting the books back, unless they wanted to be on the hook with the publisher or exposed for unethical activity (not really, mind you, but as I was the one communicating with the publishers, they didn't know that the same lax rules were still in play). \n\nThey tried to get out of it, asking if it was *really* necessary, asking about whether they could keep them for personal use, asking me to ask the publisher if they can keep them and consider for a different class... but *alas!* No, \"the publishers\" said that all the books needed to be returned right away.  \n\nI'm reasonably certain they ended up buying at least one \"like new\" copy to replace the brand new one received. I may not be faculty, but I can write a thesis on petty.",

Today they are run like businesses relying on the reputations and their faculty\u2019s efforts to draw funding. Pedagogy is their lowest priority, while marketing to teenagers and parents on the value of their education. Meanwhile undergraduates only desire the independence from their parents with little or no accountability. /RantOff",

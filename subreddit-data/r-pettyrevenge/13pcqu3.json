    "postText": "Someone once parked right in the sole turnaround spot on our tiny dead end street. I happened to be carrying some garlic bread, as one does, and in a fit of petty pique, I tucked a piece of garlic bread (garlic side down) under each windshield wiper on the offending vehicle.\n\nI felt a simultaneous rush of shame and pride. In the morning the car was still there but the garlic bread wasn't. \n\nI still wonder if maybe they just thought \"yay, garlic bread\" while I thought \"yay, petty revenge\" in an absurd win-win twist.\n\n\n\n*Here in Pittsburgh we have a lot of narrow rutted streets, dead ends, hills, and parking issues. We also refer to jerks as 'jags' 'jagoffs' or on rare occasions even 'jagalloons.' I've decided to adverb that gem as well, hence 'jagilly.)",

There were 2 spots big enough to park in the Alley., and that was were I generally parked.  These spots happened to be right behind a house that faced a Main Street.  said house actually had 2 driveways (even one driveway was rare in Etna, let alone 2) and there was never a car parked in either one.  One morning I got up to leave for work and there was a note on my car telling me to not park next to the home owner\u2019s curb.  I taped a huge note that the owner would be able to see from her kitchen saying \u201cget bent, this is not \u201cyour curb\u201d it belongs to the borough, and that it was a public alley as well as public parking\u201d",

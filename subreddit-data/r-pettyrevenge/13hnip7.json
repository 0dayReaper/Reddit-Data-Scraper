    "postText": "I work in an escape room. \n\nWe have a check-in lobby where we get customers' names and sell merch/photos. When we were working the lobby, we were often down there standing for hours with no customers around as they weren\u2019t very busy and when we did have customers the strict scheduling nature of the game meant we always knew when they would turn up for check-in and when they would be making their way out.\n\nEvery member of my team had asked for a stool to be placed behind the desk as it was extremely physically taxing on us to stand for hours on end. Management always said it was under consideration but a month ago we had a team meeting where they admitted that it wouldn\u2019t happen because 1) it looked unprofessional and 2) someone had complained about it once and at a different location.\n\nThe lobby had a drinks fridge. The drinks were all bought discounted for around 50p each and sold for \u00a32.50 each. The waiting area had a water cooler and each refill cost the company ~\u00a38.\n\nIn response to their refusal to give us a chair, whenever a customer came in and went to buy a drink before the game I made sure to inform them that there was complimentary water provided in the waiting area.\n\nI mentioned it in passing to a coworker who had put in their notice, and they started doing it too and eventually, most of us were doing it as we worked notices or job hunted.\n\nSome people still bought the drinks but most just put them away and drank the water upstairs. Which had to be refilled by management multiple times a day.",

Someone found the complaint and it wasn\u2019t even about the damn chair, it was that, while sat on it, they had lowered it so much that they weren\u2019t visible behind the screen while they used headphones and so the group waited around for like 15 mins and nearly missed their slot.",

One of the games he used a clue and then binned it cos he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d have to come back to it later. I went to do the whole sneak in and put it back thing but as I turned to leave it on the table he spun around, went \u201coh i need that\u201d just picked it out of my hand and went back to the game. No eye contact, no acknowledgment of someone randomly appearing in the room, nothing. We think he just didn\u2019t even realise I was there lol.\n\nAlso there are a lot more cameras and a lot more doors than you realise or could guess.",

    "postText": "I'm a single mom of a 2 year old, we currently live with my parents because I found out I was pregnant less than a month before the lockdown started. I don't have my license yet (work in progress) so my parents are our only mode of transportation. They bought plane tickets to go out of state for my cousin's graduation from June 2nd-5th, I wasn't able to get tickets for me and my daughter because I couldn't afford it. Well I asked my boss for those days off (on May 12th so there was plenty of notice) but she refused because \"it wasn't my vacation\" and \"there are Uber's with carseats\" (for context, I work at a preschool and she goes there with half tuition). I'm not comfortable putting my daughter in a stranger's car no matter who they are or how safe it is. My boss told me if I didn't set up transportation then I would be written up for a no call no show \ud83d\ude44\nCue the petty revenge; I told my parents how upset I was about this because I couldn't find a single solution that would appease my boss without sacrificing my boundaries and potentially putting my daughter in danger. So they bought us plane tickets on the condition that I pay them back with a little from each paycheck. I can't wait to tell my boss and show her the flight confirmation when she comes back to work tomorrow \ud83d\ude02\n\nUPDATE: I just got off work so I'm sorry for making y'all wait but my job is still intact! I spoke to my boss first thing this morning AND showed her the flight confirmation as well as telling her (thanks for that advice!) I won't be available those days. I was approved by the end of the day and my boss even told me to enjoy my trip! No repercussions, no write ups, no hard feelings. Thanks for everyone's input, opinions, and concerns \ud83d\udc95",

Not a bad deal tbh and I'm really excited to see my family again, we moved across country 8 years ago and I've only seen them a handful of times since",

You also don\u2019t need to volunteer that information. You will need these days off is all you need to say.  As long as it\u2019s in advance within whatever notice required it doesn\u2019t matter what the reason nor do you need to provide one for her to judge. You just learned it\u2019s actually better not to. \n\nBut secondly, you\u2019ve created a situation for yourself where you\u2019re overly dependent upon your parents at this stage in your life.  And because you\u2019re not fully independent, you\u2019re not fully empowered and therefore you\u2019re going to have to learn to flex on your boundaries. We live in a society that expects you to have transportation to work. It\u2019s up to you to figure that out and in this sense your boss is correct. It\u2019s not her problem but yours to get yourself to work. \n\nOnce you become more truly independent then you have more power to make up what your boundaries and your personal rules are and what your comfort zone can be but until then you\u2019re going to have to flex on things like taking an Uber. In other words, you are not in a position, nor can you afford to be so fussy with your \u201cboundaries.\u201d  Uber drivers are required to have good driving records. We all do what we have to do and you\u2019re acting like an entitled immature brat in your bosses eyes I\u2019m sure.  Lots to learn here, but I don\u2019t see your parents buying you a ticket that you can show off to your boss as a win for your personal growth and development.",

Then they would depend on friends, co-workers, roommates, etc. for rides. If they couldn\u2019t get a ride, many of them would think it was the casino\u2019s fault for taking issue with them not being at work. Ummm what?

I have two kids with two different models of carseat (same brand, both \"convertible\" carseats), and their height/weight restrictions are pretty different. For example, my 3-year-old can still sit rear facing, and doesn't seem to be outgrowing that any time soon, while my now 6-year-old basically had to be forward facing at 2 years old because he outgrew the height restriction. The rear facing height restrictions are like 6 inches of difference, it's crazy. And, there are weight restrictions for when a forward facing carseat needs to be installed with a seat belt vs with the anchor system. Similarly, different seats have different restrictions for whether you can use the 5-point harness or if you have to use the seat as a belt-positioning booster.\n\nIn OP's case, with a 2-year-old, I'd have no idea if the seat is safe for rear facing or forward facing without looking the model up. And what if rear facing isn't an option, because the seat is installed forward facing? And how do i prove that the seat is actually installed correctly? Should I be installing it myself just to be certain? How do I know that the Uber driver has followed the \"chain of custody\" with the carseat (i.e. no accidents, not expired, not stored in weather extremes)? So many people are completely unaware that there are rules on when a carseat must be disposed of.\n\nAll that being said, I don't think OP's only option is getting a ride with her parents. As you mentioned, the bus is an option, rides from someone else... Hell, maybe even her boss would do it.",

I couldn't drive for awhile, so I picked up more work hours to cover my Ubers and got my groceries delivered. Mom and Dad never went to the store for me or bought me plane tickets because my boss threw a shit fit.",

Your personal time is no concern of your employer.\n\nAll of that being said, \nBRAVO! Well played!",

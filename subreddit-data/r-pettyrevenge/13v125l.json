    "postText": "So, I don't know how petty this is but, I had to get this of my chest because IM SO PROUD!!!\n\nFor 15 years my mother was in an abusive relationship with my father on and off. She kept leaving him because of his abuse towards her and then he kept manipulating her to get back with him.\n\nMy mother was pregnant with her first child (Me!) And went to hospital as she went into labour. My mother has said medical condition which meant there was a 50/50 chance she could or couldn't die during child birth.\n\nI can tell this was a scary time for her. She told me that altogether the was a 20 people in the room all had different specialities. (Also we're British so very fortunate she didn't have to worry about paying for this).\n\nLabour is very painful itself but the medical condition she had would make child birth even more painful, due to this she had to have A LOT more pain relief. \n\nThis is where my mother decided that she would get her revenge. \n\nMy father arrived to the hospital 20 minutes after she got there. And I was the only birth he turned up for!\n\nMy mother pretended the pain relief wasn't working. My father reached out his arm and my mum grabbed his hand. Because the pain relief \"wasn't working\" she kept pushing his hand....\n\nUntil it broke!\n\nMy father had to go next door to a&amp;e to get it fixed. \n\nEvery time my mother told that story, right up until the night she died, she would say it with a smile and she was so proud of it!\n\nI've heard/witnessed a lot of pettiness but this beats them all.",

            "comment": "When I was interning as a medical doctor in the Obs department, I once assisted a short heighted primi on delivery. She was not descending (i.e. the baby wasn't coming down), and she was having really really painful contractions. Add to that that she was a primi and 20 years old, and she was in a lot of pain. \nWhere I am from, empathy isn't exactly the strong suite of obs delivery rooms. I used to make it a point to go and talk to these women (poor women in government hospitals) to try and calm them down and make the experience a little less horrid. So as I was talking to this lady, she grabbed onto my wrist and looked pleadingly. And had a contraction. \nI had (and still have) multiple pseudocysts on my body. These are essentially jelly filled sacs, and the easiest treatment is labelled the Bible treatment (smack it hard with a Bible leading to its rupture and dissolution). \nAt the time of this happening, I had a rather painful pseudocyst on my wrist. As this lady had a contraction, she grabbed and squeezed down on my wrist HARD. The cyst was ruptured. Suffice to say that even though momentarily in pain, I was really thankful, and have since then persisted in being as nice as I can with my patients. \n\nI also don't have labour room duties anymore.",

No I had an entrapped ulnar nerve but the doc was like \"look it's the same arm and will be a 1 inch incision. We'll cut it out, cauterize the stalk and the chance of it coming back reduces to 15%. I figured I was already going to be going under for the elbow surgery and it was the same arm so it's not like I'd be using my wrist much anyway. Had insurance that covered both surgeries 100% so I was like fuck it cut that bitch out. I miss having that insurance. Thanks obamacare. (Not sarcastically. I was 23 and still under my moms very excellent insurance that I was only allowed to be on because  the law said you could be on your parents insurance til 26)",

And I was warned it could come back.  Too bad you had to have surgery, but at least they found the real cause of the numbness and took care of it - and the cyst!  \n\nI know what you mean about good health insurance.  Since have been on Medicare, I have had multiple kidney stone surgeries and two cataract surgeries.  The surgeries cost me $250 each time and the medical care was excellent.  I just paid a fraction of what it would have cost if I still had major medical along with Medicare.",

But in reality,  once that sucker is in,  i wasnt allowed to labor in any position of my choosing.  Mostly because it's in your spine and because you go numb from the ribs down. The spinal tap in particular  causes you to lose complete feeling from ribs down. They made me keep trying to wiggle my toes during that c section with the tap to make sure it was working i guess? \n\nBut in my hospital they had a nurse in front of me and made me hunch over a pillow while she kept me from moving.  At one point i was face first in one nurses chest for the tap because she was working hard to not let me move. I've got a friend whos epidural was botched and shes got permanent back pain now.  She cant hold her kids on her hip because the pain is unbearable.\n\nPlus side is it certainly lets you sleep while contracting.",

The most uncomfortable thing was having to hunch over when you are the size of a beached whale. They also give you a lighter epidural. I couldn't feel the pain, but was still able to move.

She apparently didn't appreciate whatever he was saying so she took her left hand and close fisted him in the nose with like a sideways punch! So much blood!! Baby was coming so he didn't get too much attention just a towel throw his way and called for back up to help him. It was so hard not to laugh because it was so unexpected and he was in shock from it but then he was feeling some pain. She didn't apologize (at the time) and just looked at him with a death glare. Almost like I dare you to complain it hurts. I will never forget that!!!",

    "postText": "My next door neighbor when I was a young teen was the same age as my little sister. She danced in competitions and did some modeling for catalogs, nothing very special, but she bragged nonstop. When she wasn't bragging her parents were doing it for her. \n\nShe wasn't the nicest to my sister and while me and sis weren't exactly tight, she is my sister. \n\nSo I was walking to school one day and caught up and passed her and a gaggle of her girlfriends, they would have been in grade 7 or 8, I was in high school. \n\nAs I went past I said hi and kept going, she said something she and her girlfriends thought was hysterical. I can't remember what it was for the life of me. \n\nLet it go, or smack her down? Stupid question. I decided to hit her where it would hurt. \n\nHey Fiona,  are you pregnant? Or did you just get fat? I then turned and held walking, but not before I saw her face turn bright red, and the sound of the girls howling with laughter as I walked away was music to my ears. \n\nSorry, don't be mean to my little sister...",

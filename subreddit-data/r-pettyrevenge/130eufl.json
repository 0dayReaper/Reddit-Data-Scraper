    "postText": "Setting and Context matter, because even though this was an epic moment in my young life, as an adult I feel a bit bad about this. \n\nIn grade 5 I was living in a small pacific island. I was one of only two white kids in the village school, and so the fact that I stood out from the crowd visually combined with my small stature and mouthy nature made me an easy and frequent target of bullying. \n\nOne particular day we were heading out on the school bus to see an oyster hatchery. I was sitting in the row in front of a small Chinese girl (the only one in the school, likely as much a target of bullying, and probably less deserving of it than me). She was being encouraged by the girl next to her to do something to me, when all of a sudden I felt a warm goop on my shoulder.\n\nI looked over and saw a huge jiggling warm wet loogey on my shoulder. The Chinese girl had horked on me. I instantly felt like I was going to puke, and after a moment of listening to the two girls behind me laughing, turned around and vomited on both of them. \n\nNo one from that school ever spat on me again. We arrived a few moments later, and both girls were hosed down, and I was able to wash the loogey off my shirt. \n\nI still feel bit bad, because I'm sure that little girl was as bullied or more so than me, and was probably just trying the whole, \"Ill pick on the little guy to make myself look bigger\" think... Ah well, live and learn, Don't Spit on me.",

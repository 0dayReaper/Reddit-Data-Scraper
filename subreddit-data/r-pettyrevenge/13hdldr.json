    "postText": "This story is borderline [r/MaliciousCompliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/13fqji3/im_waiting_for_the_customer_boss/), but it's mostly about pettiness, TL:DR in the end.\n\nBeen in the same company for over ten years, started as an intern but grew to the high levels - not really a high rank, but I'd daily interact and I could easily chat with any top manager / director. Big old corporate, with a not-so-unusual \"not my problem\" attitude among the long time hires and lot of bureaucracy.\n\nAmong the employees, in our department we had a senior particularly fond of the \"not my problem\" phylosophy, let's call him Joe. Joe started as a system administrator, but he was doing nothing and would refuse to do so (he has even been investigated shortly after I started, he received a lot of complaints from literally every single one that had to work with him).\n\nAfter a few years I was hired, to push Joe working, management thought it was a good idea to move him to a higher-responsibility lower-skills position, making him a mandatory point of contact for either compliance or provisioning of anything (his job would be to forward your requests or assign you hardware / accounts). As well, Joe was moved manager a few times, since no one wanted to deal with that attitude.\n\nAnd then there is me. I needed services, hardware, compliance and so on for myself, my team, other business units and my clients (yeah, I worked with and for a lot of entities). I had to go through him so. many. times. All my requests were first going to him, and then I would very often had to re-route them through his manager in order to be served. Communications were so bad that they all were happening through emails (or any other traceable form) with both mine and his chain of management in cc, because I couldn't be bothered anymore with all the deflection of responsibilities.\n\nTo cite an example, when GDPR was being implemented (May 2018), I had to get him to approve the services I had online for our clients as GDPR compliant. I had an email trail of one year asking for updates about it without any answer. The guy did nothing, as usual. 17th May, few days before the legal enforcement, Joe implied on an email that my services couldn't be online anymore because of my lazyness in not wanting to make them secure. I raged.\n\nOh, I raged. I *immediately* took him, his manager, my manager and put them together in a room. I shouted that I've been emailing him about compliance over a year, that I received no answer and that *I still had no answer*, therefore fine, put everything offline, but I couldn't be the one to blame. I kept shouting that my working hours are 8 per day and I follow multiple projects, a week was missing from the official enforcement, I cannot be expected to deliver anything in such a short notice. I was trying to flag the issue on time to get things on track (Joe's task), playing the blame game backfired enormously in my favour. Well, one more crack in our lovely relationship but compliance magically arrived.\n\nFast forward a few years later, and my laptop is giving some troubles and randomly not turning on / not charging. My manager panicks: if I'm unreachable, things could go ugly very fast if something happens (not only if something breaks, but even last minute requests), plus the productivity of the team goes down.\n\nWho is the point of contact for hardware? Joe.  \n \\- \"Hey Joe, I need a new laptop, could you help? It's a bit of an emergency\"  \n \\- \"No can do, I don't manage laptops anymore, you have to ask to the company support now.\"\n\nMmmmhhh. Heard that before.  \n \\- \"Hey head of finance, sorry to bother you, my manager might have contacted you already, but I'm urgently trying to get a new laptop, any shortcut?\"  \n \\- \"Did you try Joe?\"  \n \\- \"Sure thing I did, not his job apparently\"  \n \\- \"Let me talk to him\"  \n \\[ ... just a couple of minutes passes ... \\]  \n \\- \"Joe realised that there are some spare laptop for emergencies, since this count as one you can come and collect it directly from the lab tomorrow. I'll be there too, come talk to me so we arrange the transfer\"\n\nGuess who's responsibility was to register any transfer of asset? Joe. And guess who didn't register the asset? Also Joe.\n\nFast forward a few years, time to leave the company. I was a bit fed up, and Joe played a big role in that. I returned all my equipment, except for the one laptop that Joe didn't register. In my wildest dream he will have to pay out of his pocket for a ghost laptop, and will be forced to work for real. But most probably no one will care and Joe will keep doing what he does best: absolutely nothing.\n\nTL;DR I had constant clashes with lazy employee who would constantly refuse to work and deflect any responsability. As last satisfaction, when I left the company, I kept the asset that he was supposed to assign to me but he was too lazy to do.",

One of the other PC techs had given it to a girl--we joked about it as \"Bill's love token to Susie\". It was totally nonstandard gear, so nothing worked right. Eventually she gave it to my buddy and got a new/standard LT. He kept it when He left. Did them a favor taking it off their hands, honestly.\n\nHe told me later that he got a call about his equipment a few months after he left. He was panicked--surely they couldn't know! Turns out they were looking for the test desktop he'd been using as a daily driver before he left (which I had returned it to the lab on his last day); but he took the opportunity to underscore the fact that the only piece of hardware they'd ever formally issued to him was the old laptop that was in his desk drawer when he left.\n\nNobody ever knew. TBH, nobody ever really cared. It's just a laptop. Also didn't help that our asset management guys were the most useless group of human beings I've ever worked with...",

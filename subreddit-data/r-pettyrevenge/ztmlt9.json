    "postText": "I\u2019m (M 50\u2019s) at Walmart and hear a girl (worker, 20s) nicely say \u201cexcuse me ladies\u201c. I see two entitled women (40s) talking in front of the doors that the workers use to restock the store. The entitled woman look at the worker with the distain of royalty being interrupted by a filthy peasant. The worker with here empty supply cart again tells the entitled Bee\u2019s that she needs to get though. Again the entitled woman blow her off with pursed lips and a dirty look. Now I have a particular sensitivity to people mistreating workers and these Bee\u2019s have disrupted my delicate sensibilities. I walk past the entitled woman snagging one of the carts full of groceries and I take off.  It takes them a moment for them to notice before they pursue me. I quickly traverse The back aisle and turn the corner towards the front of the store. One of the entitled woman tried to pull the cart away from me but I make it all the way to the front of the store before letting go. I make a clean getaway and go back to get my cart. Next to the restock doors is the other woman\u2019s cart. Now before you call me the A-Hole I\u2019m fully aware, but these people needed to be taught a lesson and I\u2019m just the one compelled to step up. I grab the cart and head off to the camping section. I take the cold stuff from the cart. I needed milk and eggs anyway so bonus. Later I felt bad that some Walmart worker would have to restock the cart from the camping section. When I went back the cart was gone.\n\nThis happened like a year ago and didn\u2019t think much about it. The other day I was at a restaurant with my extended family. One of the waitresses kept looking at me. I took me while to put it together. When she walked past I said \u201cdidn\u2019t you use to work at Walmart?\u201d. She got excited and exclaimed that she thought it was me. I had a haircut and lost some weight since then. She filled me in on the aftermath. The ladies complained to the manager that a guy tried to steal their stuff for no reason. The manager figured there was more to the story. The entitled women wanted the manager to find me and have me arrested. The worker girl told her what really happened and has since become store folklore. I told her I posted the story in #AITA and got voted the A-hole. She said your not an A-Hole your are a Legend.\n\nMy sister told her another similar story from when we were kids but I\u2019ll save that one for another day.",

I had a customer ask me where he could find vests and I asked him what type of vest. He looked at me like I was the stupidest person on the planet and in a very condescending tone, told me \"a sleeveless one.\" I looked at him a few seconds, smiled and asked if he was looking for down vests, fleece vests, sweater vests and whether he was looking for himself or as a gift. I saw the light bulb go on, his face turned red, he did not apologize (why would he) and he stated he was looking for a down vest. I annoyed him further by asking if it was for him, a female or a child.",

I asked him what kind of plastic he was looking for. His response: \"just plastic...\" So I ask 'ok, what are using it for?' in an effort to figure out what hes looking for. He did not like that a person with tits would have the *audacity* to ask clarifying questions, so he huffed at me, walked off, made it about 10 steps, then decided to turn around and re-engage with me. Walks back up to me and aggressively says \"you know, plastic?!?? You can't tell me where your damn plastic is??! You know? PLASTIC!\" \n\nI was already done with the day before I got to him, and that made the little strings holding my sanity together break. \n\nI looked at him and with all the authority of a Drill Sargeant, I inform him: \"SIR, I can send you to garden for plastic weed block, I can send you to electrical for plastic conduit, I can send you to paint for plastic drop cloths (this is where he realized he fucked up). I can send you to flooring for plastic underlayment, I can send you to kitchen and bath for plastic tub liner (this is when he starts putting his hands up in a placating kind of way), I can send you to plumbing for plastic sprinkler parts, I can send you to doors for plastic window insulation (this is where he starts adding on 'ok....ok' with the placating hands), or I can send you to lumber for plastic housewrap. What kind of PLASTIC do you want??\" \n\nSo he mumbles something about the plastic drop cloths and folks, I have never sped walked so fast in my life. This boomer mf had to jog to keep up with me. Never did find out what he needed it for, but he ended up having me cut him some plastic tub liner. But goddamn, the audacity and entitlement of some people. Like, I'm not asking what kind of plastic because I'm stupid, I'm asking because I can send you to literally *any* aisle and there's something plastic there. Ffs.\n\nEdit typo",

Like you worked in a hardware store,I work as an engineer, plastic is not plastic it's just a category for materials with similar characteristics. Most of them can be used for a wide variety of things some of them are so different at first glance you wouldn't say it's the same material. Like do you want some gear wheel or fake grass, Insulating material or plexiglass, rubber or a machine's housing? I would have pulled out a pen, removed the ink and the ball and gave him the housing: here plastic, it's on the house now I have to go back to work and help costumers that know what they need.",

See, at this hotel if you were a cleaner, you got one cart/mop/bucket/etc. and had to hand in your busted stuff to get a replacement. While he was yelling at a cook I nicked his cleaning cart and hid it on the balcony of the (currently unoccupied for the next 3 weeks) penthouse suite, and left his mop and pail in the elevator that was down until the tech could get out and take a look. Took him a week to find his shit and management's response was \"maybe next time don't piss everyone else off, asshole.\"\n\nWorking there was fun, but not something I'd go back to.",

He was asking for the online subscription and she thought that it should come with the game if you couldn't play it without it. \n\nThe cashier was trying to explain to her that you can play it in single player and that she couldn't give her a subscription because it's a separate service. The lady was claiming that the previous cashier had misled her. This cashier was a saint, doing everything she could to explain it, give her the best options available, and even giving her corporate's number if she truly felt an employee had lied to her.\n\nAfter a few minutes of hearing the same thing come out of this woman over and over I piped up and said something along the lines of \"I don't know if you are acting stupid or truly don't understand the difference between cannot and will not, but other people are trying to check out. So accept her advice and buy a subscription or call corporate, she's made it abundantly clear that she is not in a position to do anything about your problem.\"\n\nShe looked at me, looked at the cashier, looked back at me, and asked the cashier if she was going to do anything about \"that\" while pointing at me. The casher just said \"he's another customer, I don't have any authority over him.\" and the old lady huffed and left. \n\nThe cashier let out an audible sigh, her shoulders drooped, and she thanked me, that it \"felt like I was talking to a parrot\". I just told her that I was only doing what I wished others would have done when I was in the service industry.\n\nI know I'm 100% an A-hole, but sometimes we are needed.\n\nYears ago I saw a quote that said something like \"I believe in karma, but I also believe that some of us must help it along. Maybe karma introduced them to me that day.\"\n\nEdit: word",

One or two extra carts of stuff is just another time to say \"OK, gotta reshelve some shit now.\"  In the scope of the workday, it is almost meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile a customer taking it upon himself to show up a couple of entitled jerks, to the immediate benefit of a store employee, who inherently lacks the power to stand up for herself even to the basic minimal level of a person on the street? Yes, please!  I'll happily reshelve a whole buncha shit if people are gonna step up and do that.",

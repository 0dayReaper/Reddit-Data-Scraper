    "postText": "Disclaimer, this was about 7 years ago, so the conversations are summarized and not 100% word for word.\n\nI used to work in a call center where everyone had little cubicles. You could chat with people on either side or behind you if things got slow, but anyone on the other side of the divider was sort of hard to see or chat with. (Only important because Karen was in this hard to see location from me)\n\nI have issues with overheating, medical stuff. I liked to sit right under the AC vent. Nobody fought me for this, because it was a little too cold for most people. Well, being a woman, this meant that sometimes I had some nipple pokey issues on some days. It's perfectly natural, and to most people, not noticeable because it was under my shirt + bra.\n\nKaren notices this and makes a report to HR.\n\nHR woman and my direct supervisor PARADE me through the cubicles and into their office, to question me about my nipples. Now, I could have thrown a fit about this to begin with, since we didn't actually have a dress code and it's none of their damn business. They asked me to prove I was wearing a bra, so I showed them the straps. They told me \"good enough\" basically, and to go back to my desk.\n\nI refused to go back. I said I needed to place a complaint about someone. They asked me who I was reporting. I said \"I don't know, but YOU do. I want to report whoever it was that's been staring at my breasts all day. Now that I know someone is staring, I feel like this is a hostile work environment.\" They acted like I was joking at first, until I said \"If you don't have a talk with them, I will go over your heads and report you for forcing me to reveal my bra to you.\"\n\nI got escorted back to my desk, and Karen was sitting there looking smug... until they escorted HER to the HR office instead. I don't know what happened to her in the office, and I didn't care- they did their part by having their talk with her. All I really wanted was to know WHO did it.\n\nSince it was a very slow day, all my co-workers started asking me what that was all about. Office gossip, you know. I told everyone exactly what had happened, and added that Karen must be fascinated with my breasts since she noticed (everyone else confirmed they didn't even notice). When she came back from HR, every person in the room knew what she had done, and was glaring at her.\n\nSnitches didn't get stitches, and didn't get fired either. But, they got treated like the Karen they were. Nobody would talk to her. People would be chatting, see her come try to join the conversation, and go silent and turn away from her. Some people did \"loud whispers\" and made comments like \"shhh, don't say anything, she will report you!\" She quit about 2 weeks later.  \n\n\nEdit; wow, this is the most notifications I have ever logged in to! Thank you for awards and replies!  \n\\-For those saying I should sue, this was about 7 years ago, the company no longer exists.   \n\\-I didn't sue them back then because the company was pretty new, and they were new to their positions just like the rest of us, and in their 20s. They seemed like they were not trained on how to handle this, awkward and confused. I didn't want to ruin their lives over it, I don't think they'd ever do it again.  \n\\-For those saying she was jealous, I have no idea what she could have been jealous of. I was almost 40, gaining weight fast from my disability, and I'd say 4/10. All I can think of is maybe she was jealous I was giggling with co-workers while trying to quietly play Cards Against Humanity.",

What rule am I breaking? None. Apparently she thought the lace was \"provocative\". I was like is this a reprimand? Do I need to go home and change? No to both. Just don't wear the cardigan again. So I got to wear it the rest of the day.\n\nI know who complained. She was mad I was dating a guy in her section. He and I were both in our 20s and she was in her 40s. It's not like I was stealing him from her and it wasn't even serious. So I just loudly told people about it all day without mentioning her name.

She said she had been receiving complaints about my clothing from many others, and advised me to purchase more modest clothes (else she would have to report me to HR who I knew would not take my side).

Our primary function is picking and packing, meaning while she was picking this would get worse. She took about 15-20 bathroom breaks per day. My manager at the time was also pregnant, and these excessive disappearances made it difficult for my manager to go to the bathroom, because the BO smell lingered so badly. Every time manager went to the bathroom she'd nearly vomit. \n\nDue to this employees hostility issues manager and I addressed these concerns with HR first. Instead of discussing the hygiene with her, they pulled the employees scans in and out of the warehouse and realized daily she was spending about half the day in the bathroom, taking lunch breaks that were longer than allowed, coming in late fairly often, and this coupled with the hostility resulted in termination. \n\nBut girl WASH YOURSELF.",

            "comment": "I had a manager who had the absolute gall to essentially sexually harass me that way! It was a woman, no less! \n\nWhen I worked in retail, we had a few different options for our uniform tops, which the company provided. They required that we wear tan khakis slacks or shorts(obviously a certain length past finger tips). Of course they did not pay for those, nor provide them. Although they honestly should have, or at least given us an allowance for them. Anyway, I digress. \n\nOur top options were as follows:\n\n1) Tshirts with store logo across the back, either short sleeve/long sleeve.\n\n2) Burgundy Polo with logo\n\n3) Sweatshirt with logo\n\nAnd lastly, but not least, also where the trouble comes in.....\n\n4) A denim long sleeve button down over a white tank top or T-shirt (white tops *WE* wore our own!)\n\nI personally preferred the look of the denim over white with the khaki. It was just more polished in my opinion. I always had the sleeves rolled up. It was cute.  \n\nEvery morning shift began one hour before the store opened to any customers. Which is obviously the time used to not only get the store ready to open, but to also do things with product in the stock room! \n\nAll of that being said, no one can see into the stockroom, at all. Period. And they definitely can't when the store is not even open for business!\n\nSo I am in the back, with at least 30 minutes before it's time to open. It's warm because I am getting inventory checked in and priced from our last truck. I normally am the one who opened alone. For some reason she decided to come that morning. No big. I didn't have a problem with that. It's whatever. When I'm unboxing, pricing, and shelving freight in the stockroom where no one can see me, I would obviously take off the heavier overshirt! There was no reason to be hot and wear the denim when I had the white tank underneath. Now I also have medical conditions. Which make wearing traditional undergarments impossible. The pressure from them on my skin is excruciatingly painful! I cannot do it! However, I wear tank tops that have double linings *AND* a built-in shelf bra! \n\nA double lined tank top, *WITH* a shelf bra, is what I was wearing when she got up close to me, as I was working, staring at my breasts, and spat at me, \"Are you not wearing a *BRA**!??????\"! I was completely caught off guard! Like, \" Wtf, did you just say to me!???\", is what I was thinking! But all I could get out in that moment of shock was, \" Yes, actually, I *AM*! I am also wearing my denim shirt on the floor, like always, and you know that! \n\nI happened to be a 36C. I didn't even have any cleavage showing, ffs! She made me feel so dirty and gross. I don't know what TF her problem was. But she was awful. \n\nShe's probably one of the worst bosses I've ever had. She was a Karen before we even knew what those were. I have so many horror stories from my time under her regime! \n\nSo, good for you OP, for standing up for yourself! Because I should have done more for myself then. But I was still very, very young in retrospect and I hadn't really learned that I didn't have to take that abuse.",

I stayed at work for overnight to get a demo ready for a client.\n\nCouple weeks later, my Project Manager asks me in a meeting why I billed 32 hours between 2 days. Told him it was because I stayed there all night into the next day to fix the code and do the demo. He tells me we are burning too fast, and I need to get the project in under hours.\n\nWe go back and forth a few times, I explain they gave me 1 guy who doesn't even know the language the project is written in, and another guy who has already accepted another position and is leaving in 3 weeks. So they are billing hours, and not getting anything done. I get irritated, it's like 4:45, so at one point I say, \"OK, I am going home\"\n\nGet pulled into HR 3 weeks later asking about \"the incident\". I am accused of slamming a door and punching a wall.... So I bring up that we are in a temp office space, and the \"room\" we were in is next to all of the execs, and there are literally 20 seats directly outside. Ask if anyone else heard anything.\n\nThen I ask them to talk to THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE MEETING THAT DAY, and all of them have no idea what the accuser is talking about.\n\nSo, they say that there \"isn't enough evidence to verify the claim\".  I ask about reporting him for making a false HR report, and am told that would be a \"retaliatory HR complaint\", and those are not allowed. So evidently you can accuse people of whatever the fuck you want, with no negative outcomes for you if its bullshit.\n\nI called up a friend who was at another consulting agency, lined up a new job, and left 2 weeks later. Fuck them, that entire office is closed down now.",

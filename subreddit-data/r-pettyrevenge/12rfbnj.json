    "postText": "About 4yrs ago I used to live in a nice HOA in a small town in TX and enjoyed having only one neighbor over my backyard fence.  The plot was about 2 acres and the other side of the backyard butted up to a hay field. The stars were beautiful at night because of virtually no light pollution...\n\nUntil the neighbor decided to install an incredibly bright security light over their back porch aimed right at my back patio and bedroom windows.  I tried to ignore it at first and put shades in the bedroom, but out on the patio it was like having a bright LED headlight in your face all night. I consulted the HOA about adding a privacy addition to my fence to increase it's height, and they said no because it's already at the 8' max allowed height.  The said there was nothing in the bylaws or whatever about bright lights so nothing they could do.\n\nDiplomacy:  So I hated for this to be the thing where we finally had a formal greeting after 3yrs of back porch waves but I walked over and rang the doorbell with $20.  I politely explained how the light was causing the aforementioned nuisance and asked if there was any way I could convince him to point the light down or in a different direction and even offered the to buy him a case of beer (the $20) out of good-will and even a new motion sensing light. He seemed nice and agreed to point it down...but after waiting a month, nothing changed. I went back to have another polite conversation and he said he had changed his mind and was going to leave it on every night and leave it pointed as-is.\n\nPetty Revenge:  Needless to say I was a bit upset diplomacy failed and started figuring out how to win. If the military taught me anything there's always ways to adapt and overcome. So I started researching fast growing plants to create big privacy walls and reading through the HOA bylaws and city/state ordinances about what I could or couldn't plant and if there were any repercussions for encroachment across the property line. I quickly discovered running bamboo, despite being very invasive, would grow super fast to make the neighbor's house and light disappear from view and there was nothing on the HOA/state/city books to prevent me from planting it or cause legal recourse if it spread and grew on his side on the fence. Only thing he could do is cut anything that grew on his side of the line. So I pulled the trigger and planted a bunch of Golden Bamboo which grows and spreads crazy fast in TX and grows up to 20' tall...I didn't care if it took over the fence line because his house is 15' from the fence while mine was 50yds away so I planted a bunch right against the fence and only put root barrier on my side to prevent it spreading into my yard. Within 6mo his house and light were GONE from view, replaced by a pretty bamboo jungle row at the edge of my yard. Within 1yr he complained it was growing into his yard via mailed letters, they went right into the trash with no response. He rang my doorbell once and I looked at him through the window but just didn't answer the door. I unexpectedly sold the house and moved 2yrs after planting for a career opportunity...It's been 2yrs since I sold and I just checked the property on Google Earth and his entire backyard is bamboo.\n\nEdit: Wow, this post took off overnight, kinda like bamboo. Thanks for the hilarious responses.",

The initial baby canes that grow only get a few feet tall and they're kinda bushy and shaggy. Once a cane maxes out in height, that's it, they never grow taller, but they make energy for the plant to use for taller growth the next growing season. Each year, the plant sends up new, progressively taller canes.",

The person that bought the house on the opposite side of the alley at the back of my house decided to clear out the bamboo on his property line on the other side of his fence. He wanted to expand his backyard. I shit you not, there was a tiny 1 bedroom two story house that was probably built in the late 40s and a car in it! No one knew about it. The bamboo had completely swallowed it basically.",

Make sure you're not in one of those, and that you get the root barrier plenty deep and long. \n\nWe had to do something similar to this (we used clumping bamboo, because we didn't need to punish our neighbor) in a previous house because our second floor dining room window looked directly through the neighbor's first floor \"privacy\" window and into their living room. Planted the bamboo on our side because we didn't want to watch them at every meal. ;-)",

Their comment was \"if you see anybody carting off our stuff you better do something\". Mhmm your lights certainly deter thieves from your vacant house.\n\nIronically, nearly a year later I walked my dog past on the street and saw their shed and gate were wide open and texted the owner to see if they were aware and offered to shut things up. He was appreciative and said some contractors were there and asked if I could check that doors were locked. No problem.\n\nI have a feeling they will have less ill will towards a simple request now.",

Our downstairs neighbour was not considerate in the slightest. \n\nHe worked away so when he was home it was party central, raves until 3 or 4 in the morning as many as 6 times a week. \n\nWe tried talking to him about it, he tried to say it wasn\u2019t that often, that late or that loud, however I\u2019d been keeping a record of the disturbances and had recordings of the noise from our apartment. \n\nWe reported to the council but they basically said they couldn\u2019t do much as it was out of hours and we had to report it to the police as antisocial behaviour, so we did.  \n\nI also became incredibly \u201cclumsy\u201d I\u2019d drop things on the hard floors when I was getting ready in the morning (between 6 and 7 because I was working 2 jobs at that point and was quite tired and grumpy about missing out on sleep) I also realised that I had slightly more time on a morning, therefore that became the time to get housework done, particularly hoovering. \n\nIt took 2 days of that before he was banging on our door to complain, so I turned all of his arguments back on him. Between that and a couple of visits from the police he settled down and house raves reduced to Friday and Saturday nights only which we were willing to accept as reasonable.",

With a bonus of having a backyard full of birds and butterflies!\n\nAnd most of the native plants you can use will spread like crazy because where you live is the perfect environment for them!

            "comment": "I was living in a beach town in Australia. The view was incredible and just a block to the beach. The problem was the neighbors. Some Brazilians moved in and would stay up and party all night long for 3-4 days a week. Called the police and they wouldn\u2019t do anything. The After a long night of partying, Brazilians liked to go sit out in the yard and the only sunny patch was right outside my livingroom window about 10\u2019 away. So not only would I have to listen to them all night, I\u2019d have to deal with them looking right into my livingroom. If you know anything about Australia, you know about the bugs. I threw multiple bags of sugar on their sunny spot for a few days. They set up shop a few days later and I heard them slapping at themselves and finally ran back down their yard dragging their chairs behind them. I felt satisfied.",

Takes a few years. \n\nShortcut *for soft bamboo like knotweed ONLY:* Do a normal clear, then level the ground it\u2019s on, (including the root clusters). Now next time it sprouts you can just mow it like a lawn! It\u2019s softer than asparagus when it\u2019s new so it\u2019ll be an easy mow and smells like sweet rhubarb pur\u00e9e afterwards. Very therapeutic lol.\n\nEDIT: a word",

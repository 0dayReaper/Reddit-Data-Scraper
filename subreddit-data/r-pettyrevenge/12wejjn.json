    "postText": "So this happened a while ago, but I was recently reminded. I was traveling by train, and it was going to take 13 hours, plus an hour switch in the middle to swap trains. Please keep in mind, I was 16 at the time, but due to a pituitary issue, I looked 20+. Like, 6'0\", 200lbs, and a short but health beard.\n\nAnyhow, the first leg of the journey went well. Nice, quiet train car, no fussing children, most people slept or used headphones for their entertainment. \n\nThe issue arose on the 2nd part. I was in my seat, enjoying a sandwich when someone approached and asked if I'd be willing to wait for the next train. Normally, not a problem. But culmination of circumstances meant it would be now. I had arranged a ride at my destination, my phone was bricked, I didn't have any change and the station we were at had an ATM but it was out of order. In short, I had absolutely no way of contacting my ride. \n\nI tried explaining this, but the lady scoffed and walked by, hitting me with her purse as she did so (I'm assuming it was by accident). A few minutes later, an employee (conductor?) Walled up with her and told me I needed to get off the train to let her ride. I explained the situation, showed my ID that proved I was a minor, and that's when she pulled out \"he tried to take my purse. I felt a tug as I walked by\". At that, I was basically told \"leave the train and wait for the next one or we'll call the cops.\"\n\nSo I did just that. But friends, here's where the pettiness comes in. I stood, stared for a brief moment as I let loose a long, quite fart. One of those hot ones that you just know is going to curl nose hairs. \n\nI then left the train. And while it sucked, and the station manager arranged for me to get a private ride (apparently forcing a minor off their scheduled travel plans was a big no-no. Who knew?), I felt fantastic knowing she'd have a few hours in that gaseous trap.",

Well I went back in and though it wasn't still a nuclear melt down, it still smelled pretty bad. Though the breakroom didn't have exhaust, it  did have air vents giving new air. I didn't think it was possible for the stink to last that long but it either did or he let one loose b4 he left off of break 15 minutes be4.",

    "postText": "A friend suggested I post this here. This happened a couple of years ago. I (28f) was dating Max (29M) for 5 years. We were full on together. We lived together, shared finances, had 2 dogs, etc. My best friend Amy (28f) lived 10 minutes away so we were always with each other. We were pretty much the three musketeers. \n\nOne day I\u2019m scrolling on instagram and I see my boyfriend in the background of a picture posted to our local bars page. He was supposed to be at work and I\u2019d never been given a reason not to trust him so I figured it was an older picture as we go there a couple times a month. But when he got home he was wearing the same blue button up and jeans. I had a horrible feeling in my stomach but I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nThat night I went through his phone, yeah yeah I know but idc. We\u2019ve always shared passwords and have never had an issue with using each others phones. When I checked his messages I saw a chain with someone named \u201cJack\u201d. We didn\u2019t know a Jack, so I read through them and my heart just fucking breaks. I\u2019ve known my best friend since we were in diapers, I know how she texts. But I checked the number just to be sure and yep, they were talking behind my back. Not just talking though, there were pictures and mentions of sexual acts that had happened. I spent the night crying and sending myself all of the screen shots and everything I could find. \n\nBy morning, I realized that I can\u2019t just confront them. I need to prepare. So I set out to put money aside. I tell him our fridge is broken so I\u2019m using some of our savings to fix it, we need a plumber for this or a handyman for that. All lies but I needed a reason to pull money out of the account we both had access to. It took me 2 months but I was able to pull enough out to put a deposit and pay a couple months in advance on a new apt that I found that was closer to work and pet friendly. I was able to slowly move stuff there while he was at work ( I told him I was doing some spring cleaning to clear out the clutter). \n\n\nIn the mean time I fucked with their heads. I\u2019d mention things about each other that would cause drama, like telling Max that Amy talked about a cute guy from work, or telling Amy that Max mentioned marriage and kids with me (she\u2019s infertile due to a childhood illness). \n\nThe day before I was leaving I set my plan onto motion. I knew where my best friend went for lunch most days of the week so I watched and waited. When she arrived I went in and pretended I didn\u2019t want to throttle her for breaking my trust and my heart. We sat down and chatted and I slyly mentioned sex with Max. In their messages she told him that she didn\u2019t want him to sleep with me, apparently she\u2019d become quite possessive of my bf. I made comments about how sore I was because we did it rough just like I like it. How good he was at oral, you name it I mentioned it. Her face got redder and redder and it was amazing to watch. \n\nI\u2019d seen her react that way before but I never realized why. She\u2019d always insist on watching late night movies with us or ask to sleep on our couch instead of going home and be mad when I had to say no I want to have privacy with my bf. I just thought she was lonely or a little clingy but I never would have imagined she didn\u2019t want to leave because she wanted to make sure we weren\u2019t having sex. \n\nLater that day I go home and once again pretend that everything is normal. But I sit down on the couch with him and snuggle up to him while he watches tv. After about 20 minutes I straddle him and ask him how his day was and blah blah blah. Then I bring up that I ran into Amy at lunch and \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who she was with!\u201d I told him how Amy was with Dave (her real life coworker that has hung out with us multiple times) and how it\u2019s so cute that they\u2019re dating now. \n\nWhen I say he froze, I don\u2019t think he even breathed. He just sort of muttered, \u201c I didn\u2019t know she was seeing someone.\u201d So I tell him all about how I caught them kissing and after Dave left to go back to work Amy told me all about their amazing sex life. And of course I had to add in there that Dave was the first guy to give her a real O and how\u2019s she\u2019s always had to fake it with guys before. \n\nI\u2019ve never seen him look so dejected before. That night I asked that we do a phone free night, which we\u2019d do often so that we could be in our own bubble. I could tell that he was a little hesitant but he turned his phone off and put it in the basket we use for it. We watched a movie and cuddled on the couch and he stayed as stiff as a board for the majority of it before he relaxed enough to fall asleep on the couch. \n\nOnce he was out, I grabbed his work phone and sent out a contact list wide email about how I may be in a bad mood for the next couple of weeks because my mistress gave me the clap, then I changed the pass code on it and turned it off.  I knew that he wouldn\u2019t turn it on until he got to his worksite that was 40 minutes away. As soon as he was out the door I immediately packed my bags, important papers and the dogs and left. I also unscrewed most lightbulbs, took the batteries out of the remote, took the router plug in so he wouldn\u2019t have Wi-Fi and cranked the AC up to 80F. When I got to my new place, I sent her a text asking how my p***y tastes and then blocked them both.  Then I posted screenshots to my fb and let everyone know what horrible people they were.",

            "comment": "It won\u2019t let me edit it but here\u2019s a PART 2:\nThe next day his mom called me to talk things over with me. She is an amazing woman who raised him on her own whilst creating a very profitable company. He was initially set to get the company when she unfortunately passes away but she changed her will so that he only gets the minimum dollar amount and her brother will get the company. I know that hurt him in a way I couldn\u2019t imagine because he always talked about running it and taking over for her to make her proud. I just know he cried when she told him that. \n\nMy ex neighbor Martha (70is) is an absolute shit starter. If there is drama to be had she will find it or create it. I\u2019d told her I was moving out and why about a week before I left so she\u2019d keep me in the loop in the aftermath. \n\nAmy moved in shortly after I left and through the thin walls of our duplex, Martha heard everything unfold. Apparently they fought constantly because they couldn\u2019t trust each other ( go figure ). Amy was always yelling about him having sex with me and how she wanted all new furniture because she couldn\u2019t sit somewhere where we hadn\u2019t been intimate. She is also a mess. Like an actual mess. She doesn\u2019t know how to clean, throw out trash, do laundry, or cook. Max has always been and will always be a neat freak. I mean everything has a place and everything should be in its place kind of man. There\u2019s no way they would be able to live together full time without wanting to strangle each other. \n\nAnd Mrs. Martha, bless her cheetah print soul, loved to let Amy know that Max\u2019s beautiful sister was coming over a lot now that OP was gone. Of course Max doesn\u2019t have a sister and she\u2019s lying but boy did it have the desired effect of an all out screaming match between them. She\u2019s angry he would cheat on her, he\u2019s angry the house looks like a garbage pit, she yells because he had sex with me in the kitchen after they\u2019re had sex in her apartment, he yells that she was the biggest mistake he ever made and he wants me back. \n\nThat hits her hard apparently so she starts throwing stuff at him and he calls the cops on her. She already had a bit of a record for fighting at bars and clubs so when the police get there they detain her and have her sit on the curb out front. Mrs. Martha comes out to be nosey and see what\u2019s going on. She gives a statement about what she hears and as they are putting Amy in the back of the squad car she yells out to Amy to not worry because she\u2019s sure Max\u2019s sister will come over to help clean the house. When I tell y\u2019all I love this woman with all of my heart! Amy freaks the hell out and starts trying to run at Max and is apparently tazed and put in the back of a squad car. Max tells her to stop trying to interfere but of course that means nothing to Mighty Mrs. Martha so she just smiles and goes back into her house. Amy got released a couple days later after making bail and only went back to the duplex a couple of times, both with police escorts, so we think Max took out an order of protection against her.\n\nMax has made multiple Facebook pages to message me and apologize but I block them all immediately. He\u2019s called my work as well but thankfully I work remotely and I\u2019d already told my supervisors not to give out any information regarding me or my contact details. \nI don\u2019t have any siblings or family for them to reach out to so I figured if they\u2019d try to reach me they would do it through my job. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what happened with his work emails, though I\u2019m assuming he had A LOT of explaining to do to his bosses, coworkers and business connections. When I think about how he had to have that conversation over and over again it makes me smiles. \n\nAmy has apparently moved to a new state and doesn\u2019t talk with anyone in our old friend group, probably because they all came down on her pretty hard. To think about her still breaks my heart. We\u2019d been friends all my life. When my parents died, she was my rock. She made me see past my grief and my depression and want to live again. I try to think about the good times and not let the bad times ruin them for me. \n\nWhen I was reading their messages I could see the evolution of the conversations and the happiness they shared at doing things behind my back. The night I was reading them it was like my ribs burned and my stomach was queasy but I had to think logically vs emotionally. I didn\u2019t truly breakdown until I got to my new apartment. I just sat on the floor of my new kitchen and cried for what felt like hours. It took me a couple of weeks but I slowly started to unpack and find a new rhythm in my new life. Juno and Meatlof (the dogs) helped a lot too. They were a little nervous over the move and not having Max with them but as of today they are amazing and happy we\u2019ve moved somewhere with a dog park. \n\nThis was 4ish years ago so I\u2019ve moved on in life but it\u2019s definitely left some scars. I started therapy 6 months after I moved out and that\u2019s helped a lot but I still haven\u2019t been able to put myself into a trusting relationship. I\u2019ve yet to have another long term partner as it just gives me too much anxiety and trust issues.",

To her, it was a fine hobby to have. She sat in front of her little house, smoking her cigarette, drinking her \"ice tea,\" and watching the neighbors. She knew EVERYTHING people were up to. She was loved by the local thugs even because she would give them crap. No one bothered her, but she sure had the \"scoop\" on whose husband was cheating, who was buying what, what women were wearing, and where they worked. We didn't know how she knew, but then again, everyone hung out on her porch with her. She'd always had a pot of coffee, ice tea, beer &amp; more and would deal you in for a game of Skip Bo. She died peacefully in her sleep at 97 years old. I think there were a lot of people who gave huge sighs of both sadness and relief that secrets could now stay buried. The flowers and notes filled the porch just like the church was overflowing. I think many just wanted to make sure she was actually dead because many thought she was just too stubborn to die. We all argued if she went to heaven or hell. Either way, we figured she took over wherever she went.",

Right now we're pretty sure the husband doesn't help out with the baby enough and/or he's been hanging out with the wrong crowds and the wife is PISSED.\n\nAll that to say, if she left him and asked us about the aftermath we would definitely tell her lmao. \n\nBefore these neighbors we had a young couple across from us who broke up and it was interesting to see how they each handled it. They lived together until their lease was up.\n\nIt's really easy to tell what's going on with your neighbors when you live in apartments. My partner goes outside to smoke multiple times a day and he knows most of our surrounding neighbors. He knows a fair amount of what's going on with them just from quick chats. You can learn a lot about people's lives by just being friendly and chatting with them. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

If that makes sense.  A weird wild rambling story with odd irrelevant bits thrown in is a lot more convincing (to me) than one that goes from point A to point Z with every statement consistent with the rest.  \n  \nIt's like the early 80s, when people started really making heavy use of drum machines.  The sheer regularity and lack of mistakes made it easy to spot- and so the manufacturers/developers started adding the ability for the drum machines to be less rhythmically precise.  It's called \"humanizing,\" which is only slightly frightening (if it were an industrial robot, I'd be scared shitless.  drum machines are probably uninterested in subjugating the human race).  \n  \nThe bit about the dogs, which has no bearing on any of the rest of the petty revenge, is what convinced me.  That's the sort of thing an emotional writer would throw in, not realizing that it's a bump in the path of the story.  \n  \n(Oddly enough, I'm a compulsive \"get your story straight\" kind of person, so when *I* write something, it tends to be pretty self-consistent.  Which probably leads people to believe it's entirely fabricated.)",

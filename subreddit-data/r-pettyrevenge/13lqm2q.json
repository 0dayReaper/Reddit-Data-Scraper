    "postText": "In my last place of work, when I was looking to hire someone for my department, I would offer cold drinks and coffee at the interview in order to make them feel welcome. We could take the cold drinks out of the storage, but we had to order coffee from the kitchen and someone from the kitchen team would bring it out.\n\nOne day, they called me back and said they couldn't bring me coffee since the CEO had decided coffee would only be provided for whole-day events. Grr, that cheapskate. Since then, I provided my own coffee for interviewees because to me, the welcoming impression was more important than the, like, 30 cents a cup of coffee costs.\n\nBut I plotted my little revenge since I had been asked to do a workshop for the other department heads and the CEO also wanted to participate. He for some reason loved workshops, well why not. So the day of the workshop came, I prepped the room, the participants trickled in and got settled, including the CEO. I greeted the group and laid out the plan for the next few hours, asked if there were any questions.\n\nThe CEO asked: Can we maybe call the kitchen and ask where the coffee is? They seem to be running late.\n\nI made a point of taking a sip from my travel mug and then answered that there would be no coffee, because this was a half-day workshop and our new rules said that coffee would only be provided for whole day events.\n\nI still cherish the surly look he gave me in response. He did not say anything and instead opened a bottle of water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to address some of recurrent comments: \n\n1. I'm female, so please imagine the \"coffee is for closers\" guy with long hair, a smaller nose and some titties.\n2. No, I didn't get fired. Who the hell gets fired for such a thing, even if you live in a place without workers rights?!\n3. For the questions about how this affected my relationship with the CEO down the line: We didn't get along anyway after an incident where he tried to fuck me over financially. This was not a problem, though, since I had a boss that was between him and me in hierarchy and if I ever needed anything, I just told her and she made it happen. I didn't really have to deal with him.",

New standards, new rules, something something. We resisted, and somehow someone made the new idea go away. Still, a few years after the move, someone still loads the coffee maker in the morning and the first one with withdrawal symptoms turns it on, and those in office have a joint coffee break.  \n\nThe headquarters arranges trainings, and every time during a break time there is so long a queue to the slooooow coffee dispenser machines that the break is nearly over before everyone has got their specialty coffees. So, effectively the coffee break has become a coffee line break. Yay?",

So he goes to the office lady to ask how much is in the coffee account. \n\n$1,082. At ten cents a cup the coffee machine cleared over $250 a year.\n\nOnce he brought it up in the next staff meeting it was all they talked about. Some teachers wanted to blow it on a boozer. Others thought they should donate it to charity.\n\nIn the end they just stepped up their coffee game.

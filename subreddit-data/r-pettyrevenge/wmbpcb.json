    "postText": "Oh this is the perfect place for this little story. My significant other had a double life. He had a girlfriend that thought she was in a full blown relationship when he practically lived with me. She thought I was getting in the way of their love story so she contacted me to give me the what\u2019s up. For context, I knew nothing about her. Unfortunately, she was the side chick who believed that coming to his place for 1-2 hours once a week to give him sexual favors was a legit relationship. When she contacted me to try to tell me to stay away from her man\u2019s I called him and he freaked out. \n\nI told him it was either her or me. He cried and pleaded and told me he can\u2019t live without me. I made him dump her on the phone in front of me. I then turned around and dumped him. That was 100% always my plan LOL",

Because she discovered (after 47 years of marriage) that he had an entire other family. And had had that other family for FORTY years. 2 kids with family #1, 3 kids with family #2. \n\nNaturally, during the divorce, she got everything. He got family #2.",

Plus, he told wife #1 that his Vets group (he served in Vietnam) built some sort of 'recovery/retreat house' on a nearby lake and he worked with Vets who had PTSD or whatever at the lake house. These 2 things allowed him to be away for long stretches. Wife #2 knew about wife #1, so he didn't need another cover story for her. \n\nWhat's most amzing to me was that he'd tell wife #1 about wife #2, but using a fictitious husband, BOB. Wife #2 was named Betty (I'm making names up here), and her first 2 daughters were Olive &amp; Brianna. So, B-O-B....Betty, Olive, Brianna. \nSo he'd tell wife how his friends Bob &amp; Betty took the girls to the State Fair, or Bob &amp; Betty got a new sofa set. Or Bob &amp; Betty spent the weekend painting the kitchen. \n\nBut HE WAS BOB, do you understand? 40 years telling Wife #1 about Bob &amp; Betty. Fucking sociopath, this guy.",

I might be wrong- i seem to recall she did/had done home nursing or something similar? I am assuming wife #2 worked. I am also assuming he (at least partially) contibuted to household #2. They were Boomers, remember. Money wasn't much of an issue. \n\nWife #1 was a Kansas farmgirl who taught Sunday School and sang in the damn choir. She was like a 50's TV housewife. The neighborhood kids nicknamed her June Cleaver, IIRC. He came back from Nam like some war hero and swpt her off her 19yo Kansas feet. She was a Wonderful woman, I loved her to death!",

Seriously kept 2 phones and stuff, only found out because SO from back home came to the college to surprise them and boom other SO.

Thing was, her husband had had a vasectomy so he was pretty sure the child wasn\u2019t his, and sure enough, the baby was my uncle\u2019s. My aunt separated from him and was considering divorcing him, and asking my mom for advice as she was sadly the only one who wasn\u2019t blaming the baby, which my mom recommended divorce.\n\nUltimately though, she forgave him and got back together with him, and even became a stepmother to her husband\u2019s illegitimate daughter (he got full custody of her, and my aunt didn\u2019t have any biological children). As far as I know, he\u2019s stayed faithful ever since. Of course, this is an exception, not the rule. My mom still thinks that she should have divorced him. However, she didn\u2019t and I\u2019m surprised that she was willing to raise a child that was the result of my uncle\u2019s affair. Even my cousin said that my aunt is her real mother while her biological mother neglected her after her divorce. \n\n(Sorry if this is a complete, incoherent mess. It\u2019s late at night and I\u2019m tired, so I\u2019m browsing Reddit, making me a bigger idiot due to the blue light tricking my brain into still thinking it\u2019s daytime. \ud83d\ude44)",

The stress of being the marriage police, the loss of trust, and allowing the person who betrayed you continued access to your life and body take a toll mentally and physically.  Many cheaters who are caught just get sneakier and often use the second chance to hide martial assets.  Most of the second chance relationships fail within a few years - years of anguish for the betrayed party, but of glorious centrality for the cheater.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to think that they lived happily ever after, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to gamble my future on a cheater.",

He was a purchasing agent for a large company. He would always have invoices, purchase orders, &amp; assorted paperwork in his pockets. When doing laundry I would check his pockets, put everything on the counter &amp; then put it all on his desk. As I am unfolding &amp; straightening up the papers, one was a letter\u2026from him to her. I read it, and read it &amp; read it again.

It is the idea that the world is black and white, and that it is easy to distinguish the good person from the bad, and then the  bad, (toxic), person should be treated as irredeemable and discarded.  I'm not saying people should stay with physically violent partners, or suffer years of abuse, but it is very easy to label the faults and failings of other people and not come to the difficult recognition and understanding about how  one's own interactions may have been involved in creating the problems in the relationship. \n\nWe can't know why your uncle had an extra-marital relationship, or why your aunt decided that their relationship was worth maintaining.  We can posit from the fact that they were willing to take responsibility for the child and make a sincere effort to raise her in what I'd like to assume is a loving home, that those two people made really tough decisions and did a lot of difficult work on their relationship, and maybe they, the child, and the world in general are all better off for your aunt and uncle having the courage and tenacity to struggle through what must have been an incredibly difficult time. \n\nWe all make mistakes, or even intentionally hurt other people.  It is easy to see yourself as a blameless victim, but we all contribute to our own fate.  Not every person who mistreats another has an untreatable personality disorder.  Most decent human beings are wounded in some way, and most of us wound the people around us, usually without malicious intention, but mostly through a lack of understanding or inattention -  because our own wounds make it hard for us to be aware and kind.  \n\nI've long had a motto, which regularly fail to live up to, it is this: If you have to make a choice about how to treat a person, err on the side of kindness and generosity.",

Far less uncomfortable to play Us and Them.\n\nIn my family, someone left his wife for a while for a friend of hers. It happened as a consequence of him being a generous, helpful man - the friends husband had died, leaving her with school-age kids, and he started out trying to help her much as he had helped many other people - including my own immaediate family - it was exactly the sort of person he was. But things obviously went wrong this time round.\n\nEventually, he got back together with his wife, and as far as I could tell, they were very happy together for the rest of his life.\n\nI don't know anything of what was said between the two of them, but, as you say, clearly far from black and white.",

And he didn\u2019t cancel EVEN THOUGH HE JUST HAD A BABY!!  So we went to the store, got a rattle, a onesie and some other stuff that I don\u2019t remember.  Wrapped it up as a gift and met him as planned.  I told him I was thinking of him so I got him a present.  You should have seen his face when he opened it and saw that the gig was up.  I then poured my beer over his head and said \u201ccongrats on your baby MF\u2019er\u201d and left with my friend.  I never talked to him again.",

He started sniffing round a new girl who had enrolled in our second year, eventually trying to hide the fact he was slipping off to see her, gaslighting me, telling me I was mad/obsessive/controlling/imagining things and everything else. I lost loads of weight through stress from his shitty mind games. We broke up with him still denying everything, and it turned out she was only interested in him as long as he had a girlfriend (it transpired she had been \"just hanging out\", or trying to, with several other guys in relationships too). Sad face. \n\nAfter we both graduated we started reconnecting and got back together for a short while, then I told him I wasn't interested, dumped him over the phone, and continued to play some small mind games of my own for a little while because why not. (Heard he had a new gf, so I texted that I'd been looking through old photos and thinking of him, which sent him into a tailspin) It was 25 years ago now, and I regret nothing.",

            "comment": "My ex was a narcissist and I was unaware of the this personality trait until we were two years in to the marriage and I was pregnant with my 1st child.  He was an alcoholic and serial cheater.  The alcoholic I garnered at about year 3.  Serial cheater at about year 8.  I found out about a one night stand with a woman who was in our social circle and she ended up pregnant.  I pretended not to know   who the baby-daddy was and played that I was so happy for her, having her first child and all.  She confronted my ex in a bar and tried to get him to leave me and partner up with her but he told her, \"I don't know what you are talking about.  We never hooked up, that kid isn't mine\". (A friend was in hearing distance and relayed the conversation).  I waited until the kid was two months old before I left my ex.  By then she despised him too.  I heard that her kid looks exactly like his sister did at that age.  So to Fat-Jamie, again your welcome. Your kid was better off never knowing Steve.  I saved you both from 27 years of hell. Yea it was difficult to be a single parent, but you knew he was married with kids when you hooked up with him so you got what you deserved.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Note to anyone who says \"why did you marry him\", because narcissists are master manipulators and have the unique ability to hide their true personality until their partner trauma bonds to them.  The man I divorced is nothing like the man I thought I married. To answer \"why did you stay\", because said trauma bond is hard to break.  The hoovering and gaslighting keep you stuck and make you question everything you think you know.  When did I know about the affairs? I learned about the last one right away, and the others came to light shortly after.  Learning about them actually helped me break the trauma bond and then I stayed  an extra year to be petty as F$%&amp; because that woman knew me, and knew my kids.   I don't care if it was a coke-filled drunken rager, karma is a bitch.",

She\u2019s being strangely possessive toward my friend. He isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s up either. Next day at school she\u2019s doing the same thing. Only now she\u2019s being aggressive towards any girl who as much as speaks to my friend. Next day this girl isn\u2019t at school. My gf fills me in how her girlfriend told her the night before that because she sat next to my buddy at the movies, that meant they were \u201cin a relationship\u201d. Ignore the part where he didn\u2019t look her way let alone speak to her because he was cracking jokes with me the entire duration of the movie. She genuinely thought they were an item and on top of that threatened to hurt herself if he didn\u2019t begin showing her the PDA she expects from a bf",

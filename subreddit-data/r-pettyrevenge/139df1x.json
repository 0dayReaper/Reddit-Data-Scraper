    "postText": "I\u2019ve been waiting awhile to remember a good PR or MC story to post. Finally remembered one, compliments of all the breakup/divorce stories recently! This one got a bit longer than I intended, so TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nBackstory:\n\nMy ex-wife was a special kind of lady with that almost unbelievable type of crazy you only see in movies. There was a matching crazy sex drive with it too though. I had caught her cheating multiple times over the few years we were married, as well as doing some pretty hard substance drugs while I traveled for work (and she stayed at home to watch her two kids from a previous marriage and our child). I chose to believe the \u201cI\u2019ll change\u201d stuff too many times (foolishly). Mostly because her older two were like my own, their father had passed from cancer while they were still young. And also because she had my child, and I didn\u2019t want her growing up in a broken home like I did. \n\nOpportunity presented itself for a fresh start with a relocation far away from the rat hole she grew up in with all her connections and bad habits of her past. We agree to move the family there to take a nice promotion and give her a chance to get in a new environment and work towards change. (She didn\u2019t). \n\nThe Act: \n\nFast forward a year and much is still the same as it was. She had taken up redoing furniture to try and sell it instead of getting a real job, which meant spending a lot of time making runs to a local store that resold the donated innards of houses that were being remodeled. There she met\u2026 let\u2019s call him, Javier. She even introduced me to him on one of the visits as the helpful associate who always helps her load up the heaviest stuff she bought into her truck. Needless to say, my Slimy sense was tingling. At this point I had this gut feeling every time she found someone new she was going to eventually cheat on me with. She was mid-30s and afraid to get old and undesirable, so she would pick out guys about 10 years younger so she could still think she had it. Javier fit the bill (and also oddly looked similar to her deceased husband). \n\nRoll forward another 3 months and the arguing was getting too much for me. She also started insinuating that she would lie to CPS that I was touching her children so I would never see my daughter again, or purposefully inflict harm on herself and threaten to say it was me. By this time, I was smart enough to start secretly video recording this stuff with my phone so I could avoid major issues down the road (it ultimately saved me and won me full custody in the divorce, but that\u2019s for another time). \n\nA week later, we fought just prior to Thanksgiving. Not only one of my favorite holidays, but we were all completely alone in terms of family except each other. She started  the fight as a way to go spend it with Javier\u2019s family. I wasn\u2019t aware anything had started on that front yet. Her oldest kids were accustomed to these crazy acts by now and she didn\u2019t fear them telling me. My daughter was only 2. \n\nA couple days later, I found out, after spending a lonesome Thanksgiving with my Hungry Man turkey dinner, what really happened. The fight was huge. I was done and she knew she had gone too far. I was filing for divorce on Monday (it was Saturday). She was able to take one of my texts I sent, after she pulled over on a 4-lane busy road with our youngest so she could kick me out and walk 4 miles home, and convince a police officer to arrest me to get me out of the house for the night. Our city has 24/7 judges though, and I was out by noon on Sunday on $100 bail as it was a nothing charge. She thought I was gone til Monday at minimum. \n\nI didn\u2019t call home. Just took an Uber. I show up and low and behold, Javier had come to spend the night! At this point, it was laughable and I knew what she was capable of, so I video recorded before I even entered the house. He left, then I left as the kids had school coming Monday. Monday, I file for divorce. Tuesday, I appear in court for my initial hearing for the arrest over the weekend. She\u2019s requested a temporary restraining order on me at the hearing, and the courts grant it until the real trial. I was forced out of my home and also forced to keep paying all the bills (except food) while the divorce went on (lawyer\u2019s advice). \n\nI was given 6 hours on Wednesday, by the court, to get as much of my stuff out of the house as I could. I was leaving that same day for a multi-week out of town job too, so I couldn\u2019t really take a lot. Anything I left behind I was at risk of never getting again. \n\nNow, I definitely needed work clothes and some street clothes, but I could maybe only take 2-3 suitcases of things at best. Cue the petty revenge\u2026\n\nThe Revenge: \n\nOver the 4 years we had dated / been married, we had accumulated quite a large collection of fun adult toys. Somewhere in the ballpark of $3000\u2013$4000. And most of it was kept in a big trunk that looked like a magician\u2019s case. Well, that stuff was mine just as much as it was hers. I had bought it all for her. And she loved this stuff (with or without other\u2019s involvement). She kept her favorites hidden in different places though like her closet inside a shoe rack, it was strange. \n\nI packed what I really wanted in about an hour and a half, the. Spent the next two hours searching for all her hidden favorites. I cleaned that place out if anything explicit and tossed it all in the large trunk.\n\nI left with time to spare and the bed of my truck loaded with my work gear, some suitcases, and her special trunk. I drove about 5 hours to get to the hotel of the job I was going on, and after I checked in, I saw the big green dumpster back in the corner. \n\nI pulled my truck around, backed up, and hoisted the 80lb+ monster into the bin and smiled. It wasn\u2019t a lot, but it felt really good to have gotten at least one leg up on her, as I knew she would be furious to not have anything to help her destress from her life about to be falling apart. \n\nTL;DR Wife cheats one too many times, has me arrested on false charges, and kicks me out of my home. I take our giant collection of adult toys and drive them 5 hours away to a hotel for a job and toss them in the dumpster. \n\nBonus/Side Notes: The case was eventually dropped against me when she wrote a letter to the DA stating I was fine and she wasn\u2019t afraid of me. That\u2019s the only way they\u2019d drop it so she could get my help with the kids as she struggled to find work. I wasn\u2019t going to violate that TRO for any reason! I ultimately won full custody of my daughter as well when all was said and done. I have so many more stories from this terrible marriage if you guys liked the above!",

                    "comment": "I\u2019ve long wondered the same. As I said, I walked back to the house. There was an officer just down the block from my house before I got there waiting at a Walgreens. He saw me and stopped me. He asked what was going on. I told him about the fight and showed the messages. We chatted about half an hour. Finally, he said it all seemed good and asked what my plans were. I told him I was going home to get my bag for work and leave for the weekend so I could file for divorce at the start of the week and be done with it all. He said that sounded best. He offered to give me a ride to the house. I declined and said that he should go on up and explain what\u2019s happening while I walked the last little bit, then he could witness me do my thing and leave. \n\nBut unfortunately that wasn\u2019t the end of it. She apparently lost her mind when they said they were going to let me go. By the time I got there (like 10 minutes later), I asked if I was free to enter and have them follow me. They told me to hold up. And there were additional cops pulling up. \n\nI spent the next hour and a half waiting to hear what was going on. Eventually, they came out and asked me to put my hands behind my back. You see, where I live, stuff like this they can\u2019t arrest you unless the District Attorney  is willing to accept a charge they think they can successfully prosecute. So the entire time they were inside my house on the phone with a DA trying to find a charge to get me on. They ultimately landed on something along the lines of \u201cTerroristic Threat - Written\u201d. \n\nThe part that angered me the most was the sergeant high giving his officer right outside my door as I sit in the back of the car and congratulating him for \u201cfinding something\u201d to get me out of the house for the night. Disgusting. \n\nAnd for those who are wondering, the text message in question said something like, \u201cI\u2019m done with this shit. It\u2019s time you suffer the consequences of your actions.\u201d\n\nLooking back, extremely poor word choice against a bipolar narcissist. I should have elaborated what I meant, which was the fact that we were getting a divorce, she would be forced out of the house, and I was going to fight for full custody of my daughter. I have never written a vaguely worded text since!",

He was on them previously and for some fucked up unknown reason his primary doctor decided to let him get off them without a replacement because he gained a lot of weight. His psych was baffled and of course it led to the mess we're in now, which involved a lot of denial and non-compliance with his meds for the majority of the year, so it's taken a long time to convince him to get back on his meds at all. I opened my own bank account without telling him and I've been applying to jobs I can do within school hours because I have an 8 year old, but so far no luck. I'm putting my car in my name and everything when I get paid next week also. I just hate that it has to be this way because all I wanted was a loving family. I just want to live in peace and be happy, but for some fucked up reason it's just not my reality. I'm exhausted.",

Right now he's on Ziprasidone and it's working way better than the Depakote so he'll probably stick to that for the time being. He absolutely needs talk therapy, but he refuses so it's still on hold for now. He had so much trauma to unpack on top of everything else and he's just so resistant to healing. I know I can't force him, but goddamn it's exhausting to fight this shit alone. I stay because I love him so much, but idk how long I can last with everything going on.

The way she is going she will likely face a lonely future as once her looks fade she will find it more likely difficult to flit from partner to partner.\n\nThe fact that she filed false charges on you shows how incredibly toxic she is.\n\nI am glad that you hopefully will no longer have to deal with her in the future and will live your best life without her.\n\nTake care of yourselves and all the best for the future.",

I remember when my parents got divorced, my mom pulled the whole \"he beat and the kids\" which my older brother and I both denied but were ignored. My mom had some of her druggie friends beat her up and so she got full custody despite not being able to pass a drug test for multiple months (meth). The only reason she lost custody was because her bf beat me from head to toe for peeing my pants while my mom was gone getting groceries. I was two years old, at the time. He then locked me out of the hotel room during a snow storm in the mountains of Colorado without a coat. My mom found me and must have called the police or something. So she did at least do something right despite everything else. \n\nEither way my brother and I then spent the next 6 months in foster care before the state finally decided my dad could have full custody. That was undoubtedly the worst 6 months of my life. We went from one shithouse to the next, only the 6th (and last) house we were sent to was okay. Most were religious nutjobs but they all used the foster system to profit from. Most had their own kids that were heavily favored and the foster kids were an afterthought. The only reason we got out was because one of my mom's friends came forward and told the courts that my mom was lying about everything. Had she not done that, idk if CPS would have ever given custody back to my dad. And they continued to try and take us for years after that. I can remember being pulled out of preschool for surprise visits by my CPS case worker. I hated them with a passion. \n\nLooking back on it, idk how my dad didn't snap during the whole process. He is by no means perfect but he certainly stepped up when he had to and I'll always love and respect him for that.",

To thank her for her zero years of loyalty I convinced her that I wanted to work it out. She rescinded the divorce papers. In my own time and ways I scared her favorite boyfriend away forever. He was the one she was going to eventually replace me with. I also slept with 2 of her friends but that was for us. We never told her and to this day(12 years later) she still has not been  told. So after about a month or so of trying to save the marriage( I was actually just gathering intelligence to use in court one day) I went downtown and filed for divorce myself. No warning. No heads up. No clue. I was told she was DEVASTATED. Good. The divorce/custody battle was intense. I walked away with a small monthly support payment and nearly all my child's time while they were actually awake. After school until after dinner. 4 days between M-F and 2 or 3 weekends a month.\nThat really pissed her off. Be a whore. Get treated like a whore. You don't use me while destroying our family because you have daddy issues, dumdum.",

Besides her new man definitely didn't want to use the toys she used with you. If this is a victory for you, I would hate to see what you've lost.",

She already gets $2900/mo from social security for the deceased father for the kids. \n\nAnd he may not have wanted to use them, but she would have continued to do so privately regardless!",

    "postText": "SIL is the kind of mom that always has to one up other kids. She constantly talks about how her kids are smarter, taller, faster etc than her friends' kids. She literally bragged about them peeing more than her friends' kids when they were babies lol.\n\nIt was worse when my husband and I had our twins. Suddenly everything was a competition (that her kids always won). One of my girls rolled over at 4 months, her son had rolled over when he was just a week old. The twins both took their first steps around 13 months, her daughter was RUNNING at 4 months. (She didn\u2019t actually start walking until around 16 months). She even changed the weight of her kids\u2019 birth weights which makes them both heavier than the current heaviest newborn in America. It\u2019s so weird that she feels the need to tell such obvious lies, especially to people who know she\u2019s lying because they were there when her kids were small.\n\nI got annoyed when she went from lying about her own kids to telling me there is something wrong with mine. The girls are a few months shy of 2 and they\u2019re both healthy, on track and hitting their milestones. SIL has become OBSESSED with the idea that there is something wrong with them because they\u2019re not speaking in long sentences. Of course they\u2019re not, they\u2019re not even two! They\u2019re both developmentally on track but she insists that her children were speaking in 5-6 word phrases by 18 months. (Spoiler - they were not). Honestly, her son is almost 7 and I can still barely understand a word the kid says.\n\nMy husband and I ignored her but she took it too far when I got a call from her friend who works in Early Intervention who was under the impression I was very concerned about my children. We talked and her friend confirmed that yes, they are on track and no, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n\nI finally lost my patience. Hey, her kids are breaking almost every record there is and that should be celebrated!\n\nWe had dinner with my husband\u2019s family on Saturday (kids were in another room) and I decided it was the perfect time to give her my gift - a booklet I had printed and laminated called the \u2018White Claw Book of World Records\u2019. I printed all the supposed milestones of her kids, complete with photos and info of the actual world record holders now that they had been pushed to second place. She flipped through the first couple of pages, went beet red and called me an asshole. Her husband took it from her and got through the first page before laughing hysterically and asking her why the hell she was still lying? Apparently it was not the first time they\u2019d talked about her lying about their kids.\n\nShe stormed out but texted me later that night and asked why I\u2019d humiliated her when all she\u2019d ever tried to do was help me get my kids the help they needed, but if that was how I wanted to treat her then she\u2019d stop.\n\nSo I guess it\u2019s a win for me!",

My sister did a lot of the same things to me when our sons were young, and it was pretty apparent she was trying to cover for the fact that her sons were behind on pretty much every milestone while my son was early on most of them - though really, just barely early on all but walking and turning over and those weren't drastically early. He was about a month ahead in most skills. He wasn't setting any records. It's pretty common for only kids raised around almost completely adults to hit some things a little bit early - or a bit late, depending on the adults. \n\nHer younger son was born quite a bit premature and then was very ill for a couple of months around a year old. If you subtracted those months from his actual age, all but his speech was right on target. And that's what caught me in the post. My nephew spoke like a toddler until he was about 10 and peer pressure made him stop. He still did at home into his teens - because that's what got him attention and adoration from his otherwise volatile or negligent mother. As young as 5, when he was at my house without her, he was clearly understandable if still struggling with hard r. That's not unusual at that age. Most kids don't do that well until 6 or 7, so he wasn't even actually delayed in speech. He *could* do it and was making a choice not to, even though I'm sure it wasn't a conscious one. \n\nIf a kid is 7 and not speaking clearly in absence of a disability, I always wonder what that kid's home life is like.",

Blue becomes glue, tomato= tornado. Their speech evaluator asked why i hadn't been concerned, all i could say was \" we figured a good chunk of it would either disappear on its own, or she'd pick up the way the other kids spoke and take that on. we'd spent the last 2 years in near total isolation as the kids we did know either had severely immuno-compromised siblings or their parents weren't taking it even half seriously. We'd had a baby in early 20 right after first lock down.  We didn't have anyone to compare her to.\"\n\nShe then admitted that it's a very common issue she's seeing with this year's kindergarten classes. We'll know after this evaluation if she needs just some help or make it an IEP.",

He still uses diapers and refuses to use the toilet.. I say uses diapers, because he doesn't wear one, he just asks for one when he needs to use the toilet, and she gives him one, he goes off puts in on himself, then squats wherever he happens to be and then asks her to help clean him up. He is also really really weird.. I know that's mean to say about a 6 year old.. he's a good kid.. but definitely an odd ball.\n\nI think she says he's a genius because she knows something is wrong, but is in denial and thinks if she says he's a genius then she doesn't need to acknowledge what is actually wrong with him.

She kept refusing the help of the school and teachers, even as he was increasingly disruptive in class. Eventually at the age of 9 she got him diagnosed because the school essentially forced her hand. The change in the kid has been massive.

            "comment": "Had a similar situation after my first kid was born. Our pediatrician held group \u201cparenting\u201d classes during well-child visits which covered all the usual advice/information about milestones, etc. they were going to tell us all anyways. Then you\u2019d spend 15 mins or so in a private room to cover specifics for your kid and do a physical exam. Everyone in the group is a first-time parent and all the kids are the same age (i.e. all 4 mos, 6 mos, 9 mos). \n\nDuring our 4-month visit, the pediatrician started asking about what milestones they should have and ones they could have attained but are not necessary for their age yet and one of the other parents kept saying their kid was already doing everything they asked about. The pediatrician surmised she was just bragging for the group and asked about a few things a 4-month definitely should not be able to do yet but didn\u2019t include how unusual it would be for her to actually be doing it in the question. She answered her kid was indeed able to do those things. The pediatrician then told her how unusual that was to be occurring at such a young age and that this may mean there was something wrong with her child. They also suggested her kid be the last child evaluated privately because it may take extra time to determine what tests or therapies they may need (They weren\u2019t kidding/lying either. If her kid truly was doing these things that early it could mean something was wrong). Well, that shut her up for the rest of the visit, and never again did she brag about how awesomely amazing her kid was, at least not in the group sessions. \n\nI miss that group of docs. They had separate offices for sick visits and well-child visits. Same building but totally separate offices and this was in 2004.",

            "comment": "Regarding the twin thing: my twlns were very slow to talk (English. To us). The pediatrician told us if they didn't  up their word count by 18 months, he might send them for testing. \n\nWhen they were 17 months old, I was cleaning out a cupboard below the stairs in the laundry room where I keep wrapping paper.  My daughter ran in and saw me. She ran out into the next room, and I could hear her babbling excitedly at her brother. Then they both came running into the laundry room and began laughing when they saw the paper.\n\nClearly she had told him about her exciting discovery and brought him to see it. They could certainly talk. They just didn't bother talking to their parents. \n\nSo tell your SIL that not only do they talk, but they even have their own language.  They just don't share it with adults unless they have to.",

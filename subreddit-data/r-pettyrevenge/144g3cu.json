    "postText": "I joined the Marine Corps straight out of high school. Life goal for me, was all I ever wanted. Looking back now I probably should have thought bigger, but hey who can say they fulfilled their lives dream at 18 years old. I went to Paris Island in the dead of summer so it was hot and muggy. It was my home for the next three months. \n\nAnyone who has been there knows it is not the best place to be. always running back and forth getting chewed out left and right, all in the hopes of making you worth something. Looking back at it now I still wouldn't change a thing. I got there around 140 pounds and left 170. mainly because my senior Drill Instructor couldn't tell the difference between Garcia, and Gonzales so I got his push ups whenever he was at medical or dental.\n\nThe time of day that was the most cherished was night. we would all lay in our rack think/fear of the day ahead and go to sleep. Now if you served in any branch of service you know about fire watch. for those who don't instead of sleeping the whole night certain people on a rotating roster will take a shift walking around the squad bay and recording any irregularities. most people hated it. I only enjoyed it when I had either first or last shift so I would have uninterrupted sleep. so we were issued rifles and every night we would have to secure them with a lock and chain. I don't know how it happened guess I forgot but I somehow managed to not secure my rifle. The recruit who on fire watch was Recruit Johnson (fake name) and instead of waking me up and saying. \"Hey man your rifle isn't secure you might want to fix that.\" he decided to wake up the drill instructor on duty and got me to take his shift of fire watch that night and he got to go back to sleep.\n\nSo I was upset I wasn't on the schedule to have fire watch that night now I would have it like 3 nights in a row. I wanted to get back at Johnson but didn't know how. Until I started Sorting out the laundry. one of the things fire watch would do through out the night was everyone's laundry and roll the skivvies shirts and socks into a grunt roll and place them on each recruits locker. once we wake up we would place them in the locker and get ready for another day in paradise. now Recruit Johnson was tall probably one of the tallest in the platoon. that night and every night I had fire watch i personally made sure all his grunt rolls had size small shirts and skivvy shorts. every night before free time we would have to report that we have no injuries or problems to report while spinning in place to show any wounds while in our skivvies. and almost every night Recruit Johnson was wearing clothes that were way too small. he would always complain in free time saying \"Why do I keep getting Small clothes?\" and everyone would laugh. Me most of all. Its one of my most favorite stories from boot camp and I thought yall might like to read it.",

I have been there and done that,after  boot camp when I made a similar mistake but worse and left my rifle in the fire watch and comm tent, when we were in the field up in the mountain warfare training center, but a kind marine brought it to my tent and though rumours swirled the next day about someone forgetting their rifle but he never opened his mouth nor did I.

Desk marines are usually pretty chill or over the top because they have the lamest job in the marines. \n\nThis dude was a dick and half, expected anyone less than an NCO to greet him every time they passed him like he was a drill instructors with the good morning Sargent crap and even aye Sargent. \n\nOut unit was tight and of course we respected rank but not like it was boot camp. So this dude also pissed people off and he chewed me out once or twice for no reason other than to be a dick, made me stand at parade rest and everything. Not even the Gunny in charge of him asked us to do that crap.\n\nAnyways, I finally got promoted to E4, and we were doing swim Qual and heading back to the bus. When he passed some of the marines on my squad and pulled the same crap of chewing them out, and questioning what they were doing f all that stupid crap. \n\nI heard about it and so I waited until the entire bus was full, got on last and yelled for him to meet me outside the bus, in plain sight of the entire bus if 100 plus marines I ripped him a new one, chewed him out and use words I have never used before. He was red faced and had to apologize to me for disrespecting my marines. It felt so good! I had only been a corporal for a week at the most and this felt so satisfying, I got huge cheers from the whole squad and many other marines in the company. \n\nI never chewed people out or was an ass like that to others, except when they were the bully. I can\u2019t stand big egos like that. that admin never FK with me again\u2026or my squad",

He was red faced and had to apologize to me for disrespecting my marines. It felt so good! I had only been a corporal for a week at the most and this felt so satisfying, I got huge cheers from the whole squad and many other marines\n\nWhen I was an E-5 in the Navy, I was on the phone with a O-6 and was instructing him to do some things that the O-7 I worked for told me to pass on. The O-6 started railing into me telling me that he did not take instructions from an E-5. I actually used the words \"Sir, please do not confuse your rank with my authority. I am speaking on behalf of Admiral xxxxx, and you are instructed to follow these instructions\".   \nIt turns out that he did not follow the instructions and was subsequently relieved of his duty station. \n\nThe instructions had to do with timely notifications to the family of a recently passed sailor during the USS Cole bombing in Yemen many years ago. When he ignored me, that family was almost not notified in time, and there would have been a congressional investigation if said family was not notified in person within 24 hours of passing.",

I only knew I had no clue what direction I was going in so that seemed like a decent option while i figured it out. The summer before I had wrecked my car and was in the hospital for 6 weeks and in a neck brace for several months after that. I wasn't a big guy - 5', 90 lbs before the accident, I was down to 80 by the time I got home. I really only got back to where I was by the time I enlisted. I just couldn't put weight on back then, wish that was still the case.\n\nFt. Jackson, South Carolina, 1975. So I'm the smallest guy in the company, by far. The DS decided that he needed to have some fun with me. Said you're small, dynamite comes in small packages - what does dynamite sound like? I said 'boom'? So everytime he hollered dynamite I had to holler BOOM!\n\nOne night after dinner before lights out I'm in the latrine and I hear Dynamite? I answered BOOM! Went back and forth about 5 or 6 times until the DS showed up wanting to know who was playing his game. Turns out one of my friends was messing with me. DS got him out in front of the barracks in his white t-shirt and boxers at attention in the street tearing him up.\n\nThe barracks were up on piers/posts and you could crawl underneath in that nasty, powdery, dusty dirt. DS said 'Boy, I lost my cigarette under the barracks. Go in there and find it.' 'What brand DS?' 'Parliament!' \n\nAfter about a half hour of crawling in the dirt the DS let him go and he came in and said he would never mess with me again. We laughed about that quite a few times.",

Each one of them has a rifle, a lock, and a key.  Each of them is ordered to lock up their own rifle.\n\nIf you have your rifle, ammunition, and a will to shoot everyone around you, your lock isn't going to stop you. You always have access to your key; you always have access to your rifle. Everyone around you always has access to their own rifles.  \n\nFire watch has no practical purpose.  It exists only to get you to understand that you are on duty 24/7. You may be called upon to do something you find stupid, boring, and useless, while everyone around you is sleeping or having fun. \n\nYou can help your buddy, or you can fuck over your buddy.  They can help you, or they can fuck you over.  One of the more important lessons to learn early on is that **anyone** deliberately choosing to fuck over anyone else makes life deeply unpleasant for everyone.",

In the field, yes, because then you do have actual fire sources burning.\n\n&gt;  I had fire watch i personally made sure all his grunt rolls had size small shirts and skivvy shorts.\n\nSo you had him wearing someone else's underwear? Nasty! And also forcing someone else to wear a different person's undies. Nastier!\n\nEDIT: I guess fire watch in garrison is a common thing in US military basic training. Yet another reason to be happy I'm in the Canadian Forces.",

There were a handful of times I had to reuse dirty briefs because I didn't have any clean ones. The first opportunity they took us to the exchange (think of a small wal mart) I bought a whole brand new pack. The next day all my briefs that had been stuck in that dirty laundry bag must have been washed because I got them all back. Then I had too many pairs \ud83d\ude05",

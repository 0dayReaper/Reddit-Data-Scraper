    "postText": "Hi all. I had a boyfriend, we were together for about two years. When we met, he had just come to my city to go to university, he had no friends, much less relatives, in this city. I won't tell you how it all started, we met and started dating. He lived in the dorms for a while and later started insisting that we move in together. I had my own apartment, but he didn't know about it, he thought I was renting it (Don't ask why I didn't tell him about it, I had my own reasons). In the end I agreed to live together, but I never told him that the apartment was mine (My parents' apartment, which they would buy for me). Of course, he as a gentleman offered to pay the rent of the apartment from his purse, but I said that he shouldn't worry and the apartment is paid by my parents (I remind you that the apartment belongs to my parents). He was a little embarrassed, but he was happy that there would be extra money. So after a year and a half of a relationship that seemed good to me and I always thought that my boyfriend was ready to come to my rescue, I was very wrong. My very distant acquaintance with whom we communicated once a year, sends me messages that wrote him, my boyfriend, they also rarely communicated (if you need proof I can discount).  \nThere was something similar to this (shortened version):  \nMy friend:  \n\\-Hi, how are you? How's it going with HellKittyInHeaven.  \nGuy:  \n\\-It's going great. With HellKittyInHeaven, I want to break it off, but until I find a place to live I'll wait, her parents pay the rent and it's very convenient.  \n(Again, this is a shortened version to get the gist. Their dialogue was much longer)  \nAfter seeing this, I was both sad and hurt and generally disgusted that I had spent so much time with such a person who, because of the benefits can't break up the relationship.  \n**I can't fit everything in, so I'll continue in the comments.**",

A week later I told him that my parents won't be able to pay the rent for a while (I remind you, it's their apartment). I thought he would confess and tell me that he wanted to break up and just leave! But no he said, \"I understand if it's temporary, I'm willing to pay the rent for a while,\" and he paid the rent for 3 months, but in the end he couldn't stand it and gave away everything, what he wrote to our acquaintance. And the same day he moved out of my place. You're probably thinking, \"did she tell him it was her parents' apartment? Of course she did, and his face, and all the horrible words he yelled at me were worth it!",

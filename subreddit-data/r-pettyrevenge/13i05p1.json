    "postText": "The ending of this story happened in late April and involved myself and my former employer. The dust has settled enough that I can post it. Names changed obviously. And, as always, it\u2019s long and detailed, so TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n  \nBackstory:\n\n  \nI work in the service industry for Oil &amp; Gas in a field called Nondestructive Testing (NDT). This involves the inspection of new welds and in-service inspections of existing assets with different methods that don\u2019t damage a part/material to tell its condition. I have been doing this line of work for 10+ years now, and I have progressed myself into a specialized, advanced section of this field.\n\n  \nNow, one thing about my field is that you always encounter troubles with those who put revenue before integrity at all costs. While there is a delicate balance between being profitable or being overzealous as an inspector, there is at least a bare minimum that companies in this field should try and achieve. There are lots of regulations, codes, standards, etc in place to prevent previous \u201cuh-ohs\u201d and \u201cwhoopsies, sorry we blew up \u2018X\u2019 facility, killed a bunch of workers, and poisoned your town\u201d from happening again. \n\n  \nI joined my (now previous) employer in Q1 2022. They are a small to mid-sized NDT company based somewhere between California and New York (ha!). They had traditionally stayed in their lane with more generic methods of NDT, but had a desire to add the specialized services I was experienced in as many clients are demanding it be a part of any service providers list of abilities these days. \n\n  \nPrior to joining, the Company President, Daniel, drove down to meet with me over dinner to discuss my plan for the new service line, the costs, and any other requirements or needs I might have. It boiled down to an equipment budget to start of $160k, a lead technician to work with me to grow the line who would get a guaranteed 40 hours weekly minimum, a reasonable expectation of travel since I have full custody of my daughter (see previous posts for some insight into that), and a commitment to doing our best to do things right.\n\n  \nDaniel was more than agreeable to everything I asked for. Said they wanted to do things right or not at all. Offer letters were cut quickly and accepted, equipment ordered, and off we went!\n\n  \nAbout 2 months in though, the cracks started to begin to appear. More than I could hope to explain here, it became apparent I might have selected the wrong place to call home. I spent much of 2022 dealing with utter chaos. You see, Daniel hates the \u201cCorporate\u201d structure. Loathes it even. He wanted to remain as \u201cMom &amp; Pop\u201d as possible, all while the company generated $75M+ in revenue yearly. There was zero corporate structure at this place. Everyone reported to Daniel for everything, no matter how big or how small. And all managers were expected to be field employees performing work while still coordinating their own employees for the same thing, doing quotes for clients requesting work, and drumming up new clients. \n\n  \nI\u2019m a team player though. I have worked across several parts of Oil &amp; Gas doing what I do, and have the cross-training to do things only a small portion of our field are capable of doing and doing it well. As we got the ball rolling, I jumped in and helped where necessary. I would cover field jobs (local and travel) from the most basic to most advanced stuff we offered, traveled for short turnarounds, client demonstrations, reviewed/revised procedures, did quotes, provided technicians training\u2026 the list goes on. Back to the chaos though\u2026\n\n  \nSo my office had 3 \u201cManagers\u201d in it. I dealt with advanced services. Another dealt with project (longer term, planned) work. The last dealt with the callout work (last minute, no-notice stuff). These other guys are middle level intelligence at best. They\u2019ve fallen into their roles ultimately because they\u2019re \u201cYes\u201d men who never put the client first and will shake your hand while pickpocketing you at the same time. I didn\u2019t know it at first but came to realize it over time. \n\n  \nThey also think the various inspection methods to be performed can be done by anyone with that particular certification, but it\u2019s not always 1:1 in our line of work, and the application of those methods varies greatly by what the client is trying to achieve.\n\n  \nMe though? I\u2019m no \u201cYes\u201d man. I guide the clients when they\u2019re asking for the wrong inspection methods that best suit their end goal, even if it means suggesting a cheaper method. I tell the clients no when they ask for things that we can\u2019t achieve to the standards they put forth to us due to some limiting factor (time, documentation waiving Code requirements from them, etc). And I tell my coworkers, employees, and management what they need to hear whether they like it or not. In the end, all of this is one giant game where you\u2019re balancing on ball while playing chess and having a staring contest at the same time.\n\n  \nI struggled the most with the two other managers out of my office. I helped 7 other offices with anything they needed without issues but these two at my own office were a nightmare. To top it off, Daniel was no help, nor was the owner of the company, when I brought multiple issues and violations to their attention throughout the year. These clowns would book work without knowing what they were quoting out or what it took to do the work right. They\u2019d pile up jobs that were heavily underbid, bid incorrectly, critical information missing, basic information missing (where to be, when to be, site contact), and then they\u2019d drop it all in someone else\u2019s lap and expect them to clean up their mess and handle it. If you didn\u2019t, they\u2019d complain to Daniel, and he would call you yelling at you to get it done without ever asking what was going on. Typically, this would result in an earful from me, hanging up, and eventually him calling back to apologize after he realized what the real story was. Rinse, wash, repeat all year long. \n\n  \nWhen 2022 Christmas bonuses came to everyone in the company, mine was absent. I never got the full reasoning why, but enough was gathered from others that I was 1 of 4 in the company of 400+ that didn\u2019t receive a bonus for \u201cnot being a \u2018Team Player\u2019\u201d aka I made too much noise about quality issues and didn\u2019t just scam our clients out of money they didn\u2019t need to be spending, or delivering a subpar product to capture the revenue at all costs. \n\n  \nThis deflated the wind in my sails overnight. We had quite a bit of success in the first year I was there. We had been busy straight up through Christmas and were hitting the ground running in 2023, which is super rare in Oil &amp; Gas for our field. I had covered an insane amount of field jobs for the company in 2022, boosted our social media presence by a ton, brought on some clients that were working on massive deals for us leading into 2023, and more. \n\n  \nAfter that, I stopped all the extras I had been offering the other managers and offices and refocused solely on my group. It went mostly unnoticed but Daniel, but not by the others in the organization. I relieved a lot of my overall stress for awhile, but 2023 was busy and requiring much more travel of me over the first 3 months of the year. This put a huge strain on my daughter\u2019s mental well being (she\u2019s in Elementary) and began causing behavioral issues at home with my SO when I was gone, and in turn was causing my SO and I to fight a lot about the behavior. \n\n  \nWe had a new employee hired at one of our western-most offices just a couple weeks before I quit. Daniel asked me to go out there to test him out and certify him. I explained my recent issues at home and the need to bring the new employee to me instead. I explained the cost savings it would have for the company due to our pay differences, the fact I wouldn\u2019t lose 2 days of round trip travel driving back and forth to this office with the 300lbs of test equipment and steel test blocks, and the fact I could keep up with my other job tasks for those 2 days of lost travel time as we were drowning in things we needed to do for other clients at the time. None of that mattered though. Daniel wrote back a short reply and said he understood my concerns but he really needed me to go out there to test this guy and that was that. \n\n  \n\\*deep breath\\* Ok\u2026 backstory is over! On to\u2026\n\n  \nThe Act:\n\n  \nOn the day I decided to quit, I got a phone call at lunch from the Callout Manager at my office. He had a big inspection that came up last second that needed done the next morning starting at 7AM in town. This thing was going to take me all day (we work 10 or 12 hour days usually), at minimum. Possibly two days. All my others guys were busy on other work, so I asked for the details and headed to the office to grab some spare equipment. I had to go take some safety orientations after that for a couple of hours. No big deal. \n\n  \nTowards the end of the safety orientations, I get a call from the Projects Manager at my office. He also had a big hot job for a client that needs done first thing the next day. I explain how everyone is busy, including myself, and that I won\u2019t be able to get to it until at least the day after. I gave him some options for bringing technicians from out of state if we really had to cover, and then I went back in to finish my safety orientations. This work would have taken about 4 hours to complete. \n\n  \nAs I left out from training, I noticed an email from the Projects Manager and he had CC\u2019ed Daniel on it as well as my Director of Mechanical Integrity (my true \u201cboss\u201d, but one step below Daniel). The email said that his client was bringing all their parts to be tested to our office and that I could go complete my project for the other manager and then head to the office to complete those inspections that evening. These were specialized tests that needed done that only my department could do and should have been pushed to me to schedule. \n\n  \nUsually, I wouldn\u2019t complain about this. Busy days like this pop up every now and again. It\u2019s par for the course. Do it and move on. But this time, I couldn\u2019t cover it. My SO had a work commitment that was going to hold her over til pretty late in the evening, and I needed to be able to get my daughter from aftercare before they closed at 6:30pm and watch her the rest of the evening. \n\n  \nI \u201creplied all\u201d to the email about my situation, reemphasized that I couldn\u2019t do it, and said to let the client know I could get them done the next morning after my other job. Projects Manager fires back his own \u201creply all\u201d stating that the client will be there to pick them up at 8AM the day after next and that I needed to get the inspections done before that time and he didn\u2019t care how I covered it. I immediately fire back again to everyone that it wasn\u2019t possible for stated reasons and that if he didn\u2019t want to encounter this issue then he should check with me prior to scheduling work for my department without knowing our availability. \n\n  \nCue Daniel\u2026\n\n  \nDaniel calls me within 2 minutes of my last email. He starts off by stating I cannot send anymore \u201crude emails\u201d. He was tired of it\u2026 (I later checked with my MI Director and he laughed and said nothing was rude, just direct and truthful). \n\n  \nThen Daniel proceeds to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t travel to  (City) to test out my new guy. You can\u2019t work after hours. You know\u2026 I\u2019m trying to figure out what it is you CAN do for me?!\u201d After all the field work I\u2019d been bailing him and other departments out on over the last year!\n\n  \nWhen I tell you it took everything in me to not quit at that very second\u2026 whew. I was red hot. We had some more words and we hung up. A few other conversations happened amongst my lead tech, my MI Director, and my SO. Then\u2026\n\n  \nDaniel called back again. This time he was much more calm than before, as he typically does. He said he thought of a plan. He asked if I could go work the first job, drive 45 mins back to pick my daughter up after, then turn around and drive 35 minutes back to our office to complete the other inspections. He said I could either leave my daughter in the truck while I do it, or let her wait in the conference room and watch a movie. Afterwards, he said I could take my daughter to a \u201cnice dinner\u201d and he would pay for it, but made sure to clarify \u201cnot too nice though, you know?\u201d She\u2019s in elementary school!! Nice to her is CiCi\u2019s Pizza!! Did he think she would order an $80 steak somewhere?!\n\n  \nI defeatedly agreed to do as he suggested just so I could get him off the phone and think of what I really wanted to do. He sounded pleased with himself as he hung up, as if he once again solved the problem. \n\n  \nI was torn between quitting or staying. I didn\u2019t want to leave, as several other offices with good people were counting on myself and my department to support their upcoming work. My MI Director and I had been working on building these other branches and slowly trying to change the overall culture at the company through the sheer power of using revenue with high margins as a bargaining tool against upper management to fix their ways or risk losing it all.\n\n  \nThe Revenge:\n\n  \nThat evening, I made my choice and hatched the plan. The only hope this company would ever have to learn to change is to catch them off guard and affect their revenue.\n\n  \nI made dinner and ate with my family that evening. Then I packed my truck up with some other equipment that was in my garage. After my SO got home, I drove over to the office after hours, dropped all my equipment inside, locked up, and left. I waited until 10pm to issue my scathing resignation letter to Daniel. I was sure to CC my MI Director, our Corporate Quality Manager, and our Regional VP on it as well so they\u2019d know what was said. I pointed out every last issue the company had from the top down, office to office, and department to department. I went into detail on various managers actions and the lack of action from upper management that lead to my decision. \n\n  \nBut most importantly, and pettily, I left them with zero time to prepare anyone else to be able to cover the two, extremely hot jobs they were supposed to have covered the next day. And the nearest available technician was over 9 hours drive away. Sure, I only affected them for that day in the worst way possible, but it was the best exit I could ever have hoped to give at that nightmare clown circus!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \nTL;DR: Boss overworks me, lets other managers run wild booking work in my dept they know nothing about, doesn\u2019t respect my full custody deal, and ultimately treats and talks to me like crap on the last day. Two hot jobs need done for clients the next day. I wait until after hours to drop all equipment back to our office and send out a late night resignation letter to upper management to leave them screwed and scrambling to cover.",

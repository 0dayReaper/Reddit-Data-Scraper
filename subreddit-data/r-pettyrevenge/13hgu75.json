    "postText": "We live EIGHT HOUSES (and we're talking big yard houses) from a house that has a four-horse stable in their backyard. They were grandfathered in from decades ago, and generally we enjoy seeing them work the horses and just having the horses around. No big deal, just a nice neighborhood addition. Then, they decided to start playing music at 5 pm on Sunday. Music so loud we could hear the words inside our house with the windows closed.  Now, loud music in an evening I could ignore, but this was ongoing at 2 am. It kept my toddler up, it kept us up, and we had work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeighbors reported them multiple times, their direct neighbor put notices on our doors telling us it was NOT them, but gave the correct address of the neighbors that WERE being butts. We reported them. They'd get a fine, cops would stop by, and then 2 am the next Monday they're keeping the neighborhood awake and we've got people on Nextdoor asking about the source, people who are BLOCKS away.  That's how bad it was.  \n\n\nI married for brains and it was successful. Hubby has an 8 foot potato gun with angle finder and laser sight. Great for taking to the lake or out to the farm, never unpacked in town until we were sick and tired of the jerk neighbors. At 11 pm, it gets dug out, sighted in carefully, and remember how they have horses? There are some corrugated-metal buildings and roofs.  Husband has very good aim and could absolutely hit the broad side of a barn. We could hear the godawful BANG! as a solid raw chunk of potato slammed into the side of one of those buildings.   \n\n\nThe music turned off immediately. And each weekend when it goes on? The decibels are appropriate. We can hear the music when outside, but not inside a closed house on the opposite side, and it shuts off by around 9 pm. Technically still illegally loud but not when people are sleeping and not so loud we can't ignore it.  \n\n\nWe keep a stash of potatoes around just in case though.",

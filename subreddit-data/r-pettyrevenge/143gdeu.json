    "postText": "My brother (well over 20s) still lives with us. He uses everything I own to the point I have to lock it up with three locks. Our parents only tell him to stop, but he never does. A couples weeks ago, I was fed up. I had just got home from school and decided that I would leave some stuff out. But, the stuff was deodorant and soap. I went to the bathroom to unleash the most messiest bowel movement ever (Yes i wiped, not that you think the next part is grosser than it actually is) and turned the shower on, but before I went in I rubbed the deodorant on my buttocks and put it back for him to use. In the shower, I took the bar of soap and rubbed it on my bum as well. I really scrubbed. Have fun using my stuff. Never steal sibling\u2019s items.",

Both of them work by rubbing off onto your skin, so there's really not any residue left over. \n\nAlso, I can sympathize. I had an older sibling who stole shit from me all the time. They stole my Sega Genesis game console when they left for college, they stole dozens of my CDs -- I put stickers with my name written on them under the disc and later you could see where they tried to scratch it off but obviously couldn't get all of it -- and who knows what else of mine they stole that I may have never noticed. So, I fully applaud your intent, you just need to rethink the methods.",

So I passed him a can of hair spray (a roll-over from the 80s, what can i say, and I don't think I've used any since then)! He thanked me and took it to his room. A couple of minutes later he knocked again and said if made a mistake and given him hair spray, I said I knew and was wondering if he'd notice before or after he used it. Oh well, it would have been funny if he hadn't.",

    "postText": "\nThis story takes place a few years ago- before I was the legal drinking age. \nI was on vacation in Hawaii. I went to go have my hair straightened several days on that trip, my hair could really not handle the humidity change. I went to this hair salon that had a full bar, so you could drink while you got your blowout / styling. I sat down in the chair, the hairdresser asked me if I wanted a drink. I responded no, because I was only 19. Then the bartender came over, and asked if I would be drinking today, the hairdresser answered him \u201cshe\u2019s only 19\u201d. He scoffed \u201cfigures, you look like you\u2019re 12.\u201d I did take this a little offensively, he asked if I wanted anything at all, I said make me whatever. He brought back a butterfly pea lemonade (purple lemonade). It had hurt my confidence a little bit, at the time I possibly wasn\u2019t as developed. I went back to get my hair straightened again, 3 days later. The bartender welcomed me in because I was now a familiar face. I sat down with the hairdresser and she began taking care of my hair. The bartender came over and asked what I\u2019d be having, so I said make me whatever. He brought back a pink colored drink. I drank it, I did notice it seemed overly sweet, but i didn\u2019t think much of it. I finished the drink, and after my hair was done he brought the bill. I asked I have to pay for the drink? (I didn\u2019t have to pay for my virgin beverage last time). He was like ??? Yes?? I said \u201cyou gave me alcohol? I\u2019m 19.\u201d he was shocked. He ripped up the bill right in front of me. He pleaded with me not to tell the boss or anything, and I agreed. I asked him don\u2019t you remember making fun of me a few days ago? and he couldn\u2019t remember the interaction. drinking on the job maybe? who knows. and I left the salon with one cocktail in me and my hair done. Things always play out how they\u2019re supposed to.",

I\u2019ve been studying for the MCAT, so I needed a bit of stress relief. So why not troll these scammers since they already like to waste people\u2019s times and try to rip off money? \n\nThe exchange went like this: \n\nLiar liar pants on fire: Hey\n\nMe: who\u2019s this\n\nScrub from the other side: I\u2019m  Zoey. Are you 45 years old Andy?\n\nMe: *thinking to myself how do you fail to introduce yourself without typos* \n\nAlso Me thinking let\u2019s troll: Andeez nuts\n\nBusted person: Oh sorry, I got the wrong number, I wasn\u2019t careful. Andy he is the business partner of our business. Hope it doesn\u2019t bother you\n\nAnyways short and simple. Stupidly petty but yay. Also, there\u2019s no way people refer to business partners in terms of age XD.",

If it's the \"you recently had an accident\" type call - I say \"yes how did you know\" etc and keep them going for as long as possible (presuming of course I have time available myself) until I can take it no further and when asked to list my injuries, I tell them that I was pronounced dead at the scene\n\n2. Again I string them along as much as possible and at some point when I've had enough I will ask if I can help them bring Jesus into their lives, but I will continue with the most outlandish extreme religious stances possible and will continually interrupt withoffers to pick them up and drive them to my church this weekend - which is always located near to their home as it doesn't actually exist I can claim it's anywhere. Basically I play the religious nut and they soon back off.\n\n3. Finally I've had a lot of fun and success with letting them carry on their script for a while whilst cueing up the best needy and wimpish voice I can. I will say something like I'm very lonely, I don't have any friends - important pause here - \"will YOU be my friend\"  they either hang up and that's fine or they try to lie and say of course they're your friend. That leaves the door open to spending their time trying to stop you getting them to arrange nights out or weekends away at fictitious events  - great fun listening to them trying to get things back in line with their planned script.",

I make sure to answer the questions the computer asks correctly so I get transferred to a live agent. Then the fun begins.\n\nThey ask me my age and I tell them something in the range of 63 to 85. Not my real age, of course. Then they go into their spiel of the free stuff I will be getting. I wait patiently until they ask for my name. I make one up on the spot, usually pure gibberish. (Being quick witted is a plus). Then as they are getting ready to sign me up, I tell them I need to spell my name for them, just to be sure they have it correctly, because I don't want someone else to get my free goodies. Sometimes I have to convince them to let me spell my name. I insist, and they resign to let me spell it out, since they think they have a live one.\n\nAnd that is where the fun begins. Remember I said some gibberish as my name? Well, I'm not going to spell that out.\n\nInstead I spell out something like \"F U C K Y O U A S S H O L E.\" I laugh maniacally as they hang up on me. I wasted their time, and made them think they had an easy mark. They are criminals, they don't deserve any respect or tolerance.",

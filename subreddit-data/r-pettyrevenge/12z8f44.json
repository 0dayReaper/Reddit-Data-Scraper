    "postText": "A few years back - my friends and I bought 10 seats at a sold out showing of some marvel movie on opening day. This was before the theatre started making every ticket purchase have an assigned seat. So we got there super early and were in the front of the queue. We were there long enough to talk to darn near every employee there.\n\nWhen released, we rushed to the middle and \u201creserved\u201d (with jackets) 5 seats on one role, and 5 right above. I stayed in the above-center seat to ward off any seat pirates\u2026 or\u2026 whatever. The rest of my friends went for popcorn and drinks. People are starting to trickle in.\n\nWhile playing on my phone, a woman in an ugly red hat came by and started scooping up the coats in front of me. She was followed by 3 kids (who probably shouldn\u2019t have been in this PG-13 movie, but whatever.)\n\n\u201cExcuse me, those are taken.\u201d I said\n\n\u201cMind your business.\u201d She replied, as she unceremoniously dumped my friends coats on the end of the row and put her kids jackets down in the middle seats.\n\nI was in awe. A wild Karen just took our seats and I was kinda in shock. I looked around at other patrons in a \u2018are you **also** seeing this?\u2019 Kinda way.\n\nShe took her kids to go get popcorn (presumably) and as soon as she rounded the corner I went into action.\n\nI scooped up Karen\u2019s coats, ran down to the front of the theatre and put the jackets in the most god awful seats imaginable. Front seats and to the far right. Then returned my friend\u2019s coats to their proper places.\n\nMy friends got back pretty quick after that, which was good because I was dreading facing this horrible woman alone. I told them what had happened, and they all laughed - saying had it been THEM that saw it, things would\u2019ve ended differently.\n\nThe the lady comes back and sees that my friends are sitting where she wanted and starts fuming. I point to the front row and tell her, \u201cyour coats are down there.\u201d She storms out. People continue to stream into the theatre.\n\nShe comes back with the manager, points to us, points to the seats she now has and starts loudly complaining. I excuse myself to go listen closer as the lights started to dim for the previews.\n\nThe manager, who had seen us several times while we were in line, stops the lady in the middle of her rant and says something along the lines of \u201cthese guys have been here for hours, if you moved their coats and they moved them back - that\u2019s on you - now take your seat - the movie\u2019s starting.\u201d\n\nShe begrudgingly had to sit in those seats up front because by now, every last seat was taken. \n\nEvery time there was a solar flare or bright flash on the screen I could see that lady in that stupid hat with her kids, staring up at the screen at a ungodly angle. She left as soon as the credits hit and we had a good laugh about it afterwards.",

That\u2019s totally fair. \n\nThe fact that she did the exact same thing but didn\u2019t even leave a \u201cguard\u201d behind like you is hilarious",

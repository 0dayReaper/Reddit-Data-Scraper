    "postText": "A few years back my husband used to work for a car dealership as a lot man. He maintains the car lot and this includes parking and inventory. He\u2019s so good at his job that he parks cars perfectly lined up with just under a foot between each car.\n\nAnyway, my husband\u2019s brother had a big shindig birthday party. It was held at a restaurant in a small strip plaza with limited parking available. When we arrived the lot was almost full and the only available spot we can find that will fit our vehicle was right beside a commercial garbage bin at the farthest corner of the lot.\n\nFor context we drove a quad cab with an 8 ft bed. \n\nIt would have been a perfect spot for us if not for the garbage bin and the entitled driver of a Toyota Supra who parked just over the line to discourage other cars from parking beside him.\n\nThe car was parked nose in so the driver side door was facing the spot where we wanted to park.  My husband made us get off and backed in leaving just about a foot clearance on each side. Our truck was also long enough that he was able to park that the driver side door was just jutting out letting him exit with ease. \n\nDuring the party, my husband would step out to go for a smoke. On one of these trips out he saw the very irate tall driver (about 6\u2019 or more) getting into the passenger side of his Toyota Supra. When I asked my husband if he moved the truck to help. He said no because it was so funny watching the guy cuss up a storm while trying to wiggle through his car.\n\nEdit: the truck was a base model 2x4 not a 4x4 or AWD, we have 3 younger children at the time, we do a lot of camping or outdoorsy activities and buying this vehicle made more sense because it fit our needs and was a lot cheaper than buying your standard minivan.",

Let me propose a hypothetical situation that has been very real for many people.\n\nYou're driving down a two lane country road, one lane in each direction, doing 30 or 40 MPH. You've got your kids in the back. A sedan, driving in the opposite direction, drifts into your lane last second. Why? They're texting, or maybe just an idiot, doesn't matter. Let's say your driver reacts and tries to swerve out of the way, like most people would. Your front left tire hits the sedans fromt left bumper. Your truck is both taller and heavier, with larger tires, so your front end goes up in the air.\n\nThe other driver **will** either die or get seriously injured when your vehicle mounts his and shoves your tire in his face. But now your vehicle is unbalanced, and due to the height and momentum, you flip and roll. At 30 MPH. It doesn't matter how nice or new your truck is, the roof will crumple inwards like a can and throw all of you around inside the cab, causing serious injury.\n\nSo in the end, because you chose to drive an unnecessarily large ***work vehicle*** as a daily driving vehicle, you have one person who is most likely dead and an entire cab full of injured or dead people/kids.\n\nYes, everyone would still be injured if you were driving a station wagon instead, but the risk of death becomes minimal, whereas with an SUV or a pickup truck death has a high probability of occuring *in both vehicles.* See, the thing about North America and vehicles is, they don't have to safety test against a variety of different sized vehicles. No, they only safety test against similar-sized vehicles, ie SUV vs SUV. They pass those safety tests as they're designed to, but if you do thay same test with an SUV and a sedan, it fails. Miserably.\n\nSo in the end you have an entire continent full of people driving SUVs and pickups as daily drivers, increasing the risk that *everyone* takes when they get behind the wheel and drive somewhere. That's why I dislike seeing so many SUVs on the road, not only are they more dangerous in almost every potential aspect, but they're also completely unnecessary. \"I have kids and need lots of cargo space!\" Well, station wagons have more space for cargo and people than an SUV. \"But I'm concerned for my safety!\" Well, station wagons are safer for *literally everyone*, yourself included! The next excuse I always hear is \"but I like being in a taller vehicle\", and that is just pure selfishness. Someone who thinks it's fine to endanger other people just because they feel better being higher up is someone who should not be driving on the road.",

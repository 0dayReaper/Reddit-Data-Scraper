    "postText": "This story begins in my grade 10 year of high school when I was roughly 16 (currently 20M). I'll refer to myself as Jake.\n\nI left my highschool for a year to do a special program and unfortunately had to leave most of my friends at my old highschool. The \"ringleader\" of the friend group, i.e. the person who brought us all together, I'll call Gary. Gary and I were pretty great friends ( or at least I thought we were), I even almost got him to apply for the same program I went to, but in the end, he never did.\n\nThroughout the grade 10 year, we would hang out every once in a while with our friend group, but slowly overtime, I didn't get invites. I was distraught, these were my closest friends and I expected to go right back to their friendship when I returned to my school after the program was finished.\n\nWell, to spare the details, the summer before grade 11 I barely saw Gary, and in addition, most of my other friends. I saw some of them without Gary, but it almost felt like Gary was gatekeeping them from me. Either way, I got some pretty deep depression from it, as I went through the whole \"you're not worth it\", \"everyone hates you\" BS.\n\nSo I decided to just let it go. I made other friends in highschool, and I rarely spoke to Gary for the rest of my pre-university schooling. I was satisfied that maybe the friendship had just changed, and there was never anything malicious behind it, and I had gotten over my depression.\n\nEnter Gary's ex-girlfriend in senior year. Let's call her Beth.\n\nBeth began to date a friend of mine that I had made post Gary's cunty antics. She immediately thought I was a d-bag because of what Gary had told her about me back when they were dating in grade 10 and 11. Turns out, Gary was bad mouthing me to a lot of people. I eventually won Beth over and we became friendly. And then Beth showed me the texts between them when they were dating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Jake keeps asking me to hang out. He's so fucking annoying\"\n\n\"Jake keeps trying to sit with us at lunch, so I just ignore him to try and make him leave\"\n\n\"I told Jake I was hanging out with you because I didn't want to see him, just so you know\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole time Beth would always ask him why he never liked me. Beth told me there was never any clear answer and it was always just \"he's so annoying\", or something along those lines. \n\nI was shocked. I thought maybe I had been overreacting and that friendships just change and maybe we had grown apart. Learning that he truly disliked me for seemingly no reason made me mad. Very mad. Even to give him the benefit of the doubt, if I was being a douche or something along those lines, he never explained it to me, telling me to stop, which is what a true friend would have done. And I was also still fairly close to the rest of the people in the friend group, meaning I hadn't irked any of them at all. Because he brought upon a very difficult time in my life, I wanted to do something, but everyone in my life, including my therapist, told me to ignore it and be the bigger person. They told me that that happened in grade 10 and you are a senior now. You have new friends and are happier than you've ever been, so why go back down that road? They made good points, so I decided to follow that advice. But an elephant never forgets.\n\nCue petty revenge. I now work for a company that is in need of new software for their operations. My role includes doing a lot of research into each software and determining the very specific differences between them, even though, as I've learned, many of them have roughly the same functionality for our needs. Nevertheless, in an effort to be thorough, I'm doing everything I can to get as much detail as possible.\n\nMany of the software companies will give you access to demos and informational videos of their software if you give them your email and phone number. But they never actually require you to *confirm* your email or phone number.\n\nThe first time I accessed a software's information they almost immediately started berating me with emails and calls. It was ridiculous. So I had the idea to finally get my petty revenge, more than 5 years later.\n\nI used Gary's email and phone number for every single software I researched. And I researched a ton. He's probably drowning in calls coming from people who want 15 minutes of his time to setup a meeting to go over the hottest new features of their software.\n\nThe cherry on top? They always ask me to give a company name. Every time I state the company as Creative Urbanized Network Technology, or C.U.N.T. for short.",

It was made worse by my so called friend showing everyone where I lived and even bringing them to my house..\n\nA nightmare incident involved one of them trying to put my head through a window and then a couple of them attacked me the next day because the first guy was expelled..\n\nAnother incident that shouldn't have been allowed was been hit on the head a few times with a rubber mallet..Teacher did Jack all about it, just took their mallet away (Not sure it was smart to give a bunch of teens hammers, even if they were rubber)..\n\nNo matter what happened, my so called friend and his new group of friends made everything my fault..They got detention for leaving school grounds during school hours..My fault..They had a bad time in a lesson..My fault..Their locker wouldn't work..My fault..They made life hell and nobody cared..Teachers ignored them, parents weren't interested..\n\nThe only good times I had were when I caught one of them alone while I was with my cousin and one of his friends..He ran away after we took some revenge on him..The second time was during a lesson when one of them was seated right behind me and kept kicking my chair, trying to grab all my supplies, punching me in the back..I turned around and jammed my compass (The sharp pointy thing used to help draw circles) into their hand..I got in trouble for that one..\n\nBeen a long time since school, I still live with the torment though..Not really had any friends since then, depression really rocked me to my core, got scars on my arms..\n\nGood on you though for doing something, even if it was years later..Good to see Karma coming back and biting people on the arse.",

    "postText": "This only just happened today, but he doesn\u2019t know about it\u2026yet. So I (20F) have a Barnes and Noble membership, which is about to expire. My 1st brother (referred to as K) brought up pitching in some money for the new membership that B&amp;N introduced, since most of my family uses my account to get the discount. My 2nd brother (referred as L) didn\u2019t understand before K clarified. L said that he didn\u2019t go often anyways and \u201cshe can afford it\u201d (this phrasing bugged K and eventually my parents), before I pitched in saying, \u201cthe point is that everyone uses it.\u201d\nFor context, my brothers do NOT have my membership card, bc L doesn\u2019t live at home and K travels often. Since they don\u2019t have my membership card, they can just tell the cashier my phone number and the system will find my membership through that and get the discount. So for my little petty revenge, since L decided to be a smartass, I changed my account phone number to my dad\u2019s instead (with his permission of course). So hopefully when he does go in and tells them my phone number, the system won\u2019t find it. Now it\u2019s just the waiting game until he realizes.",

This means that if we win a large amount they'll end up millionaires because we'd share it, but if they...they will never play it, so we'll never benefit from it from them. That's not fair! And we can't not give them some of our winnings if it happened. This could also be said about other relatives and friends: they'd benefit from us gambling our money, but we won't benefit because they don't/won't gamble on it.",

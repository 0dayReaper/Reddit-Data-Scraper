    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure if this constitutes as revenge, but it was hilarious timing and my mother certainly earned it. I was talking about this story with my grandfather the other day, and hopefully someone else will get a chuckle out of it. \n\nI have chronic migraines. I get sinus headaches and infections like they\u2019re going out of style. It\u2019s been this way my whole life and is an issue that runs in my family.\n\nI got my first gnarly migraine at the ripe age of 8 years old. I was in so much pain. I couldn\u2019t open my eyes, I could hardly move. That added with having so spend the day with my narcissistic, drug-addict mother made for a real fun filled day!\n\nI remember it was about midday, I was laying on the couch with a blanket over my head. Just wishing the pain would go away. My mother was in a terrible mood since she had to miss work and (*gasp*) take care of me. (Due to her lack of parenting, I essentially raised myself and was pretty self-sufficient; so whenever she had to be an actual parent, she was none too pleased). \n\nAnyway, she asked me if I was hungry and I shook my head no. She didn\u2019t bother looking at me and yelled at me, \u201cWHAT?! ARE. YOU. HUNGRY?!\u201d I shook my head no again. \n\nShe then says, \u201cAll you have is a f*cking headache. You can open your mouth and use your words.\u201d\n\nOh boy did I. As soon as I opened my mouth, I projectile vomited across the whole living room. The distance made was actually pretty impressive. \n\nObviously that made her more angry. She rushed me to the restroom so I could wash up and spent a good amount of time cleaning up the payback my body felt she deserved. \n\nYounger me felt so guilty. Twenty years later I laugh. I haven\u2019t spoken to her in over 4 years and am so glad I made the decision to go no contact.\n\nEdit: wow, I didn\u2019t expect so many people to respond and relate! Thanks for all the advice y\u2019all!",

I've got a travel pillow that has a vibrating pack in it, and I use that. I just rest my head on it, turn it on and sleep while it does its thing. It takes about 30 minutes to an hour to get rid of the migraine, depending on how severe it is, of course. No idea of that would help you at all, but it's my way of killing the pain without using medication. I'll still take the pills, if needed, of course.",

I get migraines with auras, so they have a timeline and progression of symptoms. And it seems to start with my eyes going all funny. And the last one right before it ends, is usually me puking. So, idk if the puking causes the migraine to get better, or if it's just the symptom right before the end, timeline wise.\n\nI hope that made sense. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05",

Now the migraines went away for the most part (I still get a couple a year, but they are relatively mild) after my doc took me off hormones for menopause in the 90s.  I mean immediately; it was astounding.  I started using the nasal rinse with the squeeze bottle in 2005 or 2006.  I have had exactly one sinus infection since, in 2009, and it was mild, too.\n\nI should mention that for years I was a virtual pharmacy, trying many migraine medications.  None worked permanently, and after I developed hypertension I was forbidden to take prescription meds.  Aleve works well for me, but I have to be very careful because of multiple health conditions.  I will only take a couple if I am desperate.\n\nI recently had a couple of ocular migraines!  Hadn\u2019t had one for years, and mine are painless.  That\u2019s the official term for the migraines with the \u201cblurry vision and jagged edges.\u201d  They can be painful, like a regular migraine, but in my case only the first one was painful.  I had no idea what was happening (I was driving) and it was very scary.  I saw a neurologist shortly afterward, and he had no idea what I was talking about!",

I started seeing a psychiatrist in my 30\u2019s and one of the drugs she gave me for depression also works for headaches. First time in my life I had a day w/o a headache. I\u2019m in my 70\u2019s now and it\u2019s still working. The sad thing is that my son has migraines.

            "comment": "My theory is a bit different from others here. \n\nI think the pain is what drives the vomiting. Most doctors I've seen for my own migraines say that pain can trigger vomiting. Once you get to about a 8 or 9 on the pain scale, it's hard to move because even moving feels like it makes it worse. Small noises like the phone ringing or birds chirping feel like daggers in your eyes. Add in someone screaming at you, and the screaming pushes you from an 8 to a9 where vomiting often occurs. \n\nOn the old pain scale drawings, that face was actually green and showed the face vomiting!\n\nSo I think your mom literally was taking what she sowed!  Your body was just reacting to her noise, and you were just asking for the ride. It's not like you could swallow it while you were in the act or somehow stop it.  \n\nOP, I hope she didn't yell at you for messing up the floor! I'm so sorry for all you suffered. \n\nIf you like hugs here's a giant one, asking with some hair stroking and \"I'm so proud of you and the person you've grown into. Considering you practically raised yourself, that's twice as impressive!!\"",

Usually the only thing that will help is taking some Ibuprofen, closing all the curtains or blinds, turning off all the lights and sleeping for a few hrs.

Plus, all my right side was numb and one of the times, after the crisis, the right side of my mouth was lower that the left side. My mother took me to a neurologist because I could have some vascular problems, did all the exams, Tomography was in its early days, but couldn't find anything. Some years after I noticed that my migranes only hapen when I was very stressed and had done nothing to release or avoid what was causing me to get stressed.  So, you have to find what makes you stressed out, and avoid those enviroments/people.",

I stoped drinking animal milk and it got better, but as soon as I got into a place with AC, I could feel my nose getting blocked... first step to a big sinus headache!! I've mooved to a tropical country, I still avoid AC, but the weather it's not so dry, on the contrary, but I do love that I haven't had a sinus headache since 2007!!",

I knew I had a migraine. I washed my face and mouth out and went to Uscan which had our manager on duty and the Uscan/cashier manager at. CM turned to me and said time for your break to which I turned to our MOD and said I need to go home as I have a migraine. MOD said, go get your till and I'll clock you out, see if your coworker will cover for you, to which she did. I got my till and put it in the system and collected my stuff from my locker and sat down on the bench by guest services, called my dad to find out that he had taken a pain killer five minutes before, so he would not be of any help for me. I don't recall what happened but I ended up passing out and when I came to I rushed for the trash can and threw up in it. I drove home pulling off the road and puking maybe every ten minutes. I got home and my dad gave me some of my over the counter pain relievers and two wet wash clothes for my forehead and my neck and told me to sleep, which I did for the next 10 hours.  \n\n\nIf I did not sit down when I did, I would have passed out in the parking lot and at night, no one knew I had passed out on the bench, no one came to check on me when my cane fell to the ground.  \n\n\nI seriously \\*HATE\\* migraines, especially the ones which makes you throw up constantly for the next 2 hours.",

His sibs had same issue so we recommended same thing. Apparently their issue was hereditary. 20yrs later he knows when blood pressure is higher than normal because he'll get headache. Not a cure for most but couldn't hurt to discuss with your doctor. Ours still requires him to keep BP logs &amp; regular visits.",

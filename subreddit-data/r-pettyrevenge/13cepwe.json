    "postText": "Years ago, late 80's my college put me in off campus housing. The apartments were ancient, and 2 people were assigned per bedroom. The girl who I originally planned on housing with, dropped out just as the semester was to begin. So for a few days, I was on my own. Since I wasn't on campus, and the apartment had a kitchen, I knew I'd be preparing my own food.  I also knew I'd need to take care of my own transportation to and from campus, as the campus bus was not reliable. So I got a part time job at a department store, for expenses.\nThen  ... the room mate shows up.\nI was at school to, study, learn stuff. Millie, the room mate, she had other plans. Her parents gave her a substantial allowance, not to mention a brand new car.  But.... she NEVER had money for food.  She'd take my food, then offer to share what she spent her money on with me. The problem was, she spent her money on 2 things; drugs and scientology.  I wasn't interested in either. I avoided my apartment as much as I could. I didn't need to be around THAT.  My Nana was local, so I spent much of my time at her house, unless it was inconvenient  due to class schedule and work.  Millie's parents were world travelers. They were very wealthy, and made sure that everyone knew it.  Millie had all sorts of things around the apartment that her parents had gotten for her, and she made sure that I knew the value of all of it. When I removed the small television I had brought with me (I took it to my Nana's, hers broke) within a day, she had the latest model delivered.  But she told me I wasn't allowed to watch it. Millie also decided to move her friend in, since I was never really there.  As far as the school was concerned, I lived there.\nSo now it's Christmas.  Time to leave for the end of the semester.  I have no plans of returning, but I don't tell anyone.  Since I still was registered to the apartment, I had to check out  with housing. I got my RA, walked into my apartment  ... and it was beyond trashed. By his body language, I  got the impression that he already knew how bad it was. Drug paraphernalia.  Empty bottles.  A complete drug den. If a cop had seen that, I would have immediately been arrested. The RA tells me I better have the place cleaned before he gets back from class.  I have no idea where my room mate is, this was before cellphones, so I couldn't call her.  But, I did call a friend. We threw out EVERYTHING in that apartment that wasn't there when I originally got there. Coffee table items? Into a trash bag. (The TV remote may have been on the table).  Expensive silk pillows her parents had brought back from the Orient? In a trash bag. Lamps and fans? Trash bags. Couch blankets? Trash bag.  Rug on floor? Trash bag. Since I WAS leaving and I didn't want to have bugs, all the food? In trash bags. All her Expensive health / beauty etc. stuff in the bathroom, yep! Trash bag.  Even her prescriptions. Everything that was not there when I got there, everything that the school did not provide for  the apartments.  I threw out in the dumpster. I knew the schedule for pick up, and I knew that the dumpster would be emptied the next morning.  I left the clothes in the closets, and the beds made.  \nAnd then, after I scrubbed the h*ll out of the kitchen   and the bathroom, we squeezed silicon down the drains.  Opened up every single door (bedroom, bathroom, closets) and put a strip of sealant (heavy duty glue) on both the tops of the doors, and down the hinge side.  I left the cleaning supplies on the counter, to show they had been used. \nThen we got the RA to inspect AGAIN. As he had looked in each area, I asked him to pull the door shut. And he did. Sealing each door as he shut it.",

    "postText": "I (M23) am a disability support worker and I'm with my client on a film project for 4 days. Because it's far away we booked a hotel to stay at. When we arrived we checked in and discovered our room was up a flight of stairs. My client is in a wheelchair. \nWe checked the website which states the rooms are 'accessible' and we complain and get a room change.\nBoth of us feeling the frustration of another place excluding disability we went straight to the bathroom and raided all the shampoos and conditioners (there were about 10 bottles).\nIt's not much but it did put a smile on my clients face so worth it in the end.\n\nTLDR hotel for my client with disability lied about hotel accessibility so we took all the shampoos which cheered up my client",

So they went downstairs again to complain that this couldn't possibly be the wheelchair accessible room. It wasn't, that one was given away that morning and they had no other rooms available. Manager was called and the smug asshole berated my parents for not informing them of my dad's handicap before. My father pulled out 6 printed mails: the one before they booked where he told about his handicap and asking if they can accomodate his needs, the reply that confirmed it would not be a problem. The official reservation which stated again his handicap and needs, and the confirmation where the needs were acknowledged. Finally, his e-mail one week before, reminding them of his reservation and needs and asking if they are still able to accomodate him (no refurbishments happening etc) and the reply that confirmed once more that it would not be a problem and they looked forward to giving him a first class stay at their hotel. That wiped the smile of the manager's face. The people who had been given the wheelchair accessible room had left the hotel to go sightseeing and staff had to enter the room and get all their luggage, so my parents could go there. I hope these people gave the manager a hard time about that.",

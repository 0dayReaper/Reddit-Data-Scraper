    "postText": "This is toward my narcissistic mother(68f). Our relationship hasn't been doing well in the first place our whole lives and ever since my wife has met her, she shined a lot more light to leave my mother no contact.\n\nMany stories but one of the main ones was when I was a teen and had retainers, it was what kept my teeth aligned. My dad was up keeping everything to make sure I have great teeth but since their divorce, my mother basically had him move away from us and never saw us again. But that's a whole different story. My mother threw away my retainers just because she thought it was \"disgusting\" and now my teeth have gone back to where it was before I had my braces. That happened when I was 16 and when she complained about how bad my teeth looked years later, I brought up that she threw away my retainers and she always said back, \"I don't remember that\" Therefore to her, it never happened and I should not bring it up again.\n\nShe used that on my wife last year when she gaslighted us and showed her true colors. My mother bought a lot of toys for our son. We declined so many times so much that it was kind of hard to accept because it took a lot of space. We decided to give them away to other people we know that has kids. Once my mother found out, she told our extended family that we threw them away and loved being ungrateful. My wife couldnt stand her and told her that she is never allowed to come back. I agreed. I never reached her again to talk about it but several months later, my mother called me and tried to play it off cool like it never happened. I told her I dont want to speak to her because of the rumor she spread to our family and wouldnt you know? She stated, \"I dont remember that\".\n\nI had enough. I told her that she has been showing toxic traits my whole life and I dont want her grandson to be part of that like how I was. I even mentioned she's the reason why I had countless therapy sessions. My mother kept bringing up all the times she took care of me during her divorce and paid part of my college tuition.\n\nI told her \"I dont remember that. That means that never happened\". Hung up on her and even told the rest of the family on my side to fuck off unless if they ever want to hear from my side.",

            "comment": "I read your post early this morning and have been pondering it all day.  The subject of alienation is something I am learning a lot about lately. Let me make the point up front that I don't know you and cannot know what you and your mom went through for the 20+ years you were in her care. Family dynamics are so complex that even the individuals involved don't recognize all the factors at play.  If I take your post literally, you are cutting off your mom because she threw away your retainers and bought too many toys for your children. Now hold up! Many family items can be discarded accidentally (moving, cleaning, thinking \"he doesn't use them anyway so why keep them anymore\". I don't know, but this should not be a deal breaker to cut off your mom over. You will throw away or lose many of your children's possessions over the years - it happens. And she may well NOT remember what happened.  As far as giving your children too many toys - come on! That's a damned if you do damned if you don't position to put your mom into.  As far as your spouse not liking your mom - this is very common.  Marriage does not automatically confer upon the spouse the same love and affection as the natural child has for its parents. However, when your spouse requires you to reject your parent because they don't like them - this can be a very big red flag in the long run. I know it is useful to go back to that old adage that you should cling to the spouse above the parent, etc.  And there is some truth to that. But most loving spouses have bigger hearts than this. They know the in-laws are different than their parents, but they love you, so they try to love your parents. It may not always be ideal, but expecting a total cut off over such minor incidents indicates that this spouse does not have a very big heart. Once you are more isolated from your support system, your spouse will be in complete control of you emotionally. That can be dangerous for you over time. You may not be able to flourish as a complete adult because you always must check with the spouse's opinions first. Just saying - I'm older and have seen this many a time. Having said all this, I think these excuses for cutting off your mom are just your \"go to\" excuses.  When I read more carefully, you are a child of divorce.  The divorce probably ended your more carefree childhood (I have no idea how acrimonious it was but it is never painfree for anyone in the family). You got cut off from your father (whether that was his doing, wanting a more carefree existence, or your mom's / don't know), but you are blaming her. That's what is really wrong. It isn't that she buys too many toys for your kids (think about it - that makes NO sense). It's that you were left with her and you preferred your dad. You idolized him, Of course he was the sexy carefree one (maybe). I don't know all that. But when you give such thin excuses and then your mom still doesn't understand why you are cutting her off - isn't it a bit your fault too? Start being real about the situation. Start being more humble about yourself. You are a parent now yourself. You are going to make so many mistakes its like a train coming right at you. You can't even prevent it. Do you wish to show your children that you forgive and still love - or do you wish to show them that \"off with your head\" is the way to go?  What do you want for a legacy?",

This is a result of parents who care about your future \"self\" because they care that you have straight and good teeth to compete with everyone else who has good teeth. You are now an adult, married, with children of your own.  Why in the world would you hold your mother responsible for your retainers now?  How selfish and self centered are you? Your parents gave you the advantage of straight teeth and you blame them (when you are older) for not having your retainers? Your parents didn't leave you on the side of the road to fend for yourself - they didn't sell you to human traffickers, you didn't grow up in a war zone - you were raised in a middle class American home where your needs were met - and now you reject your mother like she's a criminal because she can't produce the artifacts of your youth upon demand? You, my son, are the one who needs help.",

It\u2019s been almost two years since I last spoke with her. When I initially stopped speaking with her I was also told how I was emotionally abusive by not responding.

    "postText": "About 2 years ago I had this boss who was a typical micro-manager - would time how long you took in the toilet, wouldn't let you even say hello to your co-workers in the morning, denied me annual leave while complaining that I had too much leave stockpiled, called me non-stop on the one day I did have off and got upset because I wouldn't answer my phone, forced hugs on me when I'm not a hugger etc etc. I was thankful when she got moved on to a different department. Well this week I finally got my petty revenge. I ran into an old family friend this week out socially and turns out old boss had applied to work for them. I didn't lie when asked what they were like as a manager, just explained my experience with them. Family friend is now not hiring them and I don't feel bad.",

I also got along well with the chief.  There was nothing she could do to me, and every time she tried she would get smacked down.  The other employees were too cowed to speak out, sadly.",

Newer to the company, had a lot of experience in the type of work, but was a horrible fit for the company culture, which is ironic because she came from a pressure cooker of a job to a much gentler version of the type of work we do (basically we allow the customers to walk all over us) but have brutal stats to maintain. \n\nAnywho... I had been there over a decade and she couldn't meet the stats. I knew my job, do it well and had high stats as it was. When she couldn't mentor me into higher stats, she gave me a package of accounts to tank my stats and then decided I had an attitude problem. I was going to be her proof to upper management that she could mentor her people to success. She picked the wrong one. I skip leveled my way to upper management and let's just say, I made it, she didn't.",

The icing on the cake is his damned alert sound when he gets a PM in Slack.  it is turned up so loud that we get to hear this every few minutes all day long.  I got my revenge on him this week.  He made the mistake of leaving his laptop on his desk and going home early.  I opened it up in a closet and Snip Snip, cut the speaker wires and then glued them back together so they would not connect but still looked connected.  It has been glorious not to have to listen to that noise constantly.  I asked IT on the DL to not replace his laptop because he was driving us all crazy with that constant ping.

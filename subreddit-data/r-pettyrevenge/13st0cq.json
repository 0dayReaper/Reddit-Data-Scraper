    "postText": "So you've surely heard the stories of wrong numbers gone hilarious. I never thought I'd ever have the luck or incredible frustration of dealing with what was an intentionally wrong number on contact info. \n\nI DO NOT CONSENT TO THIS POST/STORY BEING USED ON TIKTOK OR ANY OTHER PLATFORM.\n\nThis is a long post, filled with the details only a born storyteller would give for MAXIMUM hilarity. TLDR will be at the bottom of the post. \n\nThis was about 7 or 8 years ago, and I'd gotten a new number. I had accepted the fact that I'd be telling people for a few months that such and such changed their number. That's just life. \n\nUnfortunately for me, it seems that the previous owner of the number decided to continue using it for all kinds of BAD financial decisions. So I was constantly being harassed by debt collectors who wouldn't understand that I wasn't \"R\". \n\nIt all came to a head after about 8 months of various companies calling, specifically a very well known cruise line that \"R\" had racked up unpaid bills to. \n\nWho WOULD NOT STOP CALLING ME. By this point, I was pregnant and getting calls from the cruise line all throughout my work day, and on into 9pm at night. \n\nEVERY. SINGLE. DAY. \n\nOne debt collector called so much that we knew each other's voices instantly.\n\nFed up, I called the cruise line back that very night, punching in anything that would get me past the robot and to a human. Of whom I proceeded to civilly let loose on, on their manager, that I was a heavily pregnant woman, being constantly, daily harassed, and it would not stop. The man assigned to the case had refused to give me to a manager on his end, and I wanted it to STOP IMMEDIATELY or I would personally see to it that my family, who frequently used said cruise line, would take our money elsewhere. Namely, their competition!\n\nThe calls from the cruise line ended, but not all of the OTHER debt collectors. Those I continued to put up with for nearly a year. \n\nDAILY!\n\nUntil the day an \"old friend\" began texting. I told her repeatedly that she had a wrong number, and that the person she was looking for, had a new one. To please stop contacting me. \n\nI tried to convince her for at least half a day, but she was ADAMANT that her good college friend, her BEST FRIEND, would never change her number without telling her and I was just pranking her. \n\nSince she wouldn't be reasoned with, and even threatened to stop by \"my house\" to tell me off for not dropping the prank... I figured revenge was in order. CLEARLY the previous owner hadn't moved in several years, so why not pass a message along?\n\nI told this lady that she was right, I was just joking. I really was who she thought, and that since she found me out, she was invited to my party that night!\n\nTold her I and a bunch of our old buddies were having an old college blow out, lots of alcohol, male entertainers, and food galore. \n\nShe was so excited for the party, she offered to pick up anything I needed, provided that I paid her back... Of COURSE I would!! With a bit of interest for her fuel and time, just bring the receipts! \n\nShe picked up ice, several bottles of alcohol and a few other odds and ends before going to \"my house\". \n\nI got by the minute updates from her as she traversed the city, gotten past a bad wreck, etc. I updated with how hot the male entertainers were, and how she was missing out.\n\nSoon I was getting texts about how she was at the door knocking, could see my car, and I needed to answer! Why wouldn't I open the door?! \n\nI told her I was in the back for a \"private show\", and to knock harder, one of the others would let her in! \n\nSure enough, about 5 mins pass before my phone is blown up with her cussing me out. How I was cruel, hateful, and a terrible human for leading her on. \n\nI reminded her that I ***did try*** to tell her, but she refused to accept that her bestest buddy had changed her number. \n\nAnd since she was already there.... To tell her buddy that MULTIPLE debt collectors were VERY interested in talking to her friend whom she was standing next to, to please let her know I wanted her to STOP using her old phone number for all of her shiney brand new and already maxed out credit cards she was getting every month. \n\nPlease and thank you! \n\nI was cussed a few more times as she headed back to the store to return the alcohol no one would pay for, with the receipts I'd told her to keep. (I'm not a total monster after all!!) Before being permanently blocked.\n\nApparently the message did get across, because the very next week I noticed a decrease in harassing calls. Within a month, the only people who called me, were my own friends and family.\n\nI kept that number for years and never heard another peep from all of those collectors looking for her. \n\nI still laugh about it today, all of these years later. \n\nTLDR: Woman intentionally racks up extreme debt, uses her old phone number for a year on all contact information which she got rid of. \n\nAfter being harassed by debt collectors for months on end, demanding that I admit I was her and pay the extreme bills, one of her old college friends hits the scene. \n\nAfter refusing to understand that her friend changed her number a year previously, and her threatening to come to \"my house\" to tell me off for pulling such a horrible prank, I send her on a shopping spree for an imaginary party.\n\nShe shows up to the ex friend's house, beats on the door until she opens up and demands to party. Chaos ensued. \n\nI politely asked her to tell her bestest buddy ever, to please STOP USING MY NUMBER FOR ALL OF THE INSANE DEBT!! \n\nAll debt collectors stopped calling me within 30 days.",

Except, hubby and I lived with them 2004-2008 when I was very ill. Somehow my number got attached to their address. For literally 10 years I got 12-15 calls a day. And night. Because I'm on the east coast they'd call at 11:30pm. The most in one day was 27. They constantly filled my voicemail with nonsense. In the beginning I'd answer and explain, but it changed nothing. The only ones that stopped woke my husband up by calling at 11:45pm and I went off on them violating the telemarketing laws (I had told them previously that it wasn't my home and I lived across the country). The woman was terrified of being reported, and that 1 company stopped. My parents sold the house nearly 5 years ago. I still got 2 calls today. I'm done trying. If they want to waste their time telemarketing someone 3,000 miles away, who never owned the house in question, they are more than welcome to my voicemail.",

I repeated myself, adding u didn't speak Spanish and hoping he hearing anything but Spanish would click. I forget who hung up first but she called again again two more times. Every time I said in clear English wrong number and I don't speak Spanish. On the third I finally remembered enough of my school- taught Spanish to cobble together something like 'lo siento, no numero,  no hablo Espa\u00f1ol, solo hablo Ingles.\" (I'm sorry, not number, I don't speak Spanish, I only speak English.)

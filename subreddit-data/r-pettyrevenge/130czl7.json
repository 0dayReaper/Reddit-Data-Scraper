    "postText": "So, this was\u2026fuck, I guess 10 years ago now? Damn, time flies. Anyhow, set the scene; Riviera Maya, Mexico. We\u2019re on our honeymoon at an all inclusive resort. We\u2019ve been having a blast, but the wife and I were playing small pranks back and forth. They were harmless in nature, like hiding my hat or stealing the towels, but I admit, she got me good when she locked herself in the bathroom and took the TV remote while turning the volume up on the \u201ccomplimentary porn channel\u201d to max.\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to go nuclear or anything, but I needed a good reprisal. Well, there\u2019s a second porn channel available, of exclusively gay porn, which was not her cup of tea. You know those resort channels that play at hotels that usually show nearby attractions or shows in the area? That was playing in the background without sound as we browsed a resort dinner menu. While she was distracted, I switched it to the gay porn channel and let it play out as we continued menu browsing. It was probably playing for a good 5 minutes straight. The TV was in her peripheral vision, but she didn\u2019t catch on, until\u2026I imagine a very repetitive movement drew her attention. While I\u2019m stone-cold staring at this menu, I suddenly hear her yell out \u201cOoooooooh, COME ON!!!\u201d \n\nFor my slyness and ability to keep a poker face, I was given the win, and the prank war was over. I still laugh about it to this day.",

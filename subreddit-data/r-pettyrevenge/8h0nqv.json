    "postText": "My petty revenge story is a little gross, so I apologize in advance.\n\n\nI have a sensitivity/intolerance to most meats. Red meat is the worst, and beef is particularly bad. Doctors recommended I try to get my protein from alternative sources if possible, so I\u2019ve happily been a vegetarian since I was 13 or so. \n\n\nWhen I was younger, my aunt did not believe the doctors, and thought I was just being fussy. We come from a meat and potatoes town, so she had plenty of friends backing her up on this. This is the same aunt who convinced my parents I was faking asthma (turns out, I wasn\u2019t...shocker), and also refused to get her own daughter glasses because she thought she just wanted them for attention (she later discovered her daughter\u2019s eyesight was atrocious... another shocker, I know). \n\nThe whole family regularly had dinner together, taking turns hosting. When it was my aunt\u2019s turn to host she assured me my burger was meatless. As you probably guessed, it was not.\n\n\nI was starving that night and gulped down my (beef) burger first. My aunt was smiling, and I thought it was simply because I liked her cooking. Looking back, I realize her little smirk was because she thought she had caught me in a lie or achieved whatever her end game was.\n\n\nWell, a few minutes passed and I got that familiar, unpleasant feeling in my stomach. It was then that I realized what she had done, and why she was smiling.\n\n\nWhen I eat meat, I almost always get sick. I just can\u2019t hold it down.\n\n\nSo, when it came time to kneel before the porcelain throne, I decided to stay put. I instead took aim at my aunt, who was seated beside me at the head of the table.",

Even some restaurants will fail to realize.  Some asian or Thai foods, for instance, use dried ground shrimp.  It's delicious - but Mom can't have it.  Ask if it has shrimp, and they'll 'forget' about the dried shrimp and only respond that there's no regular shrimp.  They just don't think about the whole dish, just the main ingredients.\n\nSo Mom has to be super-vigilant.  Fortunately that's her only allergy.  She can have regular fish, so she's not entirely blocked from all seafood.\n\nI know someone who is allergic to fish with scales.  No clue why or how that's possible, but that is his allergy.  I didn't try to test it though.  I knew another who said he was allergic to bell peppers.  Fine.  I hate bell peppers anyway, so no problem.\n\nBut yes, shellfish is pretty famous as a food allergy.",

At a shop window in Mitsukoshi I thought I was ordering a sandwich, which it was, but I couldn't see that there was raw fish inside.  I'm fine with sushi and raw fish, but I like to know in advance if it's in there so I can decide if I want that particular combo.  It was a little weird, but hey, it's Japan.  Had I been at all sensitive, it would have been pretty epic.\n\nI hear you on the cooking surfaces.  Most upscale places will be very careful, but it's the smaller ethnic places that sometimes don't understand, so when Mom's around we avoid those.  We just don't like to have to explain things over and over only for them to misunderstand or not realize that they're using an ingredient that is on the list of stuff she can't have.\n\nA friend of mine's kid developed (of all things) an allergy to citric acid.  I personally think it may have been more along the lines of a fungus allergy, because commercial production of citric acid does not involve actual citrus - it's made with mold (fermentation with the fungus Aspergillus niger and the yeasts of Candida spp).\n\nTurns out, lots of things use citrus acid, and there's no way to distinguish the source.  So he broke out in hives from eating tomato sauce over pasta.  After my friend took a closer look at the label, he realized it had citric acid.  So it can be super-hard to figure shit like this out.\n\nThey moved before I could have him test my theory - commercial citric acid made with fungus/mold vs. actual lemon or lime juice - but it would have been interesting to see.\n",

This we learned the first year of law school.\n\nAssault is putting someone in fear of being harmed.  If I waved a baseball bat at you, you saw the bat and understood it to be a threat against your life and/or safety, that would be assault.\n\nBattery would be if I hit you with the bat.\n\nWhich is why assault and battery often go together in a crime.  The victim is often put in fear of harm before the actual harm happens.\n\nIn this story, it would simply be battery.  The OP was not put in fear of the food before eating it, however, it caused actual harm, so it is battery.\n\n(These definitions will change slightly depending on what state you\u2019re in; each defines assault and battery a little differently.  But when you talk about these crimes in general, this is the correct use.)",

The fucker refused to take me to a doctor because I \"was faking it.\"\n\nOddly enough, he never fed me strawberries after that.\n\nReally though, I don't understand adults who insist that kids eat things they don't want to eat. Sure, if the kid refuses to touch anything on their plate, that might be a problem, but if the kid takes a solid two bites and says, \"I don't want to eat anymore of this,\" they shouldn't have to.\n\nWith my dad and stepmom, again as a younger kid, I was forced to finish a plate of canned green beans that tasted absolutely foul. I choked it down and promptly threw it back up on the table. My stepmom never forced me to eat anything after that.",

Except the pain and fever kept going, for a month. Mom took me back multiple times in the next month,  every other doctor looked at his diagnosis and said constipation take a different laxative.  One nurse practitioner questioned it because my abdomen was soft, she couldn't feel any stool. In all this time 1 set of xrays were taken, no blood tests, nothing else. I couldn't go to school because of the fever.\n\nAnyway, it's been a month of pain and fever when the vomiting starts.  Get taken took the clinic and it's original doctor. I could feel the need to puke coming so I decided to aim for his stupid white coat, unfortunately he recognized the puke signs and handed me a basin and I didn't want to get in trouble as my mom was there.\n\nTurns out it was a viral infection but by the time any blood tests were run they could no longer identify the virus, just that it had been there. But I got to puke multiple times a day for over a month after that day and now, 11 years later, there are still foods I avoid and things I have to spit out because they can set off my gag reflex. My former favorite dish at a local chinese place makes me nauseous just thinking about (texture of the meat set me off and now I can't even try it again).",

We started out in Kansas, so it wasn\u2019t a problem, but after moving to Louisiana it showed up at meals regularly. I tried to tell my parents I felt bad after eating it (some kind of respiratory reaction that felt like I\u2019d been punched in the back), but my dad thought I was lying for attention and forced me to eat it anyway. \n\nEach exposure made the reaction worse, but I had to conceal the effects to avoid being spanked for faking, until I wound up in the ER, going into anaphylactic shock. He still acts like I somehow managed to put one over on him, or somehow tricked everyone successfully, and rolls his eyes if the subject comes up. ",

    "postText": "This was some years ago. And I had landed a cooking gig at a not-yet open location of this wildly popular grocery store here. Think of Whole Foods' prepared food section - preparing cold case items and on-the-spot requests; cooking for the hot bar; preparing and maintaining the salad bar. \n\nAs I mentioned, the location I was to be working at was not yet ready to open. Being that all staff was already hired, the company decided to spread us out among their already operating stores (this would be their first as a Whole Foods competitor, meaning there wasn't a position for me since that section didn't even exist yet). So I was placed in the deli - slicing meats and cheeses all day long. We \"transplants\" were also hired at a higher wage than the already established workers. This, of course became a source of many issues and as overall toxic environment. \n\nAnyway, to the point. One day, I happened to be on my period but had no tampons with me. We were allowed bathroom breaks and a lunch break - when we were allowed to do our own shopping. It's not like my period could wait till my lunch. \n\n\"Well,\" I thought, \"how convenient for me! I work in a grocery store!\" I dashed to grab them and pay and then go to the bathroom.  I was efficient and fast. \n\nUnfortunately for me, one of the other workers, who already hated us for the aforementioned reasons (and I swear, as a trickle down attitude from the actual manager of my section - he and I had already had several yelling matches in his office at this point) **tattled on me to the manager.** When he confronted me about it, I decided I'd step onto the customer side of the counter, which was mad busy at the time - and loudly yell: I HAD TO BUY **TAMPONS** BECAUSE I'M ON MY **PERIOD**!! (Knowing that women's bodily functions are highly \"offensive\").\n\nEveryone's staring, mouth agape. I then rip off my deli shoes, hair net, and apron and throw them in the trash can right there and then. Then I through the \"deuces\" sideways peace sign, declare \"In out!\" and walked out!\n\nDamn it felt good. I hated that job so fucking much and it wasn't AT ALL the type of work I was hired to do, solely because it was tangentially related to prepared foods.\n\nEdit: thought I might add that this was around 2010 and by \"higher wages\" I mean $10/hr. Better than minimum wage at the time ($7.25/hr - in the States). Still not really livable.\n\nEdit: part in bold added for clarity (and because it was an unfinished sentence, lol)",

My periods were not consistent and for years I had to throw out numerous clothing due to the surprise. I went to the restroom because I started my period unexpectedly and he confronted me in a passive aggressive way (he also liked to talk to others like they\u2019re stupid which really aggravated me), so I told him I\u2019m detail exactly what I had to do and everyone stood around with their mouth dropped. He never asked me again why I took a restroom break again.\n\nI applaud you on speaking up!! Hopefully they won\u2019t be like that to the next woman (or man) doing what they\u2019re allowed to on their break!",

The Nordic schools have a break between every lesson (so 45 min lesson followed by 15 min break), or at least in every 1,5 hours (2x 45 min lessons back-to-back, usually popular at the end of the day because it allows kids to go home sooner). It's assumed that nobody can really concentrate for more than 1,5 hours straight anyway, so everyone's told to go out and get some fresh air between lessons.\n\nThe only issue here are that every now and then there are teenage girls who refuse to use school toilets (because they smell like school toilets, maybe?), wait for getting home and end up with UTI. Oh, and teenagers who try to get out of going out, wanting to hang out in the hallways instead.\n\nSo, I am confused. Can you clarify a bit?",

The entire school had six different buildings set up by subject matter (all the math classes in one building, history in another, etc.) yet they think all the girls attending can do their thing in five minutes and still get to class on time.

But the schools around here work like this: \n\n75 minute class, 15 minute break    \n75 minute class, 90 minute lunch break    \n75 minute class, 15 minute break    \n75 minute class (no break because it's the end of the day)\n\nSo we do have breaks but I don't agree with the administration that it's possible for kids to always wait until the breaks. \n\nThe administration figures that they have breaks and that's when they should use the bathroom...but if you're drinking water throughout the class (which should be encouraged), you might have to use the bathroom earlier than your break. I think that's totally reasonable considering how long the classes are. In addition, a period can start at any time. If a girl's period started 30 minutes into class I think it's cruel to force her to sit there for another 45 minutes without letting her use the washroom to clean up/get a pad or tampon. \n\nIf a kid asks to go to the bathroom at the same time every day, or routinely takes 25 minutes then I would have a chat with them (e.g. one student was always wandering the hallway when she was supposed to be in the bathroom). But most kids go and come back, no issues. I think it's ridiculous for me to tell a child that they can't use the bathroom when they need to. \n\nI usually don't let them go at the same time, like if Jimmy asks to go and he goes and then 1 minute later his best friend Tommy wants to go, I wouldn't let Tommy go until Jimmy came back, especially if I knew they'd probably be fooling around in the bathroom or the hallway. \n\nBut I think that's much more reasonable than telling them that they simply can't go.",

(So teachers can actually pee or you can do some last minute photocopying.)\n\nWe also don't start until 9:00 am every day. It means we don't end until 4:00 pm but tbh I'm okay with that, I think the later start is better.  \n\nMy one major issue is that I think 75 minutes is too long. I definitely notice that they lose focus after ~45-50 minutes. \n\nIf it were up to me, I would shorten the lunch break to an hour and have 6 50 minute classes with 10 minute breaks, like this:    \n\n9:10-10:00 class (followed by 10 minute break)    \n10:10-11:00 (10 min break)    \n11:10-12:00 (followed by 60 minute lunch break)    \n1:00-1:50 (10 min break)    \n2:00-2:50 (10 min break)    \n3:00-3:50 (end of day)\n\nI think that would be a nice balance that would give kids a real break and maximize their focus and we wouldn't lose any instructional minutes.

Our school was divided into 3 lunch shifts, each at 30 minutes. That meant you would either have lunch right before the third class, in the middle of the third class, or right after the third class. Lunch was the only time I really had as a proper break, with time to stop aty locker. The 5 minutes between classes was barely enough time to get from one classroom to another.",

American schools exist to train American workers, so we have very few rights and lots of arbitrary rules designed mostly to teach the kids to know their place and not stand up to authority figures.\n\nMy school was considered a good one. We had 44 minute classes with 4 minutes between each. The school was spread out and all four of those minutes were needed to get between classes unless you were super lucky and had two classes near each other one after another. If you needed to use the bathroom at any point during the day, you had to either go during class or show up late for class.",

Tights weren't allowed, even if you could find ones that were thick and warm instead of just opaque nylon. The thermometer might be hovering close to 0\u00b0F, but little girls still had to walk to school and go out on the playground with bare legs. My school also so poorly heated that in order for my fingers to work I would tuck my hands in between my thighs to warm them. And some asshole kid told the teacher that I was masturbating. The school called my mother, and my mother spoke to me about it. My mother was very non-confrontational normally, but she went boiling back to that school. I don't know what she said or did, but I started wearing pants to school. I still don't wear dresses.",

They can set reasonable restrictions, and conversations about why those restrictions need an exception on individual basis can happen behind closed doors, but to confront you in front of coworkers like that is extremely inappropriate.\n\nAs far as those restrictions go, OSHA standards are pretty vague and are addressed on an individual basis with employers when called into question. Waiting an hour into your shift? That's... Extreme. I don't know how long ago this happened for you, but in the future I'd look into it. There's a reason Amazon designed an algorithm that punished you for down time regardless of it being for a pee break or chit chatting with a coworker rather than banning pee breaks.\n\nI've only had one job that imposed bathroom restrictions beyond \"don't abuse it\", and that was only in response to an expensive amount of people who would clock in then spend the next 30 minutes in the bathroom. Or spend the last 30 minutes of a shift with the porcelain throne. The same people, every day.",

So by the time the line lightened up I had soaked through my tampon, pad, skirt, and tights, into my not so ergonomic office chair. And dripped blood all over the marble floors down the stairs and to the bathroom one floor below us where the bathrooms were. \n\nSo horrifyingly humiliating, and I felt bad because one of the security guards cleaned it up by the time I got back with my wet clothes that I had to quickly try to clean in the bathroom sink.",

They were behind me after the assembly and I just heard  a loud \u201coh my god!\u201d.  None of my classmates laughed or anything but it was mortifying. \n\n I went straight to the main office and explained what happened and asked them to call my older sister who was at home.  The nurses office with a private restroom was just off of the main office so I cleaned up and got a tampon, while I waited for her to bring fresh clothes.  The hero SECRETARY who was horrified on my behalf told me they were alerting the principal (male), who promptly called in my teacher and yelled at her for a solid 5 minutes.  The teacher never looked me in the eye again.  I ended up getting a doctor\u2019s note on file so that I could use the bathroom as needed.  FFS it shouldn\u2019t have even been necessary.",

Peeing and periods are so inconvenient.\n\nMy biggest gripe is when going to a doctor's office and they have no hook on the door.

Absolutely unbelievable that late in the century people still heated their homes with coal, but in this backward area there were still a few houses that needed coal. I'm still ignorant about the type of coal used so I think that the truck was never swept clean and there must have been years worth of coal dust at the bottom that was scraped off while I was shoveling. In winter time I would make deliveries and would be covered in coal dust looking like I was a minor in a Pennsylvania coal mine. One day I had an important test in class and didn't have time to clean up. My professor was a nightmare who was untouchable because he was teaching at my school for 40 years. He asked me why I  was 2 minutes late to class. I shook myself off and released so much coal dust in the air that the room had to empty. It was literally like an old Warner Bros cartoon. The best part about it was the professor had his breakfast on his desk that he was going to eat after he handed out the test booklets. So much of the dust landed on his breakfast / lunch. Such a shame that I accidentally shook right near his meal. (I made $17.50 an hour in 1979 which was good money back then and the truck was ancient with no easy way to get the coal into customers basements )",

No problem; I sat at the very end of the table, leaving three other spaces.  I ordered my lunch and sat there minding my own business.\n\nA couple of women arrived soon after, and politely asked if they could sit at two of the free spaces next to me.  No problem.\n\nThen, when I was just starting to eat my lunch, two other people arrived to join them.  There was only one other free seat left, so what did they do?  Yep, asked me to move somewhere else.  The cafe is full, I\u2019m in the middle of my meal, and I was here before any of them.  I politely refused.\n\nNow they\u2019re carrying on about how selfish I\u2019m being, taking up the entire communal table when I\u2019m only one person.  They\u2019re watching me eat, willing me to finish and leave.  Fuck \u2018em.  Once I\u2019ve finished eating, I\u2019m going to order a coffee, linger over it, and then order a slice of cake.",

In the USA, an 84% tip would be extremely over-tipping.\n\nThe comment you replied to, adding on the .2 percent extra, is making an additional play on words with gratuity (the tip) and gratuitous (excessive without cause)\n\nHope this helps!",

He was so nice and polite and totally understood me being crazy busy. he orders and just as i put his order in, this group of 2 walk in, pass the host cause they saw their friends in a booth which happen to be next to this guy.  the friends were in my best friend's section.\n\nthese two karens decided he had to leave because they wanted to be next to their friends \"friends were a 4 top  so the 2 girls were not gonna fit in the friend's booth and no way in hell was i blocking the walk way by playing 2 damn chairs at the end of the booth or even a table at the end of the booth for them.... thats a fire hazard!\"\n\nAnyways, that pissed me off so i told the 2  karens \"im sorry but we are packed and we have a wait list, you need to go back up front and wait like everyone else\"  you would have think i made a field goal with their kitten with the look they gave me.  the guy was gonna cancel and leave but i said no, Sir you stay where you are and take alllllllll the time you need. I made sure he stayed a while...\n\nI gave him a side salad.. so he had more to eat. When he finished, i gave him a dessert.  My best friend and I always watched each others back so she made sure his drink was always full  when i couldnt. We had a newspaper behind the counter.... I gave it to him to read.\n\nHe knew what i was doing. He thought it was funny. He said he would pay for everything, but i told him \" oh no...just pay for your meal you ordered... you are doing a HUGE favor for me by sitting here cause no way in HELL do i want them in my section!  their friends surprisingly didnt have the guts to say anything. By the time those two got sat, \"on the other side of the restaurant\"  the 4 top were leaving for their movie.\n\nthe guy became my awesome regular.  always tipped a lot as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you all soooooo much for the rewards, upvotes and comments!! It means so much to me!! It was great waking up to all these notifications and comments and seeing your own stories! Thank you all again! &lt;3 &lt;3",

Keep in mind that revolutions tend to get started by mobs of hungry people and you see the reason behind this.\n\nOf course, all of the above does not apply to the US. The government of the US has been hijacked by corporations and individuals with serious bank accounts whose only interest is to squeeze that last dime out that last poor pauper.",

We tried telling the server but she said she doesn't split checks. I get that policy for groups that are, you know, together and I was like yeah, you can put the four of us together but we don't know those people and have never seen them before in our lives. To which the server replied, we don't split checks here. Literally nothing I said could convince her that they, being strangers, should have a separate tab. It was very weird.\n\nEdit: everyone's asking what happened. I was afraid to say I asked for the manager but I asked for the manager. They fixed it.",

The host was new and unsure of how to proceed, but I spoke up and shut them down.  She offered to move, and I told her straight away that it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if they had been a party of ten who would sit if she didn\u2019t, we love her and no one\u2019s taking precious Mrs. Dolly\u2019s table.",

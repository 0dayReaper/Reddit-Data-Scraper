    "postText": "The post about my husband taking care of our \"Rock Concert All Night Every Sunday Night\" reminded me of another \"he doesn't put up with shit\" action that happens every few months. We live behind an elementary school, on the other side of our fence is their playground parking lot, basketball court, slides, all of that. Great for our kid, the neighborhood kids come to pet the dogs and hold the chickens and ducks, just a really nice set up. Sometimes we get teens parking back there. Most of the time it's just kids finding a good spot to make out or hang out and we're fine with that. They're quiet and not at all a problem and we'd rather have them chilling in a school parking lot than getting up to trouble.  \n\n\nSometimes, we have issues. Older kids walking along the back fences casing the houses (our two large dogs make sure they know ours is off limits! not like people aren't terrified of the ducks anyways. Who knew?). We have adults drinking and breaking glass bottles on the kids' PLAYGROUND, and once we had needles. Plus the occasional used condom. This is not cool at all.   \n\n\nFor those lovely people, we have a green laser pointer that my husband purchased for this very reason. Really hard to see where it is coming from, not dangerously or illegally bright, but when it's shining on someone's dashboard at ass-o-clock in the morning and they are up to no good? It's more than enough to spook them and get them out of the lot pronto.   \n\n\nUsually takes less than a minute for them to notice and get freaked and get the heck out of dodge. I don't think we've ever seen a vehicle come back a second time.",

When people ask me what I am looking at I use the pointer and tell them to follow the green light.  Mine will be visible for about 10,000 meters.  Not sure what you have that does not show where it is originating, mine sure does.",

Ours is nowhere near strong enough to go 10,000 meters. 100 feet would really be pushing it.  So, no, it's not clearly visible until it lights up the dash :D",

[Cheap laser pointers are often well over safe power levels even if the label says otherwise](https://www.laserpointersafety.com/news/news/other-news_files/9b8ab12ef4a677303352e398cd6e1b28-506.php). And cheap DPSS green lasers sometimes lack an IR filter, which means they can be putting out dangerous levels of invisible infra-red light even it doesn't look that bright.\n\nIt's really not a good idea to point lasers at people or vehicles.",

A lot of cheap electronics are made in China where they don't really care, they just label the product as &lt;5mw whether or not it actually is, and nobody is checking to see if these cheap imported lasers comply with the rules. There's a number of [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH3yMeA7HxQ) where people test these and they often turn out to be more than 10 times the legal limit.\n\nOf course, anything that is being sold as a laser pointer, pet toy, or similar ought not to be powerful enough to be dangerous, and legally they shouldn't be, but they often are.\n\n&gt; If you pointed it at a plane you'd see absolutely nothing because there's no way the beam would make it that far.\n\nEven a 1mw laser can be visible from several kilometers away in clear air. The beam doesn't stop it just spreads out. Planes are generally going to be far enough away that even a high powered handheld laser is unlikely to be an eye hazard for the pilot - the bigger risk is that it will distract them and make it difficult to see what they're doing. In many countries it's illegal to point a laser at an aircraft regardless of the power of the laser.",

    "postText": "I was renting a room from some elderly lady. The room was cheap, but didn't have any lock on the bedroom door. I mean she was older lady (70+) and I never thought that this is some sort of a problem for me. \n\nOne day when I came back home she was waiting for me. She accused me of stealing her clothes. I was not sure what she meant by that. I was a 25 year old girl back then and her clothes were absolutely not my style. \n\nApparently she went into my room when I was not there and searched the drawers and she found her socks. Probably mixed in the laundry. I have unhealthy habit of never pairing my socks and just throwing them in the drawer and wear socks that are mismatched.\n\nI was super angry about that. I told her that she can't go in my room and look through my drawers. She basically said that it's her house and she can do whatever she wants. And then proceeded to scream at me for having too much underwear. I did have a lot, but that was my problem. \n\nI was not really able to move out since her house was close to my work and cheap so I was able to save up a lot of money every month. But I wanted my privacy. So I came up with a plan.\n\nOn my day off I went to a sex shop and I bought some toys. Not super expensive ones, but few things that were kinky enough. I also bought few packs of condoms. When I came back I put the toys in the drawers so they were the first thing that you would see. I also opened the condoms and added some milk and shaving cream to it.so they looked used. I placed them everywhere. \n\nTwo days later I am back home from work and there is a guy putting a lock on my bedroom door. Never.had any.problems after that stunt and the lady was avoiding me like a plague.",

I had a terrible roommate, who was terrible for a lot of reasons... but the relevant one in this case is that he would routinely forget to flush after using the toilet, and it was always absolutely vile.\n\nSo one day when he was in class, I went into action. Had some hot cocoa mix in the room and proceeded to add a few scoops into the toilet. Had some powedered iced tea too and poured some of that in there too. Made sure to throw in a few toilet paper squares too. And for the grand finale, wet some toilet paper, put a little cocoa on it, and a little dab of ketchup, and wipe it on the back of the rim of the seat.\n\nHe came back from class, ran to the bathroom, opened the lid, and started gagging. Started yelling at me about how gross and unacceptable this was. I waited until he stopped yelling and pointed out that he left the bathroom like that all the time. The difference was that mine was faked. I showed him my supplies.\n\nAnd then, he remembered to flush. For like... maybe a few weeks before going back to his old ways.",

Paranoia and rage doesn't just set in when the person is unable to take care of themself. They can be perfectly calm and rational one day, only to suffer from heavy mood swings and delusions the next.\n\n&gt; It's very common for elderly people who are self-sufficient to showcase paranoia and anger as part of dementia. Suspicions of thieving neighbors and family members are good examples, where the elderly person might angrily accuse a child or grandchild of having stolen clothing items, keys and whatnot.\n\n&gt; These kinds of behavioral changes are among the kinds of incidents that raise flags with family members to begin with.\n\nIt's definitely possible to both be lucid enough to do daily tasks and behave outrageously due to dementia.\n\n&gt; Being fucked in the head is not an excuse for being a piece of shit.\n\nThen you don't know anything about mental issues, because mental issues can make people do things that they have little agency over.",

It's an invasion of privacy and an infringement on their personal security. However, if the transgressions are caused by mental issues then it makes no sense to try to hold the person accountable for their actions given that they'd be cognitively impaired and therefore physiologically unable to moderate their behavior.\n\nIt's extremely problematic that an adult person's immediate response to an elderly person showcasing these behaviors is to concoct a convoluted trap instead of considering that there might be other factors at play.\n\nParanoia, accusing people of petty theft, unprovoked aggression and irrational rationalizations should be treated as warning signs in elderly people, not as an excuse to rub one's hands together and start devising a revenge plan.\n\nAnd honestly, the way that OP has couch-diagnosed the woman as \"without dementia\" and diagnosed myself as a \"delusional narcissist\" because they \"know more about dementia than you can imagine\" while doubling-down on their behavior towards the elderly woman without showing even a hint of willingness towards retrospection makes them seem unempathic, catty and self-absorbed.",

People can showcase any or all of the common behavioral symptoms that are associated with dementia at any point of the disease's progression. Paranoia and rage doesn't just set in when the person is unable to take care of themself. They can be perfectly calm and rational one day, only to suffer from heavy mood swings and delusions the next.\n\nIt's very common for elderly people who are self-sufficient to showcase paranoia and anger as part of dementia. Suspicions of thieving neighbors and family members are good examples, where the elderly person might angrily accuse a child or grandchild of having stolen clothing items, keys and whatnot.\n\nThese kinds of behavioral changes are among the kinds of incidents that raise flags with family members to begin with.\n\n&gt; You see someone who is old and you think that they have dementia because they act in a weird way. The only person who could comment what you commented and have the right to a diagnosis is her doctor or a family member.\n\nNo, because I'm not saying that she definitely has dementia. I'm saying that her behaviors are indicative of dementia, which is a good reason to avoid messing with her.\n\n&gt; And since I am probably more qualified to give diagnosis on this matter then you should just move on right now. I am actually writing a doctorate on dementia right now. I diagnosed more people than you (not strangers from the internet, obviously). I am not alpha and omega, but I am qualified enough to say that she didn't have a dementia.\n\nExcept you aren't qualified to say that she doesn't have dementia, and if you had any respect for the diagnostic process you wouldn't struggle so much with acknowledging that.",

She was being nosy and u pulled a prank on her, not like u were purposely trying to harm her or she was suffering from severe paranoia and confusion which resulted in aggression on her part. Alzheimer\u2019s isn\u2019t the same as dementia either. It definitely did not need to go as far as this person has gone. Forgetting things and confusion are the first signs, being defensive because they\u2019re feeling vulnerable is completely different from paranoia and aggression\u2026.but there\u2019s always an armchair pro that\u2019ll make it their mission to inform everyone of how wrong they are because they don\u2019t see it the same was a they do. I think ur experience was hilarious!",

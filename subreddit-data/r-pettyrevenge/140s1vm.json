    "postText": "I am a 33F, single. An old guy (75m) who shared a room with my dad in the nursing home always made me feel super uncomfortable. He would look at me sexually and asked me for my number several times. (He does not have dementia, he\u2019s just a disgusting old creep that does this to every young female). My dad was discharged yesterday and when we were leaving, I decided to \u201cstick it to him.\u201d I went over to him and asked if would like my number. He said \u201csure!\u201d excitedly. \n\nSo I wrote down my old number, knowing it had been disconnected and misspelled my name so he couldn\u2019t look for me when I left. Felt so good to see the look on his disgusting face when he got it, because I can only imagine the disappointment he will get when he tries to call it. Mwahahahaha!",

I told him because he was following me around, wouldn\u2019t take NO for an answer, and to leave me the fuck alone.  \n\nHe genuinely thought that because I was reasonably polite to him earlier that somehow I was interested in him.  NO, I WAS NOT.  I just wanted to do my work and GRFO of the lab and away from him.  (Other semesters I could just dial into the machines but these lab machines had UI interfaces that could not be exported.)\n\nAfter that he talked about me behind my back and called me a bitch but oh well.  I also learned he did the same thing to several other female students.  I suppose if all four of us had complained something would have been done, but we really did not need to become \u201cfamous\u201d over shit like that.\n\nSome people are so incapable of taking NO for an answer it\u2019s like they live in their own little worlds where NO means \u201cI bet if I pester her enough she\u2019ll fall in love with me!\u201d",

This could  be because they moved to a new city, want to prevent specific people  from reaching them, or just feel like changing things up. Whatever the  reason may be, they are no longer reachable at this phone number.\n\nWhat is phone number recycling?\n\nPhone number recycling is the industry term that refers to the event  when that deactivated/disconnected number gets reassigned to someone  else. Typically, it takes at least 90 days for this reassignment to take  place but it can be faster in high-demand area codes (212, 310, etc.).",

I know I'm not special, far from it. As for getting off my high horse and having empathy for people, that's something OP should take into consideration. Pertaining to this post, I have empathy! Something OP fails to mention is that the man had his phone privilege taken away. Her father was no longer going to be there and took it upon herself to give the man a number. She should've just left, but nope, walked up to him and gave a 75 year old man in a care home a phone number. She has also spoke of how Christian she is but yet calls him physically ugly and he's a creepy old man and deserves what she did. That's not Christian. And having her mom move in to help her and then ask for advice in how to kick her out. The lady gave birth to her, she's in her 70's, then come on Reddit complaining. To say she cares about old people but posts things like that... posts and comments speak volumes.",

I am offensive because you don\u2019t know everything I dealt with and you keep giving your rebuttal as if you do. I just wanted to give this guy one taste of karma. I didn\u2019t hit him. I didn\u2019t curse him out. I gave him a disconnected number. He does deserve what I did. You don\u2019t know what a monster he was to the nurses, me, and my dad when he was there.\n\nEdit: BTW, I wasn\u2019t being \u201cchildish.\u201d I was being petty.

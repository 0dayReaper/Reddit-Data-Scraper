    "postText": "Short and sweet this one. Got a neighbour across the road. She sits on the benefit all day smoking and doing her gardens; when she's not doing that she sits at the window (smoking) and staring out at our house which is directly opposite. She's a bit batty and a lonely old soul so we tolerate her and help her out from time to time. She has made the occasional comment about our lawns, gardens etc. My wife works full time and has her own side business and I also run my own business. We also live in an area where the grass grows like a MOFO. She sent my wife a message the other day saying there were some young guys there who could help with our lawns. My wife blew her off and sent me the screenshot. They were on the cusp of needing doing and I was actually planning on going out to do them that afternoon, but her comment pissed me off, we do our best with the time we have. So I didn't go out to do them and it rained for 2 weeks solid so they continued to get messier, no doubt spoiling her view. Finally got them cut today which backfired a bit as they were a real bitch to mow, but so worth it.  \n\n\nTLDR: Neighbour made a comment about our lawns so I didn't mow them when I was going to",

I don't want my dogs getting fleas so I get mad that my neighbor mows her lawn about 5 times a year and complains that her dog has fleas while it stands at the fence trying to interact with my dogs. Just keep the fleas and ticks and mosquitoes under control and I don't care what your lawn looks like.",

You have to let the grass dry out before cutting, even with a petrol mower, you destroy thegrass &amp; the mower. Cutting wet grass shreds the grass, meaning it will not grow properly. Look at a farmers field he wants dry grass to cut.",

He smiles ear to ear and says, \u201cUh\u2026 It\u2019s out of order.\u201d There are two unisex bathroom doors btw. I ask him, \u201cAh man, I really, really have to go. Where do you go? Across the street?\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know, dude, just use a tree or some shit.\u201d I go back to my car piss in a big jug. Filled it up good, like two minutes of pissing. I hop out my car, look him in the eyes from the window and poor it all out in the trashcan they have at the front of the store. \n\nDon\u2019t deny people the ability to piss.",

My dear Mother was VERY particular about a spotless and clean bathroom!  I can't convey just how much I appreciated that after walking into other people's houses or public bathrooms that weren't very clean. \n\nWhen I first started dating my husband, he lived with two Male roommates (buddies from high school).  The first time I visited the house, I was HORRIFIED by the state of their bathroom (and kitchen).  I had to go BUY cleaning supplies because they were living like cavemen and it took me THREE hours to clean the bathroom.  I don't think they had EVER cleaned the room since moving in.  I was simply ASTONISHED how far up the wall the urine stains were.  My first question to all of them was \"WHO potty-trained them?\"\n\nWhile I'm NOT a germaphobe, I just can't stand a dirty bathroom.  But, for at least the last decade, I've been even MORE grossed out by women not disposing of their \"sanitary products\" properly!  THAT'S even more grotesque!",

So one time we didn't know where it was, and a little kid came and asked me for it. I told him it was lost. A few minutes later a woman comes and asks, and I look down to see if the kid was with her, (he wasn't standing there but I think he was standing with her husband) and then looked back at her and told her we didn't know where it was. This woman proceeded to flip out on me, yelling and cussing at me, I had a line full of people I was trying to ring up and I made min wage. When my boss showed up the woman told her I \"looked her up and down like she was (scum, garbage, idr the word she used)\" and that I was rude and she knew we knew where the key was etc. Me looking her \"up and down\" was when I was looking for the kid lol. Anyway my boss told her the same thing I did, that we didn't know where the key was, then made her leave for yelling and cussing at me and making a scene",

Right about that time, our washrooms were out of order, and the company had to rent out portable toilets (the kind on little trailers that at least had a sink and stuff, thankfully not porta-potties).  Our washrooms were out of order for a few months.\n\nDo you know *why* they were out of order?  Some thief (and we got a *lot* of thieves) decided that upon entering the washroom with stolen goods, it didn't make sense to ditch the packaging in the garbage.  Oh no.  It made *much* more sense to try to cram it down a toilet that could in no way handle it.  Apparently, somewhere in the system was a pump to handle the large volumes of crap the system dealt with, and this pump was damaged by the thieving asshole.  It took a long time to get whatever replacement parts were needed, all because some asshole thought breaking the toilets, inconveniencing countless people, and costing tens of thousands of dollars of damage would be *funny*.\n\nAs another example, there's a 24-hour Subway (the sandwich chain, not mass transit) near my place, and I'd often stop there on my way home at night.  One night, I'm getting my sub, and I see this really sketchy looking couple come in, and bitch about the 'out of order' sign on the door (keep in mind it's about 1am at this point).  After they leave, I asked the girl behind the counter if it was *really* out of order, and she said it wasn't.  I don't blame her; it looked like they only wanted to use the washroom to get high.\n\nIt's entirely possible that the toilets *were* broken.  Alternatively, maybe this employee was tired of dealing with cleaning up other people's shit, piss, and/or drug paraphernalia.  Maybe they'd had some asshole come in and stop up the sink with paper towels and leave the water running, so that if they overdosed, the flood would prompt someone to come shoot them full of naloxone before they died- because, you know, some dickhead's choice to abuse drugs is somehow *everyone else's* problem.\n\nThe fact that you acted like a petulant child (and a fucking dirty and disgusting one at that) when you didn't get your way tells me that the employee was right in not allowing you the washroom.",

Speaking from experience, when you're working by yourself at a gas station, you're more concerned about if you're going to be hit with a beer run or held up than someone who demands to use a restroom as if yours is the only one in the city. I quit working at a gas station because they continued to allow things to happen that put my safety at risk.",

I'm sure there were other stores, etc, along the way.\n\nI don't like using public washrooms at the best of times, and would routinely hold it for five to eight hours or more.  The idea that OP couldn't have gone five minutes later (or even five minutes earlier) is pretty ludicrous.\n\n&gt; Also, Ive had 3 kids and my bladder has less than zero time from the moment I feel I have to go and the moment I NEED to find a bathroom. \n\nPiss yourself a lot, then, do you?\n\nIf you have 'less than zero' time between the urge and the act, that means that by the time you know you need to urinate, you've already done it.  So, unless you're saying you piss yourself on the regular, I call bullshit.\n\n&gt; Who\u2019s to say there aren\u2019t medical issues involved? \n\nNobody, but I know if I had some medical issue (like Crohn's disease or something) that made my need that much more urgent, I'd say something of the sort to the employee.  Embarrassing?  Maybe, but it's a lot less embarrassing than shitting one's pants.\n\n&gt; Gotta do better than that if you are gonna be all judgy\n\nOh, look at you, being all judgy when the washrooms could very well have been out of service.\n\nPot, meet kettle.",

Even if they did, this would mean having an employee escort OP to the washroom in question (because such a washroom would be in an area normally off-limits to the public), which would probably compromise both security and safety, since it's safe to say there was only one employee on shift (gas station, remember; this is standard practice).\n\nWhere I live, employers (with limited exceptions) must provide washrooms to their *employees*, but are under no obligation to provide them to *customers* in most cases.  Dine-in restaurants need to provide washrooms, but something like a gas station does not.\n\nRemember that many businesses offer this as a *privilege*, not a *right*.  Abuse of this privilege can cause it to be taken away, and as with many other things, all it takes is a few assholes to ruin it for the rest of us.",

    "postText": "My grade 12 calculus teacher was a bit on the sarcastic side and I was (and still am) a bit of a smartass jerk. We got along well.\n\nOne day\u2026\n\nMr. C: _We\u2019re ahead of the other calculus classes by two or three days. (brief pause) It must be because you\u2019re such **brilliant** students._\n\nMe: _Well, it can\u2019t be because of the teacher!_\n\nCue classroom laughter and what today we call a shocked Pikachu face from Mr. C.\n\nA week or so later, a question on our next test:\n\n_TDLMTH is hurled off a building 200m tall. At the same instant, a flower pot is pushed off a ledge 100m up. At what initial velocity must TDLMTH be hurled off the top so that he and the flower pot soil the pavement at the same time?_\n\nWell played, Mr. C. Well played.",

            "comment": "At one point in my military career, I taught United States Air Force troops how to compute travel vouchers. They had a workbook with samples to study the night before, but I knew it would be nonsensical for some folks until I started explaining, step-by-step with an example on the chalk (later dry erase) board. I did **not** write the same samples from the book onto the board.\n\nMy first sample is LtCol Addams who is being transferred from base X to base Y. He is accompanied by his wife of 18 years, Morticia. Daughter Wednesday (15) and Son Pugsley (11) as well as brother Fester. Smiles start breaking out and looks of \"This could be fun\" appeared.\n\nI also used the sample to *teach*. Entitlements were different for children by age, and Uncle Fester had no monetary compensation, since he wasn't a legal dependent of LTC Addams. It's hard to have fun with accounting, but I tried.",

He was stingy with credit for small things (e.g., \"should of\" instead of \"should have\" would get the entire answer marked wrong). It was a small town and one night he was pulled over for driving erratically. This was almost 50 years ago. Today there would be a breathalyzer and arrest, but back then the Deputy (who knew him personally) simply followed him home to make sure he got there safely. But the Deputy told his wife, and it being a small town she told a few of her friends, and a classmate heard it from his mom, and his class then knew.\n\nThe yearbook advisor did not know about this. Back then you wrote a quote for your senior picture in the yearbook, and about 20 of us referenced something he told us in class. The yearbook advisor didn't tell him, because she thought it would be a nice surprise when the yearbook came out. \n\nI still remember the day when he told us that \"alcohol is a solution\". It was soon after the incident, and we all wrote it down in our Chemistry notebook, grinning. The quote in the yearbook was (word for word from each of us) \"Alcohol is a solution - Mr. Kirkpatrick\". \n\nHe refused to sign our yearbooks.",

In my country the amount of money that you are fined for speeding depends on the speed you are going. One time there were roadworks in the area where these teachers lived, the maths teacher was very conscious about it when driving, the biology teacher was not and he racked up quite a few fines for speeding. Needless to say we had a very extensive question on our next maths test on calculating speeding fines that \"Mr. Sailor\" should get. We had biology the hour after that test, which Mrs Tailor knew about. Let's just say that there were a lot of questions in biology that day that had little to do with the human skeleton.",

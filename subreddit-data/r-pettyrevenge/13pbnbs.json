    "postText": "I am a stay at home dad to my 19 month old daughter. We drive lots of places like parks, the Zoo, libraries, etc. We own a mid-sized SUV (Honda CRV) and I try to park in the middle of any space I\u2019m in.\n\nFor whatever reason some people love to park rightttttt up next to the line on one side or the other. While I totally understand people trying to avoid others parked over the lines, or that one person parks poorly, the next person has to go over the line to avoid the first person, first person leaves and so second person looks dumb, etc., I don\u2019t get why people park so dang close if there\u2019s space. \n\nBut now when a car I know for SURE has parked too close so I can\u2019t get my kiddo in or out, I gently and discreetly fold in their car\u2019s mirror. I\u2019d never break anything and don\u2019t push too hard, just enough so that when they come out they have to adjust it.\n\nI\u2019ve done it maybe 3 times total in the past month, but I like being petty and making them have to unfold their mirror.",

My husband can, and apparently it's very normal to have a bunch of extra computers nowadays JUST so that things can't be fixed w/out paying a dealership to do it. And since dealerships don't treat mechanics well in general, they get part-swappers that know the bare minimum and hate their jobs. He does a LOT of repair work to fix what dealerships did (the latest one took the battery out of the car for starters) and most of the rest is the other small shops sending stuff to him because they can't fix it, like the programming issues and passwords to replace a computer and all sorts of amazing convoluted \"ha ha pay a dealer\" crap.",

This thing isn\u2019t that big by any standards (Renault grand Picasso) it\u2019s more long than wide but as parking spaces are so tight in the uk it\u2019s a nightmare. I always watch how I park and ensure im in the centre but it still doesnt leave much room but still a few inches either side before the line. If a car parks right on the line then often it means I can\u2019t park there if I want to open doors or I\u2019m Jammed between two cars. I\u2019ve given up getting my body work repaired because no matter how careful I am parking some asshole comes and THROWS their doors wide open to their full extent, full force and it always bounces off my car denting it. I never take two spaces or go near the lines but nothing I can do will ever stop people ruining and damaging my car. The thing is half the time they arrive in their cars after I\u2019ve parked and have left the car. So they choose where to park and just not even try to watch what they are doing. It\u2019s not even my mirrors as these automatically fold in when parked. Drives me mad. Went on holiday to America and it was great that you can actually fit all cars in the space and have room to open doors still. \n\nOp I don\u2019t blame you for folding the mirrors I just hate how careless everyone is and how they don\u2019t care about damaging other peoples cars.",

    "postText": "This story took place around a decade ago now, and just thought to share and hope you enjoy my lil petty action.\n\nI was working in fashion retail at the time and was responsible for the opening and closing of the store most of the time.\n\nAn assistant manager role was available and I applied for it, only to have the position filled by an external hire due to them having more managerial experience. I was relatively upset at the news since I had to teach her how to fill in the budget book, etc but didn't let it show.\n\nY'all.. this new assistant manager couldn't math for shit and I had to fix the budget book every time she had to close the shift prior. I'm bad at maths but simple addition, subtraction and multiplication?? I'm sure a kid can do better than that. Also found her peeling off her fake nails and just chucking them on the ground (I approached her on this and she shrugged saying I was going to vacuum anyways?!). Anyways, I digress.\n\nMy birthday is in September and it sucks whenever it came to asking for a day off as it falls on school holidays, aka busy season. I was happy to work on my birthday itself (on a Wednesdy iirc) and wanted to take the weekend off in advance.\n\nI asked my manager if I could have the Saturday I was scheduled on off, and she was like \"No, unfortunately it's going to be busy due to the school holidays and I need you in\". I asked if I could exchange it with the assistant manager who was working with her on Wednesday, and she outright denied it, giving some BS excuse. \n\nWell, by this point I was already frustrated at management, so I did the pettiest thing I could. \n\nI submitted my notice of resignation exactly 2 weeks prior to the Saturday I wanted off (on hindsight should have quit on the spot a day prior for ultimate pettiness). Hope either one of them enjoyed working that weekend! \ud83d\udc4d",

That's only because it was an overnight &amp; the store was closed.\n\nI remember one job where I requested my birthday off 6 weeks ahead of time. The owner told me that I would probably have to work. My birthday is not during any holiday.\n\nMy reply was she could schedule me to work on my birthday... But if she did, my last day would be the day before.\n\nI'm so glad she didn't test me on it.",

It was their choice, everyone was happy and it was good to have them there. They were mostly older nurses, in their fifties at least, and very experienced. One particular nurse, who had been working there for many years, was from Tonga. Every year she put in for annual leave over the Christmas period because she went home to visit her family in Tonga. \n\nThis one year I\u2019m thinking of, we had a new sister in charge of our ward. She was young and ambitious and trying a bit too hard to make her mark. Christmas was approaching and the nurse put in her application for leave. Sister in charge said she couldn\u2019t have it. Nurse applied again. Sister in charge said no again. This went on for weeks, with no resolution.\n\nEventually, just a couple of days before the nurse\u2019s desired commencement of leave, the sister in charge came up to her to set the record straight. She told the nurse once and for all that her leave will not be approved, so stop asking. \n\nThe nurse\u2019s reply still makes me laugh to this day. She said \u201cyou can roster me on, or not roster me, it doesn\u2019t really matter because I won\u2019t be here. I will be in Tonga.\u201d She smiled and walked away with dignity and self respect, leaving the young sister in charge gulping like a goldfish. It was beautiful to watch.\n\nThe nurse took her holiday and kept her job and the sister in charge stayed on for several more years as well. So I guess she found a replacement after all\u2026",

Specifically started on Fri-Sun but by the last semester I worked there it was just Sat/Sun. I got a new job on campus that was in my field of study. At this grocery store, you basically quit but putting in a time off request but not picking an end date. So I put what was to be my last day as December 3rd, a Saturday. Didnt work on Sunday since I was done as far as I knew and went on my merry way.\n\nThe following Thursday, I was waiting to get a haircut coincidentally next door to the store when my phone rang. I didnt recognize the number but had an instant suspicion. Since I was checked in I went ahead and walked next door and sure enough apparently I had been scheduled for that day. Apparently they mistook my '3' for an '8'. Nevermind the fact I had never worked on a Thursday in the 2.5 years Id worked there. Nothing they could do, so I went back to get the haircut.\n\nThe epilogue is that I went back to the store after the haircut to get some basic groceries. As I was checking out, the cashier asked me if I was scheduled for that day. I told them how apparently they thought Id made myself available for this one last day even though I was done. The cashier responded in a not super happy mood, \"Yeah, Im the one covering the shift.\" Like sorry my guy, but not my problem management made a mistake.",

After the third outage in the first week of his management, the supervisor basically had to make running that department her main job, even moving her office to that part of the building. There was so much to do that she never did find enough time to properly train him, so for me the rest of that summer was spent pretty much phoning it in, and enjoying the train wreck.\n\nIt got so bad that I started carrying a pink highlighter in addition to my normal pens while pulling orders from the warehouse, to flag all the shit that was being ordered that we were out of. Normally they happened maybe once or twice a *month*, but within a week or two after all this happened, it was 3 or 4 per day.",

Sometimes it would be every other Saturday for a couple of months. \n\nIt turned out in October of one year we had to work every other Saturday. Well my birthday, on a Saturday was on one of the off weekends. I was very happy until Thursday before the weekend, management decided to make Saturday mandatory. \n\nI asked for it off. No can do. I should have requested a vacation day two weeks ago. I pointed out that two weeks previously, it was not a work day, so how could I ask for it off? Then I told them it was my birthday too so I wasn\u2019t going to work. Too bad, they said.\n\nNormally I rolled over and just did what was asked. Not this time. I said, well I guess I\u2019m going to be sick then. Supervisor said we will put you down as an unapproved absence and would get my pay docked. \n\nBy that time I was steaming mad and told them again, Birthday \ud83c\udf82, wasn\u2019t supposed to be a workday, and I wasn\u2019t coming in. Dock my pay, unapproved absence, whatever. Maybe quit. \n\nAll of a sudden I got approved and had a very happy birthday.",

I'll continue to do the bare minimum, but don't expect any advances in my efficiency, or for me to accept new challenges, stay late, fill in for anyone, or start early or stay late to meet project deadlines.

But you handled that just fine, and good on you for seeing your boundaries.\n\nI've got three analysts working for me (IT), and they're slowly learning that I'm encouraging them to set those boundaries. I've yet to decline a day off, even with just a few hours notice. \n\nTwo of them come from some pretty toxic places (call center and retail), so they still get taken off balance when I *don't* give them shit for asking for time off.\n\nThere are good places to work. Find them. The rest of those assholes will either have to grow up and learn, or go out of business.",

I do have to thank this experience for making me a better manager now (or at least I hope I am) - life can chuck shit at us out of nowhere, so I can empathise the need to have a day off to sort it out, especially if said employee has a good track record of attendance, requested time-off months in advance, etc. \n\nI am a huge advocate for taking a mental health day when needed. You have one life, and it shouldn't be wholly focused on work unless you really really really enjoy it (that in itself is rare AF). Another thing I advocate for is turning work shit OFF when you're not on shift.",

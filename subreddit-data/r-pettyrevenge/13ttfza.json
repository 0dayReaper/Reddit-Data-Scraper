    "postText": "Well over a decade ago, we had grade A, shit head landlord. We lived in a large old Victorian house that was converted into about 4-5 individual apartments. The landlord had installed the HVAC system himself. He had no idea what he was doing and did it wrong. \n\nIt was a forced air natural gas system. His incompetence caused the exhaust pipe to melt/burn away, releasing the CO in the building. We called the Fire Department who shut it off and Red-Tagged the machine. It was cold in mid January. A half day goes by with no response from the land lord things were chilly. Finally, we called an HVAC company to do the repair, at that time, about $650. \n\nLandlord calls back about 2 days later and flips out that we called the FD and a contractor. He refuses to reimburse us for the repair. \n\nHe bemoans us he could have handled the issue.\n\nPeople like this aren't worth reasoning with or wasting time escrowing the rent in court. \n\nRevenge:\n\nThere was coin operated laundry in the basement. It was about \\~$4 to do a load of laundry. My buddy and I got a case of beer and took apart the entire coin-op hardware and rigged up some zip ties out the back of the machines so we could trigger the mechanical switch and do all the free laundry we wanted. \n\nAll the tenants were updated on the laundry bypass and his actions being an absolute asshole. They were happy to save on free laundry. With 5 units doing about 3-4 loads per week. I'm thinking he lost about $60-100/week.\n\nThat cock sucker would come to empty the coins and bitched that no one was using his laundry machines. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: Landlord refused to reimburse us for emergency repairs. We modified his coin op laundry to do free laundry and get our money back.**",

He did shitty HVAC work that caused the accumulation of CO and did nothing about it but berate you all for getting it fixed. Nevermind that he was unreachable for 2 days. Fuck that guy.

Don't be afraid to exercise your legal rights. small claims doesn't require lawyers, and if you do need one many will take legitimate cases pro-Bono. \n\n  I had a landlord who ignored complaints about the squirrel cage on top of the chimney being off. All four water heaters and the boiler system routed up the chimney.  He ended up replacing one of the boilers and routed the new one also up the chimney (against code at the time). Sure enough a squirrel built a nest in the chimney blocking it. Shortly after the boiler install we began to complain about the exhaust in the house, his solution... Open a window.  Mind you it was late fall and nights were dropping into the single digit Fahrenheit. Every year at this time he'd take a month or two long vacation.  That year didn't leave any means of contact, and later found out he'd left his pager at home. And he was scheduled to be back in 9 weeks. This vacation was a combined marriage / honeymoon, to with his 4th wife a mail in bride. The day he left the second (older boiler) failed and a few week later one of the water heaters flooded the basement. Three weeks into his vacation with no response and it was obvious the house was unlivable. \n\nGod bless my boss at the time, a wonderful man with many contacts who got us all out of there. Even paying for a hotel and movers for us while he found us better places. Now, my boss was a lawyer, an old school type that drew up contracts on a napkin while telling jokes and drinking scotch. And believed that a deal was as strong as the handshake behind it.  Lord have mercy on the person who drew his ire, even the devil wouldn't tangle with him when he was pissed.  Let me tell you, he was beyond pissed. got the city to condemn the building.  Then he property searched the landlord and had every building inspected (12 rentals).  Half of which ended up being condemned, the rest weren't far behind. The thing about old school lawyers, they know the old school judges, and the old school prosecutors, and the old school police. They will absolutely dismantle your life and screw you without lube. They assigned officers to monitor the landlords car at the airport.  On the day he returned he was arrested (his wife too for assault on a police officer). Boss ended up suing landlord on our behalf including repayment for his expenses and the maximums allowed by the law. Judge ended up awarding us even more, every single of his tenants ended up with about 6 months of our rent back. The cherry on top... landlords wife promptly divorced him with help from my bosses sister in law, a divorce attorney. Landlord was forced to sell almost everything, spent some time in jail, eventually returned to jail on a dui with suspended license, suffered a fatal heart attack before his sentencing for that charge.",

Yes, he lost money on the laundry, but not only could you have got your rent back, you could have sued him for  criminal negligence, costing him a lot of money in court fees alone, never mind the money he'd have had to pay out when he lost.",

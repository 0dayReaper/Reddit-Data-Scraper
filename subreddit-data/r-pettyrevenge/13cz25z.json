    "postText": "This got longer than expected so TLDR at the bottom.\n\nMany moons ago I worked in construction, repairs after water and fire damage specifically.  It was my fathers company and I worked there between studies and other jobs, but I got fairly decent at the job in time, at least good enough to be trusted with managing the on-site duties for smaller jobs. We typically handle everything on the job site, including hiring third party painters, plumbers and electricians, as the jobs we took were insurance jobs.\n\nThe customer was home as I was finishing up putting down new floorboards and molding after a water leak in their kitchen due to cracked plumbing, asking questions about the job and otherwise being pleasant to be around. As I was packing down my gear the plumber we contracted arrives. I was pleasantly surprised to see that \"Helen\" was the one showing up. Having worked with her before we have a quick chat as she is grabbing what she needs from her truck. \"Helen\" was in her early twenties at this time, with a year or two on the job but is constantly praised behind her back by her coworkers for her exceptional work.\n\nI walk back into the house with her and show her the kitchen and she gets ready to do her work. I enter the living room with my broom and vacuum to clean up after myself and inform the tenant that the plumber is here and his kitchen will be fully functional once she is done.\n\n\"She? Women cant be plumbers\" he says as lets out a annoying sounding grunt. I assure him it is a she, and that she knows her stuff. He looks quizzically at me and moves to the kitchen to, I assume, confirm that is was in fact a woman. I loosely follow as I sense a situation brewing and because I am curious.\n\nIn the kitchen he lets out a disappointed \"hello?\" and after she introduces herself he asks where the \"real\" plumber is. She informs him that she is the plumber and that she will be done shortly. He refuses to believe that she is the actual plumber and asks again where the \"real\" plumber is. She gets a confused look at her face and before she has time to respond he utters \"I want a real plumber, not a little girl who cried her way to this job and will screw it up because a cute little girl like you cannot be a plumber\". She is rightfully angered by this, does not know how to respond. I step in to tell him she really is a plumber and is more than capable for a simple job like this. He still refuses to believe this and tells her to call a real plumber and orders her out of the house. She gets up and heads over to her car with tears in her eyes. I asked if she was ok, she said yes but I doubt that was true. She told me to finish up what I was doing while she called her boss. I figured she wanted to be alone a few minutes and obliged.\n\nHer boss, hearing what had happened instructed her to stay there while he came over to talk to this fine specimen of humanity. I was done with my tasks at the house and stayed to talk with her while we waited for her boss.\n\nWhen her boss came, we gave him the full story and watched him go over to the house. Their interaction took place at the front door, next to where we were parked. The owner of the house spat out \"Finally, someone who knows their stuff, right this way\" and turned around to show the location of the kitchen. Her boss just said \"No\", making the owner turn back. \"Just because she is a young woman does not mean she is not a great plumber, she is one of my best. You do not talk to any of my employees like that. We will not finish this job\".\n\nAfter that he walked back over to us and just said \"Let's go\". We all left.\n\nAs our company was project lead, we would have been the ones finding a different plumber to take the job, however my dad does not care for these kinds of disrespectful people. Once I told him about that days events, he contacted the insurance company and informed them that the customer was disrespectful to his employees and subcontractors and would no longer offer services to this customer.\n\nWe still had some carpentry work left at this mans house waiting for the electrician to finish his work which also was canceled as they were subcontracted by us and paid by us.\n\nThis meant that the insurance company had to contract a new company for project lead, which then had to contact their own subcontractors. The magnificent timing of these events meant that no one had open slots in their calendars for this job.\n\nWe have a good relationship with the insurance agents we work with, and was informed that it took a full week before this job was completed, instead of being finished the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonus**\n\nAbout a year later we are talking to the insurance agent on a different job, and he asks if we remember this customer. He informs us that he had a new water leak in a different section of the house. It was discovered that the plumbing work was done by one of the customers friends. In Norway plumbing (and electrical) needs to be done and documented by a licensed professional, otherwise your insurance will not be paid. As you might have guessed, his friend is not a plumber.\n\nHe had to pay the repairs of the latest damages out of pocket, and the insurance company took a new look at the first leak. It was decided that the initial water leak also did not qualify for insurance, and he had to pay back the full amount of repairs for this as well.\n\nI gave \"Helen\" a call with the fantastic news, and she was ecstatic. \n\n**TLDR;**\n\nBigoted man is refused plumbing services when he does not accept a female plumber, and has to wait another week to have his house repaired after water damages.",

The only one that could fit fully (and still work) in the hole was this skinny 16 yo girl, and she fixed more than any of the buff menfolk did just because she could get at it. Tho it was amusing to see someone hanging face down in a hole of sewer while trying to reach a certain pipe.. \n\nWe asked the plumber to hire her permanently and to bring her when we called. \n\nHe obliged and as far as I know she still works there.",

Because I know now if she needed to do an oil change by God she can do it. \n\nQuickest way to make me mad was \"can't do this task because I'm a woman.\" In the trade skills and industrial arts.

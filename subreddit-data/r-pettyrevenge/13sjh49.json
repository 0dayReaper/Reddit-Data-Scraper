    "postText": "Firstly, on mobile, so sorry in advanced for formatting or spelling or etc., and it\u2019s a revenge I was happy to witness\n\nSo a little bit of background, there is a humane society shelter near where I live, and I and my friends go there on weekends to see the cats and help socialize them. During this visit, they were introducing a new litter of puppies that were ready to be adopted (this will be relevant later).\nLet me set the scene: the volunteers are behind the desk, a couple looking to adopt is sitting and playing with the puppies, and I\u2019m by one of the cats saying my hellos. \n\nI\u2019m not sure when she came in, but I noticed when she raised her voice; a wild Karen had come in claiming that one of the dogs the shelter had was hers, a sweet pit bull terrier named Toffee. The volunteers and shelter owner went through the usual procedure, asking her breed, age, color (things that could all be seen on their website) which the Karen answered with increasing agitation.\n\nThen they asked if she had been spayed, microchipped, etc., all to which the Karen answered \u2018yes\u2019. However, they revealed that Toffee had come to them six months ago, no microchip, and pregnant (the puppies out that day weren\u2019t hers but I digress).\n\nThe Karen stutters, and at this point everyone can tell she\u2019s trying to just take a dog for free. At this moment, Toffee comes out from the kennels since they had to bring her out. The woman sees this and calls to her, calling \u201cToffee! Come here Toffee!\u201d, which is the name the shelter gave her, not any other name that the dog might recognize. What\u2019s better, Toffee completely ignores the woman and instead goes over to the couple, far more interested in the puppy in the wife\u2019s arms.\n\nAt this point Karen became aggressive, trying to grab the leash from the volunteer and cursing at the staff behind the desk. The owner tells her they won\u2019t be giving her the dog, since she got the health information wrong, the dog did not recognize her, and that Toffee has been with them for six months and she was even on the news trying to get people to claim her (typically a lost dog is picked up within a week, the shelter is very good about this). The owner tells her to leave, and Karen huffs and stomps, saying she\u2019s got pictures and proof and all that. When asked to show this, instead of pulling out her phone or wallet or anything, she leaves the building, getting into her car and driving off. \n\nEveryone kinda laughed at the situation, and the owner stated no one could see Toffee without her present. At this time, the wife placed the puppy she had been holding (looked like a Labrador mix, cute little golden baby) and suddenly Toffee starts huffing, something she hadn\u2019t done before. The volunteer shushes her, but the wife says \u201coh, did I take away your friend? I\u2019m sorry\u201d and brings the puppy back out, which calms Toffee down.\n\nThe husband then picks up some treats and gets Toffee to follow a few commands (sit, shake, etc), which she does with a smile. The couple shared a look and, to my absolute delight, ask about adopting both the puppy and Toffee. At this point, the shelter was closing and me and my friend were ready to leave, but I did see them with the applications on the table and pens in hand.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if they adopted her with revenge in mind, but it was both heartwarming and hilarious to see Toffee so happy and know that the Karen would not be stealing her away. \n\nIf it matters (and because it\u2019s cute) I think the couple were thinking of naming the puppy \u201cbutterscotch\u201d.",

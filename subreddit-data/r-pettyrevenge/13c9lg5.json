    "postText": "When I was in college, I had this ex that I had a bad break up with. After a few months of not seeing each other, we met up to exchange our things, and I thought we were fine from how our conversation went. I later realized they hadn\u2019t given me back all of my stuff, and called them asking for it back. They refused and eventually ended up blocking my number. I would\u2019ve honestly not cared about it bc at that point I wanted it all to be over, but I couldn\u2019t let it go because they stole some jewelry that were gifted to me from family. Over time I tried to forget about it and kept telling myself there was nothing I could do.\n\nA few months later I was walking back to my dorm, and saw their car was parked in a handicap spot. I literally ran to my room, called campus police, told them someone had parked in a handicap spot, and gave them the car description. They let me know they would send someone at some point (esp bc universities loveeee nothing more than giving out tickets). I could see the parking lot from my room and few hours later saw someone pull up to the car and put a ticket on it. I woke up the next day, saw the ticket on the door, but the car was still there\u2026so I called again. Felt kind of bad about it, but also helped me get out some of the frustration I had from them stealing my things :)",

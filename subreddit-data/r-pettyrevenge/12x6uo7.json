    "postText": "######TL;DR at the bottom.  \n.  \n######Disclaimers:  \n- Wasn't me.  I do not know who did it, but I was there to witness it.  It made me smile.  \n- U.S. Naval Aircraft Carrier standards may be different today, as well as other types of ships, but for tonight's story I'll tell it how it was for aircraft carriers back in the 90's.  \n- I classify this as petty.  Nobody was injured, other than some fuel paid for by the taxpayers.  \n.  \n\n######Definitions for those not familiar with U.S. Aircraft Carriers:  \n- **Float Coat:**  When working on the flightdeck of an aircraft carrier as maintainers (I.E. not flight crew) all personnel wore vests of various colors depending on your job.  If you fall overboard into the ocean, this vest inflates automatically when it comes into contact with salt water, and inflates as a life preserver (C02 cartridges set off) .  It also has a salt-water-activated strobe light, a whistle, and a manual tube to breath air into the vest.  \n- **12 on 12 off:**  When working onboard a carrier, there were 2 shifts.  Day shift 6am to 6pm, and night shift 6pm to 6am.  (mighta been 7 to 7, don't remember...something along those lines)  7 days a week.  \n- **General Quarters:**  When in battle, ALL personnel must go to their assigned battle stations and be ready for battle.  Leaders must take a head count and report that all personnel are accounted for.  \n- **Man Overboard:**  If someone falls into the ocean, ALL personnel have to muster with their leaders and be accounted for.  Leaders get a head count, see who's missing (ideally nobody), and report all accounted for.  \n- **Drills:**  We practice General Quarters and Man Overboard, so when the shit hits the fan, we're ready.  \n- **Squadron:**  A number of aircraft flown and maintained by the same group of Naval personnel.  A Squadron is normally assigned to a specific carrier, but can be shuffled as needed.  \n.  \n\n######On to the story  \n\nThe carrier set out for a 2 week training detachment with our Squadron and various other aircraft Squadrons onboard.  This was to train/qualify pilots for carrier operations.  I was a maintainer on night shift.  I worked 6pm to 6am, and slept from ~8am to 4pm or there abouts.  Everyone else on night shift did the same.  \n\nThe 2nd day onboard, there was a General Quarters Drill at ~11:00am...while night shift is dead asleep we all had to get out of bed and report to our battle stations.  3rd day Man Overboard Drill at 1:00pm...roll out of bed and muster.  4th day same shit 12:00pm.  5th day same shit. 6th day same shit.\n\nWe're starting to notice there's no Drills during night-shift while day-shift is sound asleep.  Could it be because the Captain and all the Officers work day shift?  Hm.  \n\nSo on the 6th night at 2:00am the alarm sounds for Man Overboard.  The entire boat, 5000+ personnel, have to muster for a head count.  The Choppers do a night launch for search and rescue.  They see a strobe light in the ocean and proceed with rescue operations.  They pulled up an empty Float Coat.  All inflated with the strobe light flashing from salt-water activation, but no one inside.  Man Overboard headcount an hour later accounted for all personnel aboard the ship.  Nobody fell overboard.  Just an empty Float Coat.\n\nLOLz.  All of us on night shift knew what this was:  Some night-shift sailor was sick and tired of being woken up 5 days in a row for nonsensical Drills and wanted to hand it back to the man.  Woke all the day-shift Officers up in the middle of the night for nothing....just like they did to us 5 days in a row :D   \n\nAnd it worked.  No more Drills during night shift's sleeping hours for the rest of the detachment.  To this day, to my knowledge, nobody has ever claimed this masterpiece of petty revenge.  Who ever you are, I salute you.  \n.  \n.  \n######TL:DR  \nCarrier has General Quarters/Man Overboard Drills during the day while night shift is sleeping for 5 days in a row.  Night shift throws Float Coat overboard in the middle of the night to trigger Man Overboard, waking up all the Officers.  No more Drills while night shift is sleeping.",

Repeated interruptions of people\u2019s sleep leads to fatigue, with the effect on performance similar to the people involved being drunk. How much maintenance got fucked up due to night shift having been woken up in the middle of their \u201cnight\u201d several days in a row?",

Doing it on occasion in the middle of a shift will get people used to the idea of doing this stuff straight out of a sound sleep.  Emergencies can happen at any time of day or night, after all.\n\nThe key words here, though, are \"on occasion.\"  And it should be roughly equal between the middle of day shift and the middle of night shift.",

            "comment": "12 hours a day off while underway on a carrier and complaining?  No wonder Ship's Force could never stand you and your fellow riders.\n\nI spent 8 years of my 20 active duty below decks on carriers (East Coast, not on any of the West Coast ships mentioned in the comments).  On a good day underway, with qualifications, maintenance, and training on top of five &amp; dimes (or when manning was close to where it needed to be, 5 &amp;15 watchstanding) we'd be lucky to get 6 hours off out of every 24 for sleeping and personal time. The norm was closer to 4 hours off out of 20.   This happened every time the ship got underway, whether or not squadrons were assigned.  And we were underway a lot more times without a squadron than with one.  Funny thing, though, we only had these middle-of-the-night phantom man overboards whenever your kind were onboard.  \n\nYour little two week work-up started for you the morning the ship got underway and ended within an hour after the ship pulled back up to the pier.  Ship's Force was there on underway watch rotation several days before shifting colors and usually were there for at least another day after you were on the beach.  Rinse and repeat for every cruise, whether 3 days long or 7 months.\n\nLack of sleep was part of the job, and it's something we adults understood was necessary - no one liked it.  So getting a few hours unbroken sleep was something everyone looked forward to.  And General Quarters drills on a carrier have so many moving parts that they are scheduled well in advance (yeah, I was also part of the Damage Control Training Team.  Add that to the amount of time away from my rack.)   If your Department Head or DivO chose not to let you know, then they'll the ones that needed correcting, not Fireman Timmy who finally has two whole watches off with nothing scheduled to keep him from sleeping.   Sure, \"pick your rate, choose your fate\" is a truism, but why take out your frustration based on a small inconvenience on 3000 other people who are going through the same, if not worse, working schedule and conditions\n\nYou consider this person a hero and deserving of a salute?  Nah, they (and I would bet there was more than one idiot doing this on your and all the other carriers) were assholes.",

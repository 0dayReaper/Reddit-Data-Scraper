    "postText": "My marriage to  Bob was a disaster. He'd not been paying his taxes, owed over a million, not to mention penalties etc. All his businesses failed,  had several lawsuits coming after him, and was trying to go expat to some country that would have him. I wouldn't go. The last thing I wanted in life was to live in a developing country with a stark-raving narcissistic lunatic.\n\nAt that point, I didn't want to be associated with him at all because he was probably up to something shady as usual. It was surprising he wasn't in prison really. Lucky me, my name was never tied to any of his financial shenanigans. I was broke but I came out clean and moved back across the country where my family and real friends were to reset my life and my sanity.\n\nI drew up the divorce papers, mailed them (to his PO box) and for 3 months, he just sat on them. He ghosted me (a regular thing he did when people were of no more use to him)\n\nInterestingly, at that point Einstein was new to Facebook. He didn't realize that if you had a mutual friend (which we did) and you had selected the option to allow friends of friends to post on your page or that if you kept it open, friends of friends could also see your posts unless you changed your privacy settings. \n\nAfter months of frustration, I went on his FB and declared that we had just gotten married and that little detail would be visible to all his friends. Well, boy howdy, The Bob completely shut down his FB (because heaven forbid, his new prey find out he was still married) and I got an email that very night saying the papers were in the mail.\n\nSo fuck you, Bob. I eagerly await the day I read your obit.",

After I was hooked  in I began to see how crazy he was. He had zero compassion for anyone or anything and had to control everything. For instance, he would never let me drive when we were together, even if he was drunk AF and that was every night. I finally started driving my own car instead of risking my life. Once I went to have my car repaired and he became furious that I didn't take it to a mechanic of his choosing. \n\nThe weirdest thing was when one of our employees died unexpectedly, he got mad at me because I mourned him. There are some very fucked up people out there.",

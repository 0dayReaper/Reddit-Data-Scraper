    "postText": "For some backstory, I (20F) live in a dorm at my University. I unfortunately was assigned a room this year right next to this guy (20M), we'll call him Cole; a guy who in the first two weeks of our freshman year dumped my friend and called her a slut to her face. Ever since then I've hated him and his asshole friends who haven't stopped talking shit about her. \n\nLiving next to him this year has been awful. Cole, and his roommate/friends who frequently visit them, yell, bang on the walls, and loudly slut shame women/comment on their bodies. Needless to say, this guy sucks. \n\nSo the other night I was drunk and ordered food while my boyfriend was over. Every time I order from grubhub I make sure to get down to the front door as fast as possible because its common for people to steal orders outside. As I'm heading to the entrance my food was left at, Cole and his friends walk past me with bags of food in their hands. I go outside and my food is gone. Cole sucks so I immediately suspect that he stole it. I thankfully catch the elevator before it closes, and see one of his friends telling him to \"put it back\". I say, \"Is that my food?\" They all awkwardly say yes, and Cole hands me my food. Then another friend says \"Okay well, put the other one back.\" Cole's friend is holding another bag of takeout with my friend's name on it. I say \"That's my friend, I'll take it to him.\" While we are going up floors, I start to cry, as I am inebriated and very overwhelmed by what just happened. Then, everyone in the elevator laughs at me, trying to stifle it with their hands over their mouths. I leave the elevator in tears without anyone of them saying a single \"I'm sorry.\" \n\nI go back home drunk and pissed and hungry. I tell my boyfriend everything and he's pissed. He asks me if I want him to go over and tell him off, even suggesting to slash his tires/key his car. But I wanted to hit him where it really hurts. I go to facebook and find his mother through his account. It only took like 3 minutes to find her. I DMd her and told her EVERYTHING. Not only what just happened, but all the misogynistic and mean things he's said to women and my friends. \n\nA few days pass and my RA texts me that Cole has requested to formally apologize with the RA as a witness. Apparently, since it was attempted theft, the RA would have to report him and it would be put on his permanent record if he didn't apologize. Totally coincidentally, I saw that Cole's mom had opened my message a half and hour earlier. Sounds like his Mom scolded him and probably demanded he apologize. \n\nI went to the apology, thinking to myself \"This better be a scholarship saving apology.\" But he did what I assumed and gave a bullshit, unemotional apology and thanked me for not reporting him. But the satisfaction of mis mother knowing what an asshole he is was all I really needed.",

    "postText": "So, I have lived in a townhouse for the last three years. I live with my husband and two 60lb dogs.\n\nFor a bit of background, I got attacked by a dog just before  my neighbors moved in 2.5 years ago. Which left me with a fear of strange animals up until recently when I was able to work through my trauma with my therapist.\n\nMy neighbors have 4 loud and reactive dogs 3 chihuawas and 1 Australian sheppard which charge the fence whenever they see someone on the other side and bark constantly. This had prevented me from using my back yard for the last two summers.\n\nNow that I have worked past the panic attacks and fear I am spending a majority of weekends in my yard and let my dogs go back and forth freely from the yard. My dogs have been well socialized and don't have any interest in the fense when the other dogs are reacting. Up until yesterday when the neighbors dogs come out I would bring my dogs inside but it would still mean a minute or so for their dogs to calm down. I would let my dogs back outside to play when the neighbors go back in. This was no big deal to me. \n\nNow cue sunday. The neighbors let their dogs out, they react, I bring my dogs in. Same old routine. Except my neighbor curses me under her breath \"keep your fucking door shut\". (This is not the first time they have been rude either)This gets under my skin considering her dogs reactivity is the reason I did not feel comfortable in my own back yard, and it is not my dogs who are reactive. Plus I have always been the one to bring my dogs in, not the neighbor.\n\nSo I've started to be a bit petty, now when the neighbor let's their dogs out, I stay out and play fetch with my dogs while her animals are going apeshit, instead of bringing my dogs inside as I have always done. My dogs love it because they are getting more exercise than before. It's only been three days and my neighbor is exasperated and has to chase her dogs around the garden. (Side note, they have another dog on the opposite side of them which they are equally reactive to, aswell)\n I have patio furniture being delivered tomorrow and I fully expect to enjoy my yard to the fullest this summer. After I week or two I'll probably put up a visual blockade so her dogs can't see mine to be nice but I'm not going to restrict my well trained animals for her untrained ones any longer. \n\nDon't appreciate my courtesy, I won't give it.\n\nUpdate: neighbors decided to cuss me out and tell me to go inside last night. I said no, but put the dogs inside because the neighbors were being aggressive.They said our dogs should be able to be outside to, go inside.\n I said your dogs reactivity is not my problem and they are more then welcome to use your yard. The fact they can't stop charging the fence long enough to piss is your issue and stood in the middle of my yard. \nThey shouted at me to \"get the fuck inside\". \nI told them \"make me\" (a bit childish I know)\nOne told to \" meet them out front\"\nI said\" no, if you want something from me climb over this fence yourself\"\nThey yelled a bit more and I didn't respond and they went inside after a minute. \nI think the neighbors have finally cracked a bit and it's only week 1. \nNot proud and honestly don't want to deal with this nonsense but I'm not going to bend to a bully.",

Then put a board between the fence and the post/mount for the yard wind chimes. So that the board is touching the fence and the post. Then whenever her dogs jump on the fence they'll hit the windchimes. The wind will also hit the windchimes. Also start lighting horrible smelling incense in the yard.",

Much easier to deescalate and redirect when it\u2019s just something they heard. And we have 2 areas where the dogs can see the outside world so can confirm the difference lol.",

For some reason she's pretty ok with hearing dogs and people but not seeing them outside of the house. She went to a sniff spot and the owner's dogs were yapping at her and she didn't care. She would have reacted if she could see them. Still a long way to go in training but she's still young so there's hope.",

Took a shit load of training but I almost have my dog unreactive to my neighbors. Part of it is getting my neighbors to be calm and say hello. Barking starts and my neighbors say \"hello Rex\". Then I also simultaneously say \"no bark\"! It gets better by the week.\n\nMy pupper (cocker spaniel) used to go apeshit whenever he heard an eagle screech on TV (which unfortunately was very common in commercials for a long time).  Over a couple of months, I conditioned him by distracting with squeaky toys every time the sound played.  Now, he doesn't even acknowledge the \"bad\" sound at all.",

Mac always barked once at the door and then he'd give us a bit of time before the second bark. Usually you could get from anywhere in the house between those two barks. Sometimes he got a bit impatient and delivered the third bark just to let you know he's ready NOW.\n\nThe only real training we did is every time he barked outside we immediately went inside. We played with him outside and gave him tons of treats when he was quiet.\n\nWe had him for ten years and every one in our neighborhood thought he was mute.\n\nWhen our neighbors got a yappy dog, they would leave it out for hours. Eventually I confronted them and they stated that they couldn't control them because dogs bark. My response was that kids scream and we teach them when screaming is appropriate. They pushed back more until I asked how many times they heard my dog bark. In ten years how many times. They said none. I told them that's why I'm considered a great neighbor and folks are starting to resent them. I walked off and they actually started training their dog.\n\nRumor has it that they actually asked around and folks told them that yeah their dog was barking for hours everyday. When the parents were at work the boys would put the dog out and put on their headsets to not hear the dog.\n\nI've watched this dog for ten years and I've never seen him get a pat or any type of affection. \ud83d\ude1e",

We usually do what OP did and bring our dog in, he barely reacts to her. \n\nThey scream at the dog to shut the fuck up when she's barking inside too, loud enough that we can hear it inside *our house* and they're both made of fucking brick. They put an electric bark collar on her and it does nothing, she yelps when it shocks her and she keeps on barking. I honestly feel really sorry for her. She was never socialized and she never gets exercise. These people should not own a dog. \n\nWhen our fence is installed later this summer we're going to stop placating them and spend time in our yard with our very well behaved dog.",

Most have to import dogs from other provinces because their is not enough breeder or rescues here. For every rescue dog their is 200 applications. I was lucky. Mine and my husband's coworker was a breeder and we got tatters. I named him tatters because he looked like a scoop of mash potatoes when he was born. He just turned one this month :-)",

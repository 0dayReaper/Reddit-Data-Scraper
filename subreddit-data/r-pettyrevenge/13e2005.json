    "postText": "I have this one coworker who has been with the company since it's inception. My boss used to let her get away with bullying and harassing everyone in the office with no repercussions unless, the animosity was directed at him. When it was directed at him, he would go full on passive aggressive and make her more insecure than she already is.\n\nThis woman is a real miserable bitch. God help the person who brought a mistake she made to her attention! The next 30-60 minutes, sometimes an entire day would be dedicated to finding every mistake the poor soul made.\n\nShe has been really sneaky about not doing her job and pawning her work off on others. She will busy herself with trivial shit and say \"dealing with so and so took me over an hour\" or \"I have a lot on my plate, I guess that slipped my mind. Would you mind handling it?\"\n\nYesterday, I figured out one of her tactics. Someone needed a letter of on time payment from their previous provider to have their deposit waived. One company has a dedicated broker line for us, specifically. They have stated before to please email for letters of on time payment, do not call the broker line as that is for emergencies. When she was pressed about a task that needed a letter of on time payment, she said she emailed the client and said a conference call was in order. She was told by several of us that was not the proper protocol. ***She knew this, but she did not want to send the email because that is too much like work, so she danced around the issue***. Only thing, I called her out on it and it didn't work this time. She spent more time arguing than it took for her to send the flipping email. My boss even got in the Slack conversation and told her to stop arguing and do her job. That is all she ever gets/got, a little slap on her meat hook of a hand.\n\nShe proceeded to rip me a new one in a personal Slack and told me what a Cunt I am, blah blah.\n\nI copied that Slack and went back through the other Slacks she sent my personal channel calling my boss a bald bitch, saying she didn't blame his wife for cheating on his cheap, rude ass, calling his son a piece of shit, calling him an elitist buttcrack, etc.\n\nI sent all of those to my boss and told him I think her language is rather unprofessional and don't appreciate being called a C word. ( I really don't care, I wanted him to see the stuff directed at him\").\n\nHe sent a Slack saying he would be a few hours late this morning. We all work from home. He drove to her house, fired her and collected his office equipment. As prideful as she is, of course, she didn't tell a soul. He came in, set up a Zoom and told us \"Negative McGee\" is no longer with the company.\n\nPetty AF and I don't give any fucks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, my I had no idea this would get so much attention! I guess everyone has experienced their own version of \"Negative McGee\". ",

I got laid off after a bit during one of the economic downturns which in the long run was a very good thing.  I do still have the doodle of a monster that I named after her on my fridge though.  When I get frustrated with my current job it reminds me how much worse it could be.",

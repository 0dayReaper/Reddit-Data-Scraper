    "postText": "So my husband (54m) and I (52f) have conflicting schedules so we don\u2019t get to watch a lot of tv shows and movies together. The problem is we have the same tastes, but he has a big mouth. He always starts with a I won\u2019t ruin it for you then promptly gives me enough info to ruin it for me. Drives me up the wall and down the other side. We read a lot also and he was given a book from someone who told him he\u2019d love it, gotta read it. Well they were right, sucked him right in and he was loving it. Cue the revenge! It was a pretty big book about 700 pages or so. He got about 3/4 into it and while he was at work I cut out the last 5 pages of it. \n\nNow that\u2019s how you ruin an ending ya bitch!\n\nEdit: 1. Normally I\u2019m anal about the way books are treated. I won\u2019t even dog ear the pages. The book was his, not someone else\u2019s. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if it was. 2. This is petty revenge, not tit for tat or AITAH. Just telling him the end lacks imagination, and besides I\u2019d rather know what happened than didn\u2019t. 3. We\u2019ve been together since I was 17 and he 19. Our marriage is fantastic, he isn\u2019t going anywhere!",

Do the whole \"I don't want to spoil it for you, but keep an eye on how the narrator seems to always highlights how Jody is standing to the side every time they find a body\" routine. Bonus points if you actually give spoilers for the sequel with items in the first book he should note.",

Not saying be stupid and careless about issues, but it really softens the edges of the inevitable conflicts and emotional ups and downs.",

She couldn't watch the episode on Sunday nights when it aired due to her schedule so she'd be a couple days behind. This dude loved straight up spoiling episodes for her and she would get so upset and he would promise not to do it again and then of course would. This incident happened during season 3 sometime. \n\nI had read the books when season 2 was airing. So I knew what was to come in future seasons. After the third time of my friend telling me that this douche canoe had ruined an episode for her, I just patiently waited until \"the Rains of Castamere\". About an hour before it aired I messaged the dude to ask one thing, made sure I has his attention, and then unleashed a quick couple of sentences that told him about the Red Wedding. \n\nDude was so mad. SO MAD. I warned my friend who thought it was the funniest damn thing she had ever heard and didn't even care that it got spoiled for her during his subsequent meltdown about what a bitch I am. \n\nThey broke up not long after and she met her now fiance who is the kindest, most dedicated man, and they are so happy together. This dude would never ruin GOT for anyone. I'm giving the speech at their upcoming wedding in July. \n\nIf you just so happen to find this, fuck you Gabe. She was way too good for you.

    "postText": "Admittedly, I've probably posted this story in r/talesfromretail at some point, but I figure it also could technically fit here. \n\n**Reason for the revenge**\n\nMany moons ago, I worked at a store that was &gt;!not!&lt; the **Best** place to **Buy** electronics. \n\nI was in the cellular sales area selling cell phones by the sea shore. Now, I *do*n't like to brag, but, I was *really* good at my job. I had worked at Radioshack for several years before selling phones- and I knew all the carriers, all the hardware, everything like the back of my hand. \n\nSo, coming into that store, I had 3 years experience, I worked there for 3 more years. Over that time I had become the \"fix it\" guy. I would fix broken accounts, I would solve complicated issues, Geek Squad would seek me out any time someone ventured near their area with a phone.\n\nI trained 12 employees, my assistant manager, **and** my direct manager all on how the systems worked and how to sell phones. \n\nIt was during October of my third year that I became aware of something- I was making ever so slightly less than the new hires I had been training. Obviously, I did take some issue with this- I had well exceeded my job's roles and description and was frequently acting as de-facto manager for my department (because my manager would ask my opinion on all phone related issues, and would immediately enact that opinion). \n\nSo, I decided to make a reasonable ask- I was, at the time, making **$15/hr**, the new hires were making **$16/hr**, the highest pay for my job role at the time was **$17.50/hr**.\n\nI decided to ask our **GM** to put me on the high end for my job role. I wasn't asking for a promotion, I wasn't asking for anything in excess of what I should logically be making. \n\n**Paul (the GM)** is what a human would be- if one were to be crafted *entirely* from cardboard. He had a monotone voice, and I had never seen evidence of him having emotions in the three years I worked for him. \n\nSo, I asked **Paul** (name &gt;!not!&lt; changed), to put me on the higher end of the pay scale, and I laid out my case- \n\n1. I was making less than the new hires despite 3 years of tenure\n\n2. I had trained all the new hires, my assistant manager, and my manager\n\n3. I was a valuable asset to the team, since I knew every nuance of my job.\n\nI have long since forgotten the specific words, but I will **never** forget how I felt.\n\n**Paul** spent *15 goddamn minutes* walking me around the circumference of the store making a multitude of excuses as to why they couldn't pay me fairly, as well as a multitude of platitudes as to why I should be content with what I was getting. \n\nTruth be told, I had tuned him out by minute 2 of his monologue and was already internally planning my revenge.\n\n**The revenge** \n\nMy revenge was simple. I quit. As you may suspect from the title of the post, I quit the day before Black Friday. \n\nI spent the rest of october job hunting, and I made sure I had interviews lined up. (The job I got after that, while more lucrative, was significantly more soul sucking, after which, I moved on to my *current job* which is both lucrative **AND** fun)\n\nTwo days before Black Friday, I rolled up to Paul and informed him of my imminent departure. I was *very* pleased to get the **exact** reaction I was hoping for. \n\nHis eyes went wide, and his face (somehow) went even whiter. (Some say that a new shade of white was produced that day, one that Anish Kapoor was immediately banned from even observing).\n\nHe didn't sputter, but his voice *did* crack slightly. He was desperately trying to keep his composure- \n\n**Paul:** Well, that's a shame... *Right before* Black Friday? \n\n**Me:** Yep. Normally, I'd give two weeks notice... but, these are the circumstances I'm afraid.\n\n**Paul:** Well, is there anything we can do to get you to stay?\n\n**Me:** Well, you *could've* bumped my pay when I asked. But as it stands right now, no. \n\n**Paul:** ... \n\n**Me:** Welp, good luck with Black Friday.\n\nNow, I'd like to say that I slept in on Black Friday, since I was no longer working... That would be a lie. I went shopping (like a good american drone) and picked up a rain jacket for pretty cheap, then swung by Best Buy for a cheap TV. Things were... chaotic.",

I think part of it is the fact that they have to offer more to attract talent, and the other part is businesses do some REALLY weird stuff with their budgets.  For this they may have a \"hire new people\" budget that allows for the new pay, but no room in the existing payroll budget for raises to the same level.  Same with most businesses where you get penalized for saving them money.  Didn't spend every dime they allotted you? Guess you didn't need it, now your new max next quarter is the lesser amount you spent last quarter, regardless of if you have a need for equal/higher budget",

Knew how to do everything, my co-workers often came to me for help with things, even my *manager* was asking me how to do things in certain instances. I was also the one that got stuck training every new employee we hired.\n\nWe got two new hires at the same time that I trained in tandem. One was a lazy little shit that would hide behind the register and watch Netflix. The other was, admittedly, a hard worker but had a boisterous attitude and had a tendency to \"one up\" everything.\n\nOne day the topic of pay got brought up (it was right after minimum wage in my state had changed). I told them how much I was making and how long I had been there to give them an idea of the pay wage scale. The boisterous one laughed and said he was making more than me. I called bullshit, he showed me his paystub and I was livid. \n\nThe lazy little shit was also pissed because they were hired at the same time and he was getting more money than him, but he didn't have a leg to stand on and knew it.\n\nThis kid I fucking trained, which knew nothing about the retail job he was hired to do, was making like a $1.50 more than I was. And I'd been there five years. So I went to the union and filed a grievance. \n\nThe result? He was hired in at a higher pay rate because he had \"previous\" retail experience. (He claimed his mom owns a store and he worked there in the past.) They declined to adjust my pay to (at the very least) match his.\n\nThere is a slight silver lining. There was a way to request a raise for specific employees, based on outstanding performance. This request had to be approved by the department lead. Well, the department lead was stepping down from his position, and he absolutely loved me. So my boss put in the request and he approved it.\n\nSo for the last year and a half I worked there I was capped out and making the same amount as my coworkers with the highest seniority (25+ years). Got a job making $6 more for 1/3rd of the work.",

I guarantee I'm still making less than the new hires. Luckily I don't really care and I don't really need the job. I just do it for some extra spending money, and I use the money as a vacation fund. Yes, I'd like to make more money. Luckily a new opportunity has landed in my lap that's more than $2 more an hour and can possibly morph into a full-time position. So my fingers are crossed and I'm making myself as valuable as possible. Currently working both, and if it becomes more regular I will quit the grocery store.",

Staying for as long as I did was a huge mistake. You get completely take for granted, as the more you do the more they pile on. I started in a large team but as people left I was asked to take on their work as well as my own as a \u2018stop gap\u2019. Well being the dumbass I was I would knuckle down and work even harder, so of course they saw no need to replace those people. Eventually I was doing the work of at least 3 people on the same salary I\u2019d started at. What\u2019s more, when they did recruit new people those colleagues (even those with way less experience) were paid more them me because of \u201cmarket competition\u201d. Who do you think then trained those people? Yup, dummy here. Even though I was given \u2018above average\u2019 pay raises because raises were done by percentage and capped on a scale that resulted in them still never boosting my salary anywhere near enough. None of my newer colleagues stayed very long either, because the younger generation were savvier than my parents. I\u2019d have moved on too if I hadn\u2019t felt such misplaced loyalty. Plus I was very fond of one of my colleagues.\n\nGot the last laugh though. Eventually the team shrunk down to 2 people, the other had also been there a number of years and experiencing the same workload increase/salary stagnation. Between us we plotted and resigned at the exact same time, completely leaving our bosses in a situation they had created - you see they really HAD taken us for granted and when we left we took a combined 30+ year\u2019s experience with us, leaving them with the work of a full team and no one with the knowledge to do it. \n\nThat colleague is doing very well now too.

Sadly, i broke my knee and both wrists while making an emergency delivery for my boss (someone got stabbed by an ex bf and couldnt finish her route, so i handled it) \n\n2 days earlier, i had asked for a pay raise since i was a main trainer for 3 stores and i covered 6 stores, changing daily as stores needed help. \n\nHad i not broken my knee and wrists, i wouda quit cuz the boss said \u201chard no\u201d cuz im \u201cslower than molasses\u201d even tho, im the go to guy. And have had to drive the work van wildly different places after work. (Think 80 miles away from home and work paying for me to uber home) im still too damn slow at my job \ud83d\ude44",

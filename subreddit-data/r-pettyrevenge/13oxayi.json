    "postText": "TLDR at end:  happy story\n\nGrew up in a totalitarian dictatorship, and my dad taught me that 'being nice' is a powerful defensive weapon and can also be very fun.\n\nAt first, I did not understand, but, fast forward a decade and a half, a stint in a UN refugee camp and now, a life as a newlywed in a Western country - and I understood.\n\nAs newlyweds, we moved into the suburbs, and got a dog - a really, really great dog that was friendly and sweet - but a total mutt, and we walked him regularly.  \n\nOne couple in our neighbourhood - nice looking people - had two terrier-type dogs that looked like carbon copies of each other, except that one was 'standard size' (about as tall as the average German Shephard, perhaps taller but slighter built) while the other dog was a mini-me version of the big one.  He walked the big dog, she walked the little dog:  and they were haughty, to put it mildly.  \n\nThey would not ever reply to any neighbours who said hello to them as they walked by (unusual in our neighbourhood), and they certainly were not going to permit our common mongrel  to mix with their fancy dogs.\n\nSo, I ran an experiment of my dad's theory - be really, really nice to them.  \n\nLike, really nice.\n\nI would not jus say hello, I would smile, ask how they were doing in the mildest, kindest gentlest ways - but consistently and persistently. \n\nAfter 3-4 months, they would acknowledge me - perhaps not with a greeting, but with a nod.\n\nAfter 6 months, they would smile back - and eventually, THEY would say hello to me!\n\nVictory was mine!\n\nBut, there is more.\n\nThe couple moved out of my neighbourhood and I had not contact with them for, perhaps, a year.  Then I had a baby and started attending a 'mother and baby group' where a nurse checks on the baby's growth and development and moms with similarly aged babies let the little ones play/crawl while they (the moms) decompress and chat.\n\nNo sooner had I sat down than a woman waved at me from across the room asking me to join her - happy and smiling and showing me her baby and gushing over mine - it turned out to be that same lady of the haughty dog walking couple!\n\nHow awesome a petty revenge:  I made her like me despite herself!\n\n\nTLDR:  persisted in being nice to snooty neighbours, eventually, they were nice to me.",

When we moved in last year I greeted her a handful of times giving her the benefit of doubt or blaming it on she just didn't hear me.  Eventually I stopped. My husband try to be nice to her as well to no avail. I really truly despised her in the beginning. But here lately we've been making little jokes about her and her husband just to make living next to her more bearable. They're harmless in nature, husband and wife type of fun. If you're married you definitely know what I'm talking about. \n\nThis couple knocked on our door even accusing us that we let our Great Pyrenees poop in her yard whilst she's not home. Mind you, there's many stray dogs that frequent our area. And they know this! The husband voiced that \"We have cameras\". And kindly my husband responded with \"That's good, you should check the footage\" type of response lol! Other guy stayed quiet. We all were calm and civil, and I pulled out my nice card because that's who I am anyway. I tried to get him to like me at least, I'm not sure how I came off to him.  After this confrontation it resulted in my husband putting up our own cameras the very same day, not to mention newer expensive cams. They had one camera, well, we put out four of them (yes we were being petty that day)! Weirdly it was funny, our across the street neighbor came over and loved us for it. Why? Because they don't like them much. I should mention that nobody really likes this couple because they are very rude. Moving forward, we have reached a point that I kind of enjoy looking over, making eye contact with her and then my husband and I will talk about her or make fun of something silly about her. \"I hope her grass dies\" type of humor. We don't talk about her in front of her, it's only behind closed doors.  We water our grass, and she proceeds to do the same at similar times. If we get near her fence in the back, she comes out to pretend she's doing something so she can see what we're doing. \n\nThat expression love to hate you is fairly true coming from her. So at this phase, one year later, I'm going to try and be nice to her again and see what happens. \ud83d\ude02",

    "postText": "My roommate enjoys nice long showers in the morning using all of the hot water. I realized that he literally jumps out of bed and runs into the bathroom when he hears my alarm. I started putting my alarm on silence for a while and this was working well enough but I still missed my morning shower several times because of their unreasonable long showers. So I just started moving to two alarms one alarm about an hour and a half before I normally get up. This has caused him for about two weeks now to get up really early run the hot water out and be out with enough time for it to be warm again. Small victories are nice.\n\nEdit: \n-It is possible to run out of hot water (really who questions that?). This IS intended to be a light-hearted post hence the petty revenge. My roommate is not a piece of shit we've been friends since 8th grade. Everyone does things their roommates don't like myself included. Despite what people seem to think we do talk about house issues, sometimes people forget or don't realize how annoying it is or what they're doing, which is why I petty revenged.",

I don't know the voodoo, but they claimed it would alert (vibrate) when you were in a light sleep state to \"gently\" wake you from your slumber.    I could get 5 or 9 hours and it waking me up worked as easily with 5 as it did with 9 hours of sleep.",

Except, she like to hit snooze over and over and over \u2014 not getting up until close to my shower time. She\u2019d shower, then there would be no hot water for me. It came to an end when I started showering before her and left her with cold water. She started showering at night.",

We'd get back, he'd douse himself in a gallon of Drakkar Noir (late 80s) and get dressed. Our shared barracks room fucking reeked. That lasted 2 weeks. Informed (not asked) my platoon sergeant I was moving to an empty Sr NCO room that had a private latrine. He objected, I had him go to my room, one whiff was all it took. E4 mafia for the win.\n\nTo this day I can't smell Drakkar Noir without gagging.",

They are commonly bought by resorts who want to conserve water but also want to make sure their guests have a great shower.\n\nI bought 6 Bricor shower heads for friends of mine as gifts and every single one raves about them. One was able to avoid replacing their water heater with a larger one because the Bricor saved enough water to allow their whole family to shower on one tank.\n\nIf you do end up buying one please let me know what you think.",

Once I moved away into my own city apartment I finally had so much hot water, and man was it hot! I would take the longest hottest showers and come out with nearly scalded red skin that steamed when I stepped out of the bathroom. Until one day I made a nice homemade hair mask to make my hair super soft and shiny.\n\n  \n\n\nIt was made of olive oil, mayonaise, honey, eggs, and mushed avacado probably. I worked it into all of my hair and let it sit for an hour or so, all spa like and then slipped into my hot hell shower for a rinse to reveal my silky soft new hair. As I began to rinse the hair mask out, a thick gooeye clump formed beneath my fingers. Scrambled. Fucking. Eggs.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nDo you know how long it takes to comb 3 large, stinky, crumbled, steam-cooked, hot eggs out of waist-length sopping wet hair? Because I do.",

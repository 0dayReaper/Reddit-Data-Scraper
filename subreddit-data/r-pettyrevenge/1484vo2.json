    "postText": "I work in the financial services industry. My manager, we\u2019ll call her Linda, is the epitome of the Peter principle. For those who aren\u2019t familiar, it\u2019s basically when you are promoted to a level beyond your skill set. Linda was constantly missing work, leaving me in charge as the only supervisory delegate with the proper licensing to manage in her absence. \n\nAround Christmas, she decided to take the two weeks prior and up to Christmas, and I was to take the week after once she returned. She called me on my first day of vacation and said she was canceling all vacation for the remainder of the year. It turned into a shouting match and she eventually screamed at me to \u201ctake my goddamn vacation\u201d and hung up on me. \n\nAbout 6 months later, I was going for a promotion for a job I was well qualified for. I killed it in the interviews and gave a brilliant presentation. I knew the other two candidates and I was clearly the top runner. She was on the hiring panel, even though I would no longer be her direct report. She blocked me from getting the job. \n\nFast forward several years and I am now in a new position in the same company. My new manager reached out to me and asked if I knew Linda. I said, \u201cYeah, why?\u201d He explained that she was applying for my same role and would be on my team. Petty revenge time! I told him she was the worst team player I had ever had, and I believed she was only doing it to ensure she stayed around long enough for all of her company stock grants to vest. (I assumed correctly that she was being managed out and was looking for a place to land.)\n\nShe didn\u2019t get the job. She ended up leaving the company and likely left between $300-500k USD on the table as unvested stock.",

Really should have contacted HR about it because once you are on vacation, she really couldnt call you back. Hell, you shouldnt have even answered the phone because quite frankly your on vacation.",

Let\u2019s say to make it easy they vest 25% a year.\n\nSo after the first year on the vest date,  2500 options are exercisable.  After the second year, you get another 2500 options, next year, another 2500, and after the fourth year, the final 2500.\n\nSometimes they will give out additional options based on performance, company goals met, etc.  Each block will have its vesting date and schedule.\n\nThis also happens for other incentives like Restricted Stock Units - RSUs.  This is company stock that you can only sell back to the company, but are otherwise identical to stocks.\n\nAnother incentive that vests can be company 401k contributions.  Some companies will match up to a certain percent of your contributions, say, up to 6% or max $6000 a year, but for any or all of that to belong to you it may \u201ccliff vest\u201d; for my employer I had to work for 3 years before it was ALL mine - if I left earlier, none of it was mine.  But after 3 years their additional contributions no longer required vesting - they were all mine immediately upon receipt.\n\nYour own contributions and gains from them are always fully vested, but employer contributions will often require you to stay there to vest according to their vesting schedule.\n\nThese are ways to encourage employee retention and reward employees based on company performance or individual performance.\n\nOP\u2019s former boss couldn\u2019t find a new job within the organization to pickup those remaining options, RSUs, or 401k awards, so she had to leave $300k-$500k on the table.  She was hoping to do what we call \u201cquiet vesting\u201d in a low-profile place, but her karma was bad.\n\nBe nice to people on your way up. You\u2019ll meet them on your way down.",

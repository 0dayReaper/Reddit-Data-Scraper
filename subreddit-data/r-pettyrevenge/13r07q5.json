    "postText": "Hello! First time posting on this sub and I apologize for any formatting errors as I\u2019m on mobile (Mods please let me know I need to fix anything). \n\nA little backstory for context: I served six years in the US Military and was one of two people in a 1000 man unit who could drive literally any military vehicle and many couldn\u2019t drive them at all or couldn\u2019t drive the specific variant. As such I was called upon to drive platoons out for training A LOT. I got so good at driving these huge trucks (think dump truck but bigger) I could back them up and park them perfectly on my own. Come to find out this skill translates very well to civilian driving. \n\nRevenge: my family reunion is on cape cod every year and one of me and my cousins favorite things to do is go to Provincetown for the day, hang out, shop, drink, etc. There is a parking lot next to the harbor that you have to pay $25 to park in and that\u2019s where we usually park because it\u2019s a flat rate and you can be there as long as you need.\n\nThe only spot available was in the middle of the lot and a minivan had parked about a foot over the line into the spot I needed. Now I drive a lifted four door Jeep Wrangler with large all terrain tires that protrude past the edge of the fender flares. I can get as close as I need to in order to be an inconvenience while still being able to squeeze my way out of my door, but because of the way they parked I had to be closer to still be parked legally. \n\nI was able to squeak it into the spot so that the wheels were roughly half and inch away from the drivers side front door as well as the drivers side sliding rear door. I popped the roof panel above the drivers seat in my car off and climbed through the roof, then set it back on top and made it took like it was still sealed. \n\nThe cream of the crop dear reader is that by the time I was done the car on the other side of them had left, my uncle had rolled up in his Grand Cherokee to park and hang with us. He saw what I did, immediately started laughing and had me use his car to legally block them in on the other side as well and then I climbed out of his sunroof. They had backed in and were unable to open their trunk with how bad their parking job was and how close they were to the cars behind them so there was no possible way they could open any of the doors on their car. We giggled about it and went to go have fun. \n\nFast forward roughly five and a half hours we finish partying and come back to go home. Low and behold, The people were sitting there next to their car! Based on the beet red sunburn they both had, they had to have been there a WHILE. We got the angriest looks when I went through the roof to free my Jeep and my uncle did the same with his. We were all laughing our asses off the whole way back to the house. \n\nMoral of the story: don\u2019t park like an asshole \n\nTLDR; car takes up two spots in a very busy parking lot and I block him in\n\nEdit: holy shit I wasn\u2019t expecting it to blow up like this, thanks guys!\n\nSecond edit: a lot of questions about my uncles Jeep being able to be parked legally and still block them in have been asked. My uncles Jeep while only a Grand Cherokee is also modified, it has fender flares that stick out a good five or six inches from the rest of the body. At the time he was prepping it for wheels tires and spacers. Legally, as long as the tires are still within the lines the body can be over the line. That\u2019s how we managed to still be legal while still blocking them in. Hope that cleared it up\n\nEdit 3: I forgot to mention that this was in August with the temp at close to 93\u00b0F. This is peak season for tourism on the cape and especially in Provincetown",

If 2 cars are parked in 2 spots, 1 car, by definition, cannot be taking 2 spots. \n\nRegardless; it\u2019s not even the point of my comment. The action by OP was an asshole move. Period. Doesn\u2019t even account for the fact that the car next to the \u201cbad parker\u201d could\u2019ve parked bad, forcing them into a shitty park job. OP is so proud of themselves for this but they shouldn\u2019t be. OP is a prick",

One area is marked for staff (near the building's side door) and you needed a decal to park there, but some students realized that we had no enforcement so they would park there.  One morning I ended up having to park farther away in the general lot, which was annoying although I didn't really care, but as I walked to the building one of the students who was illegally parked made a smug remark about it.  I pointed out that he was illegally parked, and he flipped me off!\n\nA couple days later I drove in with my big old ugly van because I was delivering some equipment for the school.  I found those same student cars illegally in the staff parking lot, but I needed to park near the building so I could unload.  So I parked sideways in front of those student cars.  Curbing and a hill prevented those cars from moving until I moved my van.  I unloaded the equipment and left my van where it was (it was at the end of a short parking lot road spur, so I was not blocking anything other than those students).\n\nI had classes all morning, so I was not available to move my van until lunchtime.  At about 11:00 some unhappy students interrupted my class, wanting me to move so they could leave.  I recognized the kid who had flipped me off.  Told them to wait until my class was over.  \n\nAbout twenty minutes later they came back with the school administrator and interrupted my class again.  I explained to the administrator that they were parked illegally (due to the decal requirements) but I wasn't (I had a decal for that area, and there were no signs or markings forbidding how I was parked).  Made them all wait until my class was over - including going about fifteen minutes overtime to make up the lost time due to their interruptions.  \n\nWe got parking lot enforcement security after that.",

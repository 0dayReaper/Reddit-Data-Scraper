    "postText": "Let me paint a picture. It was the end of the school year, and finals were due. I was randomly partnered up with probably the biggest asshole in my class. We both were assigned to do different parts of the project (we each were supposed to do half of it), but he wanted different. He never did any work, the type of person to bully the nerd for them to do his homework. Let's call him AS (a hole student). Of course, AS did nothing and told me to do both parts, so I did. I put my name on everything he was supposed to do, and at the end of the presentation, the teacher asked, \" Why is your name on everything?\" AS started getting red. \"Uh, because I did it, AS did nothing.\" After class, the teacher had a talk with us and asked for proof. I showed the teacher everything. This was on a Google slide, and I made a physical presentation as well (AS was supposed to do the physical presentation), every peice of cardboard and diagram had my name on it. I showed the teacher that my account had been the only one to edit the slides. AS obviously denied it, but hey, at the end of the day, I'm not the one repeating social studies.\n\nEdit: The teacher handed the physical presentation back to me and said, \"Make sure you right your name on the parts you did\" to me and AS. His face went red again like the day before as I wrote my name on everything. \"Any objections?\" I said to AS each time I wrote my name down. I don't feel bad for him because he's rich and acts like he's higher up than everyone.",

                    "comment": "I was a teacher and (when teaching at the junior college level) sometimes assigned group projects, but with the caveat you chose your own team, you propose your project and the member roles, and the grades depend on completing the project with individual grades for your own portion. Students didn't have to be in a group, they could propose independent projects. Larger groups would propose more complex projects as there were more people to split tasks between.\n\nI could also facilitate grouping, if two solo projects proposed were similar, I would suggest they talk; sometimes they might join together.\n\nThese were for programming courses, so learning to divide up work, create and follow a plan are important aspects of gaining competency. Groups were also allowed to modify their plans and submit a revised proposal if they realized the initial project was over ambitious. Which is another important skill. The only requirements were making software that worked (non-functioning software would not get passed) and learning the programming skills needed to do what they were working on. This way of doing group projects was really powerful and my students loved it. \n\nI encouraged them to work outside of their comfort zone. If their background was graphic arts, DON'T do the graphics work on your project, perhaps be in charge of the database. You can coach the person who is well-versed in writing to create the graphics, while she coaches the person doing research and writing, etc. It was very dynamic and many interesting projects got completed.",

I always divide my groups into (self-sorted) software \"kindergarteners\" and \"graduate students\" and divide lectures by topic \"intro, intermediate, advanced.\" Then divide lectures into \"intro, intermediate, advanced\" and start classes early so that I start at intro, proceed to intermediate, then advanced. Students are welcome to join at whatever level they're at on the topic, and ignore me when I'm talking gobblily-goop for them. If my course is 3 hours, I schedule the lab for 4 and start at intro.\n\nThis gives an opportunity to advance in topics you don't know, and ignore what you're already competent at.\n\nIt's why I loved teaching community college!",

Students are aware of most classmate's skills and can decide to work with whoever will advantage them, or refuse to work with those that will disadvantage them. And, if they care about the consequences of their choice for a team, they'll be careful who they work with.\n\nHowever, if they allow themselves to be pressured by peers (such as the football players in a class forming a group and not allowing anyone else in that group) and then fail to execute on a project, that is ALSO an important learning outcome. As much as possible, as an adult I feel it is important to allow natural consequences to be what trains kids. \n\nAs a teacher you should be aware of who your students are to help guide them. You'll have kids with special needs, such as learning disabilities, emotional issues, health issues, ESL, etc. And you'll watch group formation and assist groupings where needed. Maybe the football team won't let Sam into the group next time since all he does is distract, never producing. And Sam then is forced to work on his own, no other group wants to deal with his bullying. Or Anna, who is really smart but very bossy, might be the perfect partner for Sam.",

    "postText": "Manager has been out with some bullshit or other for nearly two weeks, for the third time this year. i'm really getting sick of learning that they're sick, or their kids are sick, or their cat is sick, or WHATEVER, half an hour into my shift. We are a 2 person kitchen. This person has become extremely comfortable with dumping their workload on me last minute - Thurs before last I told them I had to leave early that day or miss a class, and they were out the door \"sick\" with a stomachache not even 20 minutes later.\n\nBut whatever. All this is doing is making *our* bosses' impression of them worse, when they're already in hot water for inaccurate numbers and being months behind on paperwork. Anyways. I booked a full week off with the person in charge of scheduling and cleared it with the person in charge of finances. Manager can find out when I don't show up on the 20th. I'll be about 600 miles away by then.",

I didn't grow up on HP, my sister was into it more. but i *loved* Ender's Game, and the author there started getting nasty homophobic right when I was getting into the meat of the series. It seemed so paradoxical. It's a weird, personal-impersonal betrayal. Like, yeah, if you met this author at a grocery store neither of you would remember it, but they affected you profoundly, and you can never shake the sense of danger that comes with just *knowing* that they hate people like you. But they can apparently relate to you, as long as you're *not* you, they can say things like \"muggleborns are valid\" or w/e and heel-turn to \"You're a disgusting predator for trying to be yourself\".",

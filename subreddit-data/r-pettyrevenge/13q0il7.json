    "postText": "More moons then I want to think about I had a house party/going away party before I moved out of my parent house,  I  wasn't yet  18 and parent didn't seem to care, they had just been married and new spouse made it very clear I wasn't welcome in the home because  1. Newlyweds need their privacy and 2. Their uber religious son let them know I was seen entering a gay bar. \n\nSo house party was apparently amazing I truly don't remember much at all. Of. The. Entire.  Weekend. I woke one morning in the tub kind of party bender. The adult parental units returned that Sunday afternoon just in time to host their post church Bible study and potluck. After a hellious hungover mad dash to clean house and have the adults none the wiser, all before I left for my night job and cue my parental unit calling me to the Bible group to show off how wonderful of a parent they are and ordered a hug and kiss before I leave. \n\nNow these public displays bugged me something awful, mainly because it was totally fake, and done to make an impression on the Bible group and had no other function. Here I am dreading the hug and fake affection, as I lean in for the public torture, my eyes darting about in anxiety lock onto, behind a happy wedding picture of the Newlyweds is a McFish sandwich. When did it arrive? Probably over my party weekend, but that doesn't matter how the helll am I going to get it out. Also, how the hell is it not stinking already. I can't strategically remove it right now. All I can do is get out before I become the subject of bible sins and have all the, in my mind, rubbish forcefully shoved down my throat. So I skedaddled like a cartoon roadrunner, and promptly completely forgot about the sandwich. I moved out the following day, when I got home that night there was a suitcase laying on my bed and a note from new step-parent saying use it(suitcase) asap. \n\nI moved into friends house, their parents were amazing and reminded me of what a parent was, my parent died in my early teens, I invited friends family to my graduation and not my parental until or their new spouse.\n\nI forgot about the fish sandwich until years afterwards, my parental unit divorced the bible thumper and we have done a wonderful job building a relationship. We were talking about statue of limitations and when do they pass for children and parent relationships. Then they mentioned my snitch of a stepbrother had a party when they went out of town a week or 5 after I moved out, and someone left a fish sandwich  behind his wedding picture, among driving through the garage and into laundryroom. \n\nNow I know I easily could have admitted the fish sandwich was a leftover from my party, statue of limitations has expired after 15 years right? My parent didn't complain for 10 minutes about the attempted turning the house into a drive-thru, but they did about the fish sandwich. So, I let snitch-brother to this day take the blame for the fishy stink bombing of the house.",

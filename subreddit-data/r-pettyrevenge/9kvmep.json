    "postText": "I have one incredible \"the HOA isn't the asshole in this case\" story.\n\nMy dad is African American and went on a walk around the community park around 3 in the afternoon. He was wearing jeans, a polo, etc.\n\nSomeone who had recently moved in (maybe only 2 weeks) sent an email to the president of the HOA because they were unable to attend the meeting. They said they had a photo of a 'suspicious person' who had been 'obviously casing peoples houses to rob them' and included photos of my dad. The president of the HOA emailed back that they were \"very concerned after seeing the photos\" and would \"stop by her house to discuss the issue in person\". The scheduled a time to talk and come up with safety strategies.\n\nMy dad is the president of the HOA. \n\nHe said the look on her face when she opened the door was priceless. He then proceeded to discuss the 'issue' with her like she hadn't emailed a picture of him asking her \"Now why did you feel concerned for your safety?\" and \"What about him made you think this man was a threat?\"\n\nShe didn't send any more complaints. \n\n\n\n",

A police car came up to us and told us that they received a call that saying that neighbors saw 3 Latino kids trying to break into a car. We were the only Latinos that lived in that neighborhood at the time. I was scared to death when the police came by because at the time I thought they would just take us away for no reason but now that I think about it I laugh to myself a little because whoever called the cops on 3 little scrawny nerdy brown kids with glasses had some serious issues.",

However, as he was dressed like an every day person in normal clothes, no excuse could be made and we all know she was accusing him of being suspicious based on nothing other than the fact he was walking while black.",

I won't vote for anyone who is against it. There are other core things in my life and I weigh everything against the candidates and vote for the one that I feel will best represent me. I have family that is diehard red and done diehard blue. Just sad when they vote in people who are going against their views because they are a certain party.",

It's true that sometimes I vote for a near certain loser. I feel good knowing I voted on my beliefs.

What are *they tracking?*\"\n\nBlew my mind. And it was sad, too, because they were so concerned about the kids' well-being, and meanwhile, were totally unable to take advantage of all the services that could have helped their kids one of whom we believed was dyslexic. I think that my kids and the neighbor kids (all children of government employees at the time) actually taught her kids how to read. No idea what she was on but the wine was out from 12 noon forward. :( And I'm not opposed to wine, not at all... but if you're homeschooling, there are a few hours left in the school day is all.",

Have the HOA save up money to prepare for costs instead of just upping the rates whenever something comes up.  Plan on maintenance to reduce the need for costly repairs.  And don't spend funds earmarked for something else.\n\nSecondly, be reasonable.  Maybe there's a reason that one household isn't able to maintain their lawn as regularly as they'd like.  How will you know unless you talk to them?  If infractions are met with an immediate fee, relations are going to become hostile between the HOA and the residents.  When talking to people that have first time infractions, don't accuse, but note what was wrong and figure out a way to fix it that works for everyone before you get to the nastygram in the mailbox stage.\n\nThird, you will have people that will report EVERYTHING.  Those people have nothing better to do.  Find a way to make them a part of the solution instead of just part of the problem.  Reporting everything is a very negative attitude, but they're also paying for the community to look nice and follow certain guidelines.  Sometimes, you just can't win and they will never do anything other than complain and report.  But sometimes you can help refocus their thoughts towards something more positive, such as leaning on them to provide solutions.  Asking how they don't violate the rule and using that information to assist others makes them feel like they're being heard without having to cause an infraction.\n\nFourth, make sure the meetings are in a location that people can get to easily in both time and location.  Some shady HOAs will hold these meetings and then send out information to everyone else that there was a meeting.  Don't do that.\n\nThose are just the basics.  It's hard to get into anything concrete without knowing exactly what type of neighborhood it is.  The main gist is to figure out the impact of the options and err on the side of human.  People want to feel like they own their property, not that they're renting and can't do anything.",

Entire states have nearly every house in an HOA. North Carolina for example requires any neighborhood of over 20 homes have one, so pretty much every home is in one, and most of them do nothing but collect a small annual fee to upkeep storm basins and sidewalks.",

I've seen them as part of housing communities that are named and have some sort of sign at the entrance like \"Verdant Fields\" or something.  In that case, I'll add the qualification that my statements are for those sorts of communities and not the \"state requires an HOA\" neighborhoods.\n\nI'm part of today's lucky 10,000!",

They said they had a photo of a 'suspicious person' who had been 'obviously casing peoples houses to rob them' and included photos of my dad. The president of the HOA emailed back that they were \"very concerned after seeing the photos\" and would \"stop by her house to discuss the issue in person\". The scheduled a time to talk and come up with safety strategies.\n\nMy dad is the president of the HOA. \n\nHe said the look on her face when she opened the door was priceless. He then proceeded to discuss the 'issue' with her like she hadn't emailed a picture of him asking her \"Now why did you feel concerned for your safety?\" and \"What about him made you think this man was a threat?\"\n\nShe didn't send anymore complaints.\"\n\n",

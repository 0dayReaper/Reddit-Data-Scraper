    "postText": "Story from my Anonymous friend.  Bob worked for a small business owned by a micromanaging tightwad.  Because the owner was lax about attendance (*but only his own*), Bob and a couple of other coworkers had a complete set of keys - outside doors, storerooms, supply cabinets, tool crib, etc.  \n\nBob found a better job.  On his last day, the owner left mid-morning.  Not a big surprise, because the boss had started ignoring him as soon as he gave notice.  Bob had an inspiration and ran an errand at lunch. \n\nThe owner told Bob to leave his badge and keys in an envelope on the boss\u2019s desk.  Bob\u2019s errand?  Having  a **second** set of keys made. \n\nThe evil genius move?  He borrowed a coworker\u2019s set of keys and left both of his sets and his badge locked in the boss\u2019s office.  The boss will find the extra set of keys, realize Bob had them made, then realize Bob had to have another set to lock the boss\u2019s deadbolt.  Bob said it was worth the $20 to have the boss wonder if Bob had keys. He\u2019ll have to swallow his pride and call Bob, rekey the locks, or set up surveillance cameras.",

Just glad the boss didn't decide to skip right to calling the cops. Not that they would likely have been able to do anything, it still would have been a big hassle.",

That someone he had given keys to had returned them? \n\nIt\u2019s not *illegal* to make copies of keys you have unless they are specific government or patented keys that you cannot easily get the blanks for. Keeping a copy of those keys after you are no longer authorized *for the purpose of later burglary* might be a crime, but that\u2019s not what happened and there\u2019s no reasonable articulable suspicion that it happened.",

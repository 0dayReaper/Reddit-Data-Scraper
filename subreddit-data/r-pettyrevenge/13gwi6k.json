    "postText": "TLDR at end.\n\nThe neighbors backyard behind me butts up against my backyard. I have a 6 ft fence and we both have trees on either side of it so even in the winter there's a decent amount of screening between us.\n\n Imagine my surprise one day when my youngest daughter came in and said I suppose you know that the neighbors built a shed right up against the back fence right? I rushed out to the back deck and sure enough there was a 10x15 ugly ass shed literally a foot off of my fence. I called him up and said hey what's up with the new shed and he said he would come over and talk to me about it.\n\nOnce he came over I said man that things right on my property line and I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be 10 ft back. I asked him if If he could move it back so it wasn't so much \"in our face\" when we were sitting on our deck. He claimed because of the slope of his yard and a drainage ditch, that was the only place that it could be. I was also worried that if we ever sold our house and it was surveyed then it might become a big hassle. \n\nSo my neighbor offered to buy a piece of my property to make it right but only wanted to pay us $900. That's when my wife rolled on up from out of the house.\n\n She'd known the neighbor for a long time and thought he was an asshole allready to begin with. She immediately went for the throat. She told him that she needed a new refrigerator and the model she wanted cost $2,200 so that was the price for the land. Or She could just call zone enforcement to make him move it or start getting fined. Plus she told him that he was paying for the surveying and filing the property line adjustment. \n\nSo that's the story of how my neighbor bought my wife a brand new fancy refrigerator.\n\nTLDR; The neighbor built his shed that was supposed to be 10 ft from our property line right against our fence and my wife made him buy her a $2200 refrigerator In exchange for a property line adjustment.\n\nUpdate: thank you for the 1800+ post up votes (now over 4,000+)  and many comment upvotes. Thank you to all the trolls talking smack at least I got your attention right? People seem to be convinced that I sold the 96 ft\u00b2  for much less than market value. There's a .47 acre building lot for sale around the corner from me. It's on a really steep slope In the back like mine and has the same usable area as my .275 acre lot. Based on the sale price of that lot the square footage I sold my neighbor would be about $528. I sold it to him for $2,200",

The reason is because it affects the value of the property and can reduce the appraised value if the home too much for them to allow it. And all for a new fridge.",

Your neighbor lost $2200 and all that hassle he really didn\u2019t have to go through because he likely could have kept that shed where it was since it was on his property and not a permanent structure.  You lost a valuable asset like land and reduced the value of your land\u2026which was actually kinda funny because you were bragging about your wife\u2019s negotiating skills in one breath and stating you worried the visual of the shed would reduce your property value in the next breath.

That part is clear? You assessed it at 530 dollars based on some math with neighboring homes for sale. But did you account for the loss of value on your own home? It's at least 530 dollars by your math (which means the sale is worth 1060 now, with 10% appreciation per year becoming 2200 in like 7 or 8 years). But with a quarter acre lot, 96 sq ft would absolutely impact the market value by more than 530 dollars.  \n\nYou sold land for a pittance and had to look at an ugly shed.

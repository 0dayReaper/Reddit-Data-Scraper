    "postText": "Years ago I used to work as a pharmacy tech for a major retail pharmacy.  Occasionally, we'd have to deal with patients that also happen to be doctors who believe they deserve VIP status.  These are the kind of people that think that going to school for a long time means the should be held at a higher regard compared to others.  \n\nThis one particular doctor (we'll call him Dr. Smith)  came in one day and while ringing him up he balked at the price of the prescription.  Typically prescription copays were even dollar amounts but this was not.  Given that this was early in the year and the price was what it was I posited that he was seeing his insurance deductible being added into the copay price.  This was a typical issue we would see at the start of every year because many people don't know how their insurance plans work.\n\nHe insisted that it was not his deductible and the insurance must have not been billed.  I showed him the confirmation of insurance billing/approval and the price breakdown.  He wasn't having it.  Cue the following dialog:\n\n\"I'm sorry Mr. Smith.  If you want to call your insurance company to get more information you can but I can assure you the billing was performed correctly.\"\n\n\"That's DOCTOR Smith!\"\n\n\"You're not my doctor...\"\n\nA silence fell in the general vicinity.  Pills stopped being counted, bags stopped being packed.  I didn't break eye contact, his wavered.  I don't know how many times in his life he tried to pull that card on people in situations where being a doctor was completely irrelevant in order to assert some misguided sense of dominance, but he found out that day that it was all an illusion.  \n\nHe pulled out his credit card, paid, mumbled something unintelligible, and left visibly embarrassed.",

It was coined as an alternative to miss or Mrs. in the 17th century, believe it or not. But it didn't become widely used until the 20th century, more specifically in the '70s when feminist icons and Ms. magazine really popularized it. Honestly, I've always hated that women have to be defined by their marital status, and I have used Ms. my entire life, both when I was single and now that I am married. (I kept my last name, too, but that's another story...)",

At least in small cases like this. The bigger the actual threat from the charge sticking, they are more likely to tell the parent to go ahead and watch what happens.",

I know they\u2019re there based on conversations with others or meeting a few of their wives, but I couldn\u2019t point them out to you because they don\u2019t want people to know because of their efforts to not have a social hierarchy within the mosque.

We had a sticky note in his electronic chart reminding us. I looked him up and he wasn\u2019t even a medical doctor, he was a PhD, which I still think should be given their correct title BUT in a medical setting it can really muddy the waters if someone sees him and assumes he knows xyz because we\u2019re all calling him Dr SoAndSo. All the MDs and DOs I had as patients tried to keep it low key and would only bring it up when it was relevant.",

Basically, people who were calling their doctors about what they felt was near emergency issues. She (or anyone who worked there) was supposed to page the doctor and when the doctor called back to explain the situation. \n\nDoctors treated everyone like crap. Some made some of the girls cry on a nightly basis. \n\nThis was my sister's *second* job that she took just to make some extra money. She already had a very well paying job so -- she gave zero shits. When she would get a doctor like that she would hang up on them. When they would call back screaming she would tell them, \"Listen, the voices you hear on the other end of the phone are human. Stop screaming and yelling at them, they are only doing their job just like you are.\" LOL\n\nOne of the doctors was silent for a minute before he said, \"You know, no one has ever said that to me and I think I really needed to hear it.

There\u2019s this acquaintance I know that thinks they\u2019re some special hot shit or something, likes to show off and try to give the impression that they\u2019re a higher class citizen. The family is substantially well off and doesn\u2019t live in the real world. It\u2019s insufferable and I personally don\u2019t have time for them. Where I\u2019m based at now is the known armpit of the country; run down, all the industry has gone, and poor. This person has no qualms (and zero self-awareness or tact) about shoehorning into *any* conversation, repeatedly, that the house Daddy bought them is $1 mil, that they are throwing garden parties left and right, and were at so and so\u2019s exclusive dinner party. This area is known for shit beer, shit burgers, and is very working class. Hot Shit isn\u2019t even trying to fling around that they have money, just that they are completely better than you. You know, that type of person. \n\nAnyway, they have a friend (I know, remarkable). Doesn\u2019t refer to their friend by name or a \u2018my friend\u2019. Instead it\u2019s always: \u201cMy doctor friend and I did this,\u201d or \u201cMy doctor friend and I are going to this event.\u201d Recently: \u201cMy friend, the doctor\u2026\u201d You know, switching it up a bit for variety. Every time I come across this acquaintance I fantasize smashing their face through the nearest pane of glass and make them need that doctor friend\u2026 \n\nA while back, a few of us were discussing our weekend hi-jinks at coffee break, and along sidles Hot Shit. I\u2019m re-telling that we had a friend (let\u2019s call them CoolDude) stay over the weekend with us because we were going to a death metal show. It was a great weekend, but CoolDude had to leave early Sunday to catch a train to get back to work for a night shift.\n\nHot Shit (and snobby attitude): Oh, what does *your* friend do?\n\nMe: He\u2019s a surgeon. \n\nI\u2019m not even joking. CoolDude is a surgeon (and would never swing his skinny weight and long hair around insisting people call him doctor). Cue cat-butt mouth from Hot Shit, almost apoplectic that someone so lowly (me) has a learned friend and didn\u2019t swing it around like a status flag. \n\nMaybe don\u2019t be an insufferable c*** and use your friends/social circle to try and score \u2018better than you\u2019 points.",

But she had trained at that hospital so knew her way around, and thought that that made her much much better than the doctors. I did actually find a way to take her down a peg or three, which somewhat surprisingly got me well into the good books of the ward sister who was getting fed up with her!",

That's just to have health care coverage...\n\nThen, this this year so far I was in the hospital a week with covid pneumonia and my wife had a spinal stimulator implanted in her back. I had to shell out another $10,500 in deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses for both of us.\n\nA deductible is the amount of money you need to pay before your insurance begins to pay according to the terms of your policy. An out-of-pocket maximum refers to the cap, or limit, on the amount of money you have to pay for covered services per plan year before your insurance covers 100% of the cost of services.\n\nThat averages about $1,875/month for the year...sigh",

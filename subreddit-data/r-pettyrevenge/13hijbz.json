    "postText": "This happened years ago when I was in college.\n\nI was living in a dorm and most of the time I was alone there. Then they gave me two new roommates. Three girls in one room. They were older than me and I didn't like them.\n\nThey were loud, one of them kept smoking in the room and I ended up reporting her to the office for that. They kept shouting and not caring that I am studying or relaxing after whole day of classes. \n\nOne night they went out. I went to sleep and when they came out they turned the light on and started being loud again. Talking loudly, turned radio on and just didn't care that I was asleep. I told them to shut it because it was after midnight and I had early classes. They didn't for a very long time. \n\nWhen I woke up I had a plan. \nUsually when I wake up I go to the bathroom to do my make up and brush my teeth and do all the stuff. But this morning I took my CD player (yup, it happened long time ago) and turned music on. I had small speakers, but they were loud enough. \n\nOne of them asked me to turn it off and I just said no. She was counting on me going out to do my makeup and brush my teeth etc., but I set up a tiny mirror and I did everything in my room. I brushed my teeth on the way out. So for almost one hour I was banging the plates on the table, singing with the music,  talking to myself in my normal voice and then when I was leaving I shut the door really loudly.\n\nThey didn't talk to me for weeks and finally they moved out. I wasn't really happy with my way of dealing with things, but it also felt so good to get my revenge.",

Why should you give a shit when they are the ones who started it?? I hope you made them suffer like you did when THEY were being loud and annoying. I praise you for taking your revenge in the exact same manner as them. Karma is a bitch! \ud83d\udd25",

There were seven guys, college aged, and me, a woman in her early thirties (at the time). We never met. We never saw each others' waking faces! I was quiet as I could be when they were all asleep, and either they were as well, or my sleep was just that deep (it is not). Courteous behavior reaps rewards, like a better society: and sleep!\n\nOP, I'm glad you showed them the consequences of their actions.\n\n*I actually stayed there Thursday- Monday,  but the guys showed up Friday night.",

Weirdly, although there were bathrooms, there was also a long metal trough-like sink with maybe four or five taps. Very noisy when used, think water splashing on metal. \n\nOne morning, a group of young women, all late teens, had an early morning flight and were up at 4 am getting ready. Instead of going quietly into the bathroom to wash and dress, they chattered away to each other in the room where 20 or so other women were sleeping and decided to use the big metal sink and bang stuff against the side. Several people called out to them but they ignored it. They finally stopped when I got up and quietly told them to have more consideration - I think they listened to me because I was about 30 so enough older to make them feel they had to listen to me. No clue why people have to be so darn inconsiderate.",

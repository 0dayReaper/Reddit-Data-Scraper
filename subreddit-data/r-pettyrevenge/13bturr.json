    "postText": "This happened yesterday at work. I work in a small gourmet store in a high end area. So we have some entitled people. I work in the bakery/checkout section, with 2-3 other people depending on the day. When this happened there were three of us working, but one girl (CW2) was in the back. \nMy coworker (CW1) was helping this guy find a box of sesame seed cookies we sometimes have. We have a cookie shelf that is near the entrance that connects us to the other side of the store. She and the customer were standing five feet away from the actual entrance, so it had \u201copened up\u201d and there was about three to four feet on the other side of them for people to pass.\nEnter rude lady (RL).\nRL was carrying ~4 sandwiches, two of which were wraps in a container. Her hands were full, but she wasn\u2019t close to dropping everything. She didn\u2019t have a cane or anything, walked like I did.\nAnyway, she comes through the opening and CW1 and customer are \u201cin her way\u201d. They blocked a direct path but she could have easily gone around them to get to me. She would have to cross over to get to me anyway because of where the register is.\nInstead of taking advantage of the 3-4 feet that was wide open, this woman stops, sighs, and says \u201cseriously?\u201d\nIn shock CW1 and customer move out of her way but are giving her a hard side eye. I\u2019m honestly in shock as I\u2019m ringing her up but I\u2019m in customer service mode so I\u2019m smiling and being pleasant. She tells me the sandwiches she is buying are for a baseball team. When I asked, she said it was college rather than high school or little league. So it was probably her son on the team, as she only looks like she is in her lateish- fifties.\nThe exit is about ten feet away from the registers, and we face the door. So as this lady is walking out, I say to my coworker, loudly enough for her and others to hear\n\u201cshe\u2019s such a nice grandma, bringing her grandsons baseball team sandwiches.\u201d\nShe turns and looks at me, but I said it sincerely enough that she didn\u2019t want to call me out in front of other customers. She just walked after that.",

RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT MY AGE!\" like maybe an ID check?  I was young, I was always trying to appear older and more mature.  I was distracted, so I answered, \"Um.... 60?\"\n\nShe looked at me, \\*horrified\\* so I doubled down, \"Um, I'm sorry, 80?\"\n\nHer ID said 49. I still cringe at that memory.

My point was more from a place of being a person in that position, where at school functions, outside of the actual grandparents, were the oldest people in the room. As a person who could be vulnerable to that type of jab, I have to wonder why anyone would act in a manner so as to invite that type of response.\n\nMy parents owned a neighborhood grocery store when I was a kid. My mom taught me to always be cordial and cheerful, no matter how much the customers pissed me off, as it irritated them more to not get the rise they wanted. One of my parents employees would be so cheerful, he seemed at times to be deranged....it was really unnerving. But, what was a customer going to say? There are many different ways of dealing with shitty customers. You dealt with that lady the best anyone could. Hopefully some of her friends saw her.\n\nA lady that lived across the street from the store, named Geneva, would come in for collard greens. Every. Single. Time. She came in, she wanted a fresh box brought out of the cooler. I mean, I could have literally been opening up a new box as she came around the corner, and she would ask for a new box. Finally one day, I closed down the entire isle of the store, when I brought out 7 boxes, opened them all around her, just to make sure she found collards good enough for her. We finally made enough of a scene that embarrassment stopped her from doing it again.",

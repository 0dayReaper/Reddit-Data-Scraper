    "postText": "Friday night I came home from work to find someone on our block was having a large party and someone decided they were entitled to park in my driveway. \n\nKeep in mind my driveway is a single car width lined with a retaining wall on both sides and a garage at the end. Essentially impossible for a tow truck to come pull them out without property damage. \n\nSeeing this and the lack of street parking I took this as a cue to park right behind them in my driveway. Now a few hours go by and their entitled parker is now knocking at my door demanding I move my car so she can leave. Seeing as they were demanding, I informed them that I had been drinking and would not move my car. \n\nThe Entitled Parker then decides to call the police to get them to force me to move. When the police knocked on my door, I was sure to grab a beer from the fridge before I answered to talk to the officer. \n\nI had informed him that after I got home I was unwinding and had been drinking and was in no shape to drive. At this point their hands were tied because they couldn\u2019t tow her car out, I\u2019m in no shape to drive, and I\u2019m legally parked in my driveway. \n\n I ended up telling the Entitled Parker that since it is a long weekend I would be on a weekend long bender and they could come move my car after I go to work on Tuesday.",

He yelled after her, but she just acted like he didn't exist. And I guarantee if he had followed her, she would have called the cops and said a man was harassing her.",

Officer gets there and sees the bike sticking out of the water a couple feet in, (meaning the water ain't that deep) and helps the guy call a towing company to pull it out of the river. Once the company got called, the officer wanted to report back to the station but the dispatcher said \"no, that's alright, it's a pretty quiet day here, you can stick around and wait for the tow company\" the officer is then like \"really though, I could come back and do some paperwork, the company is on its way and this guy isn't going anywhere, I just feel like there's more I could be doing with my time\" and the other one is just like \"Naw sit tight\" they went back and forth with the officer begging to leave the area and I'm sitting there laughing my ass off in the car.",

They were going to a multi-day faire or something and the EF (Entitled father) thought he could use OP's driveway to avoid the parking nightmare AND score a primo spot about a minute's walk from the faire.\n\nOP asked him not to when they came back the first time; the EF just told him 'TS' and that he'd park here again.\n\nThe OP then backed his car out early the next day, and the EF took the bait and parked his car fully in OP's driveway. OP re-parked his car behind the EF's and proceeded to get nicely buzzed drunk and the same thing that happened in this post happened too; demanding OP move = cops called = officers couldn't do anything but in this one they asked OP if he could give the cop the car keys to move it. \n\nOP said no because he doesn't have third party insurance and has the right to refuse anyone else driving it. Cops were at a legal impasse with that.\n\nCops then told the EF there was nothing he could do. EF had a screaming hissy fit and the cops told him to calm down or be arrested for disturbing the peace. OP said he'd move it tomorrow.\n\nFamily had to find a last minute hotel stay. Next day, cops and EF were back, cops because they needed to breathalyse a known drinker before he got back in his car (yes the officer was messing with the EF a bit, he clued onto what OP did).\n\nOP was cleared, he moved the car, EF got a 'suggestion' from the officer to not park in any more driveways. The mom was looking daggers at her husband as he sheepishly got in to drive back home.",

People routinely park there. One time I came home and a lady is sideways in our lot taking up 3 spots. I looked at her and shook my head. She rolled down her window and yelled \"HEY DONT SHAKE YOUR HEAD AT ME!\" That just made me shake it even more at her and she got soooo pissed lmao. I was just like lady you're obviously in the wrong here fuck off. \n\nI deliver pizza and we have the same deal at work, signs marking our parking spots for delivery drivers only, and people park in them all the time. The owner of the place gave his blessing to us drivers to park directly behind these people and block them in. Even if they are customers. Even if you don't have another delivery for 3+ hours after. I love it. Fuck them dbags.\n\nAnd I do gotta say since I deliver pizza I do end up in some places I'm not supposed to park from time to time but I am highly respectful about it and deeply apologetic if anyone needed my spot in the 1-2 mins I'm there.",

A guy accross the street parked in one of the spots because the people who lived in my mom's house before her let him use one, and my mom never said anything to him when she moved in because she only had one car. Guy accross the street kept parking in the spot after I moved in even after we told him I was living there, so when I came home one night I decided to park right behind him and block him in. The next day was Monday, so of course he had to go to work, so I pretended not to hear him knocking on our door the next morning.",

But if it is ever out of your pocket, or someone else is reading this, they should know most CAA/AAA/etc. trucks can do a battery replacement in place, which is so much easier. I paid for the new battery of course, but the labour for the replacement was free (well, part of my annual subscription).\n\nAnd yes, 4-6 years is normal for a battery.\n\nEDIT: and the battery wasn't overpriced, in fact the CAA member rate was less than what CT was charging, before labour.",

Before we invested in collapsible parking bollards we would occasionally find someone in the space and have to park on the roadway, some distance away from our door. Really annoying.\n\nOnce day, I came home to find a car that I didn't recognise in my elderly neighbour's space.  I parked in my space and saw my neighbour arrive.  She was obviously really annoyed and, after checking with me that I was parked up for the night, she parked across the end of the three parking bays to get her car off the public roadway and onto our private property.  This prevented any  cars from leaving.  Two teenagers returned to the strange car some time later and tried a few doors to try to figure out who had blocked them in.  Once they were directed to my neighbour's door, my neighbour bluntly told them that she was having her evening meal and that they would have to wait until she was good and ready to move her car.  The two teenagers must have sat in their car just listening to the radio on a cold winter's evening for over an hour before my neighbour \"finished her meal\" and she chastised them into the bargain.  It was fun to watch.",

I'd walk over to the school occasionally with a list of makes and models and licence plates and tell them that these cars will be towed if they're not moved in the next 15 minutes, and to be fair to the school they'd inform people that there is no street parking on this road.\n\nIn 6 years we got about 8 cars towed, and who knows how many more had to drive around and *gasp* park farther away from the school in their MASSIVE parking lot or the road on the other side of the school that has dedicated street parking but is also even farther away from the school. I've had police called on me, verbal threats, even some racial slurs and stereotypes about going back home where I belong. That one was my favorite because I'd just say, \" Oh you mean the hospital that's 5 minutes from here? Or this neighborhood where I grew up? Or that school where I went for every grade K-5?

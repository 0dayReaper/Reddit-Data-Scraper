    "postText": "So my dear old mother has been my personal hell for as long as I remember. Starting from threatening to hit me with a bottle to trying to break down my door while screaming obscenities at me, to actually hitting me over the head with an umbrella and yelling at me when I cried (I was eleven btw).\n\nShe blamed me for my sister's divorce (I was six at the time it happened) for years, left for three months without a warning then acted entitled to my forgiveness when she came back.\n\n Thrown things at me, broke three TVs and called me a myriad of names ranging from mild things like useless waste of space to an actual curse/punishment.\n\nThe worst thing is she acts like she's the best mom in existence around other people. Complimenting me and stuff and I can't have a support system because no one would believe me when I say she's awful.\n\nBut I had an ace up my sleeve I kept for two years now. I secretly took videos and audios of every horrible moment and kept them in a safe folder. I had moments like the ones mentioned above and lots more of her talking shit about neighbors/ friends/ her own eldest child behind their back.\n\nTonight, I'm packing for uni. \n\nBy morning, the whole folder will reach multiple people, including my half siblings, aunts uncles, neighbors, her \"besties\" etc. \n\nBad luck, and worse day mother. You always said Justice is better served cold.",

I was kicked out of the house 2 weeks after I graduated high school unannounced and became homeless. Life's been fucked up ever since. I've accomplished way more then either one of my parents but have nothing to show for it. Without a support system you loose it all during the ups and downs.",

I ended up owing a bill for $500 for past due bills and unreturned equipment. 6 months later we're living together and I get a letter in the mail saying I owe $1000 to a credit card company and come to find out he signed me up for a credit card and made himself an authorized user and wrote bad checks to get more out of the credit limit. He had been screening the mail but I finally got one of the letters before he got to it. Luckily it wasn't higher because I had no credit yet. The only way I could get rid of it was to file a police report and send him to jail. My dad told me he would go to jail for a long time because he was a felon already and asked me not to do it so I didn't. My credit sucked for 7 years because of that because I refused to pay the bill. He's 43 now and just a year ago for off probation for the first time in his life since he was 16",

If you happen to have an account at the same bank as your mom, and she\u2019s on your account, start a new account somewhere else ASAP and move that money.    \nBanks have a thing called the \u201cright offset\u201c which means if person A has an account on their own, and person B has an account on their own, and they have a joint account where they are both owners and authorized users of another account together (like for example the custodial account parents often set up so their kids can deposit birthday checks or save up for college) if either person A or person B overdraws their own private individual account, the bank has the right to pull the money from the joint account.  If the joint account becomes overdrawn and either person has money in their individual account, the bank can pull money from the individual account.  What that means for you is if you are person B and mom is person A, and she overdraws her private personal account they cannot only pull money from the joint account to cover it, if the joint account becomes overdrawn they can pull money from your personal account to cover the joint account.  So mom can drain your account without even trying. And it\u2019s perfectly legal.  You may not even know what happened to you go to get your money up from one of the two accounts.  \nThis is why I always recommend if you\u2019re a part of a couple, one of you gets an account at Bank A by yourself. One of you gets an account at Bank B by yourself. You get a joint account at Bank C and you both transfer money into that account electronically from your other banks (or have your automatic payroll split deposit part of the money into your bank and part of your money into your joint account.",

We got into the habit of using his cell number instead of the name after that.

Don\u2019t let that woman keep living rent free in your subconscious. You deserve better! Material by Lisa Romano, Bren\u00e9 Brown, Dr Gabor Mat\u00e9, and Dr Ramani are all fantastic.",

The few times I was able to convince my mom to let me se her she got us in all sorts of trouble, nearly got arrested during one of her schemes.   \n\nI don't blame her, her mom really fked her up, but it got so bad my mom refused to let me see her at all for fear I'd end up dead or something.  \n\nEventually she got away from her mom and got married.  We reconnected years later and she told me she forgave me for what she considered me abandoning her ( I was 16 when I was forced to stop hanging out with her )\nWhen I tried to explain about how much in fear for my safety my mom was, she told me she hated my mom and blames her for keeping us apart.  Come to find out she had been basically cyber stalking me for years.  \n\nShe got really aggressive with me for a while, I had to change phone numbers. She harassed my family and eventually last year I had to tell her enough was enough. I told her I was sorry for the shit she had gone through with her mother but I couldn't bear the burden or the blame for any of it.\n\nSo sad how much damage a mother can do to her child.

Nor accept any contact overtures from any of my 3 surviving ancestors or their scumbag pals.\n\nHere is some advice:\n\nBe sure to take away all your cash &amp; bank info, photoid, childhood photos, all items of sentimental value, social security card and backup all the footage to an online service that is not connected to any account that your mother will be able to discover or access the password for.\n\nBuy a new phone and switch all your social media accounts to private.                                      Get an emergency untraceable prepay phone number and donate your old smartphone to charity or a homeless person.\n\nProtect your bank accounts and credit so that your mother cannot remove money from your accounts nor run up debts in your name.  Try to switch your bank statements to paperfree online only and redirect all your mail to a 24hr accessible mailbox facility that you will be able to visit once a month.\n\nApply for as many bursaries and financial awards as you are eligible for.\n\nWarn your uni that you have gone no contact &amp; all your info needs to be kept provate.  Appoint a close friend as your next of kin.\n\nHighlight the fact that you are permanently estranged and want no contact with your toxic mother &amp; she must never be granted any access to your accomodation or any academic/healthcare/contact info.\n\nThere is a chance that your mother may attempt to obtain contact information or access to you by using an alias and pretending to be someone else that you trust (e.g. your sister, a friend or their parent). If you suspect that this may have happened- trust your feelings and put your personal safety first.\n\nAbove all- trust your gut instinct and listen to what your common sense is telling you. Good luck with your studies and building the happy future life that you want!",

I went through that - people knew my whole life and not one person ever did anything to help me. Not one. That was devastating. Consider the possibility that people might still say that they do not believe you. These people might be in denial for any number of reasons but yeah, that's difficult too. People might be angry at *you* instead of your abuser. It's tough no matter what.\n\n\n\nI fully endorse torching all the bridges having done it myself (and my life is so much better for it) but yeah, consider the social and emotion outcomes too.

Allowed my mentally disabled brother to sexually abuse the boys and my younger sister. Any time I tried to speak up, I was blamed and called a liar. I was sent to scared straight program, constantly drug tested, beaten by step dad for spreading lies. the young boys were too scared to say anything. For a few weeks I recorded a few sound files and videos on the family computer. I packed a bag and left one night. Walked 2 miles to a teacher's house, told my story and gave everything to the police. FF a year or so later, my mom got a few months probation, my younger brother got 50 something years in prison for assaulting a neighbor(17 felonies in 1 night) That was 20 years ago. I plan to do a full story here at some point. You did good. I wish I didn't wait as long, maybe my brother could have gotten help. the boys that were abused may be better off. Both my sisters hate me for ruining the family and still very close to my mom last I heard. I have had no contact with anyone in many many years. It sucks having nothing during the holidays but I know I did right, and all I could do at the time. I Hope you don't let those scares fester and alienate you like I have. I feel my biggest regret was not doing more sooner, or making sure things actually changed for the ones I left behind. Don't expect much to happen, my experience has shown people don't change. Hell my step dad is still with my mom to this day. Even after the boys grew up and told him everything, he is still with her.",

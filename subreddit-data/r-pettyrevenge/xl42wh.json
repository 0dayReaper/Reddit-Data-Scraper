    "postText": "So back in June, I left a very toxic workplace of 8 years. I mainly left due to having a break-down from being overworked. But this one particular person made working there even worse on-top of the excessive work.\n\nThis guy was 1 year younger than me. He was a 30 year old man, the type of guy that appears to have peaked in secondary school, very jock-like mentality and childish too. He was part of my team of 4. I was civil with him just because I had to work with him but he WAS my workplace bully.\n\nApart from just the general \"workplace banter\", this guy (lets call him Chris) was relentless with his teasing. What would usually be classed as 'playful' always pushed to bullying from him because he never knew when to quit. And if he noticed you were getting stressed or annoyed. He'd use you as a target of his teasing for the rest of the day. He would be super nice to you when it's just the two of you, but as soon as he has an audience, he picks his 'victim' and will tease them constantly in what he would call \"playful\". And if you ever got annoyed and stood up for yourself, he'd say hes \"only messing\" and make out like hes the victim. He's that type of person.\n\nOne specific thing that he absolutely lost any respect I had for him was when I was STILL working there, some ex-employee wrote a very aggressive and angry review on glassdoor about the company. Just because this person used a phrase that I use, Chris thought the review was me... As much as I proved that it wasn't me (didn't even have a glassdoor account at the time). He was relentless with campaigning around the office that I was the one that wrote it. I also believe he told the boss that I was the one that wrote it once I left and thats why I didn't get any freelance work from them afterwards.\n\nSo after I left my workplace, my old team still have a group whatsapp that I'm a part of and we still talk almost every other day on it. After I left the group chat went a bit quiet, I assumed they made a new one of just them which is fair. But the chat still kept going occasionally. I unfollowed and unfriended Chris on facebook and instagram because I just didn't want to be associated with him anymore.\n\nIn the middle of the group chat. He broadcasts \"Why did you unfollow and unfriend me on facebook?\" whilst also @ ing me. He wrote this message at 6:30am. I woke up to this message broadcasted in the group chat... It pissed me off. So I was honest and said that he's a bully and instead of making a big thing of it, i'd rather just remove him from the equation. I also said that it was immature of him to do this over the group chat and not in private.\n\nHe didn't say anything, he just left the group chat and blocked me on everything. The group chat pretty much died after that. I was at the time, ***livid***. This 30 year old man set fire to the group chat, saw what I said and then ran off... I thought it must be a blessing in disguise because I finally got to say what I wanted to him and I now don't have to acknowledge him again....\n\nBUT I WAS WRONG.\n\nSkip to 3 months later, me and my husband walking through town and stopping off at a pub to get some grub... And low and behold. I see Chris there with a new girl I hadn't seen before. I was feeling extra-confident and decided to approach.\n\nI went and said \"Hey Chris, long time no see!\" with a big grin on my face, Chris looking like a deer in headlights, the perfect kind of red cheeks. I asked him \"How are things, you doing well?\" and he replied in a very normal way, clearly not wanting the conversation to continue and looking awkward as fuck in front of his new girl.\n\nShe asked how we knew each other. I generously waited for Chris to say \"We used to work together\". So I added onto that \"Yeah, its quite funny really, Chris used to be my workplace bully, he's the reason why I struggled financially after I left my old job because he accused me of writing a hostile review to the company which I proved I didn't do and lost me a lot of freelance work because of it\".\n\nHe was gobsmacked. Face redder than a traffic light. The new girl clearly looking confused and uncomfortable. Neither of them responded. I didn't want it to carry on much longer as it wasn't really fair on her. But just to add salt to the wound I said \"So is this your new girlfriend Kathrine? Or is this Georgia? What happened with Sarah since someone said you were still with her last week?\" (all of those are completely true, he gets around). This girl goes from confused, to angry in the blink of an eye and just stares at Chris.\n\nI just say \"Oh whoops, I really put my foot in my mouth haven't I, I better go, it was nice seeing you again Chris.\" and walk of.\n\nMy husband whilst he felt bad for the girl (which I did too, but tbf, I might have saved her from inevitably being dumped by him a few weeks later when he gets bored of her) was very proud that I finally got my \"closure revenge\" on him.\n\nIt feels amazing. Like I feel petty as fuck, but it felt good for there to finally be some consequences to this Chris guy being a dick.\n\nEDIT: Wow, this blew the hell up. Thank 99% of you for the lovely comments. I loved a few of your stories too about your petty revenge. Naturally theres the 1% who just don't believe anything that they read on the internet and that is fair. A lot of the internet is bullshit. But this story is 100% from myself. You can check my post history if you must. I've talked about this toxic workplace before.",

She knew I was a young mom and kept bullying saying I have no choice. Peace out bitch, I quit. Cut to 7 years later she comes to interview at my new professional job. She saw me and all the color drained from her face. Interviewer said \"oh you guys know each other?\". She tried to be my best friend. When she left, interviewer came to me and asked if she was a good employee? I told her what happened.  She didn't get the job. Fuck you Christy, you deserved it!",

The husband, now being a very busy man is always working. The nurses notice the wife is entering labour early, but unfortunately the husband is away on a business trip! So with none of the immediate family around they reach out to the only listed contact, one of their brothers.\n\nStill in a coma, the wife eventually gives birth and would you look at that, it\u2019s twins! But the husband is still far away despite his best efforts to get back on time, so the hospital staff ask the brother to name the babies. So he looks at the girl and says \u2018Denice\u2019. \nThinking to herself that it\u2019s a nice, respectable name, the nurse jots it down. \nThen the brother looks at the boy and says \u2018De-nephew\u2019\n\nI\u2019m sure it not 100% right but that\u2019s about as close as i can remember haha",

I too had a break down of sorts however I already had been dealing with anxiety and depression as a Service Disabled Veteran. I also was dealing with a newly diagnosed autoimmune disorder that greatly impacted my work output as far as amount in time period and my Cognitive Abilities had been lessened due to medication side effects. I ended up leaving my job of 12 years as mutually agreed on by myself and then employer. \n\nThey ended up trying to shift me by not processing Medical Retirement paperwork as stated and agreed upon. I had to hire a lawyer ($6k) and it took two years to finally be rectified it worked out in my favor (thank the lord). That backpay check was super sweet but the two years of little income left its mark.\n\nMy bully ended up taking a position overseas n9t long after I left. He tried to bully someone else after I left and I she called me for advice. I coached her on how to battle it and she was the Victor. The entire office found out how big an a-hole he really was. I may have not been in the right mind frame to fight for myself but coaching her was therapeutic. Plus I had done loads of research on employee rights, discrimination, the laws covering such things, filing complaints, Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) Office responsibilities, etc. So I had the knowledge she needed. By the time I got my self esteem and self worth back to where it belonged my former bully was long gone. \n\nBut he'll be back as he owns a home here and this is where his wife wants to retire. I truly believe we'll meet again and when we do there will be nothing held back or allowed to get in my way. My spouse already knows if he ever gets a call regarding bail for me (worst case scenario) he'll know the Bully crossed my path. I don't know about your significant other but it took an almost act of God equivalent to keep mine from throwing caution to the wind and simply unleashing on my bully. If we hadn't had kids relying on us I'm pretty sure nothing would have stopped him.\n\nSo again congrats as I can truly imagine (as I have many times) how good it felt to close that wound. To anyone that gave you grief...forget them! It's easy to say someone is wrong without having ever walked in their or like shoes. And if they have walked in any of those shoes but took the \"high road\" so to say...well good for them. But I'm not them...I'm just me....just as you are you. We know what we can't or can do but we are not lesser of a person by any means.\n\n I guarantee we have taken the high road in circumstances where others have taken the low road. It all works out in the end IMHO. One a personal note, for me, I answer to one person and one higher power...my spouse ( we have built life together he's due and vice versa) and My God. Everyone is else utterly inconsequential to me. Truth!",

He turned beetroot red and had nothing to say to defend himself as he knew he was a prick and a bully. Wherever you are now kev thank you \ud83d\ude4f",

This gives me vibes that yall used to date and you broke up with him to be with your now husband, and yall coincidentally ended up at the same job. \n\n&gt;I said \"So is this your new girlfriend Kathrine? Or is this Georgia? What happened with Sarah since someone said you were still with her last week?\" (all of those are completely true, he gets around).\n\nHow do you know this? What happened to him blocking you and you unfollowing him? It's been 3months since you've lasted seen him how do you still know what he's up to?\n\n&gt; Like I feel petty as fuck, but it felt good for there to finally be some consequences to this Chris guy being a dick.\n\nYou in this case was not being 'petty asf' but stalkery as shit. Though it is good Chris had consequences to his actions it's not like he can't find another girl......I just feel like this is a fake post \ud83d\ude12Also by you saying red in the face when he saw you it's like he was nervous but nervous about what he taunted you throughout your time working together. Why would he be nervous now? Yes, he may be infront of a girl he likes but OP said he changes girls every week",

But seeing him IRL, I just went on auto-pilot towards him. I guess I felt like I needed my closure and to be sure he understood that he was a bully. I'm a 31 year old guy with no fear of my job getting in the way of being honest with him now that I left that place.\n\nI am still friends with a good 8 or 9 people in the office. The office is only 20 people, it was a small company. They tell me the gossip, about Chris and about everything else.\n\nHow was I a stalker when I happened to walk into the same pub he was in? \n\nYou can think its fake, I honestly don't care, I know what happened and I know how he made me feel for the 8 years I worked there. \n\nHe was red in the face because he saw someone that called him a bully and he blocked????? whilst he was on a date???? Like imagine seeing someone you really don't want to see walk into a place that you are and sees you. Yeah. I think you'd go a bit red too. Maybe he hadnt \"conquered\" this girl yet. I don't know and I honestly do not care lol. I got my final bit of revenge on him that felt very poetic.",

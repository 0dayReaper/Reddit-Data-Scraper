    "postText": "I was going to post this on JustNoMIL but feel like it fits better here. \n\nMIL has always been bitter that \u201cI took her son away from her\u201d. She\u2019s the queen of negging and I am often her number one target. She loves to make me jealous- sends pictures of her new cars, sends pictures of her new house, sends pictures of her designer handbags etc saying \u201cisn\u2019t it great I can afford all this\u201d. \n\nMIL didn\u2019t invite us on vacation last summer. She invited and paid for her other son, his gf AND the gf\u2019s sister to go. She bought them designer souvenirs and sent us pictures every day of their vacation captioned \u201cI bet you\u2019re so jealous\u201d.\n\nNot 3 months after she excluded us from her vacation, my parents invited us on their vacation. We accepted.\n\nMIL was FURIOUS. Jealousy is not a good look on her. She threw a tantrum saying that she was losing her little boy and that she \u201cwanted to be the best mom in the world\u201d. She was so jealous that my mother is getting more attention than her. She cried about how she never sees us and how we\u2019ve always \u201cshown blatant favouritism\u201d towards my parents. \n\nThe best bit of all this - it was at this moment SO decided to tell her that we are moving 5 hours away\u2026to my parent\u2019s city.",

If you allow them to have any part of your life, including even thinking about them, they are winning.  \n\nOne thing I encourage you to think about is if you keep trying to make your MIL jealous you are being no different than your MIL.  Your husband has seemingly cut off his mother, so don't become like her and gloat about \"winning\" her son.  It really does make you be at the same level as her.  Be better than her.  Be the woman that her son chose.  Most importantly, live the life that you and your husband want and don't worry about if it makes anybody jealous.  \n\nSeriously, don't play her game, it  makes you look like you want what she has.",

There\u2019s nothing you could do to change her ways of thinking but putting that distance (physical and emotional) there will improve your life so much. \nI\u2019m so happy for you OP and I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t stoop to her level because it would\u2019ve been just as ugly and unhappy as when she does it.

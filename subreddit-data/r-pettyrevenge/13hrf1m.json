    "postText": "So i live with my cousins my aunt and uncle and ofc my mom and sister but their not relevant to the story. Anyways my cousin\u2019s tv broke so hes been using the living room tv to play games, unfortunately my room shares a wall with the living room as the wall behind my bed (where i spend most of my time) is literally the same wall the tv is in front of. My cousin is a sore loser with an anger problem so whenever he loses (which is often) he screams obscenities out he shouts and cusses out his teammates or just bitches to himself, unfortunately i have to hear all of this I confront him two times and he tells me to put my headphones in or do something else. One night my friends and i are on call and we talk and talk i have a big laugh and can be a little loud with my reactions but i wasn\u2019t screaming. I do this again the next night and he bursts through the door to complain about my noise level I call out his hypocrisy but he says its different im fed up so i told him id match his level, he gets into a rage once more and i snapped so i put my tv volume on 100 and listen to music while reading or playing Minecraft i did this for 4 hours plus i have a very different music taste to him so he got to listen to lady gaga, charli xcx, sophie, lana del rey, 100 gecs, SEBii, and much more granted not all of it was electric music but enough metal on metal action went on in the beats. Apparently he couldn\u2019t  hear his teammates and lost (what changed??? Thats unheard of!) he got the message. I told myself that whenever he gets into those fits ill do it again I\u2019ve done this 3 times now and it seems to be working.\n\n(English is my second language so please forgive my bad grammar)",

            "comment": "I remember my mom's upstairs neighbor was horribly noisy. He'd come home in the middle of the night and scream or stomp, and he'd blare his country music with a subwoofer on the floor directly above us starting at 7-8 am. You couldn't sit in another room or outside to get away from it because it was that loud, and you could feel the bass so just putting headphones in wasn't an option. I was in online school at the time so it was super annoying. The landlord didn't do anything when neighbors complained.\n\nI got fed up one day and decided to blare 100 gecs on my laptop with a horrid bass boost and put my laptop right under the ceiling, where the music was coming from. I made sure to choose tracks I know would be annoying like gec 2 \u00dc. He started stomping where the music was coming from, which was funny because he was doing the exact same thing I was except even louder because my laptop can't get that loud, even with a bass boost. 100 gecs torture seems to be great with getting points across.",

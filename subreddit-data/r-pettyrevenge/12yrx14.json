    "postText": "This story is undoubtedly the first time that I remember being petty simply for the sake of revenge.\n\nI was about 6 years old at the time and my brother was 10. We had both recently bought our first cap guns and we were elated, but our mother had one very strict rule, no firing them off inside the house. Mine was a nice Beretta 9mm Police Special lookalike while my brother sprung for a red 8-shot revolver. He loved that gun. He was always playing with it and at night before bed, he would stash it away in his bedroom so when he got into bed he could pull it out and pretend to shoot things without any caps in it. \n\nOne day a few months after getting the cap guns my brother did something so irrepressibly horrible that to this day I am still unable to recall exactly what it was he did. All I know is that I needed to take revenge and that I knew exactly what I could do to get him in trouble while keeping my hands clean of any wrongdoing. That night after I knew he had stashed his revolver away for the night I snuck into his room and loaded the toy gun with a cartridge of caps that I had pilfered earlier in the day. Then I waited. It didn't take long and about 10 minutes after we went to bed it happened. My unsuspecting brother pulled out the revolver, aimed it at some imaginary enemy, and pulled the trigger. BANG! What happened next I'll never forget. My parents furious scurry to my brother's bedroom and his pleas of innocence will forever be etched into my memory.\n\nTL:DR My brother and I were forbidden from firing our cap guns inside the house so one night I loaded his without him knowing.",

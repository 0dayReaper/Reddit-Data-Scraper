    "postText": "This was some years ago, but when I lived in the burbs, there was this 25 year old guy that hung out with kids still in high school and would drive by every day with a massive lifted truck yelling profanities at us. We didn\u2019t personally know him, just that type of guy.\n\nOne day, he threw his soda at us driving by, and we had enough. My friends and I had bought a giant dildo as a prank months ago, and decided to super glue it to the back of his truck.\n\nCome to find out, he was dating two girls (one was mid twenties and had a kid with him, one was our age in high school, 18).\n\nFor a week, he didn\u2019t notice the dildo and he would drive by with it flailing around on the back of his truck (he also had the hanging balls on his truck which was even more hilarious). Back then, Facebook was the thing, and when he found out, he accused the 18 year old girl of doing it.\n\nThe 18 year old girl publicly posted that her ridiculous boyfriend accused her of putting her dildo on the back of his truck, and the mid twenties girl saw it and put two and two together (realized he was cheating). They both ended up breaking up with him, and the girl in her mid twenties posted a picture with the dildo on the back for everyone to see.\n\nTo this day, he\u2019s still single from what I can tell, and never knew it was us. Not that great of a revenge story, but who would have thought.\n\n\u2014\n\nTo clarify, the guy lived up the street from us, and I was friends with the 18 year old girl on Facebook. She went to the same high school as me. That\u2019s how I saw it all go down.\n\nThe dildo had suction on the back of it, so it\u2019s meant to stick to surfaces or walls. Not sure if it was super glue or gorilla glue, but whatever it was, we held it on for a few minutes and it stayed.",

He was also fill of macho bullshit \"no poofters\" rhetoric. We worked salvage and one time a heap of unsold sex toys were in a load. We got the latex bum and glued it to the back of his ute (pickup) and put a man love sticker next to the quivering butt. He liked to reverse into parking spaces so did not see it for a while. He drove around the small city for a few days before anyone told him. He was known for his opinions so the joke was on him at his expense.  Every time a story filtered back we laughed so hard.... Once the guy found out we doubled up on the sighting stories. Had gay mates ask him if he had changed his attitude. Was not so much bullying him as using his prejudice against him.  Really took the bloke down a peg.",

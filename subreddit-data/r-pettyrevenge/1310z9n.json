    "postText": "Years ago when the wifey and I were living in our first apartment together, our upstairs neighbor had a stupidly loud surround sound system. \n\nWhile this really wasn\u2019t much of an issue at all, there came a day where I had enough.\n\nI was stuck at home, with bronchitis and a double ear infection. (And before you ask, yes, dude upstairs knew it. Our kids were besties.) Skyfall came out on DVD that morning, and homeboy must\u2019ve picked it up at Best Buy the moment they opened, because he fired that shit up so loudly, I could clearly hear every lyric from the opening number through the floor.\n\nWhile running a 100-degree fever and generally feeling like hammered shit, I hatched my plan for revenge. \n\nI let him finish the movie, unbothered. All while dragging my Marshall Half-stack amplifier into the living room, and laying it flat on the coffee table, pointed at the ceiling. \n\nI then proceeded to play through Metallicas first three albums back to back on my guitar, at full blast. \n\nDude came by the next day with chicken soup and an apology. \n\nNever had an issue again.",

Apparently a lot of people from our building, and other buildings facing the courtyard decided to have a get together. Good for them. The problem was the neighbor I shared a wall with wanted to be the DJ, and had his shit turned all the way up. Our building was built in the 60s, and had hardwood floors. It conducted sounds/vibrations VERY well. \n\nI was home and had nowhere to be that day, and was rightfully annoyed. So, I did what any college student with a very expensive stereo system would do: fight back. I put on whatever metal bands I was following at the time. I'm sure there was Metallica, Slipknot, and Children of Bodom on the playlist. I had earplugs in, and every few songs I would pause to check to see if the neighbors' music was still playing. Wash, rinse, repeat until they figured out mine was louder.",

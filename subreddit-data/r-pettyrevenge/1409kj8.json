    "postText": "I'm a student at an art uni and we were given a group project (teams of 4), the task was to make visual effects for a dance act, fair enough. Problem was that out of 4 people only me and let's call her Judy actually worked on the project. The teacher was strict and she didn't knew what she wanted out of us, that meant a lot of visual changes and work in general, done by me and Judy entirely. The grade was the same for all in the team, all that mattered was the quality of the end project. Towards the end me and Judy decided to give some small tasks to \"Kevin\" and \"Ashley\" (other 2 members) just so we could say that they helped and they would also pass the subject. Mind you, this project was meant to replace the exam. In the final week before the the deadline Kevin had decided he had enough (after not doing anything) and went back to his hometown. Ashley failed the small task miserably and didn't contribute to anything in the end. Fast forward to the end of the uni semester and the teacher knew that there were slackers in each team. Now I didn't plan to snitch on my colleagues (you do you it's fine by me) but the teacher proposed a new exam for all of us if we wouldn't tell her who actually worked the project and who didn't. If we would tell her she would give the new exam only to the slackers, and I snitched. With countless other exams this was the last thing I wanted because of someone's laziness. Now while I'm happy that karmic justice has fallen upon Kevin, I'm also seen as a snitch.",

It's an attempt (that has become successful and self perpetuating) by bullies to get away with not following the rules, not doing the work, and quite often just breaking the law! It is someone saying \"I do not want to be held accountable for my actions, even though they have negative consequences for others.\" \"I don't want my victims to gain any justice, and I don't want to be punished for victimising others.\" And people are happy to let this happen? People even stand by those doing wrong (or in this case doing nothing when they should be doing something, making others work harder)?! It astounds me that so many go along with this as if they've been brainwashed into thinking completely the opposite to how a civilised, just and fair society needs to run! Hell, no. You're NTA.",

And secondly uni is free in my country for about the first half of the class, so we do compete with each other for those spots. But even if you have to pay it's only about 1000$ per year, so you can easily make that by working if your parents can't support you.",

Just being honest and doing your role.\nIn college I lead a group project (think final class for my major before graduation for about 1/2 the folks on the team).  There were 7 of us on the team.  Three of us did 60% of the project, another person 15%, the other 4 bare minimum.  One tried but was ineffective\u2026\nPart of my role was being honest with the professor and grading the others.  Mind you, everyone got to have similar input but my comments carried the most weight.  How do I know?  Because their final grades were exactly what I suggested.  No one got lower than a C, but amazingly the 3 who did so little were still shocked to get a C.  \nYou get out of it what you put into it.  All things in life.

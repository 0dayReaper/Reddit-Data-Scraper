    "postText": "Sorry for the length and nsfw just at the end for language. \n\n\nSo this happened a few years ago, a quick set up first..\n\nEvery year we have a family event in Ohio in August. It\u2019s in a small town with a big county fair around that time. My dad grew up in that town and my parents actually met at the fair, they both have family there even though my mom didn\u2019t grow up there. So needless to say, it\u2019s been kind of tradition to go every year even though we live in Wisconsin now\u2026plus the fair is fun. \n\nThey were staying at my aunt and uncles house 20 minutes out of town and I was to stay and my dads high school buddies house a block from the fair grounds. Since I wanted a mode of transportation while I was there, I bought a motorcycle trailer and we trailered my Ducati down.\n\nNow comes the conflict..\n\nWe stopped at a gas station/truck stop I think in Indiana, my dad pulled his truck and my trailer best he could out of the way so trucks could easily get in and out and we were getting ready to head in for snacks/bathroom break, when a tractor trailer pulled in, went to spin around to back into a spot and stopped his truck right at the front bumper of our truck. Dude was fuming, couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying at first because he was in his truck. He eventually backed in and got out of the truck and approached our vehicle. Swearing, yelling, dropping f bombs left and right about how my dad didn\u2019t know how to park, calling him every word in the book, and that my dad is in the way and how he couldn\u2019t back in right because he didn\u2019t have enough room to pull up. You know, nice guy. My dad pointed to the half a dozen plus open truck stalls just a few stalls down from where he eventually parked where my dads truck wouldn\u2019t be remotely in the way then, but I guess dude just had to park in that particular stall. I chimed in and said that \u201cIf he\u2019s to inept as a truck driver to back into a spot, I would be more than happy to show him how it\u2019s done\u201d, seeing as I have a class a cdl and back hundreds of trailers a week in my current spotter job. Well, he wasn\u2019t too happy about that but it got him to walk away back to his truck. \n\nNow the revenge..\n\nWe finished everything up and was getting ready to head out. The truck driver finally walked into the gas station a couple minutes before we walked out and I heard him under his breath still cursing out my dad calling him obscenities and giving him the death glare so before I walked back to our truck, I walked over to his truck and pulled his fifth wheel. \n\nFuck that guy.\n\nEdit\nSince many don\u2019t know what pulling the fifth wheel means, pulling the fifth wheel means to pull the handle that is located on the side of most trucks by the fifth wheel which uncouples the truck from the trailer. It\u2019s honestly a real dick move because if you don\u2019t do your inspection before you drive off and catch it, you can drop your trailer. Dropping your trailer is a big no-no and can easily get you fired.",

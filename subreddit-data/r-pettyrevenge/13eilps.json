    "postText": "I worked as a mechanic in the Air force for 9 years but it took until year 3 before I finally convinced command to send me to get licenses to drive the vehicles I had been working on ( just military things!). The driving courses are a 10 day long Army run event so i ended up at an army base, mid winter, with a driving instructor that hated the Air force, taking every chance he could to smack talk me. A bit of fun rivalry is to be expected but this was something else.\n\nFirst day on the course he singles me out saying \"As you can see we have a chairforce lad here and he turns out to be a mechanic!\" Sarcastically saying afterwards \"make sure to be careful with your rigs so he won't have to fix them for you!\". First 2 days days he rides my ass to look at small things he deemed 'critical', forcing me to crawl around in the mud and snow. I was supposed to be there to get my licenses and not be a mechanic.\n\nJump to day 3 when I get a call on the radio asking me to have a look at the instructors vehicle.He says \"Chairforce! Get yourself here I have a coolant leak in the cab. Let's see if they teach you anything other than how to drink coffee and stand around\". No problem sergeant, on the way.\n\nUsing the onboard tools I take a look at the vehicle. I notice a split heater core hose dripping into the vehicle. For reference the heater core turns hot coolant into heat for the cabin and it's snowing outside. Knowing full well I could shorten the hose and it would be fine, I chose to disable the heater core completely, telling him \" Sorry SGT the heater is busted and I can't allow the coolant to leak so I had to disable it.\" He was absolutely fuming.\n\nHe spent the next week driving around in his ice cold vehicle looking absolutely miserable, Taking every moment to complain about the cold and the 'shit Air force mechanic'.\n\nI just laughed from the comfort of my warm truck.",

My driving course consisted of my sergeant pointing and saying, \u201cgas, brakes, steering wheel, any questions?\u201d \n\nI was also stationed on an Air Force base for advanced training. Was put on a very long administrative hold. The Army had so many people on hold, they loaned us out to the Air Force.  I was permanently loaned to the pharmacy. Every day instead of going to Army detail, I went to the hospital pharmacy. After a couple weeks, AF sergeant asks me if I have driver\u2019s license. Then tosses me the keys to the AF truck and tells me to go pick supplies up in town. Kind of wish they had forgotten about me and left me in that pharmacy.",

With 10 years of reservist training each lasting 2 weeks. \n\nSpend like an entire year doing my boot camp and my driving course one after another.    \n\nSpent most of the time in driving course just waiting.  Incompetency by driving instructor contractors company   Resulting in less manpower than required.  Before me dudes spent like 8 months.  \n\nMeanwhile if you got warrant officer and higher in your class going for training.   Thing wraps up in freaking in 3 -2 months.   They skip us over to train them",

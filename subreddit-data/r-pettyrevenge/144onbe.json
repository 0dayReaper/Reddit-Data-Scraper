    "postText": "So back in my university days I was in the UOTC Pipes (bagpipes) and Drums (probably similar to the ROTC). We normally had a big Mess dinner at camp.  \n\nFor those unaware, there's a general rule that you don't leave the tables until the guest of honour does, which includes going to the toilet.  \n\nSo we're knocking back the wine during the meal and the seal starts to strain a bit. Empty wine bottles begin to disappear off the table, discretely moved under our kilts and...refilled \ud83d\ude06 Then placed on the floor under the table to be disposed of when we're free to leave.  \n\nWe've a few bottles of wine left in our area when this future Rupert saunters over and grabs one. \"Doesn't look like you'll miss this, lads.\" Oh really.  \n\nWe're now out of wine and over the next while I see the prick do something similar to another table. A few of us exchange a look and a couple of our piss-filled bottles return to the table. Sure enough, Rupert eventually returns and swipes one.  \n\nWe were allowed to leave shortly afterwards, so legged it out of there, but I often think of him refilling a few of his mates glasses with our second hand wine.\n\nETA: British army officers are referred to as Ruperts by the other ranks.",

I bought his drinks when times were tough, but he got entitled to my personal drinks and would swipe my shots and beers right out of my hand. \n\nI drank a beer and a shot, and began the set up. Had a friend fill up an empty bottle and leave it on the bar. He walked in, grabbed the shot of jack and the beer, and chugged both.\n\nThe look on his face as he came to realize it was warm... and then realized it wasn't beer, was priceless. He complained to the manager, they checked the cameras and my friend got fired sadly. But the payback was glorious! \n\nCheers to your second hand drinker!",

The line for some home comforts (like orange juice) from the American PX might be an hour. So you got invested. \n\nThe fridge was located in a common area just outside the headquarters. My mate noticed his orange juice kept going missing. We were very junior so the seniors tended to ignore us. Eventually my buddy got jack of the situation and stopped drinking water for a day. Then smashed a few litres of water and \"topped up\" the juice in the fridge. And sat and waited. \n\nTurns out the fucking CO walks out of the HQ, strolls over to the fridge, takes a deep swig of the OJ, realised its not right, screws up his face, puts it back and scurries back into the headquarters.  \n\nMy mate runs into my tent where I'm resting and grabs me by the shirt and shakes me muttering \"the CO drank my piss, the CO drank my piss....\" \n\nHands down the funniest thing that happened to me on that tour!",

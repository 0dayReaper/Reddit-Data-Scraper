She was very abusive my whole life.. she used to cuss up enough to make a sailor blush. One day she was in a extra foul mood and  she called me a Son of a Bitch\u2026.. I saw my cue and  decided I was going for gold and stated \u201c you know what Mom, you are Right\u2026. I am\u201d as her jaw hit the flooring I  walked away. After that she watched very carefully what she called me. And she was a less angry person. I learned not to let what she said bother me.",

She tried to guilt me for calling him that by saying, \"when you call him that your calling me a bitch!\" She liked my dead ass \"Duh\" stare at her less than the actual insult I threw at my brother.",

    "postText": "When I was in fifth grade, decades ago, I was apparently being too loud in the lunchroom.  Mr. C, my teacher, had lunch duty that day and decided he'd make an example out of me.  He had me come to the middle of the gym (doubled as our lunch room) and made me lie down on my back in front of grades 4 - 6.  Then he told me to lift my legs and arms straight up.  When I did, he pointed at me, laughed and said to the now-hushed assembly, \"Look, a dead cockroach!\"  It got a terrific response and I was embarrassed.  But not as embarrassed as I was pissed.  I sulked off angrily to a roar of laughter.\n\nSo what did I do?  I did the mature thing; I told on Mr. C.  To who?  My dad.  Well, you gotta know my dad to appreciate what I knew was going to befall the hapless Mr. C.  My dad owned a sawmill but also taught industrial arts within the same school system, which meant he well knew the School Board, principals, etc.  The other thing about my dad is he used to be, when he was younger, a pretty violent and loud guy.  Normally, funny and nice but when provoked turned into Mr. Hyde.  He's not huge but muscular and a judo near-expert.  Let's put it this way - he had a reputation for being very volatile.  He's 100% reformed now (being a gramps will do that, as will aging) but if he was on the warpath in the 70s and 80s, it was best to give him a wide berth and, certainly, not humiliate his oldest son.  \n\nWell, I didn't know when, but I knew the hurricane was coming and it came the next day at lunch.  My dad stormed into the gym and grabbed me and stomped to Mr. C's classroom where he was alone and doing some work on the chalkboard.  As we entered the room, my dad bellowed at Mr. C, \"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY SON???\"  There is no way to describe the abject fear in Mr. C's eyes as my dad closed on him.  They looked like dinner plates.  He tried to run but my dad grabbed him by the collar and banged him into the chalkboard and hit it with his fist.  I was honestly surprised it didn't crack.  Then he very loudly screamed what today would be dangerous criminal threatening but back in 1981 was blowing off steam.  There were no repercussions for my dad as he knew everybody in the school system and got on well with them.  The whole thing was over in like 15 seconds and Mr. C never looked me in the eyes again.",

No doubt he would have if Mr. C had smarted off.  No doubt at all.  I grew up in a pretty rural farming area in New England and mild violence was commonplace.  My dad physically dragged me out of a Little League game when I was catching in front of everybody, parents players, etc. when he thought I called the ump a fucker but really said sucker.  Another time - we lived near a state park and campground - and he caught flatlanders picking and eating his blackberries so he pulled his .44 Mag Ruger short rifle on them and walked them down the hill back to the park.  Cop (only one for our town) came by 20 minutes later and said, \"(Dad's name), you know better than that.  Don't do it again.\"  Got a million stories about all the crap we all did.  Wild family, wild era, wild times.  Family is very tight.  Honestly, a lot of my friend's dads were like that, too.",

Not sure what you would have done but I'm guessing you don't either.  That was certainly not a situation one (again, 11) can prepare for.  I sucked it up pretty good at the time.  Just retreated to a classroom where my friends, who followed, and I all discussed it.  They knew my dad and we all debated whether to tell him because who knows what the fuck he would do.  We knew he wouldn't be like, \"Oh, that's nice.\"  We knew he'd go volcanic as it was as much an affront to him, because it was his son, as it was to me.

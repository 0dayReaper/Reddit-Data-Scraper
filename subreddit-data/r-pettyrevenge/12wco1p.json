    "postText": "  \n\nMy friend \"Dan\" was smart and unconventional. He was a senior electrical engineer at a small company I worked for. This was in the 1970's.\n\nWhile talking about cars, and car modifications came up, he started explaining the importance of caster and camber in cars, and why it\u2019s so important to get it right. He then laughed and told me \"Did you know the motor vehicle regulations describe the size requirements for a windshield, but you don\u2019t actually have to have glass in the frame?\"  He learned this because he built a street-legal dune buggy from scratch while in high school, and the regulations are crazy complex.\n\nDan was smart - could fix about anything,  He started going to community college to get a degree, but quit because he knew more than the teacher. As I said, smart and unconventional.\n\nWell, the company we worked for was bought by a bigger company and our stock options because a nice windfall. I bought a new car outright, and used the rest as a down payment for a house. Others actually cashed their checks. It was a real rush to have that much cash in your hands once in your life. Dan was one of those. \n\nDan loved cars, and he always wanted to test drive a fancy car. And how could they refuse him with a wad of cash big enough to \u201cchoke a horse\u201d. So he went to the Fancy Car Dealer that had Jaguars, Mercedes-Benz, BMW\u2019s etc.\n\nAs I said, Dan was unconventional. He was tall and skinny. He had hair down to his shoulders, and a bushy beard.  He wore jeans, a light colored shirt, and a denim jacket. (This was before designer jeans became fashionable for men). He was never dirty, but frankly, he looked like he \u201ccame down from the top of a mountain looking for a good time\u201d. He was nearly always in a good mood, and normally had a goofy grin.\n\nAnd Dan loved cars. He had lots of technical questions about the car. So he showed up and waited for a salesman to approach him.\n\nAnd waited\u2026. And waited\u2026 And waited\u2026 The place wasn\u2019t busy at all, but after 30 minutes, he was fed up. He was obviously being purposely ignored.\n\nSo he gets an idea for petty revenge. He starts yelling. \u201cI came here to buy a car. And all of you just ignored me. And I was going to pay cash.\u201d And he whipped out the huge stack of $100 bills he had, spread them out, and waved it around for all to see.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m never coming back to this dealership again. I\u2019ll buy my car from another dealer.\u201d And he stormed out.\n\nHe laughed so much when he told us this story. I bet it felt great.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 Dan converted his stock options to a pile of cash, and taught a snobbish car that wearing denim doesn't mean you are poor.",

            "comment": "This reminds me of a story my mom told me. \n\nAlso back in the 70's, she went to a dealership to buy a car. She was working with a salesman and had gotten to the point where she was ready to buy the car. \n\nThe salesman insisted that her husband should be present for this kind of decision. She explained that it was her money for her car and it has nothing to do with her husband. \n\nThe guy wouldn't budge. So she looked at the next closest salesman and asked, \"do you want to sell a car?\"\n\nThe second salesman didn't need her husband's input.",

She dealt with him directly but he kept telling her to bring my dad in to make the deal. \n\nShe got mad, went to the rival dealership in town, and bought a car same day. Family friend heard about it and called my dad to ask why. \n\nMy dad told him he screwed up. Mom was the one buying the car, would be the one driving the car, so he should have sold her one. Tough luck!",

He goes \"you have a pretty big wedding ring, and you said something about a husband earlier so I am guessing he's the one who needs to sign the paperwork?\" I stared him right in the eyes for about ten more seconds and got up and walked out. The owner of the dealership called me 5 minutes later, begging me to come back, and even said he would fire that sales kid. I said \"too late buddy. Dealership across the river has the exact same car and I'm headed there to pay a grand more for it, as long as they don't insult me too. Don't call me again.\" Ugh",

And the salesman started playing games \"well, you'll want this, it's 300 more\" and \"We did rust treatment, so that ups the price 500\" (no, mom had NOT signed off on that). Finally he made the critical error: \"Your husband will tell you how important these are, so let us talk\". \n\nMy mother reached into her purse, pulled out a bank envelope and took out 12 1000 dollar bills (yes, they used to have 1000 dollar bills in Canada - they were withdrawn in Y2k). She very carefully counted out each one on the salesman's desk, looked up and said \"We have a legal contract. This is my part of it. You need to decide if you're going to fulfil your part. Either take my money and give me my car, or don't, and we can cancel the contract and I'll go to Ottawa with my money. But I'm not paying a cent more than we agreed on\". \n\nThey took her money. And she made them give her her 53 cents change.   \n\n\nShe drove that car into the ground. When they finally scrapped it 16? years later, it had \\~520 000 km on it!",

I had bought the car used a year prior for only $9000 so I wasn't interested in spending that much. I bought the parts online for $450 and my brother came down to help me do the work. We got it all replaced and pulled out of the driveway for a test drive and there was that damned loud squeak again.\n\nHe found a bolt in the subframe that he suspected was the problem and as soon as he turned it, it let out a loud screech. He cleaned a little rust off it, packed the bolt hole with grease, and reinstalled the bolt and we've had no squeaks since then. If the mechanic had ever bothered to find the source of the squeak, he would probably tell me I needed a whole new subframe instead of a little grease.",

In the early 2000 he was buying the newfangled Opel Zafira. He had gone for a few options so the car ended up costing in the neighbourhood of 350 000 kr. The sales guy was adamant he needed to finance the car. Old guy reduced. He had never financed a car till this day and paying one years wage in cash was not out of his reach. A lot of back an forth ends in the customer stating\n\n- if you don't shut up, I'll cancel the contract and never come back. \n\nThat was the end of that. \nYou don't pick up a car from the lot in Norway, you order your spec, and wait for it to be built. So a few months go by. \nHe is back with a huge suitcase filled with 50 kr notes. He is here to pick up the car and to pay for it in cash literally. You never buy a car with cash. Back when everything was black and white, you could use a cheque, ever since the introduction of portable phones, a money transfer like this would be by money transfer directly between the banks. \nIt took the whole sales department over an hour to count the money. \nHe signs of the last papers and gets his keys. \n\n- if you don't shut up about financing next time, I'll do this again. Your choice.",

Salespeople seem to think that women just can't be trusted to make such a big decision on her own so the \"man of the house\" has to do it. \n\nMy favorite personal story is that a local company sent their door-to-door people round my neighborhood to try and get people to buy their high-priced, low-quality products.  I knew the company was a joke, but decided to see what kind of things they'd say so I invited them round one day for a half-hour appointment.  When they got there, I told them up front I was not signing a contract that day. They spent close to an hour and a half trying to tell me that $11,000 for these 4 things and $7,000 down was the best that anyone was going to be able to do for me.  Oh and I couldn't use certain, very common, cleaning products on it because it would void the warranty.  They didn't want to leave until I signed a contract because they thought I could be forced to do so, but they left empty handed. \n\nI think they forgot that I'd said I was just shopping around and that I wasn't going to sign that day because, after all, I'm just a woman and I don't know what's best for me.  After all, I'm getting the work done with a different company who's charging me 2/3 the price for twice the work and talked me like I had not only a thought in my head, but several of them, all good, sensible ones.

He didn't like that much.\n\nI asked for the manager, and told him the sales manager deserved the sale. I would have gone somewhere else but they had the only one in the west.

He has 2 sales guys all over him, asking questions, showing him all the bikes he's like \"Na man, talk to HER I'm just the fat fuck giving her a ride\" they literally laughed and kept talking to him. I walked up to the cashier,  told her what I wanted, filled out all my paperwork before these assholes decided to even come talk to me. I made sure to talk to the manager and made it very clear that the cashier was to have to commission and that his sales guys were dicks.

But none of the male salesmen would come out and even say anything to her, not even hello can I help you? \n\nShe was there about 15 minutes and a guy in a suit walks in. 4 salesmen come out of nowhere...he tells them he just wants some literature, but he's not ready to buy. My mom put on her sunglasses, marched up to the group and said \"I was going to buy a brand new model x from you today in cash. However, since none of you could be bothered to even greet me you've just lost a customer. It's obvious that you don't think women have money. How wrong you are.\" \n\nMan in the suit handed the salesmen the literature back and walked out the door right behind my mom. The salesmen were actually running up to her to get her to come back. She went to their competitors and bought a new car and drove it over to the place and said \"told you so!\"",

Whether or not the customer had the money was finance's problem, not mine.\n\nOne day an older person pulled up in an ancient station wagon. His dog was in the back, in a crate. Some of my colleagues figured this was the kind of guy that would bargain forever, his dog would do something unpleasant, etc.\n\nI greeted him. He had one criteria - the back of the car be big enough to fit the dog crate. Found him what he was looking for. He bought the car for full sticker, less $500 for his old wagon. Biggest commission I had made that day, won the sales contest for that day as well.",

Decided she wanted a Z when they first were re-launched. \n\nThe kid at the dealership trotted up and was super helpful. A little too helpful. He had them test drive a decked out touring model when she just wanted a base model. After a few hours I get a call from my dad to please come down to the dealership and talk to her about this car.\n\nI had showed her the car online and what the basic prices were for each model and she had decided she didn\u2019t want to pay more than 30k. But the touring model was nice so she decided she wanted that one. But still pay the base price. It had been hours since they started negotiating and the manager ended up bringing out the actual paperwork for her car. They paid 31500 for it. So she said she would pay that to them. But they had to add the aero stuff in the chin and tail so it would like more like a Porsche. Retail on this was ~1600\n\nThe manager finally (and wearily agreed). They did the paperwork, dad thanked me for getting Mom \u201cto see reason\u201d and we went out so Mom could drive her car home. \n\nThe manager started pulling the still-in-the-plastic accessories out and my mom asked what he was doing. He explained that since she didn\u2019t purchase them he had to remove them. \n\nHer response was no one asked about those and since they were in the car when she drove it, they were part of the negotiation. He angrily dumped it all back in the hatch. \n\nLong story short my mother got her car for roughly cost then made the dealership give her extras to make up for their \u201cinflexibility\u201d on the price. \n\nThe kid that helped them? Didn\u2019t work work at the Nissan dealership- he worked at the Mazda dealership next door owned by the same people. It was his first day. \n\nPoor kid.",

He was out for the day and no one really paid us any mind or seemed to want to deal with us, despite the place being dead. This younger guy ended up rushing over to help us and was super nice. He let us take out some cars to test drive, answered all our questions and was just really down to earth. Honestly looked like he probably would get judged if he walked into a dealership too so I\u2019m guessing he had more empathy than most. We ended up walking out a couple hours later with a new telluride nightfall sx.\n\nNever felt smug or the need to give anyone mean looks. We were honestly just so happy our man was gonna get a commission and that we got to witness one of those rare moments where karma pays kindness. \n\nOther quick story: my mom was the head teller at a bank in the 80s/early 90s and she said that their richest client, BY FAR, was this guy that came in once a week dressed in jeans and boots and was often a little dusty from working on his farm and others would avoid him like the plague. She would laugh every time knowing his balance would give anyone a heart attack. She always said never judge a book by it\u2019s cover. \ud83d\ude02",

I could generally buy a new pickup there, drive it for a year making $200/mo payments, then sell it at a big city dealer and get about $1000 back. I went in with my wife and selected two pickups, one for each of us. I was listing the additional items that I wanted on each, like window tint, brush guards, etc and the salesman was getting agitated. I asked if he needed to write any of it down and he said that I was starting to rub him the wrong way-he wasn\u2019t going to do anything until I decided which of the two trucks I wanted and he had an approved credit check. Rub you the wrong way? I caught the eye of another salesman and asked if he wanted to sell two trucks. I\u2019ll take these two with these additional options if you can do it for the advertised price. Tell Bobby(sales manager) that it\u2019s me-I\u2019ll update my financial statement from last time if you\u2019re still doing the zero down and 2.9% financing. Within ten minutes Bobby said to come by tomorrow and let him buy us lunch and the tint and accessories will be done. How does that rub ya?",

We're looking at used bmw 535's, which aren't easy to find around here. We needed to drive about 45 minutes to the dealership, so we decided to couple that with a client meet up to pick up a dog (we show dogs professionally for a living.) For this reason, we took our \"work van.\" It's not broken down and smoking, but, well, it's a work van! \n\nWe walked in and were ignored as well. I finally walked up to one of the salesman, sitting with two others just shooting the shit. I informed them I was there for the BMW. They all gave me that snobby, TV worthy, up and down look of disgust. Without another word, he handed me a credit app and said, \"Fill this out. IF you get approved, I'll show it to you.\" \n\nI was pissed, but sat down and proceeded to look at the paper like the dumb hick he thought I was. The look of disgust on his face was priceless. He rolled his eyes and looked at his buddies who all giggled, like the obnoxious pricks they were. \n\nHe then proceeded to very smarmily all me if I needed help. I explained that I hadn't filled out a credit application in 20 years, but knowing this might be a possibility, I brought \"notes\" that I got from that, \"new internet thing my neighbor kid helped me look up.\" He got that same look and said, \"sure.\"\n\nThat's when I pulled out the envelope and started pulling hundreds out at a time saying, \"Nope, not on this one, or this one...\" until I had about 10 grand sitting on the desk (there was another 15k in the envelope (car was around 18k.) His whole attitude changed quickly and he ushered me into his GM's office and started telling the GM about how I was \"MR swissmtndog398\" here to buy the bmw, etc. \n\nIn front of his manager I looked him right in the eye and said, \"Wow, what changed? A few minutes ago, I couldn't even SEE the car without filling out a credit app and PASSING, or whatever ridiculous nonsense you stated. BTW...798 in case you're curious!\" I saw the light quickly torn on and extinguish in the GM's eyes. \"However, your employees utterly shitty, degrading attitude makes that impossible. \n\nAs I was gathering up my money, the GM begged me to reconsider. I told him I'd reconsider sharing this online in reviews on every site I can find you on. He pulled the, \"What can I do to change your mind?\" I informed him that, since my van was so noticeable, perhaps that salesperson should sit in a seat at the front window and watch as my old van drove across the street to a competitor and bought a car. Didn't think it would happen, but, sure enough, the guy was sitting IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING, outside on a fold up chair. I didn't skewer them on review sites. Hey, I'm a man of my word!",

So he went to the dealer in his standard dress which was a Hawaiian shirt, tattered shorts, and jandals. He literally got turned away. Said that they told him they don't deal with \"people like him\". So he went to another dealer and paid upfront for 2 Ferraris. Got his wife to drive one and they went back to the original dealship just to show the guy what he had missed out on. Would've loved to have seen his face!",

I was in my early 30s.  (let's also throw out that we bought a stupid big house and lived in a REALLY nice neighborhood of mostly older people, and we were young enough when we closed that I was always worried that my neighbors would knock on the door and ask to speak to our parents - having decent income young is harder than one might expect.  Being there made me edgy at being ignored because most people assumed we were young so we couldn't afford things).  I went to the local sewing machine store looking to buy an embroidery machine.  For those who aren't familiar, the top of the line models of those, back in the day, ranged in the 5-10K range, the software to run them costs several thousand more.  I had saved, knew what I was looking for, and went to the sewing machine store that was top of the line to look at them...  And couldn't get anyone to even make eye contact with me who worked there.  Gave them a decent amount of time with not even an acknowledgement, so I left (wish I'd rubbed it in a bit more after reading this, not gonna lie), went to the next brand's store on my list, and the owner of the place sat down with me, explained all the options and issues for each, and ended up selling me a machine I both loved, AND I stuck with the brand as I slowly worked my way up to a commercial quality embroidery machine.  She made a small *fortune* off of just being nice to every potential customer, because you NEVER know their story!",

My siblings and I were required to be able to change a tire, change (not just check) the oil, and change brake pads before we were given our first car. I was a single mom for 5 years before I met my now husband. In those 5 years I was dirt poor, and had a very used car, and couldn't afford to pay for repairs. I replaced the spark plugs one year, the throttle body the next, and the serpentine belt and all the pulleys a year later. Then had to replace the entire power steering rack. That was a doozie but I figured it out. Fast forward to 3 years ago, my husband bought me a 20 year old Jeep as a toy, big tires and all. We were out driving it one evening and stopped at auto zone to grab an oil filter. I got the filter and the oil while he was chatting with the guy at the counter, who he went to high school with. Went to check out and he says to my husband \"aw man is she making you change the oil? It's too hot outside for that,\" and laughs. Husband says \"no, man, she does all of our car stuff. That alternator I picked up for my truck last week? She put that in for me while I made dinner \" \ud83e\udd23 it's always hilarious to see men's reactions to this, because my husband is in a construction trade, and I look pretty girly.

Daddy went with her but always made it clear they had to deal with my mom. They almost always paid cash. The first sales person to greet her and find her what she wanted always got the sale.\n\nShe had managers try to hijack the sale after her sales person had done all the work. It never worked out well for the manager.\n\nI heard a story once about the famous pink Cadillac Elvis purchased for his mother. He'd signed his record deal but wasn't too well known to the point that anyone would recognize him.\n\nHe went to look at a Cadillac dealer wearing jeans and a simple shirt. Every one of the salesmen ignored him because they thought he couldn't afford a Cadillac, based on how he was dressed and the fact he showed up driving an old beat up pick up.\n\nAs a joke, the older salesmen sent the \"rookie\" out to talk to Elvis. They laughed as they watched what they thought was the rookie wasting his time showing someone so \"poor\" a Cadillac. \n\nWhen the rookie returned to the office, he was asked if he  sold a car. The rookie replied no. Everyone laughed until the rookie spoke again.\n\nWe informed them he sold five. The others looked on on shock. The rookie explained that the young man had just signed a record deal and wanted to spend some of the money on gifts for his parents and others who had helped him along the way.\n\nA little closer to home, and not quite so extravagant. I was in a local department store when I was young. A group of young men (17 to 19 probably) asked a sales lady if they had any Nehru style jackets. It was the mid seventies so it wasn't an unusual request. They were all wearing jeans and what I now know were fraternity jersies. \n\nThe lady was rude and told them they didn't have any and even if they did, people \"like them\" couldn't afford them anyway. I was a little kid at the time and I wanted to punch this woman in the nose.\n\nMy mom and I talked about how rude the woman was as we continued window shopping. An hour later we saw the same three guys carrying huge bags from another store. Mom and I nearly laughed out loud when we overheard one of the guys ask another if they spent too much.\n\nThe guy asked the question responded (and I'll never forget this) \"Nah. Dad gave me his credit card so we all looked great for my sister's wedding.\"\n\nNo one in sales should assume anything about a potential customer just based on how they look.",

On the way back home to home port, the boat stops by in the big city. \nThe selection in clothing stores was better than the two back home and there were more bars than you could count. Especially after a few dozen beer. \nBut out hero in this story has only one goal. An AUDI RS6. \n\nSo when the boat docks, the first thing he does is to grab a cab and bring him to the AUDI dealership. Where he is met with a shrug. Not even him telling the sales guy, he's her for a car gets him any reaction. \nAfter a while he calls for a cab again and heads for the BMW dealership where he orders an fully specked BMW M5. \nThere are no cars on the lot in Norway. When you buy a car here, you spec the configuration you want, and wait for it to be built. \n\nSo when he came back a couple of months later, now freshly shaven and in nicer clothes, he stops by at the AUDI dealership again. \nHe walks in the door, and this time the sales guys reacts. \n- Hey, I wanna show you something outside. \n\nThe sales guys follow him outside and see a brand new M5. \n\n- what i really wanted was an RS6, but you guys didn't bother to sell me anything. So long suckers! \n\nHe jumps into the car and spins of the parking lot.",

Cars were a minor hobby of mine. I do some of my own mechanical work. \n\nThe STUPID sales guy kept talking to my husband about the vehicle I was looking at.

She came out with him, and I told him what had been happening then informed him the receptionist was going to sell me a car today or I was leaving. After he tried to tell me she couldn't do that, I started to leave and they gave in! She sold me that car. \n\nA month later I went back to the dealership to pick up my permanent plates and she was back working at the reception desk. She jumped up and gave me a giant hug and said  \"thank you! This is my last week working here, I got a new job as a sales associate at &lt;insert high end European car maker here&gt;. \n\nSweet sweet revenge. She got the commission from the shitty sales guy AND left them in the lurch for a receptionist. Five years later, I bought another car from her.

I told the other salesman his previous customer was here and he saw who it was and said oh I just sold him a vehicle he is to upside down in his loan tell him I am not available. At this point I walk out to the borrower and said his previous salesman was unavailable but I would be happy to help. The customer asked to look at a used truck and I showed him the truck and we took it for a test drive. We went in to talk numbers and he was upside down on the loan in his current vehicle, at this point he says well unfortunately I was diagnosed with terminal cancer and I have about 4-6 months max and I have always wanted to buy a truck but never have. He had $15k in cash on him which was enough for him to get approved for a new loan, he drove off the lot that day in his new truck. The other salesman couldn\u2019t believe it and was bitching up a storm to the sales manager saying I should have to split the commission but the sales manager disagreed of course. I hope that guy enjoyed the truck with the time he had left.",

We went to the local BMW dealership and with a toddler and a me very pregnant with us we were told we couldn't afford a BMW. My husband was not in uniform at the time so the salesman had no idea of my husband's rank. The salesman would not even open a vehicle for us to sit in let alone take a test drive. What a jerk.\n\nSo we drove to Wichita Falls, TX and test drove several Mercedes Benz we were interested in. Bought a 300D Turbo which we both loved driving. When it came time to pick up the vehicle my OB-GYN would not let me leave town as I was close to my due date. The dealership had one of their guys drive the car to Lawton and my front door.  I dropped him off at the bus station. \n\nWe had fun driving by the BMW dealership frequently and would wave from my lovely Mercedes. By the way, my husband's rank at the time was Lieutenant Colonel and he was in the dental corp so we could easily afford either a BMW or the Mercedes. We had the Mercedes for 16 years and 3 moves.",

Well, obviously, they would brush them off or even down right ignore them. So if he\u2019d go down the next dealership down the line till he found one that would sell him what he wanted. He then go home, change clothes, and visit every one of the dealerships that refused him. I am flaunted his new Cadillac with all the bells and whistles and reminded them of the commission they missed out on.

My mom made sure I knew how to negotiate \n\nWent to a dealership and they flat out told me they couldn't help me 'at my price' aka they were trying to get me to pay over sticker. It was a Honda dealer. I'd been doing research for months on what SUV to buy and narrowed it down to a 2018 CR-V. New enough at the time to still be under warranty, good track record for being low maintenance, had all the things I required. all that was left was to test drive it and check it over. They wanted too much. I walked out. They called me a day later to see if I wanted to renegotiate. By that point I had found another '18 CR-V. This time at a different dealership altogether. I'd leased a car from them in the past so I called them up and went over. CR-V again had everything I wanted, was still under warranty, had brand new tires at the time, and a few bells and whistles I didn't need but we're nice to have. I drove it and looked it over. I told them how much I was willing to pay (a lie, I was willing to pay more) and we settled on a deal. I drove home that day after spending a couple hours munching on free popcorn and coffee.\n\nI got a better car for less than they were asking at the other dealership. This one has lower mileage, a little bit of a warranty left, one owner who barely drove it. When the Honda dealership called me again, I said I'd already bought a car.",

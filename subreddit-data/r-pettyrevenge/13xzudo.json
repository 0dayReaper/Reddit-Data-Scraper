    "postText": "One of those two-laned drive thrus\n\nPerson ahead of me blocked the queues, waiting to see which of the two lines was advancing faster, before picking their lane.\n\nIf they'd just pick a lane at the start, I'd wait to see who gets their order first (they inch ahead abit before I'm done) and I'd wait to let them go. But no, they block both queues.\n\nCue me following the person ahead of me 2 inches to block the other person from getting to the booth. The person at the payment window even thought their order was mine, but oh well.\n\nPlay stupid games and lose!\n\nI wish I thought to pay and claim their order. Big Mac with 10 piece chicken nuggets sounds good, they can have my McDoubles lmfao. Next time.\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty sure they tried to follow me home, so I circled into a parking lot to get behind them and watched them turn the other direction at the next light. Play stupid games twice, lose twice! lmfao",

I haven't been down to that McDonald's since the mid 90's, so it may have changed by now, the art school has bought up half the neighborhood and gentrified the shit out of it.",

It was awesome! I'm sure they've \"remodeled\" by now, and done away with that efficient method, like all the others.",

    "postText": "Title is pretty straightforward but I'll elaborate. My old college roommate didn't know how to cook or do dishes and didn't go food shopping much. This led to him eating my food, especially my leftovers as those were prepared meals. I would use my leftovers to meal prep for the week, and told him to stop as it was expensive as well as inconvenient. The behavior did not stop and he actually seemed to be eating more of my food out of spite. To punish him, I baked a chocolate cake with habanero peppers and mixed the frosting with wasabi. I labled it with my name and a bold \"Do Not Eat\" and waited. This guy has a very low tolerance for spicy foods so I thought he would take one bite quickly realize the error of his ways. About two days later, him and a couple of his friends got really drunk while I was at work and decided to dig into my food. Somehow, they ate about a third of it before realizing, and when they inevitable went to throw up from over drinking and eating spicy foods, got hit by the cake a 2nd time. Don't know for sure but it couldn't have felt good coming out the backend. When he asked me why I made this monstrocty I told him I found a chocolate habanero recipe online that I wanted to try. He stopped eating my cooking after that.",

That info led me to finding [this study about the baboons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347285800312).

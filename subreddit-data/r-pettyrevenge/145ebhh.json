    "postText": "tldr at bottom, i know i'm a long-winded storyteller. you wouldn't believe how much i cut from the first draft of this story about a 5 minute traffic exchange. \n\ni work at a department store in a plaza off the main road into town, and getting out at rush hour is a nightmare. a lot of side roads and the interstate converge right next to the majority of businesses in town. this day was exceptionally backed up since an 18 wheeler flipped on the interstate. with the added traffic hitting town, there's always the crowd who are convinced some crappy backroad will cut an hour off their commute. at the end of the backroad of choice here, it's a right turn at a 4 way stoplight to keep going into town. so, everyone on it decided \"right on red\" actually means \"unless someone that has the green light t-bones us, we always have right of way\". \n\neventually i made it up to second in line at the light. at this point i had been on this 8 mile stretch of road for 45 minutes with the same two older guys in subarus both in front and behind me. about halfway through our third green light of being cut off by the right on red crowd, ol' boy in front of me just plows through. the guy behind me actually starts enthusiastically clapping, immediately i love his energy. it's traffic, so there's no going far, but guy in front makes it through the intersection. once he fully cuts off the right on red crowd, i start creeping in. there's not enough room for the subaru behind me, so he stops a little ahead of the stop bar to let people turning in/out of businesses through. class act.\n\nso i'm just rolling up to the subaru in front, and some guys turning out of the side road take major issue with me. they start waving around screaming at me to move so they can squeeze in. they have a small car but there's clearly no room, they just want to get in enough to cut off the guy behind me. up until this point, i've just been happy to be sitting down and listening to my own music after an 8 hour retail shift. but again, just got done with an 8 hour retail shift, i had seen some entitlement. the audacity of these men to lean out of their car and scream at me so they can cut off this guy who was already letting people through broke something in me.\n\nof course they had tried to intimidate the guy in front of me too and were already pulled up as much as possible, which made them boxed in by the people behind them (who were actually at the stop bar). so with my ears ringing with rage so loud i could barely hear them screaming, i pulled up so my back tire was just in front of their bumper. basically making it so they can't move without hitting me. sitting in my little shitbox wearing my pathetic retail uniform, i look the driver dead in his eyes, turn up my stupid dad rock to drown out their screams since all of us had our windows down, and put my car in park. right as their light turns green. can see the guy behind me is clapping again lol. \n\nto make it better, their entire green light cycle the traffic didn't move. right as their light changed to red somebody turned off and made just enough space for me to move forward and let the subaru behind me through. of course i waved clapping guy up so he could continue the cycle of cutting this jackass off, and he caught on INSTANTLY and was visibly laughing. the last i saw as the light in front of me cleared was the entitled duo getting stuck in the same situation by the next person.\n\n\n\nTLDR; accident on interstate causes major traffic jam. people try to skirt the worst of it by taking a side street and abusing the right on red rule. after multiple light cycles of them cutting everyone off by going on red, myself and the car in front of me cut a particularly rude and entitled duo off and stop the side street reign of tyranny. the car behind me plays heavy support, and the particularly entitled duo seem to have angled themselves perfectly for this to have continued for a while.",

            "comment": "Oooh! I love these kinda traffic asshole stories! I got a doozy I like to share.\n\n There is this intersection by where I grew up. it has right turn only lane that people love to try n blow by and cut off people who are in the thru lane. On the other side of the intersection there is only one lane for people driving thru and a big ass curb on the right. So if a person was trying to cut in last min they would have get in the lane before the other side of the intersection. (This would be easier if I could draw a pic) so I have been cut off at this intersection probably at least 25% of the times I drove thru. So I am fairly cautious driving here. Well one day I see the light is green for me so I don't have to stop and I'm fixing to drive thru but in my mirror I see some dick knocker flying up in the turn lane. I'm driving a car that I didn't want damaged but if I swapped paint with some asshole no sweat really. So I speed up to prevent turd face from cutting me off.... Well dontcha know it buddy trys to get by me but ends up hitting that curb so hard he got airborne like dukes of Hazzard. I'm pretty sure the car was a late 80s thunderbird and crazy thing was. Even tho I wasnt slowing down the car sorta passed me and I seen it out of the passenger window. The rad musta exploded because there was steam and plastic flying all over. I didn't stop to see how that all ended but in the rearview mirror I seen alot of dust and steam and myself cheesing like some kid at a demolition derby.",

Some dipshit, usually in an expensive car, always abuses the parking lane/breakdown lane/turn lane/whatever and then goes to nose back into the main line of backed-up traffic. AND SOME DAMN SIMP ALWAYS LETS THEM IN!",

            "comment": "This is my story. I was in rush hour traffic and for some reason the guy beside me didn't like me. I have no idea why. So he is yelling at me, so I just point at him, myself and the next turnoff. Sure enough he follows me at the turnoff. It just so happened that my condo was about 100 yards from the turnoff, so I drove there and used my card to get into the underground parking. He could have followed me underground, but then he would be stuck there because you need a card to get back out. Instead, he had to circle around and try and find a way to get back on the highway. Unless you live there, it can be difficult to know how. Good luck with that.",

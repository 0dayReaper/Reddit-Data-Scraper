    "postText": "We have a next door neighbor who does not like us, for no apparent reason.  This is a vacation home for them and we have never said a single word to or interacted with them ever.  They seem to think we live in an HOA, which we don't, and call the city code enforcement on us over their perceived shortcoming in our lifestyle.  We let our yard pretty much grow wild whereas theirs is meticulously landscaped and professionally tended.  We have six foot walls between houses so they can't see much of anything in our yard without trying.  Such as climbing a ladder to take pictures to send the city to lodge a complaint.  The city investigates, finds nothing wrong and closes the complaint.  The last complaint happened a few months ago when we were doing some legally permitted construction.  The neighbor calls the city, they come out and find no issues. Apparently he was upset with this outcome and he made more complaints, of which only one was \"valid\".  He complained about our vehicle parked on the street not having a current registration sticker.  Parking enforcement came out and put a sticker telling me to fix the problem or move it within 3 days.  Apparently, my current license plate sticker had been scraped off.  While out front, I noticed my neighbors new motor home parked in front of his house.  It's illegal in the city to park a motor home on the street. Normally, I could not care less about it, but this seemed like an opportunity I couldn't pass up.  I asked the parking guy, what about that thing?  He said there was no complaint about it, so I said, I am complaining.  I watched as he took pictures and wrote out the parking ticket/tow order.  I then watched as, about an hour later, the tow truck eagerly hook it up and whisk it away to their impound lot.",

So when I was in college out of state my vehicle was registered in obviously another state as it was still in my parents name. We were late getting it's registration renewed as I wasn't able to get it back to be inspected. We got it done before I was ever pulled over so thought everything was good. So quick recap all my paperwork is current and on hand, I have the relevant sticker on my plate so everything should be good right? We'll get back to colleges state and I get pulled over, apparently the database they use/check for out of state vehicles still has me flagged as expired... And they're threatening a ticket which blew my mind cause I have the sticker and receipt/paperwork saying it's taken care of, but this officer doesn't care, thinks I'm being uppity when I ask what he expects me to do about their database being wrong. He tells me I'll just get a warning and to contact my state to update their db... Yeah so I did and my state has zero idea what I'm talking about as everything is current and has been for months and they don't know of any database that could be out of sync so I'm told to ask them what the database name is, like can't you all just handle this and leave me out of it. So yeah that's how I learned that it doesn't matter what you have if someone wants to hassle you, they're gonna hassle you.",

The database said it expired the day before I was pulled over!! The cop let me go since I was right around the way from my destination. He also didn't seem to believe me, even though my physical DL had next year it was expiring. He asked if the license was real. I went and dropped $54 I couldn't afford at the time to renew.

If I renewed my license on Feb 1, 2023, the next expiration date will be March 1, 2027.\n\nConfusing system. It's almost like they want a reason to give people tickets or something.",

It\u2019s called MTO here, and we have an agency called Service Ontario where you can deal with your MTO needs, health care renewals, birth, marriage and death certificates and many other administrative needs. Some of this can be done online. You can schedule in-person appointments. Even without an appointment, waits can be quite short. For a government initiative, it\u2019s surprisingly efficient. At one point there were kiosks in malls.\n\nWhen we hear US stories of people taking days off work to attend to their DMV needs, or spending hours in line, it blows our minds. For many Ontarians, that\u2019s not our experience and never has been. Don\u2019t you find it upsetting that your celebrities and politicians don\u2019t have to do any of that because they get special treatment?",

The only time I\u2019ve had to go to a DMV office in the last 15 years was to get my motorcycle permit, and then motorcycle license, which required an eye test and new picture.",

It was a huge revenue generator back when they decided to save money by not sending reminders. Realistically it\u2019s not that bad, as sometimes you can do it completely online.\n\nThat reminds me, I need to try again.  Unfortunately my last expiration was during COVID and the adoption of RealID. I\u2019m left in some limbo where I renewed my license but due to COViD closing RMV offices was not able to complete the RealID process so I still have an expired license.  I can\u2019t renew it because it already was but I have to carry my passport everywhere as another form of ID.\n\nYes, in my 50\u2019s with grey hair, I actually got carded and refused alcohol.  At least it was amusing, getting a newly legal 21 year old in our group to buy me alcohol (work outing.  Don\u2019t be gross)",

When you're 65 in Arizona, and then every certain amount of years I can't remember anymore. In Idaho, it's every 4 years until you're 21 (which is weird, since you have to be 16 to get one), and then every 8 until you're 65. After that, you never have to renew. That one really gets to me - the reason Arizona requires it at 65 is an eye exam and a very, very basic assessment that you can still drive okay semi regularly. Idaho is like \"we know you are about to reach a point when you're not safe driving, so we'll go ahead and just not make you come in to renew. Have fun out there!\"",

They take the pictures, but you actually don't have to have them updated, anyway. There's no exam or anything until you're 65. Then you have to go in person every time and have a basic eye exam or bring proof of a recent one from an optometrist. Oh, and for reasons I don't understand, you have to renew in person until you're 24. Most people do go in once they turn 21, even if not expired yet, because the under 21 license looks different and can't be accepted for alcohol, tobacco, vape, or marijuana sales even if you're over 21.\n\nYou get a paper print out saying you renewed, and if it's in person, they punch a hole in your old one, invalidating it. The replacement takes a week or two to show up in the mail, though when I had to renew in early October of 2020, I didn't get it until December.",

The cop followed me from the store where I'd been shopping and stopped me when I got on the highway on-ramp (???).  I guess they didn't like Shelby county plates down there.  He asked a bunch of questions, scrutinized the interior of my car- giving special attention to my 2 yo in his car seat- and told me that my car was the wrong color.  I showed him the little yellow unpainted spots left from where my ex had driven it as a cab, and decided to buy it.  When he quit I had to get a loan to pay it off, and the cab company refused to finish the transaction until I also paid them to repaint it.  And did a terrible job.\n\nYears later I was talking to a guy who had left his job as a detective in that department, and I told him the story.  He told me that he was sitting in his cruiser on the other side of the overpass, laughing his ass off while the cop was on the radio trying to find out if he could ticket me for that.  (He could not.)\n\nSouthaven hates Memphis, even though a great deal of its income is from Memphis shoppers.  And, by the way, I'm as white as they come.\n\nAsshole cops.  \ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\udd95",

Then officers jumped out with guns drawn. \n\nAfter about 45 minutes of sitting in the back of a cruiser they determined that Illinois had reported the car recovered, but Missouri did not have that information. The officers did not believe him when he told them that it was his car and had been returned after being solen. But after checking ids and registration they checked with Illinois before taking him to jail. They did release him as soon as they got the correct status, but there was no apology, and they acted like it was his fault.

I used to work as a midnight to dawn console operator, and any AH I got coming through during the night, which was plenty, would have me checking the vehicle's plate on my phone. There would at least be one that wasnt driving registered and that would have me filing a report at the counter of the local police station, I'd then have a cop within a week come through on my shift asking for a copy of the CCTV footage.    \nMy workplace always told us to comply with police requests, so I would MC and hand over the CCTV footage. Well one of the fools complained to my head office, telling them I called the police on them. So, my AM came in early the next day to ream me about it, right as the guy drove in, I didnt see the AM, but saw the guy, and immediately checked his registration. Still unregistered, was about then I noticed the AM coming to the staff door and let him in. So he immediately starts asking me about the call to the police, and asking why there wasnt a report for the incident.   \nI of course had no clue, at the time, to the incident he is referring to. That is until the guy comes in after filling his car, comes to the counter and starts getting in my face about calling the police on his car. The AM immediately interjects and asks the guy if he is such and such, which he admits he is. I at this point have tilted my phone up so the AM can see the screen and unregistered in clear red txt on the screen. AM looks at my phone, looks out to the car, looks to the guy, looks to the police car pulling in behind said guy's car, looked back at him and goes \"That will be $20 for your fuel, is there anything else you wish to get?\"  \nWell, this guy went from off like a nuke, which drew the attention of the cop who had gotten out to fill his car and he immediately runs in, hand on taser and asks what the issue is. The guy didnt even turn around, just goes off about how these AH's had called the cops on him for being unregistered. The cop relaxes slightly, until I go \"Yeah, and officer he's still driving around unregistered, despite getting a visit from other officers.\" The guy immediately turned around and looked slightly panicked. Turns out, he was also driving unlicensed that day, having lost his license the day before for high=speed in another vehicle.",

We know it was him, because we'd see him over on the edge of our properties staring at stuff and writing notes. Be more subtle, dude. Right now, he's got two broken down mini vans on his curb that haven't moved in months. I might call again. ;)",

I can't promise he was right. Now, the county person who comes might tell you, but they don't have to. Not all of them will. He's so obvious, we don't need to ask. The man will watch for county to show up, and then come over and point out whatever it was, and then loudly argue with them when they tell him it's not a violation. They aren't allowed to just ignore the complaint unless it's a repeat, and they've already verified. \n\nThe neighbors across the street who have been here since 1978 said he moved in about two decades ago, and he's always been like this. He was the only one who voted to keep the HOA and was very put out when it got cancelled. He claimed it had to be unanimous, but it only required a 2/3 majority. He'd been trying to get on the board, but the vote was always a unanimous no then. LOL \n\nIt's just ridiculous that *he* is the only one with violations. We leave him alone as long as he leaves us alone, though.",

Now they can pull you over for more reasons. \n\nMy sisters partners license was suspended for 30 days and my sister was driving her partners car and she was pulled over because the car came up as being registered to an unlicensed driver. \n\nSame with my ex\u2019s mom. His dad lost his license years ago for medical reasons but her car is in both of their names and she was pulled over several times for having an unlicensed driver on the registration of that car. \n\nIn both cases that was the sole reason for the stop. Neither party broke any laws or did anything to warrant the stops. We gave up stickers for cops to have easier access to trample on our rights.",

They aren't allowed to be there, technically, but the city will come mark them. If they haven't been moved in 3 days, then they'll get towed. They don't care how long a car was there before it was marked. The three days starts from that point.  RVs are banned from street parking on all our narrower streets to prevent wrecks. To be allowed to park on street with an RV, the street has to be wide enough for a car to park across from it and two vehicles to be driven past one another between them. Even then, it's not allowed permanently. You can only do it for 4 hours at a time, to allow loading or unloading. There's a reason a lot of houses in the suburbs have concrete RV pads next to the garage. Honestly, though, the city doesn't generally go around looking for them. Someone has to call in a complaint.",

Well, I looked inside and noticed **IT WAS NOT MY CAR!**\n\nI tried to peel off the sticker but it came apart in pieces.  I then went back inside the courthouse expecting to have repay the complete registration fee.  However, they only charged me three dollars for a new one.\n\nTwo last things; I will never buy another white four door sedan ever again : I did not damage the existing sticker on the wrong car.",

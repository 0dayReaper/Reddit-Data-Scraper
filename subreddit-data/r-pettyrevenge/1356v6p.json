    "postText": "Background; non Catholic forced to go to Catholic school grades 8-12 (USA) for reasons.  Me: very logical, good in math and science, reads nothing but sci-fi and encyclopedias.\n\nEighth grade: Creepy priest teaches a unit on mythology, clearly skewed to show what nonsense it is to worship all those gods instead of just his.  He meets all of the asshole priest stereotypes, fat, smoker, and very strict with student behavior but not his own.\n\nForgot about that tucker, except taking the lesson to never scribble out words on a report (ten points off per instance!)\n\nAfter being forced to take religion classes (it was a Catholic school after all) grades 8, 10, and 11, and did ok because I could half-listen and absorb information to spew back later.  Grade 12 that asshole shows up again.  This time skinny, but even creepier for the weight loss.  Still a dickhead.\n\nDay one of class I got the heads up that he was going to ask every student, one at a time, \"May I cherish you?\" but was given no other warning.\n\nI had no clue what that really meant, so when he asked me, the first person in the class alphabetically, and at the front of the class, I said No.  Scowling, he moved on to the next victim, and proceeds to press his entire body against every. damn. student.  Boys and girls.  Not one other person said no, even after watching this abusive ass touch every student but me.  I never appreciated how the church brainwashed the flock until that day.  And how brainwashed I was that I said nothing to the administration.\n\nNaturally he then hates me because I'm not going to be groomed.  I'm trouble in his class, whatever the title of the class was.  I can recall only one lesson, \"The 7 proofs of God\", probably written by some high as fock, half-starved priest in a godforsaken abbey in the dead of winter.  It was the usual poorly reasoned \"we can't know what he knows so he's clearly God\" b.s., he comes out with \"Whatever is, is, and cannot not be.\"  Of course logical me is hearing this drivel and can't hold his tongue, so I point out that the statement is circular logic and proves nothing.  \"TO THE OFFICE!\"  I get my one and only detention in four years of high school, and I'm later taken to some dark corner of the admin enclave and get sat in a low chair while he sits up on the desk legs spread wide.  Yeah, a really classy predator.  I wanted to slam a heavy book in his crotch.  I say nothing to him and ignore everything said.  (Probably should have listened and written it down to collect on the abusive priest fund my state is doing now decades later.)\n\nThe rest of the year in his class consists of letting his b.s. roll off my back.\n\nFinals time: he tells us the the exam will be all multiple sentence answers.  Basically writing the equivalent of a thousand word essay in 1.5 hours, something that my hands would be sore for days after.  F-ing sadist mother tucker.\n\nThe revenge: knowing that there are really no wrong answers to religion, and they wouldn't dare fail me for writing nonsense that answer the questions in my own way, I start the first line with a word that begins with \"F\", second line, \"A\", \"T\", \"H\", and so on, reading down so the first letters spell \"Father Dan is an asshole\".  I got in at least three sequences like this before time was called.",

The existence of the schools trickled into popular culture as a casual and positive thing for the students, mentioned occasionally on the Western TV shows from the 60s.  Have you seen the modern series \"1923\" on Paramount?  They have a compelling story arc about one school, where we end up cheering for the escaped students.\n\nGood on your Elders for working to get your land back.  The course I took focused on the legal (mis)treatment of the Indigenous.  Very dry, but I learned an important lesson that our government can be trusted only when the interests of the leaders align with your own.",

To get into my school I had to have the support of a parish priest. So a family member from his parish called in a favor. The presit in question taught my dad when he was at primary school and was a known creep. My mum took me aged 11 to get my supporting letter to apply to my Catholic secondary school and this creep insisted on having his arm around my shoulders unecessarily the whole time we were there. Gross. Anyway I'd been to a sleepover recently when nits had been doing the rounds at my primary school. He was a short dude and was wearing a particularly fuzzy jumper over his black shirt and dog collar, uh-ohs! I  later learned from my churchgoing relative he'd picked up my headlice (I didn't know I had at the time) from having his head waaaaay to close to wiry, long hair of an eleven year old girl he didn't know well. From what my dad told me he had creepy vibes when he was a boy too so its unlikey he could iddentify me as the source as he was liking clingy with a bunch of minors. Serves him right from being over familiar with a child. What's wrong with these dudes?! Ick. Also \"may I cherish you\" made me throw up in my mouth a little.",

    "postText": "This story begins during the Covid gaming glory days of 2020, but we'd been \"internet\" friends for about 8 years at this point. \n\nHe was always pretty abrasive, but was fun to play with in our little gaming group when he wasn't being toxic to the rest of us (best thing was to direct the toxic stuff towards the other team).\n\nAnywho, he begins a campaign of bringing up my partner's boobs, referring to them as \"milkers\", constantly, in every single conversation about anything, without prompt. I asked him to stop, as it wasn't really funny, I was uncomfortable, and due to covid, my partner and I were playing games from the same room most nights as there was very little else to do. \n\nIt got to the point that I stopped coming onto discord to avoid the comments after about 4-5 months of this constant barrage. She couldn\u2019t hear the comments, but it was super weird.\n\nI was still working in customer service (retail) during the lockdowns, as bikes were considered essential services. After a long day of dealing with stressed staff, and difficult clients, I didn't really feel like an incel cherry on top.\n\nI guess that's the context for what happens next;\n\nWell he started up a twitch stream, again, classic 2020 pandemic mode.\n\nThe ten or so of us that played with him had no idea, but he was streaming our games and discord conversations onto his twitch, and when caught and confronted about it, got super mad that we didn't really want to be on his channel all the time. \n\nWe sometimes used real names on discord, plus he'd banned us all so we couldn't participate in his chat. We (all) had a massive falling out, and he left the discord, preferring to stream to his nightly 4 viewers, 2 of whom are bots, and 1 is his brother.\n\nAnyway, so I've now created over 100 twitch accounts to say mean things to him on his stream, and he's only finally learned to set his account to verified only (mobile), so now he's stuck at &gt;600 followers and has been for months, though he thinks that twitch is pure luck unless you're a female.\n\nHe has put on about 70kgs, got kicked out of home (he is 30) , constantly tweets about Elon/Mr.Beast and at female streamers saying he is \"bricked up\", pretends to be a mental health advocate while also calling people R\\*tard and G\\*y.\n\nI appreciate the grind, but streaming to less than 5 people for two years seems to not be working out, and 1/4 of his followers are my troll accounts.",

Maybe he should take a look at top 10 streamers on Twitch and see how many are actually men.  \nHe is just a bad streamer with no personality, who also is toxic.   \nGood you got rid of him!",

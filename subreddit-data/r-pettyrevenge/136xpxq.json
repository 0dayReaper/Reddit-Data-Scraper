    "postText": "This story probably belongs more on some sort of r/coworkerstories or something. I dunno, you all decide. Usual \"if this doesn't belong, take it down and tell me where to post it.\" Deal. I'm English speaking and on a desktop, so any spelling/grammar errors are my own damn fault.\n\ntl;dr: I drive to work in the snow, can't clock in til coworker gets there. He's late, wasn't going to come, wasn't going to call me to let me know. Requires me to pick him up so he doesn't have to walk 1/4 mile in the snow. Expects a ride home as well, doesn't get one.\n\nAssume any names are changed. One guy has three names, as you'll see. For the purposes of the post I'm making up all of them.\n\nSo I've had some terrible co-workers in the past, but one of the worst had to be \"Gary.\" There was literally only ONE good thing about Gary. Any time I went to bitch about him to anyone I didn't work with, I got to start the story like this:\n\n\"So I have this coworker, Gary. His name isn't really Gary, it's William. He goes by Dimitri.\"\n\nAnyone who got that introduction to a \"Gary story\" would almost always give the exact same literal double-take reaction. Following along, then a \"wait... wut?\" moment. It was (and still is) hilarious. (I can actually explain the whole name thing, but as it's unrelated to the rest of the story I'll hold off unless someone requests it in the comments.)\n\nBut that's where anything positive about Gary ends. He was hired to do an overnight packout shift with me and another manager. It had just been us two, but they decided to make this overnight thing every night of the week, so we needed a third person. Would take too long to pointlessly describe the whole job, but suffice to say during this overnight shift we were the ONLY employees in the building.\n\nHe was frequently late, and due to a rule about \"no one can be in the building by themselves\" for safety reasons or something, if he was late that meant whichever manager was working the shift with him had to wait til he arrived before we could go in the building, and would sometimes miss out on some pay. He was slow. Very slow. We trained him as best we could, encouraged him to ask questions about anything he was unsure about (which he wouldn't do, he'd just do the job wrong meaning we usually had to fix it), and even months later when he was well out of training, he'd frequently do tasks incorrectly and SLOW! On average, he'd get done in 8 hours what it took the other manager 90 minutes to do. He'd frequently just ignore work related texts or calls, and have BS excuses as to why he never responded to them (such texts didn't happen often. It's not like we had to be 'on call 24/7, but a simple response AT ANY FREAKING POINT is appreciated). And until he got SEVERAL talkings to, he'd take an abnormally large amount of time to 'get ready' after clocking in, and extra long breaks.\n\nWe didn't like Gary. But no one else wanted the overnight shift (besides me and the other manager) so he was the only 'third' we would get for a long while.\n\nWell one day (night) it snowed. It snowed quite a lot. I left early to get to work on time. Gary bikes into work (like 2 blocks from the store), so I figured he'd be walking in due to the snow and might be a little behind.\n\nHe's 15 minutes late. I text him for his eta.\n\nGary: They haven't plowed my street yet.\n\nI begin a text, trying not to let anger get the best of me and use diplomatic workplace appropriate language, addressing the fact that it is 15 minutes after the shift started and he HASN'T LEFT HIS HOUSE YET, and was apparently going to WAIT FOR THEM TO PLOW HIS ROAD!? And he apparently wasn't even going to call or text me to let him know this supposed decision. He bikes, he can't bike in the snow, so I figured he'd walk. And he hasn't left yet, and I'm losing overnight pay waiting for him.\n\nBut before I can finish my text which was probably just going to be \"Wait, so you haven't even left yet?\"I get another text asking if I could pick him up.\n\nI silently fume and curse to myself, but settle for asking his address, and heading over to get him. Short drive since he was so close, but almost got my car stuck on his unplowed backroads.\n\nOn the way back to the store I begin getting his excuses. He can't bike because it's snowing. \"So walk, it's not far.\" He has a hole in his shoe, his socks would get wet. \"So bring a change of socks with you and change when you get here.\" But then \\[his\\] shoe would still be wet, which would get any new socks wet, and he didn't want to work all night wet socks.\n\nI've had to walk and/or bike to work before as well. I'm internally screaming solutions in my head, as well as just mentally screaming \"then at least CALL OR TEXT ME so I know what's going on instead of having to ask where you are 15 minutes after you should have been here!\" (technically longer, we're supposed to arrive a little early and be 'clocked in and working' by shift start. No payroll bs, we'd be paid for time clocked in early). But finally I just kinda bite my tongue and try to will my blood pressure to lower.\n\nCherry on the cake was, because of the snow our order didn't show up that night. We didn't actually end up having to come in at all. But we couldn't know that until we got to work as all dialog with distribution could only be done via the 'work phone' in the store. Oh well.\n\nWe wouldn't even find out for certain \"the truck isn't coming\" for a few hours, so we ran backstock while we waited. ALL the backstock. Several hours later when the opening shift arrive, one of the assistant managers (who I was a bit closer with) was one of them. I'll call him \"Erik.\"\n\nBy this point we were pretty much out of work we could reasonably do. So I filled Erik in on how that night started, and we shared some mutual hatred for Gary. I also filled him in on... it's a stretch to call it a 'plan', but more of a simple 'fact': I wasn't going to drive Gary home.\n\nI let Gary know we didn't have any more work we could really get done since the truck wasn't coming, and if he wanted he could clock out early and head home. He clocked out. Then puttered around in the break room, clearly waiting for me to offer him a ride home. That wasn't going to happen. I was pissed that I HAD to pick him up in order to get into the building without potentially ruffling any feathers for \"working in the building alone.\" I wasn't driving his lazy ass home. He's a grown adult. He could uber, he could take the 10 minutes to walk home, and when he gets home he could take off his wet shoes&amp;socks because he's at home now. We had plastic bags and rubber bands he could wrap over his shoes if he really felt like he needed them.\n\nBut I wasn't volunteering this information. I hit Erik up for any remotely busywork I could do to make it seem like I still had important shift manager stuff to do. Erik laughed along, and Gary killed time in the break room until I finally decided to head out.\n\nClocking out, he finally asked if I could give him ride home. To which he got a very blunt, \"No.\"\n\nBest part is... while the actual reason was sheer pettiness, the actual excuse I gave him was sound. The snow had kept coming down. I nearly got my car stuck on his unplowed road getting him several hours earlier. THAT was just annoying, but I wasn't getting my car stuck to take him home now. He could walk.\n\nI've got literally dozens of stories about Gary/William/Dimitri, one of the slowest, laziest, most incompetent, not to mention pointlessly pointlessly belligerent coworker/employees I've ever had. But 99% of the time I tried to remain as professional as possible.\n\nIt might have been just a simple \"No, I'm not giving you a ride,\" but this was that 1% time I was as petty and spiteful as possible about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Edit\\] \n\nSince several requested it, here's the story of \"I have this coworker, \"Gary.\" Gary's not his real name, it's William. He goes by Dimitri,\" I responded in the comments, but adding it here after the main story: \n\n\\[copypasta\\] Okay, so...\n\nThe overnights were originally me and \"Erik\". Erik got promoted, and needed to be on daytime shift more (there's a whole separate, much less interesting story about how the overnights got started at our store, they weren't supposed to be 'a thing'). So another shift manager started working the overnights with me.\n\nWhen it was concluded \"these are effective enough, lets make them an 7 day a week thing,\" we needed a new guy.\n\nThe first potential hire was named \"Gary.\" Older guy, seemed interesting. Went through the onboarding process, and then when the first night for him to start and get trained by us started, he called out.\n\nWe then got word the following morning that he had major family stuff go down, and couldn't start the job. We went through the whole process of hiring him... only to have him bail at the last second.\n\nSo the next new guy was \"New Gary.\" Except obviously he wasn't Gary, he was \"William.\"\n\nAnd more confusingly, he had his own nickname, \"Dimitri\" that he preferred to go by.\n\nObviously names changed... but they are EXACTLY that related to each other in real life. Something like \"William\" to \"Dimitri\".\n\nWe have no idea why he preferred that name, but we joked about him being some secret super USSR style communist spy (the real name was also very russian sounding.) We all kept referring to him as \"Gary\", because that's who he was in our head. \"Gary 2,\" but now actual Gary since \"Gary 1\" never actually worked with us. But tried to refer to him as \"William\" or \"Dimitri\" so as not to be jerks.\n\nBut we slipped up a lot and simply let him know \"Hey, if we ever call for 'Gary,' that's you.\" Never meant anything bad by it. Y'know, until he continuously pissed us off or merely aggravated us to the point where \"Gary\" became synonymously an insult. Like \"Karen\" except for horribly incompetent and slow workers rather than entitled bitches.  \\[endcopypasta\\]\n\nNot 'Bill' or 'Will', 'Dimitri.' No idea why. He didn't look of particularly Russian decent. Had some very 'normal' name (like John, or Jack, or, well, William) but didn't go by any nickname derivitive of his name. He preferred \\[extremely Russian name\\] for his nickname. \n\nBut we called him Gary. \n\nSay again, literally the only good thing about having worked with him, is that it cracks me up every time I begin a story and get to say, pretty much verbatim: \"I have this coworker, Gary. His name isn't really Gary, it's William. He goes by Dimitri.\" \n\nIt's not THAT complicated, but when that's the freaking intro to the story, you just see the person's brain have a minor short circuit behind their eyes as they try to follow that before settling into, \"Wait, I need to hear that again.\" ",

Well, Gary wasn't with us for very long but his legacy persists in the form of calling a \"Code Gary.\"\n\nYou see, one night Gary was working the 'bottleneck position' meaning that the rest of us could only go as fast as he did.  The manager was keeping an eye on him and decided to give him some motivation: work faster or work a different position.  Gary started an argument and got moved.\n\nHe was fuming as he stomped across the floor to the back of the area, and when he got there his new partner, not wanting to work in uncomfortable silence, asks \"You good?\"\n\nGary's response was, \"Yeah, I'm just thinking about all the people I'm gonna kill.\"  He was escorted out of the building and never came back... but for a good week or two, we were all worried that he would.",

The logic behind it is it isn't your problem your employer isn't prepared therefore you should bd paid for it, I only mention this because you said you lost pay due to this",

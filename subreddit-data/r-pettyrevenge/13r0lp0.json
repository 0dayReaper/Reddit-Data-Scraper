    "postText": "In college, one flat I had was right in Edinburgh's city centre, but still had open parking and it was a nightmare.\n\nOn one occasion I came to find my car blocked in by a double parked by an old delivery van of the kind typically used by corner shops to go to the cash n carry (wholesaler), not one I recognized as local, no evidence of the driver. It wasn't locked, and the keys were in it.\n\nSo I decided to play valet, and parked it in a pay and display space a couple of streets away and locked the keys inside. I did not pay for parking.\n\nWhen I got back from ny errand the space my car had been in by the flat was full and I had to park further down. Alas I never found out what happened.",

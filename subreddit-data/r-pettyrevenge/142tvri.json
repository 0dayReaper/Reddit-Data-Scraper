    "postText": "This is probably the one and only habit I took up and kept to this day just to be petty.\n\nSince we are here to enjoy some nice cup of good old petty tea and not for family drama, I won't go into the whole story about what a fine specimen of human garbage my stepfather(SF) is. But to give some summary for context: My mom and me coexisted in the same living space, but that was pretty much it when it came to the responsibilities of a \"caretaker\". When SF moved in in my early teen years things went to him actively bullying me out of their life quickly and she enabled him, so at 15 I packed my things and left.\n\nWe went no contact for some years, but in my 20's things developed in a direction where mom and me built up a somewhat friendly relationship. Not a mother-daughter one though - I had come to terms with her never taking on the role of a caretaker and always putting SF first. More like an aunt I see on family gatherings. \n\nAnd ohhh, the family gatherings. SF was as strong and despicable as ever: Not actively attacking me in front of the family, but making comments here and there under his breath that he knew I could hear, making toasts on how he was my mom's saviour out of her misery when everyone else left her (e.g. me) and so on. I am happy to say that with time, therapy and working on myself I am now able to not let it get to me anymore - the best revenge is a life well lived after all, and he's absolutely not worth the energy and negative emotions which only affect my well-being.\n\nI couldn't resist this one repeated act of pettyness though:   \nFor Christmas, of course my present is to them both as a couple and not only to my mom, as it would raise flag from the family. \"They\" always get some nice pralines, sometimes I bake a gorgeous cake (I love getting creative with cake decorating), one time I bought a really good red dessert wine (way to sweet for my taste, but my mom liked it very much). He's diabetic.",

This one time, in real life, a conservative radio talk show person who at one point said something like, \"Imprison all illegal drug users.\" and a bunch of other stupid stuff, suffered from hearing loss. I was thinking, \"Yay, The Lord is punishing them for the things they said!\" (Karma, the Lord, whatever, funnier to say the Lord with conservatives, right?)\n\n\nAnyway, get this, turns out they were \"Doctor Shopping\" to get prescription drugs, which violated the state's law. The kicker is that the drugs were making them deaf!",

At the next family gathering make a toast to independence and getting out of an abusive relationship you can style it in the form of breaking up with a boyfriend but just pointedly direct everything towards the SF. Everyone will understand what your talking about without actively insulting SF and if he does get offended you can just say its about the ex rather than him why is he being so defensive.",

    "postText": "I work from home. Receive a notification on my phone that my Amazon package has been delivered. It's a couple hundred dollar item so I immediately go outside but no package anywhere. I was outside as the delivery van was driving away so literally no way a package thief snatched it in 20 seconds. The Amazon driver is two houses down. \"Excuse me. I received notification that my package was just delivered but it's not there. \"\n\nDriver looking shocked stammering over words \"oh, uh, what's the address?\"\n\nGive him address. \n\n\"Yeah I just delivered it to you\"\n\n\"No you didn't. I'm calling Amazon and y'all can sort this out\" start walking away\n\nDriver calls out \"oh I found your package. But it says there's an issue and I can't deliver it. It's likely a duplicate and another driver will be by later to deliver the correct one\"\n\n\"Then why did you mark it as delivered\"\n\n\"Oh because I didn't see there was an error. The other driver will be by later\"\n\n\"No, I'm calling Amazon now\" walk away called Amazon to report the incident. \n\nThey say nothing is wrong with my package and it's marked as delivered. I tell them about the interaction and they say the driver should've given me the package. Even if it's a duplicate the driver is not supposed to withhold a package. They'll investigate and get back to me in 24 hours. \n\n2 minutes after getting off the phone with Amazon door bell rings. I happened to be next to the door so open it within 5 seconds to see the same delivery driver hauling ass down my driver. Jumps in delivery van and speeds off through the neighborhood. Look down and my package is there.\n\nCall Amazon again to let them know that I just got the package and it was the same driver who hauled tail. They said they would be opening an investigation into the driver. I also told them about how fast he was driving through the neighborhood. I felt like a Karen calling to complain but truly believe this driver was running a package stealing scam. Marks package as delivered, customer says they never received, driver says \"well a package thief probably stole it before you looked for it\".",

Do the delivery people have an accurate way to assess what is in a particular package? No point in stealing a gift set of hand creme, but good quality electronics definitely worth while.",

I used to do a pour over in the morning, but wanted a coffee machine that I could set up the night before and have a pot ready to go. \n\nFor the same price I could have gotten the Breville Precision, which has a butt ton more features (including the actual built in programable timer), but then I found someone selling a sealed new in box moccamaster locally for $140 under rrp, black with the thermal carafe which is the exact one I wanted.\n\nNow I have it hooked up to one of those digital outlet timers and it turns on at 6:30 ready for my wife to fill up her travel cup, and then stays warm until I get up at 8 to the whole house smelling of fresh brewed coffee I had to put no effort in to haha.",

What won me over to the Moccamaster was the copper heating coil, the reviews, the retro look, and that it is handmade in the Netherlands rather than on an assembly line in China.  It has easily replaceable parts and a five year warranty.  I've done the French press and the old school percolator and a Keurig but Moccamaster wins hands down.",

I always bagged obviously expensive stuff even when the system said it was fine to ship as-is for this very reason. Which is what the packers are supposed to do, but a lot are lazy and just want to ship it as fast as possible to keep their metrics high.",

Pretty easy to assess that's an expensive product.  I've noticed that a lot of products ordered on Amazon that are large no longer come in a shipping box, they just slap a shipping label on the product box and deliver it.  I ordered a Calphalon saute pan last week and it came like that.  Since the LEGO set was stolen I've since installed very visible security cameras around my property that cover every square inch.  Haven't had an issue with package theft since.",

No package.  Check Amazon tracking, shows a picture of the box on my steps but there's no box there.  It was a $700 LEGO set and the box on the outside very clearly said \"LEGO.\"  A set that big most people know is *very* expensive.  The driver very clearly stole the package.  Amazon made me file a police report before they would give me my money back.  Then a week later I got a nasty email basically saying, \"We noticed you have a high number of fraud claims.  If this continues your Amazon account will be permanently suspended.\"\n\nThat same week, security cameras installed all around my property so that I can see every inch in HD, with night vision, and they record continuously for a week.  I can view them and download any length of video that I want anywhere in the world.  Haven't had any package issues since then.\n\nedit: I've been an Amazon member since 1998 and a Prime member since they started Prime in 2005.  I have had over 100 orders every year for over a decade.  Until recently I never had any issues.  I've only ever had 30 returned items in over 20 years.  So to get an email like they sent me was total bullshit.  Instead of threatening one your most loyal customers maybe have some better screening during the hiring process and don't hire dickbag shithead thieves.",

Granted, the real jackass is the dipshit that decided when the property was built and registered to make the front house Unit B and our house in the back of the property Unit A like some kind of illiterate monster that's never seen the alphabet.\n\nWhat kind of security cameras did you get?

So even if packet thiefs were a thing here, which they are not, you could simply say you never received the package and get a refund, because if the delivery guy just placed it on your porch he sure as hell won't be having your signature. DHL, the package company of Deutsche Post, often tries to sign you up for a service where you give them the general permission to drop packages at certain places, like behind your dumpster or in your garage. I see that as a huge scam, because once you sign for that the burden of proof that you didn't get the package shifts to you, because the delivery guy can always say he placed it where you agreed to.",

The receipt had a random scribble for a signature, so I showed them my ID. They said that because it was a building, it was likely the Doorman's signature, so I should check with them. At that point I pulled my laptop out, and showed them the video and played it at 2.5x speed. The postman never showed up on the recording. They asked me for a copy of the video, and took my information down.\n\nA few days later, I get a call and was asked to go to the post office again. They had my package, which had been opened and asked me to review it. It was damaged, and pieces were clearly missing (Gundam model kit). They asked me for a proof of purchase, which I provided.

The package had fragile written all over it AND \"signature required upon delivery\".\n\nContacted the company I bought the frames from (because I still want non-broken ones) and we told them they needed to contact their courier service because throwing a package, especially one that has bright orange \"fragile\" stickers all over it, should not be acceptable.\n\nMy husband also caller the courier company to file a complaint. We were told that, because of covid, they aren't having people actually sign for packages, but instead write \"covid\" in the sign space. But what they're supposed to do is still knock and wait for an answer to confirm details, which this guy didn't.\n\nMy husband's brother jokingly called us Karens because of our complaints. I don't really think this is a Karen situation as they literally broke my items. I don't think what happened to you either was a Karen moment either. If you called to complain that they left it weird or something, that would be a Karen move. The courier tried to steal your package, that's totally different.",

    "postText": "This happened 15 years ago and I've never told anyone. \n\nI (16F) was dating a guy (22M) let's call him Predator cause he was one. Predator had a babymama, Maria (18F). Predator talked alot of shit about Maria and told me he broke up with her because she cheated. He supposedly found out because the guy she cheated with called Predator and told him. I assume to brag idk.\n\nSince they shared a child and Maria lived about an hour away, he'd visit his child once a month for an entire weekend. One weekend, he leaves his phone in her house. Maria starts texting me and was actually nice to me. However, I didn't see it like that at the time. Maria proceeded to tell me that Predator was a master liar and manipulator. She also said that she only cheated on Predator because he had cheated first. I (like am idiot) don't believe her. Predator doesn't mention anything I'm guessing because Maria deleted the messages. \n\nI start getting curious about Maria. She doesn't have social media so I don't know what she looks like. Predator's cousin was my best friend at the time. He tells me that Maria and I actually looked alot alike. I don't think much about it just assume Predator has a type. One weekend Maria comes into town. She goes to a house party I happen to be at too. My Bestie pointed her out to me. My jaw drops... \"looked alike\" was an understatement. Maria was my living and breathing DOPPELGANGER!!! Even Bestie was caught off guard because he didn't realize it until we were practically standing next to each other. I don't talk to Maria. I'm too uncomfortable and leave. \n\nI later find out that Predator showed up afterwards. Days later he ghosts me. Seriously, he changed his number. Bestie can barely look at me when I ask about Predator and gives me the \"Oh, idk I haven't talked to him either.\" Eventually I get Predator's number and confront him. He does a 180 and starts talking shit to me saying he's with Maria and to leave him alone because he never actually liked or cared about me. He gives me this whole speech basically making me feel like shit and used. Again, I'm 16 so I'm heartbroken and devastated.\n\nI later find out through Predator's cousin that Maria goes to the same niteclubs as I do. I use this as my advantage and come up with a plan. Bestie unknowingly helps me by telling me when Predator was in town and not with Maria. I also got Besties phone and wrote down Maria's number. \n\nFor 3 weeks straight, I dance and flirt with any guy who who is attracted to me. (Yes I know it was wrong cause I was a minor) When they ask for my number I give them Maria's number and on 3 occasions give them Predator's landline number. (Predator lived with his mom who hated Maria). Since Maria was my doppelganger I never feared being caught.\n\nBy the 4th week, Predator is calling and texting me saying he fucked up and wants to see me again. I can never forget the conversation we had when I asked about Maria. He said, \"Maria was still being a hoe. She had dudes calling and texting blowing up her phone saying they met at (name of niteclubs). My mom even said she must've been drunk cause she received late night calls from men asking for Maria. She says it wasn't her but i dont believe her. So yeah she cheated on me.\" To which I replied, \"Damn, that's crazy.\"\n\n..........................\n\n\n\n....................\n\n\n\n\n...............\n\n\n\n..........\n\n\nEdit: Alright, some of you guys think I saved Maria. I really didn't, although I wish I did. I deleted the aftermath cause I found it sad, but I might as well tell you guys since I've already spilled my 15 year secret. \n\nWhat happened after?  \n\nI had to stop my friendship with Bestie (Predator's cousin) to completely detach myself from Predator. However, when I was about 25 we got in contact again and caught up with each other. I found out through Bestie that Predator and Maria did get back together  and were together for a few years.\n\nHowever, they both ended up getting Chlamydia. They pointed fingers at each other, accusing the other of cheating and passing the STD. Bestie said Predator was sleeping around but denied it to Maria. Somehow, one of Maria's family members told Predator that Maria had been having sex with other men for money. Yes, she became a prostitute or escort. I'm not sure of the proper word rn.\n\nSince Bestie and Maria were friends, he asked her if it was true. Maria admitted it and said she did it because Predator wouldn't provide enough money for her and their son. Predator was basically a fucking bum who couldn't hold down a job. Maria was introduced to the \"sex work\" (again, not sure if it's a proper word) through a friend. Maria felt like it was easy and fast money. Maria and Predator do end up breaking up again due to the discovered STD. I'm not sure if it was permanent this time, let's hope it was. \n\nSo, why couldn't she leave Predator?\n\nGuys, she was 16 when he impregnated her. I met Predator at 15 (nearly a year before said revenge), so he clearly liked young girls. Predator right? Im assuming it was easier for him to control teenagers than woman his age who could see through his facade. I'm telling you when I say Predator was a MASTER in lying and manipulation. To this day I realize so much of the fucked up shit I put up with thinking it was \"normal\" when it wasn't.\n\n I know now as an adult that my revenge was wrong but in many ways I WISH it would've saved Maria. I didn't want to add this detail because I felt it was sad. However, I also feel like it'd be wrong of me to pretend like I did her a favor. \n\nI hope in the bottom of my heart that Maria escaped the Pied Piper forever and that she's now with someone who loves and respects her. Thanks for reading guys.",

    "postText": " I recently attended a friend\u2019s wedding a few hours away from home and the gf and I decided to get an airbnb so she could bring her dog. We found a nice place that allowed pets, took off early from work and arrived Friday late afternoon. About 30 minutes later, the owner shows up to see how we\u2019re doing while we have the dog on the porch. We make some small talk, and he mentions that we didn\u2019t indicate we were bringing a dog. I felt bad, as it was an honest mistake, and I\u2019d never lie to someone to get out of paying the pet fee. We tell him that and offer to pay the $25 fee on the spot. He refuses to take the money, and says that he loves dogs and eventually heads out. We don\u2019t think too much else about it, but when we leave, we decide to give the place a much more thorough cleaning than was in the instructions. The dog didn\u2019t chew any furniture or leave any other damage or mess, at least that we didn\u2019t clean up. \n\nIn our minds the trip was a success and the Airbnb was a great fit. I got the email from them to leave a review and I left a 5 star review and said the house and the owner were great. But then I saw his review of me, and a private message where he blasted me for not telling him that I was bringing a dog, how dogs causes them so much more work, and how we shouldn\u2019t leave dogs alone in the house. This didn\u2019t sit well with me at all, since I thought we had handled this person to person when he came by on the first day. I was, and still am happy to pay for the pet fee, and there was no indication anywhere on the posting that we couldn\u2019t leave the dog alone for a few hours while we were at a wedding, nor did he say that while we chatted and told him we were here for a wedding. For him to post that on my Airbnb profile felt like a cheap shot. \n\nI responded to him that in the chat and said as much, and while Airbnb couldn\u2019t do anything about the review since it didn\u2019t violate any of their policies, my gf did point out that hosts aren\u2019t supposed to show up to the property unannounced. I had no idea and figured this was his property and he is allowed to show up, at least to check in with the guests. Normally I wouldn\u2019t care, especially since it was a very cordial interaction, but since he took a cheap shot with my review, I decided to do the same. I reached out to Airbnb support to tell them about his unannounced visit, and they forwarded it to their security team. I answered a few questions about the interaction, and they spoke to him. A week or so later they let me know that he was in violation of their policy, and they refunded me 2/3 days of the stay, which came out to about $200. All because of a bad review.",

That looks like skid marks from the bottom of the coffee pot\u201d \n\nIt was. They didn\u2019t apologize. \n\nWe don\u2019t even drink coffee. Lol",

Those are able to be cleaned and the Sharpie schmutz should wipe off with a tissue and maybe some rubbing alcohol. I usually will take a marker and rather than write directly over where the Sharpie marks are, I'll scribble over a larger area and erase it quickly while the dry erase is still fresh. It'll take away the scribbles I made and the extra that's not directly on the Sharpie will chip away at it. Scribble more, erase more, and continue. Scribbling off of the Sharpie will help clean the tip of the marker so that the next time you use it, it should be clean and fresh. Definitely best to try to match the color of the marker as best you can, tho. Any color dry erase will work but orange on black will definitely make a bit of a mess.\n\nSource: I used to collect dry erase markers and Sharpies. I still have two shoeboxes full of Sharpies but at my best I had in excess of 700 in four full shoeboxes.",

There is sort of a 'landlord' to the barracks who does assignment and inspections and what not, and yeah you get charged for damaged.\n\nMy roommate and i both were checking out (deployment) and so we had the same inspection day essentially done as a pair, not separate appointments.\n\nAs our guy (a 65ish year old retired first sergeant, kinda known for their hardass nature) is walking around checking things, he comes across a huge sploot of boogers on the wall by my bed.\n\nLike a stringy fuckin snot that was dried and caked to the wall, greenish brown and just literally shaped like a thick mucousy sneeze.\n\nSo first sergeant starts grilling me, just absolutely disgusted and angry how gross i am, just treating me like a piece of crap. Now on one hand, they deal with a lot of 18 year olds who don't know how to wipe their ass because they are mommys little boys. And on the other hand, holy hell he was being a complete dick to me, like god damn for an accidental booger blast? My roommate was pretty disgusted but amused. So i'm told get this cleaned or i'll let your unit know you're the filthy one.\n\nI'm so embarrassed i don't even feel anger. I don't remember sneezing boogers like that? Its like 2 inches, what is wrong with me, i am the gross private giving us a bad name? I run to get something to wipe and hot water, i run to go wipe the boogies down. I walk up and start scrubbing and...\n\nIts 2 dimensional and not crusty. Its not coming off, it doesn't seem right for boogers?\n\nWell, it was a scrape in the paint, and only just a scrape in the paint.\n\nGuess what color drywall paper is? Kinda just olive ish brown is... colored like a dark booger.\n\nAnd if anyone is wondering, no big sarnt didn't apologize or have anything to say, lol.",

We thought we were getting a good rate of 200 per night, but after cleaning fees and taxes, it was 350 per night.  At that rate you're in a 5-star hotel.  We'll think twice about airbnb next time.",

Then, after renting a place for six days and paying for it in full, it just vanished from the site about a week before I was set to arrive. I had no way to contact the owner for the address, and my rental was coming up.\n\nI contacted VRBO, and they said a legitimate listing (ie not a scam), but VRBO took the listing down off the site. Why? \"can't tell you that\". Can you give me the owner's contact info? \"can't tell you that\". Can you pass my info on to the owner, and get them to contact me? \"can't do that\". \n\nSo what CAN you do? \"Show up (in Toronto) on the day scheduled. We won't do anything for you before then, because the owner MIGHT contact you. If they don't, call us when once you're in the city, and we'll see about getting you set up in another place\"\n\nThat, my friends, is not a plan I was happy with.\n\nTook a lot of phoning, pleading, and outright begging before the fourth or fifth employee told me, \"well, I'm really not supposed to do this, but here...\" \n\nShowed up at the address, and had a good stay.\n\nSwitched to AirBnb for our next rental, and have had great customer service with them on the rare occasion it was needed. Haven't looked back.\n\n**TL;DR**:  VRBO and AirBnB really have the same product. It's like comparing Coke and Pepsi; minor difference, some have their preferences. But I found AirBnB's customer service to be waaaaay better\n\nSide note: once I got the address, I googled it and discovered why VRBO took it down off their site. Seems a week prior, a bunch of people rented it out for a massive party, and there was a double murder in the house. Ok, I see why they took down the rental. But either tell me the address, or refund my payment.",

As we looked around we saw there were significant cracks in around the windows, etc where they had to be getting in. During the stay we contacted the owners to ask if there was anything we could do to help as having these bugs literally fall on us while we were trying to relax was less than relaxing. They were dismissive with an \u201cit\u2019s in the mountains\u201d response. We ended up leaving a day early because we couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \n\nWe still left them a five star review because they had communicated well before the stay and other than the bugs, the cabin was nice. Then we get our review with four stars for \u201ccommunication.\u201d What?! We literally responded to them within less than an hour every time we spoke, made ourselves available on their timeline for a pre-booking interview and left the place in immaculate condition. I guess they took telling them something they didn\u2019t like as poor communication. \n\nHindsight\u2026I didn\u2019t feel the property deserved five stars but didn\u2019t want to affect their standing so just left a detailed review mentioning the bugs but glowing about everything else. I won\u2019t make that mistake again, I\u2019ll be honest yet fair.",

Cleaned up like crazy.  Left the place spotless.  Owner asked us to strip the beds and \"put the sheets on the floor\" of the laundry room.  I did that, except I put them in the laundry basket instead, thinking it was nicer.  Last step to cleaning was putting everything in the dishwasher and started it up as we walked out the door... otherwise our breakfast dishes would have been left dirty.\n\nShe asked us to review and we gave 5 stars and happy words.  She instantly hit us with 4 and said \"could improve\".\n\nI can't even imagine what that meant????  I treated the home like my own and you couldn't tell that anybody had spent the weekend - just 2 old folks and a dog.\n\nIf I do home-share again it won't be VRBO. I don't want to start off with a bad impression.\n\nEdit to add - I kind of resented the cleaning since these places charge a HUGE cleaning fee. I mean, when I stay at the Hyatt, I walk out with my stuff. I don't clean.  The price I pay to spend the night covers their staff and cleaning teams.\n\nThis is one reason I really prefer to stay a Hyatt than a home-share.  If I wanted to spend the weekend cleaning I could stay home.",

I\u2019d have to set my alarm for 6am to get myself ready and spring clean the house by the 10am checkout. The last one I seriously considered demanded that guests start the laundry for sheets, pillowcases, towels, etc. all dishes had to be put away after running the dishwasher, floors swept, surfaced scrubbed, trash taken out to the main bin, ... Plus cleaning fee of $150 for two nights and a pretty rude message that I\u2019d be charged extra if all the cleaning wasn\u2019t done. I booked a hotel and enjoyed a stress-free morning. I always try to be respectful and tidy up but I was stressing and kept having to revisit the app to make sure we\u2019d finished the whole chore list before we left the last one.",

I suppose it could have all been a ruse to vet their guests, but it felt genuine and like they just wanted to make sure the house was stocked with everything we needed for the weekend. No cameras needed for them to see their guests, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were completely unaware of the \"no surprise visits\" rule.\n\nThat being said, if they had a problem in the moment I would hope they try to resolve it on the spot rather than waiting to leave a lower review.",

I stayed at an airbnb a while back and the owner appeared out of nowhere the first day we arrived, I assume to make excuses for the poor state the location was in and try to apologize for the misleading images online that made it seem quaint and cozy. He also apologized ahead of time for the construction that was being done on his property, and insisted it wouldn't disturb us.\n\nI ended up taking photos of everything that was amiss, like the gaps between the floor and the door to the front yard(this made me feel so unsafe), the tons of spiders, the inability to open the fridge door because the cabinets across from it were too close, the lack of curtains in the bathroom in a very tight knit neighborhood, and the bug bites I woke up with every morning. Construction was ongoing every day starting at 8am, often with very loud drills and power tools (also heard the construction workers discussing the event we were attending and insulting the people who were attending the event, degrading them. It was a nerd event, but come on).\n\nI tried making a complaint to Airbnb once we got home, as I was genuinely uncomfortable with the owner showing up unannounced initially and was worried what he might do if I tried to bring up all these issues in person. Because we had no photo evidence of there being bugs in the beds(even though I had photo proof of the bites themselves), and we didn't address the insane list of issues to the owner before the first night, Airbnb said they could only give us a refund on the cleaning fee(Less than $50).\n\nIf I'd known he wasn't allowed to show up unannounced I could have perhaps explained to Airbnb that that was my reasoning for not initially discussing the issues with the location. It was a weeks stay, it cost a lot. Alas, I'll at least know for next time!",

            "comment": "My partner and I were staying in a rental where the owner randomly showed up. We had a big day; got up early to ride a hot air balloon and spent the rest of the day enjoying the local sights. Cannabis is legal where we were so we had acquired some products that we consumed after our big day. We were just relaxing when there was a knock on the door. I was a little too \"in the weeds\" at this point and absolutely did not want to answer the door. But we were basically staying in the owner's backyard and I didn't want to make my partner answer as she was in the same condition as me. So I answered the door and the very nice owner asked how our day went. I tried my best to make full sentences and reasonably communicate the highlights of our day, feeling like I was doing a terrible job. He went on to say that he just wanted to stop by to give us a treat that he made us, which was a yogurt/fruit dish that was made with honey from his bee hives, and wished us goodnight. I came back in carrying these treats and being very concerned that the owner didn't think very highly of me, being in the state I was in. My partner, on the other hand, was thrilled for the treat and assured me that she overheard us chatting and that it sounded like a normal human conversation. This was many years ago and she still brings up how much she enjoyed that treat and appreciated the owner's hospitality. I'm not a fan of people just showing up but this was a wholesome moment that I think fondly of and came from an unannounced visit from a rental host.",

Had a group of guys rent a cabin for a weekend on Airbnb. The host tried to charge an extra $50 because the cleaners told them there was dog hair everywhere. We left the place spotless. And\u2026there was no dog.  I suspect it was the cleaner trying to make an extra few bucks. The drawback for me is the huge unknown of how the owner (or cleaner) will react when you check out. Since then I\u2019ve treated STRs like rental cars. I walk around and inspect as soon as I check in. It\u2019s not the way I want to start my vacation.",

My eldest sister was to stay on the fold out couch by herself which I stated during the booking process. I assumed, going off of the listing photos and details, that the fold out would be a full size. Upon our arrival to the Airbnb, we found that the couch was only half opened up making it a single instead. I contacted the host and apologized for not having disclosed that my sister is bigger in size and around 5'11\" and not realizing that only half of the couch would be set up. Before they responded, I sent a follow up message stating that we would set up the other half, we just needed to know where the additional sheets were as well as asking about the location of the fans they said would be available for use. I received a frantic message back asking us to NOT touch the fold out and that she'd already contacted her cleaning guy to come back over and set it up as a full, but that we'd be charged an extra 25$ for his return trip and could pay him directly. I responded quickly saying that we did not have any physical money on hand and would just go without the additional bed set up and instead swap our original sleeping arrangements, promising to leave the couch as it was. She then said he was already on his way and we could just pay her through the Airbnb app. It took a few more back and forth messages and me pointing out that she did not disclose the extra fee for her cleaning guys return before sending him along/hearing back from me before she relented and said they'd pay him for the extra stop. The best part is that when he walked through the door, he was holding the two fans they had specifically said were available at their property. It seems he would have had to return in order to drop off the fans even without the additional bed set up.",

When they got there it smelled really bad, and there were all these pornographic images on the walls like art. Not a big deal as they really just needed a place to crash. I can\u2019t remember how they decided to look in the oven but they realized the source of the smell was coming from a several days old full sized burnt turkey. My husband went to set his stuff down on the bed, and kicked a can. He looked under the bed to find a treasure trove of beer cans stuffed under there. But it gets better\u2026\n\nThere was a MIL suite in the backyard being rented out by other tenants. About 2 hours after they get there, there was a knock at the door. It was a drug dealer coming to deliver some goods to the tenants in the back. They contacted the Airbnb host to explain what was going on, and she offered to remove the cleaning fees ($50). My husband suggested they bring all of their belongings into the house, since obviously this wasn\u2019t your average Airbnb and was feeling a bit uneasy. His one friend neglected to do so, and the next morning someone had hopped the fence and stolen his fishing rods out of the boat AND tried to unattached the trailer. \n\nThey recontacted the host and asked about cameras (they had none of course) and expressed their distaste and concern. The host didn\u2019t have much to say. \n\nLater on - she gave them a five star review and my husband just couldn\u2019t bring himself to return the favor so he left her a 3 star review explaining what happened. They lady lashed out at him with physical threats, and couldn\u2019t understand why he left her the honest review. And this is why I don\u2019t stay at airbnbs. \n\nSomehow they disputed this with Airbnb and ended up getting almost all of their money back. This was a couple years ago",

They said yes, with a fee but i later noticed they forgot to charge the fee.\n\nDuring the stay i had glass lodge itself in my hand that was in a dining chair and found a shard in a bed. There was dog poop encrusted in the carpet in the upstairs loft. It was hot af and no ac so I shrugged and didn't go up there...other issues too but honestly i shrugged them off. It was one of those places that was nice from a birds eye view but things were wrong at closer inspection.\n\nOn my 3rd night, the dogs second (they arrived a day later), I was messaged at midnight with shock at the dogs, and being told i had to pay a $250 fee (previously it was 50/dog for 100 they forgot to charge) and reneging a previously arranged late checkout.  I didn't see this at the time or even for a few weeks after because it was sent at midnight...and I was busy the next day.\n\nGot a call the next day asking when i was leaving and was confused but was gonna head to the airport soon anyways.\n\nAfter leaving I was accused of bringing dogs that weren't allowed and that they had peed on both couches and they wanted $320 for cleaning.  But the dogs were never left alone once.\n\nIt took over a month of back and forth with Airbnb to get them to drop the claim. I used pictures of the listing that were near identical with what i took upon checkout (that i took because of the call i received) Initially they dropped only one couch and still pursued for another, showing wear and tear but nothing from dogs... literally just old cushions. I had to point that out a further 3 times before they finally apologized and said they wouldn't pursue damages.\n\nDuring all of this I decided to make a claim against the cleanliness of the Airbnb and was returned my cleaning fee and only 30% of the first night. So you made out better but damn if the whole situation isnt frustrating as hell.\n\nI'm still trying to get the review removed considering it's just full of verifiable lies.\n\nI'm also a host, just a room, and had someone claim their dog was service dog and when it showed up was very clearly a yappy emotional support Chihuahua. We otherwise don't host dogs because we have 2, so they got past our no dog filter and also didn't pay a fee. Good times.",

That is something you double, triple, and quadruple check.\n\nThe only reason you wouldn't do it is to not pay the fee.  OPs plan was probably to bring the dog and if the owner didn't see, great - he saved some money. If called out, he would just act oblivious and pay.\n\nPeople think they are slick, but ***ANYONE*** that has worked in the service industry will be able to tell you that they've heard the same excuse and plan carried out a thousand times. The whole \"But I would totally pay if I only knew!\" thing is the weakest and most transparent play ever.",

    "postText": "EDIT because a lot of people are missing relevant points and acting all offended on behalf of this dude's poor telephone: This was not a cold call campaign. It was business to business technical training courses. It was not an aggressive dialer, it would only call once per day. This guy went to the website, filled out all his info and typed (in a free text field) a request for which courses his company needed. Then, when we tried to call him to get his requested training booked, he ignored the first three attempts and told me my family should die on the fourth call attempt. My response was petty, and yes, I'm the asshole here too. There's absolutely no excuse for this guy's behavior other than that he's a shitty human being, and my only regret in the story is that I didn't find out what company he was requesting training courses for, and let his HR and/or supervisor know what a shitty human being he was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now to our story:\n\nA number of years ago, in the midst of a career change I ended up working in a few call centers. I get it, those calls suck, and the autodialers were pretty aggressive for some clients, but for the campaign I was on when our story happens, all of the leads we were calling had directly requested info - we weren't making any cold calls or working off purchased lead lists.\n\nOne afternoon, I got connected to a call that had picked up, and this guy was so infuriated by his precious telephone ringing that he thought it would be appropriate to tell me \"I hope your whole family dies in a fiery car wreck tonight.\"\n\nY'all...\n\nI ignored a lot of asshole responses at that job - I don't like getting robocalled either. I might even have responded in a less nuclear manner to this dude if I hadn't recently become a dad; \"your whole family\" set me off a little.\n\nI bit my tongue hard, and hung up on him. I wrote down his info. We had a lot of it - his phone number, email, physical address, because he wasn't even just a passing ad-click, he had actually filled out the entire form requesting info on specific training courses. I took a break to calm down before I finished my shift. Then that night I spent a couple of hours online signing him up for literally everything I could find didn't require a credit card number, especially things I thought might offend his obvious \"tough guy\" persona.\n\nMagazines. Samples. Subscription trials. Religions. Consultation requests for penis enlargement, breast enlargement, breast reduction. Drugs for any embarrassing or sexually transmitted disease I could think of. A couple dozen insurance quotes. A few sketchy-looking sites that I felt confident would sell the shit out of the info. Oh, and requests on all of the most aggressive cold-call robodialer campaigns the company operated (beauty school and medical transcription were the highest dial rate and the worst to get off the list for). I like to think he needed a PO box and a new phone number within a week or two in order to function.",

During a recession my husband was out of work, off and on, for 18 months. During that time Drs made a significant error and I nearly died. Twice. And we still got stuck with nearly $100k in medical debt to the hospital that employed said Drs. He worked some shitty jobs for some shitty people to keep us homed and fed and pay for the health insurance. Moral outrage for these companies? Anger even at telemarketers who refuse to shut up? Sure. Wishing actual death on a stranger's family because you're annoyed or being okay with that happening? Just gonna say I'm glad you aren't who I come home to at night and I feel bad for those who do. \n\nPSA, for anyone going through anything even slightly similar - Those were hard years, very hard, but we made it through. We now live in our dream house and have a wonderful life together. I'm still disabled, in part due to those mistakes, but hubby's working his dream engineering job.

    "postText": "I want to apologize right away for my English, because I am not from an English-speaking country. I hope everything will be understandable)\r  \n\r  \nI used to work in a cab and a rather unpleasant guy sat down with me and the final address was quite non-standard, so I easily remembered it. All the way he was changing asking somewhere to stop, and when I explained that no I can not start shouting, insulting me, etc. And then, on the way to his address, we picked up some girl (I thought it was his girlfriend). In the end, when we arrived, he refused to pay and threw some hurtful words. I let it go and forgot, I thought, but stuff happens and why get upset.\r  \nBut three days later, I got an order for the same address. I thought it was just a coincidence and it could not be him again because the city is very large and such a coincidence is unlikely. And so I sat down, a very nice polite girl sat down and almost the entire trip arguing with her boyfriend on the phone, and when she was done talking to me, she turned to me and said. \"Why are all men such assholes? I try for him, and she can't even get a job. And at this point I tell her that I recently drove a very unpleasant guy to this address, and she heard it and said his name, and I realized that it was him, because on the first trip when that girl got in the car, she said his name. And what do you think, I told this girl everything. That her boyfriend was driving with another girl to their house. He didn't have any sisters or girlfriends, like his girlfriend said. So we decided to check it out, we exchanged contacts and met her a few days later. She told her boyfriend she was going to be late or not coming at all, and in the meantime we were standing outside her house for about 4 hours waiting to see if anyone was coming to see him. And guess what? The same girl who was driving with him showed up. You should have seen the anger and disappointment on that girl's face when she saw it.   But I was glad I had taught him a lesson and helped the girl finally realize what a jerk her boyfriend really was.",

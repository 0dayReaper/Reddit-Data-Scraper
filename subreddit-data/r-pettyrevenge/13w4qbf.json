    "postText": "When I was 13 I was routinely bullied on the train on the way home from high school. I was a bit nerdy with thick glasses and very shy and socially awkward. This girl was from another more affluent school that used the same train. She was mean, cruel and humiliating and I dreaded the trip. I of course will never forget her.\n\nFast forward 20 years. I am now a veterinarian and look quite different. One day I have a consult with...my old bully and her dog. I instantly recognized her. She has no clue who I am. Let me stress I would never harm an animal or cause any suffering because of my feelings towards an owner. Ever, but. . Her dog did end up requiring shampoos, admission to a weight monitoring program, regular weight check ups, regular dental check ups, dietary supplements etc perhaps a bit more frequently than necessary.  \n\nIt can be expensive to be a bully.",

In your original post you indicated that her dog ended up REQUIRING (various treatments) perhaps a bit more frequently than necessary.\n\nBut in your comment that I\u2019m replying to, you said you\u2019re simply providing the best care to this dog, careful and detailed. So are you saying that you are giving this owner BETTER care than other dogs? Because it is different apparently as you are doing it more frequently than necessary.\n\nAlso would you not consider this to be fraud, since you use the word required but you also said it was done more frequently than necessary? And given the secondary gain for you, does this not seem like rationalizing the extra treatment that wasn\u2019t necessary? Is this in line with reflecting integrity in your profession? Do you have other reasons when you may recommend more treat than is necessary, besides when it provides you an opportunity to exact revenge on what a teenager did 20 years ago?\n\nAnd, in your profession, does your fiduciary duty include respecting the autonomy of pet owners? And assuming it does, would causing the owner to believe treatment was required, when said treatment by your description was more frequently than necessary, thus deprive the owner of making an informed decision, and thus deprive the owner of autonomy in the care process? Would that not be contrary to your regulatory body\u2019s rules?\n\nAnd does bragging about overcharging an owner in order to enact revenge on them, not being your discipline into disrepute? Is this something you would proudly announce to colleagues, or to your professional regulatory?\n\nIt is people who understand fiduciary duty in professions where a higher standard of integrity is expected, who are having a problem with this post.",

What if any of that is the same for this dog? \n\nThis is bullshit because it involves an animal. \n\nThe extra visits and extra money may cause the family stress, and the dog is the source of that. Dogs are incredibly perceptive. So don\u2019t pretend it can\u2019t impact the animal, a vet should know better. \n\nScrew OP for doing this. I am hard no on anything that can make things hard for the animal. Getting downvotes but I don\u2019t care, it needs to be said. A vet is a position of trust. Would it be okay if it was a dentist and OP made the person\u2019s child gave extra dental visits? Some kids like dental visits, some not, but should be okay right, just give the dentist more money and kid has better teeth, enemy is a little poorer and had to go to some extra appointments, so no harm, right? Absolutely not, we all know it, and this is no different.",

Thanks for diagnosing my dog as a neurotic mess, as well as telling me that giving up Reddit is a quick solution. Guess all dogs just come to people happy and well adjusted huh? \n\nDid you ever consider that a dog can look happy and still feel stress at the same time? Yes your dog can live your vet, but do you think your dog doesn\u2019t know that other animals are going in and they\u2019re distressed? How about the awful times when you\u2019re there while someone is saying goodbye. We are empathetic and greatly affected when we experience that in the waiting room - is your dog without the ability to empathize? \n\nEven if you have that remarkable animal that is so perfectly adjusted to never feel any stress at the vet, it\u2019s not guaranteed for all dogs. It\u2019s not the absence of harm that\u2019s the issue, it\u2019s the potential for it. Like you don\u2019t say oh it\u2019s okay to not wear seatbelts because I didn\u2019t get in an accident before, you wear it in case you do. You minimize unnecessary treatments because of the potential harm and distress, despite the fact that some people may thrive on it. \n\nHave you ever done anything that might annoy someone? What if it turns out I was your doctor and I took issue with you dissing me about my dog parenting abilities, so decided to take some petty revenge on you by telling you your medical condition required you to take medicine you needed to pay for, that you could well have done without, and that you need to visit the clinic more frequently than is necessary, to undergo treatments that maybe you don\u2019t totally need, this costing you time and money?\n\nMaybe you like your doctor, but even if you do, would being told to go there frequently be totally stress free? \n\nSince animals pick up emotions from their owners, it would be stressful for the dog if the owner worries about the dog needing so much vet care. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard once you\u2019ve dug into a position, but bottom line is that this is firstly plain and simple fraud by someone in a profession that\u2019s expected to be above this for a reason, and secondly it simply is incredibly unlikely to be zero impact on the dog, and this vet has no way of ensuring that\u2019s the case. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s wrong.",

You need to learn more about animal behavior so you can fix your dog, and that\u2019s more about identifying it\u2019s triggers and modifying your behavior. Example, projection and the vet\u2026.chew bubble gum. It helps to mask your anxiety. Have your vet and staff greet your dog outside and then they go away and you go home. Couple of times after that, dog goes inside gets loves and treats from them and everyone goes away again. Repeat. Now dog is ready for exam and after, bring him right back so he only gets the love and treats. It works. If you are interested in getting him to love a car ride, pm me and I\u2019ll help you make that happen.

They\u2019re so busy too that I\u2019m not sure they would give extra time. She doesn\u2019t care much for the groomers, but she loves the guy who cleans her teeth. \n\nAs far as car rides go, it also has to do with motion sickness so again not the kind of thing where there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to train that out, we can walk to most things, just not the vet. \n\nI get maybe you\u2019re being lighthearted saying less time on Reddit more time with pup etc., but it implies that I should give up time I spend on me and devote that time to my dog. Now maybe you\u2019re the one making assumptions? How much time do I spend with my dog, how much on my own interests, and what is the best proportion for me, since it was your suggestion I spend less time on Reddit and more on teaching my dog? That just came across as kind of rude and insulting, but maybe you didn\u2019t mean it that way, as your last comment sounded kinder and less judgmental. \n\nLook, it\u2019s because I care about dogs that I rook issue with this post. Of course there are near perfect dog owners with near perfectly adjusted dogs who are perfectly happy and zero stress each time they go to the vet. But many aren\u2019t, and that\u2019s a fact. It\u2019s one thing to instruct people how to avoid this, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that many dogs experience stress at the vet and this dog could be one of them. This veterinarian admits to vengefully recommending more treatments than necessary for the dog, with is unethical and could be causing distress one way or another, in the event the dog and owner are not said perfectly adjusted individuals, or if the stress of the time or financial burden of the extra, more-than-necessary treatment has a negative impact in if the pooch is the perceived cause of same (I would never blame my animal for needing care, but hey, this vet has told us how terrible this person is). \n\nI commented negatively about this because it\u2019s unethical, admittedly fraudulent with financial benefit to the vet, and it has some reasonable chance of harming or distressing the dog. That\u2019s not okay IMO. And also IMO it\u2019s dangerous to encourage a vet to act unethically in this manner. \n\nGuess most people on here figure that chance is minimal enough to justify someone getting back at what a teenager did 20 years ago. I don\u2019t.",

And the impact on the family, financially and time-wise, caused by the dog, can still negatively impact the dog. \n\nAs far as humans go it would be an incredible breach of ethics for a clinician to recommend treatment more frequently than necessary, just for the sake of revenge. The fact that OP has financial gain from this also makes it plain and simple fraud. OP is admitting to recommending treatment more often than is necessary, and thus financially benefiting, at the expense of the customer, from this dishonesty.\n\nClinicians are supposed to recommend based on their training, experience, examination, results of testing, and observations, only what is necessary. All recommendations should be weighed risks vs. anticipated benefit, and first and foremost consider the patient\u2019s best interests, except in the case of research, where the patient is explicitly advised of the goal of treatment as being primarily for research purposes, treatment second. The fact that the patient can\u2019t talk, isn\u2019t human, shouldn\u2019t allow the vet to be unscrupulous. \n\nI\u2019m actually surprised this person is a vet, because, at least in my country, they would be taught how egregious this behaviour is. Dunno, maybe they come from a country where vets aren\u2019t as regulated/aren\u2019t held to as high of an ethical standard.\n\nAll I can say is, celebrating this behaviour is a slippery slope indeed, because OP has crossed a line in a relationship based on trust, where there needs to be a high standard to ensure wellbeing of the animals. What comes next - someone cut them off in the parking lot so their pet needs more treatment? Maybe their political views don\u2019t align? It\u2019s just wrong.",

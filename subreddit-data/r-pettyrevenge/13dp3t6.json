    "postText": "I had an altercation with my jerk of a neighbor..\n\n\n\nThe Backstory: I bought my first house last winter, and moved into it last March, so I've been here just over a year. This house shares a private drive with several other houses. The residents of our private driveway would collectively pay for snow removal, but this year the company that provided that service has stopped. The reason they will no longer service our private drive is the jerk neighbor would park his truck in a way that made it impossible for them to remove the snow without hand shoveling.. This meant this winter we had to hand shovel the private drive ourselves.\n\n\n\nThree times this winter myself any all of my neighbors(Including a 75+ year old man who has no business being outside shoveling snow) hand shoveled the entire private drive, all except for jerk that is. On one occassion right as we finish shoveling jerk drives out the freshly shoveled driveway without even looking at us.\n \n\n\nAs I understand it jerk doesn't care about snow removal because he has a truck. According to him his truck can get over snow fine, so he shouldn't have to pay for snow removal.. Another thing that really irks me about this jerk is he apparently he bullies the elderly neighbor on our private drive.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week I cut the grass, and took the yard waste to the end of the driveway and dumped it 6 feet from the curb where the city comes to collect it. Last night I'm taking out the recycling and jerk is at the end of the driveway in his truck. He says hello, and then asks me going forward to move my yard waste 100 feet further away from the driveway, because it's killing HIS grass. I say the grass died there because the city took 2 months to come and collect it last time. He says he moved it for me this time, and it's then that I notice that my pile of yard waste was moved an extra 100 feet further away. \n\n\n\nYou see I'm not always the best at dealing with spur of the moment confrontation, I walked away at that point. I was livid, I felt like a coiled spring ready to snap, but I thought for a minute, calmed down, and made a plan. I got home and told my GF to start the car and pick me up at the end of the driveway(we were on our way out), I had more to say to jerk.\n\n\n\nI walk back to the end of the driveway where jerk is still waiting, I say \"I'm going to leave the yard waste there, because that is where the city comes to collect it. \" as I point to the spot where I initially left it. I continue \"If there is a problem with that, you can have the owner of the house contact me\". He immieditely goes \"I'm the owner\", and I cut him off with \"As I understand it, you're a renter, is that correct?\". He nods his head. I say \"Thats fine, just have the owner contact me about anything, I actually need to talk to the owner about snow removal so it would be great to talk to him\", as I start walking away. He says \"wait just talk to me\", and I go \"No thanks, I'm only interested in talking to the owner\". At that point my GF made it to the end of the driveway and picked me up, and we drove off. \n\n\n\nAt this point I felt vindicated, its essentially the end of the story, but I noticed something odd when we came home later that night that gave me an extra kick of laughter.. When we are pulling into the driveway I notice that the pile of yard waste was moved back to the initial spot, which implies jerk actually moved it twice... \n\n\n\nNote: Technically the area I left the yard waste in isn't jerk's property, it isn't the owners property either, it's the cities. The city maintains the grass about 8 feet from the curb, I'm confident that land is technically theirs, meaning jerk was wrong anyway.",

Isn't blocking someone from leaving a crime?\n\nThe benefit of this route is that we can technically charge him for snow removal. If he doesn't want to pay the 100$ I think we can put a lien on the house.. A lien over a mere 100$ sounds even more amusing than blocking him in :)",

I'm not 100% sure on that, but I saw in a similar thread someone claimed to have done that over money owed by a neighbor due to a shared expense... I am pretty confident that the paperwork with the house makes it clear that all the residents that share the private drive are responsible for it's upkeep. I'm confident it was explained to me as we are all responsible for maintaining the driveway. As an example if the wall overhanging the driveway collapses, we all have to cover the cost equally. This should also mean we have to keep the driveway clear for things like emergency vehicles.\n\nI only moved in a year ago, but apparently they have been getting snow removal service for decades and sharing the cost equally. Supposedly Jerk has always been a dick about paying, but he eventually does. \n\nI'm no lawyer, but it sounds reasonable that myself and the other neighbors could take the Jerk's landlord(the owner) to small claims court and then put the lien if they continue to refuse.\n\nThat said I could be way way off base, I'm no lawyer!",

Say you have an easement you use that covers two properties,  so one other than yours.    You only need an ATV to access yours because you just ride trails or camp or other outdoors activities so it has a narrow trail full of ruts and mud holes.   Someone buys the other affected property and wants a house there so they build a nice driveway.   Would it make sense that you would suddenly be required to help maintain this nice driveway?\n\nProperties could potentially have a covenant requiring shared maintenance, but it's not necessarily there.  \n\nPersonally,  I have a mile long access easement through a large parcel to my farm.   There is a single other property that is somewhat active that uses it and another that could use it but doesn't as the owners never go there.  The first landowner knows I need the road more than he does because he can get by with an ATV even if he uses a truck and trailer sometimes and I need to be able to get tractors,  trucks, and trailers through.    If anything happens with the road he is perfectly content to just wait me out.     Similarly, the third parcel came up for sale and a potential owner thought that since I generally keep the road clear in winter that I have a responsibility to do snow removal like a public service.    They wouldn't have any obligation to pay me just as I have no obligation to move snow off the lane if I don't care to (no one pays me as it is).   The second owner enjoys when the lane is cleared, but the most they have done for the road is clear trees that came down during storms so they could get back to their land.    \n\nIf I stop maintaining the road, eventually the other two owners would either need to invest or not be able to drive back there..   However, if I put a gate on the road where it crosses my property to the second parcel, that owner has legal recourse to sue for intentionally blocking access.",

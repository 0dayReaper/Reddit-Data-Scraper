    "postText": "It was a cold winter day. 8 inches of snow had fallen the night before, and the windchill made it feel as if it were in the negatives (Fahrenheit). I drive an all wheel drive SUV so I have no issues getting out. My wife on the other hand drives a Prius, which slides with the smallest amount of moisture on the road. \n\nMy car was down at the time, so we had to take my wife\u2019s car. I spent 45 minutes in the freezing cold shoveling that car out so we could get to the store. We were gone for an hour, and when we came back, our neighbor had taken the spot I had shoveled. \n\nOur apartment complex doesn\u2019t have assigned parking, but in the winter, it\u2019s understood that if you shovel a spot, it\u2019s yours. So when I saw his car in the spot I had just shoveled, I was pretty pissed. \n\nI went inside and filled two gallon jugs of water. Went back out and poured them on his windshield. Rinse and repeat. I must have poured about ten gallons of water on his car. Being how cold it was, it was already freezing by the time I poured the last gallon on. It sat like that overnight. \n\nThe next morning, I got to watch as he helplessly tried to scrape all of these layers of ice off his windshield.\n\nDon\u2019t take my goddamn parking spot.\n\nEdit: you guys need to chill. This isn\u2019t r/AITA. I\u2019m not looking for judgement because I already know I\u2019m an asshole. The point of this sub is to tell stories of petty revenge. I\u2019d say I was being pretty damn petty\n\nEdit 2: sorry, I find it so funny people telling me I committed vandalism. No damage was done except for wasting like 5-10 minutes of his time. Ever hear of freezing rain? It does the same thing I did to his car. Never does any damage. \n\nThis was also many years ago, and the cops haven\u2019t come to arrest me yet. I think I\u2019m good.",

            "comment": "My old post on this and a petty revenge:\n\n&gt;Monday night we got about a foot of snow. Bit unusual for this area, so most people didn't go into work Tuesday. This means street parking is nearly full with unmoved cars covered in snow. Yesterday afternoon I head out to pick up a few things. Shoveling out my car from the street parking spot probably took about 15 minutes. Takes a little while to move the 3,000 or so pounds of snow off and from around my car and dig a path through the snowplows mess.\n\n&gt;The whole time I have been shoveling snow from around my car, there has been a lady waiting to take my parking spot. While there are maybe 2 or 3 empty spots on the street, all are filled with snow. So I do what I must. I put the snow shovel in my trunk and head back inside.",

If the sun gets on it the snow will harden up and it can be a lot worse.\n\nOn the other hand if there is sleet in the forecast sometimes you're better leaving the snow on the car. Maybe just shovel around it but leave the car covered so you don't have to chop so much ice.\n\nSometimes, if I have time, I'll put a small electric heater inside my car and let it melt the ice off the windows.

It was insanely crowded that day. In the middle of my shopping I got a facetime call from my best friend- she's from another country so it was late for her and I really wanted to chat. I returned to my car, turned it on to get some AC, and called her back. I sort of notice a line full of cars near me but paid no attention.\n\nI hear a loud rapping at my window and this older, angry looking lady is scowling at me, so I roll my window down a bit and ask her what the issue is. \"YOU NEED TO LET ME IN MY SPOT\". \"Sorry, what? Your spot\" \"WHY AREN\"T YOU LEAVING CAN'T YOU SEE I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE\" (gestures towards her huge SUV blocking a line of cars).\n\n\"Sorry I wasn't planning on leaving.. I'm on a phone call!\" I hold up my friend on video and she waves, laughing. \"YOU SHOULDN\"T GET IN YOUR CAR IF YOU AREN'T READY TO LEAVE!\" \"Uhhh I think I'm allowed to sit in my car, I'm not done shopping yet.\"\n\n\"YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO PARK UP FRONT. I HAVE GRANDKIDS IN MY CAR.\" \".....\"\n\n\"You can always drive upstairs, I'm sure there's more parking.\" \"BUT I WANT THIS ONE.\" \"No. Sorry.\" I roll my window up and turn to my call. Then the woman freakin goes back into her car, and sits there HONKING incessantly at me! And all the cars behind her are now pissed because they're stuck.\n\nI just continue my call cracking up laughing, then mosey back into the mall.",

I wasn\u2019t even done with my appointment entry, and had the shit scared out of me by this middle-aged lady knocking loudly on my driver window. It\u2019s an underground curry garage, so it was very dim and I hadn\u2019t seen her walk up, but now I see that she had her vehicle with the turn signal on indicating her intent to take my space, and she had actually put it in park, blocking the rest of the drivers, all to get out and tell me to hurry up. I was already a few sub levels below ground, not even near an elevator, and there were more levels below which must have had availability per the in/out occupancy count at the gate. I was just so in shock by being startled and the gall of this bitch, I started up my car immediately and left. In quick retrospect, I should have just gotten out of the car and stood there.",

Basically, she was going Christmas c\nShopping with her 3 kids, and an elderly aunt. She parked in one of the \"parent and small child\" spots at a mall, and they got to their shopping. At one point, one of her kids got grumpy, and needed a nap, but the others wanted to go on the indoor playground thing before leaving, so the aunt said she would take the tired one and all their bags back to the car so the kid could  nap, and the mom could let the others play for 30 minutes. \nWell she goes out the the car and loads up the kid first, then starts putting away bags, and a lady drives by reallllly slowly, and yell out the window something about those spots being reserved for people  with kids, so she needs to move. The aunt just ignored it, then got into the car and turned it on... meanwhile the other woman had done a loop, and came and parked directly behind them, and began honking constantly to try to force them to move..... but they were still waiting for 3 other people to get to the car",

People would literally park at the end of one way lanes and just let cars pile up behind them as they sat and waited for someone to come and open up one of the spots. \n\nIf your one-way lane went away from the college towards the street cars would literally slowroll behind you, even with cars behind them, refusing to let the normal people drive by  so that they could snag ur spot.\n\nAfter months of this I literally would troll cars in the parking lot for petty revenge every fucking day. If someone drive like an asshole, or was holding up a bunch of cars I would literally do stuff like  walk 3,4 spots past my car and once the guy following behind me went to far I would then walk back to my car and now he couldnt back up because he has a line of cars behind him.  \n\nIf someone was being an asshole I would literally put my stuff in my car, walk back towards the campus, and as soon as they would get pissed and drive past I would go back to my car to give my spot to anyone else.  \n\nWould also walk down the wrong aisle on purpose just to avoid people slowrolling me and making cars sit and wait behind them.\n\nThe looks of rage on people after they realized I was denying them my spot on purpose was glorious.\n\nI once had a lady who literally spent 10 minutes waiting for someone to leave their spot... when there were 10+ spots literally 2 cars down... while she had cars piling up behind her.  Things are like this are what led to my daily petty revenge actions. Holding up 4 or 5 cars for any amount of time because you dont want to park 2 more spaces down is fucking insane.\n\nAnd if you honked at me because you were waiting for me to be done sending my text or doing whatever the fuck I am doing in the 15 seconds before I pulled out of my spot, 100% of the time I was going to get out, pretend like I was walking back to the building, and as soon as they sped away would get back in my car and leave.",

My downstairs neighbor was disabled and required a handicap spot that was two spots wide. The complex's super went ahead and painted out one of the lines to give her a double spot, and put up a temp sign saying it was for that one tenant. \n\nAnyway, one night I'm out on my patio and I see that the neighbor has parked in her double-wide spot, but it was harder to see the sign about it being a temporary handicap spot in the dark, so if you didn't already know that, it would just look like someone took up two spots with a shitty parking job.\n\nWhich is exactly what another neighbor assumed. As a sign of protest, he parked as close to the woman's driver's side door as possible and waltzed out of his car really satisfied with himself.\n\nI was about to yell out to him to let him know what the deal was, but my handicapped neighbor had just come out to go to the store when she came across this. As the other neighbor was passing her, she just let out a gentle \"Excuse me?\" He turned around, registered the wheelchair, looked at both their cars, and then *finally* saw the sign.\n\nHe responded with a sheepish apology and then ran as fast as he could to move his car. Fortunately, the painting crews came back after the weekend to finish the job, so it wasn't a long-running problem for her, but I still chuckle at the memory of him going from proud for having stuck it to some asshole driver to watching his body slump a bit when he realized *he* was the asshole.",

One time years ago I lived in an apartment complex on a 1st floor apartment. Another disabled vet who lived in an apartment in the same section as me, but opposite side, equivalent of about 10 parking spaces had been given his own van accessible handicap space, not by name, but everyone knew because he was wheelchair bound, he not only needed extra space, but needed it close to his apartment. \n\nThe reason my roommate and I chose this complex is because parking was bountiful, and both our girlfriends would visit a lot. One day the manager comes by asks me if that was my car in the handicap spot at the other end. I had noticed the car and thought someone had been visiting the guy cause it had been there a week or so. I said, \"no that's not mine, I park right here because the spaces right by apartment are almost never taken. Wouldn't serve me much purpose to park all the way over there. They had just wanted to check with me because they were going to make it his dedicated space, leave the handicap designation on it and add anotherhandicap spot next to it, and wanted to know if I wanted one too. I said I was OK, but was glad they were doing that because the car hadn't budged in a week so they could have parked anywhere. I saw the woman go knock on some more doors. Eventually someone came out and moved their car. Person looked perfectly able, and there were spots that weren't handicap close by.\n\nThey handled it well, next day they had a sign up said reserved for bronze star, purple heart recipient....guys name.\n\nI just couldn't believe some dumbass would park in a van accessible handicap space, leave their car there without going anywhere, when there were other spaces open 10 feet away.\n\nEDIT: for more context, since people are jumping to conclusions about me. The person who took up the spot the entire week was visiting someone else who lived there, didn't use their own vehicle the whole week. Again, as mentioned, no shortage of nearby non handicap parking. This was the only VAN ACESSIBLE spot in that section.\n\nI am well aware of hidden disabilities. Per the first line of my comment, I am disabled myself. Furthermore my Mom has been legally blind my whole life, my Aunt with MS has lived near us since she was diagnosed. When I first suffered the spine damage, I was wheelchair bound. Not expected to recover well enough to not need one. I will never forget how hard it was to get around in a wheelchair from getting out of bed, to taking a shower and getting dressed, to the difficult challenges of getting in and out of a vehicle to go shopping for basics like food, in which the most challenging part is often getting in and out of the car. This is why I would never leave my car parked in a van accessible spot for an entire week when I don't need one.",

It's an unspoken rule in Chicago. Well after a real heavy snow storm I shoveled my spot right in front of our house after the snow plows came down the street. Put out 2 milk crates and went to the store. When I got home the little paisa next door took my spot. So after driving around for an hour pissed off, I found a spot. Instead of going in the house I grabbed my shovel and buried his car. He came outside to a 8ft snow mound. Of course he came and knocked on my door. My girlfriend at the time now my wife woke me up and said there is a pissed off guy at the door. I went out there and he wanted to know why I did that to his vehicle. I asked him how he knew it was me and he said he saw my car their before and that he knew it was me. I told him he had no proof that it was me and that I was sure that spot was saved  so just time he shouldn't take someone else's spot after they shoveled it. I did spend the rest of the morning standing outside watching him shovel out his little ford focus. \n\nPs. \nThe snow froze very hard overnight",

I had an old toyota t100 with a snow plow and used to clear my spot and the spots of some of my friends. I enjoyed snow plowing and was happy to do it. There was a girl that used to try to report me to the college because she said what I was doing was illegal and dangerous. I have a CDL and am no amateur at maneuvering large vehicles and have been plowing snow and driving trucks since before I had a license. Nothing I was doing was breaking any rules, and often times the college grounds management people would even thank me for plowing a bit extra and always clearing handicapped spots. This girl just didnt like me for some reason. One day, I caught her trying to pour water on my windshield. It wasnt freezing, but instead of getting mad, I thanked her for trying to defrost my window. I told her that hot water works better to defrost windows. A few weeks later, I had completely forgotten about the conversation until I saw her with a steaming pot of hot water about to dump it on her own icy windshield. She dumped it, and since the glass was cold, being hit by the hot water made her entire windshield crack. I knew this would happen, and that was why i had told her about this \"great trick\"",

FUCK...\" \nShe goes \"You're really immature!\" and I said \"And fkn mean as hell, too!\" And kept firing. \nMy neighbor she was picking up ain't had shit to say - but he actually got in the truck when I said \"Get in that damned truck!!\" \n\nY'all, everybody is at their wit's end and you really should not be testing people out here in these streets",

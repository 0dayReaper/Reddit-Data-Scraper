    "postText": "Several years ago I was working at this company that already had pretty bad work life balance. We had a coworker that was going on maternal leave, so my manager had me and this guy to taker over the work. After my coworker left for maternal leave, I went to this guy and was trying to figure out how to divide the workload between us, and only to find out that he went to our manager behind my back and argued that he had more important stuff to do so and I should take on all the workload myself. My manager of course agreed because he hated that the big boss trusts me more than him (but I was there much longer than he did). I later found that the \u201cmore important stuff\u201d my manager had him work on, was actually just interviewing and I was more qualified given my experience. Instead, I ended up doing double amount of busy work and absolutely miserable.\n\nI then found a new and better job several months later, and was promoted within a year at the new job. One day, my boss at the new job ask me, hey have you worked with these people at your previous job? It turned out my manager and coworker from my previous job applied to the same opening position at my new job! I of course made sure to tell my new boss how they are not qualified and are not great team players, basically all the negative things without sounded like subjective. Then my new boss basically just tossed both resumes out of the window and didn\u2019t even give them an initial interview, which they would have gotten because of their experience.\n\nLesson here: treat your colleagues nicely and with respect. You never know who you will run into in the future!",

But the professor would rip my work apart. The entire class would go silent. It was so uncomfortable.after class other students would say they were sorry he was so cruel. Felt like it was personal honestly but I kept going, got a B and graduated top of my class and moved on. Years later I\u2019m working in LA and have experience on few big shows. I was asked to be part of a guest panel reviewing artist entries for a local gallery. Lo and behold one of the entries was my former professor. And yes, he was rejected. So OP you\u2019re right.

I was not in business during my recently finished career, but was an elementary school teacher in the Bronx. Three times in my life I met students during summer vacations or holidays that was an extremely low probability of happening. One time on Easter vacation with my girlfriend at the beach in Puerto Vallarta (I won't give details about the cerveza in my hand or my girlfriend's severe lack of clothing). Another time I was a Toronto at the theater and I hear a child that was in my class years before call out my name. Finally a few years ago I was in a podunk little town in the Midwest visiting an elderly Antoinette a kidney stone attack and while in the hospital the janitor was a former student in my school. Sometimes you just have to laugh at those coincidences. Luckily, they were never individuals that I didn't want to meet again in life.",

Eventually, he had to fire her due to her attendance. \n\nA while later, he and his now wife were looking for an apartment.

He thought, \"Oh great, I'm definitely not getting it now.\" \n\nTurns out she was actually the manager and made more money than at the dealership. She immediately recognized him and told them not to worry they would get it no matter what. Because of him firing her, she was able to find something better and more suitable for her.

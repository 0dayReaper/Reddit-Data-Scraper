    "postText": "We were both in high school, and at the end of the relationship he told me he was \"just in it for the sex\" that he \"didn't really mean any of it\", and that I obviously \"just wanted him because I was horny\". He then went and had a hot and heavy make out sess with my best friend and came back and told me I was \"a bad kisser compared to her\". Yeah, he was a jerk.\n\nWell, flash back to a few months previous. I was angry at him because he was being really hot and cold and so I wrote an angry poem about him. The magazine he had been trying to get into had a website and would publish poems based off of popularity on the website. He had gotten me to join a few months previous and I only had a few poems up. I decided against posting it then because it would \"be too mean\".\n\nWell after he had pulled that shit I decided I wanted a little revenge. So I posted the poem. And suddenly it was getting A LOT of popularity. And I get a notification from the magazine saying they want to publish it.   So what was the first thing I did? Messaged him that I got published in this magazine. He got excited for me and congratulated me, until... he read the poem.\n\nSeveral million people have read the poem in the magazine, and to this day, he still hasn't gotten published.\n\nEdit: Automod removed the post. Here's the poem. [https://www.teenink.com/poetry/free\\_verse/article/848293/He-Was-A-Poet](https://www.teenink.com/poetry/free_verse/article/848293/He-Was-A-Poet)",

It was about being denied things simply because of the color of his skin. He would never be able to just work hard and be successful, accumulate wealth or even property. He would be killed for being with a white woman even if she initiated it. He could be killed for even looking at a white woman. \n\n\nI think that's why hip hop/ rap focuses on these things-- money, power, women. All the things black men will be denied unless they become successful. And even then things happen like j Cole getting the cops called on him because he lives in a wealthy neighborhood so he must be a drug dealer. ",

I always interpreted \"motherfucker I am\" as a reference to the music he makes, and it's broad consumption and huge and dedicated fanbase. Music listeners want amazing music from J. Cole like someone who wants weed or a gram or 2 of coke would go to their dealer. Because the whole rest of the song juxtaposes their lived experiences with the new environment, and how they can't run away from the assumptions their affluent white neighbors make about him and his friends for being black.",

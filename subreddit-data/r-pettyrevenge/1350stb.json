    "postText": "I had a few dates with a guy (lets call him \"Snake\") like 20+ years ago. I was vaguely aware that he had been dating this other woman, \"J\" but she had moved to another country a year before and there was no indication they were still together. He said they were pretty casual (they never lived together and were never exclusive per everyone who knew them). I was sure to ask around before accepting a date with him. It was the general consensus that it was fine. I did not have a way to get a hold of her (before the internet was reliably available in many countries). \n\nAfter a few dates I had since decided that he was cute but had caught him in some lies and he displayed some red flags about manipulative behavior. So I said let's just be acquaintances. He was fine with it. He was clearly playing the field and no hard feelings. It was pretty common in our group to date around and not be jealous or serious at the time. But people were respectful of each other. \n\nWell J came back a few months later and made a huge-ass scene, screaming and yelling at me at a nightclub. I was like WTF. A mutual friend took us out of the club and mediated a looong conversation between us. It was ridiculous. I was like \"I am not responsible for J's feelings and don't really care that she's mad, but sure I will try to work it out.\" I was like \"hey sorry if I hurt your feelings, I respect you and that was not my intent. But homie has been playing the field so you may want to address your rage at him rather than me.\" It took HOURs that I will never get back in my life, but she finally calmed down and was able to see that he had lied to her and to me. We \"made up\" commiserated that he was manipulative to us both and she agreed her feelings were not my problem and apologized for making a scene.  I was not too happy about being put in the \"other woman\" role and would never agree to that. I told her I had guys cheat on my and it feels gross and I don't want to be a part of that.  I thought she believed me.\n\nI didn't hate him or anything and was fine seeing him at social functions.  I barely knew this woman. I would just see her at parties or clubs or whatever. But I thought it was all good and things were chill again. I had no idea if she got back together with him or what and didn't really care. It wasn't my business. \n\nThen she started working at one of my worksites. It was a social services center with lots of vulnerable clients getting basic needs met. I was in another agency that would come by and pick up certain clients for services in the evening. I had been doing my job for several years and had no idea she wanted to do that kind of work. We were cordial at the worksite and I offered her help getting more work and experience in the field if she was interested. She was gracious and friendly. No issues. This is become important to know later-I also knew all of her bosses for years and was tight with them and know 90% of the clients really well having worked there before and having been in the field for a long time. I was decently well-respected and I loved the people at the site. \n\nA few months later I was driving with my friend on my way to a party at a mutual friend's house. I saw Snake and another male friend (K) getting off a bus to walk to the party. It was kind of a schlep and they had some musical equipment so we pulled over, and offered them a ride. (this is pre-Uber as well) We pulled up and got to the party and I helped them and some other folks bring their equipment into the house. It was a party of musicians and people were gonna jam and I am always happy to help with a designated driver ride, make food, bring booze or whatever so I can rock out. It was something I had been doing for a long time and would do again. NBD. \n\nWell apparently J was there and saw me (GASP) talking to Snake and helping with the equipment. She (unbeknownst to me at the time) stormed out the back and flounced out in a huff. I never even saw her. She never asked what was going on. I am allowed to talk to people and give them rides. It doesn't mean I humping them. Sheesh. I enjoyed the party and drove some other musicians to their homes later. Like I said, NBD.  \n\nA week later I come into the social services site to pick up my clients and I see her. She glared, stomped and flipped her ponytail in a mini-fit. The whole room got quiet. Clients noticed, staff noticed. All eyes were on me. I just ignored her antics and called out my clients' names from the list to get them on the van. I got no time for nonsense when I am at work. \n\n\\*As a side-note this was a women's/nonbinary only space and while working there I have broken up many fights over boyfriends or girlfriends between clients. Like people throwing lunch trays and sh!t. So I am as stoic as f@ck when people bring drama at me. The clients were STOKED. \"OOOOOHHHH staff drama! Hell yes!\"\n\nSo I ignored her and did my job. I was thinking \"wow that is super unprofessional but I am not letting that sh!t rub off on me. Get yourself together girl.\" but I kept my bland, pleasant expression. This made her even more pissed and she stomped off to a back office. The manager was there and looked at me with curious eyes. I knew she was gonna squeeze me for deets later.   \nI got home and J left a VM on my landline machine (yes I am actually 100 years old now) stating that she knew I was still f@cking Snake and she said \"you are not my friend\" very clearly. She also said \"Snake and I are *soul mates* and you can't keep us apart!\" And complained about the night I came in \"with him, like a couple\" I was like \"oh good grief! you have got to be kidding me!?\"\n\nSo I called her back and got her VM. I said \"First of all, you said I am not your friend. Thank you for that. I am officially freed from worrying about your feelings ever again. Second, I spent WAY too much time dealing with your emotions about your perceptions of my behavior. I was done with you when you acted like a jackass at my place of work, anyway. Third, while I am on the subject of work, if you EVER even look at me funny in a work situation, I will get your ass fired so quick your head will spin. Fourth, Go make a wonderful life with your 'soul mate' who likes to fuck other women. Best of luck with that. Five, LEAVE ME THE F@CK ALONE.\" I know it verbatim because my friend and I wrote it out and I just read from the paper. I was sorting things recently and ran into it so decided to post it here. \n\nThe next time I worked at the worksite, the big boss (BB, a fricken badass who has my eternal respect) pulled me aside as I expected and asked what was up with J. I told her truthfully my side and said I was disappointed that she was so ridiculous at our worksite and this needs to be a safe place free of drama for our clients.  I told BB I would continue to ignore J's drama. She said \"don't worry about it\". \n\nI never saw J again. Apparently she was fired for her behavior and yelled at BB when BB asked WTF was up with her and screeched that I was a devil woman or something. \n\nEpilogue: I am still friends with K, the other musician guy 20+ years later. Yay social media!\n\nEpilogue 2: My friend S who knew J from working social services ran into her at a coffee shop. S is a snoopy b!tch so she got an update that J is a yoga teacher now. Hopefully she is happy and found a more suitable person to be with. Yikes.",

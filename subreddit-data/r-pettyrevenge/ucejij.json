    "postText": "I (26f) do not look like I would know a single thing about cars. 5\u20193 with long blonde hair, soft girly appearance, and an eternal baby face that makes me look about 15-16 years old. I drive a rather beat up looking 2004 Avalon. My dad and brother are both mechanics. Not my profession, but I\u2019ve learned a thing or seven from them and am very comfortable working on cars. I\u2019m only mentioning my appearance because it\u2019s pretty common for mechanics to assume that I\u2019m an idiot about cars.\n\nA while back, I was pretty overwhelmed with life and didn\u2019t have a good space to do it, so I took my car in to get the oil changed. The place offered a free of charge \u201chead to toe\u201d inspection for any repairs that might need to be made. I knew my car was fine. I had pretty recently changed the air filter and brake pads. Rotors had maybe 40k miles on them and were in great condition. New serpentine belt too. Literally just didn\u2019t feel like changing my oil. \n\nRELEVANT NOTES: Before I went to the shop I actually checked my air filter and it was, in fact, pristine. Also, I usually call my dad while I\u2019m working on my car so we can chat so he knows what repairs/maintenance I\u2019ve done and that my car is well taken care of. \n\nAfter they changed my oil, the guy came back with the \u201cinspection results\u201d on a clip board and was holding my air filter. He had this grave look on his face like something was wrong. Mind you, this is a very busy place and there were lots of customers in the waiting room. He told me that we needed to go over the results because my car was about to be completely broken down and also not safe to drive if I didn\u2019t get several repairs done ASAP because these were all completely shot. The repairs: new brake pads, new rotors, new calipers, replace serpentine and drive belt, NEW AIR FILTER, new compressor or my AC will not work(a heavy threat in the middle of summer in FL), and a couple more generic things. He showed me my air filter that was filled with dead grass, A DEAD WASP, some dirt, AND HAIR. Bruh. He really scooped some bullshit off the shop floor and put it in my new air filter to try and freak me out.  The total? About $1500 worth of work. It would be more expensive anywhere else but he was \u201cwilling to give me a deal.\u201d\n\nSo I immediately start buying myself time by asking some basic questions that I knew he would have to explain so I could nod at him  all wide eyed while I came up with a good way to respond to what he was doing. \u201cWhat does the serpentine belt do? Is it important? Etc.\u201d\n\nI texted my dad, \u201cI\u2019m calling in a sec just play along.\u201d Told the guy, \u201comg that\u2019s so scary I can\u2019t believe I was driving around like that. Thank you so much for caring! I don\u2019t have the money so let me call my dad real quick to see if he can help me out. I can\u2019t afford this.\u201d I then proceeded to enhance my dramatic performance by even working up a tear while I called my dad. \n\nThe guy is standing there with me in front of all the customers. I put my phone on speaker and gave my dad a whole sob story about how I need money again I\u2019m so sorry can he help me? He asked what the repairs were and how much. I said \u201cidk but it sounds REALLY bad. He says that it\u2019s dangerous. Dad, I can\u2019t be without a car. What am I going to do?\u201d Then I asked the guy to tell my dad what the repairs were. He rattles it all off and my dad is playing his part PERFECTLY. \u201cOh wow\u201d, \u201cmmhmm\u201d, \u201coh my goodness I\u2019m glad you caught this so she\u2019s not in danger anymore.\u201d Little did this scammer know, he was the one in danger. \n\nHe hands the phone back and I dropped the facade and start laughing really hard. As soon as dad hears me he started scream cackling into the phone. I said \u201cDAD DO YOU HEAR THIS BULLSHIT?! Get this, he brought me my new air filter I just put in to show me how dirty it was. He pulled shit off the floor or something and rubbed it on there.\u201d Dad and I continue to crack up. The audience in the waiting room was also cracking up. Scammy Mechanny was beet red and completely at a loss for words. Head down and some stuttering was his response. \n\nI handed him my air filter and told him to go vacuum it out and to make sure to let me see it before he put it back in. I sat and watched him put it back once it was clean  and also watched him pull my car out to make sure he didn\u2019t do anything horrible while I wasn\u2019t looking. \n\nI might have taken it a little far, but I REALLY hate when mechanics take advantage of people who don\u2019t know anything about cars, so this felt like a massive win. Big props to my dad for his performance, and for teaching me about cars.",

So I said, thank you for the letting me know. And walked out, paying for just the tires. A couple weeks later, I checked them out myself with my dad (also mechanic) and said they are still fine. A year later, changed the brakes and a caliper (shredded one side completely) for about $500 on my own.",

Ask around at work and family to find one. You're probably gonna have different brands over the years, and dealerships can be scammy too, so find an independent one. Warranty work at the dealer, the rest with your good guy.\n\nSadly lots of \"mechanics\" now are just vaguely trained part replacers, especially at the dealership - far from all of them are actually good mechanics that can fix a $10 part of a part instead of replacing the $800 part entirely.",

No don\u2019t worry about it, I bought a whole bunch of them so these are on me\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve recommended so many people to him that he\u2019s been able to open up his own shop instead of renting bays from independent shop owners he knows, and the only issue I have with him now is he\u2019s too damn busy lol",

Even so, I've definitely heard of the air filter scam before. Luckily my dad does all upkeep on the car (it is also in his name) and when he does have to take it in he already knows the likeliest problem and it's just something he doesn't wanna fck with himself (transmission, recharging ac, etc). No one ever does try to scam him, though.",

Funny how that description fits. \n\nHubs got out after 6 years. 1:1 dwells with 3 month rotations meant most of the years he was active, we spent more time tax exempt based on his deployments than not. I am glad we didn't have to do any 18 month deployments but between the deployments, TDYs, and having to deal with ready rotations it was just time for a change. There was only 1 instance while he was active that they had to launch the ready reserves. He got 12 hrs notice in the middle of the night for launch and was gone for a while. Things ended up ok, but he was tired of being part of the 'tip of the spear' for the military. (AC-130s)",

I had a problem with my front tire and my boyfriend (who is also a Marine) took up my bike up to replace the front tire. Thet gave him a bunch of garbage and told them that not only did I need the most expensive tire, I needed two of them, because you couldn't have different tires on a bike. He called me up put me on speaker and asked my opinion. I told him the mechanic was full of s***, and to get me a mid-priced tire. I despise dishonest mechanics.",

I went in to get a new battery and they were supposed to give me a prorated discount for the old battery. The auto department did their thing and sent me to customer service afterwards to pay. Their paperwork said I was entitled to a $40 discount I think. The idiot at the front scanned my old receipt, entered a credit for the old price, then entered the $40 the auto guy calculated as a discount, then billed me for the new battery and handed me $25 change!!!!\n\n Told her no, it\u2019s $40 off the new price, you did it wrong. Apparently that\u2019s a secret sign for them to dig in their heels and refuse to change. I asked for her manager, explained what happened, and he said it was right, too!!

I was so angry since I had talked my Dad into getting me a used Jaguar XKE (I loved the look of those cars) his only condition was that I had to be able to do all the maintenance and repairs myself. Since I could never take classes I never got my Jag.\n\nEven now as a 70 something year old blond woman I still get a few mechanics who will try to bullshit me but, not for long. I have learned a few things over the years.\n\nI love seeing my amazing DIL turn a wrench. In the winter of 2020-2021 she tore down her track bike and basically did a rebuild on that. Now she has a Jeep she is learning to fix. Their garage has more vehicle tools to the point that only 2 wheeled vehicles will fit and that is a bit tight at times.\n\nI have had some really great people who have helped me care for my vehicles, people I trust.",

The keys they\u2019d given us to test drive didn\u2019t have one, but I hadn\u2019t paid attention at that point. \n\nWe go in to sign the paperwork and the salesman hands me 2 keys. No fobs. I asked where they were, and he tried to tell me that list was what was POSSIBLE to get with it. I demanded the fobs as they were listed. He had the gall to tell me \u201care you buying a car or did you just want key fobs??\u201d In this smarmy \u2018you\u2019re a stupid little girl\u2019 voice. He did, surprisingly, manage to come up with one fob, despite him insisting it didn\u2019t have any. \n\nWe finally left (it was around 8 pm at this point) and my first stop the next day was to the sales manager. I was FURIOUS. I told him I didn\u2019t appreciate being talked down to by the salesman, or lied to, and that I wanted what my car was supposed to have, 2 key fobs. It was in the paperwork, and it wasn\u2019t that old of a car that it should\u2019ve been difficult. They also sold the fobs there, so if the guy had just went and had a couple programmed it would\u2019ve went so much easier.  \n\nThe sales manager was abjectly apologetic and practically groveled after I told him how badly I was talked down to and how pissed I was.  I got another key fob and an apology. \n\nHowever I swore I\u2019d never buy another car from them. The only reason we bought that one is we\u2019d already had the financing and such set up, and our car had died when we pulled in the lot. It was old and worn out and we were just happy it got us there.",

You'd be surprised how many mechanics will balk at just putting it in writing knowing that you're not going to have them do the work..... Somehow knowing that you're not going to have them do the work makes it magically not need doing.",

I had her come to the dealership on a Sunday, and took care of everything on it. Did filters, brakes, tires, pulled a few dents, the serp belt, and some other minor Bs the day before she brought it to Subaru. I ordered everything from the same Subaru dealership the car was being sold to. A tech brought it back into the shop, and I could see it being worked on from where we were.\nHe walked around it, bent down \"inspected\" the brakes, opened the hood for all of 60 seconds, wrote some shit down on a piece of paper, and cake out saying they were going to have to take $2,500 off the price because the brakes were worn down and aftermarket, the serpbelt was cracked, needed new tires. She played dumb, and went along with it. Eventually, I chimed in \"oh, actually, I'm a technician over at Honda, and I did replaced everything you said needed to be replaced on Sunday. I'd like to see your manager, and have you show the three of us specifically everything you said needed to be changed. \nThis kid turned as red as coke, stumbled over his words a little, and said \"sure. One second\" service manager comes over, along with the used car manager, and the 5 of us go out to look at the car. The service manager and used cars manager have the writeup from the tech in hand. The 11/32nds he measured this time on the tires did not match the 2/32nds he wrote on the paper. Nor did the 10mm pad thickness on the brakes match the 3mm he had written down. The serp belt had no cracks, and was not feeling, the filters were whiter than I am as well. With every item the tech re-checked, the managers' faces got less and less happy, and more red. \nWe ended up getting $1,500 over what was initially offered on the car.",

I panic cus I can't believe I didn't notice a difference in the handling when driving and I could have gotten into a crash, can't afford repairs cus I'm broke; but also have to be able to drive for work. \n\nConvince him to let me take it home cus I'll need to get a loan but have no idea how long that will take; and once home mention it to my friend who is a mechanic. He gets very suspicious because one of the repairs quoted was for a real axle and my car doesn't actually *have* rear axles, it's a prius. In hindsight the scammy mechanic probably opened with the rear axles to see how car savvy I was, and when I believed him he followed on with all the other bullshit.\n\nWe take it into friend's shop and the brakes are fine. I was gunna just leave it, but then I got an email from the first company asking if I could leave them a review cus they love customer feedback.I was like OH, YOU WANT A REVIEW? and absolutely laid into them about how they scammed a disabled woman and encouraged me to go into debt to perform repairs that didn't need doing. Got some supporting evidence from my friend's shop showing that the brakes were fine and that the repair quotes were bogus.\n\nHeard back very quickly from the head of the entire company informing me that the mechanic who worked on my car was no longer employed with them. He'd discovered the guy had also overcharged me for my basic service so he was refunding the overcharge immediately, and would be refunding the rest of the service fee in a few days once accounts sorted it. This shop does all the repairs for the city police branch cars, so they were probably shitting themselves that I'd report them.\n\nFun followup: I'm dating the mechanic friend now and he's slowly teaching me how to do my own car work.",

When our previous car started having transmission issues we were definitely worried about how much it was going to cost us.  We took it to a shop and the mechanic diagnosed a pretty severe transmission issue that would cost about 2k to fix.  We were crushed when we heard the news.\n\nThen he told us how it shouldn't cost us anything since the manufacturer had a recall for the defect.  All we had to do is contact them and they would cover all repairs and a rental vehicle.  Turns out he was right and it didn't cost us a penny.  He could have said nothing and put all that money in his own pocket.  He earned a customer for life when he did that.  Bought him a case of beer as thanks, and will for sure go to him for any future needs.\n\nBad mechanics might get one over here and there, but that's short money.  A loyal customer will refer others and stick with you.",

    "postText": "This is a story from 8th grade, so like 2013. I was bullied by one kid for a few months at this point. It was only as much as knocking into me in the halls and calling me names, but this increased as we were put in a PE class together. Every day I was targeted. One day we had an odd exercise where we were taken to the weight room and given 30 seconds at a station or machine before rotating to the next. The rotation followed a pattern that put the Bully directly behind me. At first being self conscious of how much weaker I was, I realized he would likely out-do me in weight. So I watched the clock, and seconds before switching I moved the weight higher than I could lift. Sure enough, at every machine he raised the weight past where I had set it because he couldn't be out-do be by my noodle arms. He had to stop near the end of the class because he pulled a muscle in his arm. I gave a comment in passing that had something to do with him not being strong enough.\n\nI eventually told the right people and he stopped harassing me, but this was a fun victory that I like to think back on from time to time.\n\nEdit: GOADED. I guess this is a word I understood wrong my whole life",

When I see such signs, I have a private word with the student to find out what's going on so that I can help.\n\nOnce I saw a student \"book\" (knock the books out of the arms) of one my students.  I went BALLISTIC and SCREAMED at the bully (and trust me, when I scream like that, it's very scary).  \n\nI was, and still am, one of the teachers all students know they can go to for help.  No student, whatever age, should be hurt--physically or emotionally--or made to feel afraid by ANYONE",

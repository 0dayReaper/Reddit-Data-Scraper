    "postText": "Our church has a large U-shaped parking lot with only one entrance and exit.  I always prefer to park towards the exit to avoid the logjam that inevitably occurs when services end.  The caveat to this method is that the entrance to the church is close to the entrance of the parking lot and we always have to wait for the elderly people to park in the handicap spots as well as general pedestrian traffic making their way to the church.  Realistically, you just need to wait an extra 2 minutes to let everyone go by and it's not that big of a deal to me to wait.  \n\nOver the last few months we've noticed a larger amount of cars entering the wrong way so they can get first dibs on the spots closest to the exit and avoid the pedestrian foot traffic altogether.  On more than one occasion I've made my way to the spots near the exit only to see another car headed my way going the wrong direction.  Nothing close to a head-on collision, but annoying nonetheless because there's not much room to maneuver around each other, hence the one-direction traffic flow.  \n\nYesterday we get to church early enough where no one should be in a rush.  We're greeted by an F-250 headed right at us so I stopped where I was, let this guy back into his spot, and waited for him to get out.  I got to the spot right next to him, told my wife and kids to get out because it's going to be a tight fit, and backed in leaving this guy no room to open his door.  He parked on his line too which meant I could get REALLY close.  Church ends and he's standing by his truck because he can't leave.  I started the car, pulled in front of him because my wife doesn't have room to open her door, get out to help my  other kid strap into their seat, and this guy shoots a very annoyed look at me because he still can't leave.  I gave him a big smile and a \"peace be with you, brother\".  I'm looking forward to doing it again next week.",

God is incredibly petty, from small things to the whole 'worship and adore me or burn in anguish for all eternity' way. Church indoctrinates people in pettiness so well that they don't even see the Gospel as petty. But when ancient people created the idea of Hell being for non-believers, rather than making it a place to punish evil people, the whole religion jumped the shark. God so loved the world? You need to be a mental gymnast if you're going to think very hard about that whole 'blood sacrificing myself to save you all from a place and rules created by myself' thing, and still remain a Christian.",

I taught Sunday school for 7 years. I was secretary on the Council on Ministries at my church. I was a youth group leader. I've read the entire Bible. So I'm really curious exactly which part of my statement that you think demonstrates a lack of understanding of the Christian religion? I have thought very long and hard about my religion, and lived with a lot of mental gymnastics, before it finally dawned on me within the last decade what was wrong. So if there is something I'm truly not understanding, I'm curious as to what it is. When you read my comment, what specifically did you think was not accurate, and why? Thank you. Also, thanks for reading my first comment and taking the time to respond. I do appreciate that.",

I grew up Catholic and didn\u2019t believe Jesus was real until he showed up in my bedroom. I can understand your point of view. I think that actually having a revelation of him as a real, live being would change your perspective. I wish I knew the answer as to how to make that happen. I know the Bible says \u201cYou will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.\u201d-Jeremiah 29:13. The God I experience is extremely loving. Best wishes to you.",

You don't know me, and have no idea what my relationship with Jesus was like. You are simply assuming that since I don't feel as you feel now, I can't have ever felt as you do now. This is very common among people I try to discuss this with, an inability to grasp that I can have felt as you do now, and then have grown farther.\n\nBut it doesn't address my central question. Why would I desire to stay in a personal relationship with somebody who very clearly states that I need to believe in them or will suffer anguish for all eternity in the fires of Hell, with weeping and gnashing of teeth? Do you not see how absolutely monsterous that plan is? Why do you, and why did I, think that is loving? It is abusive.\n\nMy question is rhetorical, so no need to answer. I'm not trying to put you on the spot or argue with you. Please just know that I have indeed felt what you feel now, in the past, and so I have compassion for believers. I was never even thinking about the horrendousness and vile pettiness of these concepts. But if you actually look at God's plan for salvation, and if you believe and understand that it would mean that billions of people are already burning under this plan, and you call that love -- then you are not really comprehending what the religion is about, or what love is about.\n\nAll of the good that you are attributing to God is really inside yourself. You are a good person, and you are assigning your own feelings of love and your own well earned personal strengths and accomplishements, to coming from God. The credit is really yours. Everything you have accomplished in this life you have done, with no help from the supernatural. You are a force to be reckoned with, and should go ahead and take full credit. I mean that in all sincerity. You're good, and kind, and loving and strong. That is why you imagine God to be that way. We all create God in our own image, which is why there are so many ways to come off as being a Christian, and you can tell what kind of a person is by what they think God is or does or loves or hates. And as good as you think religion is, I think that you are believing in and accepting your own goodness and mercy and power. You have come to connect with everything good about yourself, and that is beautiful.\n\nIt's ok if we are not in agreement.  just ask that you consider that just because I have different views than you do doesn't mean that I don't know what I am talking about. It would be kinder not to judge like that, even though you prefaced it with \"Respectfully\", which I did appreciate. We are in different places in our lives and may never be on the same path. But neither of us \"doesn't know what we're talking about\". We both have the right to hold our beliefs. Peace be with you, and stay cool.",

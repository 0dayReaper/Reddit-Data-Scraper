    "postText": "This is recent event, not to serious.\n\nMe and my wife traveled back from vacation. We're frequent flyers and we know our way around planes, and we respect that people in front of us can and probably will recline their seats. It's really no problem. \n\nSooo... We're flying with Qatar Airlines and in front of my wife is some girl who is constantly reclining her seat, getting up, putting sit up. Basically in 10 minutes she did all that is possible with her seat. \nHer husband and I are sitting across the isle in C seats, our wives are in D. \n\nMy wife is pissed but she's not acting out, she's just frustrated because she is watching movie and need to adjust screen every 2 minutes. \nIn one moment I noticed that girl in front of her is smiling and communicating with her husband, and pointing at my wife. Like she's doing it intentionally. They don't know she's my wife and I'm watching my movie and acting cool. \n\n\nSooo time for revenge. Airplane landed, time for leaving and I'm seeing husband preparing to stand up. I notices where their bags are when we boarded. So I stood up first, and blocked guy from grabbing his bags. I'm pretty big guy, and this dude is for one head smaller than me. So I'm standing there acting cool, not giving him any space to pass me and grab bags. Other people are grabbing their luggage, people are ready to leave plane and there's two of them and their cousins of friends (they took 6 seats) sitting in their seats and waiting. Guy is really pissed off but he's silent. And when there was time to leave plane I let my wife first, gst after her but firstly I was assured that line continues after me. \nThey left plane last... And that dude was furious. \n\nSorry for long read.",

Boomers literally grew up in a generation where if you wanted to beat your kid for being disrespectful, you beat the fuck out of your kid with whatever you could get your hands on. By Gen X, they put laws in place that didn't allow that anymore, so they didn't get the discipline they needed. So if anything, Gen X definitely ruined it because their Boomer parents couldn't give appropriate discipline to the behavior, much like how yours obviously didn't discipline you enough. Talk about \"courtesy\" and how Boomers have none but obviously you have zero room to talk.",

Upgrade to a seat that fits you or don\u2019t go on the plane. Expecting everyone to cater to you is ridiculously entitled. You can still use your tray when the seat is reclined, unless, maybe, again, you are too tall and need a different spot that doesn\u2019t inconvenience others. You didn\u2019t ask them to keep it up, so why should they ask you to recline? You just jam your knees there so that they can\u2019t. One of those is as intended and one is absolutely not. Goodness gracious the audacity.",

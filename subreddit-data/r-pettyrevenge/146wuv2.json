    "postText": "Hi all, I got a boyfriend not too long ago (But he's gone now)! After dating for a month, we moved in together! I had a cat, he had a dog! Of course about my cat, I warned in advance, as well as he about his dog! I asked beforehand if there would be any problems between our animals. He said no, his dog gets along with everyone. I asked, I asked this because there was a possibility of my cat at my parents' house! So in the end the animals didn't get along and my boyfriend just started hating my cat. I offered to send him to his parents, but he kept saying no, let it be as it is! And so for one weekend, I go to a friend, leaving the guy alone! I have a fun weekend, and before leaving home, I get the message, \"I went out to the store and apparently forgot to close the window, and came back no Hessy (Hessy cat's name). I get home sad and start typing \"lost cat\" ads. He reassures me in every way, but I only care about my cat! A couple of days go by and the number I left on the ad man dials and said, \"Here's your phone number, they are responsible for the cameras in our house, maybe it will somehow help find a cat. I dialed the number, I was explained how to access the cameras (there was some kind of application for tenants of the house). And you can't imagine how shocked I was when I saw that my boyfriend took my cat out himself at night and he never came back! Do you have any idea what a motherfucker that is? I did not tell him about it, but the next day while he was at work, I took his dog to my parents. do everything according to his scheme, in tears I called him saying \"Gucci\" ran away (Gucci dog's name). And he comes home in a panic, asking how? I say I left him at the store, but apparently the leash was taken and he ran away (I know it sounds stupid). He starts accusing me that I can't forgive him for leaving the window open and my cat ran away! after listening to this for a few days and when he was at work again, I packed all my stuff, brought my dog and left for my parents! In the evening he texted me happy that his dog was home, but didn't even ask where I was or where my stuff was? I silently texted him the video of him taking my cat out and we never spoke again.",

    "postText": "Posted this in \"pro-revenge\" said it wasn't revenge enough I guess....\n\nSo about a year and a half ago I started receiving calls on my cell phone saying in a pre recorded message;\n\n\"we are calling in regards to your gas card credit card, give us a call back at 800-***-****\"\n\nWhen I call the number back this is the conversation\n\n\"who are you looking for?\"\n\n\"We are looking for (let's say... Your momma's construction (YMC)) about your gas card being behind payments\"\n\n\"This is not YMCA, this is a personal cell phone\"\n\nThey then hang up. I think that was it.\n\nNext day, a 404 number calls me around 1pm and it's a live person;\n\n\"We're calling in regards to your gas card being past due\"\n\n\"Who are you looking for?\"\n\n\"YMC\"\n\n\"This is not YMC, it is a personal cell phone, I am not and never have been affiliated with that company, stop calling my phone\"\n\nThey hang up.\n\nThen at 8pm I get a call from that 800 number. Same thing recorded telling me to call this number. So I call and tell them this is not the company you are looking for.\n\nSo for the next 3 weeks every day that 800 number calls me between 8:00pm and 8:10pm always with the same recorded message.\n\nI got tired of it and called the number back and told them.\n\"If you call this f**kin number back one more time I will sue you and your company for harassment!!!\"\n\nDude who picked up said \"ok, go ahead\"\n\nI blocked their numbers and after 8:10pm every freaking day I get a notification for a new voicemail. It's always the same recording.\n\nSo, I called them back and said;\n\n\"If you don't stop calling my phone I will be contacting an attorney who will be suing you for harassment!!!\"\n\nBut again 7 days a week, after 8:10pm never get a call there would be a voicemail pop up on my phone. Always the same recording. That went on for about 3 or 4 months. I finally decided to seek an attorney which I was quickly able to find one willing to take on the case.\n\nAttorney called me and filed a motion with the courts to stop the calls. Filed a lawsuit with them the day he filed it the calls finally stopped and found out it was a company (SubContracted Company (SCC)) subcontracted by a Big Credit Card Company (BCCC). \n\nAnyway he filed that back in October I think. I got a call from him yesterday saying the BCCC is trying to get out of the suit because the attorney is opening a class action against the SCC and the BCCC is trying to get ahead of the suit and get their name out of it. He told me that he is up to a 50k settlement. For just the BCCC to get out of the class action.\n\nTell me to \"go ahead and sue\" and that's what I'll do.",

(If that's true where did SCC get my number). So the attorney said 50k for BCCC to stay out of the initial class action. BCCC was trying to get out \"globally\" so they can't be added back to the class action again but my attorney is amazing and got it to what it is. He said he is still working on getting the initial settlement higher.(I'm hoping they add an additional 50k to that (100k)) that will make it 70k in my pocket. Then I will be the lead plaintiff in the class action so I'll be getting double money.",

    "postText": "My ex husband and I bought our home from his parents. They had the house built in the 50's.\n\nFor years, father in law wanted to install a shutoff valve in the utility room to, you know, shut off the water to the whole house to do some repairs. Plumber told him it would cost a large amount of money because they could not find the shut off from the city water main at the street, the \"buffalo box\", a/k/a water main shut off valve. Since the buffalo box was MIA, they would have to freeze the pipes to stop the water before installing the shutoff valve. It was an expensive process to freeze the pipes so it never got done.\n\nWhen we bought the house, we decided to get the shut off valve installed. We called the water department and they sent 2 workers to shut off the water.\n\nWhen they arrived, I explained the problem. They went out to the front yard, walked around a bit and told me there was nothing they could do for me. According to the 2 workers, it was my problem that they could not find the buffalo box and that I should call a plumber to dig up my front yard, sidewalk, and city easement to find MY buffalo box.\n\nWell, I have a background in residential real estate construction and I was familiar with how water mains and buffalo boxes are installed and I told them it was the city's issue, as they were responsible for the buffalo box, not the homeowners.\n\nAccording to these guys, as a woman, I did not know what I was talking about and they left. They were incredibly rude about it, but peons like these think they can get away with being rude to an ignorant woman like me.\n\nFast forward to a year or so later. I get a call from the city manager asking why I hadn't paid my water bill for over a year. I told him that I wanted to pay my water bill, but I wanted them to first turn off my water. He was a bit taken aback that I WANTED them to turn off the water. \n\nSo, I explained what the city workers told me about locating the buffalo box and their attitude about women not understanding those type of things. I also told him that if the city could not turn off my water, I would be happy to have free water forever, cuz I would never pay another bill. We had a nice long chat about the situation and he said that he would resolve my concerns. \n\nThe next day, these same 2 guys show up at my house with some digging equipment and spend the whole day digging up the easement and the sidewalk. Their attitudes were rather somber, cuz the city manager told me he was going to give them a talking to about how they mishandled the situation. I even got an apology!!!\n\nThey found the buffalo box, under the city owned sidewalk!! They fixed the buffalo box so it would be accessible and came the next day to fix the sidewalk. They asked if I wanted the water turned off, declined, and I told them I would have my plumber take care of it when we had him install the interior shutoff valve.\n\nAnd then I paid the water bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Maybe my city is the exception but both the Utility and Utility Billing departments are on it when it comes to collecting and servicing our city residents.",

I suppose that's great in February when you come in from the slopes and your tuchus is frozen. Not as much fun in the summer.\n\nOh, and my undergrad college ran the cold water lines for the water fountains next to the steam lines for the chemistry labs. Longer you ran them, the warmer it got.",

He writes shit down. This goes on for a while. He just doesn't fucking get it.

Hubby just ignores them and looks at me to try to politely direct them my way. It usually takes 10-15 minutes of me answering every question  before they give up and start talking directly to me.

I'm having a hard time envisioning how they could have been *that* clueless as to where it was/how to find it?

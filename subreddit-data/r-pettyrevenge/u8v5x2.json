    "postText": "My girlfriend(F22) and I(M25) had been dating for almost a year now. She's in university, living in the university residence, I work full time and have my own place. Her residence has some very strict rules such as no male guests aside from parents and a strict curfew, this will be important later(we're not in the US btw).\n\nBefore the Easter holidays a few friends and I planned a road trip, I invited her but she declined.\n\nThe day before my road trip I decided to get some new earbuds for the trip. My girlfriend came with me to the shop. Once there my girlfriend decided that she would like a pair of airpods. I relented and bought her a pair and got myself some Bose earbuds since I prefered those and I do not have an iphone. \n\nOn our way back to the unveristy she mentioned that she liked my earbuds since they looked better than her airpods. She took them, paired them to her phone, and started playing around with them, I didn't think much of it until she said she wanted them and wanted to trade her airpods with my earbuds. \n\nI told her no because I didn't have an iphone so airpods would be useless to me(found out later that they work pretty well on android) and that we can exchange hers when I get back since going back now would make her late for curfew. She kept insisting saying that it would make her happy, I told her I needed them for my trip in the morning which seemed to be the end of it.\n\nWe got to her residence and as I was parking she threw her airpods at me and said, \"thanks for the trade\" then jumped out of the moving car, still wearing my earbuds! I was shocked and it took me a second to realise that she had just ran away with my earbuds. I parked and then ran after her, but i wasn't fast enough, she had already entered the building.\n\nI stood at the entrance with two very burly guards giving me the stink eye while I shouted for her to come back, she just blew me a kiss and went up stairs.\n\nI shouted a bit more until the guards very \"politely\" asked me to leave. \n\nI was livid.\n\nShe had just robbed me and there was nothing I could do. I stalked back to my car fuming and cursing. \n\nHowever, I started laughing when I got to my car because, there on the ground, near the passenger side door, was a lovely white box. It seems in her mad dash to run away she had accidentally dropped the charging case.\n\nI picked it up, my day suddenly brighter, and drove back to the shop. I exchanged the AirPods and got new earbuds then blocked her and the next morning went for my road trip.\n\nI unblocked her when I got back yesterday ready to deal with the shit storm and called her.\n\nAt first she was sweet and asked about my trip. Then she asked if she had left the charging case for \"her\" earbuds in my car. I told her that I had returned the Airpods and exchanged them for new earbuds and that since my new earbuds didn't work with \"my\" old charging case I had thrown it away because I didn't need it. That triggered her and she started shouting at me, calling me an asshole and demanding that I get her a new pair of earbuds or we're done. \n\nI said \"ok, I guess we're done\" then hung up. \n\nI've been laughing ever since.\n\n**tl;dr:** My girlfriend stole my earbuds but left the charging case, now she has no boyfriend and no earbuds.",

Hotness alone wouldn\u2019t suffice for that, unless maybe the partner had no spine whatsoever. People are in the fog (it happens in all gender constellations) and then it takes sth as egregious as this to make them suddenly see the light. \n\nThe problem is that the first impression is really as powerful as it\u2019s said to be: once they\u2019re convinced someone is lovely, most people will not easily realise the opposite. Abusers and entitled assholes like his ex often take advantage of that by being extra-super-saccharine-sweet in the beginning \u2014 a technique called lovebombing. \n\nAnd then it just gradually escalates so the partner is confused and like \u201cHuh? What the hell is going on? But they\u2019re such a sweetheart usually..? No, this can\u2019t be, I must be misunderstanding sth/must be overreacting/must\u2019ve done sth wrong /etc. etc.\u201d which is ofc all reinforced gratuitously by the manipulator.\n\nThere\u2019s also the cases where such an incident is kind of a first-timer (well, at least at this level of seriousness) that *seems* to come out of the blue. Looking back, OP will probably see the pieces fall into place and form a pattern. During that year, various foreshadowing incidents at the time might\u2019ve appeared just as cheeky in a cute way. \n\nLike grabbing food from his plate, \u201cforgetting\u201d to bring back that cozy hoodie he gave her, stuff like that. Stealing his earbuds \u201cplayfully\u201d, she thought, would appear like she was just kidding a bit and if he\u2019d still be pissed off after the roadtrip, she might\u2019ve expected to tell him they\u2019d  \u201cshare\u201d them at most, except sharing would mean she\u2019d get them all the time, or that he\u2019d just buy himself new ones and that\u2019s that.\n\nApparently extremely spoiled and not used to consequences \u2014 and OP might\u2019ve reacted good-natured and patient to previous boundary testing, which such folks always take for weaknesses to exploit. Until they go too far and it turns out the other actually has a spine and was only being kind before.",

Women who are lukewarm or do not enjoy giving oral sex are usually mediocre to downright terrible at it, so the man has to work much harder to climax. So if you're receiving one from a woman who does not enjoy giving oral sex, it is normal to not climax (or to take an inordinately long time to climax).",

You can file warranty claims for loss/damage, so if your $250 Bose earbuds have *gone missing somehow*, you can get reimbursed for the full replacement value. I'm not sure if the warranty is valid in every country or just in North America, but it's still worth a shot.",

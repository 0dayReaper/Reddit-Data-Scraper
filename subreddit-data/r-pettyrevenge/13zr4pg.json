    "postText": "So I am currently sat on the bus with an extra smug look on my face being glared at as I type this mini story. So as people know about the British, we are known for our queueing etiquette and do not appreciate being cut in front of. \n\nNow I have just finished a 10hr shift at work and was waiting at the bus station for my bus to go home. I had been waiting at the stop for around about half an hour and was at the front of the queue, resting myself against some railings scrolling through my phone. Well as the bus arrives and I push myself off of the railings and walk to the bus, a stroller quite literally almost knocks me off of my feet and shoves past me to get on the bus, followed by 2 more strollers from the same family. Now I could have just grumbled and let it go, because hey we are all getting on the same bus right? But no... not me.\n\nSo in my pure petty nature I walk around these people to be the first person on the bus sitting myself in one of the priority seats in front of the wheelchair area where I knew these people would put their strollers and then I waited. So as this convey of strollers came on the bus and finally squeezed their strollers with children on the bus, they realised that I and my bag had occupied their seats and an elderly gentleman had occupied the seats on the otherside. Whoopsie.\n\nThey then decided to ask/demand that I move from my seat so they could sit down to which I responded with a smile, 'I'm sorry, you should have gotten on the bus sooner' then put my headphones on and blasted the sweet tunes of the Kinks (Big fan of Waterloo Sunset and Sunny Afternoon). So as stated these ladies are stood there glaring me as I write this post and enjoy the sweet tunes of revenge.\n\nAnd remember do not cut a queue in the UK.",

Apparently I was supposed to let her on first? IDK but it also was a journey full of glaring. \n\nI still think about her sometimes and wonder if she's broken her umbrella against anyone else's legs yet",

Suddenly there was an announcement in German and everyone stood up and rushed out of the train. We didn\u2019t speak German. My mom wondered if there was a bomb or something. A very kind woman noticed our confusion and explained there was an incident on the tracks ahead and they were bringing buses to take passengers around the issue. We got off and very politely stood in line with the crowd to get on a bus. We had been on the last train out so we HAD to get on the bus. Right when we reached the door, 3 nuns rushed up and actually tried to physically push my mom out of the way. My mother, who went to Catholic school growing up, was having NONE OF THAT. She elbowed the lead nun back and jumped on the bus. I let the nuns go, knowing full well my mom was saving me a seat. It was glorious.",

This dad shoves his way to the front with an 8 or 9 year old.  As soon as the doors open, the kid and I bolt up the stairs to the front row (glass over looks).  The kid beats me by 2 steps.   He tries to claim both sides of the front row for his family.   I told him he couldn't save seats and plopped my butt into one of the seats.  I then made numerous loud comments about rude people cutting the line.  After we stopped to take a tour of a building, we noticed that the family no longer sat in the front row next to us. I was 25 at the time!    I'm sure those people still talk about the rude person that was on the bus with them.  It still makes me laugh!",

Just as I get to the front of the queue with only one or two people behind me I see the guy I recognise from around the town with a girlfriend. I worked in a customer facing roll and i saw them clock me and who I was. They then stand near the front but just off to the side pretending not to be in the queue and just talking to each other. This person is not a nice guy and you see him regularly out of his head on drugs. Anyway I knew what he was doing and as my taxi pulled up and I took hold of the handle and as I started to open it he grabbed for the door and tried to push it open enough so he could get in before me. For some reason this time I was all \u201chell no he is not\u201d and forcefully pushed the door back closed on him. He looked at me and swore and tried to open it again as I\u2019m once again forcing it shut telling him I was first that he doesn\u2019t get to cut in. He starts shouting and swearing that \u201cI\u2019m B\u201d and other delightful things whilst leaning in to get in my face thinking he would intimidate me. I pull myself to my full height standing over him showing him I\u2019m not backing down and I\u2019m like \u201cYEAP I sure am and you\u2019re not getting this taxis\u201d. ( I\u2019m not a b I just don\u2019t like standing in the dark alone for hours feeling vulnerable whilst in pain then have Aholes like this). Angry as hell he stormed off swearing dragging his gf and walked right in front of the next person as they went to their taxi. They of course let them take it while looking surprised at me that a woman stood this person down.\n\nIn the uk we get queue jumpers all the time and sometimes I may let it go and think it isn\u2019t worth the hassle but it was dead at night and I physically was struggling standing as long being disabled. Yet I think it was more the fact he was trying to covertly do this thinking he\u2019d get less hassle than if he straight up pushed in front if everyone. He thought grabbing the door last minute would get him it. Also because he targeted me thinking I\u2019d be a walk over as the only lone woman.\n\nTaxi drivers and other services usually don\u2019t get involved even if they see the person push in as they don\u2019t want abuse or hassle.\n\nOnce in the taxis and on my way i then thought that wasn\u2019t exactly the smartest thing to do.",

My aim by sitting in 2 of these priority seats was just to make their ride home less comfortable. If someone with any of the following came on the bus whom required those priority seats, I would have moved no question to allow them to sit down and chose to sat on another seat. However, this convoy was very capable and after shoving past me and trying to jump to the front of the queue, I decided to sit myself in the seats the parents would have sat in, they as a result stood the journey back whilst I sat myself down, nice and comfortably. Now if this was a game of AITA, yeah maybe I am and maybe I could have let it go but I didn't.

    "postText": "Revenge is a dish best served cold right? Well, this dish has been chilling for years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt least a year ago, my wife honked at someone that was in the inner turn lane. My wife was in the outer turn lane. This person failed to maintain their lane, and almost hit my wife while they completed their turn. The driver was pissed that she honked, and proceeded to follow my wife home. I have dashcam footage (if anyone wants it), and got their plate.  \n\n\nIt turns out, they live in a complex across from us. I found out where they live too. However, in the interest of not crapping where one eats, I held off from egging their place to hell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months ago, they moved away. I was happy to see them leave. Yesterday, I see a car weaving in and out of lanes behind me. They end up slightly in front of me, and it's same douchebag (surprise surprise right?). I guess they didn't move too far, or were in the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get behind them, since I had a turn coming up. I gestured to my dashcam while I was behind them, and shook my finger at them. I wanted to mess with them a bit. When they had to turn, I decided I could take a slightly different route to my destination. Douchebag must have thought I was following them, because they dived into the nearest driveway for an office complex. Were they going to work? Sure, maybe... However, it's a tech company's parking lot. I don't think most people that work there work on Sundays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt could be just a coincidence, but I'd like to think they panicked. Was this revenge? I'll let you guys be the judge of that haha.\n\nEdit for clarification: He turns right to get to his complex. We go straight and then turn left. He followed my wife home deliberately.",

Go anywhere except home, preferably someplace populated and well lit.\n\nIf no police station is handy or you're worried about discrimination, pull into the hospital's emergency room and stop at the entrance.  They have cameras and people are actively watching that entrance.  A restaurant or hotel with valet parking is also a good option.  Odds are good that if you pull up and tell the valet what's going on, they'll give you a hand.  \n\nNo matter which you choose, there's a good chance the person following you will give up if you pull into one of these three places.",

With drive offs being not uncommon it's important to be able to read the license plate of vehicles pulling into the gas station. To not have any cameras is unheard of. Gas stations here typically have multiple cameras both outside and inside. Additionally cashiers usually have access to a silent panic button in the event of a robbery.",

But it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth when someone assumes bad intentions  when there's perfectly good explanations available. What if the neighbor was just driving home? Then OP would be an absolute maniac chasing this man down flipping him off *to the point of making him scared enough to pull into a parking lot*. This story only works if he actually was following OP's wife home, but there's *plenty* of reasonable explanations for why someone who lives across from you might take a slightly different way home that doesn't involve following someone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\u200b",

Especially since op literally said what I told you I'm a file up comment.\n\nWhat I think is the most likely scenario is that OP's neighbor drove home and took a slightly different way that day. OP assumed he followed his wife home and got *very angry* without actually knowing if the neighbor was following or not. Since they lived in the area, it's extremely likely that they were just going a different route that day for any amount of reasons. Either way, OP has no real way of knowing if they were following or not, does he?",

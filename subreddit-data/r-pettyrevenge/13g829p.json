    "postText": "To start this story happened when I was 12 and my sister was 13. My sister had found out Twilight was in theaters and as she was a die hars fan, wanted to go. Her friends were busy and my mom refused to let her go alone, so she convinced me to tag along. We lived in a small town and my sis had a prepaid phone with enough minutes to call parents to get us after movie. We sit through the movie and 12 year old me got really bored really fast. When the movie ended, however, she was supposed to call our mom so she could pick us up. But my sister had another plan in mind. We ended up walking to the JC Penny's where we met a boy from her class. They talked and I was just bored. Soon enough, my mom started calling and demanding to know where we were. My sister lied in the phone saying I was taking too long in the bathroom because of my period. I was mad at her for one lying and two using my period as a cover. Once off the phone my sister kissed the boy, then dragged me off to meet up with our mom. Once in the car, my mom went off on me for not having enough pads/tampons on me. I tried to explain that wasn't the case, but my mom made up her mind.\n\nLater my sis thanked me for not blowing her cover. And she also said that she owed me one.\n\nA few months later and I forgot about the whole thing until my sis invited said boy to our place for dinner. Things were fine. My parents liked the boy and I was just being a moody preteen who would rather be doing anything than hanging out with my sister's boyfriend. However, it wasn't until her bf made a comment towards me about my period when my parents were listening, bringing up the lie my sis told my mom. My sis and her bf laughed and I was embarrassed. \n\nSo I decided to get back. We were having hotdogs over a fire for dinner. And when my sis and her bf got up to get their hotdogs on buns, I decided while holding the ketchup to spray it on my sis's chair while my parents talking among themselves. My sis and her bf didn't noticed it, and she sat in it. At first she was confused and then stood up. Her bf commented that she said in something red. And then I commented something along the lines of her not being prepared for her period, sort of like the manner they were teasing me.\n\nSure, I was in trouble for the ketchup moment, but it felt so good to see mysisuncomfortable the same way she and her bf made me feel at 12 years old.",

Also she used to get arrested and she would tell the cops she was me. I actually had a background check for an apartment come back with all the things she was charged but not convicted for as they would realize that she wasn't me, but all those charges would show up anyways. I had a tough time convincing them that wasn't my record. After she died I got a bill for cellphones in her and her boyfriends numbers.I only recognized her number and I didn't even have a cellphone as I didn't think I had good enough credit at the time. But after she died I was relieved that I would not have these problems. Every time I would start to miss her, something she stole my identity for would pop up and I would have to deal with it. I really just wanted to miss my sister but it was almost 10yrs before I didn't have some zombie debt of hers to pay for. I miss her terribly but am grateful for no more surprises from her.",

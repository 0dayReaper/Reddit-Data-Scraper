    "postText": "This happened during my junior year of college. I (Claire) lived with five other women. (I'll call them Abby, Brooke, Dani, Ella, and Fran.)\n\nWhen we signed the lease on the house, we agreed to a one-year deal (June 1-May 31). The house was off-campus and unfurnished, so we needed things to make it feel like home. Prior to moving in, we all sat down and decided what we needed for the house and who was going to bring what and also settled on a chore schedule. We also decided that we'd have a household supply fund set up so we could buy things we all would use like toilet paper, paper towels, dish detergent, and laundry detergent. As it turns out, Dani, Ella, Francesca and I brought most of the stuff we needed like a couch, small dining table, dishes, silverware, drinking glasses, cookware, food storage containers, etc.\n\nThings went pretty well during fall semester. Shortly after that, however things started to decline. Abby's boyfriend Andy basically moved in with us and the two of them started acting like they owned the place. Left a dirty dish in the sink? They'd leave a passive-aggressive note about how rude it was to do that. Come home after the library closed at midnight? Abby and Andy went to bed at 10 and if you woke them up there was hell to pay. Pretty soon, Brooke and her boyfriend Brad were acting in much the same way. \n\nBy early February, it was clear to Dani, Ella, Fran, and me that we did not want to live with Abby and Brooke another year. The four of us found a different off-campus place and signed a lease. We let Abby and Brooke know and from then on, the two of them, plus their boyfriends, went from partial jerks to complete jerks. They'd do things like stop the clothes washer mid-wash, take our clothes out, dump them on the floor, and start their own laundry. They'd use up all the hot water by taking super long showers. They'd write \"return to sender\" on our mail. They destroyed flowers our boyfriends sent or brought to us. They refused packages. They stopped contributing to the shared supply fund and stopped doing chores. \n\nAbout a  week before Memorial Day, Ella got a call from the landlord on our new place saying the previous tenants had moved out and we could move in early if we'd like at no charge. Dani, Ella, Fran, and I discussed it and decided to get out of our current house ASAP but didn't tell Abby and Brooke of our plans.\n\nMemorial Day weekend rolls around and Abby, Brooke, and their boyfriends head out of town to go camping while the rest of us put our plan into action. With the help of friends, Dani, Ella, Fran, and I got all of our stuff moved out. And when I say all, I mean **all**\\--living room furniture, dining room furniture, dishes, silverware, cookware, food storage containers, baking supplies, shower curtain, rugs, lamps, vacuum, broom, dustpan, etc. We also decided that since neither Abby nor Brooke had contributed to the shared household supply fund since March, the toilet paper, paper towels, dish detergent, laundry detergent, and so forth was ours, so we took all of that too. \n\nAbby, Brooke, and their boyfriends were shocked to return from their camping trip to an empty house. What made our petty revenge even sweeter was that on their way home from the camping trip, all four of them got food poisoning and were really, really sick. The scathing texts we got about moving out unannounced AND taking all shared household goods--especially the toilet paper? Priceless. Dani, Ella, Fran, and I are great friends still get a good laugh about the situation about 12 years later. None of us have heard from Abby or Brooke since graduation.",

Legally, I can live 4 people in the apartment at max and past that number I am subject to eviction. Some places (most common) limit occupancy to the people listed on the lease, and any roommates must be added to the lease. Should someone get a key and start living there without notification? Legal eviction.\n\nI 100% agree that this situation should be discussed and agreed to prior to signing a lease, but do check local laws and your lease.

However, why not name them by their relevant descriptions and not bother calling them anything else? All we care about is understanding their significance to the story. For me, it is easier to remember that \"Boss\" is the boss, and that \"Coworker\" is the coworker, instead of having to look back and see which one is \"John\" or \"Jane\". \n\nIt is even worse when the poster does random initials like you used in your example [\"There's D (my boss) and Q (my co-worker)\"]. If they feel they want to use initials, they could at least stay with There's B (my boss) and C (my co-worker) so we can automatically fill in the rest in our heads.",

It turns out that she told the RA that my BF was living in the room and it\nBothered her. This was not true so I shared info about her BF. I later learned that she was pregnant, had a miscarriage in a garage bathroom and flunked out. I was the scapegoat! It was great not having a roommate. I had 2 closets, and room to spread out.

While she was at work one day (I made sure she was going out clubbing afterwards which she did regularly) I called my help and gave them the green light to come over. We moved all of my stuff out that I had secretly been boxing up in my room for a couple of weeks and everything else that was mine as well.

            "comment": "My wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) had a similar situation in college. She signed a lease for a house with 4 other girls. My wife\u2019s parents moved overseas into a furnished flat the summer before she was to move into the house so they gave her the furniture they couldn\u2019t take with them, which furnished all of the common living areas in the house. They also gave her their kitchen items. Things went downhill pretty quickly when the girls all moved in together in September. To keep the story short I won\u2019t get into the details of why, but by January my wife had pretty much sequestered herself to her room, or hung out at my apartment. She still got along with one of the girls but their rooms were in opposite sides of the house so they only spent time together outside of the house, and the friend also stayed out of the common areas because of how terrible the rest of the roommates behaved. And she had also supplied the remainder of the common/shared items which my wife had not. Essentially the 3 other girls were massive slobs who did no cleaning, and gave no fucks about how they treated the common area furniture. They would use all the pots and pans but never clean them. And one of the girls had her girlfriend living there, who was also a massive slob, and she wasn\u2019t paying rent or contributing to anything. \n\nSo the two girls decided since the other roommates made it so unpleasant to use the common areas, they would take all of their stuff from those areas. I had an apartment with extra space so we found a time when my roommates and I were free while the four other girls were in class or working, and we went over and cleaned out all of the common area furniture that belonged to my wife and her friend. The friend\u2019s boyfriend also helped out, so when the other 4 girls (3 actual roommates plus the freeloading girlfriend) came home and found an empty living room, dining room, and kitchen, the two girls told them that since they (my wife and her friend) weren\u2019t using their stuff and their boyfriends needed it, they could have it. \n\nThe four shitty roommates started to throw a fit bit both girls just said you didn\u2019t pay for any of those things, and you\u2019ve been such slobs that we can\u2019t use them, so we took our shit.

            "comment": "My lousy roommate was my sibling. We both lived with our mother - I was 19F at the time, full-time college, part-time work; he was 21M, unemployed. He'd been in a relationship for a while, and she was also unemployed. Neither of them were claiming any employment support benefits, so neither made any contributions to rent, utilities, or food. As I was still in full-time education, my father still paid my Mum \u00a3150 a month in maintenance, \u00a3100 of which was classed as rent (including utilities), \u00a350 a month as an allowance to buy clothes, etc. I earned \u00a330 a week at my job, \u00a320 of which I gave Mum for food, the rest I used for specialist stuff as I have food intolerances and had been vegan for 5 years. This arrangement between my Mum and me had been in place for about 3 years by this point. \n\n Mum told him explicitly NOT to move his girlfriend in, but he did anyway. They spent most of their time having sex - something else my Mum didn't want in her house - or they were watching TV. In the entire year previously, neither had made any attempt to find work, nor had they registered at the Job Centre. Any food in the house was consumed by them both without replacement or reimbursement. Girlfriend would only eat chicken, potatoes, and chocolate ice cream. It got to the point that this was the only food available as Mum catered to their whims, literally. Considering my issues with food, I was not impressed that the only food available to me was things I didn't or couldn't eat, so I stopped paying the \u00a320 and bought everything for myself. Knowing that neither sibling nor girlfriend were likely to eat my food, it was safe to do so. I would often cook meals to share with Mum as she was vegetarian. \n\n As I said, this went on for about a year. The breaking point was when Mum asked me to contribute more money to cover their lack of funding. She wanted all of my wages each week, knowing I couldn't earn more, because they weren't contributing. I put my foot down and refused - I was not going to give up my food money to cover two leaches and not have anything I could actually eat in the home. I told her that either she told them to get jobs and start helping out or find somewhere else to live. She actually did this, and they got all salty about it and moved into girlfriends' parents' house. They were apparently okay with them freeloading. It is something he has never forgiven me for and something I have no regrets about. Our outgoings reduced immensely after they left, and there was always food we could eat available.",

It helps my own inner wounds of terrible awful selfish and dirty roommates of my junior yar at uni.\n\nAlso thank you for your use of names AND for alphabeticalizing them for easy tracking.

    "postText": "Back in fall of 2018, I scored a seasonal gig as a production assistant for a weeks-long art festival in the Midwest. I loved the other production assistants I worked with - we were a pretty motley crew in terms of age and interests but somehow hit it off really well as a group. Even upper management was awesome, so we had a lot of fun together. Suffice to say I loved my coworkers - all but one. Let's call her Condescending Connie.  \n\nAt our morning stand-ups, Condescending Connie managed to take credit for everything that got done the day before, despite not having lifted a finger to help us. She even managed to aim subtle put-downs to the person who actually did the work without her help, implying that WE were the ones who sat on our asses! She never outright said this though, she was careful to toe the line short of saying outright lies we could call her out on, but of course this didn't sit right with me.  \n\nSo, one of my tasks as a production assistants was stocking and tagging merchandise for the art festival's gift shop. Just after I finished using the tagging gun to price some t-shirts, Condescending Connie threw her jacket behind the shop counter (ignoring my hello) and walked back out again. I don't know what synapses fired in my brain to give me this idea, but I picked up her jacket and took out the pricing gun to punch a price tag fastener through the clothing label. (You know, one of those little pieces of plastic that get left behind on the label when you try to rip the price tag off by hand.) I don't know what I was thinking, but I put her jacket away a little happier knowing it might be a mildly irritating inconvenience.   \n\nWouldn't you know it, a few weeks later I was again tasked with pricing new hats and shirts and such and noticed that Condescending Connie had left her jacket behind. She had apparently removed the little plastic nib I left earlier, so I took the liberty of punching a new one in.   \n\nThis continued over the course of my seasonal job. Every 2-6 weeks or so, I would sporadically punch a little price tag fastener through the hats and scarves and jackets she left behind the counter. Because Condescending Connie had never actually seen anyone use the pricing gun, and because it's such a minor little thing to happen over the course of multiple articles of clothing over months of time, it never seemed to occur to her that someone was doing this behind her back. I'm pretty sure she legitimately questioned her sanity by the end, wondering if she could trust her clear-as-day memories of cutting the plastic tag piece away only to find it intact days or weeks later. One afternoon in the lunch room I overheard Condescending Connie talking to someone on the phone and actually saying something to the effect of \"I think I'm losing my mind.\" That made me feel guilty enough that I decided to address her later and own up to my prank, but as soon as she ended the call I heard her raise her voice with an elderly volunteer for setting some pamphlets down in the wrong area. So, needless to say, I kept going. \n\nEven when she moved her jacket and bags and such to different hiding spots, I found ways to smuggle in the price gun and punch in another tag fastener.\n\nI regret nothing. :)\n\nETA: I love your deliciously petty ideas, though they all would have confirmed someone was actively tampering with her things and probably would've got me in trouble lol",

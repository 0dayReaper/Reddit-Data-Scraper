    "postText": "I helped my friend during the COVID-19 vaccination program in my community. After the program, she introduced me to the rest of the team. She told them that I used to work for the same company. And then this one nurse raised her eyebrow and loudly said \u201coh you\u2019re one of those who got laid off during the pandemic huh?\u201d, i felt overwhelmed on her remarks, but my friend said \u201coh no, she resigned on her position because she\u2019s attending medical school to become a medical doctor\u201d. The nurse was stunned and quietly apologized. I guess my friend got my back on putting judgmental people on their places.",

Not all that many people were coming in, but the ones who were typically were sick as shit. But it doesn\u2019t require a high VOLUME of staff to care for half a dozen ventilators, and one of the primary steps in reducing spread was to minimize exposure. So yeah, like 10-15% of our staff were laid off. Many were brought back when flu season kicked up, but some weren\u2019t.",

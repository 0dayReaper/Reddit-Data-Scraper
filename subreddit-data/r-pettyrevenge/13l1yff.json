    "postText": "This is my friend\u2019s story so I will share it from their perspective. \n\nSo, I (ftm) am really good at rounders, I know how to smack the living daylights out off a ball and can run fast. Good child (f) is also really good but this is mainly about me and a few others. \n\nSo, me, Speedy (f), and nice person (f) really wanted to bat first so we grabbed some bats then stood by the others, but apparently they were a few people short on the fielding team and every single person on the team voted for us three to go to. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE THE START OF SCHOOL!! Nice person folds and goes to the fielding team and good child goes with them but you could see all the fielding team roll their eyes at her being in their team. \n\nIt was then that me and Speedy mutually decided to be absolutely terrible just to tick them off. \n\nI went before speedy. Good child was the wicket keeper (wrong game but that's what they called her) and when I walked up she was immediately like \"you're gonna be really petty, aren't you?\" Good child knows me pretty well, well enough to know when I'm about to be the most annoying person on earth. So I was like \"Yep!\" and she started laughing a bit. I timed everything perfectly, I waited until it looked like I was gonna hit it and then swing right underneath. They were screaming at me and I just started humming and Good child was laughing and it was great. I missed the first two and if I missed the third I was required to \"run\" to the first post. I missed it and walked there, as slow as I possibly could. The fielding team didn't even bother trying to get me out. Anyway, I got to the second post and the girl standing there was like \"you need to run because if (the girl behind me) overtakes you you'll both be out\" and I was fully like \"oh but you're just tempting me to walk even more\" So yeah, I walked and forced the girl behind me to walk too. When I got back everyone was super livid and I just scowled at them, turned to speedy and was like, in the most sing-song voice you can imagine \"heya, (speedy), how you doin'\" Speedy then did the exact same thing I did and I cheered them on the entire way.\n\nIt felt so FRIKIN GOOD!!!",

Revenge happens when OP (but not OP) walks instead of running forcing follow up teammate to also walk as to not force a double out. Then on way back, OP asks other friend on batting team how they doing, other batting friend repeats process.",

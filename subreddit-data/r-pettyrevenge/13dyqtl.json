    "postText": "The anime t-shirt post reminded me of something that happened a long time ago with my dear, departed FIL. \n\nHe grew up very lower middle class and hated it. As a result, he dedicated his life to bettering himself to jump classes. He became a fairly respected philosophy professor and ONLY listened to classical music. He could tell which composer was which and even the differences between performances. Meanwhile, one of his brothers pursued the more criminal element. The other brother became a professional musician on the much less classical side. \n\nHe had that practiced academic sniff of disdain down to a science. He wasn't mean and he liked me, but I'm sure that it irked him that his daughter married a college dropout who wound up becoming a failed actor. \n\nFor years, we'd vacation with FIL and MIL for two weeks. It was lovely, usually. The drive to meet them took about two days so we'd load up the kids with audio books and music. At around five, one of my daughters started listening to soundtracks of classic Disney movies like Snow White, Cinderella and the like; very dramatic and classically based. I think she just liked the covers of the CDs at first. \n\nOne day, FIL got into the gin and became a little more unbearable than usual. We needed at run to the grocery store and he said he'd come along. Cinderella was in the car CD player. Of course, he's listening closely and doing the professorial beard stroke thing. \n\n\"Hey, FIL, who do you think this composer is?\"\n\nHe spent about 5mins listening even more closely and muttering composer names to himself and rejecting them. He finally gave up. \n\n\"Yes, FIL, that's the soundtrack to Cinderella,\" I said with a bit of a smirk.\n\nBut for all his faults, FIL had a great sense of humor and chuckled, \"You got me.\"",

            "comment": "To be fair, classical musicians usually have years of schooling for their profession, while contemporary musicians usually have just enough theory to know what key they're in. I love contemporary music and enjoy it way more, and it definitely still takes a lot of skill. It's just a different sound, and it does objectively take more knowledge to perform. I can't fault anyone for liking it, even if it's the only genre they like.. so long as they don't put down others.",

He always wanted you to know that he had taste and judgment. \n\nI visited him in memory care once and they had a sing along with lyric books. He had no idea what was going on but he knew what a book was. He fingered and said in his familiar authoritative tone, \"This.....................is a very good....................book.\" I agreed. And he was very pleased by that.",

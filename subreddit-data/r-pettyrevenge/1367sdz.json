    "postText": "I used to live in a multi level apartment complex in a large city that is well known for having very expensive carparking. I had two dedicated car parking spaces (back to back) allocated to my apartment.\n\nI used to sublease the car park space to a friend that would park his car on work days. Often on a Friday night he would taxi home after Friday night drinks and leave his car. He would then come in on the Saturday or Sunday and pick it up. Often, he would park me in, but this wasn\u2019t an issue as we had access to each other\u2019s cars.\n\nA new neighbour moved into the complex and unfortunately for me that neighbour turned out to be a real dick. They would often see my spaces free and park me in or tell their visitors to park me in. I would often had to call them or go see them and ask for them to move their cars. It became such an issue that I had them on speed dial.\n\nWe tried several things to stop them parking in our spots, such as putting in bollards or parking in the front spot and moving the cars when we needed to park. But they would end up parking us in and parking illegally.\n\nMy friend got so frustrated and said he would stop subleasing from me which was not a big deal as it was only an arrangement of convenience for both of us.\n\nIn Australia, it is very difficult to enforce parking on private property. It is basically illegal to tow, clamp or detain a car. So building management couldnt really help besides putting warning stickers and writing letters.\n\nI talked to a lot of the residents in the complex and they where having the same problems. Cue revenge. I joined the strata committee which consists of all the owners and after 6 months got elected as the president which wasnt hard as only a hand full of residents would actively participate.\n\nI then got the common areas, which included visitor parking to be managed by the council. We had to pay a fee but it was worth it.\n\nWhen council started to patrol the common areas, the offending cars got fined pretty heavily till they were removed. I saw at least 5 tickets (each approx. $250) on 3 of the cars. In addition, one of the cars wasn't even registered and was ticketed for abandonment and was eventually removed.\n\nThis didn't resolve the private car parking issues. So I had by laws drafted, that if residents let visitors into the private carpark instead of using the visitor parking, their access would be \"reassessed\". This meant that their access FOBs (Keys) would be disabled until the residents confirmed and accepted the by laws. This meant that the offending residents, which were renters were constantly calling their landlord and complaining as we disabled the FOBs everytime we caught them using it to let visitors in. Of course it took 24 hours and an administrative fee to reactivate the FOBs....\n\nEventually, I got the carpark upgraded and the carpark key FOB system removed and replaced with number plate identification instead. I've since moved out, but as I still own the property and am still on the strata committee I'm still well informed. I am happy to report that there are no more parking issues :P",

The tax for doing so was the finest and having my time wasted. \n\nI did have a problem with the boot because I supposedly received three tickets on the same day and time but there was only one ticket in the little envelope, and I paid it on my next payday, leaving two unpaid tickets. \n\nWhen I got another parking ticket I apparently had received a second one that same day and time, like before but there was only one ticket in the envelope. I paid the one ticket and eventually the, now, three outstanding tickets went to warnings and then to the boot department. \n\nAfter that I learned to look up my license plate monthly to make sure I didn't have tickets that I didn't actually receive.

Many of the By-Law officers, depending on the kinda day they are having, will stand there and ticket a vehicle back to back. Usually you need \u201cx\u201d amount of tickets or offences before you get towed. So they wait a few minutes and keep ticketing until they can call for a tow. It\u2019s technically legal, but personally, I think it\u2019s morally wrong. The impounds are the hardest part of my job.

The water pump failed.  It was a miserable, cold, day and drizzling freezing rain.  Fortunately, there was a \"mailbox driveway\" for us to get off the road.  We *were* technically blocking the mailbox, but it was also an emergency and well past mail time.  It's an extremely rural area.  The road has no shoulders and blind curves, it's well accepted that if someone breaks down they may need to be on \"your property\" for a little bit.  \n\nMy husband (at the time) was a mechanic and spent an hour getting the water pump off (we really couldn't afford a tow bill) and I called someone to give us a ride into the store (about six miles away) to buy a new one.  We were gone about half an hour because we took the time to get my husband some coffee to warm up before he went back in the cold to finish the job.\n\nThe house's owner wasn't home (or wouldn't answer the door) when we knocked so we left a note in the windshield as to what happened and when we'd be back, also apologizing for the inconvenience.\n\nWhen we got back, our car was gone.\n\nWe eventually got it out of the homeowner (who had apparently arrived home while we were gone) that he'd had our car towed and by what company.  He initially played dumb and then shouted at us for a long while before he'd admit he had it towed.\n\nBless that tow truck driver, though!  He'd been confused and then angry about being called in the circumstances (our note was still in  the windshield when he got there) and tried to refuse to tow it until after the time we said we'd return.  But the home owner was adamant so the driver towed our car away to protect it from the home owner who was threatening to damage it.  He then let us finish the repair in his lot (and even loaned us a tool we needed!) and didn't charge us for the tow.  Instead, he ate the cost and blacklisted the home owner who'd called him.",

I mostly drive shitty cars and I usually have some form of roadside, so I've called a lot of tow-trucks.  You very occasionally get a dick, but 99% of them just want to spend their forty hours helping folks.\n\nI once (many years ago) had a tow truck driver stop and help me change a tire while he was on the way to another job.  I was all but there, had the tire out and the lug nuts loose, but my jack wouldn't go up far enough.  Since I was all set up, the tow truck who was passing by got me changed in under two minutes, barely delaying their call and getting me back on the road in mere seconds opposed to my makeshift fixits.\n\nThere are benefits to a small town, too.  There are only three towing companies within an hour of me.  If one blacklists you you're in for a hurt.\n\nI've got so many stories...  One of my favorites took *years* to complete.  See, there's three \"towing companies\" in my county.  One only does tire changes, they dispatch a pick-up, usually, just to change tires.  The other two were once a single company.  But when the father died, his two sons split the family business, as they couldn't agree on most things.\n\nI say \"most\" because there was one thing the brothers agreed on that I didn't find out about until years later.\n\nThere's a non-zero chance of me doxxing my hometown, but here's the story.  Years ago my (at the time) fiance and I were moving his old car from his back yard to mine.  It wasn't properly registered but I did have insurance.  I'm usually a stickler for registration laws, but I ignored it this time in favor of moving the vehicle so my fiance could finish fixing it and get it on the road.\n\nBut that car broke down.  We went back to the house for parts and tools and when we returned, there was a police car waiting for us.  He'd already called a tow truck due to our lack of proper plates.  (Again, we had insurance, just no registration as it was a one-time move of said vehicle.  Yes, I'm aware now that there's a permit for that.  The nice Sheriff's deputy told me.)  The officer is still sitting there while my fiance drags the toolbox over and gets it going.  By this time, we have been there for over three hours and the cop is getting annoyed because his tow truck isn't there.\n\nSo I politely ask if, when the tow truck gets there, we can have it towed home instead of police impound.  The cop says he doesn't care, so I thank him and tell my fiance.\n\nAnother hour passes and the tow truck *still* hasn't arrived.  So I (the young, white, red-headed woman) ask the cop if we can just drive it home and he can bill us for the tow when it shows.  He's *furious* at this point because it's been *three fucking hours* and the tow truck hasn't arrived.  He *orders* us to just \"get it out of here\" and drives off as I ask if there's anything of his I can sign to make his job easier.  (I'm not a sycophant, just taking advantage of my large breasted \"polite\" voice.  More flies with honey, baffle them with bullshit, style)\n\nTwo years later, I managed to slide my car into a ditch.  The poor tow truck driver is literally scratching his head trying to figure out not only how the hell I got it down there without rolling it (the slope had to be at least 75 degrees!) but how he can get it back out without totaling it.  So while he's looking/thinking/scratching his scalp under his ballcap, I start chatting about his most random tows.\n\nAnd this man, without missing a beat, while slithering on his belly under my marooned car, comes out with the story of how his dad and his uncle couldn't agree on anything except how much they hated cops.  And being the only tow service in the county and having a contract with the sheriff's department, they *always* took as long as they could justify to meet police requests for a tow when the vehicle was off the road.\n\nThis was the same company I referenced above, who blacklisted a home owner for towing a car that wasn't actually in the way and had a designated time of return on a note in the windshield.  \n\nso the Dad blacklisted a shitty property owner, then the son saved us from a $300+ tow out of sheer obstinatence, and his brother's so later got me out of a ditch-loss that's *still* talked about to this day, with zero damage.  (it was truly impressive.  Even I have no idea why my car didn't roll; it should have.)\n\nObviously that's not a universal experience, but it's the kind of delightful thing that can happen in a small town.",

Everything else was guest (or extra tenants beyond the first).\n\nNow, there was a LOT of parking.  Between guest spots, street parking around the complex, and many renters only having a single vehicle, things were usually pretty good, and parking wasn't an issue.\n\nBut then one year we started to have a problem where parking was limited, and it seemed to just be ongoing - and it was bad enough that some guests (or those extra tenants) would use reserved spaces.\n\nIn the process of helping resolve that, I started paying attention to the vehicles in the guest spots.  Even though I was just a renter, I'd drive a loop around the lot (basically a big figure 8), and photograph the sets of guest parking spots.\n\nI did that every 2-3 days for 2 weeks, and then just brought all that in to the office.  We had 23 cars that literally had not changed which guest spot they were in (out of about 80-100 spots) in the entire 2 week period.  Plus there were more \"permanently parked\" vehicles out on the street.\n\nRental office took care of (towed) the ones in the parking lot, and I called the cops about the ones on the street.  2-3 weeks later, suddenly there was more than enough parking for everyone again.  LOTS of pissed off tenants who had been towed (they didn't have their added vehicles listed on their tenancy agreements), or whose friends/lovers/etc vehicle towed who had been staying with them (or even worse, just parked their car in the lot \"for safe keeping\" while they weren't using it).\n\nWas very glad the office took care of it, because it was frustrating telling friends they had to park effectively 3-4 blocks away when visiting, because all the guest spots were constantly in use.",

My roommate and I had copies of each others keys and could unblock ourselves as necessary. Then one day this random car was parked in our lane, up close behind my car so there was no maneuvering around it. I knocked on every apartment door and couldn\u2019t find the person, so I missed a class that day (not a huge deal). I should have just had the car towed, but I know it\u2019s really expensive to get your car back and I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt, so I just left a nice note on their car explaining the parking situation and asking them not to use our lane. A couple days later, the same damn car had blocked me in. I knock on all doors again, and leave another more aggressive note that next time this happens a I\u2019ll tow their car. The next week, I see the guy park his car behind mine and start to leave it, so I intercept him to say \u201chey, I need you to move your car, you\u2019re blocking me in.\u201d And he said \u201cno, there\u2019s no assigned parking, I can park there.\u201d I stared at him for about 5 seconds before saying \u201cfirst, the apartment number listed at the top of the lane tells you whose lane that is. Second, how the fuck would that even work if it were the case?? You honestly think this is a system where we all have to roll the dice in whether we\u2019ll be able to use our own fucking car that day?\u201d He looked dumbfounded, like it literally hadn\u2019t occurred to him that the system he thought was in place could not possibly work. I truly don\u2019t understand how an adult could be that blind to incredibly simple logistics. He just kind of muttered \u201cwhatever\u201d and moved the car, and it wasn\u2019t a problem again. To this day, I\u2019m at a loss as to how he thought that was supposed to go.",

I have a scrape on the side of my car (from hitting the column) because she would never leave me any room. One time I had to park on the left side of her because she parked so far over my line. (Yes there was so much room to the left of her that I could park there and not be in anyone's way, yet she still chose to be on my line). \n\nScrew you lady. You were the worst. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

    "postText": "After seeing another thread about someone playing themselves, I thought I\u2019d throw this out there.  TL:DR at bottom. \n\nYears ago, I worked at a small real estate office on a very busy corner in a Chicago suburb. We got an inordinate amount of beggars. \n\nOne morning, I come in, get my morning activities done, and I notice a lot of our plants are drooping. I figured I\u2019d water them while taking a break. Since the secretary usually does this, I ask the secretary if she has a pitcher she usually uses. She tells me this day (I think it was a Friday) is when she feeds the plants. \n\nShe tells me to take a super heaping big scoop of plant food, dissolve it into a thin slurry with a little water, and then pour a little in each plant before coming back to water the plants with straight water. \n\nOk. So, I put a huge scoop in an empty Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee cup because I don\u2019t see a pitcher or bucket or anything substantial. (I assume you already see where this is going.)  I stir it up and it\u2019s kinda thick and blue.  I bring it to the secretary\u2019s desk. She starts laughing and says she dissolves it in a pitcher. She tells me where the pitcher is and puts a cover on the Dunkin\u2019 cup before she starts swirling it to mix it more.  \n\nThis gets really contrived, so I\u2019ll cut to the chase...  I get the pitcher and while I was in the kitchen filling it, I poured some coffee in regular glass mugs and brought it all up front for us. We\u2019re chatting when a beggar walks in. She\u2019s dressed normally and gives us the standard stories that are almost ALWAYS \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten in three days\u201d and \u201cI need to take a bus downtown for my AIDS treatment.\u201d  I don\u2019t know why they all use those two lines, but since we heard it a dozen times a day, we knew it was the standard scam. \n\nAnyway, she asks for money. We say no and she busts out another line we heard multiple times a day from beggars we turned down\u2026 \u201cYou rich real estate brokers are cheap assholes!\u201d  She finally she sees the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts cup. She asks if we can at least give her \u201ca couple dollars for a cup of Dunkin\u2019.\u201d We say no. She asks if we can give her a mug of coffee. We say no. I\u2019m not giving *anything* to someone who just called me a \u201ccheap asshole.\u201d\n\nShe says, \u201cFine!  I\u2019ll just take *this*!\u201d and she literally snatches the Dunkin\u2019 Cup from the secretary\u2019s hand.  She runs out triumphantly hollering something we didn\u2019t understand because we were in shock (and about to erupt with laughter). \n\nAnd now comes the self-revenge...  Two fold!!  Almost 3!!!  We watch through the wall of glass windows as she takes a big old healthy swig of Miracle-Grow and realizes she\u2019s got a mouth full of chemicals. \n\nShe doubles over and spits it all out. (Self revenge one.) She then whips the cup into the 95th Street traffic without looking and miraculously hits a squad car.  Thick blue miracle-grow sludge explodes across the side of the pristine white Evergreen Park police cruiser.  The cop immediately slams on his brakes and jumps out. She\u2019s coughing and spitting and hacking and pointing at us. The cop talks to her for a minute and then comes in with her and says she\u2019s claiming we deliberately gave her poisoned coffee. \n\nWe explain the situation and he mentions that he knows her because she panhandles at different businesses every day as she walks home from *work*.  Yes, work.  We later found out she\u2019s a teller at a bank down the street!!  We get her some water since she\u2019s looking a bit green around the gills.  This was the early days of decent security cameras, but we had one and it was all on tape.  The cop didn\u2019t even look at the footage and asks if we\u2019d like to have her arrested for stealing our plant food. \n\nHe\u2019s on the verge of laughing. We\u2019re already giggling since we know we\u2019re off the hook. The lady is blazing with anger and embarrassment and fear. We say not to arrest her since she punished herself for her stupidity. The cop then wrote her a ticket for $500 for littering. (Revenge two.)  I actually feel kind of bad about that. I think drinking Miracle-Grow was more than enough punishment and we were willing to let her go. \n\nRevenge 3 would have been us having her arrested, but we\u2019re not scumbags. \n\nA possible fourth revenge could have been a battery charge. Maybe a cop or lawyer can back me up here, but this cop said that assaulting a vehicle that a police officer is in can be construed as battery against the officer. He kept threatening her with a battery charge against him when she\u2019d start getting loud or bitchy. She wanted us to go to prison for trying to poison her and she kept spinning the story as if we invited her in and force-fed her a cup of cold blue slushy poison. She pushed that narrative even after we pointed out the camera and the secretary started queuing up the footage. It was almost comical how the cop completely dismissed the idea of the footage. He knew. He knew her. He knew her game. \n\nAnyway, after saying he could charge her with battery for the umpteenth time, she said, \u201cIt was just a cup!\u201d  He paused for a second and almost comically responded, \u201cOnly a few minutes ago, it was a cup of *poison* these people tried to *kill* you with!  So, you threw a cup of *POISON* at me that exploded all over my rig!?!  You intentionally threw *POISON* at me?!!  How is that *not* an attempt to harm?!?\u201d While I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s true about being able to charge her with battery, it certainly kept her in line as he sorted out what happened.\n\nTL;DR: Beggar steals a Dunkin Donuts cup full of plant food, drinks it, throws the cup at a cop while not looking, and gets herself a ticket for littering. Self-revenge at its finest.",

I don't recall what the sign said now, but the local news did a story on him after a few months, and had footage of him walking across the street to get into a nice SUV he'd parked at a gas station. \n\nHe actually talked to the reporter and told the story. He was working for a local law firm and had lost his job, so he started panhandling to make ends meet until he found a new job. Until he found out he could make more per hour than he had as an attorney. $600/hr, IIRC. Tax free. So he just kept doing it until he got caught and moved on.\n\nIf you think about the volume of cars that pass through an offramp an hour during the rush periods, if even 1% give an average of $5, that's far more money in a couple hours morning and evening than someone can make working an actual job.",

Utilizing the low cost of street living and high taxless income of panhandling to bounce back from zero. But I don't have any evidence that's what most panhandlers are doing. Seems clear most are supporting a drug habit or otherwise living rough to be separate from society while utilizing the existence of society to fund their lifestyle. \n\nReminds me of someone I knew who said people were chumps for buying food at the grocery store when you could just go by after hours and dumpster dive. Like, okay, but if everyone did that there wouldn't be a grocery store to mooch off of. You're complaining about a system that you owe your existence to, because if there wasn't waste for you to consume then you'd have to actually get a job and work to pay for the food before it becomes waste.",

There was an article in the Chicago Tribune maybe 5 years ago about a lady who panhandled at the corner of 143rd and Harlem Avenue.  I used to drive by and see her with her iPhone taking breaks.  The paper interviewed her because the jurisdiction changed and she wasn\u2019t going to be able to panhandle there anymore. They were wondering what she was going to do.  She didn\u2019t give her name and she didn\u2019t show her face, but she just said she was going to go a bit further south where the people were stingier in general, but the ones who have tended to give more. They asked how much she makes and she said she name over $150,000 the last year and that didn\u2019t include the ten five gallon buckets that were still all full of change in her garage. It\u2019s so crazy. (And now that I think of it, it may have been the The Daily Southtown newspaper in case anyone wants to try to hunt the story down.)",

The pan handlers would watch for people coming out and try to get them. Well from the north side it was a little difficult to see which door someone came out of, so they'd just go after anyone they saw walk out.  I'd get harassed by the same people with the same story every day. So many of them I'd watch park nice new cars in the parking garage.

I saw so many scams that I\u2019m just disgusted whenever I see a panhandler of any sort. I\u2019ll donate to shelters and churches and food pantries, but I\u2019ll never give a beggar anything anymore. \n\nI remember one guy was in a beat-up wheelchair looking all filthy with his camouflage army jacket and stained pants and nasty shoes. One of the other Realtors warned me about him being a scammer early on. We followed the guy one day and he rolled like two blocks down, went behind a gas station, got out of his wheelchair, and took off his nasty clothes. Underneath, he was wearing nice clothes. He changed his shoes, wiped his face, and then threw all his \u201cscammer clothes\u201d into the trunk of his Cadillac. This was 1999, and as a Cadillac enthusiast, I knew this was a 1998 Sedan DeVille. So, it\u2019s not like he was driving an old shitbox. This thing was like a year or two old at most. I\u2019ve got TONS of stories about these panhandling scammers. \n\nI had one tell me she needed money because she hadn\u2019t eaten in 3 days WHILE SHE WAS EATING A CHICKEN LEG!\n\nAnother was scary.  I had a client come in after work and we worked pretty late.  We finished up and the client left. I was by myself. It was about 9 or 9:30 PM. A grungy guy came in holding a Bible and telling me he had to visit his sick mother and he needed bus money. He threw in some stuff about spending his last two dollars on a bus transfer to get his AIDS treatment. He kept getting closer and I kept telling him to back off. I reached for the phone and said I was going to call the cops.  I don\u2019t want to get into a debate about guns, but he reached behind him and took a couple steps toward me.  That\u2019s when I pulled a .357 out of my desk and told him to fuck off. He turned around to run out. That\u2019s when I saw this big ass knife in his hand (it looked like the Rambo knife in the first movie). I really think he would have stabbed me and robbed me. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. I was only in my early 20\u2019s at this point. \n\nI did have one guy arrested. He came in to beg and I said no. He was clearly a junkie. He grabbed my laptop and told me he\u2019d give it back if I gave him everything I had. This was before I had a gun in my desk. I told him to put the computer down and I\u2019d give him all my cash. He put it down and I rushed him. I slammed his head into the floor till he passed out and I called the cops. Thank god for that camera in the office. Keep in mind I was probably 265 pounds at the time and he was no more than a buck twenty five. \n\nThe first time when I actually got taken, the guy gave me the bus money excuse. I gave him 5 bucks. I watched him pass the bus stop (which was 5 feet from the front door of our office) and go to the gas station next door. He walked out with a hot dog and a pack of cigarettes.  He ate his hot dog on the side of the building, smoked a couple cigarettes, and then some guy picked him up and they drove off. It happened one more time with another guy and that\u2019s when I lost faith in humanity. I was done with scammers. \n\nBelieve it or not, most were pleasant and even though we turned them away, they wished us a \u201cblessed day\u201d before leaving.  Most were polite, but we had some real crazy bastards too.",

If they were in the mood, they\u2019d hit up businesses along the main streets just to make extra money. I\u2019m sure some were homeless and hurting, but others were just scamming people. We had plenty of guys in suits come in and say they lost their wallet and needed money for gas. They always said they\u2019d pay us back. \u201cLook at me!  I\u2019m not homeless!  I lost my wallet. If you give me $20 to fill my tank, I\u2019ll send it back\u2026 \u2026with interest!\u201d  Some even had convincing business cards. One time, a guy gave me a business card saying he was a VP at a bank. I said I was going to call the bank to make sure he was legit. He ran out. It\u2019s really jaded me. I\u2019ll donate to shelters and stuff, but I\u2019ll never give a beggar anything. I always feel like I\u2019m getting scammed.",

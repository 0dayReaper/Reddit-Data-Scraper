    "postText": "I was told to post this here from AITA. \n\nBackground: My boyfriend (E) and I have been together for four years. Whenever I would come over when we were dating, his apartment was messy but it was blamed on his roommates. I\u2019m very cognizant that I am particular in cleaning, so I thought it just wasn\u2019t clean enough to /my standards\u2019/. I moved in with him ~3 years ago and adopted two dogs together. \n\nI quickly realized we do not have the same view of what \u201cclean\u201d is. We have communicated about it and he has made a lot of progress. But, he consistently does one thing: stuffs his colored striped socks into the couch. I have told him that I have had to chase the dogs around because they find them in the couch. He thought it was funny.\n\nOver the last few weeks, I have bought multiple cloth dog toys resembling his socks and have trained my dogs to play tug of war with them. They will now dive for them whenever he\u2019s laying on the couch and places them on the ground to \u201cpick up later.\u201d I also do not stop them from playing with the socks anymore.\n\nHe came home yesterday and found his favorite pair of his socks decimated all over the living room and was furious that I didn\u2019t stop them. I told him they were the socks he stuffed in the couch yesterday and he should have put them in the hamper. He stormed off to his office and is not talking to me. AITA?\n\nEdit: my dogs do not ingest the socks, they use it as a tug of war object. Using this example, when the pair individually ripped in half, they were no longer interested in it.",

I'm responding to this statement here:\n\n&gt;Cleaning up after yourself in a shared space isn't something that should require communication and 'progress' as an adult\n\n\nI take issue with this because there are plenty of adults out there actually making effort and progressing. \n\n\n--\n\nNot everyone grew up with healthy habits. Some adults are absolutely progressing on that type of chore because they may not have learned good habits when they were learning to function but they're learning now so they can care for themselves and others.\n\n\nFor example: I was raised by hoarders. Almost nothing got thrown away because it *might* be useful eventually and there was just shit everywhere because my mom rarely left her room. She didn't clean and the most she did to teach us was to yell about what failures we were when she got tired of the mess she never cleaned. On top of that, most of her children have adhd including me and rather than get us care and teach us how to function around it, she claimed it was made up and that we were just incompetent at everything. Yes, I'm bad at not throwing shit on the floor. I don't need to be told that it's not ok. I'm aware. That's precisely *why* I'm actively progressing as an adult. I can't change my past but goddammit I can fucking change my future.\n\n\nYour holier than thou talking points here are all too telling about how many resources you had through your formative years. Some of us didn't get anything and just got thrown into the world to drown. Consider yourself lucky and stop shaming people who got less parenting than you did. That's not how you'd want to be treated, is it?",

I come home, take off my shoes at the door, put on slippers, take off my jacket and hat, hang them, head to my bedroom, change into shorts/sleep pants, and then go about whatever I'm going to do inside the house. If I'm heading out, it's the opposite, but pretty similar routine.\n\nLike someone else said, and I'm not proud, I'm a cluttered person. My kitchen counter when I'm cooking, my coffee table, and various other stuff takes me a bit to clean off but still. Walking in and putting my shoes furniture or sitting around in uncomfortable or sweaty clothes is just bad for you and your furniture and it's just so easy to just start a routine like that. Unless I'm folding laundry while watching tv, you're not going to see anything but my hat, jacket and shoes near the front door anywhere in my living room. If even I can manage that, dude, I can't imagine who someone couldn't (aside from disabilities, maybe).\n\nEdit 2 days later: its been literally years but I just committed a cardinal sin. I was rushing out the door to shop and realized I had a hole in a sock from a \"playful\" kitten so I grabbed a new pair, sat down, changed and when I got back I found the offending sock with a hole in it sitting in my recliner. I threw it away quick-like but I remembered this comment and needed to either admit my sin or, idk, tuck the sock under my pillow to repent? It's been years, but sometimes people slip.",

The older people get, the better they get at being stuck in behaviors and making up reasons why it is a good thing. The only difference is if they are open to \"better\" ways because their own dont work, or because they actually want new input. To try to teach someone that dont want to change or learn is the most frustrating thing in the whole world.",

Certainly some things are worth asking for change while others it's nice to just help out instead. The degree of which that makes sense for your relationship is something you may already have considered, but I felt like leaving this advice because sometimes things we feel are obvious are not always obvious to everyone.

My labs have no interest in destroying anything except their toys but my husky LOVES to destroy everything and anything, if given the opportunity. I tell all guests not to leave anything laying around. I have her trained to not chew on our stuff, but anything new/different seems to be fair game. I figure, if you\u2019re warned and don\u2019t take appropriate action to make sure your stuff isn\u2019t destroyed, that\u2019s your own fault. In your situation, he left his stuff laying around, he pays the consequences. Maybe he\u2019ll learn his lesson.",

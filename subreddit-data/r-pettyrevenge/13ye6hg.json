    "postText": "I work with a woman, a very attractive woman, who gets hit on all the time. She may look cute and beautiful, but this woman is anything but a pushover. Her experiences dealing with disrespectful men have allowed her to hone her retorts to a nuclear level at times. \n\nOne of our employees, an older lecherous man, (who had made sexist comments to her in the past) once said to her, \"How's your day going Doll?\". She shot back, \"Not too bad...Action Figure.\" It went right over his head (even though others nearby understood the reference and were laughing) and he said something about being glad to hear that. \"A Stupid Action Figure\" was her response to him. She then shortened it to Stupid AF, which could have other meanings, but in the context of her dialog, was perfectly acceptable. \n\nAnd he became known as Stupid AF among the other employees when they would talk about him. \n\nNote: She referenced the controversy about calling the GI Joe Doll an Action Figure so that boys wouldn't have to say they played with dolls.",

On one management t-con she patted herself on the back for something we created that she had no idea how it worked or why so I told her, \"You should get the Mrs. Management award of the year for that one.\"\n\nShe reminded me, \"I'm divorced now, I'm a Miss.\"\n\nSo I conceded her point, \"Sorry, you should get a Miss Management award.\"\n\nMy coworkers muted themselves to hide their laughter as they messaged me.  My boss never did catch on.",

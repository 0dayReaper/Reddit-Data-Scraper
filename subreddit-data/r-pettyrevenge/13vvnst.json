    "postText": "I am going to try and keep this brief.\nI work in a factory in Belgium that processes raw food materials. Because these products are in powder form, we have a serious risk of dust explosions. So operators are not alowed to charge their (non explosive safe) phones in the production hall. \nThey keep doing it anyway.\nI told them, stop doing it, it an explosion risk\nThey keep doing it\nSo I started disconnecting the power outlets.\n(We don't use them, only for technical usage. Oh and I work in the technical department so I'm not a random dude disconnecting power outlets xD)\nThey call me and say: hey dude, the outlets aren't working.\nAnd here comes my petty revenge.\nI get to say: You don't need them for you're day to day job. What were you using them for? But I'll make a work order to reconnect them and I'll make sure to mention to the supervisor why you need them.\nI know it's petty but I was fed up and it's a damn safety issue.",

The automatic dust clearing system had been out of order for ages and no one was doing it manually, so the whole place was coated in fuel for the fires that made everything go boom.",

    "postText": "My aunt was famous for her flan (a sort of Spanish cr\u00e8me caramel), and my mom kept asking for the recipe. Finally, in the 1990s my aunt gave my mom the recipe because my mom was tasked with dessert for Christmas that year. But my aunt altered the ingredients. The thing is, the change made for a tastier, eggier, smoother custard than the original recipe. It was\u2014and still is\u2014amazing. My aunt asked my mom for the recipe because she couldn\u2019t remember the proportions she had invented, and my mom has never given her the recipe.\n\nEveryone prefers my mom\u2019s flan now.\n\nETA, a bunch of people have asked for the recipe so here it is.\n\nFlan recipe\n\n1/2 cup sugar\n\nA heat resistant mold for the flan, lidded if possible\n\n1 can of sweetened condensed milk\nThe same amount of whole milk\n\n2 Mexican cinnamon sticks (Ceylon cinnamon)\n1 clove, lightly crushed\n1 teaspoon good vanilla extract\nOptional: Rind of 1/4 orange (only the rind, not the pith). You can replace with lemon if you like.\nOptional: a few drops of orange blossom water\n\n1 large egg\n4 egg yolks\n\nStep 1: In a small sauce pan, heat the sugar over medium high heat, stirring often, until it melts and caramelizes. You want it to have a deep amber colour. Remove from heat and pour into the bottom of the mold(s), coating evenly with a thin layer of caramel. Allow to cool.\n\nCaution: this is incredibly hot and will produce third degree burns if it touches your skin, and will turn bitter quickly, so work fast.\n\nStep 2: In a small sauce pan, heat both milks with the cinnamon sticks, cloves, orange rind. Move constantly scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon, to avoid scorching the milk. When it begins to rise from boiling, lower the heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from heat, add the vanilla and orange blossom water, and allow to cool.\n\nStep 3: once cooled to room temperature, strain the mixture through a fine strainer, and mix in the blender with the egg and egg yolks.\n\nStep 4: pour this mixture into your mold. Cover it with its lid if you have one, or make a lid with aluminum foil if not. Leave one centimetre (a little less than 1/2 inch) of headspace between the liquid and the rim of your mold.\n\nStep 5: put the mold in a pressure cooker with enough water to cover the bottom of the mold by two cm. and turn on. Use the kow-pressure setting if your cooker is modern. I use the egg mode, which is useless for eggs but useful for this. As soon as the cooker is under pressure, cook for 10 minutes.\n\nStep 6: Turn off the cooker and cool the lid with cold dishcloths to release pressure quickly. Open as soon as it\u2019s safe for you to do so. Cool to room temperature.\n\nStep 7: Refrigerate overnight.\n\nStep 8: to unmold, place a deep dish on too (to collect the caramel sauce) and very quickly turn over, with a firm shake. It is helpful to watch some tutorials on how to do this. The flan should release and fall into the deep dish, with the caramel sauce pooling around it. Serve immediately.\n\nSometimes the flan breaks, so practice!",

Soo I saved it for another day.\n\n\nFlan would be differently pronounced here and would mean, well... Moron. Local slang, though... So I can't give this to my childhood friends, as they'd do dad jokes about this all evening. Unexpected problems, huh? If I DO give this to them, I'll tell them its Flexi. OP-inspired. With my luck, one or more of them are here.\n\n\n\"naaah, it's not what it's actually called, right? Riiight?!\" and I'll have to endure their bad jokes all evening. Well, thanks again, OP!",

My mom once asked for the recipe at Christmas. My aunt gave her a recipe, but my mom knew from just looking at the ingredients that the recipe wasn\u2019t right. And it was a fake recipe. \n\nSo my mom spent the next year creating and perfecting a chocolate truffle tart recipe. Then took it to Christmas and everyone liked my mom\u2019s better.",

Spread chocolate frosting over peanut butter. \n\nChocolate frosting\n\n1/2 cup butter\n1/4 cup cocoa\n1/3 cup buttermilk\n1lb confectioners sugar, sifted\n1 t vanilla.\n\nIn a saucepan, combine butter, cocoa and buttermilk.  Boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.  Pour over sugar in a bowl, stirring until smooth.  Stir in vanilla.  \n\nMy mother in law found this recipe in a magazine and made it for a coworker's birthday.  Everyone went nuts for it so she made it again when we took a trip to visit.  She was so pleased when we loved it too and asked her for the recipe.  It's a heavy dessert, but if you have a tall glass of milk and don't want to be able to button your pants, this is just the thing \ud83d\ude06",

Make sure there's about half an inch of space between your top pot and your boil pot.\n\n-Dump swt. cnd. milk into top pot. Scrape as much as possible out of the can.\n\n-Sift cocoa powder into top pot and mix until well-blended. (It should look like a really sticky hot fudge.)\n\n-Allow to heat until the mixture starts to form small bubbles, then start whisking, slowly and continually, until you can run your whisk through and leave a trail that takes a few seconds to fill in. (If you'd like to use a candy thermometer for exact results, 180f-190f is the best range.)\n\n-Remove top pot from heat and mix in butter until melted.\n\n-Pour mixture into greased bowl and chill for 2-4 hours.\n\n-While mixture is cooling, set up a plate to make coating the brigadieros easier, and some mini nuffin cups for the finished products if you want to be fancy.\n\n-Once mixture has cooled, grease your hands (or the candy scoop) with butter, take about a tablespoon glop of the chilled concoction, and roll it into a ball.\n\n-Drop the ball into the toppings, roll until fully coated, pop it in a muffin cup, and viola! Delicious, addictive, fudgey devils.\n\nYou can use any topping you want. Traditionally, it's chocolate sprinkles, but I usually make them with crushed pecans for me and my family.\n\nIf you want to freeze them, don't coat them until you're ready to eat them and thaw them in the fridge.\n\nThis recipe also comes with the enticing option to skip the \"turning it into little balls\" step and just eat the chilled mixture straight from the bowl. Tastes just as good, though my thighs typically don't thank me for the lack of portion control.\n\nBut my favorite part? If you don't like chocolate, it is *so easy* to swap to another flavor. The basic ingredients always come down to:\n\n-1 can of sweetened condensed milk\n\n-3 tbsp. flavor\n\n-1 tbsp. butter\n\nI've made coffee, lemon, strawberry, mango, guava, kiwi, papaya, almond, cinnamon, taro, and matcha flavored ones and they've all came out amazing.\n\nEdited because I forgot to put in when to add the butter. \ud83d\ude2c",

He was forever asking me to make these cookies, telling everyone they were the best cookies, etc. He also repeatedly asked for the recipe, but I wouldn't give it to him. The thing about J was that he thought he was the world's best cook. He bragged nonstop about his spaghetti and meatballs, for example. He spent all day making his special sauce, and had special techniques for making the meatballs, etc. And yes, they were good. But he'd boast so much about his cooking that other people thought he did all the cooking, when in reality he only cooked on occasion, and my sister was the main cook. She was (and is) a really good cook, but even 25 years after she left J, our mom still thinks that my sister doesn't cook. Also, if someone gave J their special family recipe for whatever, he would immediately tweak it, and then every time he made it he would boast about how much better his version was. It wasn't other people who were saying that his version was better, it was J himself. I would not give J the cookie recipe because I knew he would alter it and boast about his superior cookies. The funniest part to me was that the cookies were just Russian teacakes (also known as sandies), with a recipe that's widely available. My sister and I learned to make these cookies as kids, from our mom. My sister could have given J the recipe, or just told him where to look to find it, but she never did.",

Back when I was younger I used to cook on the weekends for a houseful of priests.  One Saturday I was making flan for them that I planned to serve for Sunday's dessert and, while coating the ramekins in the caramelized sugar, I moved wrong and poured it over my hand.  I could actually hear the skin sizzle as I sprinted to the sink to run cold water over the burn, and it took *weeks* to heal.\n\nThe recipe sounds fabulous.  At some point I'm going to make it for myself.",

But if we\u2019re getting technical, French flan is baked in a crust, and Spanish flan is baked in a Bain Marie with a caramel base that makes the sauce.",

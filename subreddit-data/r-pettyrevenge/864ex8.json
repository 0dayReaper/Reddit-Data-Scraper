    "postText": "This happened a couple years ago. It had snowed a bunch and so I went out to clear a spot for my boyfriend at the time for when he got home from work (police officer). I spent a while digging it out, and as I was finishing up some girl drove up and parked in it (**while I was still shoveling it**!). I told her that I just dug it out intending to use it and asked her to move, and she didn't. She then got out of her car and walked away... Turns out she lived two buildings down so she normally wouldn't park there anyways!\n\n Our complex had a mini snow plow and the dude was plowing in the area and saw this all go down. He helped me move all the snow from the pile he just created and put it all around her car. We buried it up to the door handles on all sides. He then dug out a new spot for me. \n\nSaw her later trying to dig out her car, turns out she didn't have a shovel. So, naturally, bc I'm petty I went out and reshovelled the sidewalk from the lot up to our building, and threw all of the snow on her vehicle while I did it. Then went inside and took my shovel with me.\n\nEdit: emphasis added for people who don't get why I was so petty\n\nEdit 2: thanks for the gold!\n\nEdit 3: answers to questions for clarification. I only mentioned bf was a cop to justify why he was at work during all the snow, which was why I was digging him out a spot.  Also, the spot was between two other cars so she couldn't even walk along the side of her car to get to the door, which also meant that it didn't take much snow to bury her car in.",

I woke up late and had like 15 minutes to get to my college class, but my windshield was completely iced over, no possible way I could\u2019ve scraped or defrosted in time (the class took off points if you missed it or were late). So I ran inside and grabbed the coffee pot and dumped it on my windshield.  Miraculously, it didn\u2019t break, and melted enough ice off so that I could see to drive and wasn\u2019t late.   However, after I poured it I set the pot down on the front of my car, where it immediately slid off and shattered everywhere.  Cleaned it up after I got home and explained to my parents what happened, and only then was I made aware that pouring hot liquid on my frozen windshield is a really bad idea.  They were like, \u0ca0_\u0ca0      I had no idea that was even a thing.   ",

That is, pre-1989 PYREX can be weaker if scuffed up, chipped, or scratched. \n\nAfter 1989, Corning sold the Pyrex brand to World Kitchen, and pyrex (all lower case) is now made from soda lime glass. Pre-1989 it was borosilicate, the same stuff used in lab glass for beakers and such. I went down the Internet rabbit hole on that one after I watched an Anchor Hocking baking dish explode while being taken  out of an oven. The exploding glass and contents of the dish broke the glass on the inside of the oven door. So, I guess, on the upside, it didn't break the glass on your oven door. Still sucks nonetheless. ",

    "postText": "Not to give too much info away, I was hired at an organization as a job title of basically \"helper\". Well for someone who is supposed to just be helping, I had a ridiculous amount of work. \n\nAlmost all of my coworkers were huge technologically illiterate boomers. So I actually sort of thrived this as a very useful person. For example, one guy would spend half his day copying items and passing them into another program we use. HE DIDN'T EVEN USE CTRL C CTRL V he would right click then copy then go into the files menu or something and \"insert copied item from clipboard\". He was so proud of himself when he showed me because \"don't worry you won't have to retype everything!\"\n\nI wrote a program to do this automatically but did not tell him. So I would just run it occasionally as part of my responsibilities. \n\nAnyway, I did a lot of stuff like this, I'd estimate i saved about 15 hours of work every day, on top of the 8.5 hours I did too! but then insert sergeant fuck face.  (This wasn't the military but I just like to call him that.)\n\n\nWe are having a team meeting when he shows up. White hair combed okayish, a scrunched face, glasses. He just sort of just showed up one day and took notes during our morning meeting. \n\nAt one point someone brought up a name of one of our customers. I said, oh is that the 300 lb guy with a big beard? Sort of as a joke because I mostly do back end stuff. There was a guy like this I recently did some entrance stuff for. But I was wrong and my boss said no it's blah blah some other person.. okay.  Then we talked about that person a bit. \n\nFast forward about a week and this Sgt ff is a complete fucking douchebag to me. I don't know why, he will ignore me during group conversations and literally sometimes scoff at me.  Who actually scoffs at people??\n\nI was having a really rough week looking for some extremely important files.  People were yelling all day.  I was exasperated. Too much to do,  I was having anxiety attacks at home in the middle of the night.  But it was Friday so I was pulling through. \n\nAs i looked for this file I ended up deep on our file structure and the search returned a personal folder structure within one of the drives. I clicked out of curiosity and there it was \"Sgt ff's notes\".\n\nI opened it and there was a whole section about me. This guy basically goes from location to location getting people fired to save the CEOs money. \n\nAnd he was working on me now.  I scrolled through his notes and at the very top I saw\n\n\"Frosty thought a 4'10 24 year old female patient was a 300 lb bearded man.  Clearly atrocious attention to detail\"\n\nThat's just ONE example of how completely fucked up his comments were. \n\n\nSo, in combination with my job (which I generally liked and enjoyed helping people) knowing I wasn't getting paid enough for my effort. This horrible week I had.  And Sgt fuck faces comments, I said fuck this. \n\nI set up 3 email configurations. \n1. To my boss letting him know I will be taking 2 weeks of vacation time. To be sent at 10pm tonight. \n2. To the company letting them know I will not be present for 2 weeks so whatever work they currently need me to do they will need to do themselves. To be sent Monday morning at 4 AM.\n3. For any emails that came in, I set an auto response that said \"I will be out for an unknown amount of time, for any routine, emergency, or even occasional items, it is imperative you reach out to Sgt Fuck Face at xxxxx for assistance\"\n\n\nThen? I turned off every automated task I had ever set up. \n\n\nThen I swung by ff's temporary office and said \"I think I found a way to make your job easier!\" He didn't even really turn his head to look at me but just raised one eyebrow.  Then I left. \n\n\nI actually got multiple calls on Monday morning I didn't answer. It didn't last long apparently.  But I stayed strong and didn't respond to anything. \n\n\nOn Wednesday I had a little anxiety about it but I stayed as strong as i could. I thought about the tasks that needed a 2 day turnaround... there's no way some of the guys were keeping up with their normal duties. Guaranteed at least 2 people were no longer doing their normal jobs just to keep up with my automated tasks. \n\n\nI got a long email to my personal account (I guess from my resume or when I interviewed) from my boss on Thursday night of the first week!\n\nIt went something like this:\n\n\"Frosty, I know you're a smart person and probably figured out what the company had us doing. I would say it's very important you call me but that probably isn't going to work I see. \n\nI've talked with sgt ff's boss, and he will be leaving our location. I explained our progress meetings seemed to be going in the wrong direction and that you are one of our most valuable employees here. \n\nI am sure you are probably looking at other jobs at this point, or maybe you have even started one. I hope not.  If you could please reach back to me I would like to offer you a raise. It has become very apparent how useful you are around here. I hear about it every day, believe me.\"\n\nSo I came back on Monday with a 10,000 dollar raise and Sgt fuck face out of my face. My boss apologized again in person and said he didn't get a say in it. I think it's a little weird he could have a say after I left, but not before... but I sort of get it.\n\nEdit: Hopefully this is a better edit than most /r/awardspeechedits but I just want to unrelatedly say that while the world seems to be going to shit, every single one of us can start making a difference in it. Please just try to bicycle or walk to work once a week, or skip one meat-based meal every so often. Try out composting. Or swap your dairy milk with almond/oat/coconut/etc/etc/etc milk. It's easy to blame everyone else or industry and carry on like you can't make a difference. But you really can. All of us can. And if everyone starts to live more sustainably, the markets MUST switch and follow US, the people,  the workers. That's the way it works and that's how we get more bicycle lanes and a more sustainable earth where our friends and family can prosper.",

Company was a mess, we spent a month documenting some of the most egregious cases of idiocy - not actually the fault of the people but their processes were a joke and management had outright refused any internal efforts to change. \n\nSite manager lost his shit half way through, telling that if we had a shred of evidence he would fire the lot on the spot. Had to very subtley 'lose' several stacks of reports, pulled an 'our bad, we fucked up' in the meeting...\n\nThe meeting later in the day with the CEO and site manager was somewhat more satisfying. He didn't lose his job, but was absolutely read the riot act. The rest of that job was great. Client crew knew we could have thrown them under the bus, but took the harder route.",

To which he countered, \n\n\"We could just give them an email list with who does what in each region.\"\n\nHaving also anticipated this, I handed him examples of the various email responses I got from different employees in those regions... chock full of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes and profanity (these were mechanics, roughnecks and various other blue collar people).\n\n\"Oh...\", he said, \"I see.

Farming is preemptively checking in on problem areas, resolving issues while minor, spending time seeking problems to preempt, root causing and removing issues, and committing all resources to running full tilt rather than retaining resources for problem solving. \n\nFirefighting is more tackling issues such that a day can progress as normal, with a heavier focus on hitting a metric today, and dealing with tomorrow tomorrow. This could mean retaining labor to to react to issues, waiting for problems to arise, favoring short term solutions over long term, favoring low cost solutions over full resolutions etc.\n\nNow, to be honest, a world without firefighters would burn. This is just an industry term asking the company to become a world without fire.",

When I started on the project I was specifically told I was only allowed to communicate to 2 people on the client's side. Even had an email stating this. \n\nMy job was to review automated processes as they completed, and determine what cause failures. I would then send the results to these 2 people for them to follow up. Pretty easy stuff really.\n\nFast forward a month and I'm called into a meeting with the director of our location (also a Sergeant FF) . He says the client is pissed because they see me log in, but then nothing. They think I'm sitting on my thumb and doing nothing. I tell him about the explicitly stated instructions. I show him my sent mail folder showing my communication history. Fucker still puts me on a PIP.\n\nEnd of the next week I'm in a conference call with EIGHT vice presidents. They're telling me the same shit. Clint is pissed and about to cancel contract. I can tell they're getting ready to fire me. They're not even talking TO me.\n\nI interrupt and ask if I can share my screen. I show them the same shit I showed my SGT FF. Suddenly their entire demeanor changes. One VP asks me to forward every email to his inbox.\n\nI don't hear anything on my side for a month. However client side I get updated instructions of who to email my analysis results to. One of the 2 people I find out was escorted from the building. The other is suddenly very nice to me.\n\nTurns out the fired guy was against having staff augmentation from consulting firms, and wanted to make us look bad so he could hire a buddy.\n\nA month later I'm called into director FF's office to review the PIP (yeah he never recinded it). He says I have made remarkable improvement, and asks what I've done that's made the client so happy. I told him \"Nothing. Doing the same exact thing, but communicating with new people client side.\" Still had to sign off on the fucking PIP.",

I was a store manager for Starbucks for years and our DM's literally controlled everything from what were allowed to offer for raises to if we even are allowed to give our partners raises to if we're allowed to hire or not. Of course some DM's would give more control to the store managers as they're the ones who are working the stores everyday and see the day to day operations, however my store wasn't one of them. My stores district manager would actually come into my store whenever I wasn't there and tell my team how poorly they're doing and then the next day I'd have notes or if I saw the previous day's crew they'd tell me about it, sometimes in tears. I tried going to hr, to the DM's boss, to other DM's. Its not that they weren't doing their jobs properly either or that we were performing poorly, my store was actually exceeding all of our goals every month and performing better than all of her other stores, our customer reviews and satisfaction surveys were better than her other stores, yet according to her we aren't good enough. In the end I had a turn over rate of about 70% for my last three months. After I left (because of her), within about 2 months all 22 of my team that had been there either transferred out of her district or quit if they weren't permitted to transfer and turnover jumped to over 100%. I actually had someone quit before she started as our dm because one of my team had worked under her before and didn't want to go through that bullshit again.",

We interviewed both internal and external candidates. The only problem was we wanted to hire 3 people who were bank tellers. They did a great job on the interview. \n\nThe problem was HR wouldn't let us hire them. They said it would be too much of an increase. They had a rule that the maximum raise at any one time couldn't be more than 15%. And they paid the tellers so little that the lowest salary for the new role was higher than that. We went up to our site manager and still got told there's nothing anyone could do. Hire someone else. \n\nSo instead we hired someone straight out of college that was making minimum wage in fast food, but since they didn't already work for the company that's fine somehow. We also hired at least two people who we didn't really want to... And they both were gone within the first month.",

If you don't say anything and nothing breaks, 'here's some more work'.\n\nNow I still do more than those around me, but now I know when to say enough.  I'll straight up tell someone I can't do it or give it to someone else, or it'll have to wait.\n\nI've also learned to automate tons of work.

It fluctuates quite a lot. \n\nRecently we've started going into the office more (not mandatory, but encouraged to go once per week for \"Community Days\"); soon it will be mandatory three days per week.

We measured things, to make sure the items or equipment were in spec.  In this one lab I was assigned towards the end of my time there, I worked alone and got there early.  \n\nMy supervisor came in early one morning (before 6am) and saw me sitting at my desk having breakfast and reading the paper.  He asked what I was doing.  I showed him and said, \u201cI was told my start time could be no earlier than 6 am, but I\u2019ve already turned on all the equipment to warm up.\u201d  A 30 minute warm up was required.  \n\nHe came back around 615, coffee in hand, and asked what I was doing.  I told him, \u201cThe equipment\u2019s warmed up.  I took readings [here] and set that system for the next test point.  That\u2019ll take 3 hours to stabilize.  I\u2019m in the middle of an electrical test on this unit and have the next unit plugged in and warming up  When I\u2019m done with this test, I\u2019ll take readings on those 10 items in the oil bath, pull them to drain, and run the calculations.  By the time that\u2019s done, I can put them in the next oil bath to stabilize for 20 minutes and the next electrical test will be ready to go.  In the meantime, I have some items in the ice bath I\u2019ll get readings for.\u201d  \n\nHe left me alone after that.  He *did* ask why I didn\u2019t make the coffee in the morning.  I told him I don\u2019t drink coffee, had never used a coffee maker, and had no reason to learn.  The guys he was used to working with?  They wouldn\u2019t even plug in anything to warm up until start time.  That let them have a half-hour to sit and talk *on the clock* every day.",

They are the people who keep everything from falling apart.\n\nSome years ago I used to work at an NGO.\n The upper management, old folks who quite literally had never set foot on site for the entire year I was there, decided to do some restructuring. Part of this was hire to a supervisor to check up on us (read assert dominance over everyone) and that the really hard working woman whose job was to answer the phone and manage all the patients was no longer necessary and was unceremoniously fired.\n\nWe tried to convey the message that without her we wouldn't be able to do our job as she managed every single detail about everything and was actually just as important to the NGO daily functions as us (the \"professional/specialized\" staff), but the new supervisor assured us that he would handle things from now on. \n\nThe following week had a steep drop in patients scheduled (literally over 90% less). After a month of basically no activity we were told that the NGO was shutting down functions temporarily. Good job, board of crusty old guys, you contributed into shutting down access to cheap services for people who really needed them and couldn't afford them anywhere else. Good fucking job.",

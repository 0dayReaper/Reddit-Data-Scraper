    "postText": "I was babysitting and took my young charges to the beach. They were 3 years old and having a great time collecting sticks and rocks and feathers, playing chase, digging and having kid fun.\n\nThere were very few people nearby, just a couple of young gals, maybe early 20s snoozing and tanning, on a sunny day, sparkly ocean, an all around nice time. They were 100% unbothered by the two lil kids with me doing their thing.\n\nA woman and maybe her daughter of an age similar to the tanning gals came and plopped down on their blanket maybe 15 feet away from the tanning gals, probably 30 feet from us. Older woman pulls out a bag of something, bread? crackers? and starts chucking them out into the sand between her and the two gals. Immediately a flurry of dirty, squawking, fighting gulls descend for the snacks, swooping over the two gals, waking them up. They are startled and annoyed by the low circling, landing, cracker snatching birds  that are blowing sand on them with their flapping wings, just inches away.\n\nI hear one of the gals ask the woman to please not feed the birds because they are disturbing them. The woman starts shrieking that she can do what she wants, blah blah. Never mind that she could have done her Snow White convenes with nature scene somewhere else on the wide open beach if she'd considerately sat some distance from other people, but she didn't. \n\nI was thinking how annoying she was as she went on &amp; on at the two gals, but suddenly my young charges did what many three year olds love to do at the beach...they got up and ran straight at the birds who all started flapping and flying in all directions to escape, giving the bird lady a taste of the nastiness the gals had just experienced. If they landed nearby again, the kids turned and ran that way. Seagulls everywhere! Bird mayhem!\n\nThe bird lady was enraged and started yelling at the kids to leave the birds alone. I yelled at her that they are just little kids and THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT. The kids had stopped when she started yelling but I told them to run and chase birds if they wanted, so they did.\n\nYounger woman looked like she wanted to dig a hole and climb in. Obnoxious woman packed up her crackers and blanket and they left.\n\nThe sun continued to shine, the water sparkled and we kept on enjoying our lovely day.",

(We grew tired of being pooped upon.) There is a silver lining. If someone starts to share their snacks we prepare to be entertained. People who start sharing their snacks don\u2019t realize they\u2019re about to feel like they\u2019re in an Alfred Hitchcock movie.",

Maybe 3 feet behind us?\n\nThe kid (4 or 5 yr old) immediately starts throwing crackers even though signs are up and down the beach telling them not to feed the seagulls.\n\nSeveral groups of folks asked them to stop because it's super annoying and you can't even pull out your own snack to eat because they get bold when there is a bunch of them.\n\nI asked the kid to stop twice and then asked his mother to stop three times and honestly..I have a mean face..she had to have seen I was mad.\n\nThe kid threw another fucking cracker right behind me..I was shaking I was so mad.   I told the kids to either cover their heads or go put their feet in the water... turned around and screamed if they want fucking birds..I'll give them birds.. and dumped a party size bag of doritos ALL over their beach blanket .. the birds went WILD!  The kid was screaming hysterically..the mom was yelling (dad didn't say a damn thing \ud83d\ude02) and the birds were having the meal of their life.   As soon as the birds calmed down, she called me a bitch and the packed up while the kid screamed the whole time.    My nephew (a smart mouthed teenager) said \"well...everyone asked you not to feed the birds.  We just did it better.\"\n\nThen I saw an old teacher \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  she recognized my sister and I... I was soooo embarrassed.  Like mortified.   A year later..I'm no longer ashamed lol.",

Gulls would coast alongside the upper deck and some genius thought it would be fun to hold up a chip or something for the gull to snatch. As a 6yo I thought this was the coolest, so I wanted to try it. I remember I was eating Fritos, so I went to the rail and held one up. A gull came swooping down, snatched the chip, but also bit my thumb and drew blood. Cue the crying. My father, who watched the whole thing, immediately took my mother's mostly smoked cigarette and held it up until the same gull that bit me came by. The bird grabbed the lit cigarette, ate it, and then did a power dive into the water. It popped up to the surface and just sat there looking indignant. I know now as an adult that that was a shitty thing to do, but 6yo me thought it was justice.",

The waitstaff had to take a broom or something to fend off the seagulls when carrying out the food. OH even asked to the managers to let him sit on the roof &amp; snipe the gulls with cayenne pepper spiked paintballs. The managers never allowed it though, lol.\n\nI used to go to that waterfront often when I was a kid, &amp; over the years sometimes the patios had to be closed off entirely because the gulls were too used to snatching food right from customers' plates while they were eating. Ngl, it was a little eerie to see a flock of of 50+ gulls all sitting on the patio tables &amp; staring into the restaurant.\n\n\nFunny story:\nA few years ago I went to the beach, &amp; there were some (I guess) 18-19 year old boys hanging out &amp; horsing around nearby, just being teenagers with freedom. When they were wrapping the day up, they had a couple of huge bags of Cheetos leftover. One guy laid out on the sand &amp; had his friends dump the Cheetos out all over him. \n\nIt went exactly as can be expected.\n\nChaotic flapping of wings, flailing of arms, alarmed hollering &amp; yelping, &amp; feathers flying ensued. After a few minutes of a Hitchcock-esque moment the guy who played snack platter gave up &amp; rinsed off in the water, his friends were filming &amp; about rolling on the sand with laughter.\n\nI got to witness something that would befit a Jackass skit. \ud83e\udd23 I was laughing so hard my guts hurt &amp; my eyes were streaming. I tried to get my own pics, but my old phone camera was a piece of junk. I still laugh when I remember those guys &amp; their \"brilliant\" plan. \ud83d\ude06",

Her granddad had buried her in the sand, basically her just laying on her back with sand piled over her body but her head free. Her granddad rested on a towel beside her afterward and they both ended up falling asleep for a little bit. During their snooze her little brother crunched up a bag of crisps, (chips), and tipped them around her head. You can imagine the hellscape she woke up to when the skyrats descended. \n\nOn a happier note, mum trained me since I was steady enough to toddle to chase birds away from her, and that was my job on any outing/holiday. I was chasing away pigeons, gulls, ducks, anything that wasn\u2019t in a cage/enclosure and within 15-20 feet of her. I have plenty of very fun memories, haha!",

Most outdoor restaurants have settled on a workable solution: they string a network of clear monofilament fishing line above the dining area, running at random angles and fairly close together. The gulls don\u2019t see the lines as they swoop down for a snack and they collide with them. It doesn\u2019t seriously hurt the gulls, but they don\u2019t like it and quickly learn to stay away. Pity you can\u2019t do that at the beach.",

We were on some lake on boat, swimming past an island. It was a perfect place where we were - really shallow water where we got out of boat and walked. I was splashing around. And then we learned why such perfect place was deserted - island was nestling ground for gulls. They saw us and attacked. I think, we got out without blood, but on our way back we made sure to pass this island on good distance.",

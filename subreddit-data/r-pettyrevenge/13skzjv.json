    "postText": "1st time posting on this site, just thought of an old memory and wanted to share.  tl:dr at the bottom.\n\nSo, this was many years ago, back in the late 1990's.  I worked as an electrical engineer for one of the largest construction equipment manufacturing companies globally.  I had been with this company for a few years, however was new to this particular engineering department.  \n\nI got along with everyone fine and ended becoming good friends with one of the senior engineers, I'll refer to as C.  C was fun to be around, easy going, loved joking around and playing office pranks on unsuspecting people.  He also had an unique ability to fart on command.  He would walk by someone and just let a long one rip.\n\n I too love dishing out the pranks and can also take the pranks.  C and I had a gentlemen's agreement; don't fart on me and I won't prank you.  This worked well for a couple years, then one day, he blasts me with a loud, wet and smelly fart while I was reviewing a design.  I turned my head to C and said, \"Ok, it's on.\"\n\nA couple weeks later, I hatched my plan.  As C was a \"Hunt &amp; Peck\" typer, meaning he had to look at the keys and would click each one, one at a time, with his two index fingers. He didn't notice that I had switched his M &amp; N keys; also coincidentally, this was late in the year and his password included the word \"November\" which had the N and the M key in it.\n\nAfter switching his keys, I went off to lunch and forgot about the prank.  I return from lunch and see C with two other people at his desk and a help desk operator on his speaker phone at the same time.  I didn't realize at the time, they were all four trying to figure out why his password wasn't working.\n\nFifteen or so minutes later, I here C yell, apparently he figured out his N and M keys had been switched and was now very embarrassed to have to explain to the three people helping him, that the error was on his end, with the keyboard issue.  He was so upset, he went home for the day.\n\nIt took a while, but C eventually calmed down and we got on well as friends, but he learned, never fart on me again.\n\ntl:dr  Fart on me, and I'll make it so you cannot log into your own computer.  Moral of the story, don't fart on me!",

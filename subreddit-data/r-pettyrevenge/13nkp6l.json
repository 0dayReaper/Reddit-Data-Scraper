    "postText": "My child\u2019s daycare had a death in the family. It\u2019s a small, family owned place, so this affected all the employees. They sent out an email at like 3am. \n\nI couldn\u2019t miss work, as I had a very important day, so I scrambled to find a sitter, just for that day. \n\nMy step brothers girlfriend was basically the only person I know that doesn\u2019t work so I called her. \n\nShe says \u201csure, but I can only watch him for 6 hours, and I\u2019ll give you my family rate so it will only be $200.\u201d\n\nI asked if she was serious.\n\nShe assured me she was, and that this was her livelihood and she takes it VERY seriously\u2026 that she was already offering me a FAMILY discount.\n\nPlease note that it was not her livelihood. My step brother has a great job and has always paid for everything. He has tried to get her to do anything to earn money but she refuses to work and believes he should support her fully, including daily Starbucks, hair, nails, designer stuff, etc. \n\nPlease also note that I had done A LOT for this girl, just to help her out. The list is long. \n\nI agreed, only because I would have lost my job had I not gone to work that day. I paid her $200, which she demanded up front, to get to work for a little over 4 hours after factoring commute. \n\nFast forward a couple of years\u2026 they have separated, they have a kid and she is living for free in his dads extra house, and driving my dads extra car for free. The ex pays all the bills and necessities. She finally breaks down and gets a job because he stopped paying for her hair, nails, etc.  \n\nShe has a day when her child care falls through and sends out the same request I did. \u201cCan anyone watch my kid? I HAVE to go to work or I\u2019ll get fired.\u201d\n\nI told her I could absolutely do it! Then charged her the same bogus price she charged me. I told her it was the \u201cfamily rate!\u201d \n\nShe cussed me out.\n\nEdit: why would either of us get fired has been asked a ton. Here\u2019s why:\n\nI was scheduled to teach a seminar for about 400 people. This was extremely expensive to the company once you factor all the logistics of closing operations for a day and etc. If I would have last minute canceled, it would have cost them the same twice. Under normal circumstances, I can miss work for an emergency, but not during something like that. I\u2019m a salary employee so I usually work about 60 hours a week. Taking off after lunch or something isn\u2019t a big deal. It was just the magnitude of the event. \n\nShe worked a job that anyone was qualified for and was on the chopping block for missing work all the time. \n\nAlso\u2026 it was not her livelihood. At some point before she got with my step brother, she was babysitting for a family for a couple of weeks but they fired her for being unreliable. She recognized the position I was in and threw  out a number bc she knew I had no choice but to pay it. \n\nAlso note: she cussed me out when I tried to charge her the exact thing she charged me, so no. I wasn\u2019t just being cheap.",

They vary in quality - I'm on a really good one that stopped accepting new members in 2005.\n\nSo... we are comparing apples to oranges here.\n\nBut we don't need to be - it's been shown many many times that while the USA pays far more than other OECD nations, the payers get far less benefit from those payments. \n\nIt's almost as if private businesses can't deliver a better result than a govt funded healthcare + pharmacy system! What with the bulk purchase ability of a national govt compared to the relatively tiny individual purchases made by dozens of far smaller private 'for profit' businesses. Whodathunkit?\n\nGovt: I'll buy an entire container ship full of drugs from you.  \nPrivate business: I'll buy a seatainer full of drugs from you...\n\nMost OECD governments negotiate bulk purchases of common drugs with pharmacuetical companies - who when guaranteed massive sales discount their drugs significantly - it's an entire nation buying them! Thus common medications can be provided to citizens at quite low costs.\n\nUnless you're in the USA which doesn't do that at all, nor do they have a taxpayer funded health system, despite vast evidence that doing both would cost citizens and the nation overall far less than what it currently does, resulting in a better outcome for everyone in the USA.\n\nNo, find your own links, there are many and have been for decades.

He told me not to ask for a ride next time then. It's been 25 years and he hasn't been in any of my or our families cars again. He did it to our other siblings. He has to drive to each event. Every Vegas trip for weddings and play. Alone. Going to grandpas in Utah for the reunion? Drove alone. Going to Baja for our parents wedding anniversary and renewal? Alone. No one will ride with or allow him to ride with. He was so awful as a teenager with it that even his friends still give him shit over it. He would charge them for riding to the store with him. It's cost him thousands of dollars in gas money and hotel rooms since. We all split, rent a car, van or RV and travel together.  He could easily give us our money back and apologize for taking advantage of everyone. He won't. This fall 5 of us siblings rented 2 RVs and will meet our parents along the way to Colorado. Multiple stops and camping along the way. Little brother will be alone in his car paying for every drop of it on his own and spending money on gas and hotel rooms. Some might say \"Oh, maybe he wants to.\" He most certainly does not, pride is a bitch that way. There are 6 of us and he pissed off all 5 of his siblings with this. None of us will back down. Our kids know.",

I pulled out my wallet and gave her the last $8 I had on my and she complains that it's not enough.\nFew months later her dad calls me up and asks if I can help them move her into an apartment off campus when she starts college. I said sure but she has to call me and ask. She does. I say \"How much you gonna pay me?\"\nI ended it dropping it since it was just going to be her dad's money that I would've gotten paid with.\n\nSome people need to grow up.",

It mind boggles me how money hungry and greedy some ppl can be. When knowing most ppl can't afford that for one day, I mean i think that's disgusting but that's just me I guess. Including ppl that want $20,$30 for gas just driving someone 5 minutes out the way, it pisses me off. It's like any opportunity to make a couple bucks by technically scamming ppl into it by tripling the price it should be is cool to them. I have family like that and I wouldn't do anything for them for free now.",

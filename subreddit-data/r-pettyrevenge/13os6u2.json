    "postText": "A few years ago, my ex and I decided to split. It was a hard breakup but eventually I started to get over it and eventually moved on. However, even though I had moved on, my ex and his best friend - let's call him, John never really did. To add to this, I was young and dumb when I started dating my ex, and so both my ex and John work with me.\n\nAfter the breakup. Leadership at work split my ex and me up and placed us in separate offices. However, they didn't know that John was living with my ex at the time and John remained on my team. Therefore,  John would constantly come up to me at work and excitedly say \"Hey MadCatScientist! Good Morning! How's your day going! Mine's Great!\"\n\nThis would always annoy me because I never really like John to begin with, and was only ever nice to him because he's my ex's best friend. Plus, it's fake. I know John enough to know that he was only doing it because he was getting under my skin with it. But we had to work together and I was too nice and professional to tell leadership I had a personal issue with John. Therefore, John decided that if I wasn't going to complain, he was going to do what he could to stay under my skin.\n\nThen, one day, I decided to get real high and mediate on the issue. Why did this bother me? Why does he keep doing it. Eventually, it hit me. John's just a bully, and getting under my skin makes him happy. So, I have to stop letting him get under my skin.\n\nThe next day, I got the drop on him!\n\n\"Hey John! Good Morning! How's your day going! Mine's Great!\"\n\nHe tried to respond, but the look of pure confusion on his face - that I of all people would initiate a conversation with him, and be so happy about it, blew his mind. It's the best victory I've ever gotten. But, I didn't stop. I did it every time I saw him for as long as I could keep it up. I turned the tables so hard on him that I've watched as he walked out of his way just to stay clear of me. And there was nothing John could do. Because, we worked on the same team and I never reported him. So, he couldn't report me. Plus what was he going to report on? That I was being nice and asked him how is day was going?\n\nEventually, I moved on to a different team and while we still work in the same office. We are far more cordial towards each other. Yet, every once in a while when I see him preening about something dumb at work. I like to remind him that \"nah dog, you ain't nothin' yet. You can't even touch me.\"\n\n\"Hey John! Good Morning! How's your day going! Mine's Great!\"",

    "postText": "So I'm single again, after three years.  This is relevant because my ex-bf exacted his own petty revenge by cutting down the willow tree where we first kissed.  We had ducked under the branches forming a sort of yellow-green umbrella, almost completely blocking out the rest of the world.  It was an incredibly romantic moment, and I think more than anything else I'm mad at how that was ruined for me by his shitty move.  \n  \nI forwarded his text bragging about it right to the property manager of the fourplex we lived in.  But that's not the petty revenge, or at least not all of it.  \n  \nA couple of weekends later, I saw him out in the garden with a bunch of tools.  He had some kind of roto tiller thingy that he used to get rid of the stump, a pick axe, shovels, etc.  I learned later that in lieu of being sued and/or arrested, the landlord made him clear off remains of the old tree, excavate the stump and plant a new willow tree in its place.  I assume he had to pay them some money as well, but I have no way to confirm.  \n  \nSo the petty revenge: After an entire day of grinding, picking, digging, hauling dirt, etc. he got pretty mucked up.  Being the idiot he was, he decided to come up and ask if he could shower off before leaving.  And I said (you can quote me on this), \"fuck no.\"  \n  \nAnd so my asshole ex had to put his mud and sweat covered ass into his pristine Dodge Ram-something pickup that he treats like it's made out of cotton wool and needs to be kept in plastic sleeves like a rare pokemon card.  I watched his lame attempt at putting newspaper down on the seat, only to drop a thousand F-bombs after he noticed the newsprint rubbing off.  It didn't make up for the loss of a beautiful tree, or how he poisoned one of the best memories I had of our relationship.  But it helped to confirm that dumping his ass was the right decision.",

I even had photos printed out &amp; tacked onto my bedroom walls (along with other stuff I was obsessed with lol). A guy having a big truck like that definitely had me turning my head, but I\u2019ve never actually dated a guy that had a truck. \n\nI have no reason for such a big vehicle that doesn\u2019t have more cabin space. I have very rarely ever needed to haul anything (and was able to rent a uhaul the couple times I did), I don\u2019t have farm animals to trailer, don\u2019t have a business that a big truck bed would be useful for, etc. I also mostly drive long distance, so fuel cost would be too much for my wallet, never mind how expensive such a truck would be to buy. \n\nMy mom could utilize a big ol\u2019 truck, but she\u2019s happy with her smaller Nissan truck for her work needs (she\u2019s an electrician).",

Same cargo space as a minivan.  Four rows of seating.  Worse handling, sight lines, your groceries - which is the most you can carry - can get rained on, and more expensive.\n\nBut you aren't one of those wimps who drives a minivan.   You are a man and have a truck.",

I'm 6'8\", 350lbs, and I have a hard time fitting into smaller cars. I'm not saying it's impossible. \nI also now only purchase 4x4s, because I want piece of mind when traveling down a muddy or minimal amount of maintenance road. Right after my first child was born, we were traveling across the state in the rain, and not knowing the area, traveled down a dirt road that crossed a river at grade, meaning there was no bridge. The water was rushing, and I knew it doesn't take much to float a vehicle. So I stopped, and put it into reverse. All that happened was the wheels spun. I couldn't go forwards and I couldn't go backwards. My wife was freaking out, and the baby was fussy. I resigned myself to walking in the mud and rain to a farmers house I passed a half mile back. He started up his tractor, and we were able to pull my vehicle out. 2 weeks ago, and 20 years later, I revisited that spot, as I told the farmer I don't have any money, but I wouldn't forget what he has done. He had already gone on to greener pastures, I was informed. \nThat being said, 4x4s are also helpful in the snow. We get a nice helping of that every year. Now my kid is driving, and I worry about my wife traveling in less than fair weather, and tow trucks are expensive, so more piece of mind if I can pull them out with my truck and a logging chain.\nI do not, however, lift my trucks. And if I need to work her, I do. It definitely is not a princess ride, but I do what I can to take care of her. Sometimes, I think the trash can I installed between the front and back sees more use than a few of my trash cans in my house.\nMy parting words are Never judge a man by his clothes or his truck. You don't know what he's been through.",

Take it from a New Englander who is also an EMT... all wheel drive makes you go better, but doesn't do anything for stopping and turning.  My Corolla is safer and will get stuck less than your truck.  Your problem was bad tires for the conditions, not a lack of power.  Traction, not torque; torque makes things worse.\n\nYou have too high a center of gravity and too high a moment of inertia.  The extra weight can help with traction, some, but not a lot.  Snow tires and chains, not a truck.\n\nIf you have optimized your truck for plowing, then, sure.  You will handle in the snow better than I will - because you have put in a proper suspension, stud tires, and can lift your front end somewhat by raising off the plow.\n\nBut all you are doing is increasing all the things that get you into trouble without increasing the things that get you out.  Stability control, traction control, ABS, snow tires.  Front-wheel drive, not  four-wheel drive. (Definitely not rear wheel drive.)",

She was a waitress, no actual use for the truck part of the truck, and only drove it to work where it sat in the far end of the lot or to home where it sat because her payments were so high she had to work all the time to afford the truck. Not that she had any other plans to use the truck as a truck. It was hilarious seeing her have to do everything but use a ladder to get into this thing.\n\nShe eventually couldn't keep up the payments on the truck or her apartment (despite her claims that she \"made bank\" as a waitress) and had to move back home and her dad sold the truck at a loss since she overpaid on the finance amount and agreed to \\~12% IIRC.",

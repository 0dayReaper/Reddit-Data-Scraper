    "postText": "My then-girlfriend and I lived in a house with very sloppy and rude people.\n\nThere were a lot of us, and one fridge didn\u2019t cut it. My girlfriend bought a used fridge out of pocket so that she could store her and my food, with the understanding that if there was room, others could share.\n\nTypical them, they took it over and again, hardly any fridge space for us.\n\nAfter a series of conflicts, they voted us off the island and we scrambled to move.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have room for the fridge in our next place, but we did have one thing- the knowledge of which breaker it was connected to. These are people who couldn\u2019t duct tape a brick to a stick, they would not be investigating the breaker panel. I don\u2019t think they even knew where it was.\n\nSo, once the truck was packed, a quick visit to the breaker panel and goodbye to $100\u2019s worth of their food.",

            "comment": "Before I got married, I lived in a rented house with a few other guys from work.  Biggest mistake I made was I didn't realize that this was the first time those other guys had lived outside of their parent's houses.  They expected me to act as their parents, including providing groceries (despite us having an agreement that everybody was responsible for their own groceries).  I didn't mind sharing if I was paid back (food replaced) within a week - and the other guys agreed - but things devolved to where they were helping themselves to my food and not replacing any of it.  And if I took any of their food they would get mad. BTW, couldn't padlock the refrigerator or cabinets because those all belonged to the landlord.\n\nLast straw was on Friday I bought a case of beer for the weekend.  Then my girlfriend called and talked me into going away for the weekend.  When I got back home, my roommates had not only drunk all of my beer but they complained that I had not left enough beer for them to last the weekend.\n\nFrom then on I only bought food that I knew they didn't like (and wouldn't steal).  They complained about it - I told them to buy their own food.  One cried that it was never like this at their parent's house - I told him to move back in with them.\n\nA couple months later I married my girlfriend and moved out of that rental house.  After I took all my stuff, I noticed that the house was pretty empty.  I was supplying the TV, stereo, living room couch, and most floor lamps.  The lamps was most noticeable since this was an older house with just one light in the center of the ceiling (in most rooms - some rooms had no ceiling light at all).  The place was really dark.\n\nThey were grumpy with me at work from then on.  To this day I am not sure that any of them ever really matured.",

There were two refrigerators, one of which had been left by a former resident but wasn't being used because they hadn't cleaned it before they left - or possibly ever - and it was **gross** (I thought they'd left a couple of mini-pizzas in there, but it turned out to be cantaloupe halves with various mold colonies).  Everyone was using just the one, and I got tired of assholes stealing my food. I didn't know about frig locks, or maybe they weren't around yet. (I am an old.)  \n\nMy solution was to buy a length of chain long enough to loop around a frig and through both handles, plus a padlock with two keys. I cleaned out the disgusting frig and gave the other key to an older international student. I knew he wasn't one of the thieves, as I'd seen him cooking many times and we used very different ingredients.    \n\nWhen I moved out, I gave him my key and told him to keep it going. :D",

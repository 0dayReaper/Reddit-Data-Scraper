    "postText": "Back in high school, we were a group of friends that had been together since Grade 1. We were in an all-girls school. There were two girls who would always even though we hung out and were supposed friends, would always treat me horrible. \n\nWe would always exchange little letters, and I remember the one girl literally giving a note to everyone in our friend group except me but doing it obviously so I could see and feel bad, then blatantly ignoring me.  So being 15 at the time, feeling a bit horrible, I decided to cue my petty revenge. \n\nOur group of girlfriends were about 12. In our entire grade we were 104 children. I spent the entire weekend, making notes for everyone in the grade excluding this horrible frenemy. Monday I handed them out during our grade gathering, and blatantly ignored her as she did to me, and pretended as if there was nothing wrong. My close friends told me years later, she felt really horrible, and complained about it, then they pointed out her behavior. Needless to say, we never became friends, and I'm not sorry, because she hasn't changed and isn't friends with any of us anymore, but we all stayed close. For context - This is in RSA.",

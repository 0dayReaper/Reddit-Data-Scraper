    "postText": "When I first graduated highschool I started temping at a warehouse where we did QC work for a car company (we just made sure the seat reclining system worked and the support springs weren't going to pop)\n\nThe temp contract had a clause that if you worked 100 days you'd be brought on permanently with a raise (which meant they'd rotate everyone out on their 99th day) \n\nWhen I was Around my 80th day I was talking about home brewing beer with some other guys I worked with (no, I couldn't legally drink, but I grew up around home brewing) and the boss came by and started asking us about it. I mentioned that I was going to be bottling a red ale soon and asked if he wanted some. He was happy to accept and after about a week I bottled the ale and made excuse a few times before bringing him the 6 pack on my 99th day. At the end of the day when the boss was walking the work area with security guards I knew what to expect.\n\nWe were let go because their wasn't enough work (after hiring 20 new people last week) and the security guards led us out\n\nOn the way out I looked over at the security guards \"I'm not trying to make him mad, but do you work for (boss) or (car company we were contracting for)\"\nI was told they worked for the car company \n\"Well. I thought they had a zero tolerance policy for alcohol in work areas\"\nThe other guys who'd seen me give him the beer see what's happening and the security guard agrees that yes,  if anyone had alcohol on the premises would be fired\" and I let him know that the boss had a 6 pack in his office.\nWe were shown out and went home. Within a week I had information from other people in the warehouse. The guy hadn't just been fired because he didn't just work there. He was contracting from the auto company so he breached by having alcohol.\nHe lost the contract so he was personally out for all our pay for the last quarter, he had to pay back rent for his time working out of the auto company owned warehouse, and he had to pay a penalty for not carrying out the contract.",

    "postText": "My (ex)husband and I met when our best friends married each other. He was the best man, and I was the maid of honor. \n\nAfter a couple of years we all lived in the same community and had our 4 children in the same time frame. We hired my friend, let\u2019s call her \u201cHobag,\u201d to be our attorney for our business when we thought about selling franchises. \n\nHobag and my ex, let\u2019s call him \u201cDog,\u201d spent lots of late nights working out the kinks in contracts\u2026.*and more.*\n\nOne July they had to go to NY for a week to \u201cinterview prospective franchisees.\u201d Her (ex)husband called me to say he\u2019d hired a detective who followed them and saw them all lovey-dovey, and that they only had one hotel room.\n\nWell, since it was July and sizzling, her front right minivan window was open about 2\u201d. I took it upon myself to pur\u00e9e a few raw shrimp with chicken broth and strain the solids out. Then I fed a long tube down to her rear passenger carpet,  and under the seat as best I could. (I didn\u2019t choose the front seat because it had removable mats.)\nI then slowly funneled about 1/2 cup of my potion down the tube. \n\nThat week it was over 90\u00b0 every day. It was ghastly. A triumph! Her husband and I didn\u2019t let on that we knew about their affair until we\u2019d each had consultations with every good lawyer in our city, and had our financial ducks in a row.\n\nPetty, **effective** revenge I don\u2019t regret.",

That\u2019s the highest punishment a bar can give, and in this case would be highly inappropriate without an egregious violation of the fiduciary relationship, which is extremely unlikely for a simple contract formation. You basically have to commit a felony to get disbarred, and a bad one at that.\n\nThere\u2019s also nuance to the model rules and state rules. Not every state even disallows sexual relations; and the ones that do are following the model rules, which has an exception if there was a prior consensual relationship.",

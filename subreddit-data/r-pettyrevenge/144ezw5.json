    "postText": "I am a guard for a distribution center. Security is responsible for checking in trucks and getting a door. I have two lanes, trucks pile into both and I can (with another guard) check in two trucks at once. \n\nI finish checking in one truck, the other guard finishes his, receiving clerk gave us doors for both at once. The other guard has to go do something else so I am left to give them docking instructions and send them off. \n\nI just walk to the truck closest to me, and halfway through my spiel I get interrupted by an airhorn. I ignore it and carry on, and then can barely hear yelling over the 4 diesel  engines running nearby. \n\nThe other truck driver who\u2019d honked was going on about how he\u2019d been here first (he had, by about 3 minutes) and he should be sent off first and started arguing with me before I even got up to his cab. I just tell him he can wait and to be quiet while I give him the docking instructions. He finally does and I send him off.\n\nI went back into my box, called the lumpers, and told them to unload his trailer extra slow.\n\nHe was among the last to leave today.",

Breaking down really pissed him off. Anyway, I used to work in a lumber yard as an office girl so I told him to always be nice to the office girl. She can make or break your week by shuffling your paperwork in the stack. He was always getting loaded early or getting the choice stuff for his company if there was a difference. He was nice to the loaders/unloaders, too. He could get loaded in under 8 minutes some days. He never had problems with security either. They would watch out for him if he had to stay the night at the yards. Being nice is so much easier. Wish more people would try it!",

One paper mill I used to pick up at regularly near Syracuse, procedure was to park in the holding area, walk up to the shipping office to be assigned a door, then back into the door.\n\nOne trip, after I back into my assigned door, another driver is swearing. He had parked in the holding area, walked in, and been assigned a door - but while he was walking back to his truck a second driver had pulled into the open door. Truck is in the door, dock crew starts loading the cargo for the truck assigned to that door. \u201cPoaching\u201d driver only realizes something is wrong when he goes in for his paperwork and is handed a customs form, asks why he needs that - his load was going to Kentucky. Cue dock crew unloading his truck and loading the cargo for Kentucky. Could have been worse - truck that arrived after the poacher was going to North Carolina. If he\u2019d poached its door, rather than a door assigned to a Canada-bound truck, there would have been no customs form, so he\u2019d have gone to Kentucky with the wrong cargo.\n\nIt gets better. As he\u2019s pulling out of the dock I see that one of his trailer wheels isn\u2019t turning, so I let him know. That wasn\u2019t the only problem - his truck was taking longer than normal to build air pressure (he told me). Turns out he didn\u2019t realize this place uses gladhand locks, and he didn\u2019t realize his red air line was still disconnected. Truck should have been losing, rather than building, air pressure - and the hub that was turning must have had its brake badly out of adjustment.",

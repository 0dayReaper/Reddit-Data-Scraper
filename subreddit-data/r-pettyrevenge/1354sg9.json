    "postText": "First of all, let's get to the context  \n \n\nIt was the 5th year of elementary school, at that time I was constantly bullied by my whole class because of my size and my teacher never did anything to help me, which means I really hated everyone.  \n \n\nOne thing I have to make clear is that I always had gas at school, I studied in the afternoon and I always had lunch before going to school, and at lunch I always had beans or red meat, which always gave me stomach aches, I would tell my mother not to make these foods but it was all we had so nothing could be done.  \n \n\nContext given, story time  \n \n\nIt was the last day of school, and since there was no 6th grade on that school it was my last day at that place, so I grabbed that chance hard. It was a very hot day so I knew the air conditioning would be used, i.e. closed room, perfect setting. That day I made a point of repeating my lunch, when my mother questioned I simply said that I was very hungry, and I went to school. \n\nWhen I arrived, I suffered my usual usual Bullying, but I didn't care, I was prepared. The class starts, they close the door and windows, everything I expected, a few minutes later I felt a strong flutter in my stomach.I knew something was coming, so I let out the first fart, long and silent, right under the air conditioner, at first i didn't think anyone cared, until i let go again, and again, and again, the smell was starting to spread throughout the room, i was about to burst with stomach pain, but it was worth it the pity. \n\nThe teacher started complaining \"Okay, who's farting?\" And there was no answer, until they decided to open the windows, only when they opened the room it got very hot, even with the air conditioning, so they decided to leave it closed anyway, I had stopped farting by then... until recess. The recess today was special, Hot dog with cheap grape juice, I took advantage the chance, I repeated as much as I could, drank as much juice as possible, exchanged the cookies I had brought for other people's hot dogs and ate everything as quickly as possible, at that time I felt like a balloon 100% full, about to burst. The 2nd period of class begins, windows and doors closed, air conditioning on, crowded class, same thing as always, it was time for me to start my show again. \n\nI farted, this time in a very rotten way, and the farts were long and deep, as well as silent (My Specialty until today) there were only a few minutes left until the end of class, and the teacher would not release the class until they admitted who was farting so much, it was the last day of school, I hated that whole class, and I would never see all those people again, so I did something I still don't regret, I I got up from the chair and stood in front of the teacher, I lifted my leg, and let out the most monstrous and smelly fart of my entire life, the class started laughing, some started cursing me, but I didn't care, I explained to the teacher that I farted on purpose and was sent to the principal, my mother had to pick me up that day, when she found out about the story she started laughing and said \"Now I that I can't let you repeat my food again\". Turns out I went to a new school that respected me this time, and I never had to fart like that again.  \n \n\nSorry if the post is too long, and sorry for typos, I'm using a translator to tell the story and I'm not good at describing events and writing in general.",

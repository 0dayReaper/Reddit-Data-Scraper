    "postText": "I was out to a movie with my friends last night. We come and sit down, and I realize pretty soon that this girl in the row behind us has her feet up on my friend David's seat. She's there with one of her friends. So David turns around and he says something like, \"uh do you think you could put your feet down?\" And I think they say something in response but I didn't hear it. The feet didn't go down. A few minutes later David says, \"hey, will you get your feet off my chair? It's extremely rude.\" And they still don't budge. \n\nSo I tell David that he should go find an employee and get them to talk to this girl. He does exactly that, and after a couple minutes an employee comes and talks to this girl. She is obviously pretty peeved but begrudgingly agrees to put her feet down. \n\nAfter the employee leaves, she puts her feet right back up. \n\nAt this point I'm pissed off. Why is it so important to you that you have your feet up on someone's chair? You're just being a brat. \n\nSo I get out of my seat, walk up two rows, sit down in the seat directly behind this girl, and stick my foot on the back of her chair and push it forward. They both turn around and try to say something to me, but I can't really hear them since the movie had started by this point, so I just say \"just watch the movie.\" \n\nI kept my feet up there the entire movie. It felt like I had done walls sits for two hours but I'm glad I did it.",

Say something serious, pause for a second or two, then laugh awkwardly while staring. Also that's not the end of the interaction, so keep looking or waiting for the other party to say something.\n\n(There's a dude that does this at work. I don't think he's aware of it, he seems rather awkward. He's got four kids, two dogs and an ex wife though, so he's been more successful at life than I have. Or his ex is worse.)",

And this is when no one is sitting there, if someone was they'd be walking out of the theatre with me. \n\nThere's nothing worse in my opinion than being unnecessarily rude in public. There's no sense for it. If it's an accident sure, I stop stupidly in aisles when shopping or fuck up and not realize a car is stopped when I'm waiting to cross the street, but putting your feet up is fucking gross no matter how you slice it. \n\nI'm sorry you had to go through with that, fuck those parents, and you can't really blame the kid, he's a dick because his parents clearly like to encourage douchebag behaviour. If it stays that way, the kid is going to have a hell of a struggle not growing up to be the exact same kind of douche bag. ",

I really loved the movie, so I'd stay and watch it if I got out  and it was near the helms deep battle. This was within the first week so most nights still had a decent amount of people. Well there was a kid that would constantly be yelling at Frodo. He was being a kid and it was kind of cute at first, but eventually it was annoying. I turned to the dad and asked him if he could ask his kid to be quiet, we're all trying to watch the movie. He leaned forward and said \"why don't you just turn around and watch the movie.\" So I did. I was like 17. So after like 5 minutes, the kid hasn't stopped, so I turn around and look at him and tell him \"ive read the books, Frodo and Sam both die in the next movie\" and got up and left before the dad could react, since the kid immediately started looking like he was about to burst into tears. Not sure if he did since I pretty much got out of there as fast as I could but I like to think he did. ",

But ya, they're always super clean despite some of the mess I've seen people make.  One guy just spilled popcorn in himself and sat in it the entire movie. Like stereotypical slob kind of behavior where he can't fit an entire handful of food in his mouth so he just gets everywhere and his shirt was stained and everything... \n\nStill super clean though.  It's the greatest. ",

I call him an asshole and remind him I was sitting there before he got into the theatre. He asks if I'd like to settle it in the lobby, I'm like 19 at this time and pretty pissed off so I jump to my feet and make my way down. You know the hallway leading out of the movies are usually pretty narrow,  this dick head decides to push me into the wall on the way out. So we get out into the lobby, he's in his mid 40s picking a fight with a kid. He gets in my face,  I knee him in his thigh,  he went down. My friend and I book it out of there before we can get in any real trouble. I still haven't seen the end of that movie. I wish I had done something like you but I've always relied on my size rather than my brain. ",

I turned to say something but before I could my then fiance(now wife) turned and looked right at the guy (she has a glare that can kill) and says \"STOP TALKING AND GROW UP!!\" \n\nThis must have gotten to him because he stood up and said \"come on guys, this movie is stupid anyways\" and then leaves with his kids.",

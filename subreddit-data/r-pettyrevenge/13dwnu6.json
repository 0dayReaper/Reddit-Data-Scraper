    "postText": "I worked for a large Midwestern (US) company that was acquired by a huge East Coast (US) company. There, I managed the internet services group, which had built out a content management system, and provided free website development for internal organizations. With our tools and skills, our small staff generally completed these sites in hours to days. The acquiring company didn't provide a common service company-wide, so each of their organizations farmed out similar work to agencies that charged hundreds of thousands of dollars, and took weeks to months to do the same work.\n\nWe were asked to prepare an extensive HR (\"Human Resources\") site for the impending acquisition, including lots of forms with back-end databases, and documents for the newly-acquired employees, plus a fancy animated logo. All the documents, graphics, etc. were placed into the content management system back-ending the web infrastructure. We launched the site in 18 hours, at no cost to our internal client. They were flabbergasted that we could provide this service, so quickly, so accurately, and at zero cost.\n\nIt quickly became clear, however, that the acquiring company had no intention to retain the local employees of the acquired company, with layoff notices being distributed at a steady pace, including to members of my team.\n\nWe replaced the nice, cheerful animated GIF logo with one that would repeat the desired animation for five or ten minutes, and then, if the web page was left open long enough, would display a rude (very rude) message for the acquirers. Because of our content management system, and re-use policies, the logo GIF file couldn't be deleted or replaced if it was also used in some other web site, so we made sure to use it in many sites, open to the public or not.",

You might be able to find it, or an equivalent, online.\n\nThe trick is to set up a number of display sequences:\n\n1. Display \"happy\" static image for 30 seconds\n2. Display \"happy\" moving stuff for 2 seconds\n3. Display \"happy\" static image for 30 seconds\n4. Display \"happy\" moving stuff for 2 seconds\n5.    repeat on and on for as longt as you can stand it - this lulls them into a false sense of complacency :-)\n\n   ...\n\n   92. Display \"rude\" image for 200 milliseconds\n\n   93.  Go back to step 1",

I'm assuming either \"we launched the site in 18 hours\" refers to only to go-live, or that your definition of \"extensive\" is a lot different than mine.",

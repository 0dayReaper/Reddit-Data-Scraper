I have the final call as a supervisor, since I\u2019ve got six year seniority, even though I only work 8 days a year. Five years ago a police officer gave me a citation for driving 5 MPH over the limit, even though I hadn\u2019t received a citation since 2001.\n\nTwo days ago, a ride operator called me because someone was upset that his child wasn\u2019t tall enough to ride. Although I could have allowed his child to ride, with adult supervision, I recognized the officer and denied his request. \u201cYep, 5 mm under, officer.\u201d I\u2019m sure he understood after that as his child bawled. AITA? Yes, why yes I am.",

In VA it's $6 per mph over the speed limit, hitting reckless (and thus adding another hefty fine on top of speeding) at either 80mph or 20 over the speed limit, whichever is lower. However, many officers will deliberately avoid writing reckless tickets to avoid doing the paperwork and mandatory court in cases where the reckless driving is 80+ in a 65 or 70. (Many officers don't give a shit about paperwork and will happily write you for reckless, especially state troopers, but many of them can't be bothered and would rather cite for stuff that doesn't involve mandatory court or an arrest.)",

She hadn\u2019t had a ticket in like 20 years. She was driving through our town when a towny cop pulled her over. He asked her if she had any tickets and she said \u201cno, not in a very long time\u201d. He then proceeds to write her a ticket for 3mph over! \ud83d\ude44And when he handed her the ticket, he said, in a sarcastic mocking tone, \u201cWell, you do now!\u201d as if it was funny. And he did like a little skip/dance back to his car. My mom is the nicest person and she was always really respectful. It always made me so mad that that cop treated her so shitty for really no reason. When he pulled her over for speeding, if you want to call it that, she was going down a small hill. Coasting. Lol.",

My mom really didn't like him because one day after a 17 year old kid crashed in front of our house ,he responded and began berating/ interrogating the kid. My mom reminded the kid he could wait until his parents got there to answer the questions. The officer told my mom to shut up and go back to the house. \n\nA few years later my mother's boss was a part of a funeral procession, that officer was on motorcycle duty. He, by his fault alone, drove into my mom's bosses car and he began to berate her for the collision. The motorcycle was brand new. His ass was handed to him by his superior as he was clearly at fault.  He was yelling at the wife of a recently deceased Police Chief during the funeral for a former Fire Chief. He retired soon after.",

Our one fun thing during summer before going back to school, so it was a very rare treat for us. \n\nMy father had a Very healthy respect for the law and refused to speed even when it angered drivers behind him, but he did pull over whenever there were more than 5. He was shocked to be pulled over on a lonely stretch of highway, so when the cop asked him if he knew why, he said no. The cop said he was driving ONE mile over the limit. My father said he was paying close attention to his speed and said he would not have done so. The officer noticed that the tires on the vehicle were not original and said that this must have made the odometer incorrect. He issued a ticket and ruined my fathers perfect driving record. My father was furious, because as a young man, insurance was already very expensive and now it was more expensive for much longer. We were a poor family and this made a the difference between getting new school clothes and hand me downs for my brother and I. My father was the sole provider for our family and could not take off work to fight it; I don\u2019t even know if that was an option back then, it was in the mid 70s.",

Cop asks for ins and reg, and he apologizes again and quickly gets it for him. Cop goes to his car, calls to check license and ins, then returns everything and thanks my husband for his service to our country. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \nLucky day.",

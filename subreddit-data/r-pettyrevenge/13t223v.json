    "postText": "So when I was in high school, I was on the speech and debate team. If you're unfamiliar, think drama club meets young democrats/young republicans. I mostly did the public speaking events that focused on real-world political topics, and I loved it. I usually made it to finals in my events, but I had fun even when I didn't, and made some really great friends from other schools. If I wasn't in finals, I would go watch others who were competing to support my teammates. \n\nThere was a girl I saw at almost every tournament. Let's call her M. M and I didn't do any of the same events because she focused more on the drama side of speech and debate. But M was constantly comparing herself to other people, and would get really arrogant if she made it to finals in her events and I didn't make it to finals in mine. Any time she didn't make it to finals in her events, she would cry and accuse the judges of not being fair, and would then pout in the cafeteria all throughout finals and sometimes wouldn't even go to awards to support her teammates who did win something. In conversations, she was also a big \"one-upper.\" You could never talk about anything fun or cool you did, because she'd always done something cooler or more fun. If you've ever seen Glee, she was a real life Rachel Berry. \n\nShe and I are still friends on social media, although we haven't personally spoken very much since high school. I've watched her flaunt now two different failed engagements, along with a slew of random jobs that never seem to work out for very long. I don't post as much on social media, so she didn't really know what was going on in my life.\n\nMy long term partner and I found out in early March that we were pregnant. We had been trying for a baby and didn't think it would ever happen because we had been told by doctors that our chances of conceiving naturally were slim. So this baby means everything to us. \n\nBefore we even got pregnant, we had agreed on a name for our baby, if we were to have the boy we both wanted. In high school, my grandmother had told me that if she had ever had a son, this was the name she was going to give him. However, she only had two girls. I fell in love with the name immediately and told her that if I ever have a son, I would give him this name. She passed away while I was in college, but I'm still in love with the name and fully intend to honor that promise I made to my grandmother. Thankfully, my partner also fell in love with this name when I told him about it.\n\nFlash forward to the present day. My partner and I were about a week away from finding out if we were having a boy or a girl, and then one day on Instagram, I see a post from M announcing that she is pregnant with a boy. She's due two months before me. At this point, I hadn't announced my own pregnancy publicly yet, so M didn't know, but some our mutual friends knew. One of them who was really close to her informed me that she had shared her baby name list with her and that the name my grandmother picked out was on the list. M had specifically said that she remembered me talking about liking that name at a speech tournament in high school, and that the name had \"stuck with her ever since,\" particularly because the name is shared by her favorite poet. She told our mutual friend that that name was her top choice, but her partner had a different preference, so they were still going back and forth about it. \n\nMy partner and I recently found out that we are also having a boy, and are using the name we love regardless of what M names her baby, because what difference is it really going to make, especially because we don't even live in the same state and these children will probably never meet. It's also not a unique/rare name by any means, so to us it feels silly to act like only one of us can use it. \n\nBut this is where I got my small dose of petty revenge. After we learned the gender of the baby, we decided to go ahead and announce our pregnancy publicly, and since we already had his name picked out, and it's something we know we're not going to change our minds about since it has so much sentimental value, we decided to include his name in the announcement. So M learned that I was also pregnant, having a boy, and using the name I loved. I would be lying if I said that I hadn't thought about M's reaction when my partner and I made the decision to also announce our baby's name. \n\nM hasn't said anything to me about the baby or about our name choice, but apparently she has had a lot to say to our mutual friends. She said if she can talk her partner into it, she still wants to use that name for her son, and that since her baby will be born first, if I do end up using it for my son as well, then I'm just copying her. She has apparently become obsessed with trying to find out details about my pregnancy and my relationship with my partner, since I don't post as much on social media. She's been harassing our mutual friends asking about me, to the point where several of them are starting to cut ties with her because it's getting to be too much. Even her partner has reportedly told her that she's going overboard, and has apparently vetoed this name for their son because he thinks she's too weirdly fixated on it and me and wants her to stop \"stirring the pot.\" \n\nSo I'm having a baby with the man of my dreams, getting to finally use the name my grandmother fell in love with decades ago, and as an added bonus, my friends from high school are finally seeing how weird M is for the way she constantly tries to compete with different people.\n\nEditing to add: for the people who keep commenting asking the name even though I shared it in like 10 different comment threads at this point, his name is Joe. \n\nJoe Mama.\n\nEditing again to add that if you didn\u2019t catch the joke and actually thought the name is Joe, that\u2019s on you.",

Relationship ended without kids. Later on, he announced the pregnancy - or even birth - of his first offspring and used one of the baby names from his ex. Which she now considered 'useless' on account of being seen as a copycat.\n\nI think that's bullshit. That Arsehole doesn't own the name in question, which was a bit out of the ordinary. Even if they moved in the same circle, it'd be a sweet revenge on him by still using that name.",

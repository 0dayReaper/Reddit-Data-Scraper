    "postText": "My ex was the definition of POS husband. He was abusive, couldn't hold down a job, and was a cheater. The kick in the butt to leave him was catching him with a girl in our apt. \n\nIt took me longer to leave than I wished but loving states away with practically no friends of my own I had to wait for the perfect opportunity to get out. When that day finally came I told him I was leaving. Told him that the next months rent was paid, he was on his own for the following month and then the lease was up and he needed to find somewhere else to live. Some say this was too nice buy my name was on that lease and didn't want an eviction on my record. \n\nWhat I also left him with was no money. I had switched my paychecks over to an account in only my name 6 months prior because he couldn't be trusted with our joint account and was spending money on unnecessary things leaving us short on bills multiple times. He also had no job, he lost his last one (I think that was number 4 in the 3yrs we were together) AND to top it off he didn't have the ability to get a new job because his Permanent resident card had just expired. We had been saving money to get it renewed as I was planning ahead but once he lost his last job we needed to use that money for bills so it was gone. \n\nSo to sum it up 1.No money all the money I took was from my job so it was mine 2. No job 3. No ability to get a job and 4. No car. Car was in my name and I was making the payments \n\nAs far as the stuff I took from the apt. I only took my things and left most things we had gotten together including furniture that was his mom's anyways.\n\nSome people said I left him in a pretty fucked up position. But my whole marriage was a fucked up position so I feel it was well deserved.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: let's add some more cuz I didn't think this post would get so popular. I almost forgot I did this and THIS is petty for sure. So since we were still technically married at the end of that year and lived together enough of that year we could still file Jointly on taxes. Well I did the math if I filed separately I'd get screwed and owe, if I did it jointly I'd actually come out like $600 ahead and that was splitting it 50/50 with him. Seemed worth it. I asked if he wanted to do it and I'd take care of the filing and get him his half of state and federal. I did it all and Federal comes in and I send him his half. Them state check comes in (our state only issues paper checks for tax returns) now I don't really NEED the money. I'm good. And MFer still doesn't have a car meaning I'd need to drive to him cuz both of us have to sign the damn check. So not wanting to deal with him I hold the check hostage telling him \"Nope haven't gotten it yet\" every time he asks \ud83e\udd23 he's getting very desperate and I'm really not caring. So then I telling him a few weeks later I got it. He expected me to drive another hour on top of my already really long commute I had at the time to meet up with him cuz he didn't have a vehicle. I'm pretty sure I told him \"and how is that my problem\" and told him No we can meet at my bank at this location. I'm not driving any further so figure it out. Again I wasn't in desperate need of the money so I didn't care if he couldn't make it. So about a month after I had actually gotten the check we finally cashed the dang check. And I gave him less cuz they took part for his ticket fine. He was like that's not half. No its not its your half minus your fine. I'm not covering for that. \n\nNow that I think about it that part seems way more petty lol",

Doing so will bring you joy. \n\nYou owe him more? Non, cher. He owes you, it seems you are forgiving a great deal of debt. You'd never collect, so may as well, but guilt? No no. The word you want is \"free\".",

Since my name was on Was on the lease too if he didn't pay the next month's rent and gotten evicted then it would be an eviction on my. Record and prevent me from getting an apartment in the future. So I paid it for me not him. He did manage to pay the last month's rent. I don't know how but then like an idiot he signed another lease with just him and got evicted shortly after like a dumb a**",

Him being evicted might have ended up homeless for a bit to recover, plus he'd have the eviction on his record. And he's is definitely an idiot for getting evicted later on. Good on you for doing what was right for you!",

He put his fist through the wall when I caught him with he other girl in the apt. I had came home early for my lunch break. Door locked which was odd when he was home. Came in to him standing in the living room pulling up his pants with an obvious hard \ud83c\udf46 . He starts to feed me some BS story about some homeless chick needing to use the bathroom as I'm looking around the living room and see her shoes, her sweatshirt, her vape, her phone plugged into my charger. She was hiding in the bathroom. Once I realized what was going one which didn't take me long I was like \"what the hell?\" And he kept telling me nothing happened. I shouted towards the bathroom \"you need to get the fuck out!!\" She came out grabbed her stuff and left. And he continued to deny anything was going on. And I'm like \"stop lying to me it's obvious\" then he punched a hole.in the wall.......by that point I had my mom on the phone cuz I knew he wouldn't come after me with her on the phone. But no alcohol was involved. \nHe even flipped his lid and got into an altercation with my Dad when he was visiting once. My dad was an alcoholic growing up.....never laid hands on me or anything but he hand anger issues. Dad woke up grumpy from taking a nap cuz he had a migraine. He said something mildly rude to me like not even a big deal and probably would have apologized later. And I get it I get migraines too. But my ex started going off, like it was so bad I was trying to keep my ex away from him and from hurting my dad cuz even tho he could have my dad didn't take a single swing at my ex. I held him back long enough to let my dad grab his shoes and his coat and he left for a bit. But looking back I cannot belive that monster came out just like that. No alcohol no drugs nothing it was just him and its almost more terrifying in a way.",

Fully aware and our actions against people who've hurt or wronged us are carefully thought out...for a reason. We know our capabilities. I can be mean and ruthless if pushed that far. I will admit I may have been considered verbally abusive to him after a couple years of putting up with the physical abuse and stress and hurt and always seeking out other girls I hit the point where I'd tell him how dumb he was for x, y and z. I was mean and cold at the end cuz I was soooo done. \nBottom line it may take me awhile to decide I've had enough, I'll put up with a lot (too much really) but once I'm done I'm DONE and will never look back and I will often hit them where it hurts or like in case let them deal with the consequences of their own actions with Zero remorse.",

His choices, like not getting his status card renewed, squandering money that wasn't his, inability to hold a job- none of that is your fault. He isn't your responsibility.  You enabled him to be a lazy loser. But now he has to step up and be a grown up and manage his own life. He is where he is because of his own dumb decisions. You worked while he did nothing. Now he will either get it together, or live on th street. You've done enough. It didn't work out. I bet he thinks you are very unfair. 'How could you do this to me\". Poor guy. He can't catch a break, right? Everyone is out to get him. Boo hoo. Thank goodness you got out. Don't look back. New man, new life. You win. Nothing to feel good about. If he were smart, and gets it together finally, than you leaving was th best thing for him. ( I doubt that will happen. He will find someone else to use. Good riddance)",

He was in the mode of \"trying to get me back\" and giving me what i wanted so I could get away with doing things like this....all I wanted was a peaceful divorce and he let me have it.....mostly after lying to my face about where he was living when I asked him 3 times and put it on all the documents then comes clean he got evicted. Told him I don't care where you live! I just need the paperwork to be right! Now it's not! and I walked out. After that everything went fine. He still pops up from time to begging for us to be \"civil\" and I'm just like I am being civil as long as you leave me alone and I can continue on as if you don't exist \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f he seems to forget his anger issues and serial cheater tendencies. But 6yrs since all that and has been 3 since the last time I heard anything from or about him",

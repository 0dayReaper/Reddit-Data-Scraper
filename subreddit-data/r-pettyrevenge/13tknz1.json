    "postText": "My great grandmother was the most racist hateful and disgusting person I have ever met. She was mean as hell all the time, always had to have the best in everything, and treated us poorly for stupid reasons. This evil woman died because she would not accept a blood transfusion in case it had a black person's blood in it. She was homophobic, greedy, spiteful, and told my mother about me and I quote, \"If that girl doesn't get her life together she's gonna end up dating one of those brown boys.\" If she gave me any gifts, they were cheap, and fell apart, but my brother, she would spend like 200$ on. With that being said, she had the most bomb ass mocha cheesecake recipe ever. She swore she was taking it to her grave. This recipe was fanfuckingtastic, I LOVE it. But she would never share it with us. \n         Recently my mom found an email that she didn't know about. My grandpa, (GG's son) snuck the recipe to us through email before he died, knowing full well that Gg wouldn't give it to us. Now, I'm trying to give the recipe to anyone and everyone who wants it, ESPECIALLY the \"fags and brown boys\". In fact, I have asked my girlfriend to make it for me, and will be posting the recipe on TikTok too. My mom posted it on Facebook. I hope that woman rolls in her grave knowing that the only good thing to come from her was cheesecake, and that when she tried to be greedy and refuse it to us even then, that now all the people she most hated will be enjoying it with immense satisfaction.",

I recently made a plain cheesecake using vanilla bean paste (along with orange and lemon zest) and was blown away by the taste. I\u2019m not sure about with chocolate because I really like the flavour where it is now.\n\nEdit: the tiny speckles of vanilla beans really make the cheesecake look that much more appealing.\n\nI\u2019m working on a blueberry sour cream cake (which is a lot like a cheesecake) and hate the brown hue brought on by regular vanilla, I\u2019m hoping that the paste will add only speckles and not change the colour of the cake. If I ever perfect it I\u2019ll post the recipe.",

It's been common anywhere that refrigeration was unavailable, and it's a key ingredient for authentic key lime pie.  I've only ever bought it for desserts, but a coworker used to use it in their coffee because they lived alone and didn't drink milk at all otherwise.  And I've always wanted to make dulce de leche by heating an unopened can of condensed milk in boiling water just because it sounds like a science experiment.",

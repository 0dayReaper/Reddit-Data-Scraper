    "postText": "This story came up while my dad was sharing an anecdote with me, and I honestly think it's one of the funniest stories of petty revenge he has ever told me.\n\nAnyway, my dad has this hobby of doing close-up magic. He knows plenty of tricks with coins, cards, and especially rope. This story dates back to the early '80s when he was performing for a party. The show was going without a hitch as he performed some of his best tricks. By the way, when I say \"close-up,\" I mean within arm's length. The spectators were all gathered around my dad, observing the items in his hands and, as I would imagine, gasping in awe when the trick is in action.\n\nThe trouble started while he was doing some tricks involving coins. While everyone else was focused on him, this one guest seemed to be doing everything to be a genuine a\\*\\*hole. Drink in hand, he was heckling at my dad, and while he (my dad) doesn't recall exactly what he (the guy) was saying, he (my dad) does recall that it was loud enough to overpower his (my dad's) own words. Furthermore, this guy was most likely aware that people were trying to pay attention and didn't care in the slightest.\n\nThankfully, my dad came up with an idea to shut him up for the rest of the show. He finished the trick he was currently on, and switched over to some rope tricks. He started out with one of his favorites, where he physically takes a knot off a piece of rope and holds it in his hand before putting it back onto the rope. So, he did his best to ignore the annoying heckler to concentrate on his sleight of hand, and successfully separated the knot from the rope. However, instead of putting it back onto the rope, he leans over and just drops the thing into the heckler's drink.\n\nThe situation was hilarious for everyone else at the party. After all, nobody would rather listen to someone heckling instead of someone doing cool magic tricks. Safe to say that the guy was rather irritated, but presumably after getting a new drink, he was quiet for the rest of the show. My dad's plan had worked. He had successfully dealt with an annoying person in one of the best ways possible: through humiliation. It is undoubtedly one of the funniest stories he had ever told me, and I just thought it would be worth sharing.",

    "postText": "A couple months back, my boyfriend and I went out for drinks one night at this cool little \"speakeasy\" in Montreal. It's actually quite an interesting place. You come in through a nondescript entrance and the place has a really nice vibe going on once you get inside. Note: this is one of those bars where the server comes to your table and serves the drinks rather than one where you order at the bar and take the drinks back yourself.\n\nWe were seated at our table by the server. We ordered a couple cocktails. And then a couple more, and then a couple more after that. Each time we had to order, my boyfriend or I would have to go fetch the server so he would take our order or go up to the bar, order, and then bring the drinks back ourselves.\n\nThen, when it came time for the bill, I went up again so he would come to our table. He came and thought we were going to order again despite me clearly asking for the bill when I went up. So, he went back to get the card machine and it was another ten minutes before he was back. At this point, I was quite ticked off at the not-so-great service and was debating whether or not I should tip him. The screen had an option for 10%, 15%, 20% or \"other.\" I decided to just leave 10% as I wanted to avoid an argument with the server. Montreal service employees are pretty damn notorious when it comes to the expectation of tips.\n\nNow, he prints out the receipt and takes a look at it and sees I left 10%. He then asks if we had a nice evening, to which my boyfriend responded that we did; we both thought it was just a standard question servers ask so we didn't bother telling him about the poor service received\u2013especially because it wouldn't really make a difference at this point. The guy then says, \"oh, well if you had such a nice time, than you should've left at least a 15% tip. Because, in Canada, it's customary to leave a minimum 15% when the service is good.\" I'm guessing the reason he felt the need to outline that's how it is in Canada is because I'm a brown guy.\n\nNow comes the petty part. I responded, \"oh I didn't know, why don't you cancel this bill and redo it so I can tip you properly. He said sure thing, just give me a second because the manager has to approve bill cancellations. Again, we waited a good 10 minutes for him to come back with the new bill. I was happy to wait, though, because once he came back, I put in the PIN and then selected the \"other\" option for tip and left him 0%. He printed out the receipt and his look of disbelief was well worth it. We got up and my (white Canadian) boyfriend said, \"Our only tip for you is to give better service and not be so much of an asshole. In Canada, we don't really like assholes.\"",

When I say massive, I mean two stories and a total of three different restaurants/bars inside. My mother went there with a few friends when it first opened up. After having bad service her and her friends left a small tip in cash, and that was that. Well, fast forward a few days and my mom notices online that her bill was about $15 more than her receipt showed. Turns out her waitress wrote herself a nice $15 tip on my moms card. My mom called up the restaurant and demanded to speak with the owner. I'm paraphrasing here but he said something along the lines of \"that's too bad, if you want anything done about you'll have to call the police and deal with it.\" This owner cares very little about his customers, shit like this appalls me.\nThis place is called [Five Palms](https://fivepalms.com). There are rumors that it's run by a drug cartel or something like that, because it manages to stay open with what appears to be very little business for 2 restaurants and a bar, but what do I know.",

I had none but felt more generous than average and looked through some pockets to see if I haf anything to give.\n\nI didn't, and so I told him. He just looked at me and pointed to another pocket I hadn't searched and said \"and there?\". I never use that pocket and knew it was empty.\n\nI just told him it's none of his business and he laughed before going away.\n\nThey are weird.",

HOW VERY FUCKING GENEROUS OF YOU!!\" he then rolls his eyes, turns around and tosses the money angrily in the register and walks down the bar away from me. i fully dear in the headlights'ed and just looked around, noticing all the shitty looks i was now receiving. fuck montreal.",

We're from Florida so we're accustomed to a large homeless population, and it was kinda surprising how few homeless people we saw there. We actually only saw one hunkered down by the door to 7-11, and my mom actually got $10 cash back with the full intention to give it to the man. \n\nMy brother and I were in the car, and when she came back, she told us about trying to give the man $10, but he thanked her graciously and told her \"but I've completely devoted my life to God , I don't take money from anyone because my life is in God's hands now.\" I asked her if I could have the $10 so I could see if he would take it from me, and she said sure. I (although I don't believe in God or follow any faith) went to the man and told him \"my mom told me you don't take money from anyone because you've put your life in God's hands, but I think God put our family here at the same time as you because he needed us to help you. Please take it, it's from God, really, we're just the messengers.\" \n\n\nAnd he started crying and held my hands and finally took the $10. I will never forget that because it was just my gut reaction, and even though I'd never thought of God in that way, something just made it pop into my head. I figured that since I had come up with something so clever, he must really really need that $10, because I'm never that quick on my feet.",

He isn't afraid, because he prayed for God to save him. \n\nA fishing boat comes by and sees him swimming, so they swing by and offer him a trip back to shore. \n\n\"No thanks,\" he said, \"God will save me.\"\n\nA little while later another boat comes by, sees the man, and again offers to take him back to shore. \"No,\" the man again refuses. \"God will save me.\" \n\nThe man stays out in the ocean, treading water and getting pretty tired. A third boat comes by, but again the man refuses a lift stating that \"God will save me.\"\n\nThe man gets so tired that he can't stay afloat and he drowns. As he goes up to Heaven he meets God and asks, \"I prayed to you! Why didn't you save me?!\"\n\nGod looks at him incredulously and says, \"I sent you three boats!\"",

He thanked my wife and I over and over, and even yelled loud enough for us to hear him say \"have a nice day\" after we rolled the window back up and were about to drive off. \n\nHis reaction really made our day. I'm sure they're not all like that around here but it just goes to show that there are some genuinely good hearted homeless folk no matter how bad the reputation is for the rest of their population.",

Yeah, I'll probably end up talking about it with the manager, and that takes time.\n\nIf the sauce is sickly sweet and the chicken is factory-frozen, I don't ask for something else because a restaurant who serves me that is going to be full of mediocre dishes.

We're dreadfully sorry, is there anything we can do to make it up to you?\"  And I don't want anything.  I don't want to hang out negotiating some kind of compensation.  I want to leave.\n\nIn the worst case, it actually can become an argument, but most of the time it's in the middle and they want to know more details so they have specific things to either apologize for or make excuses.  I don't want to waste my time giving details; I don't expect it to change anything and even if it does, *I don't care*.  I finished my food and just want to leave.\n\nMaybe you're hoping for a comped meal?  I'm not.  It's not worth my time.",

The place was known for staff with an attitude, but it was part of the vibe.  The attitude was all fun and games.\n\nSo, one night we get there, and only half our group has arrived.  We tell the hostess, and she says she'll seat us now and if we need a bigger table when our friends get there she'll move us to a bigger table.  So, we sit, and we order drinks, and we wait for our friends.  Fifteen minutes later our friends show up, and we can't all fit in a booth, so the hostess moves us to the table right next to our booth.  Our server throws a shit fit.  This isn't playful; he dresses down the hostess saying that she had no right to move us out of his section. He won't serve us at the new table, so I close out that bill and I spelled out tip on the table in pennies.  Our new server is charming, gets a decent tip.  On the way out I tipped the hostess $20 and apologized for the drama.  Our original waiter was glaring daggers as I handed that $20 to the hostess.  \n\nSure, they probably pooled tips, so he got a chunk anyways; but the look on his face was priceless.",

I didn't know if it was sprained yet because it had just happened. I was sitting on the couch with my foot elevated, compressed, and iced. Clearly I wasn't going anywhere.\n\nAnyway, my mom had heard about it and she messaged me that she was ordering me a pizza online so that I wouldn't have to worry about making dinner. She works nights, so she was currently at work and so even taking the time to place the order was difficult. As a result, she forgot to put in a tip, like I knew you could do when ordering offline.\n\nSo the guy knocks on my door and I stumble over to it. I take the pizza, thank him, and he stares blankly at me for a second before saying \"You know, it's customary to leave a tip when you get pizza.\" \n\nI tried to say \"Oh I'm sorry, I wasn't aware you didn't get one, let me grab some money\" However, I didn't even get the first two words out before the asshole turned around, and shut the door behind him. He was angry so he shut it hard, right on my newly-injured ankle. I yelped in pain and he kept walking.\n\nThe only thing I did was call the manager. I can only hope he was reprimanded or something.

On one hand I love to tip 15 bucks to a great server, and usually do. I'm almost always with my SO when we go out so we typically have a decent sized bill, and I'm not really one for the arbitrary percentage so I'll just tack on the 10-15 bucks for a tip, hoping to brighten my server's day even just a little bit, and because I genuinely enjoy the experience of a night out and the people who make it possible.\n\nOn the other hand I've had my fair share of servers like this who feel entitled to my money as if I didn't just overpay for food and drink in the first place. Legitimately had a conversation with a waitress at an establishment who did fuckall except take the order, she didn't bring our food or our drinks after the order. I tipped her 5 dollars (it was about a 60 dollar bill) and she seriously came by and picked up the receipt as we were leaving and said \"Oh ok, great,\" sarcastically, as if she even earned that tip in the first place considering she did nothing except punch it into the computer.\n\nServers are usually on far ends of the spectrum in my experience, they're either really awesome and friendly even when we're waiting for too long, which totally redeems the long wait, or they're miserable entitled folks with  very little patience for the job they choose to be at. Fuck off if you hate your job where you are expected to cater to people, find a new line of employment because you're making your restaurant look bad and yourself as well.",

    "postText": "This incident occurred a while ago in college during Freshman year.  Unlike some dorms, our dorm wasn\u2019t a Freshman only dorm so we had people across all 4 yrs.  A friend of mine was paired with a Senior.  His roommate was an ex-high school football player while my friend was the proverbial 90 lb weakling.  \n\nWhenever my friend received a care package from home, his roommate would eat it.  This happened a few times before my friend complained to us.  A group of us were taking chemistry and had access to Phenolphthalein.  For those who don\u2019t know, Phenolphthalein is a common chemical used in teaching Chemistry and also has historically been used as a laxative.  \n\nThe next time my friend received a care package, we spiked his food with the Phenolphthalein and lets his roommate eat the package as normal.  Of course, he spent the next day in the bathroom enjoying the food that he stole.\n\nThat was the last time he ate anything from the care package.",

I replaced my bar with a bar of frozen lard after I finished one morning and the roommate hopped in and waterproofed himself with no other soap around to clean it off.",

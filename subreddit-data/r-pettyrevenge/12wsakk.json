    "postText": "I spent several years working with a pair of malicious, vicious office bullies. Some of their hijinks included dumping work on junior staff, spreading told to them in formal confidence (HR), taking unapproved half or whole days off because \"they have to visit family\" (there was no family crisis in play), creating schedules and events to target/exclude/make miserable specific people (myself included), bossing around people who weren't under them, and more. These besties were competent at their work, extremely wealthy, good at concealing their bullying, and both identified with minority groups. This combo made them extra hard to discipline and the authorities felt it was almost never worth the confrontation. Any formal or informal discipline often led to threats for discrimination lawsuits.\n\nI tried so, so hard to just be better than them - kinder, more competent, more available to junior staff, etc. But the mean grind got to me. So I started lowkey sabotage. This included powering down their computers every night (of course I was always there later than them). Partially unscrewing liquids in their bags. Loosening cables at their desk. I got small pleasure from listening to them yell at tech support about their undiagnosed glitches.\n\nI spent several months listenting to their exhaustive plans for an exotic vacation, as well as their luxurious renovations to their new home. I was looking forward to them being away for a while, but dreading the extra work they were leaving by taking unapproved vacation.\n\nSo the day before their great move and exotic trip began, I shredded their IDs. Sure couldn't have been easy trying to travel and move without identification.",

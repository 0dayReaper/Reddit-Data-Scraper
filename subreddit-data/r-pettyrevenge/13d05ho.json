    "postText": "This was a couple of decades ago, so I feel okay about putting it out there now. When I was in 7th and 8th grades, I had a group of friends who were great...except for two of the girls (Not real names) Jen and Brenda. We actually got along fine most of the time, but at some point they decided that drama was super fun, and almost every week would choose some unlucky person (usually one of us other girls) to bully, rally the others to join in, and ostracize them from the group.\n\nFinally, it was my turn. Coincidentally, a boy that Brenda liked had expressed interest in me, but I had no interest in dating at that point and told him so. This apparently, still pissed off Brenda, and she and Jen started following me around between classes, throwing wadded up nasty notes, stage-whispering insults, telling all our friends that I stuffed my bra and that I was a secret lesbian (this was early 90s in the South, and although I was, and am Bi, they didn't know and I had little idea myself at that point). Administration could/would do nothing, since they weren't physically hurting me, and weren't doing things in front of faculty.\n\nThe climax came when I was in my gym class. A group of five, including Jen and Brenda, came to heckle me while our coach had stepped out. Where they were standing also happened to be a seating area where we stashed our books, since they wouldn't always fit in our gym lockers. I decided that after weeks, I was fed up dealing with their bullshit, so after they left, and class was dismissed to go change, I went into action.\n\nMy coach went into their office and everyone else was in the locker room changing, so the gym was empty. I went over, grabbed my textbooks, and went into the hallway bathrooms where I dumped them into the toilets and flushed. This took about 1-2 minutes total. I then went to change as usual, and walked out with everyone else.\n\nWhen we got to where our stuff was kept and started to gather it, I asked if anyone saw where my books went? My classmates helped me look, and we grabbed Coach as well. One of my classmates helped me out by saying that they had seen Brenda, Jen , and Co. hanging out in the area, saying hateful things to me while Coach was out of the room\n\nA classmate and I continued \"looking\" in the hallway bathrooms and \"found\" my ruined books. I cried, showed Coach, and he called the office to report Bren, Jen, and the others.\n\nThey all (of course) claimed they didn't do anything, but had been seen there and my classmates said that yes, they had been bullying me for weeks. All of them got suspended and immediately stopped their stupid games.\n\nI (much) later became friends with one of the others involved, and when they again apologized for their behavior, I finally admitted that I had gotten my own little revenge, and hopefully that had taught them a lesson. They actually thought it was hilarious (at this point we were in our 20s) and applauded my evil mind.\n\nTL;DR: was bullied by friend group, school wouldn't help, took matters into my own hands and got them suspended for something they DIDN'T do",

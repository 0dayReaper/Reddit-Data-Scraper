    "postText": "Originally by u/Mister_AA\n\nWhen I was a kid my mom caught me looking at a porn site and I claimed it was a popup but she clearly didn't believe me. A few days later when she wasn't looking I pulled the same site up on her work laptop and hid it behind her browser window and pretended to catch her in the act when she closed her browser and the porn site showed up on her screen. She was flabbergasted and claimed it was a popup and I was all \"yeah right because that apparently doesn't happen\" and she apologized for not believing me before.\n\nI was fucking diabolical",

It was clearly my younger brothers looking up things I would never watch. (Halo porn? Really?) I was able to easily convince them that no, I was not watching video game porn thank you very much. Of course, I was watching porn, but I knew how to hide it.",

When I got called into the vice principals office he showed me the note and asked me if I had passed why i would do something like that. I said it couldn't have been me bc that wasn't my hand writing. He then made me write tons of individual letters to compare my hand writing but I kept the curly script going the whole time.

I traded pretty much all of my Pokemon cards to him with the promise of a picture...The following day, he delivers. But I can't look because we're at school, so it gets folded and put in my pocket. \n\nAt recess, Patrick is playing and he has one of his pictures fall out. Teacher sees it, he gets taken to the principal. As we're sitting in class, he is led back to class crying and I watch as he points me and my friend Dustin out to our principal. But amazingly, she says nothing to us and takes him back to her office. \n\nI ask Mrs. Wesche if I can use the restroom and immediately hoof it downstairs. I flush the picture down the toilet without ever getting a good look at fake naked Brittany Spears.",

The classmate had, when asked what he was doing after school, responded \"I'm going to go on redtube\". When asked what it was \"It's like youtube, but more extreme\". My friend then told me how he thought it was like extreme sports and had showed this new site to his parents without checking it out first. That is why the classmate was disgusting. Then I went home and learnt a thing or two about myself..",

He pulled up Google, and single-clicked the search bar to reveal just TONS of porn searches in the search history. Tons. Like 3 dozen or more. And then he said \u201coooh you\u2019re in trouble. I\u2019m telling.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t me. I got off to late night Girls Gone Wild commercials on Comedy Central. This POS planted a ton of porn searches in the browser so my mom would punish me, allowing Uncle more computer time. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget that.",

Also just want to say I'm 98% sure it wasn't actually rape just those jav vids were the Japanese girls  make some crazy noises.",

My friend works in IT today.\n\nAbout half of everything we learned about networks and security, we learned circumventing that dad's systems. It was a cat and mouse game for a solid 3 years - he blacklisted the MAC address of the computer during certain hours, we learned how to spoof it; he instead whitelisted the MAC address of his computers, we learned how to hack into the rudimentary admin panel of the router; he installed various filtering services, we learned how to use proxies; he tried to lock down the OS user account, we started using bootable Linux CDs. As kids, all we had was time and the desire to see boobies. The dad stood no chance.\n\nI'm not sure I can replicate that kind of learning for my kids (they're still way too young anyway), but looking back I wonder if my friend's dad was actually playing us the whole time. You couldn't convince a couple of kids that learning all that stuff would be fun, but by making it a challenge he used our contrarian teenagerness to trick us into learning a career basically.",

Youre telling her to not play the game.\n\nIf my parents were like this while I was growing up in the 90s, I'd have absolutely loathed them. And communication online wasn't half as important then.\n\nRules like these don't stop children from participating in online chat. They just teach children to do it secretly, and then if something happens they won't tell you.",

And now that she's doing that, you've taught her that if anything inappropriate or scary happens to her over this feature you are the last person she should come to tell about because going to you = instant trouble when she can simply keep it a secret. Not saying anything bad will happen but you are setting up some very precarious learning blocks.",

Once they were in their teenage years, I shut that down. In some ways, ignorance is bliss, and you have to trust that you raised level headed kids at some point. Teens need a little privacy now and again.",

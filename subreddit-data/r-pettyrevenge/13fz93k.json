    "postText": "Working for a lady doing some drywall patching and painting. She had just had her new windows installed the day before, and there was definitely some residue from the previous crew. I did a pretty meticulous job cleaning where I had been working, including cleaning up debris that wasn't mine. I'm just about to wrap it up so that she doesn't get charged anything over the initial 4 hour estimate, but then she makes a point of walking me out into the living room to show me a few specs of drywall dust. Sure, those could have been me, tracking things in and out on my shoes... Happy to use my handheld Buckethead vacuum to clean up where I had been... But then she just keeps going.\n\nLiterally standing over me as I vacuum on my hands and knees and continuing to point out bits of fluff in her rug, specks of dirt, other debris... Stuff I definitely didn't bring in, in places that I didn't even work in her house. \n\nNo problem. I cost $60 an hour and once I go into the next hour, you're paying for the whole thing, even if it's 5 minutes....",

I can't do it myself, and good contractors are absolute artists with this stuff. (A friend whose husband worked construction let me help them redo the drywall on their house one weekend... it's *way* harder than it looks.)\n\nAfter a full day of replacing drywall so well you couldn't even tell there had ever been a hole, he started to sweep up the mess. We shooed him home; we can sweep and mop just fine, and the man deserved to go home a little early to his family.\n\nSeriously. We just look at our walls and marvel. We also recommended him to all the (nice) people in our building.",

For months. \n\nThe first couple of times the husband was out there watching to make sure they did it right.\n\nWhen they built one of those little sheds you buy from hardware stores, they ended up putting it directly up against the fence so the roof actually hangs over my parents side of the fence.\n\n They were real douchebags. The family that have moved in now though seem nice.",

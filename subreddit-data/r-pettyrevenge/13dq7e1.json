    "postText": "This happened years ago, but my then-boyfriend (now husband) and I had gotten into a huge fight and he told me to leave his house.  Then (as now) he rents one unit of a duplex, and I rent the other, so we pay a combined rent of $850 (Midwest US) for basically a 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom, 2-kitchen house with a walkway in the back.  I paid for and set up the whole house on internet, bought extra extenders, and did everything I could to make sure Wi-Fi was accessible to both units of duplex.  He knows shockingly little about setting that stuff up despite being 39 (younger at the time this happened).  \n\nBack to the story:  I can\u2019t remember why we were fighting now, but we were both probably very stubborn and let our egos control our emotions.  He tells me to leave his unit of the duplex, and I angrily left the whole house as I had an appointment.  Before I left though, I went through the ISP admin page and blocked his phone-and ONLY his phone-from the Wi-Fi.   Then I left for an appointment for a few hours and put him on DND.  \n\nAfter my appointment I checked my phone to find messages from him saying the internet is out, how does he fix it again, etc.  I replied that since he kicked me out of \u201chis house\u201d (his unit) my internet was not welcome to *his phone* and I told him that I only blocked his phone.  Not the PlayStation, his son\u2019s tablet, or even his bedroom Roku.  \n\nHe replied with the \u201cI\u2019m not even mad, I\u2019m impressed\u201d meme from Anchorman.\n\nTLDR; Significant other told me to leave his unit of the shared duplex during a fight, I blocked his phone from Wi-Fi and left for an appointment.",

You're paying well below market rate but have to deal with not having actual landlords to take care of things. \n\nI can see them not wanting to replace or do anything required by them because they are giving you a good deal. \n\nAs long as they aren't too bad and the pros outweigh the cons, I could see myself in a similar situation lol. \n\nFixing your gate would literally cost like a fraction of the cost of just one person on a Disney cruise lol, that would def annoy me as well.",

The pros do outweigh the cons: the cost of the rental allows us to save up and eventually buy the place, so we are staying here for the unforeseeable future.  However, they are really lax at letting us replace our own stuff.  They\u2019ll let me pay for the gate and take it off rent, provided I submit a receipt.  It helps that I\u2019m somewhat handy and save them a lot of money not having to buy and install whatever themselves.",

It's nice that they ultimately pay for all the repairs through rent adjustments cause I could easily see less generous people using the reduced rent as justification to not invest anymore in the property. Seems like a pretty good rent to own situation despite the negative aspects. \n\nBut damn do your in-laws want another grandson? I would love to be going on Disney cruises and to Paris lol!!",

House was an old 1 room school house, moved in and redone in the 50's. Only thing done since was new windows and siding. (New carpet by previous renters)\n\nA few yrs back, I got ahold of some nice 2nd hand cabinets for free. Made an agreement that i would foot the bill for the kitchen remodel if she would buy the countertop. Made sure she understood that it would be a nice countertop, not some cheap shit from Menards, about 2000-2500 for her. She agreed.\n\nFast forward to bringing her the bill....she had a full on melt down over the $2400 countertop bill. I ended up paying half the countertop bill, too....still upsets me today when i think about it.",

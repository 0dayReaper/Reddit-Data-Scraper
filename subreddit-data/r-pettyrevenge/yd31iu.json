    "postText": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (35m)  have a young brother \"Todd\" (29m) who had a complicated birth and had to stay a month in the ICU and because of that my parents have always doted on him and almost denied him nothing, even if it was to the detriment of my sister \"Abby\" (32f) and I. My brother drinks in on the attention and has on more than one occasion made himself the center of attention at either my, my sister's, or a cousin's special event.\n\nBecause of this Abby and I have a strained relationship with Todd and our parents. Unfortunately, Todd met and fell in love with \"Lucy\" (24f) who announced her own pregnancy at the baby shower my mom held for Abby.\n\nWhen I proposed to my wife \"Michelle\" (30f) I just wanted to elope but she really wanted her family to be there so I invited my family out of obligation. While out my best man \"Jim\" (35m) noticed a receipt from a jewelry store slipped out of Todd's pocket. Jim confronted Todd about this which led to an argument. Jim told me everything and I told Todd that he was no longer going to be a groomsman because I knew he was going to propose at my wedding. Todd cried to our parents and which led to a blow out.\n\nIn my parents' eyes, since Todd never admitted that he was going to propose to Lucy at my wedding I was unfairly judging him. I refused and brought up Todd's past behavior. My parents couldn't refute this and got Todd to agree to not try anything at my wedding. This wasn't enough to convince me to let him be a groomsman but I warned him that if, as a guest, he'd try anything I would make him regret it. Fast forward to the wedding and surprise surprise Todd walked over to Lucy and proposed to her during Michelle's father-daughter dance and did it in a way so that EVERYONE would notice.\n\nCue my revenge, Jim and I had hired a woman to pretend to be Todd's side piece who cornered Todd and Lucy and claimed that she was pregnant with his baby. Todd denied this but when she called his phone, I gave her his number and messed with Todd's phone to incriminate him, it didn't look good. Lucy threw the ring back at Todd and left in tears.\n\nWhen Todd saw the smile on my face he knew that it was me and I didn't respond to a single call/text from him or my parents until after the honeymoon. Lucy has thrown Todd's stuff out and has been denying access to their kid. Todd is furious and is demanding that I clear his name. I sent him a text saying that I had no idea what he was talking about as well as a screenshot of a bill for the wedding and gave a vague message demanding reimbursement for half of the wedding costs. Michelle knew the whole time what I was planning and gave me the green light after Todd ruined her moment with her dad, so I felt pretty good but now even Abby thinks I went too far.",

I just meant you won't be welcome at my events in the future\" when he brings up the hired \"pregnant\" woman, if OP wants, they can just say \"i honestly don't know who that woman was, and at this point I've got no reason to believe you're not lying about that too.\"",

Their egos are so fragile that they feel like admitting to anything that puts them in a bad light could cause them to spiral out.  So they avoid acknowledging responsibility at all costs.  The chances of ever getting even a pro-forma apology in the first place are basically nil.\n\nAs the most famous living christian leader in America once said, \"Why do I have to repent or ask for forgiveness, if I am not making mistakes?\"",

In high school this one wiry guy on the football team thought I'm be a great target. 3 years I put up with his shit because he wasn't worth the trouble.\n\nFirst day of senior year he smashes my driver's side window with a decent sized rock as a \"prank\" and I made the decision that that meant war. I went about my day and let him think I wasn't ready to cripple him for life.\n\nClasses let out for the day and I'm making my way back to my car  and that cheeky fuck thought he would rub in the fact that he broke my window. I didn't say a word, I just snapped, grabbed the back of his neck and pulled his face down into the trunk lid of my Ford focus as hard as I could. He lost 3 teeth and about 20 minutes of memory during which I calmly moved him out of the way and drove off.\n\nI have no idea how neither of us got hauled into the principal's office and expelled, all I know is that when he came back to school after what must have been a fun series of hospital and dentist visits he had a few visibly new teeth and a scar on his lip from where the corner of the trunk lid caught him. Yes, he left a dent that I never got fixed up until I was going to sell the car.\n\nI'l admit, had very few problems with me or my friends getting bullied after that, but it is not a method I can recommend.",

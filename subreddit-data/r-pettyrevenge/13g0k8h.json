    "postText": "I'm working Customer Support for a Casino Site (not telling which one for privacy reasons) so i'm used to people being rude and insulting me or my mother. Usually i don't think that much about it, i just insult back the client in my mind or out loud in front of the computer (doesn't matter i'm not doing Calls so no one to listen) and i think about something else.\n\nBut one week ago, here comes this awfull customer. The guy straight up starts the chat by insulting me with an homophobic insult. Never mind, i proceed with my polite and kind speech that i'm here to help. And there the guy is going on a rant for at least 10minutes. \"You are a thief\", \"Give me back my money\", \"You son of a bit\\*h\" and so on.\n\nI let him go on, then i'm asking what's wrong because so far it was just 10mn of NOTHING, i didn't knew what money the guy was talking about... Deposit ? Withdrawal ? Winnings maybe ? Hell if i know.\n\nThen the guy proceed to tell me that he played hundreds of $, lost them all, and wants a refund.\n\nSo i proceed, as kindly as i can, to tell him that the Terms And Conditions doesn't allow refunds of money played by the player (we have special rules if money was used by a third party or in case the account is hacked) and that i understand it's a bad news.\n\nI understand the news is not nice. I really do. But i'm not the one who wrote the rules, i'm merelly the one that tells them to people, and most people are not even taking the time to read the Terms and Conditions (i'm basically like a cop giving you a speed ticket, he didn't put the speed limit but everyone hates him anyway for giving tickets and reminding you of the rules). So when this guy started ranting some more and started insulting my mother, my family and wishing my death (even stated he wanted to run over me in his own car.) i saw red.\n\nI kept my cool, kept being polite and friendly, but the guy continued his BS.\n\nUsually we can only ban people having gambling problems or if they demand it. So far the guy didn't displayed any gambling issues and didn't demanded anything.\n\nBut i'm evil. And so i started planning in my head, i wanted to get rid of this guy, but i knew i couldn't just end the chat, since i already tried that with our \"Offensive Language\" template (basically an automated answer just telling you that you're rude and the agent doesn't want to deal with you anymore) but he was coming back everytime.\n\nSo i went for the \"least reasonable option\" and started pushing a little (but politely, i was never mean and i did so in purpose) to get the answer that would backfire in his face. At one point he said really bad stuff to me, like so nasty that i cannot even tell it here.\n\nBAM. You wanted to really insult me and wish for my death ? Well, i proceeded to Close the Account for absolutely offensive language, told my Superior about it, and he applied a Three Years Ban for this guy on ALL THE BRANDS of our company (like not even just the website i'm working for).\n\nI'm satisfied with myself. Some time passes (like an hour). And then, the SAME guy enters the Live Chat on my software and proceed to tell me \"I don't understand, why is my account closed and why am i banned ?\"............ I started laughing, but like really loud and with a really evil tone. My coworkers looked at me like \"That's it, he finally lost it.\", but i managed to answer the ex-client explaining that management found his language absolutely intolerable and banned him.\n\nI explained it to my coworkers, and they found it a bit \"unethical\" on my part to have done that, as i didn't have to push a ban on the guy. And it's true, i didn't needed to push it... But i WANTED TO. And it felt great, not gonna lie. And after reading the whole convo even my coworkers understood my move.\n\nPS : I know that losing money is a stressfull moment, i did lose money in my life as well. But in my book it doesn't excuse plain bad behavior and wishing death on people, and as bad as i am trying to let things slide and not take it personnaly i think that sometimes enough is enough. And the fact that the guy had the nerve to write me that he \"did not understand why he was banned\" after telling so many awfull things just conforted me in my decision that we were beter off without him. And to be honest i do not understand why we let offensive language slide in Customer Support Chats when gaming companies bans you for telling one insult in public chat to another player...",

And in order to know who to pay what amount we would write cards/tickets - always 2 of the same win - and one would be for us the other for the winner) \n\n\n\n\nAnyway, the guy lost his ticket, someone else found it and took the money and after talking with management I knew I couldn't fo anything for the guy as it was his fault he lost it. He cursed me out, threatened some not nice things and said he'll never come to us again. (He went to our other location XD)\n\n\n\n\nWe didn't miss the guy though, he'd often get very drunk and once he got drunk enough to vomit all over the outside door but of course inside our location",

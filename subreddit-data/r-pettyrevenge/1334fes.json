    "postText": "Found out about this sub from Smosh, hi! So I'm 27 (nonbinary but very fem presenting).and have been going to concerts usually alone since I was 15. And a LOT of them. So as you can imagine I have had to toughen up and stand up for myself because sadly sometimes shows bring out the worst in people. Both creepy ass men and unfortunately mean girl bully types are two things I have grown very used to but also super tired of.\n\nA couple weeks ago I was at a show (with a friend this time!) and before the show we started talking to the group of girls in front of us who were superfans of this band and had all taken time off and traveled to be at this show. All very kind and welcoming people that were lovely to talk to. One of them excuses herself to the bathroom and asks my friend and I to save her spot so we kind of fill in to hold it for her. Out of NOWHERE these two younger girls (at least 21 or had good fakes bc they were very drunk) come pushing from the back, shove my friend and I out of the way, and start giggling to themselves about how they made it to the front. I (as politely as I could at first) say \"Hey, sorry we're saving this spot for someone who went to the bathroom, she was waiting outside for hours\" to which one of them replies in the most condescending and fake tone \"Nooo honey look what's gonna happen is my friend and I are gonna stay up here and it's all good energy and good vibes okay? :)\". At this point I am FUMING and trying not to ruin this girl's self esteem with words. But I take a deep breath, smile at her and say \"Okay :)\" in the same sarcastic way. She turns back to her friend to  laugh about me. The other girl comes back and they get pushed back a bit but not too much, they were being so loud during quiet songs in the show and also yelling at the lead singer and calling him \"daddy\", everyone in the vicinity was glaring at them as well.\n\nMid-show this same girl has the audacity to turn to me and say \"since you were SOOOO supportive of her bathroom break earlier can u hold our spot while we go babe? :)\" and I actually kinda laughed out loud and said \"Sure I guess\". They leave and this sweet little 15 yr old girl who was there with her mom and had excitedly told me earlier that it was her first concert shyly asked if that spot was taken bc she was having a hard time seeing due to her height. I said not at all and nudged her forward. The mean girls came back, rolled their eyes at me, and then shuffled to a worse spot off to the side.\n\nI felt like I was caring for my inner child who was always nervous to interact with older people at shows and it also reinforced to me that there can be so many ways to get petty revenge that can sometimes also benefit others without hurting someome with words, creativity is key lol!",

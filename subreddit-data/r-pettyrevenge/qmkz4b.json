    "postText": "I used to live in an old renovated farmhouse with one apartment upstairs and mine below. I would have to get up for work at 3 am everyday. Hardworking mom upstairs worked two jobs for her very obnoxious kids. Everytime she worked an overnight shift, they would throw parties and be rowdy like a mother fucker. Loud music, banging on the walls, and what sounded like them bouncing medicine balls on the ground. \n\nI went up several times and knocked and told them, \"look, I'm not gonna tell your mom or call the cops, I just want some sleep. So keep having fun but please keep the noise down so I can wake up for work at 3.\" Did this several times in a week one time and they finally told me, \"go fuck yourself old man\" (I was 23). \n\nI knew my landlord and he knew I knew how to work on houses so he gave me the only key to the basement where all the electrical, hot water heaters, etc were stored. \n\nAfter being told to go fuck myself I had enough. I went downstairs, flipped off the breaker to the upstairs apartment, locked the door and went back for a peaceful night's sleep. Woke up at 3 and turned back on the power as I left for work. \n\nEveryday the parties got loud for the next two weeks, I would simply go turn off their power and enjoy a nice night's sleep. \n\nAfter that, no more parties. I think the message came through.",

Girlfriend at the time and I had enough of asking him to turn it down so put our speakers up against the wall and played Ween's 'Push the lil Daisies' and Lords of Acid 'Macho Man' in response. He got tired of that and threw a punch at the landlord who thought our choice was funny and voila, no more annoying neighbor.",

If it's afternoon/evening, I immediately blast music.  He doesn't care about the noise I make.  However, a couple of years ago I was having a problem with him doing laundry early in the morning - he knew I would get home from work at 5 am but he'd be running his noisy old washer at 8 am, which was right under my bedroom.  I asked him not to, but he would, anyway.  So on those days I set up a speaker under his bedroom and ran a playlist of YouTube videos of noisy old washers for a few hours starting at midnight.  If I can't sleep, neither can you.  It didn't always work, but my pettiness made me feel better.",

He took that as it was ok to do it all the time, playing repeating music clips (not even full songs)  until 10 or 11 at night. The next time he turned his music up, I put a speaker directly on the floor and blasted \u201cWhat does the fox say?\u201d as loud as possible. Never hear music coming from his apartment again.",

The bros above me would drink and party all night and literally wrestle to the point where the old lady who lived below me and was going through chemo would call and ask *me* to keep it down. It was every weekend, but also random week days and this would go on until like 3 or 4 in the morning. Slamming, screaming, crashing, legit WWE shit coupled with really loud EDM. Knocked on the door once but it was too loud and they couldn't hear me until I kicked the door about as hard as I could in rapid succession without breaking my toes. Two of the guys answered shirtless and sweaty, confirming my wrestling theory. It was so loud that I couldn't even hear my TV over their noise.\n\nAnyways, asked them to knock it off and they didn't so I called the cops who got them to stop, told the landlord and nothing was done, and this process repeated several times per week until I took matters into my own hands. One week night when they were particularly loud and stayed up especially late, I woke up around 7am to leave for work by 8:00am, but I duct taped some computer speakers to my ceiling (facing upwards) and blasted bagpipe music on repeat and left for the day.\n\nWhen I came home, the woodwork around my door frame was all scratched up like they tried to break in but weren't successful since the bagpipes we still roaring when I got in. They were blasting EDM to try to cover it, but bagpipes occupy a very unique sonic space and cut through just about any other sound. When I shut off the music, the EDM shut off moments later and it was blessedly silent.\n\nOnly had to repeat this process one other time before they got the picture. I moved out shortly after for unrelated reasons.",

I don't care how violent your sex is, the amount of clatter and commotion was simply not obtainable from even the roughest boffing. Plus the intervals wouldn't have worked if they were fucking the shit out of each other. I'm talking loud screaming and laughing followed by an extremely loud slam followed by more laughing and shouting and scrambling and slamming, complete with pictures falling off the walls and plaster chips being knocked from the ceiling for about 30 seconds at a time. There would be maybe a 2 or 3 minute pause, then repeat. It was clearly one or more person being knocked to the ground and others piling on top of them and wrestling, and from the amount of clatter, it sounded like someone jumping off a sofa to come crashing down on the other. It was unlike anything I've ever heard, and it went on at least 4 nights a week from about 9pm until as late as 4am sometimes.",

They then started doing it on purpose, I believe, So I started going to the basement and would trip all their breakers. They eventually got tired of me turning off their coolers and freezers and became more aware of the late night music volume and would cut it off early.\nEventually the business succumbed to the chef being a douche-hole, and it folded after only a year.",

He was a lazy waste of space who was fine sponging off my dad. I get home realize I left my keys at home and ring the bell. The guy comes to the window to see who it is, now, right across from my dad's bedroom door is the call box. You can talk to the person and buzz them in from here. He walked past it to open a window and tell me to go around the back. \n\nI'd already had a really long day and was in no mood for his power trip BS. So I said \"no, just buzz me in. \" and he refused. So I leaned on the bell till my sister got home. She asks what's going on, through the call box, mind you. I relay the events so far and she calls me childish and says she'll buzz me in. POS tries to stop her and she says she's buzzing me in. \n\nI come in smiling like the cat that got the canary and go to watch TV. POS comes out and snatches the cord from the back of the TV then turns, slams door to my dad's room and precedes to watch tv. At this apartment the basement with all the fuses was locked, if your fuses blew you had to call landlord and they'd show up like an hour later. No tenants had a key. I was, by and large, a nosy kid who like to get into places I didn't belong, and had figured out you could open the basement with a butter knife if you knew the trick. So I went downstairs and turned off electricity to the entire apartment. We all sat in the dark till my dad got home.",

Either I was free to work on assignments in peace or enjoy my games or movies without roommates getting in the way.\n\nOne Saturday morning I woke to THUNDEROUS thumping hip hop music. I opened my door to see the guy across the hall had set his speakers in the doorway and blasted music outside.\n\nWell... if it's good enough for him, it's good enough for me. I took my boombox, loaded up my brand new cd, Slipknot Iowa, turned the volume to 11 and blasted my tunes out the door.\n\nAbout 2 minutes of the mismatched noise was enough and I heard the hip hop stop. I turned my music off as well and it never happened again.\n\nHonestly... he may have just thought no one else was in the apartments. I'm pretty sure he and I were the only ones in that particular building.\n\nWe never actually spoke but at one point we met while passing each other in the halls. He nodded at me, I nodded back and that was it for that whole story.",

Anyone ever hear a beagle bay along with a mini dachshund barking it\u2019s ear piercing bark and my rescue pup who I\u2019m sure is a mix of Doberman and husky? Its a racket and it sounds like I have a giant pack of dogs living here. Let it happen for only a day and the neighbors started correcting/bringing their dog inside.",

I waited until the moment she clocked in and pressed play on a 10 hour loop of baby shark at full volume. I'd only turn it off when my boyfriend would come home or the cops showed up. Fun fact: the cops won't do shit about a noise complaint that \"feels intentional\" when you respond with \"it felt pretty intentional when she started blasting music at midnight\" infact, they stop responding to noise complaints from that altogether. Day 2 was an 1.5 hours of babyshark and 3 hours of my spotify on repeat playlist. Cannibal Corpse, Bloodbath, Nile, various other  noisy af death metal bands. By noon she texted my bf \"okay, how do we fix this?\"",

            "comment": "Years ago my GF (now wife) lived in an older \u2018character\u2019 building with a douchebag landlord who was very slow to repair things, like the heat, which was very poor in the wintertime. I was over once and while cooking dinner for her I spilled some liquid down between the counter and fridge. When we pulled the fridge out to cleanup we found a small metal door in the wall that had been painted over.\n\nCuriosity got the best of me and I pried it open with a butter knife, and found it to be the breaker panel for our floor and the one above, with two twin breakers per suite clearly marked. The DLL lived on the floor above us which was the top floor, albeit at the other end of the hall. We shut off two of his four breakers because\u2026\u2026..well, because. We turned them all back on again after about an hour.\n\nBut we left the refrigerator slightly askew, so we could reach in and randomly turn his breakers off on a whim. Rarely did we leave him without power for more than a couple of hours, and never turned more than two off at once. We knew he lived alone, so it wasn\u2019t like we were endangering a baby or anything like that. We noted an electricians van was parked in front of the building several days in a row. Once when we were leaving together, we ran into DLL and he mentioned how he was experiencing these short term power outages, and the very expensive electrician he hired was unable to track down the cause.\n\nWe commiserated with him saying we knew how frustrating it was to have something broken and struggle to have it fixed, in our case the heat, and not to have it be resolved quickly. We left it at that, and walked away. But I think we had made our point. The heat was fixed later that week. We stopped messing with his breakers, mostly, on a Friday night after a couple of beverages we might randomly flick his breakers off just for the fun of it. Eventually when she moved out, we turned off all of his breakers, closed the door and pushed the fridge hard up against it.\n\nADDENDUM: I appreciate the awards although youse guys have a strange definition of *wholesome!*\n\nWe turned off his power when we left because even though he did have the heat fixed it in no way diminished his douchebaggery. He used to openly leer at my GF and indeed all the women in the building, making snide comments, etc. He clearly cherished his feeling of authority he held over the tenants.",

My Pops was about to tell him he was going to pay him for the water. \n\nWell my dad went to the store and the doggos got premium water. So yaaaay for the doggos. \n\n\nWell about 2 monthish later, the neighbor had a huge party. Super loud. We didn't care as our house was sound proof. My mum would get horrible headaches so my dad made the home sound proof as much as possible as he wanting her to have a safe place. \n\n\nWell their electricity went out. They knocked at our door, lol asked for some electricity (no money in hand) so they could turn on a lamp to clean their house and so people could find their keys (they had phones by the way, so stupid excuse). \n\n\nMy dad knew he wanted the electricity so they could continue with his party and my dad....with a smile....\"\ud83d\ude0f get your own\" SLAM! He closed the door on their face. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\nHahahahaha I love my Pops for that.",

I didn't have one... yet.  Neither did my next-door neighbors.\n\nThe mom worked long hours, so the kids were responsible for themselves.  They weren't bad kids, it was just annoying and I was feeling sleep-deprived and petty, having just had a baby and had a toddler at the same time.\n\nThey'd come home from school in the afternoon, and the first thing they did was turn on their stereo.  Now, I will ignore terrible music because some of my music choices can be questionable, but this was bad.  It was a rap cover of the Gilligan's Island theme, I kid you not.  And, I could still just grit my teeth until the song ended... but it never ended.  They'd play it on a loop.... over, and over, and over, and over, ad nauseum. Full volume, all doors and windows open.\n\nAfter talking to the mom and it did no good (oh, she scolded the kids, they just didn't listen to her), I set out to win this.  Whenever they'd turn that horrible song on, I'd let it play once, then I would play Ozzy -- Crazy Train. On a loop.  Full volume, windows and doors open.  It only took two times of doing this, and they got the message.  They'd play it once, and that was it. They'd find other stuff to play after that.\n\nAnd before y'all excoriate me, my son (the baby) was a weird infant.  He was an easy, and heavy sleeper, and you could set off a stick of dynamite near him, and he wouldn't stir. He'd wake up to eat every 1.5-2 hours, and he ate a lot. But I also had an active toddler and couldn't nap during the day.",

            "comment": "A year ago, I had a similar problem with an upstairs neighbour. They were on the top floor (3rd)  and I was on the 1st floor. They were still partying at 5 am and the police were too busy to deal with it.\n\nAt first, I tried to talk to them but they wouldn't answer the door. Through the door, I heard them laughing.\n\nNext I went to the fuse box on the ground level but it was locked by a padlock so initially gave up. I went back and realised I could get around the padlock by unscrewing the brackets. I flipped the switches and the partying stopped... for ten minutes. I guess I had hoped that was enough but it wasn't.\n\nSo I wrote an angry note saying that if they tried again, I would make their lives hell and took out all the top floor fuses. They stopped partying for about 2 hours until the nearest hardware store opened. I think the guests went to the an airport in a mini-van around 3 pm. I think they moved out a week later.",

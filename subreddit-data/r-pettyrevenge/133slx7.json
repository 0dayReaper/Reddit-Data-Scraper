    "postText": "This is my first post on r/pettyrevenge, I hope you enjoy this story. I was going to split this into 2 parts, but I decided against it [EDIT below]\n\n\nThe story began last week, when I quickly went into the local German grocery chain store (rhymes with 'Schm-ALDI', for the curious among you), to pick up a pork belly for dinner that night. I quickly take it to the register, thank the nice young lady who allowed me to go ahead of her in the queue, and wait for the customer ahead to finish paying for their groceries\n\n\nThis is where we meet our nemesis working the register, an employee I will refer to as CBF (Corporal B****Face, a name I am not proud of coming up with reflexively, but unfortunately apt). Think of your stereotypical mid-50s Karen, with the classic haircut/glasses/sour-lemon-pucker combo. Unfortunately, she would have the attitude to match\n\n\nCBF starts tapping the conveyor belt, with all the fury and force of a woman who has probably seen a divorce or three, and tells me I need to put the pork belly down before she can scan it\n\n\nMy plan was to just hand it to her, like a normal human being. Clearly, this was not part of CBF's internal programming as of this \ncurrent build. I was more confused than anything at this point, so I complied. Pork onto conveyor, you got it lady\n\n\nNow, I had not anticipated that CBF was so well-versed in the ways of the all-important checkout belt. She proceeded to try to lecture me on why it was very important to place the groceries on said conveyor belt. Something to do with the automatic sensors stopping it when there is an item, and what would happen if I didn't place my item there forthwith\n\n\nYou know how someone will explain something to you with a statement, pause for *juuust* long enough, and then re-explain it using different wording to get their point across in a condescending way? This is what happened for the next 5 sentences out of CBF's lemon-hole (not sure exactly what words she used, I kinda zoned in and out between sentence 3 and 4)\n\n\nOnce it was clear that CBF's well-rehearsed shower speech was complete, I had decided that this fish was not getting off the hook that easy. I clapped my hands together and excitedly asked \"Ooh, ooh, then what would happen?\"\n\n\nCBF, with all the disdain and authority that she could muster from her hairspray-affected lungs, retorted loudly and snarkily, \"**THENNNN, I WOULD SEND YOU TO THE BACK OF THE QU-**\"\n\n\n*-beeeeep-*\n\n\nThe deathly silence and stare that followed after I cut CBF off mid-screech, with the sound of the contactless payment going through, was something I will cherish for at least the next few weeks. It was beautiful\n\nIt was petty, and satisfying. But it wasn't over. CBF was *not* happy. She had one final attempt to try to exert her authority over me, the lowly customer in front of her. One last knockout punch, to put me firmly in my place. As she angrily handed me my receipt, she uttered through gritted teeth:\n\n\"Next time, place the items down like you are **told**\"\n\nI laughed a bit, saluted towards CBF, and replied with the title of this post. Thanked the young lady in line again for letting me ahead of her, and gave CBF a quizzical' ['People's Eyebrow'](https://media.tenor.com/1avFsia-nv4AAAAC/raise-eyebrow-huh.gif) before marching off like a good soldier. I didn't stick around for the response, because [cool guys don't look at explosions](https://youtu.be/Sqz5dbs5zmo)\n\n\nIn hindsight, it was very petty, and probably unnecessary. I just wanted to pork in peace. No need for her to be a dick about it. Still, you came here for some petty, so there you have it\n\n\n**TL/DR: Uppity Karen-type tried to assert her dominance at the supermarket. I... did not comply, and cut her off with some comic timing**\n\n[EDIT: I was gonna post a Part 2, but I realised that it was less petty revenge, and more unnecessary bad behaviour on both our parts. The short version is that CBF was still carrying on in the same way with other customers, the next time I was there. I explained the events of the above story to another cashier, within earshot, and confirmed that there was no conveyor belt policy. I took satisfaction in that, but there was no real revenge other than CBF looking like she ate a second lemon while overhearing it all, and stopping her behaviour\n\nThanks for all your feedback. Be nice to retail workers and service industry workers whenever you can, they get enough stress and abuse as it is]",

    "postText": "Years ago I worked at Home Depot in the paint department and we did color matches. At the tail end of a busy night someone comes in wanting a color match which is no problem at all. However this gentleman wanted a color match from a random home depot sign that was bolted into a metal counter. After I told him that there was no way for me to unbolt the sign to color match it he got pissy and said he would go to Lowe's because according to him they would do it there. My response was \"so your going to go to Lowe's to get a color match of a home depot sign thats bolted down inside of home depot?\". A few people in line laughed at him and he walked away pissy. I get a call from a coworker who overheard the customer telling someone on their cellphone that they would place a large order closer to our close time and not pick it up. 20 minutes later he places an order for like 40 gallons and requested specifically that they be made in 40 individual gallon buckets rather than eight 5 gallon buckets. I grabbed a few cases of paint but I didnt prepare any because as he promised he left without picking them up. Fastforward maybe 3 months later im in Lowes wasting time while my car gets fixed and I run into the same guy and it looks like he was the only person staffed in this big area of the store. I grabbed a shopping cart and started looking for items on the shelf without product. I made him follow me around and requested at least 2 cases of each item that was empty on the shelf. He had to get a ladder and a scanner and he was working up quite a sweat. I kept hearing him getting paged but he had to keep telling the people paging him that hes still with a customer. After maybe 2 hours my car was ready and I informed the employee that my car was ready and after doing the math Im going to get the supplies from Home Depot and advised him he could just put everything back and that id tell managment he gave me great service. He had to get another ladder and put everything back up in the overheads because I had him get me more items than would go on the shelves. Ran into the same guy at my job a few months later and immediately took my lunchbreak and informed managment under no circumstances could I assist him because I had personal issues with him outside of work.",

Plus, that way you'd add them standing around for at least a few minutes waiting for you to come back and the possibility of a coworker seeing them just standing there after having been paged multiple times, so they might even get into trouble when the \"customer\" never comes back. Sure, it's a longshot, and you won't be around to see it if it does happen, but it's a small price to pay. Unless you go back and then pretend like you've never seen the clerk before in front of a coworker. Actually, that might be a way to make it even better. \n\nSay you have to go to the restroom, track down another clerk to get help in that same aisle. When the first clerk wonders what's going on, say to the second clerk that you asked them for help and they told you they were busy so that's why the second clerk is there. Then just say you don't want to deal with the first clerk's drama and you'll go somewhere else for what you need.",

I  worked at paint at HD for almost 4 years but in my store there is a policy that if a customer orders a certain amount of paint (ex. 3 - 5 gallons), they need to pay first before we mix them. As for Will-calls we usually make them right away no matter how many paint they order since it's already been paid for but there was one time someone ordered more than 2 dozen gallons of paint (all different colors) then canceled all of them. Then we decided that even with will-calls, paint will only be made if they are being picked up by the customer to prevent wastage, I don't think they enforce any of this rule anymore though since I've left.",

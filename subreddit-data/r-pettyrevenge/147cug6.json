    "postText": "I lived in downtown Denver CO for a few years in a big tall building in the south side of the city, maybe 5 blocks from the capitol building. We had shared laundry and though there were 100+ residents, there were few issues with the laundry room. Enters new entitled move ins, who were rude to me in the laundry room (I had the last free washer). I made sure to come switch out my wash as soon it was done, but maybe missed the \u201cdone\u201d beep by 5mins. \n\nI come into the laundry room and my clean clothes were on the floor- sopping wet. This was a Saturday morning- so to act on my revenge I made sure to take the plug out of the washer they used, mid wash, causing the door to auto lock and remain locked, with no electrical component to unlock it until maintenance came in Monday and called a plumber. \n\nI kept the chord just in case I needed an extra one day.",

I immediately took out what was in the washer and threw the pile of his wet clothes in the middle of the dirty garage floor. \n\nThe same guy who would take my clothes out also would never empty his plate of food before putting it in the sink (I did the dishes most of the time). One day he had a whole plate of food in the sink. He was already at work so I went to his room door and flicked every piece of food off that plate into his room. Petty? For sure.\n\nThe other roomate always wore my clothes until I got a lock for my door. \n\nI don't miss having roomates",

First time anything happened was I had 4 loads in washers (I know, it was bad) and when I went to take them out a guy was trying to find where to put his loads. I immediately apologized and got them all out. No one was rude about it (also I came almost as soon as they'd finished). We have like 25 dryers that work so that wasn't an issue at least.",

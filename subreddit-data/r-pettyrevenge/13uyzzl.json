    "postText": "Back in the pre-cellphone/VHS tape era my friends and I were renting a house next door to Entitled Douchebags (EDs from here on). We were late 20\u2019s professionals just getting started in our careers. They were stereotypical college guys: lots of parties with music and drinking, but our house had good soundproofing and we had both their driveway and our driveway between us, so no big deal.\n\nThe problem happened when football season started. We were near the stadium and the EDs decided to make some extra money by selling parking spots. Not just in their driveway: in our driveway too.\n\nWe told them to stop doing that. They did it again. We put trash cans in the way. They moved them and did it again. We told them that if they didn\u2019t stop it we\u2019d have any cars in our driveway towed. Their justification was, \u201cbut you\u2019re not using the driveway!\u201d\n\nThey did it again.\n\nWe called a different tow company for each of the five cars that they had parked. The EDs freaked out and started pounding on our door. I reminded them that they had had been warned twice and had persistently sold something that didn\u2019t belong to them. I told the EDs that they could either pay the tow truck drivers for the call-out or deal with angry customers who had been towed and impounded.\n\nThe EDs paid the tow trucks. We\u2019re talking roughly a hundred dollars per car. Cash.\n\nThat night the EDs got very drunk. They spray painted our house and tore open a bunch of trash bags and dumped them on our porch.\n\nAs I\u2019d said, this was before ubiquitous cameras and security surveillance. But since we were kinda expecting trouble with the EDs, I had borrowed a video camera from work and hooked it up to a VHS recorder with an eight hour tape. None of them noticed the video camera that we had covering our the driveway and porch.\n\nThe EDs each got a misdemeanor charge of malicious destruction. Our landlord got the cleaning costs out of their landlord, who got it out of the EDs before terminating their lease.",

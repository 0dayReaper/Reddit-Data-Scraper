    "postText": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nGrowing up, my (28f) older brother was really mean to me, honestly downright cruel. He would lock me in dark closets, throw pee soaked underwear at me, throw toys at me, and scream at me. He was so violent my parents had to be professionally trained on how to safely restrain him, and he kicked through his door because they would have to lock him in it sometimes. Being three years younger and timid, I usually just took it or told our mom.\n\nWe moved to a new house when I was around 7 (he would have been 10). One day he just would not let up on me. Jump scaring me, choking me, shoving, I was so sick of it. So I did what any reasonably peeved and frightened younger sibling would do. I knew he would get worse if I told on him and got him in trouble, so I took a silver sharpie and wrote his name on the post for the basement steps.\nIn his handwriting. \n\nI did this another time with a pen on the white wall upstairs. My parents never believed him until I recalled the story a few years ago.\n\nNow, before you go and hate on him, he had trauma and severe bipolar that manifested early, to the point where he would have hallucinations. I was also being abxsed at daycare at the time so I was really timid and didn't want to rock the boat. Once the truth about our earlier trauma came out, he got the help he needed. We ended up having a decent relationship when I was in high school, which has since fallen to the wayside due to other (new) trauma issues. \n\nTL; DR: my brother was really mean to me as a kid so I wrote his name on the walls in his handwriting and got him in trouble.",

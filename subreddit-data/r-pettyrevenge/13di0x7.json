    "postText": "Back in 7th grade I was in \"Resource Room\" as it was called with a super abusive teacher. I am not the hero in this story but my friend who was in 8th grade was. \n\nWe will call him T. And the Teacher Mrs.B\n\n\nSo Mrs.B had a habit of keeping us from things such as recess, bathroom breaks, things by law we were supposed to have. However she felt that instead of us having developmental disabilities she decided to be abusive. \n\nFor example I almost wet myself once because she denied bathroom breaks because we weren't told we had homework and she decided to revoke that \"privilege\" and so for 2 hours I had to hold it until lunch. \n\nMrs. B kept mispronouncing Ts name and attacked T frequently because she didn't understand WE HAVE FUCKING DISABILITIES or something. She treated T frequently as if he was stupid and lazy. \n\nT had enough so one day he stole the answer key mathbook. Had all the answers and formulas so T finished his work and turned it in to Mrs.B T went back and she came up. \"T I saw that you cheated and you need to give me the book!\"  T gave off a loud \"No!\" and sat on the book. Mrs.B raged \"T GIVE ME THE BOOK BACK OR ELSE!\" T \"NO!\"  \n\nMrs.B yelled \"T FINAL WARNING GIVE ME THE BOOK!\" \n\nT then cut a nice loud fart on the book and we busted out laughing as Mrs.B looked on in horror. \"Here's your book back!\" \n\n\n\nMrs.B yelled at T to go to the office. T left with a \"FUCK YOU!\" as she called \"I want you to call T's mom RIGHT NOW I WANT HIM EXPELLED!\" \n\nShe told us to keep at our mathwork as she yelled at T, T then took off on foot to meet his mom who picked him up. \n\nT's mom found out Mrs.B was abusing us so T and Mrs.B both got suspended though T had a shorter time. T was removed from the program but placed into general Ed with IEP (Individualized Educational Plan) exceptions.\n\n\nApparently Mrs.B demanded T pay for a brand new book. Principal being a Chad, took a wipe, wiped off the book, and informed her that she can't be abusive to us.\n\n\nEdit: this was almost 20 years ago.",

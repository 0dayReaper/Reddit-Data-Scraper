    "postText": "A few years ago I worked sales and was calling leads (people that voluntarily inquired on our site, not cold calls). I called a lead, Robert, and he answered and screamed at me \u201cWHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN CALL MY HOME?! YOU PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE!! HOW DARE YOU? I AM AN AUTHOR AND YOU ARE DISTURBING ME!\u201d\u2026\u2026 on and on. I apologized profusely a hung up. He sent an email reaming me out- same shit. I cried in the bathroom. \n\nI decided to look him up and found all his books on Amazon. I gave it a few months, but went onto my dads account and gave a 1 star review on all his books.\n\nEdit: 1. Some people are upset on behalf of my dad that I used his account and A) all I did was make him look like he didn\u2019t like a few books B) he knows and thinks it\u2019s funny\n\n2. Some are pointing out that I\u2019m a softy for crying in the bathroom and to that I say yes- I am. \n\n3. You can review books on Amazon even if you haven\u2019t purchased it. Idk ask jeff I don\u2019t make the rules",

Well, I told the sales person I was busy just then (putting together a swing set) and the sales person yelled at me because I asked for the call (so i guess i should have been sitting on my hands waiting for it). Never signed up for another call from anyone again.",

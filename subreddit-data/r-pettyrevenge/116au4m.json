    "postText": "Important info - we decided to have a micro wedding, with just our immediate family there, around 10 people. We got married at a venue that is known for holding very large events, but we hired a smaller room there. \n\nMy husband has a child with his ex, so sees her quite often for things related to my step kid. We were always planning on inviting her to the wedding to see their kid all dressed up and to generally keep a good coparenting relationship. Before we had invited her, she informed DH that she'd be there, and asked when and where it was. He was a little taken aback but as we were planning on inviting her anyway he just told her.\n\nOn the day, she showed up to our morning ceremony wearing the shortest dress I've ever seen, over stockings and suspenders (the suspenders could be seen for a good 6 inches before the bottom of the dress), skyscraper heels, nightclub makeup, and costume jewellery. My father actually pulled me aside to ask \"who hired a stripper?!\".\n\nI found out afterwards from mutual friends that she had texted all of them asking when they were getting there - because she had invited herself we hadn't thought to let her know it was such a small ceremony - and when they let her know it was family only and the reception was completely separate she began to panic a little.\n\nAnd I had the best petty revenge. I asked everyone to be EXTRA nice to her. Every time she tried to sneak away someone would engage her in conversation. She was extremely uncomfortable, and ended up sitting down with her coat covering her. The wedding went off without a hitch.\n\nI'm not sure what she expected to happen, but it all worked out fine in the end \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

My mom drove me there so I wouldn't have to drive myself home. \n\nAbout a block from the restaurant we were talking about how downtown had hit a rough patch in its redevelopment and we then pass a tall woman wearing a **very** short leather skirt, 4\" stilettos, and a barely there top. The skirt was barely legal and a strong wind might have gotten her arrested. \n\nMy sister immediately said,\" Oh look, a hooker!\" I glance over and say, \" No, that's just my friend Kathleen.\" All three of us cracked up over the mistake. \n\nObvi we never told Kathleen about it, and I haven't seen her in years. But \"No, that's just Kathleen\" is still a catchphrase and go to joke between hubby and I. \n\nGood job handling the ex with class, OP. I can't imagine how mortified she must have been!",

I have a feeling her plan or idea was that she\u2019d waltz in, in her trashy hooker ensemble (and a cheap street hooker at that, not a high end hotel escort) and all eyes \ud83d\udc40 would go to her, with the men gasping in wonder at her sexiness, and the women all giving her the stink-eye as she charmed the men, as they surrounded her hoping for a moment of attention from this incredibly beautiful sexy woman. \n\nEx (groom) would be stunned speechless and immediately be deeply regretful he is marrying some dowdy, wife-y type dullard, instead of this beautiful, amazingly sexy, woman he let slip through his fingers. He will see how all the males flock around her, all vying for even the smallest attention from this mysterious stranger (except friends and family of course - they all know she\u2019s a POS). Perhaps he even leaves the bride at the altar whilst he hops in a car with the runaway bride, and speeds off ala The Graduate (movie for the kids here). \n\nRemember, this is HER fantasy of how it would play out. I would have paid cash to see her face when she walked into a tiny venue with only a few friends and family in attendance, in that ho outfit. The staring would not be admiring, but be the obvious side-eye everyone gives her, while talking about her among themselves in a not-flattering way. \n\nIf you are an ex and a baby mama, and you are attending the father of your child\u2019s wedding, low key wins the day. Not trying to upstage the bride, or trying to fuck all the wedding party males to make ex jealous. This is where class meets trash. You want to be the \u201cclass\u201d example",

So everyone was just so overly kind and \"bless his heart\" and \"thank you for your service.\" The guy was a miserable and bitter old man, with some trophy wife dressed like the OP describes. Thankfully, he left the ceremony early, and only attended the reception standing, shaking a few hands, and leaving quickly.\n\nYears and years later, I found out that the groom's father was not injured in any war, and in fact was only in the Navy for 4 years during peacetime before he got discharged due to inability to be promoted. He loathed people bringing up his military service. The truth was, the groom's dad was an insufferable asshole, and someone in the wedding party decided to put this \"spin\" on his back story so nobody would pay any attention to his outbursts or his general assholishness. If nobody paid attention to him and seemed awkward around him, his desire to stir up trouble and start fights was completely nerfed. Once he realized he was not the center of attention he wanted to be, he quickly left.",

I guess no one ever bothered to tell her beautiful comes from within. Beauty isn't a short skirt and too much makeup.\n\nI guess she forgot he left her for a reason and it had nothing to do with her looks or her clothes.\n\nI love the revenge. My step kids finally got around to telling their mom to quit that shit. Of course this was after they were grown.\n\nETA: spelling and also to add I didn't mean anything insulting to OP. I'm sure OP is beautiful.",

He grabbed his stuff, and tried to leave, she asked for a hug, he said no and left.     \nHasn\u2019t talked to her since. But she did try sending him a message once we were together saying she loved him, even though she never said it to him when they were together.       \nIdk what she expected with the corset either.",

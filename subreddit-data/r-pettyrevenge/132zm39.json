    "postText": "I got my very first apartment at the ripe age of 26. I was fortunate enough to be able to afford one without roommates. I was a model tenant: paid my rent on time every month, polite to the office workers, never caused trouble. I lived on the top floor of a 3 story building.\n\nWell, 2 years after I moved in, I had new neighbors move into the apartment below me. I was working a swing shift so my hours were 3pm-11pm, and I often stayed up late to 3am to do minor chores: dishes, cooking, cleaning (but not vacuuming). I also had two cats at the time.\n\nMy new neighbors immediately went on the war path against me. I could not make any noise without them banging on my floor. I unloaded my dishwasher at 11am on a Sunday and they flipped out. They complained to the office about my \"herd of animals\". They sent police to my door at 9pm because I was watching tv (at a reasonable volume with the subtitles on.) I literally could not make any sound without them complaining. It culminated in one of them pounding on my door for 10 minutes after I dared call the office to express my frustration. \n\nSo I called the office back. Told them that I did not feel safe in my apartment due to my neighbors actions (legal grounds for me to break my lease). But then I dropped my bombshell. My neighbors had 4 people in a 1 bedroom apartment that had a 2 person max capacity.\n\nApartment management told my neighbors they had to move into a more expensive 2 bedroom apartment or their lease would be terminated. They moved to the larger apartment on the other side of the complex.\n\nMy new neighbors were great. 2 adult men who smoked weed on the balcony. Never even spoke to them. Loved 'em.",

If they cause no trouble other than occasional weed smell on the balcony you\u2019re less likely to complain about the balcony. \n\nI was like that with Mexican neighbors. They threw massive 150+ people parties that got as loud as you\u2019d expect. I\u2019d wake up to a beer on the porch at minimum for not calling cops.",

The intent of this comment is just to show that every culture has its own way of showing hospitality to its neighbors. In this case, I was talking about the kind of hospitality a good neighbor that happens to be Mexican shows or at least has always shown me. I am not implying anything beyond that.",

You would think they wouldn't want more attention, but no, they treat all their actions the same, try to get away with it if they can on multiple fronts, until they get enough attention on themselves and get arrested or shut down.\n\nUsually see that with parking, driving, being a jerk to neighbors etc, those people are also the same trying to take advantage of things at work. I honestly thought it would be the opposite, you try to get away with one thing and keep a low profile elsewhere, but they are very much related.",

Especially from 7am-10pm, unless they're literally dropping bowling balls, really any noise that comes from living a normal life is not your problem and the downstairs neighbor needs to just deal with it. But at night, I will tell you from experience, it's impossible to sleep when your neighbor is walking around at 2am. When you're in a mostly silent room and you get woken up, every single noise after that will prevent most people from falling back asleep, and it's incredibly frustrating, laying there while someone walks around for hours. There are ways to be a good neighbor both a the person on the upper floor and the person on the bottom floor. Just deal with noise during the day and be as quiet as humanly possible at night.",

They also rode their big wheels all around the house.  I tried asking them to keep the noise down to no avail.  Anyway, I let my landlord know I would be moving because I could no longer live in that kind of hell.  Well, it turns out he rented the apartment to a couple, no mention of 4 kids.  Their living arrangement was actually in violation of local housing ordinances.  So, the landlord kicked the family out and rented to a single lady who I never even heard a peep out of.",

Most of us were young bachelor's and it was not uncommon for a ranking to be placed on your mailbox in the morning if you had, shall we say... Given a good performance the night before... lol. So after about a year old man moves in below me. This guy would call the cops on me for playing music he didn't like at noon. More than once called the cops complaining about domestic violence because of a movie, TV show, or someone giving a late night performance. Well this was a pet free apartment (often broken by cats, birds, reptiles) old man had a small yap yap dog that would bark at 6am to go out like clockwork. I had a cat who the maintenance guy loved (I became good friends with maintenance guy) .  Old man calls the apartment office complains about my cat.  Maintenance guy tips me off and I take cat with me for the day. I literally would have never said anything about his dog, but he tried to get me evicted. So I set my alarm early one morning, and borrowed a camcorder from work. Sure enough dog barks at six, he opens his slider and takes dog out.. In only his robe, nothing else on. Sure enough a few days later he's moving out, given an indecent exposure, and basically balling his eyes out.  Never told him it was me but everyone else knew.",

Not that she was a bad person or anything like that, but when you have social anxiety and the only way to get your car is by engaging in a 5-20 minute conversation each time, you pray for harsh winter days that are so cold she can\u2019t sit outside.

Very often I could hear constant banging on the wall for 20 minutes at a time. I honestly think the kids were kicking their feet on the wall for fun. I was outside one time and one of her kids (probably 7 years old) had a monster energy drink in their hand, happily sipping away\ud83d\udc80. What mother gives their 7 year old a monster? Was relieved when they moved out. Now it\u2019s a middle aged couple who make no noise at all.",

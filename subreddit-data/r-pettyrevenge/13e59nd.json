    "postText": "Back when I was around 9 or 10 years old, I was riding my bicycle up and down the road of our neighborhood. We lived in a rural area, and our neighborhood was a single seal coat road that was about a quarter mile long with houses on both sides from beginning to end. That summer most of my friends went away to summer camp, so I had to amuse myself. My Dad didn't think summer camp, or boy scouts, or any of those things were worth the money. \n\nMost neighbors were pretty chill but one guy who had recently moved in was kind of a dick. He was married but had no kids. He did have a dog, though. It was a collie and it didn't like kids. \n\nAs I was riding past the guys house for like the fifth time, that dog comes running out to the road and snapped at my leg, it lay open a good sized bite mark and I fell over into gravel. The guy was out in the yard, called his dog back, and ignored me when I said his dog had bit me. I picked up my bike, rode home with blood streaming down my leg. At home, I told both my parents what had happened, including about the guy ignoring me. My Mom washed out the wound, wrapped it in gauze while my Dad fumed, asking me over and over exactly how it happened. Once I was bandaged up, my Dad told me to get in the truck. My Mom asked if he was taking me to the doctor. My Dad just snarled something unintelligible and led me to his truck. Instead of heading to town, he drove into the neighborhood, since our house was the first one closest to the main two lane blacktop that led into the nearest town.\n\nHe went where I figured he was going, to that guy's house. He pulled into the guy's driveway and told me to stay in the truck. I saw how mad my Dad was, and obeyed him.\n\nI heard my Dad knock on the guy's front door. I heard the door open and the guy say \"Yes, can I help you?\" \n\nMy Dad told the guy his dog had bitten me. They guy asked my Dad if he had proof. My Dad told him about the gash on my leg, and that I knew better than to lie to him. \n\nThe guy started arguing with my Dad. Bad move on his part. My Dad swore at the guy. It was the first time I ever heard my Dad use the word 'motherfucker.' The guy got cocky, and then I heard the sound of a fist hitting flesh. The man started shrieking like a woman. My Dad told him, in a very loud voice, that if there was any more trouble with the guy's dog and any kid in the neighborhood, he would be back and there would be Hell to pay. \n\nThen my Dad got in the truck, drove back to our house, picked up my Mom, and they took me to the family doctor to have the wound treated. There was proof that the dog had its' shots, so no rabies tests or shots needed. From that day forward I never saw that dog running loose.\n\n My Dad had a reputation as a brawler most of his life, having spent his youth in bars and he was the sort of guy to never back down from a fight. He was only 5'8\" and 165 lbs, but he was mean as fuck when he was drunk. He was nobody to piss off when he was sober, either.\n\nEven in his late 40s, he was still a fierce bastard if anyone fucked with him. I once saw him drop a guy that was over 6 feet tall, and it was only two hits, my Dad hitting him, and the guy hitting the floor.\n\nMy Dad died young, in his 50s, but I knew to never talk back to him. One of my older brothers made that mistake, once.  \n\nAnd the guy with the dog? He moved out after selling his house a couple years later and I never saw him again.",

That's so far out of norm for those dogs I can't imagine how the owner must have raised it. We got a scotch collie because we live by an elementary and they are really really kid-proof dogs. If a kid kicks a ball in our yard and goes to get it, neither dog (the other is an aussie/lab we think) would go after the kid. Might leave the yard to see the other kids too but that's it.  Collies should never, ever bite a kid :(",

She won't give y'all any issues.\"  /s/ Sure. /s/) actually got ahold of her, otherwise it was snaps and growled warnings &amp; such.  We had to muzzle more than half of the borders we groomed because of snappishness over specific body-part touching or just general attitude.  The only other dogs who got muzzled were the chows and one poodle.\n\nI love animals, but I'm glad I don't work for a groomer anymore.",

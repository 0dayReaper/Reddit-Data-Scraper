    "postText": "A few years ago I resigned from my job and was moving interstate and preparing to pursue further education.  \n\nUnfortunately I had difficulty selling my condo and was gradually exhausting all my savings and emergency extra funds over the time it took to sell.  After a while, it got to the point where I had to liquidate many of the things I own to not only stay afloat but also prepare for my move.  I consequently fell behind on my 80$ per month condo fees but figured once it sold the notary would make the necessary adjustments anyhow and all would be finalized, paid and okay.  I wasn\u2019t in a position to pay those fees at the time and I hadn\u2019t received any notification about it.  I felt I was very close to selling.  I wasn\u2019t receiving any other income however.  \n\nEventually I sold my piano to get some money and a moving truck came over to pick it up and deliver it to the new buyers.  My neighbour downstairs thought I was skipping town when he saw the piano movers taking my piano and saw it as an opportunity to confront me.  \n\nI left my front door partially open during the piano move and the neighbour downstairs came right into my place screaming at me about \u201cskipping town\u201d and not paying the condo fees.  I was surprised he knew.  He was a retired, stocky man and was fuming at me right inside my living room, well inside my condo.  I asked him to leave and he refused to leave.  Fearing I would lose control with a senior, I called the police, left the condo with him inside and waited outside to cool off.  The police arrived and I informed them what he did and where he was and left to a meeting that morning.  \n\nI knew the police had warned him about trespassing and I knew he\u2019d never be back again so I spent the next week (or so) exacting my petty revenge over the intrusion into my home.  \n\nFirst of all I gleefully spent hours signing him up to receive all sorts of junk mail and phone calls from coffin catalogues to women\u2019s make-up, sample adult diapers, anti-diarrhoea samples, Avon products, timeshare-  you name it.  I unleashed all my creative juices and went to it.  If I could find it online and if it was free- I would have them send it or contact him.  He would\u2019ve been contacted by phone, by mail and by email from many many different places over the next few weeks at least. \n\nSecondly, I turned into an elephant in my condo.  I would lift up the furniture (during daylight of course) and drop it heavily on the ground several times so he\u2019d hear it.  He couldn\u2019t come up so he had to bear it.\n\nLong story short I let it all out over that time and sold my place, paid the outstanding condo fees in full and left.",

    "postText": "Long story short, our neighbors suck. They've disturbed the neighborhood doing things that are borederline illegal to straight up illegal. \n\nBut this is less serious---as a new-ish birder, and having a large yard, I enjoy the birds that stop by on my pine trees and oak trees. I enjoy looking at them from a birding scope. I don't have any feeders. \nWe have stray cats in the neighborhood, and I tend to keep them out of my yard. Strays surplus kill and will obviously kill birds in the yard even when not hungry. They also would use the yard as a litter box before I kept them out. \n\nWell, two weeks ago I found a little cat food container on my property (close to the boarder of my neighbors). They don't have a cat--in fact, they left their cat in their house that they lit ablaze for insurance money (and I was the one who rescued the kitty-he found a proper home). \n\nIt could have somehow been trash left on my yard sure, but it was a little too peculiar. Whether it was my neighbor's or not, given the above I wouldn't put it past them. They fail to take care of their own animals but buy/want more. They've been a nuisance enough--so I made a natural cat-alarm system that makes sure all the strays my neighbors 'have' don't cross my yard (along with other deterrents). How? \n\nI want to enjoy my birds--so i used birds. I've used territorial crows that have visited my yard to chase out and divebomb stray cats. These crows scout the area constantly everyday, and if you know,-- they're smart af. I give them treats as a reward for staying fairly close to the yard. The crows have learned to only chase them out of my yard and make a bunch of noise by these neighbors only. They are pretty quiet otherwise (minus when they see a cat, hence the alarm).\n\nHaven't had a stray enter my yard since, and haven't seen a food container since. Could I have talked to them? Sure, but I prefer the petty route with them. I love these crows--should train them to divebomb the neighbors next (I won't haha)..",

If they cross at night that's fine as long as they don't dig up the yard. The song birds I like aren't active at night either so I'm a bit more chill with the felines. What helps keep them at bay for a bit if the crows are gone is that I have a few contained mint plants at the corners of my yard now. I say contained because mint can grow quickly. The cats don't really like it so they don't go there anymore. \n\nThe crows are like extra reinforcement during the day  (and early morning-- I'll hear them at 5am).",

But the idea spawned when I observed a few interactions with the cats crossing my yard and the crows (two in particular) who didn't want any part of it. \n\nThe crows literally would swoop down from whatever high branch they were on to nearly collide with the cats mid flight. I usually ignored the battles beforehand and continued to mull about how I was getting the 'neighbors stays' out my yard after last week.  Remembering this behavior from the crows a few times, I decided to put peanuts out for them.  \n\nThey would've chased cats anyway since they have an axe to grind with all them apparently, but the idea was more so to keep them closer to this yard. The crows made an association pretty quick and began staying here longer than other yards and patrolling my yard nearly every hour (they're silent when doing it unless they see a cat). These birds are always watching, and they've also made an association to me as the friendly peanut lady who also chased out cats (I just wave around a gardening tool or something and they see that). It's been 9 days and they are comfortable being around when I am around. I think I saw a study where it said crows recognize faces or something like that.\n\nThis is definitely an ongoing experiment. The crows are here to stay though.",

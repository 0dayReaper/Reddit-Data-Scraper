    "postText": "So I rent a house with my husband and two of our friends, it\u2019s a 5 bedroom house. Rent is outrageous in our area, $2400 for a 1 bedroom apartment. So we found this house for $3000, not a bad deal while we save up to buy a house. \n\nThere are other houses in the neighborhood like this as well our next-door neighbors their house is a five bedroom house and they have nine people living in their house\u2026 so it is chaos over there all the time. In our neighborhood we can choose the trash company so it just so happens that we have the same trash company as the next-door neighbors. Our trash company does like us to have the trash out by 7 AM, we don\u2019t always get it out that earlier though and that\u2019s where this problem started. Most of the time they don\u2019t pick up our trash until 11 AM so obviously, as long as the trash is out before trash pick up gets here, they can take our trash. \n\nThe people next-door have three trash cans, and they are overflowing every single week. They put their trash out the night before but unfortunately our neighborhood has raccoons and foxes so the trash is always getting into and last time a raccoon got into their trash, it left a mess in our yard and they wouldn\u2019t pick it up. I was pretty pissed about it but I just let it go cleaned up their trash. I did go and put it back in their trashcan and they just sat out front glaring at me while I did that. \n\nHere is where this incident started, a couple weeks ago, I didn\u2019t get our trash out until almost 9 AM. All four of us was sick with Covid, I was on the mend and feeling a little bit better but I slept in and forgot to put out the trash at 7 AM. So I go to put the trash out and my neighbor starts yelling at me saying you were supposed to have your trash out by 7 AM you can\u2019t put your trash out now, I said well they haven\u2019t come and pick up the trash because your trash cans are full so it\u2019s not a big deal, he said no that\u2019s the rules, your trash has to be out by 7 AM, if it\u2019s not you can\u2019t get your trash picked up this week. I said I understand that they want the trash out by 7 AM but they haven\u2019t come and picked it up yet so it doesn\u2019t matter, so I went ahead and I just walked inside. \n\nI went back to bed and a couple hours later I get up to see that our trash can were put to the side of the house and they were still full of trash. So that means that someone moved our trashcan. Our other neighbor came up to me the next day and said that she saw him put our trash can back. She didn\u2019t know the situation so she wasn\u2019t going to but in and tell him to not do that. Our neighbors are also very proud about their last name. They literally have a flag in their front window with their last name so I called the trash company and I said that I was Mrs.Soandso and I needed to set up a vacation hold for our upcoming pick up. They said no problem we won\u2019t pick up your trash next week. They legit only asked for the address, no other information\u2026 The next week I made sure that our trash was out at 6:45 AM then I sat and I watched for the trash truck and I watched them come past the house. They drove past my neighbors house didn\u2019t pick up their trash, even though their trash was overflowing, picked up ours and the other few people who also have them and left. I know I\u2019m an asshole for doing this, you don\u2019t need to tell me, I may have crossed the line. But he also crossed the line by touching our cans and moving them and setting foot on our property.\n\n**editing to add** our lease it up at the end of this month, so we won\u2019t be dealing with these crazies for much longer. And if they mess with the house, GOOD. My slumlord can deal with it!",

No danger to a human normally, as where I live the garbage trucks have an arm that pick up the bins and dump them, so no people outside the vehicle.\n\nAnyways I get home and I can see there's some little chicken bones and a bit of glass where the trash can was before I left for work.\n\nIt fell over sideways, **everything** must have spilt out and they picked in all up, placed it back in the bin and then wheeled it into the corner of our gate so it wouldn't get knocked over by the wind again. \n\nI had had such a bad day.

Come back home in the evening and get out of your car, hope you don\u2019t end up stepping on dog crap because the dog would poop literally right there where the car doors would open up. He got 1 fine. Then he thought he\u2019d be slick and get a spot off camera. But you could still see the dog walk up there. I took a picture of the poop and of him letting the dog go there. Guess that was enough for the HOA to send a fine because he never tried it again. I still don\u2019t know what the guys problem was.

My trash story:\n\n I was manager of a small apartment building (9 units), and my tenants would come to me repeatedly complaining that their trash cans were being filled by someone else. Each tenant had their own trash can in a communal shed beside the alley at the rear of the building. After a bit of sleuthing I discovered our neighbor across the alley was filling our trash cans with his stuff... leaves, branches and even his own household garbage. He would put a little into all nine of our trash cans, I suppose to avoid filling one completely. Anyways, once I found out what was going on I waited until all nine of our trash cans were full, and dumped each and every one of them into a neat pile in his garage. Problem solved.",

Neighbors 3 houses down the block (lived on a hill so town sanitation truck came down my street since it was the only direct street leading to the next through street) would have their garbage out at 6 on Friday mornings.  No problem, it was picked up.  Problem was that they then put out more garbage Friday night or Saturday morning and let it sit there till Tuesday morning.  It took months of me and fellow neighbors complaining till they stopped.  Told the cops they didn't like the garbage cans full in their back yard!  Cops told them the neighborhood didn't like looking at their overflowing cans all weekend.  \n\nThey stopped for a year and then started again.  Cops came and wrote them up.  When it came time for court, boy were they surprised.  They were a corner house, neighbors showed up from opposite corners and at least 6 other houses (myself included) when they asked for names of who complained. Judge whacked with a heavy fine and told them nothing goes to the curb until 6 the morning of pickup only.  Rest of the time garbage cans are in your side or back yard only.",

As long as it's there before the truck gets there I don't see the difference.  You would think they want it out the least amount of time possible.  It makes more sense to have a \"you can't put the trash out BEFORE such and such time\" than an AFTER specific time rule.  That's what my neighborhood does, you have to put the trash out after a certain time the day before and remove it by a certain time the next day.",

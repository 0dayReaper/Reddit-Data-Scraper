    "postText": "Yesterday I posted an account of when I worked at a high end resort hotel in the 70\u2019s with a part timer who we\u2019ll call Bill, and how he wrote the word \u201cfucking\u201d on a postcard, etc.\n\nI was debating posting this more malicious act of petty revenge involving a complete jackass.  It\u2019s probably illegal what Bill did.\n\nWe just started second shift on a Friday when this guy arrived to check in. He wanted joining rooms. Our hotel, believe it or not, did not have joining rooms. He raised his voice and said it was unacceptable. Bill chimed in that he was free to find another hotel more accommodating. \n\nThis set him off. He called Bill an idiot. After the dust cleared and he eventually checked in Bill was his usual laid back self. \n\nAbout an hour later, close to five, this dickwad comes down and tells Bill to make him an 8PM dinner reservation at what was the swankiest restaurant in the area. Bill told him he doubted he could because they are booked weeks ahead for the weekend. Well, dickwad reacted by telling Bill he was a fuckup.\nBill smiled and said nothing. \n\nAfter work we stopped off for a beer at a local lounge. Suddenly on the bar TV a commercial came on for these Bible tapes. The whole Bible on cassettes. Not cheap either. I saw Bill write the number down. I couldn\u2019t figure out what he was up to.\nBill then asked me if I wanted to mess with that dickwad. Sure! \nHe pulled out a xerox of the guy\u2019s folio with his Amex card imprint along with the idiots address and grinned. He motioned I follow. \n\nWe went to one of the pay phones near the entrance. Back then you could make 1-800 calls on pay phones free. Bill called the Bible tapes number and ordered TWO sets to be sent to the dickwad and used the dickwad\u2019s credit card. \n\nI was stunned and yet impressed. Bill told me he would have a hell of a time straightening this out. Next weekend when I again worked with Bill he said he hoped the dickwad enjoys all the crap he bought that week. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure it was illegal, and I\u2019m sure Bill had done that before. \n\nI learned a lesson. Never piss off anyone who can get you back.",

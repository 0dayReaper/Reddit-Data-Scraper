    "postText": "Originally posted this in ProRevenge but was told this more fit the petty nature so posting it here as well. \n\nHigh school was weird for me. On the one hand, I was a part of all the sports teams except hockey and hung with the popular folks. On the other hand, I was fat and was the comedic relief for almost everything. Mr punchline. Either the one delivering the roast or getting roasted. My weight usually was the main point. Quick enough to always say something funny back or roast someone, but was always conscious that I wasn't in the group because I was the \"Cool guy\" which tempered my responses from being too rough. Still, I thought that I had built some friendships. My mistake.\n\nOne day after football practice a few of my teammates and at the time my best friend, lets call him Jake, were talking about some rumours that were circling around from a party that they went to that weekend. Never mind I wasn't invited, but let's just say two people in relationships were caught in a room doing relationship things by the people they were in relationships with. Juicy story but throughout the space of the conversation relationships in general came up and I had explained that I was still a virgin and had yet to even have a high school girlfriend. Queue them stating they needed to set me up and that they were not going to let my \"Life be loveless\".\n\nI didn't really think much of the conversation because I was basically an afterthought, so when one of the girls in the popular group, let's call her Sarah, started to talk to me I didn't put 2 and 2 together. Sarah started to hang with me at lunch, even separating from the larger group to do as such. We bonded over our love for Gossip Girl, which will become important later, and our disdain for horror films. This went on for a few weeks, so when she invited me to her house after school I thought all the obvious thoughts. The walk was cool but Sarah was a lot more quiet than normal. I remember me thinking she was just nervous. When we got to her house she had asked me to wait at the entrance to her basement while she made sure her house was clear. I complied and sat at the stone stairs. And sat and sat. I think I waited for 1 hour in ignorance before I realized anything was wrong. This was 10 years ago so that 1 hour was a true 1 hour. My little Blackberry phone was drier than dry and my parents were not about to pay for anything but talk and text. I tried calling her but got no response. Even still I waited maybe 20 minutes more before I left. I remember thinking maybe her parents just grounded her or something happened, but the next day at school I would be able to ask her.\n\nWell, the next day happened, and I was getting more looks than I normally would. Snickers here and there made me more self-conscious than anything again assuming it was about my weight. It wasn't until lunch that another friend, let's call him Rashaad, pulled me to the side and showed me a Facebook group I never knew existed. In it were multiple videos of me sitting on the stairs over the course of that 1 hour and 20 minutes, putting on lip balm, picking my nose, and doing a pit check. Snickers and jokes could be heard as Jake, my friend and teammate was making fun of my every move and how could I think that Sarah would be interested in me? Rashaad said it wasn't funny and showed me the comments but I was basically dead inside at that point. I didn't even go to confront Jake and Sarah, I just bumped into them at my locker where Jake said it was a harmless prank and that they expected me to leave much sooner than they did. By the end of the day I was the butt of every joke and other than Rashaad nobody came to my defence.\n\nI was lucky enough to make it home before I just started balling my eyes out with how much it hurt. Eventually, that sadness became bitterness and anger. I needed to get back at not just Jake and Sarah but everyone who continuously used me as the joke, I just didn't know how to do it. Funny enough I had rented the whole 6 seasons of gossip girl from the library and in the middle of watching it I came up with a plan. I took a pen and paper and wrote down every single piece of gossip I knew, and I knew plenty. Being a fly on the wall in popular groups you would be amazed how loud secrets could be told, and how many didn't know who was listening.\n\n2 weeks later the \"Shittalker\" Twitter post went live with Jake being the center focus. He was getting tested for an STD not many people knew about, and that he definitely didnt want to be public knowledge. The football star had been around and when that went live chaos ensued. It only took his absence and a few girls conversations and now it was confirmed. He came back a few days later and when he was getting those same looks I had gotten with him being the butt of the joke. I loved every second of it. He went on a warpath trying to find out who the Twitter page belonged to, but because only a few \"knew\" about it he never assumed me. A few days later and a few more posts and the \"Shittalker\" was the talk of the school. Pregnancy, Infidelity, you name it. If it was gossip and would get a reaction it was up. Don't know if everything ended up being true but a good majority the people in the know could confirm themselves. It had even leaked into other schools and whole cities apart where copycats for other schools popped up. Nobody trusted nobody for a while and instead of jokes made about me the focus was the gossip and the dirt people were doing or apart of.\n\nEventually, the gossip ran out and it became a roasting page before it was taken down for bullying, but for maybe about a month that page was the only thing high schoolers in my area wanted to talk about. All because a fat kid was joked on.",

This is confusing to many Americans as its equivalent here is the opposite, a Private School (long story that doesn't make much sense).\n\nThe school was literally about 400 years old. We had pranks, japes, merriments, tomfoolery, jiggery-pokery, pigerry-jokery, and all kinds of creative stuff going on. Seldom a dull moment. Plus the old part of the school looked like freaking Hogwarts.\n\nBut in all the time I was there, I never saw a single case of systematic bullying, in the way I hear in these posts. We always had, or became, a Rashaad, who said, OK, let's dial it all back a bit, shall we?\".\n\nEveryone got their fair share of good-natured shit, but just  piling it on was just third rate assholery, and no-one did, or was allowed to, take it too far..\n\nI realize this was three generations ago, but was it like this in the US in the 60s?",

    "postText": "My aunt (now 40) have three kids under the age of 10. At every family gathering I (23m) become the defacto babysitter despite me not wanting to so the adults can drink. It was her birthday dinner yesterday and my mom promised me that I wouldnt have to babysit and that the kids would be at a friends house. \n\nThe first step I take into their home is greeted by two earsplitting screams about how much the kids missed me and one toddlery jodeling. I immediately realise I might have been lied to. Normally I dont drink (huge light weight) but since this was a special occasion I had made some plans. So my aunt enters the hall to greet my mom while I reach into my backpack and walk into the living room and crack one out of two 12% Viking beer I specialordered for me and my uncle (he likes weird beer) and we start drinking. About three minutes later my  aunt sees the can and starts screaming at me for drinking while watching the kids (I only hear distant screaming). \n\nI repeat my moms promise and she calls me the R word when they are clearly staying here. So I reach out my hand and say 200 bucks for emergency babysitting and I wont finish this beer. She says h*** no so I chug the half litre can to the loud cheers and laughs from my dad and uncle. When I'm done I say \"birth happy day mommy sister\" with a burp. With my mom just looking hugely embarrassed for my aunt. My designated driver dad ends up watching them the entire night instead, I think he might schedule a vasectomy soon.",

I had already taken a peak at the afternoon shift and found out there was only 2 people on shift, we needed 5 (completely her fault) so I told everyone that if we all leave on the dot she will have to stay and cover. \n\nWe all pretty much ran out of the house, everyone put their phone on silent and got in their cars, I'm a walker so I made my escape to the pub next door, 5 minutes later I get a call and she says \"we need you back here right now!\" I asked why and she very aggressively told me what I already knew xD and I said \"I'm very sorry, but that's not possible\" she asked why and I told her \"I've just had a pint and a whiskey\" and she had the cheek to say \"so!?\"... (This was a manager at a different house) and I just replied \"I've been drinking, you will have to find somebody else, or do it yourself, bye\" then hung up.\n\nGot drunk, walked to the shop, got more booze went home got more drunk. Next day I went back into work, was told that she stayed until 7pm and was not happy with me xD I just said \"well we aren't allowed to work after consuming alcohol, it's not my fault she messed up the rota\". She wasn't there but it got back to her and she didn't say another word to me for the rest of my time there xD shortly after that fiasco a different manager came in to do the rota and would actually listen to what days and shifts we wanted to do.",

They cancelled me at 4pm which is really early for a cancel, so I had a pop of rum since it was now my only night off that week (I was booked for 8 nights straight, because cancellations were common) and I was going to enjoy it. \n\nThey called me back at 8pm asking if I could still come in. I said no, I've been drinking because it's now my night off, and they shouldn't've cancelled me that early in the first place! They said they're really sorry but the AHNM was new and had missed an entire ward in the staff count and they were 2 short! I said sorry dude, that sounds like a problem you need to address with her, not me, because I cannot come in even if I still wanted to, I've been drinking!",

Bullying, intimidation, coercion, manipulation, and threats of firing are all in their arsenal to get you to come in. I\u2019ve heard of people being written up for not appearing to a shift they had previously declined to pick up. Do their employees hate them for it? Yes. But bosses get away with it because it isn\u2019t illegal and society at large seems to be ambivalent towards the practice (America has a long tradition of a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude). Saying you\u2019ve been drinking alcohol is a very simple excuse to wiggle your way out of getting called in and pretty much ends of the conversation for the employer to try and convince (read: threaten) you to come in",

It only ended when I was a freshmen in H.S  and my brother was playing and I passed out because I was so tired and he ended up breaking both of his legs because he fell from something. My stepdad was home but he fell asleep after his firefighter shift. After that they started to watch him. \n\nWas really annoying because my older sister could go out and do things but I had to watch my brother.\n\nIt also damaged my relationship with my brother for a bit because I felt more like a parent to him than a sibling. And I would try to discipline him(like tell him no) and my parents would overrule me. Overtime my brother learned that he really didn't have to listen to me. \n\nAlso turned me away from having kids for a long time. I'm slowly opening up to the idea but I struggle with the feeling that I've \"done it before\" so why would I want to again.",

    "postText": "This story happend a couple of years ago while doing my masters degree. I got a apartment with my friend (also doing her masters) infront of a beautiful lake. We had one neighbor upstairs and one next to us. We only shared the entrance with the upstairs neighbor. That's where we meet with \" Lady Cricket Lee\" the crazy californian cat lady that \"worked\" as a card reading/spiritual medium. \n\nThe region we lived in was very rural, it took 30mins to go to the closest Tim Hortons if you get the picture. The campus we attended was for the forestry students and was located very far from the main campus for the purposes of being close to a natural reserve and sylviculture sites. We were around 30 students and the campus was in a village of 1500 habitants. \n\nMe and my friend were over the moon with this apartment. We both were doing exhausting filed survey for our research and this place was gonna be our little heavenly home. The first upstairs neighbors were kicked out the same month we got in because of suspected domestic abuse.  That was a rocky start for us having to hear their yelling and loud make up sex. But we were positive that the next neighbor wasn't going to be worse than them..... Oh how we were wrong .. \n\nThis lady called helself \" Lady Cricket Lee\" and came from California. She was a hippie with a mean soul. When I met her the first time I introduced myself to her and explained that we were 2 very quite students and wanted nothing more than to relax at home. That's when she told be about her work and gave me a card with her email address.\n\nThis apartment wasn't soundproof at all. We could hear her snore! She had cats and we could hear them running and playing with bells throughout the nights. She was allowed to have 2 cats but turns out she had 7!!  2 adults and 5 kittens. They would knock down items on the ground and it really impacted our sleep. We were students, so we were already sleep deprived from our summer of stress and field work. \n\nAfter 2 months she started complaining that we were **poisoning her with our detergent**. I am not making this up. She accused us of sending  chemical fumes from our detergent though our dryer and making her sick... First of all, clothes detergent don't produce fumes when being dried up. And secondly the dryer vent sends the humidity outside, not to her appartement. You could see the vapor from the vent outside! But nooo, Cricket was yelling and cussing from the second floor that we were trying to kill her. She complained to the landlord (a real pushover). The landlord asked us to used organic and eco friendly products, to witch we explained that we were already using before she even moved in. We also took the time to complain about the noise and cat litter that she leaves in the share entrance **next to our door**. Again I am not kidding. She walk down her set of stairs to put the dirty cat litter in a carbord box. \n\nWe have a shared basement for all the tennants. At first we thought it was a box from our other neighbors until the smell became too much and we took a look inside...  Cat $h\u00eft and piss.. It it wasn't enough for Cricket. She was a heavy weed smoker and woud smoke at the top of the stairs. When we complain about the smell, her solution was to keep smoking in the share entrance and  cover up the smell with cheep insence AND a cheap air freshener ( those sold at the dollars store). \n\nIt was disgusting and my friend started getting asthma attacks and headache from perfume allergies. Were were even more stressed and sleep deprived. We couldn't do laundry without being yelled at and cuss from the floor above. Laundry became a stressful task. We would start a wash and leave as quickly as possible and come back to dry it and leaves again. After 3-4 months it all became too much and we gave an ultimatum to our landlord. It's us or her. He took too long to make his choice so we left and only paid half of the rent. \n\nNow fo the petty revenge. I knew her work email from the card she game me. I must have entered it about 200 times. News letters from buzzfeed to Best Buy and every store I could think of. I sign her up to every drug addict center. I subscribe her to daily religious prayers from Christians to musulmans. I also used her e-mail for adult site. If a sextoy brand had a newsletter, i would put her in. All sorts of alcoholic AA style of website. Sextherapy website, you name it!  For about 2 weeks straight I would search online for every website I could used to make her work email a hell hole of spam and unusable. It was oddly therapeutic. \n\nWhen we found a new place, we left the radio on and loud in the room below her bedroom for a couple of days. Right after that we came back to have a huge party (with our other neighbors concent). We took turn to knock on the ceiling though the night with the broom. She was screaming but we laughed it off. Everyone knew what a peice of trash she was. Our other neighbors had a very powerful stereo system that shakes the walls with the most annoying house music beat. There was a party below and next to her. We finished the party at 4 in the morning but the good neighbors were not done with her and left the apartment with the system on until later that morning. \nA couple of months after, the good neighbors told me that she was kicked out by the landlord. \n\nI keep using her email when I need to sing up for a public wifi. This all started back in 2018. F U Lady Cricket Lee (Patricia Lee). I don't regret doing it.\n\nEdits for spelling and translation mistakes \ud83d\ude18",

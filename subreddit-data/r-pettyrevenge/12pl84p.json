    "postText": "Pretty great story from work this morning where I got to one up this guy. So I\u2019ll start by saying I work for my dad at his store. I work the front counter and interact with most people/customers. Also, I look a lot more like my mom. My dad runs a separate business as well but anybody who needs to talk to him for either business can usually find him in the office here. \n\nSo this guy shows up this morning looking pretty ruffled and asks if my dad was here, I replied \u201cyou just missed him! He is out for the morning doing a couple things\u201d he was very displeased by this information and was acting very loud/unprofessional. He started looking around the store and eventually came back to the front counter with a piece of equipment that he wanted to \u201ctrade\u201d for some work that he apparently did for him before. Keep in mind I know most of my dads workers and have never seen this guy before. I told him that I don\u2019t do any negotiations while he\u2019s not here and I can\u2019t just let him leave the store with something for free. I told him that normally he probably wouldn\u2019t want to take that route but he was welcome to discuss it with him once he\u2019s back. \n\nHe looked at me and replied \u201cYou\u2019re making a big mistake here and you must not know _____ very well, because he would do this for me and blah blah blah.\u201d I just looked at him and replied, \u201cI actually do know him quite well, seeing as he is my father.\u201d \n\nI told him that he could either leave or wait for my dad to get back. He kind of looked up at me and was pretty speechless, I could tell he felt stupid and regretted his comment. He ended up waiting around in his truck for my dad to show up and guess what? He wasn\u2019t gonna do a trade. It\u2019s almost like I know my boss well. Apparently the guy just worked like 2 days for him and then quit. Plus the thing he wanted was way more expensive than what he was owed (side note the pay wasn\u2019t made yet because we are bi weekly). I swear some of the people around here are nuts. But a petty \u201cdon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d moment made my day.",

I always loved the look on their face when I\u2019d correct them, subtly letting them know I was aware they didn\u2019t really know her or they would know how to say her name.",

She passed suddenly and we grabbed a local pastor last minute to officiate the service in a small town. He pronounced her full name the way it\u2019s spelled and certainly a common pronunciation during the funeral service, but not the way she pronounced it. And she was adamant that it be pronounced HER way. So at the grave side later I pulled him aside and told him the correct pronunciation. He launches into his spiel, and then pronounces it correctly, followed by, \u201cor however it\u2019s pronounced, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026she\u2019s in Heaven now anyway.\u201d I\u2019ve never wanted to punch someone so badly.",

On my sheet it's noted he's a boy!\". Never have I been so scared! It can be a real hassle to correct such an administrative mistake, and have real repercussions, like not being able to find a nanny, a pediatrician or later get diplomas! \n\nThankfully, it was just the hospital making this mistake, not the civil servant.",

This was around the late 1920s to early 1930s. She started writing her name in the space for the baby's name instead of the mother's. Fortunately, she had only written the first few letters, so she turned Ros... to 'Roscoe'. The baby was supposed to be named, 'David', so he grew up being called David. Great uncle David didn't find out about this until he asked for his birth certificate when he wanted to join the army.",

She was scandalized, shook her finger at all the kids, and grabbed Berta's arm in a death grip. Which of course set all of them off again.\n\nAfter the service, the priest shook hands with the family and offered his condolences. He cut Berta a disapproving look, so she kept hold of his hand and patted it fondly, loudly saying \"It's Kathleen, Father, with a K.\" He had the grace to blush. As she walked away on the arm of some relative or other, she said in the same tone, \"Goodness! They get younger every time, don't they?\" Berta only was hard of hearing when she could play it for comedic effect or get rid of spam callers.\n\nOddly, that priest never accepted my MIL's invitation to dinner.",

They always made sure to have a stack on their person and more in their vehicles. But the number of times someone would come in, name-drop one of them then demand to be allowed in for free! \u201cJoe, who is your boss (like we didn\u2019t know), said we should come by and see a free movie sometime. He said whenever we wanted, we could just come to the counter and get tickets.\u201d Ummm\u2026 No. Some of them even referred to the bosses as \u201cMr.\u201d and looked shocked when we used their shortened first names as if we should be speaking their names with reverence and not like we saw them daily and occasionally got plastered together at work parties! There were occasions when one of them would call and say that so-and-so was coming in and to let them in for free but that was very rare. \n\nFunny- even though they always claimed they were such close, longtime friends, if I offered to call the office and see if their dearest, most beloved pal was in, they suddenly wanted to pay and didn\u2019t want to disturb anyone, although they assured me they would be informing their bff of my rudeness. Also funny- I never heard about any of those complaints. LOL!",

People used to try that line with me all the time and I would just internally roll my eyes and tell them they were free to call him and ask themselves (since they would have his cell number, right?) or come in when he\u2019s there. My favorite, though, was a woman who swore she knew the owner well, they were old friends, they\u2019d even grown up together, why can\u2019t I just let her have x product for free since SHE would have done it, etc. It was the \u201cshe\u201d comment that really caught my ear. The bakery was named after the owner\u2019s (male, very male name) only daughter (very, very female name). We aren\u2019t in the south, there\u2019s no illusion of a man named Shirley here. I said, \u201cOh, you grew up with (female name)?\u201d \u201cYes, and we\u2019re very good friends.\u201d \n\nThe owners daughter was a good twenty years younger than this woman and had at that point not set foot in the store in about 15 years. She was attending a school in another state entirely for something extremely non-related to the bakery. \n\n\u201cOh. Well, she doesn\u2019t work here, so I have no idea who was masquerading as her!\u201d She sputtered. Tried to double down in disbelief that there was literally no employee by that name. I told her that was a name very dear to the owner, but definitely not HIS name. \n\nShe turned around and stormed out. Called the next day earlier in the day to demand to speak to (female name). Was told by someone else that no one actually works there by that name and called twice more during the week before she gave up. Wasn\u2019t the last time I saw her, but was the last time she tried for FREE shit. It was just a sea of expired coupons after that.",

I will tell him you were him and say hello for you\". We were almost finished and they said it again. Again I was fake-happy \"haha nice\" and asked for a full price. days later I had a moment of enlightenment that they were trying to get some discount, but they were not pushy about it and I was slow that day and didnt recognize what they were asking for (still their fault for not asking directly, not that it would change anything, because I would call my boss' phone number). funny part is that name of the owner is in the name of the company, so anyone could say that they know him by name etc",

Little did they know he's my brother, we look nothing alike.  So when I'd call him and say \"bro, got a customer that's demanding to speak to you\". Then hand them the phone, he would then tell them that they were wasting his time and he wouldn't have anything different to tell them, \"you are just going to have to accept what my brother has already told you\".  And then I'd ask, \"well, what did he say?\"  Never got tired of that!",

He was an older gentleman and told me that my husband had told him he would be put to the front of the queue because his job was so important (I knew this was never something my husband would ever say given what we had on the shop floor already). I told him that he can\u2019t go to the front as I have X Y and Z waiting so there\u2019s no way he can get it done today, even that week.  He told me that he would be speaking to my husband about me and I may want to think about it.  I tried to show him the vast amount of jobs we already had piled up but he didn\u2019t want to even acknowledge it.  He got very uppity with me and asked if I valued my job.  (At this point the staff in hearing distance started laughing) I told him that I did however I didn\u2019t value his custom and given his dismissive view of the work we had to get through from other customers, just like him, he should go elsewhere from now on. He left shouting that \u201cthey\u201d (sweeping arm statement at the staff) shouldn\u2019t be laughing and I would be sacked. \n\nMy husband got a phone call later that day from the guy who had told him that his secretary was losing him business and he should rethink his hiring process. He even said the words \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to see anyone out of a job but you have to think of your business\u201d my husband replied with \u201cuh, she\u2019s my boss so if she says you need to go elsewhere there\u2019s nothing I can do for you.\u201d Then he hung up on him.  \n\nNever saw him again \ud83e\udd23.",

Our local college football team had been winning and working on moving up nationally. After one of the games the coach, some staff and their spouses came in to celebrate. Head coach was a complete ass. Ordering multiple rounds of drinks when people were telling him no. Anyway, closing time comes around and I do last call. In true alpha ass fashion, he orders everyone at his table two more. I mean, really!  I pointed out that his wife still had three drinks to finish in the next 20 minutes. He insisted I bring them anyway. Ok, his dime. \n\nI'm sure you can see where this train is headed. Closing time arrives and I start moving people out the door. I saved the coaches table for last, I know trouble when I see it. When they finally get up to leave,  head coach starts picking up full drinks and heading for the door. I step in and tell him he'll have to leave the drinks as its illegal to bring open drinks out of bars here. Of course, big time coach gets really close and starts learning over me(I'm 5'4\" he was approx 6'3\") and busts out the \"do you know who I am? \" line. I was in prime form and ready.  Simply said \"yep, still don't give a damn, it's still illegal\" lifted the drinks out of his hands and walked away. My bartender was trying to look stern and not laugh. Coaches wife just dragged him out of the bar. To this day, it's the one phrase that sets me off.",

Hope she got those nails done for that killer price down the street. For the record, the price she said she can get them for was a complete lie. How did I know?

Guy calls in and wants to do the deal but wants 1 large and 1/2 off a medium.\n\n\"Sorry, I can't upgrade the size has to be 2 mediums\" in my best customer service voice.\n\n\"I know Mike, the owner, he'd be fine with it.\"\n\n\"Great, just have him give me a call that's ok and I'll get on it.\"\n\n\"Can I get his phone number?\" Note to the reader, Mike did not want his personal phone number given out.\n\n\"If you know him so well, shouldn't you have it already?\" I replied. He hangs up.\n\nI call Mike and relay what just happened letting him know I may have upset a friend. He says he wouldn't give his mom that deal. We make more on medium pizzas than large that's why the deal is 2 mediums.\n\nAbout 5 mins later I see a man walking quite angrily by our front windows and who is it but the man from the phone earlier.\n\n\"Who was I talking to on the phone?\" He yells.\n\n\"Me\" As I raise my hand.\n\n\"I'm not talking to you anymore\" as he looks at my co-worker.\n\n\"He's in charge tonight so you better\" My co-worker replies.\n\n\"I want to talk to Mike\" I had already hit redial to call Mike.\n\nMan talks on the phone, calls me unprofessional to Mike and hangs up. Apparently, angry man used to work for Mike. I take his order and we start making his 2 medium pizzas. He goes on about how unprofessional I was and I say \"I've had a long hard day, sorry if I was a bit short with you on the phone.\"\n\nHe goes off \" YOU had a hard day, I work 2 construction jobs 60 hours a week, 2 kids and a wife to take care off, you don't know a HARD day.\"\n\nI'm just like \"Dude, I didn't say I had a harder day than you... we can both have a hard day. And working as hard as you do, how do you respond when someone who isn't your boss tells you how to do your job.\"\n\nGuy instantly realized what a HUGE dick he was being and apologiezed. He then asked to use the bathroom.\n\nNow for context, my coworker looked like a sterotypical stoner from any movie ever, while I passed as a straight laced good christian boy.\n\nPreviously angry guy comes out of the bathroom.  And hands me some crumpled up paper towel. \"Here, this **isn't** garbage. Given your buddy here I assume you guys wind down after work\" (He was talking about smoking weed, if you missed it).\n\nWe have some chit chat whiles his pizzas cook and once it slows down we check the paper towel and there is a bud in there that was about an 1/8 oz (3.5g) on its own. One of the things that made Mike a cool boss is he didn't care if we smoked weed for close down, AFTER the doors were locked.\n\nI had to deal with a few crazy angry customers but this was the biggest 180 I ever had. Angry man was ready to deck me when I said \"Me\" holding my hand up. I **did** have a smug look on my face cause I knew my ass was covered after talking to Mike on the phone.",

A few minutes later friends dad comes rolling up on his own cart and addresses him as his son.  Other guy sputters something about disrespectful kids gets red faced and leaves.

I've known the owner for years and know very well that the only way that would be true is if he contacted me personally first. When I informed the man of this he exploded, saying how I won't have a job tomorrow, I'm going to regret this, ect. I called my hostess over and asked her if she knew him. She said no and told him to leave. I then informed him that she was our owner's ( only ) daughter and in typical Italian Princess fashion if he knew her father he would know exactly who she was. He left. All of the owners real friends always insisted on paying, every time. They were happy to support us. \n\nPrincess was wonderful btw, I missed her when she went away to school.",

That\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned in my 20 years of working retail for the same boss. 99% of the time the boss actually hates them and they are only trying to pull that shit after they have discovered the boss isn\u2019t even there.",

One time, a lady came in and was asking about a sale, and I politely told her the items she wanted were excluded from the sale (very obvious, always had labels saying what was on sale and what wasn\u2019t.) She didn\u2019t buy anything. \n\nTwo days later, when I also work, she comes back in and tells a coworker that the \u201cowner\u2019s granddaughter\u201d said she could have a discount because she\u2019s a family friend. I emerges from the back and gave her a wtf face, and my coworker, laughing very hard, explained that the owner doesn\u2019t have any children (or grandchildren) and that I also wouldn\u2019t hand out discounts without checking with a more senior coworker. She very sheepishly bought her stuff and has not come in again. (Though she still places orders with us by phone or email.)\n\nPeople thought I was related to the owner or other employees constantly and often tried to pull that kinda card.",

He knows good and well one of the two owners is my dad, and the other manager was my older brother, and both he and I obviously had a direct line of communication with our dad and knew he had no issues with me being taught these repairs. I don\u2019t know how he thought he would get away with such a bold faced lie",

The \u201cdon\u2019t you know who I am\u201d encounters I have regularly never fail to amuse me.\n\nOne guy in particular stands out because argued with me about paying cover charge.

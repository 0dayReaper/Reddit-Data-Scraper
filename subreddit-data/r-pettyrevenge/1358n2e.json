    "postText": "My whole extended family went on vacation when I was in middle school and stayed in one big house. When we were about to go swimming and I was changing, my younger cousin kept coming up to the keyhole and peeking in. I was a 12 year old girl and he was a 10 year old boy and I was really upset. I\u2019d yell at him and he\u2019d run away, but then sneak back. \n\nI realized the door opened OUT towards where he was coming from, so after I was all ready, I watched for him to come back and slammed the door into his head right as he was bending down to peek again. \nHe screamed and of course his mom came running and I was like \u201c??? I opened the door because I was done\u2026.why would I have thought to see if he was there?\u201d and totally played dumb. It\u2019s not like he could say anything to defend himself because then he\u2019d be in trouble. \n\nI didn\u2019t get in trouble and he left me alone after that. He was always was bigger and stronger and this time I felt like I \u201cwon\u201d for the first time.",

Even writing that sentence feels wrong, but the simple fact is kids need to understand the sexual urges they experience before they have them, and very few are properly taught about that stuff. Most kids begin going through puberty between the ages of 8 to 14. Those same kids typically won't learn any sex education until high school. For kids that \"blossomed\" before then, that means several years of hormones and urges that nobody is teaching them about. You can't expect a child going through puberty to handle it with grace and control when nobody is helping them navigate. Yes. The 10-year-old was being a creep. He might even know it's wrong, but no 10-year-old should be expected to fully understand the ramifications of their actions. They should be disciplined and educated accordingly.",

Because teaching involves failing and being corrected. \n\nTen year olds know right from wrong, but they don\u2019t necessarily understand the *why* yet. The differences in how wrong something is are nuances that we don\u2019t understand until we\u2019re older, with context and time. 10 year olds haven\u2019t had much of either yet. \n\nWriting my comment off as \u201cboys will be boys\u201d fundamentally misunderstands the point of my comment: he likely didn\u2019t know how serious of an issue this was, and hopefully learned it was serious to OP when she gave him some real consequences. \n\nBut let\u2019s not judge somebody for the rest of their life for one mistake they made when they were 10.

You don't have to agree, and I'm certain you won't, but I stand by what I said. There is no way to tell if this incident had done anything to cure him of his desire to spy on naked girls. And no real way to determine if he's still like that now considering OP herself doesn't know. \n\nBut an indicator was clearly there, so... it's fine to say that it's a red flag that shouldn't be ignored and most certainly cannot be ruled out even as he got older. Remember, he didn't confess to his mom about what he was doing, so it's not like anyone actually pulled him aside to tell him why his actions were messed up. He may not have learned a lesson at all.",

Even the person you initially responded to didn't say that. I don't think that, and I doubt they do either.  You pulled that straight out of your own asshole and it's pretty astonishing that you jump to such extremes with no room for nuance. There's just no need. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that we can't just assume the kid grew out of those inclinations he displayed. He might not have, and that's a valid thing to say is possible, because it is. \n\nSuppose OP had actually gone to the boy's mother later on to tell him what he had been doing? Do you think his mother should've waved it off saying \"oh, I'm sure he'll grow out of it?\" Or do you think it would've been more appropriate for her to talk to him about his actions? \n\nBut we don't know what happened with this kid, so we can't just say for 100% certain he's super well-adjusted and has never done anything to make a woman uncomfortable since. I only said the above commenter \"could be\" right. I was just pointing out that it was absolutely a possibility. That's all. \n\nIt's fine for you to point out the opposite. Maybe he is fine these days. I certainly hope so. \n\nAnd hey. I'm not sure why you felt comfortable implying that I'm not a safe person for children to be around, but please take it easy. I'm not mad at you, I'm not your enemy, and I don't think you're stupid.  \n\nYou just jumped down that other commenter's throat with such an extreme response that I felt it was worth pointing out that they weren't automatically wrong for what they said. No one is saying you're wrong either. But you did turn it into an all-or-nothing type of scenario and it's fair to say that it's not so cut and dry.",

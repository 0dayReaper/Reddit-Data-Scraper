    "postText": "I own a big house. I am talking old Victorian type that I restored. An older couple moved in across the street this summer and started bitching about everything I did. They didn't like the siding I was having put on, my front door color was ugly, they hated all the different colored flowers I planted. They didn't like the idea a of a young, single woman living in a house I clearly couldn't afford. They actually toldme that.\n\n I tried to ignore them until Christmas. I put up lights and a few blow ups but nothing the other neighbors don't do. This couple started bitching right off. Christmas offended them. I just smiled and added more. At this moment my house can be seen on Mars. To add to the petty I told the neighbor next to me and he told another and then another. You get the picture.",

It gets old REALLY quick. So, I prefer the perverse, perverted, warped, twisted, sexualized, and otherwise questionable Christmas tunes. Even then, I don't end up playing it on repeat for hours/days/weeks on end. There is too much other great music out there to listen to.",

Literally the only purpose of those steps was so she could climb up and peer into my yard. Thankfully the other neighbor just refused to rebuild them, said it was an entire new job and he didn\u2019t have time for it.\n\n*edited to change a word I messed up.

He begged us to mow our garden, even tried to order us and get the 'authorities' involved. He even offered to mow it for us. He doesn't want to put more chemicals to get rid of the additional insects we are 'producing' because he has young kids but he can't stand them either. It's like those people who can't see a painting hanging sideway without putting it right, the look on his face when he looks at our garden...  \n\nHe also noted with pleasure that his small kitchen garden is now giving way more than before, his apple trees are producing apples at last. \n\nOne day we will tell him about plants and bees. \n\nMeanwhile we enjoy the tall grass, the insects buzzing busily, and discovering all the different wild flowers of different height blooming at different times of the year, and listen to the weekly mowing next door.",

It's not light but it wasn't too heavy for me to pick up. So I loaded them on a cart in the back, or of his sight, and walked him up front. Now, I'm used to living this stuff up but I know the carry outs aren't so I told the gentleman that I'd load it in his car for him. He insisted that of the carry outs couldn't do it that he could and he would just put them in his basket. Which doesn't really hold the cases well but I thought whatever. So he turns around to talk to someone and I'm putting the cases of water on his shopping cart and he turns around as I'm putting the last case on and sees me do it. He then yells out in surprise, for everyone up front to hear \"Omg you shouldn't be lifting that! You've got babies to make!\" I just walked away. \n\nAt that point in my life, I hadn't planned on having anymore children. I ended up getting pregnant a few years later and still worked in the grocery store not in the meat department where I was picking up much heavier cases of meat than that water ever was.  But, I was still flabbergasted at his response to me doing my job.",

My dream all my life has been to Clark Griswold a house but couldn't this year cause our roof was getting replaced. I was disappointed but put up a few of the lights I had gotten, but wasn't going to do more, so I could focus on fixing up the house. \n\nWell our neighbor specifically makes a point to comment about how bright our lights are and how he couldn't stand putting up decorations anymore cause why spend the time on that when you could go traveling instead. Sort of shit he says all the time whenever I'm out trying to work on the gardens or fix some of the other things outside.\n\nWell wouldn't you know, I just had to put up a ton of inflatables, some of which just don't make any sense. Christmas snail carrying gifts, some goats wearing pajamas, a hippopotamus, and Santa riding a polar bear that moves its head.\n\nWell he kept making the comments and luckily my roof replacement was competed the day before Christmas Eve. So on Christmas Eve I was out there putting up some of the lights that I got synchronized up to make a light show. Plus I busted out the speakers and the projectors. All the stuff that didn't involve a large ladder.\n\nHe didn't say anything since. Next year he is going to hate it cause I am going to go full Griswold.\n\nThe real great thing about this is I think I triggered a Christmas decorating Cold War with the neighbor across the street. They had been the kings of decorating before we moved in I guess. So they had some decorations out and some lights. I put up the initial amount, then I noticed that they put some more up the next day. Every time I put some more up to spite my neighbor, the neighbor across the street put up more. Then the neighbors next to him got in on the act. The Grinch's house is the only one in the cul-de-sac that is undecorated and thus stands out greatly now.",

Wether it be due to neighbors, stray dogs/cats/pests, a busy road, elevation levels, or a park nearby.\n\nIt seems like such a slap in the face, IMO. It's somewhat avoidable, but nonetheless overwhelmingly unpredictable. I'm sorry you're having to deal with less than stellar neighbors; I think they sound like righteously indignant mf'ers who could benefit from being put in their place, but it's not a great longterm solution. \n\nReally the only thing you can control in this situation is yourself and how you react! And, it seems, your other neighbors have your back so that is of course a big bonus. So far your petty revenge has been noble and elegant, and I hope to have a second installment from OP sometime soon!",

    "postText": "I used to work in the business office for a huge medical clinic. There was one girl who was the manager's secretary. She was really petite, very pretty and a little \"southern belle\". She was the darling of the office but she was a cunt bully. She made fun of everyone who was overweight, to their faces, in front of everyone. I had just had my daughter and she was relentless when I went to McDonalds for lunch one day. \"You should have gotten a salad, for crying out loud, piggy\".\n\nBecause she was the prima donna in the office, and the head of HR was her mom's bff. nothing ever happened to her.\n\nFast forward years later, I took my nephew to a birthday party this weekend. She was there with her three kids. Turns out that 5 marriages and three kids have not been good to her she is pushing 300 pounds on a 5'3 frame. She looks HIT! Those good looks up and left a decade or two ago. She saw me and her jaw dropped. She said in the fakest voice and smile she could muster \"You look so pretty! I had no idea you were that pretty! You are so tiny!\" I just smiled and said, \"Yeah, I know\" and walked away. I got immense satisfaction watching this bully waddling around in the heat. Even her nose got fat. Not saying anything else to her the whole day was really making her uncomfortable.",

Ended up talking with a guy from another department known for his backhanded compliments and ego. I knew him fairly well and he thought he knew me, but I act differently with coworkers than with friends. He introduced me to one of his friends that night with \"Nancy isn't the best looking girl here but she's all right.\" I immediately countered, speaking to the friend, with \"hi there, yes it's too bad. I can always put on more makeup yet Dave here will always be an asshole.\" I smiled at both of them and just dared him to try another. Maybe it was how drunk he was or how drunk he thought I might have been, but he was actually floored with my quick response, and to top it off his friend laughed at him.  \n\nBecause this is reddit I will also add, no, not everyone laughed. But he never tried that shit with me again.",

I was around 300 lbs, and have kept off the 145 lbs for 11 years .  It took a year to lose it all. I rarely eat lots of carbs, I need to aim for the protein first. \n\n  It has taken time to learn what food I can eat, and I keep to that.  I ordered a chicken parm , instead of pasta, I got rice,  ate 1/4 cup of that, and less than half the chicken parm. That will make a meal or two later....\nIf I want pasta, 4 noodles, and I am done.  Bread must be toasted like a bruschetta toast.  One piece, and I am done.  I rarely feel hungry.  It is work,  a lapband is not a magic wand.  It's a tool to use .  Get the rules. And follow them, it will work.   \n\nA good protein supplement is Bolthouse Protein Plus. \nI like the coffee flavor, and the chocolate flavor.  They supplement your meals, they do not replace them .\n\nOn.the topic of living well after?  Before the procedure, my EX  was rude and snarky,  sarcastic.  After?  He avoids me at parties.  Oh darn.",

All the mean girls in high school were all over me for being fat, a pig, disgusting, you name it. They made my life hell. What they didn\u2019t know was I was struggling with severe back pain and on steroids, which made me blow up like a balloon. From 6th grade on, I\u2019d spend a week on steroids, 3 weeks off. The weight gain piled up in spite of (severely) restricted calories and an inability to truly, properly exercise. (I still rode horses but that only made things worse. Hindsight and all that..) \n\nFast forward to the ten year reunion. I skipped it but looked at the pics with interest. Every mean girl was now fat. And not the 20-30 lbs I had been. We\u2019re talking massively obese. They all has kids. And all but 2 were divorced. \n\n20 year? They were unrecognizable. I needed to see the names under the pictures to recognize them. More divorces, some on their 2nd or 3rd. More kids. The smiles weren\u2019t real. \n\n30 year? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m married for 25 years, no kids by choice, happy, have accomplished some pretty awesome things and kept pursuing sport even after being paralyzed by an illness. I also lost a lot of weight medical issues packed on and I look much younger than they do. No wrinkles, no sun damaged skin. No wear and tear, not broken down by a shit life and shit decisions. \n\nI ran into one of the mean girls when I visited my hometown last year. \u201cMichelle, is that you? Oh. My. You.. look. *nice.\u201d* \n\nShe didn\u2019t recognize me. I had to tell her who I was and she couldn\u2019t grasp the \u201cfat\u201d girl now looked better and was less fat than she was. I kind of felt sorry for her. Even though she put me through hell as a kid, life had beaten her down hard. \n\nI\u2019m still fat. I could stand to lose probably 80 lbs. but it\u2019s hard in a wheelchair, only my arms work and my injury level is just around the bra band. I exercise as I can, do as much as I can for myself and watch calories and carbs, drink mostly water, avoid soda (reg and diet) and eat a lot of protein since carbs mess with my blood glucose (T2 diabetes) and too much fiber messes with my colostomy. \n\nIt\u2019s a balancing act but I\u2019m good at it. I lost 100+ lbs. over the last few years and I keep losing weight slowly, much of it added by various medications with weight gain side effects that I need to stay comfortable and you know. Alive.",

My husband, then boyfriend, cottoned onto this and tried to keep him away from me but either way it didn\u2019t really matter because we both moved interstate together to pursue work opportunities. We lost touch with his friend group but were reunited when one of the guys got married some years later. The nasty guy was there and the years had NOT been kind, he was chubby and had started balding. Not the hot shot he once thought he was. He came over to talk to us and I braced myself, put on a polite smile. My husband though was caught offguard and said, \u201cHoly hell man, what happened to you?!\u201d The look on his face was the best revenge I could have asked for.",

It never really bothered me because she was no beauty queen, but oh it felt sooooo sweet to see that after her marriage to guy in a local band and their first baby she is a good 275lb and shaped like a Frigidaire. I've since had baby number four, and have been promoted well at work so I was able to afford a tummy tuck that gave me a 28in waist. Gotta love it when karma comes back strong!",

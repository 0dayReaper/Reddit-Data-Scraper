    "postText": "I fell down my stairs Thursday morning less than 2 hours before I was to be at work. I work at my local gas station making pizzas and other food items. I couldn't find my own replacement so I went to work. I bruised my ribs quite badly. I was 9 minutes late clocking in and I told my boss right away what happened and I was moving kinda slow. Friday, I clocked in 6 minutes late because the registers were being used and I couldn't clock in right away. I told them I have to leave for a Dr's apt after 4 hours as it's the only time I can be seen before the weekend, which I also work. \nThanks to medication the Dr gave me I fell asleep after sending kids to school and woke up 5 minutes before I was supposed to be at work. I immediately messaged both the manager and the kitchen person in duty for the next hour that I was running late and will be there before she leaves at 11... which I was. \n\n\nMonday, I get written up for being late and leaving early.  Now, the Dr didn't just give me medication, he wanted to give me a work release for the weekend as well as Monday and Today (our truck day) but I told him no because I didn't wanna screw my teammates and my boss over cuz it's mother's day weekend. And I'm a mother. I could've gotten it off. \n\nSo today, after I get off my 2 hour early morning shift of putting frozen crap away with still bruised still painful ribs, I go to the Dr again and say \"I guess I should have taken your note, doc. I got written up for being late the days of my known injury. Sure would be nice to have an even longer note now. Say... till next Monday maybe?\"\n\nThat's how I got a week off work. And the best part is this is my exact message.....\n\n\"Hey boss,\nAs you know, I fell down my steps on Thursday, 5/11. When I went to the dr on Friday, 5/12, he tried to give me a Dr's note off work, but I told him if he gave me one, I wouldn't turn it in because I wasn't leaving my team high and dry and that would screw my boss over it being mothers day weekend and all.\nWell, when I went back to him today, I told him I should have taken that note because I got written up for my tardiness due to my injury. \nHe told me I'm not healing very fast due to working so if I didn't take this one, he was bringing it to you himself.\nI wanted to give it to you asap as I'm not getting back to town for awhile.\nI will bring the physical copy in when I get back home.\"\n\nThis is the third time they have tried to screw with me and I maliciously complianced or just petty revenged their butts way deeper into the dirt than they knocked my butt into. \n\nI wonder when they will learn to just leave me be and let me work.",

Over here, in Europe (or, in this case, Germany) you just call in sick and go to a doctor. That's it.\n\n* if the doctor writes you ill for 7 days, then so be it. You'll get full pay for up to 6 weeks. After that, it's reduced, but you won't starve to death at all\n* no concept of \"sick days\"\n* not your job to look at replacements. I mean, if your boss didn't hire enough stuff to cope with such circumstances, it's his fault. Being understaffed saves him expenses, but it doesn't anything for you.",

Taking it isn\u2019t giving them what they deserve, it\u2019s giving *you* what *you* deserve. I feel like this workplace has conditioned you to think that taking time off that you are entitled to is some kind of a reward or a win for you. They *owe you this*, and then some. Never forget it!",

These ppl would schedule him for work when they knew he had soccer games/practice after telling him they\u2019d work around it.  They also would not give him time off when both of his grandfathers passed away within 6 months of each other.  One time he hurt his ankle really bad in a game.  Black and blue and swollen where he could not wear a shoe.  Tried to call in for his shift and was told he would need a doctor\u2019s note.  Even though it was a Sunday, I drove him to the clinic.  It was badly sprained but not broken.  Doctor wrote a note for 2 weeks off his ankle when all he wanted was the one day.  He happily (with only one shoe on) walked in and slapped that note down \ud83d\ude02.",

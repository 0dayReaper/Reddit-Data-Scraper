    "postText": "So, I do this club called \u201cYouth In Government\u201d (we make bills and debate them it\u2019s actually really fun). And I was partnered with \u201cBella\u201d the most pretentious person ever. Like that stick is so far up her ass you can see it when she opens her mouth. Anyways we write our bill and all is well and oh no I need to miss a meeting because I\u2019m literally going to be in a different city for TSA state comps. Mind you I give her plenty of notice (at least a week). She\u2019s cool with it again all is well. The next week rolls around and I get sick at school. So, I have to go home and I EMAIL HER that I won\u2019t be there because I am quite literally so sick. And the I get the most condescending email ever about how I \u201cmissed too many meetings and didn\u2019t do any work only looked over stuff,\u201d like, no I wrote our entire Intro, Summation, and did all the research. Now we\u2019re to my petty moment. We had a meeting today and I realized she was not present. And I did what any sensible person would and copy and pasted the email she sent me and sent it to her. And rather than being pretentious and saying \u201cRegards\u201d at the end I said in the most condescending way \u201cAdios Amiga.\u201d\n\nTL;DR:\nPretentious teammate is pissed at me for missing two club meetings after giving her notice and sends a super condescending email then she misses today\u2019s meeting and I copy and paste her email and send it to her.",

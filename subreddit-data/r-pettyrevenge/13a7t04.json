This was a sucky project that nobody wanted because it was impossible at the price the customer wanted. But we tried anyway because small profit margins are still profit margins. \n\nWe already had a few quotes from potential suppliers proving that the customers budget was unrealistic. But my boss and coworker kept bugging me anyway. Even though I had no control over who would take interest and respond to the inquiry. \n\nAlso tried sending out email blasts (which no one responded to, unsurprisingly) and we don\u2019t have any contacts in this region for me to reach out to personally.

    "postText": "I'm planning on transferring to Gonzaga in the fall, I am trying to figure out the best living situation..\n\nI figured I have a few options\n\n1. Apartment style housing on Campus\n2. Off campus housing in the Logan neighborhood owned by GU\n3. Find my own place/apartment \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComing in as a transfer my biggest concern is meeting people and making friends, as I am missing out on that experience by not being a freshman in the dorms. \n\nAre there any benefits to staying in apartments on campus vs off? Are there still opportunities to meet other students by staying in the Logan neighborhood?",

I didn't meet a single person I didn't know from living there. I would honestly say your best bet would be doing a GU owned house that will put you with people or maybe find a house where someone is going abroad and they need a lease take over. Some friends of mine had a transfer move in with them as a lease take over and he became one of their best friends pretty quick.",

People post in Gonzaga Class of *fill in appropriate year* on Facebook about needing subleasers or even someone to join their group and live with them. Great way to meet some new people and hopefully get a room out of it. There is also an off-campus housing page for Gonzaga [here](https://gonzagaoffcampus.org/) if you haven\u2019t seen it. Good luck and go Zags! Hope you enjoy your time here",

Living with people I've never met could always be risky but at least I'll immediately meet other GU students and their friends too!",

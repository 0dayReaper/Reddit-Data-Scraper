    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am an admitted student from the East Coast considering dedicating to Gonzaga. One main issue that has come up for me is finding a place to live during the summer. Given that most internships are offered during the summer, I would likely have to live in Spokane during this period since it is unlikely the school would be able to connect me to an internship on the East Coast.\n\nIs it possible to find roommates to share an apartment with during the summer? Does anyone know of out-of-state students staying in Spokane during the summer and how they were able to do that? From your point of view what would be the cost per month of rent if you are living with roomates?\n\nThank you for your help.",

            "comment": "I think it depends really. Gonzaga is very social and most find it easy to find a tight friend group by the time internships become a thing. One thing to consider is that many Zags get internships in places outside of Spokane and need to find housing for the summer which is always a struggle but I would say it is usually the easiest in Spokane since Gonzaga usually has plenty of room in dorms for undergrads, resources for finding sub-leasing off campus, and typically after sophomore year people have started renting houses that will not be fully occupied in the summer. I had multiple friends either stay in their house after sophomore year if they were working in Spokane or sublet their room to someone who needed it for the summer. I\u2019d also like to add that a few of my friends who got internships in San Francisco and Seattle but did not live there permanently ended up living with one of their friends\u2019 families from the area during the summer. Overall it\u2019s a pretty good community for finding housing so it\u2019s typically not a problem for most people.",

Take this whole experience one step at a time. \n\nYou will find an internship at home or here or another city. If you choose to live in Spokane there are tons of houses. Some people sign annual leases and then sublease so they can go back home for the summer. It's also pretty likely that if you want an internship it won't be in Spokane it would be remote or in a big city.",

Between my Sophomore/Junior year I stated in a house with some friends and subletted rent. Between Junior/Senior year I lived in the Kennedy apartments and there was a separate rate for staying in the summer compared to my yearly room and board. The actual costs these days I'm not sure, but it's very doable and was very easy to organize.",

Many student who attend Gonzaga are from out of state or Seattle so it\u2019s a common thing to find short term leases.",

They provide free housing as part of the job.",

The career center is incredibly helpful, they'll help you prepare for virtual interviews, find jobs, spice up your resume, etc. \n\nIf you do choose to find a job in Spokane, like several of my friends did, join the Gonzaga student Facebook group -- at the end of every semester there are ALWAYS people looking to sublease their rooms for the semester or the summer.",

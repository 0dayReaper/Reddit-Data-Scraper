We all know that March Madness is strongest for the men, especially for the showing the Gonzaga men have put on this season, but your 11th-seeded Bulldog women have upset their way into the Sweet 16, with their next game coming against 2nd-seeded Tennessee in Spokane!\n\nThis is a great opportunity for the Gonzaga women to find their way into the Elite 8, possibly even the Final Four as the next to two rounds are effectively home games.\n\nKeep up with women's basketball over on /r/NCAAW, and keep rolling!",

    "postText": "Play CS:GO? You're pretty good ya? Solid, listen up.\n\nGonzaga fielded an NCESPA (ie College online league) team last fall and it was a ton of fun playing CS with other Zags and meeting some new faces.\n\nEveryone but myself from that team are now either graduated or are several years removed from GU. NCESPA wants to know if GU will be returning for season two (three?) so I figured I'd test the waters and see who is out there.\n\nMyself: Senior, LEM rank.\n\nEven if you're not interested in fielding a team feel free to chime in with your Steam name, etc.\n\nRoll Zags.",

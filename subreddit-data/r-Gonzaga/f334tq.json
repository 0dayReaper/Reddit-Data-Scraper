And the building was for sure not dead, I spent more time in other people's suites than I did my own, and I knew pretty much everyone on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The suites also allowed for parties to be thrown that were slightly more hidden from the RAs.\nAs the other comment said, there are a few engineers that live there but most of them are super fun and actually do party and whatnot. It is great though.",

    "postText": "Hey y'all! I have a question about buying a router. I visited my friend this past summer at her college and she said that every person in the dorm buys their own router and has their own wifi in their rooms because the university wifi stinks and is slow. My brothers university did not allow people to buy their own routers. So I am wondering if 1) Gonzaga lets you buy routers for your room and 2) if you feel like it is needed or is the campus wifi good enough. thank you!",

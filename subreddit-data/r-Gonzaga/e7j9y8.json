I think people are becoming complacent. \n\nI do agree that ticketing is far from ideal and the timing of some of the games is poor but it makes me sad to be witnessing the disappearance of the kennel's prowess.\n\nThe thing that really makes me sad is that there wont even be a student section for arguably the biggest game ever in the kennel when North Carolina comes to town. But thats not the students fault.",

I didn't have time to deal with that stuff so I didn't and saw far fewer games than I would have liked. I imagine that our outdated \"traditional\" way of doing ticket distribution has caught up to the Kennel Club and students just don't want to or don't have time to deal with the bullshit.",

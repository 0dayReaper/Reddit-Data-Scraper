Due to being the only off campus dorm everyone in the dorm is really close which is great if you like a tight friend group. The activities to get the cord are super easy, anything from watching planet Earth and eating pizza to a week long trip in Moab. They have exclusive trips in partnership with GU outdoors and free rentals from GU outdoors. The rooms all have sinks which is nice and are on the larger size. The corner rooms are some of the largest door rooms on campus. Marian is a community (cult) beyond the dorm/LLC so upperclassmen tend to still be involved in some way with the dorm and it's traditions.",

Like I said because it's off campus everyone gets really close really fast so coming in a year later can definitely be a bit intimidating because lots of close bonds have already formed from the people who where there freshman year. It's still a welcoming community and they'd be great just in my opinion doing both years is much better. As for being on campus it really isn't that far, for instance it is closer to Hemmingson than Kennedy is. As for partying yes you are further from the dorms so won't be as involved in the 'CM/Desmet dorm parties' (just befriend a person in CM and you'll be fine if that's what you want) but you are in the Logan so closer to the house parties. House parties can be harder to get into freshman year but if you play your cards right you can get in and then be much closer to the house parties (for instance Moontower is right down the street). Also like I said a lot of the upperclassmen Marianites are still involved with the Marian community so if you befriend them that's a real easy way to have some upperclassmen friends who can invite you to their parties and such. One other note on that is usually the Marian RAs are past Marianites so some of the chiller RAs on campus in my opinion. It's really up to you and what you make of the partying scene like most of Gonzaga. If you're looking for a close friends group, outdoor activities, and a fair bit of tradition in a dorm I'd recommend it.",

They do camping trips, ski trips, climbing, white-water rafting, one big spring break trip. You get to choose what you want to go on so none are required. In addition there are hall events like BBQs, volleyball and badminton in the hall courtyard, movie/game nights, pizza and planet Earth, and a few others. And if there isn't a trip that suits your fancy most others in the dorm are down to plan and make their own trips too. I wouldn't let the distance be a stopping factor it's not too bad once once you get used to it. The main downsides in my opinion is you're a little less integrated in campus hence why Marian has a reputation of being a cult, but also everyone is a lot closer because it. The bathrooms are a little older than some of the newer dorms like Coughlin, but the sinks in the room, ample storage, and slightly bigger rooms are factors to consider.",

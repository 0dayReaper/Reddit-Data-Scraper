    "postText": "Hey, so when are we supposed to go line up? I live really close to McCarthey and I've been nominated by my friends to go first, but last two times I've been like an hour or more early and the line was already insane. This is my first year here and I will, indeed, bring actual camping equipment if someone just told me when should I go stand in line for those 10AM or 7PM ID times? Do I slog over with my coffee at 6AM for the morning ones? maybe right after class at 3PM for the 7PM ones? Thanks.",

Can someone please inform me if the lofted beds can support the weight of two people doing the frick frack?\n                        \nThanks in advance.",

When I was in a room with lofted beds, I had the bottom one and was, shall we say, insufficiently popular with the ladies to have any empirical evidence anyway.\n\nDon't do what my sophomore year roommate did, which is to just use my (bottom) bed instead.  Arriving back to my room to find him and a lady friend naked, asleep in my bed was rather an unpleasant surprise.\n\nOr if you are going to, at least, you know, put a sock on the door handle and wash the sheets afterwards.",

I mean, seriously, do you think any of the answers posted here will sway your decision when the time comes? In fact, you will enjoy it more if the loft does break because it will be that much better of a memory.\n\nNote: Some rooms have ceiling tiles (mine did). You can safely hide things there if needed.",

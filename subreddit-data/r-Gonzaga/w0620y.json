I highly encourage anyone to join if you want to try it it out. If you have any specific questions I would be more than happy to answer them for you.",

Though when I talked to him it was right before Covid so I never got to do a visit. But I did start rowing with the team day one and I was not with the people trying out. Though due to Covid I never got a signing day at my hs",

If you have 10 swipes, you can enter 10 times.\n\nBulldog bucks can be used both on campus on all dining places (panda express, The Bulldog, Sub Co.) but also at some places off campus (Pita Pit). (Side note, Bulldog Bucks aren't really worth it to buy unless they come in your meal plan).\n\nUnrestricted access basically means you can enter the COG as many times as you want. You have unlimited swipes for yourself.",

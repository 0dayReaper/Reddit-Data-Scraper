    "postText": "I am an exmormon. In the past few years I have spent a lot of my time online discussing mormonism. This has ranged from California's prop 8 debacle which tried to take away personal rights. It received a significant backlash and it has been recently reversed by the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. I also spoke out against Romney's candidacy for the White House on the grounds that it didn't seem sane for a person praying for the end of times (encapsulated cleanly in the church's official name, *Church .... of the Latter-day Saints*) to have his finger on control of a vast nuclear arsenal. \n\nWith that on background, a new issue has been coming to light and gaining some national attention [in the press this past week](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2015/10/07/scholar-boycotts-conference-brigham-young-u). It involves a university that is in your basketball conference, Brigham Young University. Their university requires mormons to remain mormon all during their academic career. This goes beyond behavioral controls, such as telling them not to drink, not to smoke, not to engage in premarital sex. A student who loses their faith and confides that fact to the wrong person may find themselves expelled. They may not be able to get their transcript to transfer credits, either. It's very puniative and does not foster academic freedom, in my opinion.  The schools faculty are held to the same standard, including aligning their beliefs with those of the church. The church's official position is not compatible with evolution, so a biology professor speaking too forcefully against two orginal people in a garden 7000 years ago, could be fired.\n\n**Question:** Are there any belief tests that students must adhere to in order to enroll in this university? Does everyone have to be a Catholic? At least a Christian? At least a deist? Is open expression of atheism allowed? Would those who lose faith face any threat of expulsion?\n\n---\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/3nvx6r/from_an_exmormon_does_one_have_to_be_a_catholic/) is my similar question I posed to the readers of  /r/NotreDame. My limited survey of religious institutions, especially secularly accredited institutions, shows BYU as unique in expelling apostates to their faith.\n\n",

BYU is a massively messed up school when it comes to how they treat their students or student athletes.  \n\nThe only religious requirement that I know of at Gonzaga is that you must take three religious based classes in addition to three philosophy based classes.   The options for those classes were varied when I went there to the point that I took a class back in the late 90s/early 00s taught by Jesuit priests on the contradictions in the bible.  \n\nGonzaga was a dry campus when I attended but that Elite Eight run back in 99 included multiple kegs being rolled by the wall and blessed by priests prior to them being opened.  At which point at least one of the priests engaged in a small amount of drinking with us.",

I was openly atheist when I went there from '04-'08, and I was an atheist when I applied (I don't recall whether it came up in the application process, however). You've got to take some religion classes, but you don't have to *believe.* Ultimately I think they want folks who fit within certain \"Christian\" ideals (e.g., charitable giving, social justice, etc.), but those students can fulfill those ideals non-theistically.\n\nThe Jesuits are a laid back group. As an atheist, I actually felt very welcomed by the Jesuit priests. Most of them had a sort of \"symbolic\" view of the Bible, too, so I was always amused when they'd argue with the students who were literalists.",

                                    "comment": "That may be, but BYU and BYU's Law School strive for accreditation.\n\nIndependent institutions aspire to accreditation by boards that indicate they're meeting the same sort of standards for academic freedom that they all agree upon. Parents want to send their children to universities which have accredited programs. Employers want to hire new employees from the pool of graduates from accredited universities. It's a chain. Yet, in my research so far, BYU appears to be unique in expelling their apostate students. They can follow all of the other behavioral rules (no drinking, no smoking, no premarital sex, etc.) but if their faith flags, then they're kicked out. It is a form of thoughtcrime/though control.\n\nIt is bad enough that students are tasked with these rules, just as their minds are opening to the world of thought found in post-secondary education. It is amplified because the faculty are tasked with the same sort of requirements. They must align their personal beliefs with that of the ownership, in this case, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. [A student has been expelled for being a feminist ally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt3hHkBrKLs). A faculty member's contract was not renewed after writing a letter to the editor against the church's behind the scenes dealings that led to Prop 8 being passed in California. The LDS canon includes belief of a [literal pair of humans in a garden approximately 7k years ago](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/3). The LDS canon includes the idea [that man will become a god and as such will live with his polygamist wives for the eternities](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132). Speaking out against any of these literal dogmas could lead to a professor being fired, or a student being expelled. Mormonism and science offer competing, not complementary views of the world. Some religions allow a more nuanced view, and there is considerable variability in mormonism. That variability is a bet that could lead to loss of earned credits, loss of employment and loss of pension. No wonder that people learn to hold their cards close to their chests.\n\nTo me, academic freedom means being able to investigate whether something contains the truth, or not. The opposite approach is when the avenues for investigation have roadblocks in front of them.",

The hall is on the quieter side from what I've heard, and is both sophomores and freshmen.\n\nMadonna is an all freshman corridor style, and has historically been social on weekends, but pretty quiet when people are normally doing homework. \n\nCoughlin is the newest building, but the application process can be pretty competitive. Each floor has a theme, like Leadership, Care of the Whole Person and Encountering Cultures. \n\nTwohy (pronounced TWO-eee) is similar to Goller, except it is not engineering themed. \n\n\nI hope this helped, let me know if you have other questions!",

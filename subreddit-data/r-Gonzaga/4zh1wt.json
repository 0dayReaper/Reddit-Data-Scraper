    "postText": "I followed the earlier post with interest and checked out the liberal/conservative opinions of Spokane on the /r/Spokane thread. My daughter (*does someone hear the whirring of helicopter blades?*) is considering Gonzaga and it is the only religious-affiliated school she's looked into. We both like what we've read/heard so far for the most part and are considering a visit.\n\nThe big question -- do atheists and lgbt students feel truly welcome on campus? Or is it more a matter of being \"tolerated?\" My daughter enjoys discussion and debate on various matters, but not useless screaming matches.\n\nWhat scared me was the mention of driving out 20 minutes and seeing Confederate flags around. On the Spokane thread, the prevailing wisdom was that Spokane's conservatism was of a more libertarian bent. I can handle that a lot better than the screeching fundamentalist bigots from the south where I grew up.\n\nIf she's walking around Spokane holding hands with a girlfriend would nasty taunts be likely? Dirty looks? Jealous side-long glances because they're such a gorgeous couple?\n\n**ETA: Thank you so much for all the feedback! Gonzaga is one of the schools my daughter is most interested in that she hasn't visited yet and I think it's definitely worth checking out.**",

There's an active LGBT presence on campus and many teachers are in the LGBT community. \n\nSpokane conservativism is definitely also lot more libertarian than it is actual religious conservativism. \n\nOverall yeah she'll fit in fine.\n\nOn the topic of the \"driving 20 minutes and seeing Confederate Flags\" you can do that in San Diego as well and that's perhaps one of the MOST LGBT friendly cities. I feel like most every city has that one area which are full of bigots, Spokane is no exception to it but you won't run into the people because it's nowhere near where college students would hang out.",

Can't really speak for the greater Spokane area, but even then everyone in Spokane is really quite nice and tolerant (especially of GU students).\n\nI can think of one lesbian couple that were particularly public with their relationship and affection, but I know for a fact there was like a LGBT week or something along those lines. \n\nDefinitely should not be an issue",

Never mind that she is an openly gay Rabbi teaching Jewish studies at a Jesuit university in one of the most conservative parts of the state. She was so awesome!

            "comment": "I'm an LGBT student at Gonzaga and to be honest I'd say to ignore people who are like 'I have gay friends and it's fine'. Personally I have a great group of friends and I'm really involved with LGBT stuff on campus, so I'm pretty lucky. However I know at least one person who transferred out after one semester due to the lack of diversity as well as the homophobia that they encountered. Last year a guy I know got beat up for going out on a date with another guy.\nIt's not all bad - Gonzaga is a great school but many of the professors don't care about homophobic comments in the classroom and I can't even tell you how many times I've heard LGBT slurs used casually throughout campus.\nThis sounds kinda bad, but I think it's important for you to know the truth. I've never personally encountered anything that made me more than uncomfortable and hurt, and we do have a community and support, but these things do happen.",

I think it's easy for people not in a minority to see things a little rosier than they really are (just a human nature thing, not that they are trying to give an inaccurate report). Wherever my daughter goes, she'll want to get involved with LGBT activities, which sounds like has been a real plus for you. I'm a bit worried about the casual slurs, and even moreso professors not shutting down homophobic comments. We probably will visit, and I'll certainly keep my ears open.",

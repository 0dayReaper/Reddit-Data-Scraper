Tell them Gonzaga is your top preference and why (even if it's a fib) and use offers from other schools as leverage. As students start to decline Gonzaga budget opens up and the financial aid offices will use their discretion to reallocate funds.",

Spokane is literally disgusting, crime ridden, and no school is worth the price they charge in this city. If you\u2019re gonna pay $$$$ you should go to a college that you\u2019ll enjoy in a place you\u2019ll enjoy. Check out ASU, UofA, high point, chapel hill, Ohio state, Dayton\u2026 idk. Think twice about Spokane\u2026 no bang for you buck at this school",

The whole city is like that. I couldn\u2019t really point you to area that i knew you\u2019d find trouble. But i also couldn\u2019t point you to a spot i knew you wouldn\u2019t find trouble. If you\u2019re trying to get away from same issues that have plagued Portland and Seattle in the last 10-15 years \u201cSpokompton\u201d is not the place. \n\nThe point i was/ am trying to get across is that for the price you\u2019ll pay to go and live here there are dozens of other similarly priced schools, where the cost of living will be the same or lower but more importantly where you\u2019ll actually want to spend your time. \n\nHere is some parting unsolicited advice/ wisdom, take or leave it. \n\nAs long as you go to an accredited 4 year university, no one really cares where you get your undergrad. The exception being that unless a school is considered the \u201cbest\u201d for an area or is an Ivy League, if you have to take a zillion loans it\u2019s not gonna be a good pay off. So go to a school you can afford and if there isn\u2019t one go to one that isn\u2019t going to saddle you with an ungodly debt that you\u2019ll never get out from under for a degree that is facially no different than the same degree from a different school. \n\nGo to a school that has lots of opportunities: look for things like clubs you\u2019re interested in, study abroad programs, largish student bodies, cool communities, good infrastructure etc, see who the alumni are and what they have done, etc. Those are the things that should influence your decision more than anything. \n\nPM if you have any other questions. I\u2019m happy to help anyway i can. I\u2019ve been through it a few times and have few degrees from different schools i know how shitty and scary this process is.",

Spokane is a very safe city from a statistics perspective. Yes, Gonzaga is in a low income neighborhood but that's what allows it to be affordable. I never felt unsafe but the entire west coast is facing poverty, income inequality, homelessness, and a drug crisis. Those factors are apparent in Spokane as well but the university does a good job creating a safe space and bubble and you can also avoid it if you're uncomfortable with the harsh realities of life in America right now.",

But you have made my point in your response despite saying that you disagree; a superficial bubble to shield you from this city is just not worthwhile. \n\nNot that it matters as this thread is dead, but crime in Spokane, specifically property crime, comfortably outpaces the national average. In relation to property crime in cities with similar populations as Spokane, Spokane has a vastly higher rate of property crime. (USnews, FBI NIBRS crime data). An interesting trend can be seen with regard to violent crime. Violet crime nationally has been trending upwards, what is interesting is that the increase of violent crime in Spokane is increasing at a rate greater than that of the nation; including the rates seen in cities with similar populations AND even other more populated cities. \n\nThe neighborhood immediately surrounding the university is \u201clow income\u201d in part because students live in the surrounding area. (North) That said, only the south hill and Literally certain blocks of Spokane and spokane valley are not \u201clow income\u201d at the very least they are not readily distinguishable from the low income areas. Again the statistics back this back this up, almost 20% of Spokane lives under the official poverty line. Poverty statistics are misleading as those who don\u2019t qualify as being below the poverty line may still not be food secure, or make enough money to live in conditions you and I would see as acceptable, healthy, or any other low bar.\n\nThe fuller picture is that by in large the homes not in those \u201cgood\u201d areas are rapidly deteriorating. Without regard to the occupants\u2019 SES, a great deal of people here live in homes that are in disrepair. (Trash in their yards, shingles and gutters missing from their roofs, siding falling from their homes). Certainly people here are not making enough money to make needed repairs to the places they live. In fact, i just read an article, i think maybe NYT, something like 15% of people in Spokane can actually afford the mortgage on average priced home here. (Slightly misleading, \u201cafford\u201d is ambiguous and might not literally mean have the  actual means of mortgage payment). Nonetheless you can\u2019t argue that even half of the people are thriving or even comfortable financially.\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading, the whole point i wanted to make with the OP was that for cost of school and living here, you can pay the same price and graduate in a place where you can afford a home and your neighborhood wont have houses that are literally falling apart in it. You can go about the community with confidence that when you leave your vehicle somewhere, upon your return it will have all its windows, wheels, and exhaust components. There is absolutely nothing inherently special or unique about Spokane. If you want to live an dumpy place where the half the people are disenfranchised insurrectionist and the other half are far left bleeding heart cancel culture liberals, Spokane is the place for you. \n\nThere are worst places but by god there are a load more good places\u2026.\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude44",

Eastern WA isn\u2019t particularly in line with many stereotypical CA attitudes\u2026 i would say come visit and just take a day to really drive around the city, don\u2019t just go up and down the main drags, go throughout the city and survey if this place your kid can see themselves living for the next 4-5years. I know my experience is not a truism for all students here. But Spokane is a love it or hate place in my experience. Everyone is different. My experience is undoubtedly shaped by my undergrad grad and post graduate employment experiences, mid west and east coast respectively.

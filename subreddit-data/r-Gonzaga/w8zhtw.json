    "postText": "I\u2019m coming to Gonzaga (out of state) as a freshman guy this fall. I have talked to my roommate a little bit via snapchat but other than that I really don\u2019t know anyone on or near campus. I have had the same group of friends throughout high school but I am pretty extroverted. A lot of my friends in high school were girls so I honestly haven\u2019t had to make any friends, but especially guy friends, in so long. I want to have that typical college experience with partying, but I am terrified about making friends and finding parties. Does anyone have ANY advice, tips, or just general information about the social scene at Gonzaga? I am living in Coughlin if that makes a difference! Anything is appreciated!!",

The big boon for me was during orientation where, as we were gathering for various events, I'd end up just introducing myself to people and chatting with them. Can't emphasize the club fair enough though, thats where I found the rugby team and the cheerleading team and I have friends for life because of it. Super excited for you!",

Join a club, it is imperative if you can't make friends in classes or in your residence hall. Without a club I fell into a haze of doing schoolwork and then immediately smoking weed, every afternoon. I never hung out or did anything as long as my work was done. You need something to keep your schedule busy and keep human interaction constant, because schoolwork doesn't take that long out of your day.\n3. Appreciate those friends that you DO make. I was very shy as a freshman and was extremely isolated but I did make one solid friend who I still cherish. I met him in small group and we kept talking forever after, and had many great times together. So even if you feel like your experience isn't going according to the movies or how you wanted it, just appreciate the things that you WILL get",

I remember the Club Fair was done every year and you could check out different clubs all in one spot :)\n\nEdit: does Coughing still have themed floors? There might be floor-specific events that are set up for people living on that floor, can't recall much though. I lived next door in C/M my freshman year lol",

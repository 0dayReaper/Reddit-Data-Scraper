    "postText": "For those who don't know, Campus Golf has been a favorite activity of many at Gonzaga. Players use a tennis ball and a beat up golf club and attempt to make it to a \"hole,\" usually a landmark of some sort, in as few strokes as possible. Maintenance staff apparently are concerned this is leading to an increase in divots in the grass areas around campus. Email from a member of Housing and Residence Life staff:\n\n&gt;Dear Resident,\n\n&gt;I hope you are all having a good spring semester and are gearing up for a relaxing spring break.  I am emailing you to let you know of an issue on campus that needs to be addressed.  There has been an increase in students playing golf with tennis balls around campus.  This has become an issue because damage is being done to the grass all over campus and we want to make sure our campus is as beautiful as it can be.  This damage to the grass is causing a significant amount of work for the grounds crew.  This activity also has the potential for injury to others.  The university needs this activity to stop immediately.  If you are found playing, you will be asked to stop and a Residence Life staff member or Campo.  You will also have the potential of going through the conduct process.  Thank you for your support in caring for our campus and those in it.\n\n&gt;Esther Gaines\n&gt;Associate Director\n&gt;Housing and Residence Life",

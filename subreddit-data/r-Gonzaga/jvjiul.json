    "postText": "Hey Guys,\n\nI am currently a Junior taking up Finance. I was wondering what you guys thought about the Finance department at this school as well as their prestige compared to other schools.\n\n I heard that if you don't go to a target-school that a Finance degree isn't the best option.\n\nI was also considering switching over to Accounting. How is the Accounting department at Gonzaga as well as its prestige?\n\nLast question, Accounting vs Finance. I want to hear your opinions!",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t say the finance program is comparable to places like Michigan or Penn but it does pretty well with placements at companies especially in Seattle. People who I knew during school ended up at places like Boeing, Goldman Sachs, and Zillow. A few people usually go to Wells Fargo every year and I knew some who worked at startups in Seattle, Portland, or the bay because that\u2019s what they wanted. \n\nNow for accounting, I would say they are comparable to those top schools in prestige and placement. Most end up at a big four or similar firm and either stay for awhile or pivot to a functional area somewhere else and tend to do well. I would be wary about switching now as a junior though since accounting majors usually need more credits than most business majors. They also need to typically sit for the CPA or CFA exam to continue their career so keep that in mind as well.\n\nOverall it depends on what you want. Does the prestige of going to a big four and working long hours for a few years intrigue you so that you can exit to something else? Or do you think working for a bank or large company in Seattle or elsewhere will be enough to achieve your goals? I think your answer will depend on what your goals are but chances are either degree could get you there just with different paths.",

            "comment": "Hey I'm a recent graduate with a finance degree from gu. If you're a junior then you're already almost halfway through the year and so if you switch to accounting you would have to add an extra semester or two to your workload to catch up. I would say accounting in general is a better program than finance but our finance program is good enough that if you go anywhere in the Pacific Northwest you'll still be able to find a job. I'm currently working in a private equity firm making about 70k a year right out of college. If I were you I'd focus on other ways to stand out like joining the bulldog finance club, doing the CFA competition or taking additional certifications",

While adding accounting will make you extend your time. \n\nIf you plan on staying within the PNW, you will be fine with either one. \n\nFor jobs and post grad: either one works. Post grad education I know the accounting program is ranked higher but finance is not far behind.",

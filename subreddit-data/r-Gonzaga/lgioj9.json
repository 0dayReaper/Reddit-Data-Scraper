Many of my friends are atheist, many not. I was definitely shocked by how religious some people were when I got there but it depends on who you surround yourself with. I went on the first year retreat my first weekend so I met and hung out with a lot of religious people my first few weeks. It was weird and honestly I didn\u2019t vibe with them. Found other friends and it was fine. The overt religiousness will pop up from time to time but it was no big deal. You do have to take three religion classes but only one of mine was about Christianity.",

There are so many programs available if you want to lean in here. \n\nI found that the majority of students consider religion a very small or non existent part of their experience. For me, the three mandatory religious classes were all very balanced and critical. We discussed both sides and there were outspoken athiests actively participating in conversation and doing well in classes.\n\nMy point is that you can be comfortable and excel regardless of which side of the spectrum you sit or if you're somewhere in the middle.",

    "postText": "...a friend of my daughter will be traveling to Gonzaga next year to play one of your key sports and become a part of your community.  I would like to get him a gift card to a local, fun place that the students enjoy.  I have done this for other people in the past and usually get a local ice cream or fun restaurant gift card.  I know the athletes probably get treated a bit different (and have the choice of things) but I thought it would still be fun to introduce him to a favorite, local place there.  Any suggestions?",

And the athleticism is truly special so that\u2019s saying something.  I mentioned athletics only because I know often get better things so I thought the students here could give me advice from a regular students perspective.  Thank you!",

            "comment": "Many options:\n\n\nFor ice cream, Froyo Earth is your best bet. That's a great spot, and probably that's what you're looking for. \n\n\nI used to like going down to the AMC movie theater down in Riverfront park, but that can be a bit of a walk. Plenty of stuff to do there, and that's what my family got me for Christmas/birthday/etc while I was at GU. \n\n\nBlaze pizza has gift cards, and that's a lot closer to campus. Wendy's and Chipotle are also near there. Kinda just regular food that's an alternative to the COG (dining hall), so probably not what you're after. \n\n\n\nFor \"late night\" food, Zips is a go-to classic. I don't know whether they sell gift cards, though. Also Sonic is near by, so that could be good.\n\n\n\nI'd defintely recommend Froyo Earth or AMC, depending on his preferences.\n\n\nP.S. Here's a hidden gem for you. I don't think they sell gift cards, but Pete's Pizza is delicious. It's good, hearty food that's not too expensive, and every time I've gone, everyone has had a good time there. I like their pepperoni pizza, but most people get the calzones, particularly the Sicilian.",

            "comment": "What type of local fun? All I see is food being listed. Also I have those recommendations as well. \n\nI think the best type of local fun is the amazing disc golf course kinda below the bridge into Spokane on the west side of the of the city. (The second most recognizable landmark in Spokane) My college buddies had cars on campus but this was some of the cheapest fun we could find. Also, I wish we discovered it sooner. \nDownriver Disc Golf Course\n(509) 363-5455\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/8V8p9fvHXW5GAzDq9\n\n\n\nI guess what I am suggesting are two gift cards, one to get him there and the other is to the ace general store near campus.  They have a lot of stuff in there; it has disc golf stuff there too. Not a big selection for disc golf but it\u2019s good to know it\u2019s there as a new student. It has almost anything you need for a DIY project or to fix your problem. \n\nThe General Store\n(509) 444-8005\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/xRwKre76xXCLNr53A\n\n\nLasstlyyy \u2014 I learned in criminology 101 that the local biker gangs used to float the drugs down the river. Till the local PD caught on and had a massive drug bust along the river. Kinda a fun fact that happened back in the day. Take criminology 101 as a elective, easy A, and the Professor was the man, he brought in his colleagues to discuss a day in the life of a cop. It was a great time.",

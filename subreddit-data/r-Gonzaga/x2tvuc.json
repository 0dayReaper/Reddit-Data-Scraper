    "postText": "I live near the trail, and feel it\u2019s important you know the danger you\u2019re in, when on the trail.\n\nThere are homeless people hiding in the bushes everywhere - with weapons.  My husband and I were chased while walking our giant dog, by a man with a machete - and it\u2019s not the first time.  People have pretended to pass out on the trail.  The moment you have walked FAR around them, they get up, and they, along with their accomplice (who was hiding in the bushes), wait for someone else to walk by.  Drug deals are a constant, the trail is littered with needles.  There have also been a lot of young men who\u2019ve ended up in the river, and it doesn\u2019t feel coincidental, especially if you\u2019ve lived here long enough.  \n\nIf you are going to use the trail, please be safe and aware of your surroundings.  Don\u2019t go at night, and if you have to, go in a group.  I have literally watched cars follow women, and only stop when they see me calling the cops.  \n\nSpokane is like any other city, it has its good, and it\u2019s bad.  The trail can be great, but I implore you to be safe.  I genuinely don\u2019t want find one of the students dead while I\u2019m out with my dog.  Please be safe.",

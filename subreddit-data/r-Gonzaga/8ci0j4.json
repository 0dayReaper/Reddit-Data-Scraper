Fill out the necessary information and you should be good.  I should mention this is for setting up a LAN connection, so you'll need an ethernet cable, but that's what you want to do anyway, because the school wifi is pretty shit, but the LAN isn't half bad.\n\n\nedit: lmao, just realized this post is 3 months old, that's what I get for never checking this subreddit.  Whelp, hopefully this helps in case you never figured it out.",

    "postText": "I I went to sleep and had a dream about being a Jedi vacationing on a beautiful plant as you do. The place I was staying at was kinda like the rope swing area we went to in the summer combined with the Colchuck Lake\u2019s lake/atmosphere. In the sky I saw multiple rainbows as if a toddler had a rainbow pen and drew a couple rainbow lines in the sky. They were crossing each other and looked terribly unnatural but the sky and the scenery was truly beautiful. As I look out into the view I vividly remember comparing the rainbow to a unicorn that just discovered molly for the first time with how chaotic the rainbow patterns were. And as I was admiring the view I saw the Terminator chopping some trees. The terminator was in his robo form (not Arnold Schwarzenegger). I for some reason thought \u201cthat\u2019s such a vibe\u201d and watched like it was goddamn anime with how entertained I was. After a while we made eye contact and the only way to describe the moment was as if I had just walked into a bank heist and made eye contact with the robber. As u tell, the tension was intense. He started chasing and I fucking forgot I was I Jedi. I deadass was trying to play ring around the rosie with a killing machine around a stump from a tree. I was looking at him again to see what side he would move towards on the stump so I would obviously go the other way as u do in ring around the Rosie and I guess in my calculations I didn\u2019t account for the fact he would pull out his cybernetic hand and shoot me with his finger gun. That just completely slipped my mind, my Jedi mind. As he shot me I realize I was in a dream.\n\nI had the feeling I had to piss so I got up the go take a leak. At this point I was awake but not really. It was still blurry because I just woke up and turned on the bright ass bathroom light. When I took a piss, some of the piss splashed onto the outer rim. Obviously if I was fully awake I\u2019d be Steph Curry in that mf, no way I\u2019m missing ofc. But because of the 20.04 patch where god decided to nerf me with the weakness to bright light, I faltered in this  moment. I wiped the toilet with toilet paper and washed my hands. I made my way back into my bed and I knew I was wide ass awake now after shamefully cleaning the toilet from my piss. I decided to check my phone and to my surprise I got an email from The University of Gonzaga. They made the process of seeing the update a bit more complicated then it needed to be by sending me a temporary password to login and find out what the update on my application was instead of just sending me the updated on the email like every other college. I logged in an lo and behold I got accepted to Gonzaga.",

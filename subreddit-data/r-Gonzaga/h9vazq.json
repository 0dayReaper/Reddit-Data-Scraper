If anyone doesn\u2019t mind me asking, what was their GPA, SAT/ACT Score, and EC\u2019s that got them accepted into the Nursing Program at Gonzaga? If you are not comfortable answering, it is perfectly fine. Thank you so much.",

However, I will say that provided you have competitive scores, Gonzaga is more concerned about the kind of person that you are than an arbitrary number. Spend extra time on your essay. You\u2019ll be fine.",

I played volleyball all four years of high school and volunteered one night a week at my local hospital. Personally, I think Gonzaga looks more for someone with a passion for nursing rather than their grades and statistics. If you show interest in the field by taking health science classes, applying for internships, volunteering, etc. it will give you an upper hand and make you stand out for sure. Don't forget to attend a nursing Friday in the fall. For me, that really helped solidify my interest in Gonzaga as well as get to know many of the professors.",

I don't have any specific insight in grades/stats, I don't think focusing on that during the application process, but if it helps to valid - my grades and test scores would seem to match /u/Downtown-Blueberry82.\n\n\nI would also agree with everything she/he said. Gonzaga is much more concerned with the Cura Personalis. I'd assume if you had competitive enough scores get into Gonzaga, you should continue to have competitive enough to get into the nursing program, but showing early interest in health science, volunteering, and a focus on the Jesuit ideals in an essay should see the deal. Most important thing is to show interest by contacting the professors, administrators that run the program. Ask questions, demonstrate interest. Allow it to be from a place of seeking to understanding for yourself if \"Is this the best for fit me\" - rather than \"How I can be the best fit for them (the program)\": this will impress them more than anything you can do.\n\nAlso, I am assuming you are a male. That will help, because diversity. And even if you don't think it does, as the only male in my graduating class, everyone will constantly remind you being a male is a big factor for why you secure a placement there. And it is. Own it. Don't let it diminish your accomplishments. But acknowledge it for what it is.",

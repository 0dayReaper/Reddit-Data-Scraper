            "comment": "The biggest draw to Gonzaga is the community. You WILL feel like a part of something here. Super easy to get involved with clubs, sports, or whatever. From the party scene (if you are into that) there are always parties and get-togethers on the weekends. Plus if you are a fan of basketball then this is the right place to be. Basketball is a crazy around here, even for those who don't like the hype. Its just fun.\n\nHaving been to a state school (two actually) before I transferred here I can tell you that with more than 10,000 students you'll be looking at a commuter campus. A little bit more difficult to find a niche. Sometimes you can feel like just a number. Now I don't want to bag on WWU because I know little to nothing about the school so take the above paragraph with a grain of salt.\n\nAnyway good luck deciding! If you do decide to come here, feel free to hit me up and send me a PM. I'll be more than happy to show you around :)",

            "comment": "I'll second what Ghostscript said.  Gonzaga has an absolutely fantastic community.  Every dorm has its own personality and everyone gets to know their hallmates.  The clubs on campus are large, enthusiastic, and have a family-like atmosphere.  You can't walk across campus without seeing at least one familiar face.  It isn't clique-y or divided at all (which is partially due to the lack of frats/sororities on campus), which I feel is pretty unique at a small university.  This community is what drew me to GU initially.  I walked on campus and instantly felt like I was at home and welcomed.  \n\nSmall schools are nice, too, because we have small classes of &lt;40 people and you can actually get to know your professor if you need/want to.  There are also tons of opportunities to do what you love AND get recognition for it.  For example, I'm an art major, and in my first year I've designed posters, painted decks for a student-run longboard business, and been published in the campus arts and literature journal.  \n\nAnother \"plus\" to GU is its location.  Yes, it is true that it's in a pretty ugly part of Spokane, but what's convenient about it is that you get all the benefits of being in a big city without feeling like you're in a big city.  The campus is about a thirty-minute walk along a pretty trail from downtown Spokane, where there's a mall, a movie theatre, and tons of restaurants.  There are three malls within a fifteen minute drive of campus, as well as a Fred Meyer, Target, Wal-Mart, and Costco close by.  Safeway is only about two blocks away from campus, as well, and there's fast-food joints EVERYWHERE in case you get sick of the dining hall food.   I've talked to friends at other schools, and many of them don't have access to so much so close to their school.   It's really, really nice.  \n\nAre you going to GEL Weekend this weekend?  ",

Ultimately, it's not about finding the \"perfect\" school, but finding the perfect school for *you.* Western is a good school, but I never felt the energy and love for a school there like I did at GU. I know a lot of friends that have gone to Western and slacked off a lot... Which, granted, happens wherever you go to college. But GU is the kind of place where you're surrounded by people who want to make themselves and their community better. It really helps you grow.",

Then go to WWU.\n\nIn all honesty though, while Western is a good school (I have quite a few friends there), you're not gonna find the same kind of community there (as others have said). Gonzaga, to me, does a great job of being a smallish private university (4500 undergrad), while still feeling like a big university, in the good ways. While you still have all of your classes taught by quality professors (not TA's), with class sizes at an average of like 20, yet with a consistently top 25 D1 mens basketball team backed by one of the top 5 student sections in the country. You still get that stereotypical great \"college experience\" here, if that's what's worrying you about small schools. I was also considering schools like Pacific Lutheran U and U of Puget Sound, but I'm glad I chose here for that reason, those two schools don't offer a college experience like GU does.\n\nWhat is your planned major?",

I want to look into geology, a program GU does not support. I really would like to go to GU, but I think it would be smarter for me to pick WWU. \n\nAnother small factor is I'm not religious at all, I'm sure God won't be shoved at me at GU, but just something im not use to at all.

    "postText": "I had to express how much I respect your program for a few reasons. First of all, congratulations on your first Final 4. I remember when you were underdogs making incredible sweet 16 runs. Second, thank you for being incredible to Kyle Wiltjer for the rest of his college career. He hit some big time 3's during our 2012 championship run. I missed him. Most of all, I just want to tell all of you how much I respect Mark Few. He was just on Mike and Mike talking about fly fishing for trout. There are few things I love more in life than fly fishing in the Northwest. He is genuinely an amazing coach, and amazing person, in my opinion. Congrats, and a lot of Wildcats will be rooting for you.",

You guys were just one shot away from the final four and played an amazing tournament, looking like one of the few teams capable of beating UNC right now. ",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a senior in high school currently considering Gonzaga and all my college\u2019s aid packages. I made a mistake on my FAFSA a while back, so I had to appeal my GU financial aid and received more money, but I\u2019m worried about the tuition increase. I like that my grants and scholarships won\u2019t decrease during my time at Gonzaga with the Gonzaga Guarantee, but that also means they don\u2019t adjust as the cost of attendance rises. Is this a big issue for current students? How do y\u2019all find ways to make Gonzaga more affordable? Also, is it realistic to be able to earn the maximum $4000 in work study in a year?\n\nThe aid package without loans that I received from appealing is decent, but I may need a few thousand more for it to be a feasible option. Any info regarding financial aid and cost would be appreciated. I\u2019m planning on studying accounting and doing the 5 year integrated masters in accounting program as well if that helps.",

            "comment": "During my undergrad studies there, the best  method of helping me cover costs was outside scholarships. Those really helped lower down the cost to where I only had to pay a few hundred or so out of pocket. \n\nAlso regarding work study, it should be possible throughout the year to earn the amount. Though this may depend on your job position and available hours. \n\nIt might be beneficial to talk to the financial aid advisors there. They might have some extra tips and knowledge.",

I\u2019m a senior and I haven\u2019t noticed much of a change. My buddy does a work study and he makes about $200 a month this year. I also know with COVID they\u2019ve cut hours but I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d go back to normal next year.",

            "comment": "In addition to appealing, you should also book a meeting with a financial aid advisor. Tell them Gonzaga is your #1 choice but it's cost prohibitive (or not competitive with XYZ schools offer). They will try their best to work with you. \n\nDon't hesitate to reach out multiple times. As students reject their offers a pool of scholarship funds may become available. \n\nI also found multiple niche scholarships online. Don't waste your time applying for big, competitive scholarships.",

            "comment": "One thing to remember is that you can still get more outside scholarships in your sophmore, junior &amp; senior years. That isn't going to be fun or easy but it might be your best shot if you want to graduate w/ only federal loans.\n\nMaxing out your work-study is pretty easy but IIRC you are only eligible for work-study for 2 years. So apply early to get a decent work-study job &amp; when you hit junior year they might bring you back as an institutional hire if they like you &amp; your work. Then you'll still have income for the last two years of school.\n\nAlso, being an RA will cut down on housing if you can stick w/ it for 3 years",

Got to meet a lot of people since just about everyone has to come through to get their books. \n\nMy only other comment is that if Gonzaga is your number one choice and you're ready to work hard then do it! I know there's plenty of need and merit based aide available for people who have shown theyre good students.",

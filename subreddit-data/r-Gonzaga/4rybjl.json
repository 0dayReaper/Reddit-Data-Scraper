It definitely doesn't have the appeal of dorms like C/M, Desmet, Welch, or Coughlin but it's a good place to be. Mostly freshman so there's a lot of friends to be made in close proximity. Haven't been in the bathrooms in Crimont but the whole of the building is a little older. Nice common room though for socializing. \n\nOverall it's in a good location and a good place for freshman. Just don't get stuck there as a sophomore. ",

It's got a ton of common room space and the basement has a ton of study space. \n\nThe best part is that it's halfway between main campus and the Logan so everything is always pretty close ",

                    "comment": "I can touch on the last two questions... It's a college dorm so it's not gonna be spacious by any means and learning how to share a smaller room than you're used to with another person is never easy but it's not horribly cramped. Your dorm room space is all about how creative you can get with organizing your desks, bed, and drawers. If you're concerned about space try to see if your roommate wants to bunk beds and order a loft kit asap. \n\nI know it varies for people but I'm of the opinion if you put yourself out there, talk to people, join clubs, and be social Gonzaga can be a pretty welcoming place and somewhat easy to make friends, no matter where you live freshman year. I know people who complain that Gonzaga isn't as inclusive as it likes to think it is but those are the people that really never leave their dorm rooms except to eat and maybe study. There are a variety of places and resources on campus to meet people who have similar interests. Those people might be in Crimont or might be in other dorms. Don't be afraid to make friends who live outside of your dorm. ",

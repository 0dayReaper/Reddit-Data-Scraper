I was thinking something active, but I am open to pretty much anything. If you've had a good experience with a low credit fun class let me know. \n\nThanks in advance!",

You can also take it anywhere you go. \n\nPlus it really helps reduce stress when midterms and finals come around.\n\nThe course name is EDPE-101 I believe.",

Both were very fun but I also had a good instructor, she kinda just let us do what we want as long as we were playing the sport. \n\nI also took beginners piano which was easy but that involved practicing outside class. I didn\u2019t live near the music hall so it was always a bitch to walk over there and I eventually just stopped practicing. \n\nIf this is still around, I\u2019d highly recommend the leadership class that goes to house of charity on Thursday nights with Sima Thorpe. You serve a meal and talk to clients, you then go to a room and do an activity or discuss important topics. It was one of my favorite classes I took.",

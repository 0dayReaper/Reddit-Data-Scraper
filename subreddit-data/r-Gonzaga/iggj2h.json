    "postText": "Okay, I just learned that if you have an onset of symptoms within the past 14 days, but they are normal and you know why they are occurring, do not enter them into the self check app. \n\nI originally reported three symptoms: Headache, fatigue, and runny nose. These are all the result of PMS and seasonal allergies, but popped up within the last 14 days. I received a notice to not return to campus (which totally freaked me out) and then got a contract tracing call this morning.\n\nThe woman who is on the contact tracing team told me to only enter in symptoms that I cannot explain or that are unusual for me. Anything that is normal for me should not be entered into the app.\n\nHope that will help some of you from looking like your COVID positive when it's definitely not.",

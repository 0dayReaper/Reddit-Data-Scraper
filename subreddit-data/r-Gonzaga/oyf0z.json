As far as integration goes, you will end up taking a at least 2 classes a semester with the same group of CS kids pretty much every semester. You tend to follow a certain curriculum for the most part. ",

Your CS coursework you will really enjoy even though it will take hours a week. Plus, unlike in High School, everyone is doing a lot of homework. You have a lot more time where you aren't in classes as well, so getting homework done isn't horrible. It's all about managing yourself. ",

    "postText": "Humbled Kansas fan looking to sell to sweet 16 tickets to Gonzaga fans who want to taste sweet victory, and celebrate with fans and team in epic Las Vegas.\n\nTickets will get you to both games - Arkansas vs UConn and Gonzaga- UCLA games this Thursday. Make your team the home team by joining the crowd.\n\nDad lives in Vegas and we are just trying to make our money back. Or best offer. StubHub keeps defaulting our ticket, listing out of search engine so,  \n\nHaving difficulty advertising them. \n\nWe will take BEST OFFER! DM me for info.  \n\nThis is the voice of the 80 something year old you saying, \u201c make me some memories. Go the hell to Vegas and give me moments then I\u2019ll remember the rest of my life!\u201d",

You\u2019ll see that it\u2019s the fastest selling nearly mid court view, seats, one and two, section 224.\n\n\nI will check back in about an hour and a half. \n\n\nI\u2019m just gonna take the best offer that I get by tonight or the first person to pay face value \n\n\nI\u2019ll look for the p.m.",

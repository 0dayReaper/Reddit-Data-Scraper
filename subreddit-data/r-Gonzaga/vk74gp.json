    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI\u2019m going to Gonzaga University for upcoming Fall semester and the dormitory only open on August 22nd so i want to rent an apartment outside instead of staying at the dorm.  I\u2019m trying to look for an apartment but i have been never in the usa before so it\u2019s a bit complicated for me to rent. Can anyone help me out to rent an apartment before arriving? I will study master, a girl and prefers renting a room in complexe houses.\n\nThanks in advance!",

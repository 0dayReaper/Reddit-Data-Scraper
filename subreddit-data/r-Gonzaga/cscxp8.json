We have a big kitchen, a living room with lofted ceilings, 2 bathrooms, 2 large sink areas, and a closet. Basically, there\u2019s a whole lotta space in Kennedy combined with amenities like an in-house bistro, a gym, a chapel, multiple study rooms etc. I love it.",

            "comment": "Kennedy is one of the closer options to downtown so it\u2019s cool to be able to just walk downtown, especially if you\u2019re 21. Also close to chipotle, Blaze, qdoba, zips, sonic, Starbucks, and several other places. If you don\u2019t have a car the bus stops right outside Kennedy to take you up division to the mall, Trader Joe\u2019s, and many other places. But also if you don\u2019t have a car it\u2019s pretty far from Safeway which is the closest grocery store, on the other side of campus. It might be hard to meet people though in Kennedy since you\u2019re new as it\u2019s a closed off community. It\u2019s also one of the newest halls on campus so everything is fairly updated.",

The front of the building looks nice, but the back looks like the architect lost interest half of the way through the design process. \n\nI really don\u2019t know why I care this much about a damn building but there was so much potential to bring the buildings of Gonzaga into the modern age and make the building look awesome.\n\nHave a good week!",

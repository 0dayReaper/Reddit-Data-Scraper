Can't get that elsewhere.\n\nIt's a traditional dorm, so you'll live with a roomate, and share a bathroom with your floor. You'll know everyone in the building and make good friends without too much effort.\n\nThe ronc is like desmet in that its all guys, but maybe doesn't party as hard. It really depends on the RA. Ours was our friend and didn't care.\n\nI lived there for year. Once you meet friends, feel free to move on to a more comfortable place with them, but comfortable shouldn't be your priority freshman year, meeting people should be. And that's easy enough in the ronc.\n\nThere are girls living in Lincoln right next door, and that is the ronc's sister dorm.\n\nWith any small amount of effort, the ronc can be a great place to live. To be honest, any dorm can. It's all on you.",

You'll know pretty much everyone in there and get really close to them. Places like CM and Desmet can be really overwhelming because of the sheer amount of people and partying that goes on. The ronc is more tame and in my opinion has a closer community due to the size.",

It's known as \"The Dirty Ronc\" because it's all guys and it doesn't tend to stay clean and tidy for very long (also lots of drunken sex with girls who don't mind the atmosphere and other dirty debauchery. You name it, we've tried it.) the whole place is built of cinder blocks, there's only 1 room with carpet that I know of, and the building is shaped like a big coffin, so that's weird... But you get used to it.\n\nOnce you move in, you'll probably get a visit from someone who lived there a year or two ago. Ronc alums love to visit the old stomping grounds and buy a case of beer or two for the current residents (ie you!)",

It's as close as Gonzaga gets to a frat in camaraderie, without any of the negative shit that goes with it. Five years out of college and the people I see most often are from the Ronc.",

I'm pretty sure my buddy is the RA in there next year so you'll have a good time. \n\nLike everyone else has said, makes friends freshman year, don't get to caught up on where you live. Explore all the dorms and make as many friends as you can. Enjoy being a freshman! ",

Personally I wanted the same thing going in freshman year, but I am so glad I was placed in Roncalli. Just like everyone else said the community in itself is really close knit and just some amazing people you get to know in there. Enjoy every moment.",

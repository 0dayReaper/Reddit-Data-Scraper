She immediately came on campus and starting taking away social events that were seen as part of Gonzaga student Life: namely tent City and welcome night. She took zero input from current students and refused to budge one bit. Essentially a pawn for risk management from the University. She had this ego that, I controlled USC I'm so high and mighty. \n\nShe mishandled the me-too movement and tried to suppress student activism on campus. Which is an extremely large and important part of the jesuit culture around campus. \n\nBy my senior year I had a hard time telling prospective students that I'd go to Gonzaga again with her in the helms. I absolutely loved my time there and it helped me become who I am today. But Judi was a funsucking bitch.",

In fact, this semester gonzaga is encouraging Spokane pd to give out mips to students as a more severe consequence for drinking or being at parties. Gonzaga used to be lit and Judy biggs is a major reason for its decline. Tenting is so ass now, campo is so not chill. It's honestly kreizy.",

The second a community member complained she would automatically assume responsibility and not look into it. Examples include shutting down DJ DeSmet for a semester because the one dumbass dude who lives across from hemmingsin would complain and it\u2019s like you\u2019re on a college campus kids are having fun and it\u2019s a Gonzaga tradition. She also shut down tour de logan a few years ago which I would honk was dumb because another Gonzaga tradition that doesn\u2019t really harm the community being taken away because a few community members complained. In general not looking out for students and kind of being a bummer. \nI did appreciate her emails around cultural appropriation around Halloween/Cinco de Mayo and I guess kind of trying to appease some issues. Overall she is not a student favorite",

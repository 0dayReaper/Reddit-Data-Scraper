It's big enough that there are always new people to meet, but you'll see plenty of familiar faces. The party scene still exists for those who want it, but it isn't a huge part of campus life since there is no official greek life. Also its a nice walk along the river to downtown where there's plenty to do if you are bored during weekends. Any questions, feel free to ask",

I will say that I LOVED my time at GU, and most of my friends are still the ones I met there, including my SO (my sister met her husband there too). For the most part I know very few people who disliked it, which is reflected in the fact that we have a VERY low rate of students who transfer out of the school. ",

It is tough though and they had to go through  a lot. They have great jobs now!\nAs far as teaching, I took one Special Education course (the first one, can't remember the name) and really hated how they went about it. The School of Ed is super entrenched in ABA, which I'm so, so morally opposed to. Their philosophies on teaching clearly differed from mine. My friend in the School of Ed mostly went into jobs serving underprivileged kids, so I'm not sure on the job front how competitive that is or if that was their goal... Again, other people most likely know more than me! The nice thing about so many required classes is you get a taste for what you like &amp; don't like... I was undecided and changed my major I think 4 or 5 times haha ",

The basic principle is that you tell kids that they're broken &amp; try to gently coerce them into displaying more normal behaviors... I'm against it for obvious reasons.\n\nBut anyway, yeah I think 2 people that dropped the program my roommates were in (I think 1 failed out). 1 went into business &amp; 1 went into I think Bio? Gonzaga wants you to graduate in 4 years, so chances are it'd only take an extra semester. Are you worried about committing when you don't think you'd like it? Or more about switching majors if you don't like it? If it'd be helpful I could connect you with one of my old roommates if that'd help you get a better, more honest feel for the program.",

You could always take some science classes and some education classes your first semester &amp; see how you feel then? I see why you say you don't want to commit. What I've seen is that people who REALLY want to be nurses make it, and those that don't maybe don't do so well. It's a difficult program &amp; if your heart isn't in it, it *might* not be worth it. Idk, talking to nursing &amp; education majors might be helpful!",

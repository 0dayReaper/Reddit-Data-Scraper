    "postText": "I have been accepted into the law school and I have no idea about the area. What should be on my bucket list while I\u2019m there in Spokane? I know it\u2019s a great place to go running, biking and such but I would like to know about some of the other aspects. I grew up in Alabama and went to a boarding school in a small town in Indiana. I attended the university of Alabama for undergrad/graduate school and I\u2019ve spent the past year in the D.C. area working professionally. I\u2019m use to small towns and large cities. I would love to know about the bars, are there any fun sports bars, dive bars, cocktail or whiskey bars? What are some of the apartments like? What are the best local restaurants and unique places around the campus/town? I\u2019ve spent some time in Seattle and have some friends there but I don\u2019t know anyone in Spokane.",

            "comment": "Congrats! Spokane and Gonzaga are both great places. Next to campus is jack and dans where most students go and hang out especially for basketball games. I know a lot of law students go to Logan tavern though as it\u2019s not as crowded and not filled with people who just turned 21. Downtown has a great bar scene. Hogwash is a whiskey den and a must go, volstead act is cool too. Zola is nice and hip and usually has a live band. Zola is also near a bunch of other bars perfect for some bar hopping including fast eddies, barrachos (great taco tuesdays and nice outside area for the summer), whisk, the riff (super divey), and usually end the night at the globe which has more of a club scene. \n\nBreweries are what Spokane is really known for though. My personal favorite is iron goat, it has great beer, nice atmosphere, quality food and live music sometimes. No-Li is right off campus, especially close to the law school. Beer and food are good but not like amazing, but it\u2019s popular for students and I like their outside area for the summer. Other ones I\u2019d recommend are mountain lakes, whistle punk (another personal favorite), south perry brewing and black label. \n\nSpokane has a cool food scene too. Right off campus is clover which is a hip more expensive place. My favorite place for a quick bite off campus is Clark\u2019s fork. Has really good breakfast and lunch. De Leon\u2019s is close to campus too and has good Mexican food, for Spokane at least. Some Spokane favorites of mine are Wisconsin burger, satellite diner(my favorite after the bars spot), Casper fry, Veraci pizza, Bangkok Thai and south hill grill. There\u2019s a ton of other places that are amazing, just what I could remember right now. The scoop has great ice cream. Hello sugar has cute mini donuts.\n\nSpokane is also known for its coffee but I\u2019m not an avid drinker so I\u2019m not as well versed there. \n\nSouth hill is the nicest neighborhood. Big houses with tree lines streets. It has manito park which is a must visit especially in the spring. South perry district is another popular neighborhood, kind of a small off shoot of the south hill. Kendall yards is across the river from downtown and has a lot of good restaurants, wineries, all with a nice view. Garland district is cute too, has a cheap movie theatre and the milk bottle, a diner shaped like a milk bottle. Getting out and exploring the whole city is the best way to get to know Spokane. \n\nSome cool events that happen throughout the year (though probs not this year cause of covid) are hoopfest, the worlds largest 3 on 3 basketball tournament. Pig out in the park shuts down all riverfront park in honor of food that is absolutely terrible for you. Spokane county fair is fun. Go to green bluff in the fall for Apple and pumpkin picking. I enjoy the Kendall yards night market every Wednesday during the summer. Terrain is an art collective that puts on a huge showing of art galleries all across downtown in October. \n\nSorry this was hella long but it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been able to talk about how much I love Spokane. Happy to answer any other questions you have!",

                            "comment": "Not the original commenter here, but also in terms of living, the 940 North apartments are a great place if you're looking for lodging. They may seem like they charge a lot at first, but if you are a single renter they have a pretty great setup where you dont need to have a set group of roomates, unlike many of the houses students live in around campus. They are also super nice and close. I've had a few family friends live there and said it was a good move. As for spokane, the music scene is also great. If you are into smaller bands, cover groups, etc., there are a ton of small venues around the area and occasionally the spokane arena gets some bigger names (if you can, see the Trans-Siberian orchestra, they come every holiday season. Never been, but my parents have and loved it). Spokane is quirky but cool. And for a day trip, try visiting Coeur d'Alene, idaho. Its about 40 minutes away and is a very nice area to go paddleboarding or kayaking on the lake, and has a decent downtown area. Good luck with studies!",

            "comment": "The Gilded Unicorn has modern American/gastro pub type food that is soooo so good if you\u2019re into that.  Our Thai House is right next to campus and has a student discount with ID (not sure if that\u2019s just undergrad or not).  There\u2019s also a number of great coffee spots.  My favs include Indaba, Arctos, Atticus, and Vessel!  Also Spaceman Coffee, Evans Bros, and Ladder.  The Satellite Diner is a must try.  The food is cheap and comes in large portions but it\u2019s good! And it\u2019s one of my favorite places to people watch.  It\u2019s a fun place to pop in for \u201cbreakfast\u201d at 12am lol.",

            "comment": "Downtown Spokane has a GREAT bar scene! Absolutely will always have a blast at the piano bar. Jack &amp; Dans is a must go but is also wildly populated by undergrads. I\u2019d stay clear of the bars on division downtown the bartenders call it \u201cbro row\u201d because that\u2019s where all the college students flock. Peacock Lounge inside the Davenport has a great happy hour and Sanarac is super good. I\u2019d also suggest making use of the admissions office and the law schools career and professional development office they can also give you tons of advice and they are all LOVELY people.",

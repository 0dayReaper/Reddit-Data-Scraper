I'm going to decide between either Gonzaga or Colorado State, but I have a few questions I hope someone can answer. \n\nIs the surrounding area of campus really as bad as some people make it out to be?\n\nIs it easy to make friends at Gonzaga (I will most likely be in Madonna my first year, is that a good choice)? \n\nIs the general environment of the school friendly?\n\nAre there a lot of activities on campus?\n\nIs there a lot to do in Spokane? (When I visited it seemed like there was a good amount of things to do)\n\nThank you...",

Good luck on your choice as I can provide no real advice on what the campus is like now thanks to the massive growth post the Elite Eight run in 1999.  \n\n\nI chose Gonzaga and never regretted it for a moment.  I loved it so much that I even stayed for a 5th year just to soak it all in (I really just changed my major from Sports Med to Comp Sci which meant I had enough core classes to graduate after 4 years but not enough major specific ones)\n\nIf you chose Gonzaga embrace all the campus has to offer.   That was the advice given to me when I first decided to go there and it was probably the best advice I could have been given.",

Now they do this in order to make you overly aware of what can happen. Basically the stuff that they want you to avoid doing is walking through logan at night drunk and by yourself, logan isnt the worst neighborhood but it isnt the cleanest either. Its becoming more and more college kids, but since it is a low income neighborhood you deal with some meth heads and drug users once in a while. \n\nI knew 3 other people when i got here my freshman year. I've made tons of friends from all over the place, living in c/m definitely helped with that, along with my job on campus. Madonna isnt a bad dorm, just depends on what you are looking for. If you want a quieter and more relaxed freshman year than madonna is for you. However, if you want the semi-typical college experience then c/m or desmet(if male) is the place for you. \n\nthe school is overly friendly and everyone genuinely loves being a zag. as a junior year it amazes me everyday of the people who I interact with on a daily basis, from my classmates, my friends, and even the staff and faculty. Everyone loves being a zag. \n\nGonzaga Student Body does a great job of on campus events to attend on the weekend, just have to make sure you know how to sign up for them and know when they are. Intramurals are beyond big for the students, ranked top 10 in the nation. \n\nLots of stuff to do in spokane, down town has great dinning along with a mall, movie theater, concert venue, and all that jazz. I've really come to love spokane and the surrounding area. \n\nif you have any further questions please let me know. \n\nI highly recommend participating in GEL weekend, its a preview event where you can meet plenty of other future and current zags. and overall awesome weekend that made my decision to select gonzaga.

Its pretty easy to make friends, all you have to do is try to get involved in activities that interest you (there are a bunch of groups on campus that you'll learn about early in the year with the club fair). I haven't lived in Madonna, but from friends I've heard it's nice enough for a dorm.\n\nIn general, everyone on campus is friendly. It's gonna be difficult to go a day without someone holding the door open for you.\n\nThere are quite a few activities on campus, as well as Spokane (such as the Chiefs, the local hockey team and movies, plays, musical performances, and the like).\n\nWhat are you planning on studying?",

            "comment": "Graduated from Gonzaga in 2013, and now I am at CSU for my masters, so I may know some things...\n\n1, the Logan neighborhood wasn't that bad, and feels pretty safe considering there are a lot of students that live in that area and campus police + Logan police do regular patrols. Plus, if you walk in the other direction for about 10 min, you hit downtown Spokane, which is absolutely  beautiful from late spring to early fall! And its not too bad during the winter either!\n\n2, the absolute best four years of my life were at GU! The friends I made during my first year I still remain incredibly close to. They are the ones I studied with, the ones I hung out with on late nights doing absolutely nothing yet having a blast, the ones I partied with, and the ones I miss everyday. What was so awesome about GU was you could literally walk 10 min across campus and BAM, you were at your best friends' place. Friends and memories made were what made Gonzaga so special and nothing has made me appreciate GU more than realizing I can't just walk 10 across campus to see my best friends :P\n\nNow that I am done reminiscing, of course, there were those few people who transferred, but for the most part most students have no problems at all making friends. And the beauty of GU is that you don't have to make friends with students in your dorm, my best friends were the kids in my major field, my work-study coworkers, and the people I met during pre-orientation programs! (Seriously consider doing one of the pre-orientation programs if you get a chance!). So it really doesn't matter where you live, friends will come from everywhere!\n\n3, SI! Not only is the student body awesome (you will be saying 'hey!' very often as you walk through Crosby or the COG (cafeteria now, the COG is no more :P)), but the professors are awesome too! I still keep in contact with my  academic and thesis advisors and make an effort to see them when I am in spokane! Not sure if this is the same for all major fields, but for the chem and biochem dept, I felt like all professors really cared about the students and their well-being!\n\n4, On campus, the gym kicks ass, the intramural field kicks ass, and there are clubs for whatever you may be interested in! I found it was less about what you were doing and more about who you were doing it with.\n\n5, Yes, and one thing I regret was not getting out more. Downtown has a mall, movie theater, restaurants, bars, etc. Near campus there are also some good eats (bangkok thai has the best pad thai, literally blows anything I have had in Denver and Ft collins out of the water), and what is essentially Gonzaga's official bar (Jack and Dans). There is also a great running/walking path along the spokane river near campus, and if you are into it, the surrounding area is home to lots of great rock climbing, skiing, hiking, etc. It wont have as much as CSU has in this dept, but it can compete.\n\nFinally, things to consider, Gonzaga is private which equals $$$, unless you are not from Colorado so the out of state would also equal $$$. However, for the friends and memories, I'd do it again :) I don't have as much to say about CSU as graduate school is not the same as undergrad, other than if you are outdoorsy and from Colorado, it might be a better deal.\n\nGood luck, and if you have anymore qs, I'd be glad to help :)\nGo Zags! Go Rams! But mostly, GO ZAGS! Still proud of this season no matter what!",

            "comment": "I had the same concerns about the city. One thing that sounds silly, but turns out too be a plus is that Spokane and Gonzaga have a GREAT relationship. GU spends so much time in service to the surrounding community and the community rallies around the school creating a very friendly environment-- almost even small-town-esque. Spokane is surprisingly beautiful, especially around the river and the falls, but to be honest, I don't go out into the city much. Spokane gets great concerts, and my roommate has gone to multiple, but there is so much to do on campus that it is hard for me to find the time to get off. Madonna is a good decision. I would also suggest considering DeSmet if you're a guy or CM (coed). Just try not to live in a suit or apartment your first year just because it is easier to branch out in a hall. And oh my gosh, it is hard to go to class without saying hi to someone. I truly believe Gonzaga is one of the best colleges for simply making friends and enjoying the simple company of others. I was about to post this video, but I think I should also show it to you here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4oDomV01lw&amp;feature=youtu.be\n(This is a video my friend made for a project in a leadership class called CLP)\n\nGo Zags and best of luck on your decision. Honestly, there is no right answer and you will find happiness wherever you go. I just love my school and really want to share that\n\nSource: Freshman at GU",

There is a bit of crime in the Logan Neighborhood (the neighborhood directly north of the school where most of the upperclassmen live), but nothing too bad.\n\nYes, very easy to make friends.  Madonna is great, you'll be living next to a couple hundred other freshmen all looking to make friends as well, and C/M is right next door with a few hundred more.\n\nYes, the general environment is friendly. \n\nActivites, plenty.  There are multiple university sponsored events every weekend, as well as throughout the week.  There's always something going on.\n\nSpokane, yes.  If there's nothing happening on campus (which there always is), there's quite a bit to do in/around Spokane.  Downtown is great, the Spokane Arena usually gets touring performers to play a show for Eastern Washington/Northern Idaho/Western Montana. If you're into biking/jogging, Centennial Trail runs right by campus along the river and has great views. There's a few ski hills within 2 hours.  Lake Coeur d'Alene is 30 minutes away.  Riverfront Park (about a 15 minute walk down the Centennial Trail) in the middle of downtown has events quite often, as well as an IMAX theater and an ice skating rink during the winter.",

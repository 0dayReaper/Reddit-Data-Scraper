I prefer using hex bar over traditional deadlift and so I was wondering if the college gym had it. Thank you! Also, is the gym nice?? what do yall think?? is it always busy?? I go to the gym everyday for an hour a half to two hours and so I want to know if the gym is good.",

I have pretty good luck going early in the morning or during times of the day when most of the student body is going to be in class and I have a break. Even when it\u2019s busy though there\u2019s usually still stuff open, you may just have to wait a bit for one or two machines or racks.",

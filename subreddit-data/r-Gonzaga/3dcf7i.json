    "postText": "Zags,\nI am a recent grad from the KU Medical Center in Kansas, currently working near the Seattle area.  I am heading over to Spokane next Tuesday for my Physical Therapy Board exam on Wednesday.  I just had a few quick questions, and I figured as a recent college grad, I could trust the Gonzaga subreddit more than r/Spokane.  \n\n1) I am taking the exam in the Northern part of town, but I want to stay closer to the University, because after my exam I definitely plan on going out to clear my mind after the most difficult test I have ever taken...  So where can I find a somewhat reasonable hotel near the bar district? \n\n2) Speaking of the bar district, for my first time in Spokane, and first time chilling with Gonzaga students, what bars should I go to on a Wednesday night (or even Tuesday night to eat too?) I've heard good things about Fast Eddie's and Jack &amp; Dan's, but as students/alumni I'm thinking you guys would be able to point me in the best direction.  \n\n3) What are some things I need to be sure to do while in Spokane? I am a huge basketball fan, (Sorry all, I'm a Jayhawk. However, a Jayhawk with no beef against the Zags, got mad respect for your program!) Anyways, as a basketball fan I wanted to at least see your arena on the outside, or inside if possible! I also heard something about some falls? If anyone could give me some more info on stuff I need to do it would be awesome!\n\nMuch love from a new PNW resident Jayhawk! Thanks!\nAlso, if any of you would want to grab a few drinks, I'm definitely down to meet some new people on my trip! ",

The blind buck, across the street from Fast Eddie's is good too, as is boraccios (spelling) which is down the street. For food, Waddell's is a place that's a 10 minute drive from the U district, but is the best place to eat in town by far, with about 40 different beers on tap. Hopefully this helps you somewhat",

            "comment": "Welcome in advance to spokane! It's a very underrated city in my opinion.\n\n1. There's tons of hotels very close to Gonzaga's campus, many of which you can get a decent rate at. a good middle of the road hotel as far as I know is the Red lion. There's the red lion on the river which is practically on gonzagas campus or there's the red lion at the park which is about a half mile west of that.\n\n2. Im not 21 so I don't know much about the bars, but Barrachos has 1$ tacos and 2$ beers on Tuesday. I know plenty of people go there regularly for taco Tuesdays.\n\n3. The falls are beautiful, if you can, go to Anthony's restaurant and get a table outside. Their deck overlooks the falls and it is gorgeous. I don't know if you can get into the McCarthy Center at Gonzaga to see the facility, but you can certainly drive right up to and walk around the outside. There's some lovely parks around Spokane too, like Manito park on the south hill.\n\nHope this helps!",

It's fairly small and depending on the time of day you might get a peek inside the arena.  You will be able to walk the halls.  Campus is very near downtown, where there are a lot of bars, the mall, and you can walk around Riverfront Park which is fairly big, has an IMAX, a carousel and it follows the river up to Spokane Falls.

That's the happening spot to be. there are four bars on the block of Fast Eddies that are all really nice and pretty fun, usually someone will be having a 21st birthday at one of them. And if you're looking for a cheap place to stay, PM me and I can set you up.",

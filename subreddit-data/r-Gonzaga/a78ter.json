    "postText": "Just wanted to share the statement President Thane McCulloh sent to the student body regarding the recent scandal with Jesuit priests being sent to Gonzaga after having been accused of abuse:\n\n\nI write today in light of a recent investigative report entitled, \u201cSins of the Fathers.\u201d The account first focused on the horrifying, predatory sexual abuse of Alaska Native girls and women by James Poole, a Jesuit priest who worked at\u00a0that time in Nome, Alaska; and then examined the ways in which the leadership of the Society of Jesus knowingly re-assigned men such as Poole \u2013 as well as numerous other men credibly accused of sexual abuse \u2013 to other locations within the Oregon Province,\u00a0and sometimes to locations where they were\u00a0again\u00a0credibly accused of abusing children, women and men, and vulnerable adults. Through her research, the reporter further found that many men who were accused of sexual abuse were in their later years assigned\u00a0to the retirement facility and Infirmary for the Oregon Province, Cardinal Bea House, located just west of St. Aloysius Church.\n\nListening to this broadcast and reading these accounts is deeply disturbing and elicits for me feelings of sadness, disgust and betrayal that I know must be shared by all of you as well. I feel so much sadness and anger for the women,\u00a0men and children who were victimized by Poole and others, and all those who have been sexually assaulted by ordained priests who abused their power and privilege. I, together with fellow colleagues and friends of the University, were deeply wounded by the\u00a0revelations of the sexual abuse of children, men, and women by Jesuits of the Oregon Province that were at the heart of the Province bankruptcy (filed in 2009, with a settlement reached in March 2011).\n\nThose wounds for me were re-opened this weekend, at the revelation that the Society of Jesus had knowingly sent a man with Poole\u2019s record of sexual abuse to live in their facility within the parameters of our campus \u2013 which serves not only\u00a0as the home of college students, but regularly hosts grade-school children and visitors of all ages \u2013 without notification by the Province to the University. Cardinal Bea House is owned and operated by the Jesuits West Province (i.e., not Gonzaga University).\u00a0It has served both as a center for formation of Jesuit novices and as a residence for retired Jesuits (until the present). The Province determines the assignment of its Jesuits to its communities, such as Cardinal Bea House.\n\nIt is important for me to share with you, that in the years following the 2011 Oregon Province bankruptcy, I learned that there had been priests under supervised \u201csafety plans\u201d living at the Jesuit retirement community (Bea House). It\u00a0was not until 2016, when the Province chose to begin relocating a number of retired men to the Sacred Heart Community in Los Gatos, that I learned that among them were Jesuits who had been on safety plans (and were moved). The first notification I had that\u00a0Fr. James Poole lived at Bea House was when the US Jesuits West list was released on December 7th, 2018; I did not know of Fr. Poole, or his history in Alaska, until the investigative report aired this past weekend. Following the lessons learned\u00a0out of the bankruptcy, I had relied upon the Province to inform us of any Jesuit whose history might pose a threat to our students or campus community. I deeply regret that I was not informed of the presence of Fr. Poole, nor any other Jesuits who might pose\u00a0such a danger, at Cardinal Bea House.\n\nThe University is not aware of any reports of abuse or misconduct involving retired priests during the time they were living in Cardinal Bea House. Today, I reaffirmed with the Provincial that there are currently no Jesuits against whom\u00a0an allegation of sexual abuse has been made living at Gonzaga University, Della Strada Jesuit Community, or the Regis Community at Cardinal Bea House. Further, I have asked that we be guaranteed that no Jesuit against whom credible allegations of sexual misconduct\u00a0or abuse have been made ever be assigned to Gonzaga or the Jesuit communities here.\n\nWe are committed to being a community that strives to respect, protect and support every individual. As such, the safety of our students, staff and visitors to the Gonzaga campus is our top priority, and the University has zero tolerance\u00a0for sexual misconduct of any form. Gonzaga has measures in place to allow for confidential reporting of misconduct to the proper authorities at\u00a0www.gonzaga.edu/report. It is University policy to cooperate fully with any and all investigations of abuse and to take swift action when warranted.\n\nPlease know our\u00a0Center for Cura Personalis,\u00a0Health and Counseling Services, and\u00a0Office of Mission and Ministry\u00a0are resources dedicated to helping our students work through complex issues such as this. For employeesstruggling with these same feelings, the free, confidential\u00a0Employee Assistance Program\u00a0is available. Further, I encourage anyone who has been victimized by a Jesuit to contact both Mary Pat Panighetti, advocacy coordinator for Jesuits West, at\u00a0408-893-8398\u00a0or\u00a0mppanighetti@jesuits.org, and appropriate law enforcement and child protective agencies.\n\nEarlier this fall, I communicated Gonzaga University\u2019s\u00a0commitments\u00a0to our students and community (https://www.gonzaga.edu/about/president-leadership/messages-media/2018/ongoing-revelations-of-abuse-in-the-catholic-church).\u00a0This message also appears in the current edition of the Gonzaga Magazine, arriving in homes this week.\u00a0\n\nFully repairing the pain of abuse may never be possible, but we must be and remain committed to continuously love, support and care for those who have been victimized, and resolve to seek justice with and for them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSincerely,\n\nThayne M. McCulloh, D.Phil.\n\nPresident\n\n",

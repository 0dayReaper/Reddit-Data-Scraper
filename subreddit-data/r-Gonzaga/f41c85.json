Also said that 156/185 waitlisted students got in last year so I'm just wondering my chances for this year. Thanks!\n\nEdit: I GOT IN!!! See y\u2019all in the fall!",

And even if u don't get in some of my friends here got in off of appealing their denial and then got let in. Lots of rescinded applications get appealed every year.",

If you also have some recent accolades, send them as well because it helps increase your chances. \n\nI got deferred and what I did was I sent multiple letters saying I wanted to come here and because of that, I was able to increase my chance. \n\nIf there is an organization you want to work with at the university I.e Debate, reach out to the director, see if they like you and if they want you, they will try their best to have you on the team and entered the university. \n\nI do hope you can get in.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm an incoming law student at Gonzaga and I'm looking for advice for housing/moving to Spokane. I'm from SoCal and went to undergrad in NorCal so moving to Spokane is a big step for me (I already know I'll hate the snow lol). Couple of questions:\n\nWhere is the best place to contact people for housing? I've browsed the housing webpage on GU's website but it seems pretty empty. I've also found some Facebook groups but I'm not sure where is the best place to start. \n\nIs a car necessary? How is the public transportation situation?\n\nWhat is Spokane like? Based off browsing Reddit it seems like a cool place with great food spots.\n\nI'm a POC and I'm wondering what the diversity is like in GU and Spokane area? Is there access to markets geard towards more ethnic foods?\n\nHow safe is Spokane? Can I walk around by myself at night (I'm female-presenting) and be relatively okay?\n\nHow bad is the weather? I already know I'm going to suffer in the snow but how prepared should I be for it?\n\nThanks guys! Super excited to attend school!! (And if any incoming 1Ls want to connect hit me up)!",

            "comment": "1. Facebook is the best if you want to find a house in the neighborhood with other students, many of the posts will be from undergrads though so may be harder to find other law/older students. \n\n2. Car is not a 100% necessity but very nice. Publix transport kinda sucks but usable. I took buses to the mall, downtown and other places when I went there, just has to be planned out as buses only come like every 20 minutes. But there\u2019s a Safeway near campus and the Logan is walking distance from downtown which is where you\u2019d probably spend a lot of time hanging out outside of campus. If you\u2019re outdoorsy though you\u2019ll want a car as hiking and other such activities are out the city. \n\n3. Spokane is cool. Very different from California, Bay Area native here. It\u2019s a lot smaller than what you\u2019re probably used to. It\u2019s a cool city though, great breweries and good American food. You will miss Asian and Latin foods though, just doesn\u2019t compare. Downtown has some cool stuff, the park downtown is awesome, manito and the south hill are pretty and there\u2019s other cool neighborhoods to explore. There\u2019s some fun events that go on in the city too, hoopfest, bloomsday, porch fest, pig out in the park and more.  There\u2019s less stuff going on in the winter though so you gotta make your own fun then. \n\n4. Gonzaga is fairly white, Spokane feels whiter. There\u2019s definitely some weirdos at Gonzaga but the overall campus and community are great at Gonzaga and very welcoming. The school isn\u2019t perfect though and most of my poc friends loved it but most had some gripe with the school as did I. Cultural clubs are super awesome to get involved in and meet other zags of your background. The areas around Gonzaga are pretty cool and the more liberal areas of Spokane especially as more younger people move into the downtown areas. The further you go out the more racist it gets. Northern Idaho has a lot of white nationalists, look up Matt shea of spokane valley, total human garbage. So there are a lot of very racist people up here but not everyone is and your chances of anything happening to you are probably very low. There are very few ethnic markets in Spokane. Maybe a couple Asian and a couple Mexican markets but nothing like you\u2019ll see in California. \n\n5. Spokane has very high property crime and also has a pretty bad homeless situation. Being from California though it\u2019s nothing like skid row or the tenderloin in sf, you\u2019ll definitely see tents and a few people walking around very drugged up or experiencing mental health issues. Whether that\u2019s an issue to you is up to your tolerance. I always felt very safe in Spokane though and I walked around alone all over at many times in the night, I\u2019m a big guy though so I feel I can hold my own and I look intimidating. \n\n6. Winters are rough. The first snow is awesome. But having snow on the ground January to March really sucks and was hard to adapt to as a Californian. Its nothing compared to the east coast and Midwest though so I just always told myself at least I\u2019m not there. It\u2019s all so worth it too when you have that first warm day of spring. Everyone\u2019s out hanging on campus and it really feels alive. Summers get really hot here too so be prepared. Fire season is also an issue like in California.",

If you\u2019re cold at 65 you\u2019re gonna be real cold there but your body will adapt. \n\nI have no clue honestly but most people won\u2019t know anyone going in so you won\u2019t be alone. You may just have to wait till orientation to meet people. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re screwed, I still see people posting on the fb page looking for roommates to live with, there\u2019s still spaces out there!",

            "comment": "Not a Gonzaga student, nor was I ever, just follow the sub for sports\u2026but I\u2019ve lived here my whole life. I\u2019ll answer what I can. \n\nGonzaga geographically sits just outside of the downtown area, in the U District, which gives you access to a supermarket, loads of great food options, or a short Uber ride to tons of options. There\u2019s the Spokane Transit Authority (STA) which is our bus system, and it\u2019s covers just about all parts of Spokane and Spokane Valley proper. A bicycle can be handy too! \n\nSpokane is amazing as it has a good variety of things. VisitSpokane.com is a terrific site with great info on these types of things. And food options are great, tho ethic diversity in food I can\u2019t comment on since I\u2019m simply not very diverse in what I eat, I\u2019m a stay at home kind of guy.  The best place to find this info is the Spokane Food Finder group on Facebook!! Ethic markets I also don\u2019t have much knowledge on. Again, Spokane Food Finder would be my go-to source! \n\nSafe is so subjective, and you could find tons of different war stories if you want to find doom and gloom, but I feel it\u2019s safe. Spokane was ranked the number 1 place to raise kids back in 2007, which can\u2019t be bad. Our home prices are in the top 10 for price hikes which has increased our homeless population. I feel it\u2019s like other big cities and common sense applies. Situational awareness always!! The campus itself probably has more foot traffic than other areas, and probably safer than other places. \n\nWeather is all four seasons, with this year being harsher than normal. Roughly 10-20 days over 100 with a dry heat in the summer, which can bring some smoke from\nWild fires. Relief from the heat in fall with beautiful color changing in the trees is great, but shorts weather ends about October. Winter is snow, generally around December/January but snow offers tons of fun with 5 ski resorts within an hour drive. Have gloves and a beanie with a warm coat and boots, and you\u2019ll be good! The city is mostly used to snow so I feel they handle the streets and sidewalks better than other places. Bundle up in layers. \n\nI love Spokane, tho I may be biased. I spent some time traveling in the military and found Spokane to be a great balance of big city feel without being insanely populated. Rush hour is lighter than a lot of places, but worse over the last two years with people moving here out of Seattle. There\u2019s 12 lakes within an hours drive for summer fun! Hiking, camping, outdoorsy stuff. You can ride a bike all over town for getting around. Good entertainment, Riverfront park is cool, the \u2018centennial trail\u2019 is 60 miles of bike/walking path through most of the county, list goes on and on. Restaurants are great, and Jack n Dans is a Gonzaga school icon! Downtown has TONS of options, and isn\u2019t super far, but would be a long walk. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s what you make of it. There\u2019s a little something for everyone.",

            "comment": "1. Housing- join the Facebook groups. There's one that requires you (or required when I was a freshman) to connect your GU email to your GB account to ensure only GU students were joining. Ask around, especially in the Free &amp; For Sale group. If you're still struggling, contact the GU housing office/Housing and Residence Life  - they may be able to get you in contact with some students looking for housing/roommates!\n\n2. Vehicle- convenient but not necessary. Student ID allows for free usage of public transportation which is mediocre at best. It's pretty easy to find people with cars who are willing to drive you places though (there's a carpool Facebook group) and a lot of Spokane is walkable (15-20 minute walk to downtown from campus). I would recommend a bike. There's a good bike shop downtown. Invest in a good bike lock and register your bike with campus security- they'll also register with the police station and IF a bike gets stolen, they're supposed to send serial numbers to every used goods store in the area to keep an eye out for it. \n\n3 &amp; 4. Spokane is a beautiful city with lots of walking and bike paths as well as parks and gardens. Lots of great food places and caf\u00e9s to study at. Decent amount of events in the area for entertainment. Spokane as a whole is pretty conservative, the University and downtown area tend to be more liberal and focused on connecting with and educating people about the history and roots of Spokane and the Spokane tribe in the area. Spokane is pretty white, but GU has clubs to help POC connect with other POC and educate others about their roots (Intercultural Student Union and the Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Club are the two that come to mind, I had friends in both clubs and their events were a ton of fun! I believe there are others too, I just dont recall the names off the top of my head). Spokane also does have a few ethnic markets- DeLeons is a Mexican market and I know there's an Indonesian market somewhere and I think there's a Ukrainian one too. There are also a handful of Halal markets in the area). Be sure to visit Kendall Yards, the Perry District, Manito Park, and Greenbluff!\n\n5. Safety - Spokane has a homeless issue; many of the homeless have mental health and/or drug issues. There are city programs working to address the issue but there's only so much they can do. It's nothing like SF/NorCal but it is a visible issue. Most of Spokane is safe, but there are a few places I, as a female, would not recommend walking to/through alone after dark but are fine if you're with a group - most upperclassmen and grad students can give you more details when you get to campus. To be clear, the areas aren't necessarily dangerous after dark, just super sketchy (I've had people persistently cat call and hit on me, one time a dude biked up to me and repeatedly asked if I was \"old enough to legally fuck\" him). There are also a few bars I wouldn't go to alone (namely The Globe - I've heard too many stories of single women getting drugged there). Spokane also has a bit of a theft issue, just lock your doors and don't leave valuables in sight in your vehicle and you should be fine. Sign up for ZagAlert - you'll get a notice when someone reports a safety issue in the area (I've gotten them for purses stolen, break ins, SWAT and police vehicles in a condensed area, power outages, snow days, etc.). \n\nTo reiterate (mainly for the moms reading this as they're preparing to send their kids to GU for their freshman year), the vast majority of Spokane and the surrounding areas are incredibly safe and clean; as with all cities, there are a few places that aren't great for single women after dark. There is always power in numbers, just learn to trust your gut and get somewhere safe. Save Campo's number to your phone - they WILL drive to pick you up if you're unsafe. They are a campus police force, not just campus security guards, and their job is to ensure all students are safe and accounted for.\n\n6. Weather - Spokane is cold in the winter but doesn't often get below zero. Get waterproof boots, wool socks (Costco sells great ones), and make sure to wear lots of layers! 30 Below is a great brand for a base layer, be sure to also get a good outer layer (I'd recommend a combo outer layer of a down puffy jacket and a rain coat/windbreaker - Eddie Bauer, Columbia, and REI all sell systems like this. I live in MN so I was able to get my current combo in the middle of the summer on clearance one year, you may be able to find good deals if you shop now-ish. I prefer the combo because you get 3 levels of warmth - the base coat for autumn when it's chilly but hasn't snowed, the full combo for when it's snowy and cold/windy, and the rain coat for spring when it's warmed up and is wet outside. \n\nHope this helps! Feel free to DM me if you have any specific questions!",

Law school is all about the outlines but it\u2019s a lot better if you make them yourself.  It\u2019s crazy how much you can learn by talking about issues with your friends.  \n\nIt\u2019s good to have some clinic experience but it\u2019s not really too important, you\u2019ll get better experience if you can get a clerkship or a summer associate position.",

But inviting Ben Shapiro types is absolutely stupid.\n\nOne wonders why young Republicans always seem to try to invite extremists to campus.",

College campuses are meant to be public forms and limiting any discussion, even the bad ones, is counterproductive. \nInvite all the speakers, every week, have good ones, get bad ones, and as a student you will soon understand the differences. Exposure is the only way to teach someone something new these days. ",

Given Mr. Shapiro\u2019s popularity, in evaluating what has occurred on other campuses, the University felt it would not be able to provide a suitable venue, as well as the concomitant level of security, necessary to appropriately host him. The students who made the request were encouraged to find a local venue that was better equipped to manage the event, and to ensure the safety and security of the guests.\n\n&gt; Mr. Shapiro\u2019s appearances have drawn protests that include inappropriate behavior, as well as divisive and hateful speech, which is offensive to many people regardless of their age, politics or beliefs. As a private, faith-based, mission-driven institution committed to the human dignity of every individual, we stand in solidarity with vulnerable members of our community who may be targeted for discrimination, ridicule, or harassment by others.",

A fundamental part of any sucessful poltical, management, or education system is its ability to foster a variety of different view points. The act of denying he appearance is just going to foster a culture of denial and one sidedness among all groups of people. Overall the move seems enherintly undemocratic. ",

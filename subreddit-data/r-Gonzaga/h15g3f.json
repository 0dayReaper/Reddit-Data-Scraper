            "comment": "The author claims Gonzaga would get more nationally televised games by joining the PAC-12. \n\nGU had 14 games in the regular season on ESPN last season. Once on the SEC network which sucks. \n\nLast season the whole PAC-12 had 71 games on a combination of ESPN,  FS1, CBS and FOX.  That\u2019s an average of 6 games per team if distributed evenly.  I know they don\u2019t, but that\u2019s absolutely not a clear improvement. \n\nI\u2019m also not counting the PAC-12 network because GU fans might not have a cable package that covers that unless they also had one to watch some other team in the PAC-12 already. I don\u2019t even know what a league package would cost.",

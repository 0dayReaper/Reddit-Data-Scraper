    "postText": "I just found this sub and maybe thought I could get some good feedback, I don't really know anyone in the Cheney/Spokane area so I figured I could take my questions here. \n\nI just graduated from a community college in Longview Wa and I am going to Gonzaga in the hopes of getting into the law school with a focus on Politics. Currently I am coming in as a sophomore and I was wondering what would be best for me to accomplish/prioritize as an undergrad student looking to get into the Law school at GU.\n \nI was also wondering how active the political clubs are in Gonzaga? I know politics is a somewhat touchy subject pertaining to Universities but I am generally curious. ",

I was accepted with a (at the time of applying) 3.1 GPA and slightly above average LSAT. I kept myself involved with student issues where I did my undergrad and wrote about that and bartending in my letter of purpose. Do what interests you and find how it applies to law school when the time comes. ",

Like bringing speakers in for the club there's a process involved, hosting big events beyond meetings there's a process involved, fundraising there's likely a process. They seem to get a ton of leeway, especially compared to clubs like what used to be HERO (rebranded to something else forget what it is) that get constantly scrunitized.\n\nPut simply it feels less like they're a proper club and more like an area thing that happens to be exclusively GU students.",

    "postText": "I'm a freshman who transferred into the engineering school this semester and plan to declare a ME major. Looking at the planned out semesters, we don't seem to take any fewer credits at any point so im wondering if the workload stays the same, because if so then it feels like I'm not going to have any time for socializing or doing things outside of going to class and doing HW.",

            "comment": "Mechie here. The credit load does depend a bit on whether you brought any AP/running start credits into Gonzaga. Whatever engineering-related classes are on your four-year plan aren't going to change unless you take summer school. The core classes, however, will change if you have outside credit, or take summer school... You ask if the workload gets \"easier.\" If you mean that the work gets less difficult, then no. It gets harder, but gradually. If what you mean is \"does the work become more worthwhile?\" then yes, it does. I am guessing this is what you meant, because I felt the same way (lookin at you, first year seminar). The first two semesters would have been much easier without the seminar workload. Once you get past this class, the classwork becomes more focused on learning the material, not just completing assignments. \n\nIf you're looking for help managing the workload or just a group of people ~~suffering~~ going through the same thing, r/EngineeringStudents is a good place. Feel free to pm me as well if you have questions. This major is doable and can be fun sometimes.",

Statics is probably one of the \"harder\" classes, so you already have some idea of what you're getting into. Not to say that you could just take dynamics or controls without statics, but in terms of *workload* statics is par for the course. The conceptual material obviously gets more complex as you progress, but you also already have more understanding, too.\n\nAs for socializing, I had time to go out on weekends and stuff, no problem. But, I also had plenty of late nights/ all-nighters.",

I\u2019ll be honest that I felt really overwhelmed my first year in the program because I coasted through my high school classes but once I learned how to study better and started doing homework  with my classmates, my grades improved and I started to understand the material better. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019ll get easier from year to year, but I think you\u2019ll acclimate to the workload expected of you and be just fine. Each year you\u2019ll know more and more things about mechanical engineering and your classes will build on each other, it won\u2019t always be learning about a bunch of new concepts for the first time. \n\nI had a lot of time for fun and socializing but I was only able to do so because I planned out my week well. Getting homework done and studying with others during the week helped clear up my weekends for fun! After a while, my friends and I started to view studying or doing homework together as hanging out haha",

It\u2019s perfectly okay to not understand a class, and good professors will recognize you putting in work. Balance is key though! \n\nThe workload never really gets easier, you just learn to manage it better. I would recommend one summer of 2-3 core classes if you can afford it, it takes a significant amount of stress off of your shoulders",

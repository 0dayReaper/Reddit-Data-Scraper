Good job placement after graduation. Diverse CS students (everything from nerds to brogramers)\n\ncons: Only a couple research opportunities. A couple (really one) professors who are new from China can be hard to communicate with due to language barrier. Not a terribly large selection of jobs in Spokane for CS.\n\nI chose gonzaga for the above reasons, but also It's near lots of outdoors stuff and they gave me scholarships.\n\nFeel free to ask away if you have any questions.",

The work load tends to come in waves, sometimes you will have a fair amount of free time but others it's really cramming. Over all I would say courses are challenging but not excessively difficult, although I had trouble in very theoretical upper division classes when I didn't actively learn outside lectures. Gonzaga definitely has good internship opportunities, the career center will have job fairs and the TREK program will take you to different companies to see what they do and apply. For cs many of these internships would be summer since they can be far from Spokane, same with eastern I'm sure since Cheney is a college town and probably not home to many cs seeking companies.",

I wouldn't say most are 4.0 students, I'm certainly not, my GPA has never been terribly high because I don't test well. I would advise checking to see how classes will transfer before you take them though.\n\nDropping an email to the admissions office should get you an answer pretty quick regarding requirements.",

I got my AA in arts and sciences (for criminal justice) but changed to CS yon entering Gonzaga. I had no prior experience with the exception of a single course in visual basic in high school years ago as well as minor html knowledge. You don't need to take anything before transferring in but it couldn't hurt. The languages they focus on here are C++, python, SQL, and Java with a few others.",

I'm actually in a position now (programmer at Amazon) where I interview a lot of programmers, many of them right out of school, and I would say Gonzaga prepared me better than most universities seem to.",

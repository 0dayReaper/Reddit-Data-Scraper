    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n \nI am looking to expand my horizons (career wise), and thus have begun searching for online graduate programs (I work full time). I graduated from St. John's University in 2009 with a 4.0 GPA in Criminal Justice. I was researching advanced degrees when I came across a great sounding program offered by Gonzaga.\n \nIt's a M.A in Organizational Leadership \nhttp://www.gonzagaonline.com/online-masters-leadership.asp\n\n \nHas anyone here gone through this program, or know of some one who has? Basically, I dont want to waste two years of my life and $30,000 for a potentional employer to just dimiss it as one of those \"online degrees\" or as one person put it, a \"nebulous degree\". I want something that will help me when promotion time comes around or if I ever wanted to find a new job.\n \nIn any event, my main goal in all this is attaining a masters to help better secure my future. At this point in time I am a paralegal at a law firm and there is plenty of opportunity to move up. Would this degree help me achieve that?\n \nAny feedback would be much appreciated.\n \nThanks,\n \n",

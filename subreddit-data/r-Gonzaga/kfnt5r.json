    "postText": "Hello Zags,\n\nI am a HS thinking about applying to Gonzaga. I really want to make neuroscience  / congitive science my focus during college. I noticed, however, that Gonzaga does not have majors  for these subjects. Are there other ways that the academic departments incorporate these subject in? I just don't want to apply to a school that does not have what I want to pursue.",

            "comment": "GU is not super strong in the neuroscience department but does have a good biology program. Many people who pursue a BS in bio usually go on to something else, like dental school or PA school. It kind of depends on what your ultimate goal is, what are your career goals and post-grad college plans?",

My experience is more anecdotal than factual evidence so take it with a grain of salt. Someone who works for the university would be able to give you a better idea of the strength of varying programs in comparison to other universities, especially those that have a research focus (which Gonzaga does not). \n\nI had maybe 4-5 friends who studied biology and each were admitted to multiple graduate schools starting the fall after they graduated, so no gap years. It can be very challenging to put together a strong enough application to be admitted to graduate school your first round of applications (especially if your plan is to go to grad school immediately following undergrad), it speaks to the quality of the program and the quality of individuals Gonzaga produces! None of these individuals chose medical school mind you, they all pursued dentistry or PA school.",

I\u2019m not sure as to what extent of underclassmen curriculum dips into this, but talking to an admissions counselor might clear things up.",

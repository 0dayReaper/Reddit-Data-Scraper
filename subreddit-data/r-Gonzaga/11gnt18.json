I heard I should schedule an interview with an admissions counselor but I\u2019m not sure how to set that up. GU is my top choice, any suggestions to help get off of the wait list?",

Aka stay an extra semester? \n\nI\u2019m class of 2016 but I remember many friends doing that route for nursing. \n\nYou could always go in wanting to take the classes and just wait for an open spot. People change their minds during college and I\u2019m sure spots will open. \n\nSpeaking from someone who is years removed from college, an extra semester/year is not a death sentence or end of the world. Many people will feel bad about spending anything over 4 years at school. I honestly wish I had taken more time and been able to focus on studies more. \n\nYes budget wise it might suck but if it\u2019s what you want to do for a career then invest the extra time.",

You apply specifically to the nursing program, which hopefully is what you did when you first applied. At the end of freshman year the cohort gets a survey and picks the semester plan they want to follow. You can either complete it in 8 semesters, or in 9, which allows more time for to study abroad, have a minor, or even take time off. It is selected from GPA whether you get the plan you wanted. \n\nI don\u2019t have any advice for getting off the wait list. But I don\u2019t see a reason why you can\u2019t just call the office of admissions and ask.",

    "postText": "Hello all, \nI am currently a high school senior (female) in a Jesuit High School in southern california. I am planning to apply this fall to Gonzaga for fall 2020. I plan to study psychology. Before I do so, I would like to know what you guys believe are the pros and cons of the school? (they can be about anything relating to the school or surrounding areas if applicable). Also, if you have any information about internships available for undergraduates and connections after or during college please add that as well. \n\nThank you, have a great day!",

            "comment": "I would say my biggest con is lack of diversity. It\u2019s a pretty white school and can be hard for POC to feel as a part of the community. It will definitely be a culture shock coming from CA. With less diversity comes a more right leaning community, more so then what I\u2019m used to but nothing crazy or anything, I am also from CA. Just a little more noticeable. \nIf I was a freshman I\u2019d say Spokane itself was a con but now as an alumni I\u2019d say Spokane is a huge plus. I love the city so much, it\u2019s pretty lively, lots of outdoor stuff, good restaurants and bars. As a freshman from SF I hated it but I grew and learned that it is one of the best places in the country. \nThe community is the biggest plus which any zag will tell you. You just feel like you\u2019re a part of something great and beautiful when you\u2019re at Gonzaga. People here are so loving, some of the best staff ever! Most students are absolutely wonderful. Gonzaga is a very special place. \nThere\u2019s a lot to get involved in from clubs to intramurals to volunteering, there is something for most. \nCampus is beautiful, Spokane is beautiful, we\u2019re walking distance to downtown, close to bus lines to get places. Winters kind of suck and feel long, especially when it hits like March and there\u2019s still hella snow on the ground, this makes you appreciate warm weather so much more and the first warm day of spring will literally be the best day of your life and campus will be buzzing and will make you realize why you love this school. \nIf you have any questions please reach out! Also admissions gave alumni admission fee waivers so if you want your application fee waived hit me up! I have no one to give it too and would love to pass it on if you need it.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m also from Cali (Bay Area) and a big pro is how social and friendly students are. If you make friends with other classmates, you will see them in the hallways and say hi. \n\nA con is that there is a lack of diversity of both ethnicities and food. I\u2019m a student of color and it\u2019s pretty sad that in almost all of my classes, I\u2019m the darkest student. \n\nThere isn\u2019t that many options for different foods. If you rely on certain ethnic foods, bring them from home. \n\nMost if not all on campus jobs are for work study. If you are looking for a job / internship during the year, you will probably have to look outside of campus for one. \n\nHope this helps!",

They have students use a job finder called Handshake which is where all the companies put out job offers and students can apply to them. Some are specific to Gonzaga students only. \n\nFrom why others have told me, they aren\u2019t the greatest when it comes to finding jobs and internships on campus. \n\nThey do help to find jobs and internships over the summer and when you graduate but when you are a student trying to find them, it\u2019s not the easiest. \n\nHope this clarifies!",

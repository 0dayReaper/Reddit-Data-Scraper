    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am starting my first year of Mechanical Engineering in the fall and have been looking at the courses that I will be taking and the textbooks required for them. I haven't bought anything yet and have some questions:\n\nIs there a way I can buy them used from an upperclassman or third-party website? Should I wait until the first class to see if the textbook is even needed? I heard if I do this that supply is limited and the books will be more expensive. \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "You can find free online pdfs of some of the textbooks if you look hard or you could try facebook or something to buy used ones from upperclassmen. Another option is chegg or amazon for rental books if you arent planning on keeping them. \n\nIf you\u2019re considering renting try checking if you use the book in later classes. When I started in 2015 the same calc textbook was used for calc 1-3 so that might be worth buying. The physics department used to provide free codes to access online textbooks so check to see if they still do that before buying.\n\nI would avoid buying from the bookstore because those are usually the most expensive option. And be careful of buying foreign versions of textbooks because many of them have different problem sets than US versions.\n\nEdit: waiting for the first day of class is fine to get textbooks I never had any spike in price. You can also try emailing your professor beforehand (or checking reviews on ratemyprofessor) to see if they use the book",

            "comment": "My policy was to never buy textbooks before the first class. One to many times I bought the book ahead of time when I could have shared with a friend, found it online, or just straight up didn't need it.\n\nEdit: and if, after the first class, you think your actually going to need to use the book enough to justify buying it, buy used or rent. All of the information in those books is online anyways and you don't want to end up hauling around a massive stack of textbooks for the rest of your life",

            "comment": "Never rent your engineering textbooks. Odds are more than likely you'll need to reference something in a future class or even after you graduate. And if you find the pdfs online, (or even solution manuals online), always save a local copy to your hard drive. You never know when a link won't work anymore.\n\n\nIn some classes, you can buy the international edition for significantly cheaper than the US version. Same problem sets, different units.\n\n\n\nI've saved the best for last: Buy a previous edition. All but one of my professors at Gonzaga let me us previous editions of the required textbooks. The only issue with this is getting access to the homework problems, since publishers will add or remove problems between editions. Sometimes online access to homework is also required, so that might also prevent you from buying old textbooks. And don't just look at the previous edtion, look several editions back. For example, when you take Statics this spring, buy the 11th edition of Hibbler's statics book. Trust me, it's the exact same but costs less than $20. \n\n\nDepending on the course, don't forget to check the school library. You will probably only get it for a week or two at a time. Renew the book as often as you need. Only do this for courses you feel confident in, or if you already a pdf. \n\n\nSave for one book (Taylor's Classical Mechaics), I never bought a new current editon and saved literally hundreds of dollars. \n\n\nTL;DR: Never rent. Buy used. **Buy old editions.** Buy international editions.",

            "comment": "This is very much a \u201cto each their own\u201d type question. I would agree with the general opinion of the others in that you should consider keeping your engineering books. HOWEVER. Be smart about it. Do I still have any of my philosophy or gen Ed books? Absolutely not. I have the notes and coursework. I would say the same for the engineering general courses. You get a physics book with the online homework system they use. Calculus is a weird one because they use the book for all three semesters. I bought that for that purpose alone but sold it soon after because every idea in that textbook is on Paul\u2019s math notes online. But religion text books? Nope. Chemistry? I opened it once and sold it.\n\nI recommend considering keeping any book that deals directly with your major. I have almost every book dealing with MENG. Many of them are digital books from libgen or other free sites. I have a few important ones in hard copy- fluids, Thermo, heat transfer, mechanics of materials (bought mostly used because they were still current). The rest are digital copies that I didn\u2019t pay a whole lot (if anything) for because they are an older version and the prof was cool with students having an older version. \n\nFeel out during the semester how useful the book is/will be. I bought a statics book for dr. Nowak and realized that he gave so many more detailed notes that the book isn\u2019t necessary and sold it, keeping just a binder of notes and work. Find a system with books that works for you. Some books are absolutely not worth keeping. The book for ENSC244 computer methods was the worst written book I\u2019ve ever used, with one of my genius classmates finding multiple code errors in the text. \n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to dm me.\n\nEdit: there are a few online free sites that you can get full texts from, a quick google search will give you links. If you\u2019re going to rent thru the zagshop and the book will be used for multiple semesters, a buddy of mine rented a book for dirt cheap and then \u201clost it\u201d and paid the lost book fine which was less money total than buying outright or renting for 2 semesters.",

Do they very heavily on GPA? I'm taking running start and I've been doing it since last year. I don't have any hospital volunteer hours because of last year but I have a lot of hours working customer service at American Red Cross.",

I was in a similar situation where I definitely got Bs in some of my sciences (looking at you, chemistry) and I had 0 hours of experience other than getting CPR and First Aid Certified at American Red Cross. I was planning on doing some volunteer work but COVID kinda got in the way. Anyways I hope this was helpful and if you have any more questions, then I'll be happy to answer to the best of my abilities.",

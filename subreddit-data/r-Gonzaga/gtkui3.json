    "postText": "i'm a female junior in high school pretty seriously considering applying to Gonzaga. I'm Catholic but also spiritual and Buddhist-ish. definitely on the liberal side of the Church; I'm big on activism, social justice, etc. I love reading, writing, film, photography and art, classical music, hiking/running/biking...very bookish and kinda shy, but I can be outgoing and social as well, idk. not at all interested in sororities or other Greek life. would i like it at Gonzaga? how difficult are admissions? what is campus life like? I'm just looking for the general gist of it--what you'd tell a prospective student. thx!!",

            "comment": "Gonzaga is a great school. Spokane itself is a great city, it has its quirks and issues but so does everywhere else. However, the vast amount of biking and running trails that go through campus and through spokane are amazing. Lots of art and music opportunities downtown, especially in the form of small-size music venues. The Spokane arena also attracts some bigger names. Seattle's a 4 hour drive, coeur d'alene is just across the idaho border (40 minutes) and Mt. Spokane is a great ski place. As for the social aspects, gonzaga does a pretty decent job of providing opportunities for activism and social justice work. I'm \"catholic\" but not at all practicing and have never felt any obligation or pressure to do so. The social scene is quite varied, and there are things for everyone, whether they like parties and events or are the quieter types. It really is a great school. I love it there.",

Definitely has a community feel to it, the best out of all the colleges I visited when looking at different schools. I am definitely a quieter person too, but I met a ton of people in classes, clubs, and my dorm that I\u2019m still in touch with at home in quarantine.",

    "postText": "Got into Global Citizenship and was wondering if it\u2019s worth joining. I\u2019ll be in the honors college but not living in Crimont. Another LLC that I got accepted into was DeSmet Charter, but I\u2019m not much of a party person so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the best choice. Thanks!",

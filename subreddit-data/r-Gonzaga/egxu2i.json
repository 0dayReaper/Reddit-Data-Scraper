    "postText": "I'm a prospective student who already applied to Gonzaga this year. I'm interested submitting an honors college app, and I wanted to see if anyone here is in the honors college and can share any information about what it's like. Also, does anybody have any advice about what to submit in the app. I'm doing the activities right now and I don't have a ton of defined leadership positions, but I have a decent amount of ec's. Finally, what's the deal with the electronic portfolio? I don't really have any creative pursuits to show them, so I would probably have to write something up, and I'm pretty unclear about what they want to hear.",

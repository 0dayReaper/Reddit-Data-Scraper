            "comment": "You should definitely go in for an interview. It's optional, but in your case it'll help out a lot (specifically mention that you  were in foster care until you were 14 - it'll piece together a bit of why you had bad grades at the beginning of high school). Try your best on your ACT or SAT and if you get a high enough score on the test and your grades are getting better as you go through high school, you'll have a chance. You'll probably need As and Bs with very few Cs on the rest of your report card. Do whatever you can to get only As and Bs though. \n\nIf you could write about your specific experience when you apply, it would likely help you out tremendously. Edit that essay and send it to someone you trust to edit it (usually if you ask one of your teachers very nicely to help, they will. And if they do, be very thankful towards them because they really don't need to.).",

That should definitely include a face-to-face piece, but you should add in other elements like writing letters, setting meetings with prospective professors asking for advice, volunteering in the meantime, or researching opportunities to hit a feeder community college and transfer in (eg. Spokane community college). \n\nI can tell you that I know students with similar academic achievements that got into Gonzaga through non-academic means. But it's less-and-less often as Gonzaga slowly becomes more competitive. Edit: having attended a Jesuit or Catholic school seems to help a lot with the right recommendations. Have you talked to your school counselors about how to improve your chances? In many cases, they have a direct line to the Gonzaga admissions department and can help a lot.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been noticing that every year we make a deep tournament run, we haven\u2019t been able to finish the job. Even this year, we have the most talented team in school history, but we can\u2019t even beat Baylor, a team we should winning against. Every year, we play a cupcake schedule where we win every game by 20. This has ultimately put us at a disadvantage, because when we\u2019re in the tournament playing top teams game after game, we choke. We\u2019re not use to consistently being challenged in games, so when it\u2019s comes time for the big tournament games, we lose. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna win a title if our hardest conference games are against saint Mary\u2019s and BYU. This loss hurts, but seemed inevitable. Just some food for thought.",

It's there, but it's going to take cooperation with the other schools to make going to another school in the conference something other than being a punching bag for the Zags.",

Second, without a dedicated research program, it\u2019s also hard to join the PAC-12. Could it be done, sure, but it\u2019s still difficult. \n\nThe closest conference relative to Spokane would be the Mountain West, but in terms of conference difficulty they\u2019re about the same as the WCC, if not a little less. \n\nThe ideal conference in my opinion to join would be the Big East, but the issues with that revolves around travel.

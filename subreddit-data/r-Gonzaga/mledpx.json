    "postText": "We had an incredible season this year and it won't be our last incredible season. Of course it stings that once again we came up short in a national championship game but I think it's still an accomplishment to make the title game in just 4 years with different talented teams. Mark Few is an outstanding coach and I believe he still has a lot of great coaching left in him to get us that national championship trophy one day. Thank you Suggs, Timme, Kispert, Nembhard, Ayayi, and the rest of the Zags team for another great season! GO ZAGS",

Even though y\u2019all came one game short, don\u2019t hang your head low, keep them high!! To go undefeated in any sport is very difficult, and you guys will be scary for years to come! May God bless y\u2019all\n\nIt broke my heart seeing the Gonzaga players crying after the game because of how close they were to the trophy",

One bad game and you\u2019re out. \n\nA program requires solid teams year in and year out, to eventually have enough chances at putting together that one magical run. That, or have some upsets to allow more favorable matchups in the later stages (if Villanova had beaten Baylor, the championship game would have been against Houston, Arkansas, or Villanova, all teams you would have had an easier time beating)",

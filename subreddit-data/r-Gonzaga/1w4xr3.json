    "postText": "A band called Sphynx is playing at Carr's Tavern tomorrow. They are rising artists in the Austin, TX music scene. They were nominated as one of the top three performing bands in Austin. The best way to describe their sound is '80's synth pop with a little indie influence. Here is [their bandcamp page.](http://sphynx.bandcamp.com/) It would be awesome if they could get some supporters to come watch them perform. \n\nEdit: The show is 21+",

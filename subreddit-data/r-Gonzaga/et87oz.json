            "comment": "Usually those 4 person (I thought they were only 3 person but maybe not) apartments are for upper division housing, i.e. juniors and seniors that live on campus, so unless housing screws up you probably wont get one of those. They are the same size as all the others they just have 2 or three people fewer in them. Odds are you'll have to bring on two additional roommates or go with 2 randoms that housing throws in with you for a normal apartment in corkery. \nAlso corkery fills up super fast so if your housing time slot isnt great have a backup plan.",

The upperclassmen get their own rooms, so 3 people per apartment. Unfortunately the apartments are all the same size, so the lower classmen apartments are a bit crowded.",

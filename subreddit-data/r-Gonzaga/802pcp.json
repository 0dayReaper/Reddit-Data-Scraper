    "postText": "So I found this sub and decided to take a chance and see what people had to say about Gonzaga. I'm currently over at the UW in Seattle as a sophomore and it hasn't been going well. There have been glimmers of goodness but for the most part, I pretty much chose the wrong school. I'm reapplying for admission to Gonzaga for Spring 2019 because I'll be studying abroad in Prague during the fall. What are your likes and dislikes of GU? What do you wish you had known before you had gone, what do you wish you had done different, what tips do you have for making the most out of your time there... that kind of thing. I'll probably be tacking on at least another semester of school with the transfer, assuming I get in, so I just want to see what the reddit people think about the school, beyond what I've already experienced as a prospective student. \n\nThanks!",

                    "comment": "First off, thanks for answering!! I really appreciate it actually, that\u2019s all super helpful, even though you graduated way before my time (like way before my time). \n\nTo answer your question: it\u2019s not that UW is a bad school or that i don\u2019t love the campus, or that i haven\u2019t found classes I\u2019ve loved, or that i haven\u2019t had good experiences here. Basically I grew up in a small town, went to a small private christian high school, always had a sense of community and relationships with the people around me, even if I wasn\u2019t necessarily friends with them, and I knew who to go to if I was having a problem. But I got to the UW and here, because it\u2019s so big and seriously, there are like 40,000 undergraduate students here alone, it\u2019s pretty much sink or swim. They toss you in and say good luck and I sank pretty badly. I got sick pretty badly, I got a couple bad grades (only two and they didn\u2019t tank my gpa that badly, I\u2019ve since pulled it up), I made pretty much no friends, I now live alone in a single dorm because I had no one to live with, the resources like the counseling, advising and career centers are so backed up and inconsistently open that the chances of me actually getting to talk to who I actually need to talk to are slim to none. Classes are like the hunger games here when registration rolls around and don\u2019t even get me started on trying to get into your major if you came in with a bunch of extra credits or have a prior college gpa bc unless you were a genius in high school you\u2019re already screwed. At uw the communications department has a minimum application requirement of a 2.5 to be considered. But to be competitive they prefer a 3.4. With where I\u2019m at academically, and how long it takes to bring a gpa up like that, that wouldn\u2019t happen before I was due to graduate. So i got stuck with my current curriculum between history and poli sci, neither of which are really striking a chord with me at the moment, partly because of the departments. I also didn\u2019t rush and although I probably would have done fine in a sorority, I don\u2019t go out very much and I\u2019m not a huge party person which is exactly why I didn\u2019t rush. The intro classes in calculus, chem, bio, physics, and pretty much anything slightly difficult, are meant to weed out anyone who shouldn\u2019t be there and discouraged anyone who might actually have a passion for it from trying because they don\u2019t get the grade for it and the university doesn\u2019t have the resources to support every student who needs the academic help. There\u2019s just too many people. Aside from the fact that I\u2019m not wild about living in Seattle, I grew up about an hour east and i don\u2019t mind cities but Seattle is a bit much and I\u2019m smack in the middle of it. I\u2019m not even on the outskirts or in a suburb. And the uw is it\u2019s own city within that. I\u2019ve only had two professors bother to learn my name, both of them french because we had small lecture sections where we constantly spoke to one another. Most of my sections were 200+ people. There\u2019s just been a whole host of factors that went wrong and I knew pretty early on that I wasn\u2019t happy here but my parents wanted me to wait and wait and wait and then it was supposedly too late but then the dean of admissions Julie gave me a call (at the request of my old high school bishop) and asked me some questions and told me that I was still eligible for a quick reapplication and that it would at most set me back a semester in graduating which I don\u2019t mind and I can afford, especially since I\u2019ve spent the last two years at the UW, so here I am. Reapplying to Gonzaga for transfer admission next spring 2019. Just have to see how it goes. \n\nSorry that\u2019s so jumbled. I just kinda splurged on the page. ",

The university as a whole does a good job of preparing you for life after school. I met some of my best friends in college who I still try to meet up with at least once a year. My only big issues with GU are caused by some of the people who go there and not anything that the school does itself.",

                            "comment": "I lived off campus my last two years as do most upperclassmen. Landlords can be a little sketchy but overall it\u2019s way cheaper to live in a house with people. I payed around $400 a month including utilities. You are kind of at a disadvantage because you don\u2019t know anyone so you might have to live in an apartment by campus. The closer you live to campus the more expensive it is. Also, be sure to join lots of clubs and be social so you can make friends pretty quickly. A lot of us made our friends Freshman and Sophomore year when we were all living together so since you don\u2019t have that you\u2019ll need to get involved right away",

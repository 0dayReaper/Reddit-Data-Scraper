It wasn\u2019t fun to get sent home but the school was very good about getting everyone out in time before lockdowns. They also sent almost everyone in Spokane home and online pretty much immediately after that. Right now the school is desperately trying to prepare campus for all of us to potentially return. Spokane is still in partial lockdown so a lot of events/activities can\u2019t be held. How long we can attend in person classes is still up in the air.",

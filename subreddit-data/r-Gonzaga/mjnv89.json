            "comment": "As a lifelong UCLA fan and eventual alumni (who was born to UCLA alumni parents, went there for undergrad, and covered and traveled with the team for the Daily Bruin during the three Howland Final Four years) I wanted to congratulate you guys on your epic victory and for participating in one of the greatest games in the history of televised sports with us. \n\nI was content with the Final Four appearance and assumed that we would get blown out in this game, and even while the game was happening I was just like \"OK, I'm content that we kept it close at halftime/with 10 minutes left/with 8 minutes left/with 6 minutes left\" etc and kept waiting for the inevitable Zags 10-0 run to happen and for the other shoe to drop. It wasn't until there were like 2 minutes left in regulation that I actually thought our guys could potentially have a chance to win it. And then when OT hit I thought for sure you guys would beat us in OT, and then when the score was tied heading into the final seconds of OT I thought you guys would for sure beat us down in 2OT. \n\nHave to give credit where credit is due. Timme having the presence of mind to get into the perfect spot where the refs absolutely HAD to call a charge even though they traditionally swallow their whistles in the final seconds was a genius and badass move. And the OT game winner goes without saying. \n\nI'm proud of our guys but I'm proud of you guys as well. And while it's been an honor, I must ask you one last favor. Please kick Baylor's ass by double digits and bring home the victory for the West Coast.",

    "postText": "My small company helps students find off campus apartments and we are considering expanding to Gonzaga. I'd like to hear from Gonzaga students about how hard or easy the apartment hunting process is. Are off campus apartments mostly fully booked or widely available? How do most students find an apartment? When do most students sign a lease? Any other info you'd like to give would be so appreciated.\n\nThank you all for your help!",

            "comment": "Gonzaga requires two years on campus. After that, most students move into off campus houses in the neighborhood. Some students move into apartments but there aren\u2019t many apartment buildings in the area, the two main ones are both much more expensive than a house so those usually have openings. Then there are various smaller apartments scattered through the neighborhoods. Most people sign leases in September the year before. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that hard for students to find housing as people post their open rooms on Facebook and such. And most people have their housing figured out early on so not many people scrambling at the end.",

    "postText": "Hey y'all I have a couple different questions regarding the LLC program at Gonzaga so if any of y'all are able to answer these questions (even if its just one) that would be extremely helpful!\n\n1) is joining one of the LLC groups worth it?\n\n2) I like the outdoor pursuit one but idk if living off campus the first year is good. what do y'all think about living off campus first year? is the outdoor pursuit one fun?\n\n3) I saw that the Cura Personalis and the Learn 2 Lead are the most popular. I'm worried that if I apply to both of those and don't get in, I will be scrambling to find a dorm room and roommate because everyone else will have found their living situations already. What do y'all think??\n\nIf you have any opinions/insight on the LLC Programs please let me know. Thanks y'all!!!!",

They made it sound like it was a cool way to meet others who have similar interests in the outdoors, but they were slightly annoyed about the trek to and from campus (maybe an axtra 5-10 min walk to classes). Besides that you get free outdoor equipment rentals and whatnot which is a big bonus if you feel you will put it to use. \n\nI was in CM myself so not super familiar with the LLC programs but hopefully this was somewhat helpful! Excited to see all the new homies on campus in the fall\ud83d\ude1b",

I\u2019m guessing outdoor pursuit is Marian, and it\u2019s really not off campus by a lot. Like, an extra 5 minute walk from Twohy/Hemmingson. Campo gives rides home if you\u2019re on the opposite side of campus late at night, and the area around there is pretty safe, it\u2019s been gentrified a lot in recent years so there\u2019s not any more sketchy people than there would be in a house off campus.",

If you have outdoorsy interests and plan to get involved in outdoor related activities as well then it could be a great fit! I'll also plug for the encountering cultures llc! I was there and my brother just finished up his year there. It's a good spot on the top floor of Coughlin where the dorm is pretty nice. Good community there!",

Anyone who I know lived in Cura or L2L loved it and were able to find a solid friend group. \n\nNot to mention, Coughlin is by far the nicest dorm + amenities, has a chill social vibe, is next to the gym, and next to CM.\n\nWhen I was a freshman I also hung out at the Outdoor Pursuits dorm. They had a strong community there, especially being off campus a couple blocks into the Logan.",

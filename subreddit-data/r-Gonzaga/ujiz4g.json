It's more common for graduate students to live off-campus, however I'm not certain about international graduate students in different programs. The international students in my program don't live on in the dorms.",

If not, they may be able to provide you with contact info for places nearby that offer student housing. \n\nIf you want to live with other students, you also have the option to join the Gonzaga students Facebook group and post in the Free &amp; For Sale group- lots of students use that group to find housing and you have to prove you're a student to join the group. \n\nPublic transportation is pretty simple, your student ID gives you free access; Spokane public transport isn't the best though, very mediocre. Most things you'll want to go to are within walking distance though and it's pretty easy to find people who have cars whobare willing to go places with you!",

The thing is that when it\u2019s winter and it snows it snows a lot so you\u2019re gonna need a jacket for when it rains and another jacket for the snow. Rain won\u2019t be common but it snows a lot. While you won\u2019t need snow pants necessarily, some jeans or heavy duty pants are needed",

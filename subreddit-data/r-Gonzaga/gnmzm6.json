    "postText": "How would you compare Seattle University to Gonzaga? Are people more vocal about their faith in Gonzaga than in Seattle University? I know Seattle University is a Jesuit school and I know plenty of non-Catholics who went there. How does Gonzaga compare?  are there a lot of students who are not Roman Catholic at Gonzaga? I have heard that although Seattle University is a Jesuit school, people there tend to leave you alone but at Gonzaga, people there kind of expect you to be a practicing and/or believing Catholic. Is that true?",

I'm not sure if that is the best way to put it, but what I mean is that no one really talks about their religious beliefs a lot. If you are apart of another religion or are non-religious, then you will have no problem.  I'm not big on religion and I've never had any problems or felt weird or out of place or anything. It's very chill. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course there will always be some groups of people that are ultra-dedicated to their beliefs but that happens at any school.",

There\u2019s variety in the students, some people are very devout, some aren\u2019t. If you aren\u2019t a devout Catholic, you\u2019ll still be able to fit in at Gonzaga.",

I think only like 35% of the student body is Catholic? The only thing is that there are a few required religion courses (only one of them is Catholicism) and spirituality (usually nondenominational spirituality) gets incorporated into extracurricular activities sometimes. However, in my experience, it\u2019s always been optional and I haven\u2019t felt pressured.  Hope that helps!",

    "postText": "The world is falling apart, Drew Timme Potentially making his final NCAA basketball start. He knows what\u2019s at stake, he knows what this would mean to him. As he calls it \u201cthe holy grail\u201d he IS the man to do it all. Drew timme ( And maybe Julian strawther if he decides to show up ) will ball out. No Jalen Suggs no problem. The Gonzaga bulldogs are THE clear pick for the win. Gonzaga shines in everything the bruins are missing. This IS Gonzaga\u2019s year. No more 1 seeds to stop them. As we prepare for this matchup all of anxiously waiting, one question remains. Will this be the last we see of Drew Timme? Aka Drew Himme Aka Timme time Aka big country, find out this Thursday.",

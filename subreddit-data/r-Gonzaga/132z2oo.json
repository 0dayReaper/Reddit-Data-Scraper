    "postText": "Got into both as a transfer student and trying to decide between the two. From what I can gather, both have similar business schools and accounting programs. I just don\u2019t know which one to pick. The main downside to Gonzaga is that Spokane is a smaller city and not a place where I would make a career out of accounting. Let me know your thoughts. Thanks.",

Professors are all fantastic and care about students. I don\u2019t know anything about San Diego, but I highly doubt you would regret choosing Gonzaga accounting.",

Just make sure to build relationships in your classes, with professors and attend all alumni networking events and you\u2019ll be in a good position for post graduation.",

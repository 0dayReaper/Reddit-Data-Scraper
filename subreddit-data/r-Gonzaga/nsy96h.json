There is an AMC walking distance from campus so if she wants to go to the movies, some tickets or gift cards can be useful. \nBut there are popular chains almost anywhere walking or driving distance so pick what she likes ands you should be set.",

There is also a Starbucks on campus! \nSome other restaurants within walking distance of campus: Qdoba, Chipotle, Pita Pit, and Subway. \n\nDe Leon\u2019s is a bit of a nicer Mexican restaurant on Hamilton, really good spot! Method is a good choice, it\u2019s a juice bar/ cafe downtown Spokane that is popular! \n\nFor grocery, Safeway is really the only option within walking distance but if she has access to a car Trader Joe\u2019s and Fred Meyer are also relatively close!",

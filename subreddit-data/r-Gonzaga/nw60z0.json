You basically can't take any electives outside of your technical electives, which are all engineering-based.\n\nThat being said, there is still plenty of time to hangout on the weekends. You can still do some clubs, but you definitely will need to find the right balance, and that's a very personal decision. \n\nIt also depends on your ability to manage your time. I pulled many long nights, but in all honesty I could've probably avoided that if I had managed my time better.",

            "comment": "Look, to put it bluntly, it\u2019s a full-time job. 40 hrs a week and overtime. That being said, if you treat it like a full time job, it is manageable (and really not that bad at all). Like another commenter said, time management is crucial. At least 3 of those 18 credits almost every semester will be a non-stem \u201ccore requirement\u201d class, which tend to be less material intensive (think philosophy or a religious studies class) which will take up much less time outside of class. Biggest way to get everything done is find time in your schedule to get a few small tasks done. An hour between classes? Do one homework assignment. No class after 1 pm Thursdays? Do laundry that day and grind on homework while it\u2019s going. Do this and suddenly evenings and weekends seem to be free and open.\n\nIt seems daunting, but the engineering programs are super close knit and you will find study groups and classmates that make things so much easier. Biggest recommendation I have is look into living in the engineering living learning community (llc). You\u2019re guaranteed to live with people in the same classes and it\u2019s quite fun. The work is tough but it is manageable.",

Graduated over 15 years ago, and love what I\u2019m doing now because of the work I put in at GU. Study groups are extremely helpful and going to the professor\u2019s open office hours are also pretty useful. Not all professors are the best, but most I found want to help their students.",

            "comment": "I graduated recently, and lived in Marian as both a resident and an RA. I met a ton of good friends in Marian. I didn't use the access to outdoor programming as much as some of the other students, but I got a free (or very cheap, I don't totally remember) bike rental for the year that was great for getting around campus, as well as rented sleeping bags and tents for weekend trips. As a Marian resident, short rentals of small equipment was free. \n\nI think that the distance Marian is away from the rest of campus isn't a drawback, but ended up being a good thing. You do have to cross Hamilton, which is a busy street, but you have a push button that stops traffic without having to wait for a stop light, Marian is closer to the Hemmingson Center, (where most campus food is) than several other residence halls, and the distance fosters a close connection between Marianites. \n\nFinally, the building itself is on the older side, but has some of the biggest rooms on campus, sinks in every room, huge closets, and some of the best common spaces and kitchens on campus. \n\nAs you can tell, I love Marian, and if you're even a little interested in outdoor activities from skiing to biking to camping to rock climbing, I would try and live in Marian. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n#GoZags",

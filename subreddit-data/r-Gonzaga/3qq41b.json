Where are the best places to go and what specific dishes are the best? And what food/places should be avoided?",

But you'll probably eat at the cog a lot because it's a social thing and swipes are a lot less precious than flex money. Which is fine! When I add there, the cog always had lots of options. Especially for weekend brunch. ",

            "comment": "I actually like the new cog. I'm a junior so I had to suffer through two years of the barc and it was definitely underwhelming. the new cog has plenty of options every day so you can usually get something good. Additionally, places like Einstein's, subco, panda, and duffs have good food, or you can always buy a sandwich or something from the marketplace. If you go to the cog, then Yes, the food can be worse some days but it can be really good others. There are plenty of options so saying blanket statements like \"fuck campus food\" really aren't representative of everything that is offered. Eating off campus can be time consuming and expensive, but there's more variety. I chose to get a meal plan this year and probably will get one senior year too because of the convenience and because there really are plenty of options to choose from. Hope this helps!",

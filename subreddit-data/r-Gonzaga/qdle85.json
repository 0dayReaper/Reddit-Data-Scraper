    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am looking into applying to the 2022 part-time MBA program at Gonzaga, and am interested in hearing program reviews and outcomes from students who have started or completed a Gonzaga MBA. I have not been able to find an employment report for the program, so any information that you are able to provide would be greatly appreciated, particularly the strengths and weaknesses of the program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor perspective, I am considering general management or analytics as possible concentrations, am an international student, and have a low 320s GRE score. From what I have been able to gather, Gonzaga has a very respectable undergraduate business program, but their MBA offering *may* not carry the same recognition and credibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for your assistance!",

            "comment": "My experience with the MBA program has been mixed. It is a very flexible program with offerings on the weekends, evenings, and hybrid synchronous/asynchronous which has been extremely helpful as a part-time student. There are also tracks that will allow students to finish their MBA in 1 year.\n\nThis flexibility means your colleagues will have a wide variety of experience and level of commitment to class work. Some students will be fresh out of undergrad and taking an overload of classes, while others will be managing other priorities and working through an MBA at a slower pace. \n\nThe MBA program has strength in accounting, finance, and now project management. There isn\u2019t a strong emphasis on analytics, but you will live up some principles via stats and other coursework. The alumni network is very strong in the local are and throughout the west coast, and there are regular job fairs and tours to help with recruiting efforts in the major cities.",

However, I know they exist, and the program is well priced in my opinion.\n\nAmount of coursework will vary from class to class but I plan for 2-4 hours per week per course. Some will be reading heavy, some will be writing heavy, and if you haven\u2019t been in school for a while i find it takes me longer than i remember.\n\nAs far as career direction, it\u2019s only positive. Many in my role and beyond have MBAs and other post graduate degrees. I am considering the ORGL program at Gonzaga at some point in the future. You mentioned \u201cgeneral management\u201d, I would take a look at that program as well.",

For me, once completed, I was immediately promoted by my employer. They also helped with the tuition, it was very much worth the time. GU is respected in the NW.",

I've been to the Knitting Factory.\n\nAre there any \"clubs\" in the area? Any other entertainment venues like Knitting Factory? Any other bar area? I would think an area with multiple colleges in the vicinity would have a more happening night life, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWhat gives?",

At one point, a couple older dudes came over and asked me and my buddy \"where are all the hot college chicks? I thought this place was supposed to be cool on Thursdays...\"\n\nI told them to wait about 20 minutes and they'll see, but they couldn't be bothered and left the bar to go be creepy somewhere else. Sure enough, 30 minutes later... the bar is PACKED--karaoke blaring, dance floor full of women, 9001 people all trying to order long islands and fireball shots. Good times...",

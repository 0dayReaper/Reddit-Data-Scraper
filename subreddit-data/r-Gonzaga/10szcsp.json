    "postText": "Just started a small business and I sell handmade bow ties and jewelry. So far it\u2019s just me photographing myself in my jewelry. I like that I own my business but don\u2019t really want to be the face of it. Would anyone be interested in modeling my bow ties and jewelry at the mall somewhere? Or know where I can find people? Would love to take the pics somewhere public like the mall or university or wherever. I\u2019d share with you the edits and tag you on social media. Also, I\u2019m not a professional photographer. All I got is an iPhone, but it takes damn near pretty good pics.",

Just thinking out loud. \n\nThere are also local to Spokane Facebook groups for business related activities. This also allows you to share your existing photos to provide yourself some legitimacy as to what you are doing. \n\nAlso, remember your own personal safety and security, as well as creating a safe and secure environment for anyone who may be helping. \n\nBest of luck OP!",

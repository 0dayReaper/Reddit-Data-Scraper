    "postText": "Hey all! I\u2019m an incoming grad student who will be living just off campus. Was wondering if people thought it was worth it to pay the $150 per semester for the on campus gym membership or if I\u2019d be better off finding somewhere else? I don\u2019t have a complicated gym routine by any means and like playing pick up basketball. Also any other campus/Spokane tips I\u2019d love to hear them as I\u2019m from Montana and have only been to Spokane once",

Plus it's super convenient to have the ability to de-stress during the day by going to the gym right on campus.",

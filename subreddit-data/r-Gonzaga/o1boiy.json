I\u2019m kind of worried now that there\u2019s gonna be a ton of noise or activity coming from there and that it\u2019s gonna be really annoying. Has anyone had this experience and is it manageable or is it super annoying to be by the bathrooms?",

It wasn\u2019t bad at all to be honest, only thing was in the morning I could hear the buzz of the paper towel dispensers, but since your across and not sharing a wall I don\u2019t think that will be a problem for ya.  Wouldn\u2019t expect it to be too noisy although it mainly depends on the type of people in your wing...hopefully they aren\u2019t too rowdy\ud83d\ude1b",

You won\u2019t have to worry about losing sleep on the week days because you live next to the bathroom. Just living in CM will probably be your biggest concern if you are a light sleeper. My roommate frequently lost sleep, but I never did",

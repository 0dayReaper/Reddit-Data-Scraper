    "postText": "I am hoping to get in to Gonzaga ASAP\n\nSituation: My abusive household sent me to Russia without letting me finish my junior year. (I'm getting a Gonzaga this summer and emancipation) \n\nI have a few questions for people who did get into PSU and understand college application process, because I honestly don't know who to ask. \n\nWhen are applications due for Fall 2022? (I checked and it said Feb 1 but that's ridiculously early) \n\nIf I'm too late for Fall 2022, when are applications for Winter 2023 due? \n\nI don't have any money and my goal is to get enrolled and go straight to dorms when I come back in America. What are some tips on getting into dorms if u don't have money? \n\nCan I loan rent and pay it back? I don't have any credit history\n\nWhat are jobs available on campus? Which is paid the best?  \n\nScholarship recommendations? \n\nAny other tips?  \nAny help is appreciated:)) \n\nI was a straight A student before this btw.",

            "comment": "Going to GU can be pretty damn expensive, especially since they raised tuition, board, and housing, but there are several things to budget\n\n1 you have to stay in on campus housing for the first two years, so don't worry about not getting in, and with that is a meal plan. Try and find cheaper dorms and use that money you save to get the unlimited meal plan and only spend your meals there. You'll get 500 campus dollars but you can save those until necessary or you can get them back after you graduate\n\n2 scholarships depends on major and merit so being a straight A student helps, but apply to whatever is even near a possibility of getting because it all helps. You could probably also look into scholarships granted to  foreign students or language speakers for you to make something out of your time in Russia. \n\n3 as for applying, I would call the admissions office at their phone number to try and get an answer about applying as that would be your best source. I transferred in so i was a bit different in that respect.\n\n4 there a plenty of jobs on campus for varying lengths of hours required and they at least pay WA state min wage of 13.69 or even higher depending what you land\n\n5 As for a housing loan, I'm not too sure. You'd have to ask someone in housing about that but if not there are student loans elsewhere, although they are not as appetizing.\n\n6 last that i have for right now is take as much free food and supplies as you need/want. There is no such thing as too much if you need it and it isn't just free, you paid for it. My friends and I would say, \"It's included in the price of tuition,\" whenever we take a lot of free stuff. I'd live by that motto especially if you are tight on cash. There is also a food pantry that gives food you can bring back to your dorm if you need supplies there with no charge. \n\nIf you have any other things lmk and I'd be glad to give you an answer, but otherwise best of luck to you and I hope to see you on campus.",

                    "comment": "I agree with all of this, but I have a note to add on the scholarship part. \n\nBecause they are a private school(could be the same for State) GU has the ability to award scholarships based on things more personal than merit. Your personal and situational diversity matters to them, regardless of race and gender.\n\nEssays are a good platform to acknowledge some of the trials you have experienced.\n\n Furthermore, I would read the mission statement of the school to understand and convey how Jesuit education and the commitments to doing good work in the world tie into the person you want to become and how Gonzaga can help you achieve that.",

I went to camps put on by Coach Fitz, Dan Monsen and Mark Few back in 94-98, and attended one at your illustrious university in 97 where i made the all-star team and met John Stockton. Your school has a special place in my heart, and wanted your community to know there is a strong proud contingent of Canadian fans, not just because of the strong Canuck presence on the team. Its amazing and inspiring to watch the team grow every year!\n\nGo Zags!",

            "comment": "It\u2019s very much a mixed bag. For background I\u2019ve gone to catholic school my whole life but now am atheist and was all through college. You have to take at least 3 religion classes I believe. You have options but they\u2019re a limited. Only one of mine was on Catholicism. I also took Hebrew studies and Islam. All of them were just very focused on studying the religion and not trying to push anything on you. \n\nI had many atheist friends and many religious friends. I met the most religious people I\u2019ve ever met at Gonzaga. It was a little weird seeing kids my age so so religious but I got used to it and realize everyone grows up very differently. I had never once felt though anyone was pushing any sort of religion on me, whether it be staff, students or faculty, except for when I went on a retreat but that was to be expected. I just kind of spaced out during the super religiousy parts because Gonzaga retreats are amazing and so worth it even if you\u2019re not religious. I\u2019m general though religion was never really in my mind at Gonzaga. \n\nAs for political leanings, the majority of people are probably left. But there are definitely a lot of people at the center and to the right, trump right even. These people tend to be pretty outspoken so it feels there\u2019s a lot but really most of campus is pretty liberal. We do have a lot of upper class white people and a lot of rural people so we do get a good amount of Republicans. Seen a few MAGA shit here and there. A lot of it depends on who you surround yourself with too. All of my close friends (about 15) are liberal except for one who\u2019s center. And most of my other friends are liberal too. It all depends on the people you surround yourself with. If you\u2019re looking for a very politically active campus, Gonzaga isn\u2019t really one. There are a few protests here and there and political events but nothing like a UC Berkeley or UW",

Back in my day usually the 300 level religion classes were focused on world religions and weren\u2019t only Christianity based. I came from public school and had no experience with religion, which made religion classes a little harder since I didn\u2019t know who anyone was besides Jesus. \n\nMost of the students come from the greater west coast (Seattle, SF, San Diego, Denver), large metro areas that generally lean left. I think the student demographics accurately represent that. I didn\u2019t know we had college political groups until my junior year, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s very politically active on campus.",

Got an A- in the class based on my essays in class about what I\u2019ve learned. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly not overbearing compared to other schools like Pepperdine and BYU",

Yes, every classroom has a cross on the wall and you'll probably take classes with a Jesuit at least once while you're there, but it is up to you to interact with the religious parts of campus. We do get some days off for Feast days or special Masses (Mass of the Holy Spirit is the best break during week 2) but no one is required to attend Mass and most people just sleep in. You are required to take 2 RELI courses as part of the university core - Christian/Catholic Traditions and World/Comparative Religions - but you get to pick which ones to sign up for. My friend group all took different classes, and those who weren't Catholic said that they enjoyed learning more about the Catholic faith from an outsider perspective. (Note: I am a Religious Studies major and have been involved with Mission and Ministry before but there has never been any pressure from anyone on campus to subscribe to a particular faith tradition)\n\nIn terms of liberal/conservative, the campus body is mostly liberal with some conservative pockets. There is a group that prays the rosary in front of Planned Parenthood down the street, but the number of students who fall into that category is a very small subsect of the greater student population. The Office of Mission and Ministry has held phone banks for students to call their representatives and advocate for DACA legislation in the past, and we've had speakers like Ronan Farrow and Angela Davis come to campus in recent years. The administration is pretty liberal (although they do bend whatever directives come from higher-ups like the Jesuit of the West and the Bishop of Spokane) from time to time. Spokane is a red bump in a blue state so be prepared for that but I have always found friends and organizations on campus that matched my political views. (Note: I came from very blue Chicago and was kind of shocked when I first visited Spokane but if you seek out resources you'll find a lot)",

From my personal experience religion does occasionally work its way into the classroom however not in a pushy way. You will also have to take 1 Christian Catholic religion class but there are lots of cool options available. I'm not personally religious and none of my friends really are either. Most people keep to themselves. You deffinatly won't feel judged for your beliefs because beliefs rarely come up unless you bring them up yourself. As for people values it's something like 70% liberal I think.( Not one hundred percent sure on the accuracy of that but deffinatly majority liberal).",

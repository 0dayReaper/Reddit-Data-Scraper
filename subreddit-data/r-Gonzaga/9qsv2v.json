There is not a lot of information on how the admissions into the Mechanical Engineering program works. Is there anyone who is in it? how competitive is it? and how good is the program?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, what is it like to transfer here? are there a lot of students who transfer here? I am thinking about going here but going from public school to a private school is a big change for me. ",

            "comment": "Im not really sure about the transfer process but as someone who went through the engineering school (for structural).  They have a pretty rigid course schedule that they use to get you out in 4 years.  If you are transferring and have taken or have not taken certain classes in their intended order then there is a good chance you'll get stuck in courses with students of different graduating years if that makes sense.  \n\nYou also have to complete 2 semesters of philosophy and 2 semesters of religion before you graduate so if you're an upper upper classmen then that may mess you up.",

The professor believed that Gandolf was an exceptional version of what a leader should be.  It was a great class.",

With few exceptions, once accepted into Gonzaga all you have to do get into the program is declare. It's not like state schools where you get into the university then have to apply to your program. I believe the only programs like that at GU are business (even then not really) and nursing. I have a good number of friends who majored in engineering and now work at Boeing so it's a solid program. \n\nAs far as what it's like to transfer in, it's seemingly easy. I would recommend joining clubs or living in student housing (they make you for two years anyways). You won't have that typical freshman bonding experience so the two things I mentioned above with help you meet people and find your group! I wouldn't say the transfer population is large, but it's not rare. \n\nWhere are you transferring from?",

    "postText": "Last summer I had the chance to visit Zambezi, Zambia, where I saw the devastating impact that poverty has on development. In this country, those infected with HIV/AIDS have access to the medication that can save their lives, but the poorest often cannot afford the necessary nutrition to supplement their treatment. \n\nThat is where we want to help. In supporting an HIV/AIDS support group based out of Zambezi, Zambia, we want to develop a network of chicken coops that provide sustainable food and income to this organization. \n\nDeveloped by a group of Gonzaga seniors, we are already over half of the way to our goal of raising $25,000. Please check out our website and consider making a contribution. Every dollar donated goes directly to our organization, and is fully tax deductible. \n\nPlease support local philanthropy and activism. \nCheck out our website: www.hopeforzambezi.org\nAnd on facebook: www.facebook.com/hopeforzambezi  ",

But during the weeks it's only really a few hours of work. And it was a great time to get to know people as I really got a long with my coworkers and had a lot of time to talk with them during work. But I would take this with a grain of salt as they have changed the boss since I worked there\nI also hear that the mailroom can be really good to work at. Generally it's pretty chill just with the rushes after class ends. And if nothing is happening you can do your homework while working.",

Usually super easy, business hours, weekdays only. Otherwise you'll be working in the cafeteria or doing janitorial/facilities work which isn't bad but isn't as easy.",

Jeff (who oversees work studies) is a fantastic guy and is very flexible with hours. He always gave me time off when I needed it, and he's a believer of putting the \"study\" in work study (meaning if there's nothing to do, you'll get paid to sit around and work on homework).",

We basically set up the events around campus and keep the Hemmingson center looking nice. The work is chill and the team is really great. Definitely recommend!",

It's basically tech support plus some other fun things (VR, 3D printing, projects, etc). If you're at least competent with technology, but more importantly good with/enjoy customer service, it's a really fun job! 99% of people you help are students too, so everyone's really nice and it's not like typical customer service jobs you read about.",

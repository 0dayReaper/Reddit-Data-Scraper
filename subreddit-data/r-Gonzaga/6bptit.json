Getting into those house parties are hit or miss depending on the house and the hosts.\n\nIf partying is a priority Gonzaga might not be for you though.",

They are considerably more strict than most schools are when it comes to caching kids. In 2014, Gonzaga had the 3rd highest alcohol write up rate in the country. That's not because we party that hard. The RA's are pretty good at catching kids drinking in their dorms. The punishment however vary by offense. Based on the number of write ups and what they where for, you will receive a certain punishment from community standards (Jae Webb most likely). At first they aren't that bad but by 3 alcohol write ups (which isn't hard to get) you'll be on conduct probation. It's a pretty strict system. Thought I would explain it to you. Your an incoming freshman right? \n\nDM me if you wanna chat about GU. I'd love to fill you in on how the school works if your new!  ",

Party favors are more difficult because you would need to find somebody local, older, or connected to people off campus. Totally possible to find a good connect since there are enough locals at GU.

GU is a jesuit school and for the most part students are focused, myself included. \n\nGo to CU boulder, ASU, U of WA, hell even Puget Sound if you're seeking a good education, party school with rich kids and small setting. \n\nAlso, skip WSU. Great party scene, but party favors are rarer. Cops shakedown students and courts are in essence military tribunals.\n\nBest of luck.",

You should \"like\" it if you support their message, involved or not.\n\nIf you happen to see this post today... there is going to be a demonstration today. They are going to march upon the Bank of America building downtown. \n\nFrom the Facebook Group:\n\"ATTENTION: We are having our first Rally today at the Bank of America Building- we need as many people as possible. Many have asked when our fist march is, and this is it, so we need your support.\nWe are meeting at the occupation site of Riverside and Monroe at 4:30 and from there walking over to Howard and Spokane Falls Blvd to meet with the union group in town and from there we are walking together in Solidarity to protest at the Bank of America building.\"",

We did some marching around downtown and it was neat to see a lot of people join in, while others were honking their horns and cheering from their cars. There is a lot of support out there, but not enough people on the ground. ",

An option would be to leave it at home at first to enjoy your first few month at Gonzaga and then bring it over thanksgiving so you\u2019re all settled in and have friends and stuff. Also a good idea to bring it then as it will get colder and  you\u2019ll just want to stay inside.",

Spokane does have a theft problem and rarely, but it happens, will someone break into the dorms, typically only the off campus ones like corkery which is upper class and chardin and crimont which are underclass. If you\u2019re in those dorms just make sure the door is locked and windows closed when you leave. If not you\u2019re chill. I always left my window open and door unlocked when in the dorms. Sometimes I would even forget my laptop in the common room over night and it\u2019d still be there although wouldn\u2019t recommend it. People also often left their ps4s and Xbox\u2019s in common rooms and never heard of one getting stolen. But again would put it back in your room just to be safe.",

If you're in a traditional style room then it's fine, just keep door locked when gone. If you're in a suite or an apartment, a PS4 or similar is great to have in the suite common area as long as you trust your suitemates. Best bet in that case is keep it in your room until you get to know them. Campus is pretty darn secure. I wouldnt worry too much.",

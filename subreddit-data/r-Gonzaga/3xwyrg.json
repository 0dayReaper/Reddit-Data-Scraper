    "postText": "so I got deferred from early action. My sophomore and junior year grades were low due to family tragedy that occurred and they want to see my first year transcripts for senior year. I got a 3.7 this semester and was wondering if I still have a chance of getting accepted. Does anyone know if i will be accepted? I am in the regular pool of apps now",

Gonzaga is a wonderful place.",

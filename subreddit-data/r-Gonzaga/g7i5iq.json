As a freshman it was pretty solid for me, but I only speak for myself, and I do know some people that liked their unlimited plan. Hope this helps!",

The 800 bullbog bucks one works really well for me. Keep in mind that you can spend bdbs at cash and carry and some other places. I would recommend unlimited swipes if you live in coughlin, maddona or CM. Anywere else and its probably closer to go places other than the cog",

I had unlimited my freshman year when I lived in Coughlin and the 175 plan my sophomore year when I lived in Kennedy. Also pro tip is to do lunches or dinners at Cataldo because the food is higher quality/fresher sometimes and you can take it to go",

Time to join the PAC 12 or Mountain West or else yall will never be taken seriously. Might get downvoted but it's the truth. And maybe yall could actually have some competition. BYU might even leave the WCC to go to the American conference anyway. Time to jump ship!!!!!",

Adding Gonzaga would dilute the number down.\n\nNever gonna happen.",

There's 11teams in basketball in the MWC they make 12. They want their Basketball program. Nothing to do with football. Gonzaga basketball is keeping the lights on in a majority of these WCC gyms. Their take home from the last 3 tourneys, is insane amount of money. Nobody in the WCC in the last decade besides GONZAGA has been to the Sweet 16. BYU's not been out of the first round in forever their last good run was with Jimmer.  \nSt. Mary's has gotten worse since losing Dellevadova.\n\nAt least in the MWC they're consistently a 2-3 bid Conference. Zags make it a 3-4 bid Conference. They had up to 4 projectes to get in at one point. Take Gonzaga out the WCC and they're a 1 bid Conference period without question. Gonzaga inflates that conference. Put them in the MWC and it gets a bigger boost. The WCC is soft, they were not physically prepared to go against Baylor after a huge mental physical test against UCLA, think about it from EST, they've been living in that time Zone for a month. Played a big tough game against UCLA till Midnight EST don't get to best till 1am. They had no legs. That's a lack of competition. Beating USF down by 50pts and beating all these teams by 20 or more just about every game does them no good. If they lose to anyone but BYU they don't get a 1 seed guaranteed, they have to go UNDEFEATED in the WCC to get a 1 seed and win the regular season crown and the post season crown. Every single year. What do you ever learn almost never losing to your conference opponents? Rob Sacre on his podcast mentioned maybe even go Independent... But that's a whole other realm. \n\nMWC is at least a step up and has more potential to become even better with Gonzaga being in the conference increases the potential of competition and schools like UNLV have bigger potential to become better. I did the KenPom and NCAA NET rankings it looks better in the MWC.",

I'm thinking about transferring though, but before I decide I need to find out more about the CPSC program at Gonzaga; I've heard some things, but haven't been able to find out any specifics. Help me out? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the program at Gonzaga? Thanks!",

That's definitely a good point about the scheduling; this semester I had to drop an activity I really enjoyed to take CPSC121, and if I were to stay next fall, I would have another conflict with two classes that are only offered at one time :/",

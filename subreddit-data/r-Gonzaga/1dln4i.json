    "postText": "Hey guys, it's been exactly 2 weeks since I submitted my transfer application for fall, and almost as long as when the supplemental forms were sent. I'm not expecting to have received an acceptance/rejection letter by now, but I was hoping to at least have received an ID number so I could check my application status online. Did anyone else apply in the last month or two and in the same boat?\n\nJust getting antsy because WSU has already offered me a spot, but the deposit is due within the next 14 days and I'd really like to see where I'm at with Gonzaga without unnecessarily calling up and bugging them.",

There is a possibility that they are delaying it until they have a better understanding of how many freshman will be enrolling and whether or not there is capacity for more transfers.\n\nCompletely speculation. Why don't you just call admissions? ",

Looks like we'll be cutting it close, but it'll be in time!",

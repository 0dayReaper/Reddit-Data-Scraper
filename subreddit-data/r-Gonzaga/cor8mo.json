It can be pretty wild and if you\u2019re looking to party as a freshman, CM or Desmet will definitely be the places to go. It\u2019s generally a pretty welcoming place (as long as people keep their doors open during the day), and certain rooms will be the party spots on the weekend. Just be careful about getting written up by the RAs if you\u2019re going to party - it happened to me twice in CM. Have fun, be safe, and enjoy it! Gonzaga is a great school.",

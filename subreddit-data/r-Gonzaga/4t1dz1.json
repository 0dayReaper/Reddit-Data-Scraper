But if you're a girl just keep an eye out for the \"frat\" parties and you'll have no trouble. \n\nNormal houses can go both ways. My friends house has a pretty open door policy with girls whereas last year my house tried to take a more strict approach to people we've invited and their plus ones (which can pretty quickly turn into plus fives) after we had some stuff stolen and broken. Just be nice and respectful to the hosts, keep an ear out and it won't be hard. ",

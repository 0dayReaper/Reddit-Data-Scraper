    "postText": "I know Reddit might not be the best place for these questions, but I am a freshman this year trying to figure out exactly how housing works. I plan on living in Kennedy (although I am flexible and I know there are no guarantees), but I do not have a solid group of five other friends who are all the same gender as me. Can I get a room with a few people and then have random roommates? And either way, how have people\u2019s experiences going random sophomore year been because I am not even sure I will live with my current friends next year. Any insight is greatly appreciated",

The rooms are not designed for 2 people so they tend to be a bit small. I would advise Corkery Burch Dussault over Kennedy. Additionally yes you can fill only a few beds and have the rest be random. I\u2019m hoping to run a \u201croommate matching\u201d event sometime in the coming weeks so people can find others to meet with. Stay tuned to our instagram @gonzagahousing for more info. Feel free to dm me on there as well :)",

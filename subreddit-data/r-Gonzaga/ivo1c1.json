    "postText": "Hello, how difficult is the computer engineering here at Gonzaga? I know this major is pretty challenging but I'd like to know at what level is it here (like if it's a healthy amount of difficulty where you still have a nice/comfortable amount of free time sophomore/junior year with around 16 credits. What classes are the hardest too? (Calculus, circuit analysis, etc.)?",

            "comment": "I was EE and we shared quite a few courses. The major is hard, but I and many of my classmates had time to participate in sports, clubs, and other activities. It's impossible to say what class is the hardest. For me it was Engineering Econ. A lot of us struggled with the weird Thermo class they made us take. Just depends on how your brain works. Here are the degree requirements by semester so you can see how many credits you need to take: https://www.gonzaga.edu/catalogs/current/undergraduate/school-of-engineering-and-applied-science/electrical-and-computer-engineering/computer-engineering",

You can still have a bit of a life, but can't really have it all (sleep, clubs, partying, and decent grades) like you can in other majors. The job opportunities are hard to beat though.\n\nHardest class for my CPEN colleagues was probably embedded, but they also had a grad student teach the class which was a total shitshow.  Electronics, data structures, signals and systems are pretty tough, as is physics. The calc and diffeq sequence isn't too bad.",

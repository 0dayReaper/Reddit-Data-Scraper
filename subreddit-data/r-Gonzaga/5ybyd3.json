    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nI'm a daily vlogger.\n\nSince the new year I started making daily videos and sharing them on the internet while going to college here at Gonzaga University. I have grown up in the area and try to include the beauty of Spokane/ Gonzaga as well as the northern areas of Spokane into the videos I make about my life every day.\n\nMy real strength is the editing I do, and I shoot with multiple cameras and angles and a drone when I can.\n\nAre there any other vloggers or youtubers from the area? I'd love to meet you!\n\nFor anyone interested in my youtube channel: www.youtube.com/danielamann\n\n\n",

    "postText": "Hey /r/Gonzaga, I'm in an odd situation at the moment.\n\nRight now I am a WSU student studying CompSci, but I really want to transfer to Gonzaga. I just love the community feel of Gonzaga and the sports, and just overall it's more tight knit community (Intramural sports, clubs, etc.). \n\nBut here's where things get hard for me. I have a girlfriend that attends GU as well, and I'm scared that if we broke up it would be painful and awkward to be in that smaller community with her, especially since I was the one who transferred in... \n\nSO... I just need some advise, should I pursue the transfer app? I really want to be a Zag, I want to be a part of a community that is closer than where I am at now, and I want to be part of an institution that is more respected and I want to challenge myself. But I'm scared of what could happen with my girlfriend. \n\nHalp.",

You will get to know and see the same faces a lot, especially within your major and social scene. Also a majority of the student body are upper middle class / wealthy white kids from two parent homes. You'll see the same personality traits a lot. So get reasy for that. What that means exactly I dont care to explain in a reddit post I'm making from my phone before I fall asleep in bed. I'm a comp sci minor here and to be honest the program is sub par compared with what you might find at other institutions. \n\nAs far as your girlfriend goes, if you're already thinking about what would happen if you break up, it's not a good sign. Maybe it would be weird, maybe it would be fine. Maybe you would see each other all the time, maybe you wouldn't. We dont know any more than you do and probably less. \n\nGood luck",

There's nothing wrong with it. ",

I'm not going to comment on your relationship with your girlfriend. However, if you have so many positive reasons for wanting to come, then you shouldn't let fear (of anything) be stopping you. \n\nLike this other guy was saying you do get to see the same faces a lot, especially in your major. I really enjoy it though. You get to know the people in your classes and often all end up working in the labs together the night before anything is due (at least in Mechanical Engineering). It's a good time. I guess you do run into a bunch of kids from wealthy families, but not everyone is like that. It's no big deal if you don't let it get to you. My family definitely isn't wealthy. But I'm working my ass of to do what I love up here and it's definitely worth it!",

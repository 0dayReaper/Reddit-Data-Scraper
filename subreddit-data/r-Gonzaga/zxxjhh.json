My friends and I think it looks like a good option at surface level because of the single rooms and apartments but are wondering what is most important that we should know. Thanks for any advice!",

Very competitive to get because some are reserved for students with disabilities \n\nIf I were a junior or senior I\u2019d opt for off campus.",

            "comment": "Sharp is definitely an interesting building. It\u2019s old and kinda weird location being behind cotaldo. Like you step out and it\u2019s just parking lot and building so it\u2019s not very pretty. The building is old and outdated but it\u2019s fine if your cool with basics. I didn\u2019t live there but had friends in 3 different apartments there so spent a lot of time there my sophomore year. Their place was always the hang out spot since they had the living room and kitchen. Vibe wise was always interesting, it was easy to be involved in what other people were doing opposed to dussault or Kennedy since everyone\u2019s door faced the same way and you could see everyone\u2019s apartments walking up. In general it just felt more community oriented compared to other apartment options on campus which I loved. Location was great, I believe it was pretty cheap comparatively so that\u2019s a plus. If I were you I\u2019d totally live there, the pros out way the cons imo and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a good time",

    "postText": "Throwaway account.\n\nI'm thinking of applying to Gonzaga to teach in the history department, and I'm hoping some of you might be able to help me out.\n\nCould you provide me with some information about what you like and dislike about studying history at Gonzaga. It would be useful to know which are your favorite classes, what you like and dislike about them, and how you feel about World Civ II?\n\nIt would also be really helpful if someone could share a syllabus with me. I'm looking to see what kind of reading and writing requirements you have. \n\nConsidering the tight the job market for history profs, I'd like to make a good show if it. Your answers will help me tailor my application.\n\nCatch ya later, fellow kids!",

            "comment": "Are you applying as an adjunct (some of whom teach the core World Civ classes) or as a full professor?\n\nI graduated Gonzaga nearly a decade ago (history/political science double major), so I can't provide a syllabus or get into too much detail on the like/dislike, but can give my thoughts.\n\nA number of the professors I had between 2004 and 2008 are still there: Balzarini, Chambers, Cunningham, Donnelly, Goldman, and O'Connor (other current faculty may have been there at that time, but those are the ones I had who remain there). All are passionate and effective. Should you work at Gonzaga, you'll have fantastic coworkers in the history department.\n\nUnfortunately, teaching World Civ II, you'll be somewhat teaching to the lowest-common-denominator. It's a core class, and the fact of the matter is that most of your students just aren't going to give a shit about it. The ones who *do* give a shit about it, your freshman history majors, are largely already going to know much of the material from highschool (if I recall, even AP European History only tests you out of one of the World Civ classes). So you'll likely need to work hard to keep those students interested (I recall my adjunct prof, who I ended up having an enduring friendship with, did a *lot* of teaching activities--mock trials, breakaway groups, group presentations, etc.).\n\nIf you stick it out, though, and have an opportunity to teach some other courses in the future (assuming you're not applying as an adjunct), it'll be well worth it. Gonzaga grants its professors--even relatively new professors--a lot of freedom. I remember Donnelly teaching a \"History of Organized Crime,\" because it was one of his passions. There were a lot of mob films, and every student did a project on a different organized crime group. It was a lot of fun. You'll definitely eventually get the opportunity to teach your passion.\n\nI took every class I could from O'Connor--mostly Russian history, but he also took over Stackleberg's Nazi Germany course. The man teaches mostly through lecture, but damn did I find his classes informative and captivating. So I guess what I like about classes: a professor who is clearly passionate about the subject matter and a lot of detail and nuance.",

            "comment": "Currently in HIST201 (History of America, pre-Civil War). I haven't taken World Civ I or II so I can't provide a syllabus, however my professor makes us read and write a lot (though I think she's not the norm). \n\n\n\nRight now, from what I've heard, our history department could use a revamp--a lot of the professors are dry and seem to be losing their passion for teaching history (not their passion for the material, just the passion for actually teaching it). That being said, every history class is full every semester because it's a Core requirement, so definitely bring up the fact that you'd be allowing more students to take the class and preventing people from being frustrated. \n\n\nI, personally, hate discussion-based classes (which is why I don't love my current history class--we have \"discussion days\" where we literally talk the entire class and it's awful) and I love classes that do hands-on activities and movies and stuff where we aren't being lectured at or having to discuss stuff in front of the whole class (basically, projects are great. Having a full class discussion on how the idea of the Republican Motherhood was important to the Revolutionary War and how it started feminism when the professor is clearly a Liberal Feminist and I [also a female] am hard-core republican isn't a great idea because she also is highly biased in her grading (though she says she isn't). Basically, don't do discussion days if you've shown where you stand politically.)\n\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know!",

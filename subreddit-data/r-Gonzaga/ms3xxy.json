    "postText": "I've been dealing with this God forsaken program for 5 semesters now and it is straight up terrible. My friend who goes to Yale has showed me their registration and it is gorgeous, it has all the classes laid out nicely with all the requirements they meet as well has the workload, and student reviews right there. And the best part is it was entirely designed by CS majors from their school. If there are any CS majors reading this as annoyed with our registration as me I implore you to do something about it. Maybe this is something you could do with some friends for a senior project? And while we're at it, IMleagues is trash too.",

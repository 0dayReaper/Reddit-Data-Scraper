    "postText": "Hi! I was recently admitted to Gonzaga and I\u2019ve yet to commit but I was wondering if there are (preferably non public) pianos that are available to practice on? I love the piano and I really want to continue studying it in college but I\u2019m taking up accounting and will at most minor in something music (or I\u2019m considering a double major but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible). Is there anywhere I can practice, or does Gonzaga offer private lessons to students majoring outside of the music dept? Thanks:)",

The department was very friendly and even if you aren't taking a specific class, I bet they would give you access.",

I'd go to the music mansion on campus and speak with the people there. There are some practice rooms in the basement there and there are some in the building across the street with decent pianos.",

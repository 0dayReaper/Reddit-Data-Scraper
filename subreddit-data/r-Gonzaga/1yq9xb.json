    "postText": "I was ecstatic to be recently accepted Gonzaga for so many reasons. I love the Jesuit tradition of service and leadership, the location, the class size, and the programs. I visited the school last fall and really loved the atmosphere as well. I felt like I could feel at home there and that I would find a sense of community. But now...I'm having second thoughts. After really thinking about it, I'm starting to question if my background, interests, and 'personal stereotype' will fit well with the rest of the Gonzaga population. Here's my reasoning.\n\n1. I've never played sports, and I'm not a huge sports fan. Don't get me wrong, I love going to games when I have the time, but I'm not very familiar with any teams or players, nor am I super interested in investing myself into that. I'd love to go to the Bulldog games just for the fun of it, but I'm worried that I'll be isolated from that community because I won't worship the players, and obsess over the teams progress. \n\n2. I come from a single parent, low income family. I'm coming to Gonzaga on a lot of financial aid, scholarships, and many paychecks saved. I know that Spokane has its fair share of low income neighborhoods but deductive reasoning tells me that I may not have a lot of background in common with the students at a private, catholic, alumni funded college. Again, I worry that I won't be able to relate to students who have grown up comfortably, or won't relate to the situation I come from. \n\nI guess I'm looking for someone similar to me to just fill me in on how you're experience has been at Gonzaga so far. Should I be worried? ",

            "comment": "Not at all. Gonzaga has a pretty diverse student body and there are all sorts of people here. You will find plenty of people like yourself. I came to gonzaga and I had never even watched a basketball game before ever. I went to games, learned a few of the players names but no one like quizzes you about the history of basketball or anything like that so its not like you have to study up on sports or anything. \nIts true that a lot of GU students are from well off families and stuff but there are also plenty who are here on scholarships and financial aid. I know I am, its not like anyone asks me about my financial background or anything and I dont go around asking people how much their are worth etc. \n\nBasically if you liked the atmosphere and the school there is no reason you wont fit in here.

Its nice that its such a small school because I am good friends with everyone in my program, I am a senior, and I am also a business minor and I see people from those classes and still say hi when I pass them on campus. I have never really felt that anyone has been super rude or anything like that. Generally everyone is pleasant, hold open doors, etc. Great community feel.  ",

Unathletic, not religious, CS/tech interests, came from a modest background.\n\nI was very welcome for my entire time there and had no problem making friends.  For one thing, the campus community is large enough and diverse enough that I guarantee you can find people with similar interests.\n\nI can't speak for everyone, but I was a pretty odd duck as far as the typically GU student goes, and from day one I felt accepted and had no problem finding a group of friends to fit in with.",

I came from a similar low income situation and while I didn't have an issue fitting in, Gonzaga has a ton of trust find babies who get checks from daddy every semester to do what they would like to. It just kind of sucks having everyone go to Cabo and Whistler and Vegas when you have to save for rent. Gonzaga can also be very clique-y. Reminded me a lot of high school when I first got here but I just roll with it now.",

Between the Hogan and CLP program (check em both out, May require applications now) I felt like Gonxaga was a good fit. The challenge is that Gonzaga is full of preppy and judgemental people. You'll have to find friends who aren't like that, and it can sometimes be challenging. Getting into programs and clubs with good people will be the best way to make connections and this is the same with every college not just Gonzaga. ",

            "comment": "Gonzaga is a perfect example of college being \"what you make of it.\". You don't have to be into sports. I know some friends that loathe the basketball players being self-righteous/entitled and how the school favors them over other sports and clubs. There are things like GUTS, symphony, culture clubs, etc. that you can participate in. Just because you've never played sports doesn't mean you shouldn't try! Volleyball, softball, kickball, or soccer are all easy sports to get into for intramurals (Gonzaga boasts one of the better intramural programs for a private school ^(on the west side)). There are skill level leagues from the lowest of D to the most competitive of A. While there are occasional sandbaggers (those that can play at A/B but play at C/D) overall it's a great way to meet new people and to have fun (besides those 11 pm games where it's 17 degrees out).\n\nTo add on what to /u/WestSideZag said (and to reconfirm what everyone else said), diversify your friends, don't stick with one group. I'm not sure if it's better or worse than any other college/school but it can get very clique if you only identify with one circle of people. There's nothing wrong with doing so, but I've seen friends recieve the short end of the stick of such a scenario. e.g. Close friends not being close friends anymore simply because the group *cough*club*cough* they hung out with ostracized the other (hyperbole really, they just didn't talk as much and weren't involved). To which I tell them, they are probably not good friends in the long run anyways if their friendship was worth only that much.\n\nYour social/political/economical status outside of school doesn't really matter too much. People don't ask or care. There's nothing wrong with declining on going on a ski trip with others for the weekend because you can't afford it (I only went on a ski trips through a club and that was subsidized through fundraising and the like). You get all shades of people from those that go out every night, and the middle eastern kids that drive nice cars (most of them are really polite, although they tend to whine to the refs and play way too seriously when it comes to soccer), to those that are part of tons of clubs that seem to be always busy planning the next event. I'd say more than money, time is the most valuable resource/asset at your disposal, and everyone is allotted 24 hours a day.\n\nIf you want to party, you can find places to do that. If you want to ski you can find places to do that. If you want to volunteer, there are many opportunities for that. If you just want to study and focus on school that's perfectly applicable as well. College is what you make of it and Gonzaga can definitely cater to a plethora of different interests.",

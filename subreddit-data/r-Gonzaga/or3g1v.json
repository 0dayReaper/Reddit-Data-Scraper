    "postText": "I\u2019m an upcoming freshman this fall and I was placed in the DeSmet dorms. I\u2019ve heard from some alumni that DeSmet has a bit of a \u201cbro-y\u201d reputation, where all the athletes go and almost like a frat which isn\u2019t really my scene. I also think a regular coed dorm might be more fun. I do know that DeSmet has a great local in the middle of the campus. Any advice? Is the it\u2019s reputation accurate? What\u2019s it like?",

C/M seemed the chillest, and would be my recommendation if you want co-ed and not bro-y. \nI was in Crimont, Welch, Dussault, and then off campus for Senior year.  I realize the first two won\u2019t help you, but can highly recommend Dussault in a couple years!  Good luck new Zag!",

I had friends from DeSmet from all walks of life, but the bro culture definitely dominated there. \n\nFWIW, I lived in roncalli-&gt;coughlin-&gt; corkery x 2. If I could go back and do it again, I\u2019d do it the exact same way. I\u2019m still friends with most of the roncalli guys and many of them were in/at my wedding. \n\nGood luck and go zags!",

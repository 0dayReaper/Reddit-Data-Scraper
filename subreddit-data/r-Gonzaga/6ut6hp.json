I don't live there (in Goller, so roomier for the most part) but it's so compact that I imagine bunking/lofting beds is almost a requirement.",

The building is kind of shaped like a coffin so there aren't many square rooms. If you live in a corner room like I did, then you might be forced to bunk your beds.",

Ps let us know what you think.\n\nEdit: To clarify, some were distributed last night others will be done during the day today (12/9) so if you looked for one this morning and nothing was there check again later this afternoon. And again, as we are funded by ourselves, printing was limited so if you want one and missed it just let me know.\n\n**EDIT 2** Here it is. Formatting didn't completely transfer well onto imgur but it's the best we could do. [Enjoy!](http://imgur.com/MgkyA)",

We did put out about 200 to known GU houses with a request to read and pass on in hopes of circumventing this problem.",

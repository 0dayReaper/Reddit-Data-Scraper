Also I gave a strong letter of intent saying that this school was my first choice and have had an interview with an admittance counselor. Additionally, the last time I checked there were 148 people on the wait list. Is there anyone attending Gonzaga whose been admitted off of the wait list?",

My roomie had a lower GPA but a higher SAT score (he's smart, just incredibly lazy) and got off the waitlist.  Since you have an interview, I wouldn't call it off just yet.  Good luck!",

Also, reach out to the debate coach at GU, they are always looking for new people.  \n\nKeep your head up and don't stress too much you've got Nationals to prepare for!\n\nSource: Class of 03",

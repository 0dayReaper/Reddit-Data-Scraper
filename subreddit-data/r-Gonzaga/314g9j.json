    "postText": "I am an alumnus of UW and follow collegiate basketball a good deal.\n\nMark Few has reached one elite 8 during his tenure and it was a blowout. \n\n2 times that I can recall, he was was out coached (I believe both were sweet 16 games. Could be wrong on the Texas Tech game).\n\nFirst, there was the infamous UCLA game where Morrison got trapped and panicked. UCLA stole the ball and the Adam Morrison crying meme was born.  How that play went down appeared to be a player caught in a situation he was not prepared for. I don't think Mark Few gave directions for certain contingencies that were likely to happen. As a result, Gonzaga went down. \n\nThen there was the game against Texas Tech and Bobby Knight. Gonzaga and its talent had no business losing that game. I can't remember the specifics but Bobby Knight won that game and Mark Few lost it. \n\nAnd now this elite 8. Gonzaga has a cache of talent and it can't compete against Duke.\n\nAny other elite program, and Gonzaga is without question an elite program, would be clamoring for the head coach's head. Why doesn't Gonzaga and its boosters demand the AD make a bold coaching move and pay someone top dollar to take this program to the next level? I have never seen a fan base so content with regular season  dominance and post-season failure. \nOr is the mood different on campus? A google search for \"fire Mark Few\" produces a FB page with 40 acolytes. \nCan the GU fan base explain why Few seems to be inoculated from criticism?",

            "comment": "Seriously? First of all, the score of that game does not reflect on how close it was. It was a game of lead changes, and we got cold at the end, and it looked worse than it was. \n\nSecond, that was the second elite eight we've ever been in. We are not a traditionally elite program. Programs that have been great for longer than ours might feel a need to clamor for a new coach, but we have only recently had success. We have been improving steadily for 20 years, and a lot of that credit goes to Few. We have some loyalty to him for that.\n\nThird, getting coaches as good as Mark Few is not an easy thing to do, especially for a school our size. Other schools have offered him considerably more money. Firing him for losing an elite eight game following a record breaking season and expecting someone better to come along is ludicrous.",

            "comment": "I would rise to anger if your arguments weren't entirely inaccurate and unfounded. Firstly, calling the Duke game a blow out is an idiotic sentiment. It was a 2 point game with about 5 minutes left before we started to foul them and couldn't hit a shot. I wouldn't consider that a blowout. Also, in the ucla game, Morrison didn't turn the ball over, it was J.P. Batista, so you're blaming the wrong player. Oh yeah, that was the same ucla team that made it to the championship game, so by no means was that an upset; we lost to the second best team in the tourney. \n\nWhy are we \"content\" with Few, you ask? Well, he embodies the Jesuit spirit that this university is built upon. He also never embarrasses us in a recruiting violation like Calipari and finds a way to dominate and succeed without the raw talent most programs of similar recent success get to enjoy. And as a UW grad, I'm unsure why you feel the need to smack talk Gonzaga's team when your Alma mater has the epitome of an underachieving coach in Lorenzo Romar. Coach Few would be able to go to several final fours with the amount of talent Romar has wasted. Remember the Brandon Roy team that was a 1 seed? Me too.",

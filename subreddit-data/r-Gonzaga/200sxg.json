    "postText": "I got accepted to Gonzaga back in December with a pretty good scholarship. I am still waiting on the Financaila Aid Grant, If I got a $11,000 grant from Gonzaga with my shcolarship I would be graduating with roughly $40,000 to $50,000 debt (Unless they give me more than they estimated they would in a grant). My Dad does not like the idea of having that much debt post graduation.\n\n\nThe other school that I would be looking at is Oregon State University. I really liked Gonzaga a lot more than OSU. Just that debt is daunting. I have heard that Engineer grads from Gonzaga got jobs relatively fast after they graduated, and that the Engineering School at OSU is a lot more selective.\n\nI am planning on majoring in Mechanical Engineering and going into Aeronautical. My dream job is to be an Aeronautical Engineer for Boeing (Another reason why I want to go Gonzaga). Any Gonzaga students or alumni have any advice to help me make my decision on if the debt would be worth it.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: I really appreciate the replies! It sounds like the debts at GU are more manageable than I thought.",

            "comment": "Do you know how much debt you would comparatively accumulate at OSU?  Also, check out the typical time to graduation at OSU.  4 years at GU may be cheaper than 5 years at OSU.  GU engineering has a pretty strong connection with Boeing, but not really with the other aerospace giants.  I can't really comment on how debt will affect quality of life, since I haven't made much of a start paying on my own loans.  Spokane may have more internship opportunities than Corvallis (but I am not really sure), so you can chip away at education costs while building your resume up to apply to Boeing.",

            "comment": "I believe two of my electrical engineering friends in my year got into Boeing. But I think it was more on the individual effort as opposed to the school having connections. Most of my peers got jobs by the end of year of graduating, some even had jobs lined up before graduation. GU also has a mentoring program where you can get an alumni mentor in your field of interest so that could help you secure/materialize a long term goal. /u/FTFYitsSoccer makes a good point at comparing overall costs. Unless you fail a key course, Gonzaga will get you with a degree in 4 years because the Engineering curriculum is really structured. I was taken aback learning that some of my friends in other engineering schools (i.e. other colleges) thought that 5 years was normal/okay.\n\nTaking summer courses in core subjects (english, philosophy, etc.) will help make the schedule a little bit more flexible, and will allow you to free up time for volunteering, internships, or a part time job to help with keeping your keep from exploding too fast.\n\nEngineers in general make decent starting pay as well. I had the option to not take any loans out but felt like I should have \"financial responsiblities\", so I took out some loans. I sort of regret that decision because with rent, internet, car loans, etc. made me think, \"I have enough responsibilities as it is!\" And I'm looking forward to when I'll finally be debt free thinking about the money that it will free up. But everyone's situation is different so it's hard to do direct comparison.\n\nWill you be doing grad school? What's the starting pay of the jobs I'm interested in? How many years will I expect it to take to get my undergraduate degree? Those are some of the questions you should weigh when deciding on the financial aspect. While a \"good\" school with connections might help, individual effort getting to know people will also go a long way.\n\nAs a final note, this is college, it's what you make of it. It's good to think about the long term, but don't forget to enjoy the college life and freedom. Take part in clubs, intramurals, etc.",

My dad advises me to not be in debt, but he said that he would not stop me from going to Gonzaga. \n\nI do not think I will be doing grad school right off of graduation. But I hope to go eventually.\n\nI am going to be taking part in clubs no matter where I go.\n\nIt sounds like the debts from GU are definitely manageable!",

            "comment": "I have around 40k debt from GU, maybe more. I am about to graduate with a civil engineering degree. I have not yet landed a job but I am not really worried about the loan. I will have to start paying it back 6 months after I graduate or once I get a job. In my own opinion student debt isnt that big of a deal because its a government loan and there are lots of options out there for paying it back, I think right now my monthly payments will be like $160ish per month, or less if I go thru a process and and change the repayment option. You have to remember that student loans are usually 30 year repayment plans and once you get a job, especially in the engineering world you will be able to pay your debt off in 4-5 years if you are smart about working and paying it down. \n\nAlso I would argue that once you are in Gonzaga it is pretty easy to get additional scholarships in the engineering department. I have gotten 3-5k per semester per year merely in GU engineering scholarships each year I went to school. Those are really easy to apply for and the amount changes depending upon the need but they are there to help reduce the amount you owe.  ",

I am already planning on doing extra-curricular activities no matter which college I go to. I just wanted to see what some of the people who had gone to Gonzaga had to say. What you are saying is pretty reassuring!\n\nI am planning on getting a job through the university, I was thinking of saving some of that money also to chip away at the debt I would have if I went to Gonzaga.",

                    "comment": "Your username is spot on. Here's why you should be concerned about that $40k worth of debt your graduating with. Your payment will not be $160/month forever. Student loan debt and medical debt are the only 2 types of debt that can't be discharged in bankruptcy. Lastly, student loan interest rates continue to rise. That $160 could easily turn into $400/month or more.... For the rest of your life. You should be MUCH more concerned about how you will be paying on something every month and how that might affect your future earnings, ability to have a family, ability to retire, ect.  To the OP: If you can go to school without loans, you'd be crazy not to. Gonzaga is no Harvard. Neither is OSU. You'll be getting same basic education without the crippling debt for the next 30+ years. ",

            "comment": "I would /assume/ you would have a better chance getting in with Boeing through Gonzaga as Boeing heavily recruits on campus for business students. I would imagine it's similar for engineering. For me, and many students, Gonzaga will be cheaper than a state school due to support. Last, you're more likely to get a competitive salary and less likely to be eliminated from some \"exclusive\" program at OSU that will make or break your earning potential. \n\nGonzaga is one of the top engineering schools in the nation. Can OSU beat that? I've heard its an engineering school but tbh I don't really know other than anecdotal knowledge from my fellow hs grads.",

It is looking like I will be going to Gonzaga if they come through with enough money from the Financial Aid Package. I have heard from numerous Gonzaga grads that they got Jobs relatively quickly in their field because of the networking that they can do.\n\nReally hoping that the money comes!",

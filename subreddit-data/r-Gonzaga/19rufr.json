The weather is wondrous compared to the midwest. The people? Incredibly cordial and forthwith. The city? Well planned, navigable, and spacious. I am pleased to be here and take in all washington has to offer. \n\nSuggestions please?",

It is insanely cheaper to make the ~40minute drive to Idaho and the drive can be pretty fun with friends. A car is also really aweomse to go skiing at Schweitzer or to go bouldering in the surrounding area. There's a climbing gym called Wild Walls in the city that has a pretty cool community. its 5$ on friday (i think?) for everything you would need and its pretty fun to go for a night. \n\nI would try to hit up as many concerts in the area as you can. Sometimes big people come to Spokane in between Oregon and Seattle. The Knitting Factory has some cool people come out but they are probably just things you have heard all over the place like Macklemore or Skrillex. if you're looking for more obscure bands you're kinda SOL I'm sorry to say. That's the one thing I've been pretty unhappy with Spokane about.\n\nFor SB some people leave and some stay. Most that leave take trips places with their friends as opposed to going home. \nI would say is for now try to meet some sophomores and juniors. The seniors are fun but will all be leaving in a few months. On weekends (and some thursdays) most people just go over to other peoples houses in the area to party or the bars by campus (not my preference.) There's actually some cool places to get a drink or some appetizers for happy hour in the city.\nSpokane is not a horrible place, but I can see how it could seem boring when first getting there. You have to be kinda imaginative. It really all depends on what you're into!",

They are all filled with awesome genuine people. \nIn Idaho there is something like a flat ~16% fee per bottle and in Washington there is a ~20% and a charge per mL. The charge per mL ends up being about ~3-3.50$ per handle so it adds up pretty quickly. \nLike someone else said there is Sasquatch. It's a festival at the Gorge (in between Northern Oregon and Seattle I think). The lineup is usually pretty killer and it is supposed to be amazingly beautiful there.\nI have never been because my home base has been back in California for the summer.\n\nSorry I wasn't very clear! Parties are pretty damn sweet but I'm not too hot on the bar scene. The other guy mentioned Jack and Dans and that's the place to go. In the city the bars have a much more adult atmosphere. Theres a cowboy (I think?) bar called Big Al's ~30minutes from campus that is supposed to be a fun, nice chance of pace. \nBecause you asked, my ideal night is a group of ~15-20 people at a friends house. Something where there's enough people to mingle / not know everyone and it's also not too crazy where it becomes a shit show. Some of the houses around campus frequently throw down but they are trashy in my opinion. Wet/sticky floors, lots of dark rooms, fogged up windows, and shitty wanna be DJs ruin these kinda places for me. \n\nA soccer club sounds cool, but most people who do sports join the intramural or club teams that GU offers. What are some of your other hobbies? For being a predominantly white, private university there's a surprising amount of diversity of what people are into. At school there's everything from really nerdy people to really preppy people. ",

Riverside state park is really fun they have great hiking and a nice frisbee golf course, i also like going hiking at minihaha recreation area down upriver drive, its gorgeous and there are always people hanging out rock climbing.\n\nGU kids def party but a lot of them will be gone this week. What neighborhood did you move to? we all live in Logan for the most part and if you wander around the streets on a thurs fri or sat night you can find a party. just BYOB and probably go through the back door\nBrowne's addition is also a really cool neighborhood and close to pleasant valley which has a lot of old hippies\n\nmusic scene kinda sucks...\n\nbut im proud of you for trying something new! keep it up!",

My full month+ has given me knowledge of what it is like to walk up and down division and browse downtown. lol\n\nI got an apt with a bud of mine just off of division where the road forks. I figure it would be best to just start at campus popular bars and then browse? I really don't know how it works here. \n\nI only saw this because there is a slightly different vibe than there was in Milwaukee and I don't want to just walk around like I own the place. Milwaukee was full of dicks that way... really bothered me... Spokane!",

Maybe just use a burner laptop.\n\nAlso, buying the older versions of textbooks is a major cost saver (this depends on what courses you\u2019re taking though). This is why folks recommend to wait to buy the textbook -- you can spend a week or two in class and determine whether you really need the latest/greatest textbook or if you can do with an older version. You can also ask your professors this question: they're not trying to get you to spend more money than necessary and may be able to help you.",

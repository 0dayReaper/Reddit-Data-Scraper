    "postText": "I\u2019ve been accepted to Gonzaga and I\u2019m heavily considering attending. I know that college is pretty abnormal this year because of covid, so I\u2019m wondering what Gonzaga has been like during the pandemic. Do you think that Gonzaga has handled the pandemic well compared to other schools? How many of your classes have been in person vs online during both the fall and spring? Are professors available for office hours?\n\nI also plan to be really involved with the Gonzaga outdoors club if I attend. Is this club still active for excursions during the pandemic?\n\nI\u2019m really glad to have been accepted, but the uncertainty of the last year is a little concerning. I\u2019d appreciate anyone speaking on his or her experience even if it doesn\u2019t answer my specific questions directly.",

Truly in that regard, it depends on your major. That said, the President has stated that he plans to have all classes offered in person next year. \n\nGonzaga has handled the pandemic very well. Testing is easy to get, there are quarantine areas, and we are now a vaccination spot. You have little outbreaks of course but they pale in comparison to the horror stories I\u2019ve heard from the big state schools that opened up",

Activities still happen but modified. \nSocially, campus is different but it\u2019s expected everything will be returned to normal by the fall so theoretically, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. \nIn the end, the school and the students have handled it well as the students know if they don\u2019t, campus would have closed.",

You can get into any outdoor adventure you'd like as someone here will know about it. I think they are doing GOOB for incoming freshmen this year and I would apply for that aswell (its like a week backpacking/biking drip with other incomers , lots of my friends loved it and make many connections during it).",

    "postText": "I was just about to make this a subreddit a few minutes ago after [reading this](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/08/grow-college-subreddit-competition.html) and thinking it would be awesome to promote this as a medium for everyone at GU to actively communicate about things.\n\nwhile there are certainly some open forums and ways in which we can communicate with each other, there exists no real online medium to vocalize issues, express opinions and collaborate. /r/gonzaga would be the perfect way to do this.\n\nalthough it's awesome that we're a little community of 36 readers, would this competition be something worth doing? i considered blowing this up on my facebook but then I imagined the university having a pregnant over unrequested publicity or using the name for marketing purposes that they didn't endorse.\n\ni've worked for virtually every facet of the university already and i've gotten enough facetime  as a cheerleader that i know most of the people in student affairs/marketing, so it might be worth addressing them before going forward with it.\n\nso, before i get all gung-ho by making flyers and promoting /r/gonzaga, a couple questions:\n\n* 1) is this competition worth doing?\n* 2) if so, do *we* want it to gain popularity? \n* 3) is it even necessary to ask marketing/admins about it first?\n\njust an idea.",

If we advertise r/Gonzaga we'll just create a board for GU to post about events, just like other Gonzaga organization Facebooks and Twitters. Let's not keep it exclusive but let's not advertise ourselves to everyone!",

    "postText": "Hey zags! I\u2019m an MS.Tax student who graduated undergrad at a different school in WA and decided to do Gonzaga for grad. I\u2019m super young to be a grad student (20F) but I want to make friends within my program. I\u2019m normally somewhat outgoing but I get really shy when I don\u2019t know anyone, and it\u2019s a little more intimidating since the other tax students seem to all know each other from undergrad. Any tips?",

Also if your program is offering an event of sorts, definitely recommend going to those and introducing yourself to your classmates. \n\nHope this helps! :)",

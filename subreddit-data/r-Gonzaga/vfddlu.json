            "comment": "I graduated 7 years ago with a Gonzaga engineering degree, so my advice may be somewhat dated. But I had a pretty solid GPA (3.8-3.9, depending on which classes you count), so I'd like to think I have some good pointers:\n\n1. Sleep. Go. to. sleep. I'm talking 8+ hours, every night, if possible. If you're hitting the books for long hours and getting 3-4 hours of sleep, you're wasting your time. No all-nighters, and especially not before tests.\n2. Breathe. Sometimes the workload may seem overwhelming and you may feel there won't be enough time to get it all done. This isn't all the time, but there will certainly be a couple weeks each semester that seem out of control. If you can develop good time management, you'll learn to combat this anxiety by breaking down your workload into manageable chunks you can knock out one by one. (For example, this could be as easy as spending 30 minutes on Sunday evening or Monday morning planning out your week.)\n3. Learn how you learn. Can't emphasize this enough. This is the most important one. Everyone's different -- some people learn best from lectures (I didn't... too passive); others learn better from reading textbooks and doing practice problems (that's me) or teaching others (also my preference).\n   1. Pro tip: Research on how humans learn has found people have 3-4 hours of  \"good\" / \"optimal\" learning each day, and quality and retention drops off after that. This means you're better off learning a little bit each day (3-4 hours) than cramming before a test (12 hours in one day). This is all very true in my experience, and I really wish I had learned this one faster...\n4. This is an extension of #3: learn how to test and how to prepare for tests. Engineering school courses are graded 60-100% on exams. Figure out what gets you in the zone before a test -- if that's coffee, pump up music, whatever, figure it out.\n5. Related to #1, #3, and #4: Alcohol ruins knowledge acquisition and retention (because it ruins your sleep).  If you're hitting the books for 8 hours a day and then slamming 4 beers a night, you may be having fun, but you're compromising your learning. You'll still learn, for sure, but not as well as the time you're spending should be earning you. I'm not saying don't have fun, but try to keep booze to the weekends or after any tests.\n6. Get to know your major classmates -- you'll need 'em. This happens naturally to some extent, as you'll be spending a lot of time together, but still worth a bit of effort (wish I had done more in retrospect).\n7. Park your ego at the door. There's a strange childish arrogance among some engineering students who think they're \"smarter\" than others because their major is \"harder.\" This attitude may help you justify long hours in the computer lab when others are playing frisbee out in front of you in the quad, but it doesn't make you many friends. If you venture out (you should) you'll find that there are smart people in \"easy\" majors.\n8. If you have any lab courses (which you will), learn what the professor and TA (if applicable) want to see in the lab reports. If I remember, there's never great guidance on what precisely they want to see (and how they want it presented), so it's 100% worth your while to talk to your professors / TAs to figure this out. Hell, when you're getting started in a new lab course, just bring a draft version of your first or second lab reports to the professor / TA and ask them to look it -- that's the easiest way to receive 90%+ (source: used to be a TA).\n9. Learn to write -- once you've got a few years experience in the workplace and some seniority, communication is easily 50%+ of your job. It's rare to find someone who writes clearly and succinctly, and even more so in the engineering field. GU is a liberals arts school, so take full advantage of that.\n\nI don't actually work in engineering (never did), but I think an engineering degree was a great decision -- comfort with numbers and rigorous analysis of practical problems will get you far in this world, however you choose to leverage it, and there are few better foundations for that than an engineering degree.\n\nIf you like learning and 'ah-ha!\" moments where a difficult topic finally clicks, you'll have a good time in engineering school. Good luck!",

I watched 'em all on TV, but I've always hated lines, and aside from Gonzaga basketball (which I've become a greater fan of post-graduation), I've never been a big basketball fan. So I just never went through the hassle.\n\nI did eat next to John Stockton at Arnie's once, though. Also, Arnie's doesn't exist anymore. Sigh.",

Should I bring one with four wheel drive? What brand of car? Should I even bring a car? Please let me know what you guys think! Thank you!",

            "comment": "As far as bringing a car, definitely do it. The pass is 100$ a year, and there\u2019s a lot of parking as long as you\u2019re ok with walking a few minutes if need be. The garage is great for the winter so you don\u2019t have to defrost your car. You definitely need one with FWD/AWD, and as far as brands go anything that will be safe in snow is good. Most people have bigger SUV/trucks, but I drove a AWD wagon and was 100% ok. They maintain the roads decently well in the snow. Just know that you\u2019ll need to wash your car regularly to avoid rust from the salt they use.",

I'm not a car person by any means.  \n\nThat being said, I haven't had an issue with it for over 50,000 miles (it's at 105k now), the AWD has carried myself and dozens of friends to ski trips across the entire western US, and I've road tripped in it during moves across 4 states totaling over 2000 miles while carrying everything I've owned inside.\n\nI can't think of another car that I would have rather had for that period of my life.",

    "postText": "Hey\n\nI'm a prospective student with some questions about Gonzaga.\n\n1. I'm a very devout Calvinist Anglican( conservative classical Protestant) and a Paleoconservative politically. ( huge fan of Pat Buchanan) I'm theologically and politically very conservative. I'm looking at Gonzaga because the Core curriculum  looks great, and  I've heard it provides a rigorous education. I'm looking to get a great education, and have my views challenged. That being said, I want a place that's tolerant of conservative views. Are there conservative students and faculty at Gonzaga? As I've said, I'm willing to have my views challenged. What I will NOT tolerate is the typical Social Justice Warrior. I don't want some liberal student telling me to \"shut up\" because they disagree with my views, and I don't want some liberal professor  giving me bad grades due to my opinions. Would I be fine at Gonzaga?\n\n2. How large are the classes at Gonzaga? I HATE lecture halls and gigantic classes. Are the Core classes lecture based or discussion based?\n\n3. Is the food at Gonzaga any good?",

Classes are tiny. \n\n3. I liked the food a lot. The cafeteria is new and there are lots of restaurants on and around campus. Go visit if you're interested.",

I don't think that anyone will care what your religious views are (I know an Anglican Calvinist who just graduated last year) but your political views definitely will be.\n\nIf anything, your professor might encourage you to share your views during class. Usually the person who is a devil's advocate against popular views in the class will become liked by the teacher as long as you are open to changing your views on some topics.\n\n2\\. Largest class I've ever had was 40ish students in a 100-level physics class. Most of your classes are going to be in the 30s, with English, Philosophy, and other discussion bases classes tending towards 20. \n\nBasically, I haven't ever had a class in a giant lecture hall. We don't really have those. \n\n3\\. Cafeteria food is cafeteria food. Your experience will vary. Mostly I think there will be a few things that are actually fine for each meal. If you want good-tasting food, I suggest heading off campus as none of our on-campus dining options are all too good.",

I wish American politics was like that as well. I'm not your average \"conservative\" who listens to talking heads like Limbaugh and Hanity. ( I HATE both of them, because they're boring and unintellectual) I am of the intellectual Right. I read authors like Pat Buchanan, Paul Gottfried, Edmund Burke, Russell Kirk, Francis Parker Yockey, Julius Evola, Robert Nisbet, Oswald Spengler, James Burnham, Sam Francis, and Joseph de Maistre. My favorite publication is Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture.  Would I be fine at Gonzaga? Also, is it true that Gonzaga banned the public from attending Dsouzas speech? If so, why? ",

                            "comment": "&gt; Also, is it true that Gonzaga banned the public from attending Dsouzas speech? If so, why?\n\nNo, the president did not do that to my knowledge. In fact, the president welcomed him quite cordially even though most of the faculty was against it.  What I don't often see is balance wrt politics, for example, D'souza was welcomed, but a countering view point speaker hasn't been invited to the campus.\n\n\nYou will be fine at GU. As long as you are respectful and mature about your views, and not afraid of changing them if better data emerges, you'll fit in well. Most of the folks I've met who are undergrads are from Idaho, Montana, the Dakotas... so likely as right if not more right than you. Additionally, the town of Spokane itself is pretty conservative, but I'm speaking from a perspective where I've lived in Boston, LA, San Francisco. I'd put it a little more conservative than Reno, NV, but less so than Boise, Idaho. How that compares to where you are from, I don't know. :)\n\n\n\nAny chance you can come up for a site visit, and ask these questions of some of the students and staff that are around? Hemingson is a great building to talk to idling folks.",

                            "comment": "Another thing came to mind for you. There was a recent discussion in /r/Spokane about just how liberal or conservative the area is. Because for you, you're not just marrying a school, but a region too. In general, Spokane is a nice enough place, and pretty balanced with a libertarian slant. As you move outwards, you find that things get pretty conservative pretty quickly, and by the time you're about 25 minutes out of town, you can see a lot of Confederate flags, and can interface with a couple local militias, which I think can tell a story there.\n\n\nMyself, I was a delegate for Sanders. My golf/shooting partner is a huge Trump supporter. What's really neat about the community, both GU and Spokane is that there is a lot of tolerance for the differing opinions, politically. In GU there is also a lot of tolerance for religious difference as well. I think a lot of it can be summed up pretty simply, \"You be cool, I'll be cool. We'll be cool.\"\n\n\nI think a place like that can work for a lot of people. On top of all that, I live on the South Hill of Spokane, about 7-8 minutes to campus on average. I also live about 30 minutes from where I hunt duck. That's pretty damn cool in my book.",

            "comment": "1. Both responses are correct that you will find liberal views at any institution, especially Jesuit. Gonzaga seems to be one of the more conservative Jesuit schools, namely due to the Board of Regents and Trustees who influence policies at the school. Spokane is fairly moderate politically or at least very tolerant of conservatism. In classes, you can hold an opinion as long as you can reasonably defend it. Not that you will be persecuted for it but it does enrich the classroom discussion to hear multiple perspectives. Regarding your faith, practice how you want; the school is great for different spiritualities. Every religion class I took challenged me- Catholic and politically moderate- in that I feel I have a better sense of my faith. The Social Justice requirements make you dig into the challenging parts of Spokane and lean towards service. Ultimately the Jesuit mission is to connect with others.\n\n2. The large majority of classes are discussion based. You can check RateMyProfessor to get a better feel of how a class will be before you take it. Some professors prefer lecturing and some of them are very good at it. \n\n3. The food is fine. Not great, not terrible. This is a personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. I would highly recommend learning to cook for yourself because I ate better and healthier that way. Cooking for your peers goes a long way. My personal cooking advice: a. Learn to make a stew or soup that goes well with watching Zag games. b. Learn to make a casual dinner with a homemade touch. Be it mac and cheese from scratch or curried vegetables, they are simple enough and leave leftovers. c. Make a fancy meal if you ever need to impress someone. Pork chops in a heavy skillet with a butter, garlic, and sage sauce is easy but looks and tastes gourmet.",

However, I haven't ever met anyone who isn't willing to discuss and learn about other people's beliefs. I seriously love how discussion-based everything is inside the classroom as well.\n\nClass sizes are TINY. Max size I've seen so far is 52, and the professor still knew my name and I still say hi to her when I run into her outside of class. I couldn't be happier with this. I would die in a traditional lecture hall at a large school. Core classes are mostly discussion based, with the exception of some of the courses, Philosophy 101- Critical thinking, for example, will be more lecture-based due to the nature of the curriculum.\n\nThe food is pretty great! There are a ton of options, even though we only have one actual \"food court\" or \"dining hall\" or whatever you call it. They serve a LOT of different things at each meal. Also, there's tons of stuff on and off campus if you're not feeling like dining hall food that night.\n\nAnyhow, good luck with your college searching! Gonzaga definitely is an amazing place to be. I love it, and I am counting the days until I move back in for the new school year!",

The career center at GU is borderline useless for non business type majors, so work on your own connections. In CS classes will give you a good foundation, but 90% of the important things will be what you learn on your own, in internships and through people you meet. If you find yourself saying \"but no one taught me how to do that\" then you're probably screwed.",

The need for practical things outside class is somewhat shared (typically you also need software engineering knowledge in addition to the computer science base you're taught). GU is a small school, with an even smaller CS department. At a large school it's somewhat easier to learn from your peers in social life, clubs and hackathons.  At GU it's hard to get a critical mass of interested individuals for those types of things, there are also usually only a handful of students in each class who are really on a level considerably above you (unless you're one of the ones who's on another level, because you're passionate enough to work outside class because you enjoy it).\n\nSo basically, you'll learn CS fine, but you'll need to put some work in outside class to learn things you might have otherwise learned from your peers.

            "comment": "What is transfer day? \n\nThere is GEL weekend in the next couple of weeks where students planning to come to GU spend the night with a host and get to see what Gonzaga is actually like. Many hosts will take their students out to parties, but realistically, if you're hosting a 18 year old over the weekend you probably don't party very hard. \n\nThe scene sucks relative to any large public school (so if you're looking for WSU bro frat culture, you're at the wrong school), and is major prejudiced against freshmen. If you don't know where to go, and don't know people at the party, you might have a hard time. \n\nLive off campus, because the housing department at GU can be a real pain. Bball tickets are easy and free, but it might require you to wait in line or camp out in the snow. \n\nBest thing: community, culture, programming and activities\nWorst thing: religious institution, spoiled &amp; disrespectful brats.",

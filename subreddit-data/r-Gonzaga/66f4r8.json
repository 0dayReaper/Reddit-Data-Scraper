If that means my friends being ok with me not going to a party with them, that's what they do. If that means my professors forwarding us all internship opportunities or scheduling extra office hours, that's what happens. Where Ivy's would compel you to succeed through the crucible of competition, GU enables you in various ways via the aforementioned community. I hope that's more tangible than the basic \"I feel at home here; the community's great!\" comment.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a sophomore coming to campus at the end of the month for fall semester, and I have some questions about the housing situation for the next year. When do sophomores usually sign leases for their junior year and when do they start looking? Also, on what websites do I find houses for rent in the neighborhood/near campus?\n\nI don\u2019t really get how all this stuff works so I\u2019m pretty worried. Thanks.",

We started looking around in August of 2016 by looking around ourselves and having a bunch of our friends who already had places ask their landlords if they had any other places in the neighborhood. Ended up finding a place to get all 7 of us accommodated in October of 2016 and moved in at the beginning of May of 2017. A lot of people already had their houses locked down before us.\n\nGonzaga sponsors an online, off-campus housing board for landlords and Housing and Res Life to post.

It bit my group in the ass because we had some drama in our housing group, then still had to live with him despite a lack of resolution/restitution. Long story short, you really need to get on finding roomies and signing a lease ASAP :/",

If you are interested in participating, please email [covid.mh.study@gmail.com](mailto:covid.mh.study@gmail.com) with your name and preferred email address and cell phone number.

Participants in the second phase of the study will be asked to complete surveys at the start of the study and then again at one-month and three-month follow-up periods. For completing each follow-up survey, participants will be placed into a raffle to win one of ten $25 Amazon gift cards (up to two raffles possible per participant).\n\n**More information:** This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at The Pennsylvania State University.

    "postText": "Hey, I'm a Dual Enrollment student at Gonzaga and I'm signed up to take CPSC 122 this semester with Paul De Palma as the professor\n\nFor whoever has taken it before - what is the class like exactly? What is the teacher like? I heard that the programming language used is C++? I've only really worked with Java before - should I try to learn C++ myself before hand? Do I need to download any software before hand?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "DePalma is scattered to put it mildly. Good luck. C++ is pretty easy to learn from knowing Java beforehand and the class material is all in a textbook that\u2019s combined with 121 so you can easily review. Gaddis 8th(?) edition of C++ fundamentals is the textbook. It\u2019s easy to find a pdf online so I recommend that! The first day or so of class will be setting up your VM so don\u2019t worry about it too much",

That said, his teaching style is a little bit all over the place. You'll learn more from office hours and playing with C++ then from lecture.",

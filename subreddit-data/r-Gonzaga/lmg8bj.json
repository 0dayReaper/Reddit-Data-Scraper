There is a lot of work for us to do in our culture to address this, it's a big problem nationwide.\n\nI've never heard of people getting attacked on the streets or anything like that. Gonzaga is in a low-income neighborhood that is very run down. But overall it's a nice, safe, affordable college town. Similar to anywhere else in the world, everybody should be cautious walking at night, don't walk alone, etc. regardless of your gender or physique. Gonzaga Security has an escort service if you ever need a ride home and don't feel safe. I knew people who used it a lot and we're on a first name basis with the staff.",

Like the other person said, the cog(cafeteria) has food on Friday and Saturday nights and there\u2019s spike nights which puts on some random event weekend nights. Theres always trivia on fridays in the bulldog. There\u2019s usually a movie playing in the hemmingson auditorium every weekend. Tons of clubs and orgs to get involved in and everyone is usually super friendly. When campus isn\u2019t doing anything, the city usually has fun stuff going on, me and my friends would go mini golfing, bowling or go karting when there were no other options or just go for a walk and explore. Getting involved in things going on around the city is just as important and fun as getting involved in school and I highly recommend it. Made me fall in love with the city.\n\nI see you asked about rape culture. It happens, I had two close friends sexually assaulted while at Gonzaga. Both chose not to report because they just didn\u2019t want to so I don\u2019t have any experience with title IX but the support/therapy services (known as center for cura personalis (ccp)), is very helpful in dealing with a myriad of issues. There\u2019s also a very visible and empowering sexual assault awareness week which has many events surrounding the issue and really forces the community to deal with the fact that it\u2019s a problem here on campus. Overall I wouldn\u2019t say Gonzaga is worse than your average campus when it comes to sexual assault but it\u2019s obviously still an issue. \n\nIf you have any questions about anything happy to answer!",

There are hundreds (literally) of clubs on campus and many off campus organizations that many Zags are participating in. \n\nAlthough the \u201cvibe\u201d as changed due to covid, there is still a social feeling there. Before covid, campus was especially social for Lowerclass students as many live on campus. \n\nIf you are not the party type, there is a large group of people on campus who will host like game nights and other eventful activities that are not like house party type.\n\nI feel I am rambling a bit but TLDR: whatever you are looking for, Gonzaga has it.",

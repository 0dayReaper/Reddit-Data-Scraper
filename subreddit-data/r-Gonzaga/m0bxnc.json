    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nGonzaga is my top choice college and I really love it. The problem is I'm from Ohio and worried about living so far from home. \n\nStudents and alumni from the East Coast or the Midwest, can you describe your experience being so far from home? Were you able to feel comfortable and supported while at Gonzaga (\"home away from home\")? Were you able to find job opportunities closer to your state after graduating?\n\nThank you all!",

It\u2019s a great community (I lived on campus three years, and off campus Senior year), with plenty to do in the area.  \n\nI went on and did my masters and PhD in Scotland, but I\u2019m now back in Kansas.  It\u2019s a great school, with a good reputation.  I hope you\u2019ll love it as much as I did!",

I initially thought I was going to only apply to in-state schools and schools within a 5 hour drive but then I toured Gonzaga and fell in love; it was the only campus I stepped onto where I felt like I was at home. \n\nAfter graduation, I found a job in MN that I love! I was also able to do internships in MN and with the current state of the world, companies are being forced to get better at virtual interviews so you'll be in even better shape! If you do decide to go to Gonzaga, PM me -- I'd love to give you some more personal advice!",

            "comment": "There are other black people here, but very very few. Gonzaga is particularly good about lgbt issues but Spokane and Eastern Washington are experiencing growth in white nationalism and homophobia. There have been a few white nationalists stickers posted on campus in the last few years that the university has been excellent in condemning and removing. As someone who is currently attending and wishes that Gonzaga and Spokane had more diversify, there are downsides that would certainly need to be considered before transferring. Let me know how I can help, I\u2019m a senior currently here.",

I lost all my self-confidence my first year. It\u2019s a very gossipy school (esp. in the cultural clubs), everyone knows your business asap. You get used to it though and it does get better \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd",

I am transferring from a small school and wonder if academics at GU are rather difficult and time-consuming, specifically in the accounting program?

For that reason the accounting program is one of the harder programs at the school because these public accounting firms expect discipline and talent.\n\nEdit: work hard play hard as mentioned in another comment seems to be a very accurate description of what I saw as an outsider not in the accounting program.",

Junior accounting year courses are the most difficult you\u2019ll face, and they are no joke. Serious commitments and grueling exams. That\u2019s intermediate financial accounting 1 &amp;2 and federal taxation 1 and 2. Freshman and sophomore years aren\u2019t too bad, but more difficult than a less prestigious school. Once you get through the junior year courses it\u2019s relatively smooth sailing. During those junior year courses you will be putting in far more hours than other majors, but the classes are extremely valuable and the professors are top tier. I have experience in public accounting and it is clear the quality of education that Gonzaga gives. Very highly regarded program and rightfully so. CPA pass rate speaks for itself. Also, if you should to do the 5 year masters program, there is an almost 100 percent job placement rate for these graduates. I currently already have a position lined up for when I graduate at of of the big 4. This is very common for students in the program. You can hear a lot of negative discussion on public accounting or an accounting degree but there is no question how valuable and interesting it is, if it is the right fit for you. Feel free to message me with any questions you have regarding the program.",

One of mt housemates was an accounting major and so is my sister and they both say that it's not so much the difficulty as the sheer amount of material to remember so you have to study a lot.",

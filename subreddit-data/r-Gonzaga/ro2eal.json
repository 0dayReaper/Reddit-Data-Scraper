            "comment": "Talked to financial aid office when I was a freshman. Merit scholarships go up to 50% of tuition for whatever year you begin taking classes. Then they start adding other scholarships on top of that based on need. They are really good about layering on the awards if you talk to them. The schools statistic about like 90% of students getting pretty decent financial aid is true.",

I was so impressed about GU when I went to in person campus tour couple months ago. By the way, this is my first college I visited. After that, I told my parents that GU is the ONE for me although there is no way we can afford the tuition, room and all other expense. The hard part is being middle class. You made too much to qualify for low income but not enough in order to afford good private schools\u2026.\n\nI hope I can get good amount of aides (not too much loans) so I will be able to attend GU!",

            "comment": "I think the highest merit scholarship you can recieve (given based on grades, financial situation and other activities like volunteer work and clubs) is 25 or 30 thousand dollars a year. As well based on your FAFSA (primarily based on your and your parents income if your a dependent) a grant of up to 10 thousand a year (this is just as high as I heard it being it might go higher). Then they usually offer loans by semester up to probably another 10 thousand a year. As well you can get a discount of I believe 5% on tuition if you have a family member who is an alumni or currently attending. Gonzaga is pretty understanding with financials too, I've heard of people reaching out to the financial aid office and talking about there situation to receive more money although it might just be more loans.",

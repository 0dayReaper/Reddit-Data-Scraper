About the depth of 3/4 of a door. About 8 feet or so tall but has 2 doors about a foot tall on the bottom.\n\nDresser will be slightly wider, about 3.5 feet tall with 3 or 4 drawers.",

When I lived there there was a closet, and they may have changed it in the last 5 years, but what do I know.  The closet was maybe 4 feet wide by 2 feet deep.  If you were in one of the inner rooms, there was a weird chest of drawers outside of the closet that had maybe 4 drawers and was probably 4 feet high.  In the outer rooms the drawers were in the closet.\n\n[Here are pictures, fall of 2010](http://imgur.com/gallery/sduE7)",

Are there any weed out science classes?  \nAbout how many pre med students each year at GU? How many of them get accepted to medical schools? Quite a few of them or???\n\nPlease share your thoughts and advices if you can. Thank you so much for your time.",

            "comment": "CO 17\u2019 Human Phys here. It\u2019s been a few years but I wouldn\u2019t recommend pre-Med as a direction since it narrows your choices after graduation. A lot of the Biology people I graduated with are now in med school/finishing med school. A few of the HPHY people I graduated with are also in med school. It really depends on what you want to study while at GU. I enjoyed HPHY because it was really small class sizes, I graduated with 24 in my major and we got to know each other really well so if that\u2019s something you like then go for it.\n\nMed school acceptance just comes down to your grades/application. Of the people currently in med school I know, I believe almost all of them took a few years after graduation to pursue something else before applying. In the modern day I don\u2019t think it\u2019s common to get in straight out of undergrad unless you\u2019re phenomenal in every capacity.\n\nAs far as weed out classes, Ochem 1 was a big one. I went the HPHY route because I only had to take ochem 1 but biology has to take ochem 2 as well. The freshmen year bio classes were easy but also could be considered weed out courses if you didn\u2019t do the work. Again my perspective from HPHY was that we started with 60 or 70 and finished with 24 by sophomore year.",

I currently know two people in dental school (both ranked top 10) who got their AA in biology then went to university. One student only did one year of university before being accepted and he isn\u2019t going to graduate from college even. I\u2019m currently getting ready to apply and I wish I would\u2019ve gotten my AA first. From Gonzaga, I only know one student who went straight into the medicine route. Some of the brightest students I worked with all took time off. Pm me if you have more questions.",

Individual  mentor, committee letter of recommendation, MCAT prep. courses\u2026.   \nI know it is supper competitive to get accepted to medical schools, but what is (are) the most challenge reason(S) for GU graduated candidates?  Difficult science classes (hard to maintain high GPA) or hard to find shadowing, research opportunities\u2026..   \nGood luck on applying medical school! How many schools you are planning to apply? I hope you can get interviews soon and get accepted to medical school! Best wishes!\n\nThank you so much for taking your time and helping me!",

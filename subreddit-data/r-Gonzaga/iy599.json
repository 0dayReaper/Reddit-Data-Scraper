It's a paying gig and could mean you get to go to some of the big basketball games without waiting in line! If you would like to apply, or know someone who you think would be good for the roll, I would love to hear from you! You can reach me at JKelly7@zagmail.gonzaga.edu. Spread the word! Thanks GU Redditors!",

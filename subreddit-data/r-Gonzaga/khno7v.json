If you go out you are guaranteed to see someone you know. Also, people are friendly and while I wish that GU was somewhat larger, you\u2019ll find great people and great friends. I\u2019m still really close to some students there so I can always pop back over to Spokane when I want to. \n\n2 is that there is always something to do. Centennial is easy to bike. Riverfront Park and Kendall Yards are really accessible. Pretty decent hikes (depending on where you come from) like Palouse Falls, Beehive Lake, Iller Creek. Skiing on the weekends at Schweitzer/Mount Spokane. A ton of clubs put on events. We have programming every weekend with a free movie in our \u201ctheater\u201d or an activity like bingo, escape rooms, theme parks, skating, etc. mostly for free. Basketball games of course. Good bars, And there\u2019s a lot of food and Brewery options like No Li or Brick West.\n\n3 is that we\u2019re growing in brand recognition. With the hype we get from basketball, more people are starting to apply and it\u2019s getting competitive. Couple that with great academic programs and partnerships we\u2019ve made with other schools, GU is becoming a more known school and degree value is increasing. I\u2019ve noticed this as I\u2019ve begun my career.",

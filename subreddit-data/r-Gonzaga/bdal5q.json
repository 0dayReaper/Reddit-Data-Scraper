    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nThere's a chance that I'll be a freshman at Gonzaga next year, and was wondering everyone's experiences with different dorms? I'm kinda introverted, so I definitely want to be in a dorm that is social/will help me make friends because I might need help w that, but on the flip side, will let me sleep and have time for myself every once and a while. I was thinking CM or Madonna? Opinions on the best dorms? \n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I lived in the Ronc freshman year, CM sophomore year, and the Kennedy apt Junior year. Senior year was off campus at the Hami House (I wonder if that's still a thing...)\n\nThe Ronc was a small, foul smelling, cold, coffin shaped dorm where I met the best friends of my life. There was maybe 40 people in it, and nine years later I keep in good contact with a good chunk of those guys, including going to weddings and even being a groomsmen in one. That dorm was perfect for me. I'm not the kind of person who loves big social gatherings. I want a small, close knit group of friends, which Roncalli offered perfectly. I love the Ronc. \n\nMadonna sophomore year.....ehhh. Most of my friends were in Goller, the engineering suite style dorm, as well as my girlfriend at the time. Madonna was not much cleaner or nice than the Ronc. The fact that there were two floors of girls was cool, but I didn't spend much time there. The people I did meet were interesting to say the least....I didn't spend much time there so others experiences are more valid. \n\nJunior year in the Kennedy apt. Loved it! Super nice, very clean, had all of our best group of friends on the same Hall, just a few doors down from each other. Well worth it if you can get in. \n\nThere is no \"best dorm.\" Roncalli is probably considered one of the worst but it was perfect for me. All of the dorms have their reputations, stigmas, etc. Figure out what you want out of your dorm and college experience. Parties and drinking, go Desmet. Social butterfly, CM. Comfort, coughing.  An engineer who wants study partners, Goller. \n\nI'm stoked for you to be where I was at nine years ago. Gonzaga was the best four years. I loved my time there. I wish you all the best and hope you look back on your time there the same way I do. \n\nGo Zags!",

My friends from my hall will be my friends for the rest of my life. 3 of them were groomsmen in my wedding.\n\nThat being said my room was right next to the exterior doors and as such I didn't sleep well on weekends because people were going in and out at all hours of the night. If sleep is a higher priority than social activity then you might want to look elsewhere. I was able to handle it though, and earplugs and melatonin will go a long way.",

The people were so sweet, but the dorm is kinda old, and people refer to it as \u201cthe prison dorm\u201d so that nickname says it all. The walls are not even remotely sound blocking (you can hear your neighbor getting on to their bed) and there are so many weird quirks. Just try to avoid it haha. It\u2019s not the end of the world if you end up in there but!",

            "comment": "Hey, I\u2019m hopping on this kind of late, but Dillon and Goller were pretty great this year. The community isn\u2019t as built in, since it is suite style. However, it will just happen naturally. Plus, we have a study room on each floor, some pretty good accommodations, and it\u2019s almost guaranteed to be quiet enough to study/sleep. The rooms are slightly bigger than a lot of the traditional style dorms as well (except for Coughlin. Those rooms are huge). They\u2019re just close enough to the rest of campus that most buildings are a 5-10 minute walk at most without literally being in the center of campus. I\u2019m assuming your not looking for people who like to party, so being surrounded by Engineers/Sophomores is also pretty nice, since most of them take attending Gonzaga pretty seriously. Also, don\u2019t knock having your own bathrooms. A lot of the bathrooms (especially the showers) in traditional style dorms can get pretty gross. \n\nWherever you end up picking, I hope that you do come to Gonzaga. We can be pricey, but we really are a great school!",

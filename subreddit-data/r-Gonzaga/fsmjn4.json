Like literally every weekend there is some club event or a movie showing in our student center. Spokane can seem boring at first but once you start exploring and accepting it for a smaller city and don\u2019t expect big city attractions, you\u2019ll appreciate it. It\u2019s a really cool up and coming city with great restaurants and cool bar/brewery scene for when you\u2019re 21. Tons of outdoor activities within an hour including biking, hiking, snow sports, rock climbing and nice spots to hang at the river. At the beginning and end of the school year(when it\u2019s warm) there\u2019s always events going on around the city including Terrain art fest, pig out in the park, fall fest, various farmers markets, green bluff pumpkin patch/apple picking and more. There\u2019s also activities such as mini golfing and arcades which are fun all year round. \n\nOverall, Gonzaga and Spokane are great places. They\u2019ve both become very special places in my heart. Once you find your friend group and niche on campus you will not be bored.",

Being a freshman you\u2019ll most likely be in an older dorm unless you apply for coughlin. \n\nIn terms of fun, you will probably end up happy in any dorm you get. Each one has a great community and you\u2019ll find your people. CM and Madonna are the party dorms, mostly CM, or DeSmet for guys. I hated my dorm when I showed up freshman year, it was some small building away from the rest of the freshman but I met my best friends and ended up loving it. \n\nA lot of people will complain about the food but I think it\u2019s good. A lot better than friends colleges I\u2019ve been to. Many different options and unlimited when you\u2019re in the cog. There\u2019s always at least one thing that is good and if not there\u2019s always cereal to resort to. Salmon Wednesday\u2019s are the shit though and was a highlight ever week. Lots of other food options on and off campus too that you can use bulldog bucks for like Starbucks, several pizza places, mcdonalds, my favorite Clark\u2019s fork and a lot more",

Even though Spokane is smaller than Denver, you'll never have nothing to do whether that's on the campus or in the city. Within the Gonzaga community, you'll go basically anywhere and find somebody that knows about Gonzaga, whether that's because they're an alumni or even because they know somebody going there.",

DU is known for \u201crich kids\u201d and by coincidence or consequently, DU and everything around it is *very* expensive. DU\u2019s campus is not a \u201ctraditional\u201d University type/sprawled-out/student-centric setting or in a \u201ccollege town,\u201d it\u2019s more plopped in the middle of busy existing South Denver, right next to Colorado blvd which houses tons of non-collegiate businesses, and (fun fact) is the busiest and #1 policed street in the state of Colorado. DU is urban and does not have the welcoming, open campus feel, like say CU Boulder does. You can get lost in one or two blocks as the campus is small, within the city limits and like I already said, blends in with all of the other businesses and buildings around and within it. It is not a quiet campus as regular non-student traffic consistently flows on the main drag, called University Blvd. You see lots of older folks, who are not students, always traveling right through or working in nearby businesses/business buildings. It isn\u2019t in downtown Denver but is close. There are just a handful of DU bars (that are harder than usual to get into underage) so most students go downtown to party or bar hop. DU has a ton of \u201cdonated\u201d money, great scenery and offers a great education but does not offer the college-student-community that Gonzaga (seems to) offers. If you attend DU I highly suggest joining Greek Life or some kind of activity to stay involved and meet life-long friends. You can forget you\u2019re a student pretty easily, which can be both a good and bad thing. Also, if you can do a campus tour of each to help make your decision, do it.",

They got into some shenanigans because they didn't care about their school and knew the professors would just give them passing grades anyway.\n\nMy DU grad school education was fine, but I was horrified by the DU undergrads.

It's way easier to walk from Gonzaga's campus to downtown than it was to take the train from DU to downtown Denver.\n\nAlso, Seattle is only a 4-5 hour drive from Spokane and is WAY more interesting, fun, delicious, etc. than Denver! ;)",

I would say most of my friends were part of 1-2 clubs seriously especially when we were underclassman. There\u2019s also random events every week like free movies that are pretty new that show in the student center, retreats, and shows from the theatre department. They email students a daily update email where you can find all the events on campus.\n\nOutside of campus, if you have a car there are some hikes, camping, swimming and lakes that are around.  Plus you can always head to a yoga, or spin class, there are even a few places within walking distance of campus. In the winter there\u2019s some good ski places nearby, and there\u2019s a little bit of shopping and a few good restaurants. \n\nIf you like to drink, there are certain \u201cparty\u201d dorms and once your an upperclassman, basically everyone moves off campus and has a house to drink and play beer dye at. A lot of kids end up drinking and partying a lot in college and not doing a ton of the campus/ community things, but there\u2019s also a decent amount where the opposite is true. They want to be involved but don\u2019t care about drinking. You can find both here.",

            "comment": "Wow, that's almost exactly the choice I had to make too, except I was looking at CU - Denver. Denver is a really popular attraction just because there is so much to do, but I think it helps to determine what is really important to you in terms of your schooling and then figure out which school provides the best options for those items.\n\nFor example, how much does the actual program matter to you? Are you looking for something really specific to study? Each school may provide a lot of similar programs but the quality is going to differ between the schools. For me, I'm attending Gonzaga for the MAcc program which is ranked 25th in the nation I believe. CU - Denver offers a decent program, but it doesn't rate as high and is catered more towards online/part-time students. Since I wanted a full-time, on-campus high quality program, Gonzaga was the better choice in that regard. \n\nAlso, in terms of location, I did make sure to visit Spokane before making a decision. I'm very sensitive to environment, so I always do a vibe check when contemplating a move to another city. I found that I liked the city a lot better than some places I visited, so it would be doable for the 1.5 years that my program will last. Depending on the length of your program and what you like to do, you may find that isn't the case for you.",

It's not easy, but it is possible.\n\n Essentially, you'll take 1st year engineering courses and apply to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the end of the first semester based on your first semester grades. Talk to an academic advisor for more details, they'll be able to provide you with more information.",

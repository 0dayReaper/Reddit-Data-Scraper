    "postText": "Hey everyone sorry to be the lost high schooler but I'm pretty confused about applying. I'm a student who falls slightly short of the academic requirements so I'm wondering if I should or should not apply early action. Does early action make it more competitive or increase my chances?

I applied early action and got in with an academic scholarship. It's definitely worth trying, it shouldn't hurt your chances at least.\n\nGood luck!",

Honestly looking back at applying for undergrad (though I went to WSU and am now at the GU grad) don't stress, just apply. Plenty of kids get in without meeting the \"requirements\". Its not going to reflect poorly if you apply again, and if you are unsure or need more information just call the registrars or admin or whatever you need.  ",

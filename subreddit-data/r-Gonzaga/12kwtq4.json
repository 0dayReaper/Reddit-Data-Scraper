    "postText": "Anyone who works (or has worked) at Gonzaga here?\n\n1. While I'm assuming they pay all of your health insurance, how about your spouse/child?  How much did you end up paying for their health insurance? \n2. I see a document that says vacation time is accrued at 5 hours per pay period. Would that mean weekly or bi-weekly?  At bi-weekly, that's only 10 hours a month or about 15 days a year, so I'm hoping that means weekly!\n3. How did you enjoy working there overall? \n4. How's the air quality during wildfire season?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Former (fairly long term) staff employee here. Can't speak to the faculty experience. GU has 24 pay periods a year; vacation and sick leave are accrued semi-monthly.\n\nPros of working at GU:\n\nTuition benefit (for yourself ['free' tuition after 1 year of employment]; for your dependents [25% off after 1 year, free after 5 years]). 'Free' because comped tuition for graduate degrees is taxable income--in reality that meant I paid roughly one-third in taxes  the amount of my free tuition.\n\nWork-life balance (for staff in the academic side, not the student affairs side). My impression was that student affairs--depending on office--doesn't have the work life balance academic staff enjoy, but they also had greater chance at being promoted into middle/upper management (on the academic side, those positions are largely reserved for faculty).\n\nBenefits are decent (Gonzaga will tell you they're great. Okay.)\n\n\nCons: \n\nThe pay sucks, and there is no system to grant regular pay increases (for either time in position or merit increases). Most years they do give a COLA (it ranges from 1.5-3% the years I was there) but call it an 'across the board increase'. The only way to get a raise at GU is to change positions, or have your supervisor make a case that your job has changed so significantly that it is effectively a new position and should be reclassified (this takes anywhere from 9-18 months and is not guaranteed). \n\nThere are cultural problems that staff who have been there awhile are well aware of. Administration/management are (or should be) aware of them but do little to redress them. Human resources has consistently high turnover.",

I work in a school now and can expect 3.5% COLA plus a step up which is typically another 3.5%.  \n\nThanks for the info about pay periods and other details. If you have time, what kind of cultural problems did you see?",

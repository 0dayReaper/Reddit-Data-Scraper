If you're an underclassman I'm not sure why you would want to mostly shop for groceries. You're already required to buy a meal plan (ugh), the dorms and apartments are illequipped for great home cooking, and eating with friends is a huge part of the social experience on campus. Most of your friends may have meal plans that primarily have them eating at the cog.",

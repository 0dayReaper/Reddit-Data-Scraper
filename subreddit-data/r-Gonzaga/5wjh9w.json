    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nCurrently I'm a MIS concentration in the business school. Technology is a passion of mine, but I was wondering about the future job outlook within the industry and the job placement within the field after graduation. Are there any alumni that could share their experience about GU MIS or any advice about interning/gaining experience within that field. \n\n",

            "comment": "MIS is a really broad subject and unlike other concentrations there isn't a super clear career path. What are you interested in? The job outlook will vary dramatically based on what you want to do. Also, many people leave their area of focus and apply their skills to another area. For example, marketing and finance also need people good at system architecture, database management, analytics and data science. ",

Get your intern experience so you have a resume, go to the career center and work with them, and start working on your networking skills.\n\nFAST Enterprises comes recruiting almost every year for MIS Students if you want a coding job (I would recommend getting the Comp Sci minor if you want to do coding). Take summer courses at local community college to catch up and save money.",

Worked in computer programming for a small crappy company in Spokane right out of school then got in touch with some recruiting agencies and joined Microsoft as a contractor. Now I'm full time working as a business manager/analyst for Xbox. The SQL info you learn in MIS coupled with another business degree is a great start for analytics. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat",

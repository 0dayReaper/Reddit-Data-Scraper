Seems kinda small, with only 40 people. And I feel like coed would have been preferable too. What should I expect?",

I didn't personally live in the Ronc, but I knew almost half of the guys in there and would hang in there occasionally. \n\nThe room sizes are quite awkward as all the walls are in weird angles, but they have big windows, and can be divided into your side and your roommates side easily. the bathrooms (one on each floor I believe?) aren't the cleanest, compared to other dorms, but not bad. And the residence hall itself is a weird shape.\n\nWhat I can say, however, is that the community in the Ronc was awesome this year. If I knew the guys living in there before GU, I would have definitely considered living there. They're a super tight knit community with only forty guys, but you'll make some of your greatest bros there. It's also a really good location on campus. You're on the residence block with alliance (all girls) and Lincoln so you'll be close to those small dorms too, and it's close to the majority of buildings that house classes as well as Hemmingson.\n\nWith that being said, the environment of your residence hall really depends on the people who live in there. I know some residence halls that were quiet one year and social the next. I'm sure it will all go well. Welcome to GU!",

I've got a pretty dead GroupMe going for the dorm right now and I can pm you the invite if you're interested.\n\nAfter spending way too much time being frustrated with the placement, I honestly don't think it'll be that bad. The room layouts suck, it looks like a prison from the outside, and has an awful reputation, but so far everybody seems super chill. I think we can make it a nice place to be and I'm excited to meet everybody.",

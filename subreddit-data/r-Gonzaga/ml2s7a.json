Also big shout out to Kispert, Ayayi, Suggs, Timme, and any of the other guys who may not come back. Go Zags!",

Baylor clearly was the better team, but the Zags were still capable of keeping it very close or winning if they had worked as hard on the glass as the Bears did. Lack of rebounding effort caused the loss to be that bad.",

It is definitely disappointing to see us on track to be the second team to win undefeated in history, only to have that dream thwarted at the last second, but the fact of the matter is that we had an amazing season. And that shot last game by Suggs will never be forgotten!",

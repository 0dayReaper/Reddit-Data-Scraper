It was a tough choice between here and UW and I think I chose correctly :)\n\nPeople are very friendly and the student population is low enough that you can really get to know a large percentage of your class, which really helps build a sense of community.\n\nThe big downside of a smaller school tho is that we have fewer teachers and available classes so if a class you need isn't when you want / with who you want you're outta luck",

I came to GU with a ton of AP credit and the school of engineering only took the social studies credits towards my major, not math and physics and whatnot. Sometimes in those cases it\u2019s good to take those classes again but just be aware of that.",

The community is the best part of the place. Everyone looks out for one another and it is very tightly knit in that regard. The professors are fantastic, out of maybe 27 or 28 profs I\u2019ve had I didn\u2019t like maybe 1 or 2 of them. Campus is great, Spokane is quirky and fun. All around great place.",

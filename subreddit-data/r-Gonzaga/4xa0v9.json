    "postText": "Hey Reddit!\n\nI'm going to be a sophomore this upcoming year living in Dussualt. I'm excited to go back, but I have been thinking about housing for my junior year (I know a bit early but it has been on my mind). My friends and I were thinking about signing on a four person house for 2017-2018 by the end of this semester. The issue is, I am thinking about studying abroad the spring semester of my Junior year. I do not want to be paying rent on a house when I am abroad. How do I go about this issue? I understand try to find someone to sublease but how/where? Or I was thinking try to live in Corkery/Kennedy my Junior year (if my friends agree) and then let GU take care of the issue of trying to find someone to fill my spot when I'm away.\n\nAny advice/experience is appreciated.\n\nThanks!

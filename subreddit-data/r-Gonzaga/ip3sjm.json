            "comment": "As the article states they do periodically get reshuffled around, especially when fresh press is released, but I would think it is safe to assume the answer is very likely yes.\n\nI don't remember any official response coming from Gonzaga at the time, aside from probably declining to comment, looking into it \"very seriously\", doing nothing and stating that the diocese owns and runs the retirement center on campus. I highly doubt anything came of it. The church has made it clear they will not punish their own and will do everything in their power to ignore and hush away these cases to the best of their ability. And although Catholic leadership seem to be relocating known abusive priests to more isolated locations - this seems to be more of an excuse to continue to protect these sick bastards and shield themselves from further scrutiny - and this certainly doesn't mean they are no longer sheltering known abusive priests at Cardinal Bea.\n\nI am sure the current roster of residents is relatively available somewhere if you want to do some sleuthing to find out for yourself. But maybe they have tightened up more on that information since Spotlight days.\n\nIt is sad and sickening. And why I no longer identify with the Catholic faith as I cannot reconcile being a member of a church that turns a blind eye to their own evils and that is so brasion/open/defiant/stubborn in their hypocrisy.\n\nThat being said. It is good school. Best four years of my life spent here. Hope it doesn't tarnish your experience here.",

    "postText": "We all know GU's parking system is complete ass, especially when it comes to the lack of a free parking option. Fun fact: even employees/work-studies/faculty/staff have to **purchase** their parking pass from the university.\n\nThis year, with the raise in price of the parking pass, covid, and the fact that I only park on campus to go to work, I decided I'd had enough. I now park wherever I want and receive a $50 fine daily. My car isn't registered with the university, so they have no way of charging or placing a hold on my student account. For all intents and purposes, I may as well be a visitor who just can't get enough of the Hemmingson Starbucks.\n\nDo any of y'all have experience abusing the system? What are the chances they apprehend me or identify me through cameras? I'm not trying to have a hold on my account of thousands of dollars when I graduate.",

            "comment": "Hey bro. Someone posted this on twitter so I had to rush over to make a reddit account to respond. \n\nI did the same thing last year. My car was not registered to the school and I thought I could get away with evading the parking pass and tickets because they could not trace the car back to me. I racked up hundred of dollars of tickets and at the end of the semester was on hold because of the outstanding parking tickets. It was ridiculous. I figured out that Gonzaga can find out who you are based off license plate. They must have been able to look up or identify the owner of the cars through licensing and match it with a student/faculty at the school that is linked to car owner. One of my parents visited for the weekend and got a ticket and it was even put on my account because of their relation to me as a parent. \n\nSo sorry to have to inform you of this but I just don't want you in the same hole that I was in. It sounds like a genius plan, but fortunately you weren't the first one with that idea and I am glad I can hopefully warn you in advance. Best of luck man.",

I also find this funny because it costs a good deal of money and takes a considerable amount of effort to identify someone from just their license plate number (in a lot of cases it is even illegal: [source](https://findbyplate.com/resources/license-plate-owner/)). I haven't yet had a hold on my account nor have I received any charges to my student account and I have a considerable amount of outstanding parking violations. Thanks for the heads-up, I really appreciate it. In the instance they do end up figuring out who I am, hopefully the grumpy woman receptionist in the campo office will give me a pass if I flash my tits.",

They are well within their right to run plates so they can issue tickets or notify the owner of a car they\u2019re having towed.

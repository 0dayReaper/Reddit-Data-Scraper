    "postText": "Anybody want to talk about what happened in the Southern game?  The Zags never quite got into a rhythm, and I have to say the refs made quite a few no-calls on those blocks.  Olynyk stayed tough throughout the game and I thought the team as whole stayed composed even when it seemed that the fans were rooting for the upset.  Harris needs to step it up on offense and be a big part of the next game.  I also hope Bell or Pangos (maybe both!) can get hot shooting from the outside early for the next game, it would relieve some pressure off of Olynyk to be the main offense.  Dower can be an X factor, it'd be great to see him have a big game from the bench.\n\nThoughts? C'mon Zag fans, let's hear it.",

That said, I hope the cold-shooting is out of our system (Pangos began to step it up with Bell at the end) and we can pull in a win in our usual style on Saturday.\n\nHilariously, the law school prom is EXACTLY the same time as the game. I think a lot of people will be pissed off. I, smugly, didn't buy a ticket.",

At least there was that one no-call for Pangos when the guard drove to the basket towards the end of the game.  I think the refs helped Southern out, but I am extremely biased obviously.\n\nI don't think I could stand not to catch the game, I bet most people will have their phone in their faces if they're not watching it on TV.  \n\nZags better show up!  A later game, so a bit more prime-time.",

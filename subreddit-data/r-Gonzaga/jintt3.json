            "comment": "The only two majors that aren\u2019t direct admit are Nursing and the School of Engineering so you can declare a business major at Gonzaga and be accepted into lower division business. Before your junior year you have to take 6 business prerequisites and pass with a certain GPA in order to take upper division classes (with exceptions).\n\nOur business program is Top 23% in the nation. I wouldn\u2019t say it is the most recognizable compared to say UW Foster, but from experience, student outcomes come graduation have been very good. A handful of students have landed internships at reputable companies consistently throughout each year. Our accounting and finance programs are very strong. Just last year Amazon and Starbucks came to campus to recruit for their Finance Rotation Programs and Boeing comes every year. Lastly, our alumni network is strong because Gonzaga is a community oriented school so alumni are always more than willing to help when it comes to trying to land jobs at companies you want to work for.",

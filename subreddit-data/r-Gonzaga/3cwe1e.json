            "comment": "Lol so River Inn means that you are living in the Red Lion Hotel that is right by campus. Since the student body is growing so fast sometimes they don't have enough rooms on campus to house all the freshman so they rent out part of the Red Lion to use.\n\nIt's not a bad spot if you consider that it's a big and nice room with your own bathroom. However it is extremely far away from all the center of campus so that's a downside. Also I've heard that it can be a little harder to make friends in there so I recommend joining clubs and and things like that make friends. \n\nIt wouldn't be my first choice by a long shot as a place to live freshman year but every dorm is what you make it.

            "comment": "River Inn is the best possible room you could get by quality as a freshman. Your own bathroom, large room with a nice window, lots of parking (if you have a car), and a bathtub something no other dorm has. The real cons come from the location. You are going to be walking a lot. I would recommend a bike or long board otherwise it's gonna suck walking to class and meals everyday. In addition look at joining a sport club or some other society with lots of people in it so you can get to know people outside River Inn because trust me, you will get sick of seeing the same 30 or so faces after awhile.",

I met my current house mates in choir and you also meet a lot of upper class men and people who you wouldn't normally meet because of dorm, major, etc. I'm a little biased obviously but I think it's the best community for finding your niche early on. Let me know if you have any questions!",

Quick question, do you have any advice for the auditions err... what did you guys call it, placement(?) something like that, anyway, any pointers, I'm all ears because otherwise I really have no idea what I'm going to be doing for it.  I'm a Bass 2 btw.",

There's the men's chorus, women's chorus, university choir and chamber choir where chamber choir is a subset of singers from the university choir. The placement hearing consists of a range check, vocal dictation, sight reading, and then singing either a song of your own preparation or Amazing Grace/America the beautiful. It's pretty low stress and he'll definitely ask you which one you want to be in and take that preference into consideration. Practice sight reading a lot because that was the most important thing to him when I did my audition and I think it was one of the main reasons I got in. Also, be clear that you are invested in choir and are passionate about it. He doesn't just want people who can sing he wants people who can contribute to the community and the experience of the choir as a whole.",

Besides other red lioners when you tell people that you live there you are going to get the same expression the I'm sorry but hey at least you got a big room look, but honestly my closets friends are all people that lived with me in the red Lion. If you want any more war stories or tips about anything let me know. And if not I'll see you around campus. ",

I remember we would spend 30-45 minutes waiting in the halls for everyone to get ready (same 3 girls that we waited on) haha hallway talks was some of the best times. \nSomething that always seems to happen is someone forgets there id card and had to walk back. Worse feeling in the world. By the 2nd semester half of the hall got long boards they make you look cool and gives everyone a common interest ",

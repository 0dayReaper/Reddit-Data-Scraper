    "postText": "I'm a prospective transferring undergrad for the upcoming school year. It's come down to choosing between WSU and Gonzaga, and I must choose by the end of the week. I originally thought this was going to be a much easier choice simply due to cost alone, but with the aid that has been offered to me, they're both now priced similarly.\n\nThe only difference is my courseload, which I've planned out based on available advising worksheets. At either school I'll be double majoring in Accounting and MIS. Between Fall 2013 and Spring 2015, I'd be taking 15-18-12-15-15 credits at WSU, and 18-17-12-18-18 at Gonzaga, which is higher due to the required religion/philosophy courses. I don't mind the extra work and I understand I'll be sacrificing some of my social life because of it.\n\nFor those who were in a similar situation, what made you choose Gonzaga over a different school? And now looking back, would you have made the same choice? Are there other factors I should be looking at when I make my decision?",

But then, we may have differing opinions on what \"ripping me a new one\" is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt;compare average salaries for accounting majors and you won't have a hard time making your decision\n\nI'm not aware of a database of starting salaries that can filter by major AND school, but what I did was go onto LinkedIn and compared the amount of WSU grads vs Gonzaga grads working in Big 4, restricted to the last 5 graduating classes (average lifespan at a Big 4). Gonzaga has a higher proportion of students in this category, which is reassuring.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&gt; not sure where your credit loads are coming from. are you planning on five years? if so, you only need 150 for the CPA.\n\nI'm planning on finishing my degree in 2 years. According to the advising worksheets, for my double-major I have these classes to complete:\n\n[Spreadsheet with planned courses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiPTuxImrE5hdGVfSW4weEFuRlhOOHFSQ2RCN1VENXc&amp;usp=sharing) (Gonzaga Acct/MIS at the very bottom)",

I've verified some of the facts you've mentioned relating to the CPA pass rates and the ranking of the accounting program, so this is all very legit and persuasive. Unfortunately I don't have the full NASAB report (it costs $100) to see the CPA pass rate of WSU to do a direct comparison, but the fact that the WSU website doesn't list these figures or boast about their ranking like GU does is somewhat telling (albeit not conclusively).\n\nI have a few more concerns, if you or anyone else would like to address them:\n\n1. You mention \"the amount of resources and the way the program sets you up\" is superior to that of WSU. Can you be more specific? Both schools have the accounting-specific AACSB accreditation, both offer tutors, and both have BAP chapters (although the GU chapter website appears to be down).\n\n2. The social experience. If you've viewed my planned courseload in the prior post, you'll see that I am taking 18 credits every fall/spring semester (12 int he summer). GU also has a much smaller base of students. In my WSU planning I had planned to participate in greek life, BAP and other academically-based organizations, and other extracurricular activities. Although GU also offers many similar opportunities, my concern is the amount of time I'll have outside of my studies to pursue these opportunities. Thoughts?\n\n3. Grades. Getting into the accounting industry is actually my backup plan if I'm not admitted to a T14 law school. According to /r/lawschool , law school admissions in general are fixated on GPA (amongst other factors) and is considered of utmost importance with no regard as to the difficulty of coursework or prestige of the undergrad school (ex. a 3.8 from WSU would be considered more valuable than a 3.7 from GU). I feel that, based on anecdotal experiences of my personal interactions with WSU and GU students, it would be easier for me to stand out academically at WSU. Thoughts?\n\n4. Finances. I'm a non-traditional independent student with no income, who is returning to school due to being laid off. As mentioned previously, GU wasn't even under consideration due to cost until they offered me a grant which brought the total cost of attendance down to match that of WSU. Is this grant something I should look forward to for the next school year as well? I already expect to be 70k in the hole (30 from a prior experience, 40 for the next 2 years) from private student loans (amount does not include the stafford loans I'll be taking as well) at the end of my undergrad studies, and not having that grant next year would impose too much of a financial burden on me.",

I am under the impression that WSU isn't the same, would cost more for tutoring and wouldn't be of the same level of rigor. \n\nGrades: if you work hard you can get an a in every class. There are those kids. But they aren't the average kid. I would really doubt you would get into a t14 without doing some awesome extracurriculars. Gonzaga will help you do those while staying in school. For example, near mandatory community service tax prep. \n\nSocial: if you're going to college to party then it's clear where you should go. Gu is an entirely different social vibe, but my accounting friends still went \"hard\" on the weekends and made it by. Some of them are at the big four. The rest of the department is a pretty straight edge, casual party, go out once a week, etc. ",

The classes are hard, involved but the professors (in my experience) are downright amazing.  Like you mentioned at GU you will have to take more core classes, which at the time I found useless but really opened my eyes to a wider broad education on things I wouldn't have ever looked into.  I don't think your social life will suffer either way.  Most of my challenging course load came in my last 2 years. \n\nI chose Gonzaga because of the small and tight-knit atmosphere.  I loved the small campus.  I know it's not for everyone though.  I have several friends who went to WSU and enjoyed their time there.  You have many more options, everything is well....bigger, from the campus, to club options and classes.\n\nLooking back I would have made the same decision 10 out of 10 times.  Since I graduated they have made a ton of renovations, new buildings and the campus looks amazing.  (I was just there a few weeks ago)",

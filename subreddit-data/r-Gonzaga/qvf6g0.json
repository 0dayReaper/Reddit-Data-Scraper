    "postText": "Hi r/Gonzaga! We are Project RAD, a research study housed in the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington. The purpose of our study is to investigate how a variety of daily health behaviors and emotions impact relationship functioning among young adults. We are seeking individuals who live in Washington state to participate. Best of all? This research is all conducted online and you can earn $155 in Amazon e-gift cards for completing the full study.\n\nVisit our website to see if you\u2019re eligible:\u00a0[https://sites.uw.edu/projectrad/](https://sites.uw.edu/projectrad/)\n\nFirst, you will take our **anonymous** 5-minute screening survey to see if you may be a good fit for our study. If you are, you can decide at that time whether to give us your contact information or not. Participation will include one online survey (1 hour) in which you will be paid $30 to Amazon. The next portion includes completing 25 consecutive daily online surveys (5 mins each). You will be paid $4 to Amazon per daily survey and a bonus of $25 to Amazon for completing 22 out of 25 daily surveys. This amounts to a total of $155 to Amazon for completing all portions of our online study.\n\nOur study has been reviewed and approved by our University\u2019s Institutional Review Board. Participation is completely voluntary and you can remove yourself from the study at any time.\n\nPlease feel free to spread the word to fellow students and peers. Thanks!",

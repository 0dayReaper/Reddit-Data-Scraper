I haven't heard anything about KoC being torn down, but I assume it eventually will be as the new performing arts center is being built nearby. I was in the KoC hall last week and it has been emptied out. I believe it is going to be used for construction staging for the Myrtle Woldson building and then likely demolished for parking space. ",

    "postText": "My sister will be attending gonzaga in the fall.  Her birthday is coming up and me/my other siblings want to get her a couple gift cards that she can use at school.  What are some restaurants/coffee shops/stores/whatever else that students like to do? Preferably off campus because she will be on a meal plan and already owns a bunch of Zag apparel .  Please and thank you... \nalso Go Zags",

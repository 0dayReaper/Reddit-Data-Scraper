    "postText": "Hello, I am an incoming freshman and needing a laptop that will work with the engineering program. The problem I have is there are so many options I don't know which to choose. For those with experience, would you be able to recommend what would be the optimal choice? I don't have a desktop or anything like that so this would be my main computer for all my classes. Thanks!",

Very good for the technically-minded, as you can take it apart and upgrade it yourself.\n\n\n\nPlus, a bunch of other engineers will also have that laptop, so you can borrow their chargers if you need.",

For the love of god, don't get a surface book, mine crapped out after 2.5 years and no one I know who go one really likes it that much. Whatever you do end up getting, make sure you get plenty of ram (16gb minimum) and good integrated graphics. The model shouldn't matter to much as long as you have the right specs. Don't stress it though, I know structural people and mechanicals that made it through on Mac books",

It varies degree to degree, but Gonzaga as a whole has a fairly high job placement percentage.  I can't think of a single engineer in my (fairly recent) class who doesn't have a job.",

I think I got a fantastic education there, never ever felt like I was behind any co-workers. I graduated during the big economic downturn. Prior to that gonzaga all but guaranteed 100% employment placement for all the engineering programs. During 2009 it wasn't that good, but I believe they're close to it again. I had a job opportunity fall through 2 weeks before I graduated and had another job in two months, which was pretty good for 2009. I also had many friends get paid to get their master's at other engineering schools around the country.\n\nIf you like small classes and are ok not being on a research campus, gonzaga is an excellent choice.

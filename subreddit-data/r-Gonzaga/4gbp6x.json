Be sure to be open to change and feel out what you like. Put effort into your classes and you will be rewarded. ",

They offer a lot of support, and the opportunities you get leaving with an accounting degree from GU are incredible. If it's not your thing, don't do it, but don't dismiss it. Seriously look into it, give it a shot, and decide how you feel about it once you take those first classes ",

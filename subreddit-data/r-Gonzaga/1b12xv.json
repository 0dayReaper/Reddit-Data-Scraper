    "postText": "Gonzaga! \n\nMy name is... GarbageBuffalo for security reasons, and I recently moved to Spokane from Milwaukee after graduating from Marquette University (the shittier version of GU - Tough Luck Zags). \n\nIt is that time of the season when exams and other stresses can get in the way of things. That is why I am offering my services to the students. \n\nI can: clean, design things, fix things, edit/proofread, write, projects... you name it and I likely have experience in it. It never hurts to ask anyway.\n\nFor a reasonable price, I will do everything in my power to assist you in any way I can. It should be noted that I do not have a vehicle (I mentioned I graduated school too right?) and limited resources, but I have managed all the same. \n\nPlease pass me to friends or others who you think could use some help. PM me if you would like more info about me, contact info, or otherwise! \n\nThank you for your time. \nRespectfully, \nGarbageBuffalo  ",

    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman and had some questions about textbooks for certain classes. Any help would be appreciated. \n\n\n\nFor biology 105, the online book store says there is an option for a \"Mastering Biology with Pearson EText--standalone access card-- for biological science\" and also \"Biological science\" options with and without the mastering biology access code. Yet it says to pick one. So do I need both the books? I'm confused because they offer a la carte options for them too. I can include pictures if needed.\n\n\n\nSame sort of deal for Chem 101. There is the \"Chemistry: Structures and properties\" and the \"modified mastering chemisty w/e-text stand alone access card\" as well as some gu customers packages. Again it just says choose one. Does it not matter which one you get?\n\n\n\nLastly Comm100. I was price checking on amazon to save some money and the reviews said the book was pretty awful. Should I buy it? Is it necessary for the class? If I can save the money I'd really like to. \n\n\n\nThank you in advance for any help.",

                    "comment": "I was planning to use amazon when possible as it seems to be a far cheaper option for most of the texts, but I'm not sure if the access codes would still be valid on their rentals. Are the access codes necessary? Or just a convenience? As for instructors, for biology I have Haydock and Braley for lab. Chem says TBA for the instructors. Comm is Caputo. Thank you for the help!",

            "comment": "Welcome!\nHere are some tips on textbooks that I found helpful.\n\n1. Never be afraid to email your professor before class starts. That literally is the easiest way to get questions answered.  \n\n2. Look online at bigwords.com to see if there are cheaper editions. My current bill is 50 bucks for textbooks this semester. Bigwords is just a textbook search engine, so it scours the Internet for the cheapest version if what you are looking for. I personally would avoid online rentals as I have a tendency to not send the books back, but gonzaga rentals are great because the offices are RIGHT THERE.\n\nIt sounds like this might be a gonzaga only pack, so they might try to suck every penny out of you, but don't be afraid to see if there are used/ international editions of these.",

I assume they might not be valid if the books are rented out a lot. I'll find the answers I can on my own but I'll definitely consider contacting my professors if needed. Thanks again!",

One of the most memorable, for sure, but it doesn't beat out Laettner's shot to beat Kentucky. There was less time on the clock, and they were losing meaning if he missed the shot, the game was over. Suggs had an additional 1.2 seconds to work with, and no pressure to make it because the game was going to double OT if he missed it. The degree of difficulty was higher for Suggs, but that's only part of the equation.\n\nI'd also put Jenkins' shot in 2016 above this. It was a much easier look, but it was a literal **championship winning buzzer beater**. that's tough to beat",

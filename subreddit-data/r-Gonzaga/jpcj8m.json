I'm asking because maybe somebody knows exactly what he is looking for when he says \"be less vague\" because just generally adding more detail doesn't seem like enough.",

These teachers did hurt my GPA, however, it really did help me learn how to communicate with difficult people and work to be better in my course work. I would say that many of these teachers taught me the most overall because they really made me work to get the grade. Just trying to give you an  in hindsight view on this because I felt the same way in undergrad sometimes. If you think it is truly unfair, you can always go to the head of the department and talk to them about this. You don't need to have an amazing GPA to do well at college and beyond so I wouldn't worry about it too much.",

That said for me he wanted a citation for fucking everything.  If you think you have enough, you don't, add more.  The vast majority of what you write should be cited with only like a sentence or two per paragraph that is just your own thoughts/writing.  For reference, my worst graded essay in that class had 11 citations for 3 pages of writing, my best had 27 for 4 pages.",

From what I have gathered he prefers it if we use subject material covered in the lectures for a majority of the assignment.

The first draft helps you flesh out the ideas and the second draft is often more eloquent, concise, and flows better. It doesn't really count if you're referencing the first draft though because it's too easy to simply edit. The idea here is to start from scratch.",

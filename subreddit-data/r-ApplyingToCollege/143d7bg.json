    "postText": "The consensus on this sub is that essays are very very important for top schools - even more so than ECs sometimes - so I'm looking for any examples of essays that are good enough to actually make a difference in a decision. Basically essays that would potentially get your regular 3.7 1400 kid with a few clubs, cashier job and JV soccer into an Ivy. Maybe this is just my personal opinion (and I am by no means claiming to be a better writer) but the \"great\" essays I've seen - letter S, costco, most of the college essay guy examples - either seem too contrived or have beautiful prose but little substance. The best one i've seen that was both well-written and had depth was Cassandra Hsiao's essay but other than that i haven't seen a great number of essays that made me go wow. Any links to examples are greatly appreciated!",

Luckily, I was able to recover in the health center building that my parents donated to your school last year. My mom took a few days off from her duties as your CS department chair to read me stories every day. And as the chair of your board of trustees, my dad was able to call an emergency meeting to mandate the school band serenade me every Tuesday. Thanks to my drive for success and grit, I overcame these challenges and won the game.",

            "comment": "The Harvard admissions lawsuit information strongly suggested two relevant things.\n\nFirst, almost no one got a personal 1 on their 6 point scale.  Like, a handful of applicants a year.  And even among them, like 1/3rd still got rejected!\n\nSecond, this means if you were unhooked, you really needed a 2 on academics AND also an activities (ECs and unrecruited athletics) 2 AND also a personal 2 to get admitted.  This is why the personal stuff is so important, but it doesn't mean the academics and activities stuff is unimportant.  It more means if you meet Harvard's high standards in those areas, they still want you to meet their high personal standards too.  But if you are unhooked and didn't meet their high standards in any one of these areas, you were extremely unlikely to be able to make it up in another area.  Even with a personal 1--presumably most of the people who got personal 1s and still got rejected simply did not get 2/2 in academic/activities, and their 1/3/3 (or whatever) didn't get them in.\n\nOK, so what should you be thinking about essays?  Well, Harvard graded almost everyone (99%+ of applicants) a personal 3 (\"generally positive\"), or personal 2 (\"very strong\").  Among otherwise competitive unhooked applicants, it looks like around 75% got a 3 and were very unlikely to get admitted, and around 25% got a 2 and were very likely to get admitted.\n\nSo what sort of essay would support a 2 personal score?  I think you should understand it doesn't have to be genius, it just has to be like a top 25% essay among otherwise competitive unhooked applicants.  That alone is quite the achievement, of course, because unhooked competitive applicants to schools like Harvard are excellent students, AND also things like student body presidents, debate team captains, highly competitive albeit unrecruited varsity athletes, and so on.  So submitting a better essay than 3 out of 4 such people is not easy.\n\nStill, it isn't superhuman either.  It is just \"very strong\".  And that pretty much explains what you are seeing.\n\nAs for personal 1 essays--those are not 1 out of 4, those are more like 1 out of 3000.  And to be blunt, unless you truly have an amazing personal story, I don't like your chances of beating those odds just by imitating the better essays you find online.",

She was top 10% of her class with a national spike sports EC (top 50 in her individual sport and competing in national tournaments for 8+ years) plus a lot of good regular ECs with leadership (editor in chief of school newspaper, peer tutor, etc.). Did not apply as a recruited athlete, but she could have (D3 and lower D1). T50 was a mix waitlists and acceptances. T20 was mostly rejections with a few acceptances and waitlists.\n\nSimilar experience with her classmates and family friends. A kid we know in CS was lucky to crack the T20 with one admission while having stellar numbers, powerhouse high school, but generic ECs.\n\nI don't know what year you are in school, but the process is much much more competitive than people think. Kids with good grades and generic profile are a dime a dozen.",

(I don't want to use one of my free clicks to link it lol) I liked it so much I used it as a \"teaching example\" in a YouTube video (my main focus is writing books, but I've done a few college related videos as well). \n\nOne of the best college admissions essays I ever read isn't available publicly, and I can't even share much, re: content because it was deeply personal. But I read Amanda Gorman's college admissions essay and it made me cry. (she was a mentee in the organization I volunteer with) It had a very specific metaphor and talked both about writing and personal stuff/growth. I had zero notes. She was (and is, obviously) truly special.\n\nIt's very very very rare for a college essay to be \"God tier,\" so take that pressure off... I agree a lot of the lauded ones I find rather contrived. Then again, sometimes admissions officers love contrived! I attended an info session for my alma matter years ago as an alumni volunteer and the admissions director read part of an essay she loved and, man, I thought it was soooooo basic. So mileage varies. Best practice is to write something genuine and specific, imo. Don't over-write. Watch for humblebrags (I've read some truly cringy ones that do this).",

They do not \"compensate\" for one another since they indicate different aspects of who you are.\n\nYour grades and SAT are very low for Ivy League schools. This cannot be \"overcome\" by a personal essay, that is a space for you to talk about who you are as a PERSON, not to demonstrate academic aptitude.\n\nSimilarly, poor ECs cannot be compensated with good grades or a good personal statements. Neither of the latter two things can demonstrate leadership, civil service, personal achievement, which is why you are supposed to engage in ECs.",

One or two Bs is fine, especially if freshman year, a few A minuses are fine as well, but ideally top schools don't want to see anything below a solid A. I remember seeing a video of a girl who got into Dartmouth going over her admissions file and she said that the AOs had circled the one A- and one B+ she had gotten.",

            "comment": "The summer before junior year, I basically didn\u2019t do anything. This is because I didn\u2019t know anything about the college application process till much later. However, since it is a bit late to apply to actual summer programs, I would recommend maybe getting a job, doing volunteering at a place you enjoy, or cold-emailing some professors for research. If you\u2019d like, u can also try out a course at ur local community college, if u think ur prepared enough. U still have all of junior year to get some good opportunities to improve ur extracurriculars, so please don\u2019t stress!!",

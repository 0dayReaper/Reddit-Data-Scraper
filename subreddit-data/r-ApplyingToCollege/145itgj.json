    "postText": "Prompt: Why do you want to study your chosen major specifically at Georgia Tech?  \n\n\nIs this asking \u201cWhy this major?\u201d or \u201cWhy Georgia Tech?\u201d?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide note: I emailed GaTech admissions and they basically gave me a GIGANTIC email about random shit that had 0 relevance to my question.\n\nEmail they sent back:\n\nHi u/cirrus10M,\n\nThank you for your message. Your paraphrase of the essay question \\[in my email I asked a question, I didn't \u201cparaphrase\u201d anything\\] is a great way to answer the essay prompt. We use a holistic review in order to give our applicants the best opportunity to present a complete picture of their qualifications.  \nGeorgia Tech uses the Common Application for first-year applications. Students are required to submit the application, accompanying essay and short answer questions, and the non-refundable application fee by the application deadline. Additional materials such as test scores, transcripts, and letters of recommendation may be submitted after the application deadline up until the document deadline. Our website has more information on all of our first-year dates and deadlines.  \nFirst-year applicants are required to submit at least one SAT or one ACT. We accept more than one score and will use your highest individual section scores across multiple testing dates in the evaluation process. While we do not have a minimum required score, we encourage applicants to aim for the scores near the Mid 50% ranges listed on our class profile. Applicants can either self-report their scores on the application prior to submission or send official score reports from the testing company. Other methods won\u2019t be accepted.  \nFirst-year applicants must submit their high school transcripts, including all coursework taken in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and if available, 12th grades. We encourage applicants to take the most rigorous course available to them at their high school. We do not have a preference between AP, IB, Dual Enrollment or other rigorous curriculums.  \nTranscripts mailed to us must be sealed official copies. PDF documents emailed to us will not be accepted. For additional information, please visit our document submission web-page.  \nLetters of recommendation are not required, but we will accept a maximum to two. Letters of recommendation must come from your high school counselor and a high school teacher. Additional recommendations or recommendations from persons who are not the student\u2019s high school counselor or teacher will not be considered.  \nFor a complete overview of Georgia Tech\u2019s first-year admission requirements and to begin your application, please visit our admission website.  \nBest Wishes and Go Jackets.,  \nChristina Scott (Her/Hers/She)  \nOffice of Undergraduate Admission  \nGeorgia Institute of Technology  \nWebsite: admission.gatech.edu  \nEmail: admission@gatech.edu  \nPhone: (404)-894-4154",

            "comment": "The prompt speaks for itself: they want you to tie your interest in the major to specific resources at GeorgiaTech: classes unique to the university, faculty conducting research that you\u2019re interested in, departmental collections/archives etc.\n\nThey also want to see if you\u2019ve actually taken the time to research the school, understand how its resources relate to your major, and are pursuing admission for reasons beyond prestige, ranking, and low-effort clich\u00e9s like its \u201cworld-renowned faculty\u201d and \u201camazing education.\u201d \n\nBe specific.",

Learn some things about what makes the school unique and BE SPECIFIC. Avoid generalities and empty superlatives, as noted above. Learn about the way your chosen major is taught at GT and be able to articulate why that matters to you.",

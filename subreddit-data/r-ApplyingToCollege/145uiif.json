    "postText": "I'm an international student, and there are two things that keep my GPA low. The first one is that I go to a school that specializes in math and physics. The acceptance rate of the school is very low, and in order to get in, you need to pass a very difficult exam. So what happens is that students who are in this school were all getting perfect math grades in their previous schools. In order to avoid having everyone getting perfect grades, my school makes the tests much harder than in an average school to differentiate the students' performance. Therefore, if I get a math grade of 7/10, it means that I'm performing among those who used to get 10/10 in an average school. It's like arguably considered the best school of entire Armenia. Almost all students who are chosen to represent the country in the international olympiads are from my school.  \nThe second problem is that almost all teachers never grade a 10, even if you get everything right. The maximum grade is typically 9/10 for most subjects. Additionally, we have four different math subjects, and on average, the grades are around 7/10. This brings my GPA to around 3.4/4. However, I am aiming for top universities such as MIT. Interestingly, I achieved a perfect 800 on the SAT Math in just 9th grade on my first attempt. So, it's quite amusing that my math grade is 7/10 (2.8/4).  \nWhat concerns me is that for a place like MIT, even if I explain the situation and submit a decent application, a 3.4 GPA may be considered a straightforward rejection. They might not fully grasp how difficult our tests actually are and assume that if I can't achieve higher than a 3.4 in my school, then I won't be able to succeed at MIT. I am also planning to take AP courses, but I don't believe they will factor into my school GPA. Therefore, I'm wondering if there is something I can do to entirely compensate for it. I fear that they might not even believe that the tests at my school are as challenging as I describe them.  \n",

    "postText": "So it\u2019s summer and I\u2019m going into my junior year, which means it\u2019s that time to impress colleges. I live in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota and I\u2019m trying to find summer activities that look good for college. The problem is that I\u2019m not sure what opportunities or activities are out there for someone who\u2019s interested in government and politics, and many of the programs that universities offer are already closed. I\u2019m also Chinese citizen and not a US citizen, which makes opportunities to work with the federal government difficult to impossible. So I suppose that I\u2019m looking for advice on a passion project.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m thinking about reading books political topics, doing street interviews with people in the city on their opinion on certain issues, and perhaps take an online college level course that\u2019s higher than AP on the topic.\n\nI\u2019m aiming to go to the top schools, so I\u2019m wondering whether these are good ideas for summer activities that would impress those colleges. If there are any other ideas, I would greatly appreciate it!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not doing these activities solely for colleges. I really am interested in government and politics, but just have issues and trouble finding a passion project or activities to do during the summer with all the time I have.",

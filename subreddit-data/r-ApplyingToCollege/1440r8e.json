    "postText": "hello this is coming from an average person with a very uneventful life. i have absolutely no idea what to write for my college essays. everyone says to go about the formulaic route (which at this point there is no right one) but i don\u2019t even have anything meaningful or life changing to write about. i can\u2019t even make mundane things seem interesting. i know this makes me seem like a boring person and while that may be true i have had some struggles, but none that i can manage to write a whole essay about. even the few things i have experienced seem like common experiences. nothing makes me stand out, i\u2019m not even particularly clear what my personality is let alone be able to show it through writing. so please, any advice that could help would really be appreciated.",

How have you dealt with that fear and/or anxiety?\n3. What something you've done (in or out of school) that you found meaningful?  Don't limit yourself; this could be something as simple as \"mowing my grandma's lawn\".\n4. What are your hopes and dreams, in general, aside from college and career?  What sort of person do you want to be, and what are you doing to become that person?",

            "comment": "i understand the struggle :,) it is very difficult to write an essay that is ultimately going to showcase the bulk of your character. here\u2019s something to think about tho: your experiences do not have to be \u201cunique\u201d. what matters most is what you took away from said experience and how it has impacted you as a person. the takeaway is what ultimately makes you stand out.\n\nthis kind of goes the same with writing about any struggles you have. first off: make sure you\u2019re comfortable talking about it first. then again, just think about what you have learned or are currently learning from that struggle, how you\u2019ve dealt with it, and how it had impacted you as a person. \n\nit\u2019s easy to fall into just simply saying \u201coh, this experience made me stronger\u201d or \u201cthis made me rethink the value of _____\u201d. there\u2019s no harm in saying those things, but you need to be SPECIFIC. how does it apply to you and only you? you can make the general statement, but elaborating on specifics is what may give your essay that \u201cunique\u201d aspect you\u2019re looking for.\n\ni hope this helps :)) good luck!\n\ntldr: it\u2019s okay to have \u201cgeneral experiences\u201d. what you took away from it and how it has impacted you is what makes that experience unique.",

It could be about a book you read, an item that\u2019s important to you, or a routine you have. What matters is that you pick something that\u2019s meaningful to you and write about it in an interesting way.",

    "postText": "During my sophomore year I participated in National Honors Society, Varsity Orchestra, JROTC, ACADeca, UIL Academics (Science and all of Math), French Club, and Chess Club.\n\nRemarkable achievement:\nI have competed VEX Robotics World Competition my freshman year as Captain of our Females Team\n\nNext year I am about to be a Junior, and unfortunately\nIt is going to be my last year being in JROTC, because I will have it as ROTC 4 (H)\n(I plan on being top 3% of my class)\n\nFurthermore, I stopped being captain of our females team my sophomore year because our team stopped caring about going to Nationals and overall focused on other things.\n\nSo, I am not sure what to do with these two dilemmas for college applications. What should I do my Junior year to make up for it? \n\n\nPS: My goal/dream is to get accepted into Rice.\nI know it is a bit unrealistic, especially since I am a hispanic minority, but I think it is worth giving it a shot. Also, if anyone here has gotten into Rice, please contact me since I need someone to mentor me/give me advice on how to get there.",

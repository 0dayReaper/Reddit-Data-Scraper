    "postText": "So I'm a 25[mtF] who graduated High School in 2014. I decided to take some time off, because I was sorta burnt out. Planned to go back later, but just never did. \n\nFlash forward almost a decade, and I'm trying to enroll in College. I tried to just go on with doing it online, but a lot of stuff came up that I have no clue whatsoever about. \n\nOne of the questions asked me about a Counselor recommendation and told me it was required for where I was applying (RIC), but I do not remember my counselor's name, nor am I aware if she's even still at the school I graduated from.\n\nIt asked me for class statistics that I had no knowledge of. \n\nWhile a cover letter isn't required, should I submit one anyway? \n\nI also took the SAT, but that's been 10 years,\nand I don't recall my score   \n\nI honestly feel like I'm stranded in the deep end with no clue as to what I'm doing \n\nCan anyone help me sort any of this out, or have any advice for enrolling somewhere after 10 years off?",

Do well in those classes and you\u2019ll be able to show a 4-year school you\u2019re capable of succeeding. Then write an honest essay explaining why you took your academic break and how you\u2019ve matured as a person and now feel like you\u2019re ready to give your education your full attention and best effort.\n\nETA: I went back to school as a 25-year old sophomore and ended up being stuck with an 18-year old freshman roommate (freshman dorms were full so they stuck him with me). Do your best to avoid that kind of a situation at all costs. 18-year olds are horrible.",

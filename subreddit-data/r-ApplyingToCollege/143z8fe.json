My intended major (astronomy/ astrophysics) doesn't really have much available EC opportunities for high schoolers so its kinda the best I got. I mostly just do it for fun and I feel cool and science-y but I'm not sure if I could include it, thats fine if not. If you have any ideas for astronomy EC lmk, so far I know about astronomy clubs but haven't gotten much further than that.",

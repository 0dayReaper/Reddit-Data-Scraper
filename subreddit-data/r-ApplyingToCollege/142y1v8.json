    "postText": "Hi! Im a rising senior still figuring out my college list. I have plenty of reaches I love, but am definitely lacking in safety-match schools.\n\nI kind of overlooked LACs at first but I recently noticed Macalester which I kind of like and am going to tour. Looking for similar-ish schools, midwest is nice but anything not in the south works. Really the only must-have is a good comp sci program. On my (very rough) current list are: uchicago, notre dame, brown, princeton, boston university, minnesota twin cities, and madison. I\u2019m well aware I have too many reaches and not enough saftey and matches(and tbh I dont love the last 2 at all), so I\u2019m hoping for recs that I have a good chance of getting into. \n\nOkay anyway I don\u2019t think you need my full personal history but I have a 3.98/4.27 UW/W, 35 ACT, 10 APs including sr year, leadership in an honor society, founded a club, 4 years of a sport. \n\nThanks!",

It\u2019s got great STEM offerings and a lot of STEM majors, is in the Midwest, and has a \u201cvibe\u201d very similar to Chicago (academia/PhD heavy). My list looked a lot like yours when I started and I\u2019m heading Carleton this fall\n\n(If you\u2019re a woman, I\u2019d also say to check out Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Smith, etc\u2026)",

Pomona, Harvey Mudd, Swarthmore, Grinnell, and Haverford are some other reaches I would look at.\n\nSt. Olaf is a good one in that target range - right across town from Carleton so easy to visit both in one shot if you are interested.\n\nDepending on what you like about LACs, you might also want to look at small to mid size engineering schools.  They usually have the same undergrad focus at least and almost all of them will have pretty good CS programs - Rose Hulman, Colorado School of Mines, and WPI are a few good examples.",

I definitely think you should apply, and I think (again, please take this with a grain of salt) you'd probably get in! When I applied there was one supplemental and you had the option to choose between 3 different questions, which made the process easier\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think you're setting yourself up for heartbreak! Your list seems pretty balanced so far",

They have a beautiful campus, my tour guide was wonderful, and the school spirit seemed great. The location is great, not too rural but not too urban either. My mom described it as a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d liberal arts college, but I really felt like I could fit in there. Hope that helps you at all!\n\nEdit: btw, no idea about their CS program, sorry! I\u2019m sure it would be easy to figure out online though. They specialize in engineering so they should be good in STEM at least.",

    "postText": "For the past 2 years my parents enrolled me into this college consulting \"bootcamp\" called something to the effect of \"Julie Kim Consulting.\" They want me to go to a really nice college, and I appreciate that they're doing their best to help me, but I'm not sure how much credibility Julie Kim has. From the very start I felt kinda weird about the entire thing- it felt disingenuous? I don't know how to tell them it isn't really helping, and that I might need to use a different approach.  I'm going into my junior year, and am also starting to do SAT prep with yet another service my parents are paying for called Chariot Learning (SAT tutoring). I'm trying to follow all of the Julie Kim advice on passion projects but currently I'm not very satisfied with my passion project, and it just feels like her guidelines are restricting my creative freedom- I do understand that it has to have some degree of professionalism I guess, but I still feel weird about it. There are just so many things I want to do for the sake of doing, which isn't cutting it- I also contacted some professors for potential research opportunities but have been very lazy about it. Overall I've just been so lazy- I can't just blame a college consulting service if I don't get into a good college bc I haven't been putting all the work in anyways- it feels like I'm just not motivated enough to get into a good college, and once again have to have someone force me to work in order to accomplish anything. I have no idea what I'm doing, meanwhile my parents are spending thousands of dollars on things I'm too lazy to use. I've never had leadership positions in anything, I've never done that many extracurriculars, never done any sports, never had a job, and I feel like I'm running out of time to do all these things just so I can go to a good college and prove I'm actually good at something. I feel like I fundamentally have the wrong mindset and just don't have the work ethic to apply to a good college, let alone be a functioning adult. I just hope I don't become a failure",

            "comment": "It sounds extremely formulaic.  Do passion project, do internship, do research, start non-profit, get leader position in X/Y/Z clubs =&gt; Ivy League Acceptance.\n\nI suspect that formula is less effective than people make it out to be.\n\nWhether you want to fight your parents about the boot camp is up to you.  If you don't think it's helping then feel free to ignore the advice, unless that will also get you in hot water with your parents.\n\nTwo things I'd advise you to keep in mind:\n\n1. You might follow THE JULIE KIM PLAN (TM) to the letter and still not get into the schools you want to get into.  There are no guarantees.  Ergo if you aren't admitted to the schools you want to get into, that doesn't necessarily mean you \"should have done more\".\n2. Getting into top-whatever doesn't make you a success; not getting into top-whatever doesn't make you a failure.  Undergraduate school != destiny.",

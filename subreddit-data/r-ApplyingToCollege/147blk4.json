    "postText": "I've heard a lot of things about indicating majors when first applying. Namely, I've heard that most colleges don't consider the major you've indicated as long as it stays within the same college (i.e. staying within CAS). But, I've also heard that even tho colleges don't \"consider\" your major, they still got a quota to fill for each major. \n\nSo if the first statement that colleges don't consider major is true, why even bother indicating a major at all?",

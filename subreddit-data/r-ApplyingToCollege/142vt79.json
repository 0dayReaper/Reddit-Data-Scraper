Does this also apply to your GPA (I.e. there isnt much of a difference between a 3.9 vs 3.95 or a 4.4 vs. 4.5)?\n\nThanks",

Of course for other colleges the threshold is a 1200 or a 1300 but the point I was trying to make was that a 1550+ is good enough for all colleges out there. Sorry I didn\u2019t clarify that before",

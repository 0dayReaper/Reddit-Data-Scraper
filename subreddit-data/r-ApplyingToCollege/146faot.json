And then during the school year create a club at school and ask for others to join in. You can also look into some programs which are available online and are rolling admissions meaning like accept people throughout the year. See if you can join organizations related to your major and do some impactful work through it. Don't lose hope and continue with that and your SAT or ACT.",

However, a decent chunk of this same admission data is also located at [https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/), as of today. It is posted in June each year.\n\nCommon Data Set 2023-2024, with admission data pertaining to this fall's freshmen (high school class of 2023), will begin to be posted on most college websites in winter and spring of 2024. It will show up on the above college navigator website in June 2024.",

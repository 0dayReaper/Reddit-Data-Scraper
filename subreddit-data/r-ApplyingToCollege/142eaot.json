He talked about how it was where he first heard about the Trayvon Martin shooting and the first place he thought to go when he was stopped by the cops for biking in our neighborhood. He also talked about how it was a place he could experiment with different hairstyles, how it helped our bond as father and son with me learning how to care for his hair, and how they talked about mundane things like music and sports. I thought it was well done and he got into almost all of the schools he applied to but we have since wondered if that was the best direction to go in. It's over now and doesn't really matter.

Does that applicant's essay touch on racism? Yes, absolutely: as part of his experience. Was it *about* racism? No. \n\nIn the essays I've seen that deal with race as it relates to identity, Black applicants usually discuss navigating white-dominated spaces (private schools, certain sports) or, more specifically, the challenges they have with (or the encounters that stem from the fascination that people have with) their hair. The former often end up as standard \"fish out of water\" narratives that require some unpacking. The latter essays tend to veer off into larger discussions of American cultural ideals of beauty and often have to be reined in to focus on personal aspects. \n\nStudents tend to approach this subreddit with essay topics that are more conceptual than personal. The first task is to get them to find what's personal in the concept: what's *specific* to them, what's *uniquely* them. If an applicant can't get past wanting to broadly write about \"how music inspires me,\" or \"how I accepted my racial identity,\" then my auto-reply is \"find another topic.\" It's not that those are inherently bad topics, it's that I know they desperately want to write what they think AOs want to read, and there are only so many ways that I can say \"that's not a personal essay, dig deeper.\" \n\nAs with any essays, if the writer isn't willing to reflect on their experiences (and what they've internalized), then they can come across as trite and clich\u00e9d. More generally, if the [writing is bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/140ejp1/comment/jmwp56i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), then it doesn't matter what an applicant is writing about. That, however, is a matter of practice and rewriting.\n\nAs sci-fi writer Ted Chiang recently wrote in a [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web) piece on ChatGPT, \u201cYour first draft isn\u2019t an unoriginal idea expressed clearly; it\u2019s an original idea expressed poorly, and it is accompanied by your amorphous dissatisfaction, your awareness of the distance between what it says and what you want it to say.\"",

            "comment": "Drake has truly changed my whole entire life. I was first a clueless, senseless individual, until I discovered Aubrey Drake Graham. He took me under his wing and guided me through his delightful path. I have since then changed into a charming handsome man. I wish all other non-Drake listeners will at last find this path as it will lead to the whole world being in harmony and peace at last. No single individual outshining others such as Aubrey Drake Graham has been graced to us since the beginning of time. The moment he graced us with his groundbreaking performance as Jimmy Brooks in Degrassi: The Next Generation at only the age of 14 years old, the sun rose differently. Beauty and balance in the world was restored, and the new golden age of humanity dawned for the first time. When miracles like Falling Back touch down to our planet, the clouds clear and the birds start chirping. I wouldn't be so surprised if Drake is the reason we are able to breathe, eat, and hear everyday. When Drake is played upon the ears of one, they come at peace, being able to outmaneuver and look down on others. If one is not fond of Drake, you can take an observation out of the others, they are sad, unjoyful, and melancholy. They do not understand that would take a bullet for us, just as we would for him. It is truly enraging today that these who disrespect Drake are continuously allowed to withhold opinions today. But in the end, thank you Drake for your wonderful blessing you decide to share Honestly, Nevermind with us on June 17, 2022 at exactly 12:02 AM EST. It will be celebrated from today, everyday forward, and go down in history as the best album ever released. I am very happy I was able to hear this masterpiece before it is recognized as the crescendo of music itself. As for all others reading this too, thank you Aubrey Drake Graham\ud83d\udc10, we love you.",

If you are applying as a music major, an essay that talks about music (maybe tied to religion or Drake as sources of inspiration if that reveals something interesting about you) would make sense. The teeth essay might work for dental school but won\u2019t you be applying for a different major? If it\u2019s, say, bio, you might use that theme to talk about your long term aspirations - what you have done to prepare for college, why college will help you become a dentist, how you\u2019ll help contribute to the community on campus and afterwards. You might want that essay to tie together your aspirations with your extracurricular activities - if you are in orchestras and applying as a music major 5 makes more sense in some ways. Seems like you are focusing on influences in your life but this is also a sales pitch where you explain why they should want you on their campus and what you\u2019ll bring to the community that\u2019s special",

I\u2019ve told my child the following:\n\n1. Don\u2019t write about sports or music. She is an athlete and musician, so she hated this advice. Reason for this: sports and music are the 2 most common topics by a wide margin. Sure, you *could* write a unique and amazing essay. But every student thinks they have a unique \u201ctwist.\u201d Remember that the AO has likely read hundreds and hundreds of essays about sports and music (this includes famous musicians). They may have read dozens right before yours. It\u2019s a huge task to write something that will stand out in any way.\n\n2. Don\u2019t write about career goals because many colleges have a supplemental essay about what you want to study there. Will likely be duplicative.\n\n3. Same goes for diversity type essays. Lots of supplementals ask about how you will contribute to their diverse community.\n\nSo of your options, maybe the uncle/expectations one is the best? At a minimum, review the supplementals your colleges had last year to make sure what you\u2019re writing won\u2019t cover the same topics.",

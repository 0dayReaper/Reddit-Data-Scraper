Will welcome any suggestions as long as they fit what I'm looking for!! Doesn't matter if it would be a reach, target, etc. which is why I didn't include my stats\n\nSchools on my list so far: Northwestern, University of Rochester, University of Maryland college park, University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, Illinois Wesleyan, Syracuse, Ithaca\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n\\- LGBT friendly, specifically transgender friendly (gender neutral restrooms and housing options, student groups, etc.). Would be great if there are HRT resources on campus/near campus but not required!!\n\n\\- In an LGBT friendly state or at the very least doesn't discriminate against LGBT educators and/or doesn't ban legal adults from accessing HRT\n\n\\- Located in an LGBT friendly city/area\n\n\\- Offers bachelors degree in Music Education, preferably has the option to have a specific emphasis (such as choral or instrumental)\n\n\\- At least 5% Asian population (would be great if it's around 10%)\n\n\\- Has an Asian student group\n\n\\- Asian American friendly city/area/state\n\n\\- Preferably not in a state that's too much to the west or too much to the north. The farthest west I can go is probably Colorado and the furthest North would be New York but that's a stretch, Pennsylvania's more of the true limit (my parents don't want me to move far away from home)\n\nI'm grateful for any and all suggestions!",

Epecially if your primary instrument is popular.  This is an important designation because a lot of schools do not have a music ed program.  \n\nAlso, have you run net price calculators for all these options?  Like unless you qualify for a lot of FA, a lot of these are going to be very expensive options unless you are in state for one of the publics on this list.  Maryland and UIUC are also very competitive music programs.\n\nYou should know the music ed program affiliated with URochester is offered through Eastman School of Music.  Extrememly competitive conservatory program.\n\nSchools you may want to consider that may be generous with merit and have high quality music ed programs - Lawrence University (WI), Saint Olaf College (MN), DePaul University SOM (IL), Baldwin Wallace (OH).  Consider your own state's flagship.  I would consider all these options LGBTQIA friendly.\n\nI know a lot about music admission.  You are welcome to message me if you want.",

I'm auditioning on a popular instrument so I'm aware of the competition, the only schools I'm truly confident having a successful audition with are my state schools (but sadly my state is anything but LGBT friendly)\n\nI'll message you a few questions I have about the process of music admission",

You'd have to obviously crosscheck the schools with your other requirements, but this might give you some insight into how LGBT-friendly and -committed schools are (as a lot of them can claim that friendliness and commitment but it isn't always quite as strong in reality as they claim).",

They just straight up don't have an UG music ed track.\n\nI actually have a kid that applied there for music.   He met with a teacher there who said directly he'd love to work with him, but he'd get much better financial offers elsewhere and UG performance opportunities were quite limited for what he was applying for.  \n\nThat said, if your finances get you a lot of aid and you get in there and click with a music teacher, great.  I'm sure you can have an xcellent experience and it depends on instrument/track.  They have a lot of great faculty.  Their music building is lovely.  It just seemed more of a grad school oriented program.  You really have to get in and visit because plenty of schools that have grad programs will still be really great for UG.  Both my music kids attend a program that had grad students.\n\nCMU was one of the schools where we looked where a lot of the senior recitals we found on youtube were ok but not amazing.  Just because a lot of people apply doesn't make it the best.  For music and performance, urban schools just tend to be super popular regardless.   And some apply wanting to double degree to a school like CMU (which a lot of music teachers have mixed feelings about)",

The only problem might be location and the lack of a campus (in NYU's case). There are also plenty of art and music schools (SVA, Pratt, Julliard) if that's more of what you're looking for. If you need more affordable options, check out the SUNY/CUNY schools that have music majors.",

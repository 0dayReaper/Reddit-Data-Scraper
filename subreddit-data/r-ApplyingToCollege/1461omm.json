    "postText": "So basically I had to help my parents with their restaurant starting 6th grade(child labor go brrr) We don\u2019t make a lot of money and couldn\u2019t hire much workers so it was basically just me, my brother, my mom, and my dad working. Of course because of this I couldn\u2019t do any extracurriculars with all the transportation issues and stuff. But recently, during the second half of sophomore year, business died down and I was able to start doing extracurriculars like sports since my parents started having more time. But because I had to work I couldn\u2019t start them earlier and probably won\u2019t get any leadership positions. Am I doomed for Ivies? I have perfects grades and am ranked 1 in my school with the hardest course load ever seen from my school (my school is very uncompetitive and lacking resources tho).",

            "comment": "I think this can put you in a special category, which is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nFor example, in the Harvard admissions lawsuit, it came out they instructed reviewers to identify applicants where there was \"\\[s\\]ubstantial activity outside of conventional EC participation such as family commitments or term-time work\"/\"\\[f\\]amily responsibilities at home or very limited resources that make it unlikely that the applicant could participate in extracurricular or other activities.\"  They noted this sort of circumstance could be included by reviewers along with other ECs to justify a higher rating for those ECs, or they could be a substitute for ECs entirely in appropriate circumstances.\n\nIt sounds like you are going to be looking for the former sort of treatment (essentially asking reviewers to boost your EC evaluation in the context of these family/work commitments), and I suspect Harvard is not at all alone in telling its reviewers that is a viable path to a high overall score.\n\nBut as usual, you will probably want to do all this with a tone that is overall positive, meaning while at the same time you are implicitly asking for such special consideration, you should still be explicitly talking about how meaningful it was to you to work in the family restaurant, how you were glad you could at least be more active at school recently, and so on.",

Like my school doesn\u2019t really offer any clubs or competitions clubs like DECA because there aren\u2019t any competitions nearby and because the school is very under resourced. Because of this I don\u2019t really have opportunities that kids from schools outside of my district have.",

    "postText": "For context, I am a junior in high school taking dual enrollment classes at my local community college. Currently, I am taking Calculus II and my final is coming up. I need a high 80 to maintain my A, but I'm not sure if I can achieve that. My dilemma is that if I do get a B in the class, should I request it to be reflected as a pass, rather than take the B?\n\nDual classes are included on my high school transcript, so I don't want a B to negatively affect my GPA. Technically it would be my only B on my transcript, but I have taken unweighted classes that are already bringing my GPA down and it's quite an important course, so any insight would be appreciated!",

Obviously if you can get an A that's the best outcome, but a B in Calculus II is not going to break you and will be better than getting a Pass which could also be viewed as a likely C.",

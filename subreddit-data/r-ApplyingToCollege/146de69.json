    "postText": "I am a junior who hasn\u2019t applied to any colleges yet, but probably will soon. I recently got a letter from Harvard asking me to apply even tho I only did average on the PSAT (I did do pretty good on the ACT but I don\u2019t know if they look at that and they claim not to care about standardized tests). This made me start wondering if it was due to legacy and how exactly it works.\n\nMy main questions are as follows:\n\n1) How much of an impact does legacy make?\n\n2) How do you measure how much legacy you have? I understand that it\u2019s better if you have it from your parents, but does generation factor in? (In my situation my aunt, uncle, and grand-father when to Harvard, but my dad didn\u2019t, but he did go to another college that I was considering.)\n\n3) Do the actions of the family member who is the legacy matter? (If a family member went to Harvard and did something notably good, would that help, and would the inverse hurt?)\n\n4) Should I feel bad for exploiting my legacy? (I do think that it\u2019s a pretty unfair way of determining who gets in, and would feel bad taking someone\u2019s spot if they deserved it more than me, but I also understand that if I am in a position of privilege I shouldn\u2019t waste it.)",

The admissions office does this based on their institutional goals and internal procedures.  If you want a proxy for it, colleges that have a higher focus on legacy (e.g. high % of student body who are legacy, high importance on Common Data Set, etc) will be places where it can matter more.  If your parents have been on various boards, donated a lot, and been engaged as alumni (or are very famous/wealthy/powerful people), that's generally better than if they just got their degrees and peaced out into the sunset, never to be heard from again.  If your profile is very strong anyway, legacy might be the tipping point for you.\n\n3.  They can.  Depends on what it is.\n\n4.  No, IMO.  That's the college's prerogative, not yours.  You should try to make the most of the lot you've been given regardless of who your parents are.  If you aren't strong enough as a candidate, then in the vast majority of cases, you won't get in regardless of legacy status.",

Acceptance rate for legacy students are generally 2-4 times higher than non-legacy students at top private universities. Legacy status does not matter to Public Institution because they are meant to give everyone a fair chance for college admission regardless of their backgrounds.\n\n2. Many universities would consider those with alumni parents (primary legacy) to be more important, they have higher acceptance rate than those who are secondary legacy (alumni relative). \n\n3. Controversial opinion: yes, I\u2019d argue that donation matters a lot to private institution. Money matters a lot to them and they generally don\u2019t want to state this explicitly (because they don\u2019t want to stir controversies) but it\u2019s the reality.\n\n4. Depends. Many people act in their self-interest, and sometimes fairness is not their priority. I would feel bad \u201cif\u201d I am under-qualified but got in with because I am a legacy student. But sometimes legacy students are just as qualified as other non-legacy students. This can be the same for Black/Hispanic/American Indian applicants who are benefitted from affirmative action.

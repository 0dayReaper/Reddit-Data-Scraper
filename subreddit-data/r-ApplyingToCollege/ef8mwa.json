She applied to over 20 schools, most of which are T20. She can probably get into any of them and afford it.\n\nBased on conversations I have had with her (and conversations she\u2019s had with others that I have heard about), she plans on going to our city college that is barely T200. Why? While besides it being academically easy, her boyfriend goes there. A brilliant girl is making one of the most important decisions of her life based on this boyfriend\n\nUpdate: The girl wants to be a doctor and plans to get her bachelors and MD at the same university. She\u2019s gone to many summer programs at colleges 12+ hours away so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s staying at home. The only other reason she says she wants to go to that college besides her boyfriend is that it will be academically easy for her.",

Maybe the girl in OP's post wants to be a teacher, or in any other career where one's degree doesn't matter too much.

It's worked out really well because we've been able to work through how communication needs to work and we're both introverted so having the week to focus on our studies has been very helpful. \n\nThat being said, I'm about to apply to a number of very competitive and challenging programs, all of which are out of state. I know myself well enough to know that, yes, I could do well in the program if I was doing it alone, but I'm going to be absolutely miserable for those two years away from my partner and would risk major burnout that I may not be able to recover from.",

It\u2019s really hard to do ngl but we manage to get by visiting each other once every 2-5 months. Last year we were New York to Florida which is quite far, but now being Georgia to Florida the flights are cheaper and quicker. But honestly we still don\u2019t see each other any more often than we used to because of school.\n\nPros of long distance in college: mature faster by learning to navigate a ldr, focus on school more because your s/o isn\u2019t immediately available to distract you, chance to travel and visit a different school which is pretty fun\n\nCons: flights are expensive, you\u2019ll miss each other a LOT, you might be missing out on college hookup culture if you\u2019re into that, you won\u2019t know if cheating is going on, not knowing when the distance will close\n\nIs it a good idea? Nope! But like Selena Gomez said, the heart wants what it wants",

Time moves so fast in college that I never feel like I\u2019ve been without him for too long. and I get to talk to him all the time. He\u2019s my best friend and it\u2019s been an absolute joy to get to share our college experiences with one another, even from far away. Of course, it\u2019s different for everyone, but if you get the feeling that the only thing worse than not being around each other physically is not being with each other at all, then I think you could probably make it work. \n\nPersonally, I would say that a coast to coast difference wouldn\u2019t change much, other than the fact that time zones can make it just a little bit trickier to plan times to facetime or call. Even if you guys are closer, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll have easy and cheap ways to meet each other, so the extent of the distance doesn\u2019t really change much.",

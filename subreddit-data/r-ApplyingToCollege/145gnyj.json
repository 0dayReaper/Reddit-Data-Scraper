    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising HS senior and my dream school is UPenn, and I would 100% attend if I got accepted (cost not an issue for my family). I know the ED acceptance rate is around 15% and the RD acceptance rate is around 2%, but I know that ED students are also way more competitive than RD ones. I feel that I might not be competitive enough for ED as my gpa is around 3.74, and I\u2019ll have to rely on the other parts of my application to carry it. I\u2019ve heard of other people who get into Ivies with much lower gpas so I know I\u2019m not completely out of the question.\n\nHowever, my friend thinks that since I\u2019ll be pursuing an engineering major, I\u2019ll still have a better chance for ED because he thinks most kids who apply ED are for Wharton and Arts &amp; Sciences (not sure if this is logical lol). Tbh we\u2019ve both never heard of a kid who wants to ED Penn for MEAM lmao.\n\nSo basically, I just want to know which is right for me, ED or RD?",

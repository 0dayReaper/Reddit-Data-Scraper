    "postText": "Hi Everyone, I was planning to attend college in Bay Area. I live in San Mateo and am 20 minutes drive to the College of San Mateo and 40 minutes drive to De Anza College. But De Anza already accepted me with financial aid for my out-of-state tuition fees. The only thing left is to register for the classes. But on the other hand,  CSM taking so long time to review my high school certificate and registration. I tried calling the admission team but no luck. The financial aid department said I have to wait for a week which I already did but still no luck. The summer classes gonna start on June/12. Should I still wait for admission to CSM or join De Anza and move on with CSM? I am new in Bay Area so I don't know what to hope for with both options. Any advice must be appreciated.",

Unless the travel is too much, I'd stay with De Anza, especially with the financial aid.\n\nif you're looking to transfer to UCs, this website has the transfer data to each UC: [https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/california-community-college-new-enrollments-uc](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/california-community-college-new-enrollments-uc)",

    "postText": "I'm an international student, gonna apply for fall 2024. I wonder how much the university prestige matters for undergrad(for cs, econ, business studies,), in terms of getting internships, jobs , the curriculum and other stuff. Except for the location, does prestige influence your chances of getting a job( I mean how quickly get one). This leaves me with two important questions:\n\n1) should I choose a cheap university and graduate without any debt(paying back loans can   \nsometimes be tedious)...?\n\n2) OR, should I go to a prestigious university, take loans, and payback the debt later when I get a job..?\n\nPros of Prestigious uni\n\n* strong alumni network\n* Great co-ops\n* Brand Name\n* Great courses( and also in large number)\n* Most of them are at lively locations\n\nCons of Prestigious uni\n\n* Expensive\n* Difficult curriculum \n* Heavy competition\n\nWell, idk much about cheap unis so didn't weigh pros &amp; cons, and I just forgot to tell that I wanna do my masters too(so need money for that as well).",

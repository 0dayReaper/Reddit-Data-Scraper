Video call everyday if you can. Arrange to come home for once a month if you can. Remember there are so many people in your position right now. For the time being, spend as much time as you could with your family before you have to leave and try to maintain that closeness with your family while you're gone.",

            "comment": "We\u2019re a pretty close family but we actually communicated more after my kids went to college.  I received texts about what happened in classes and clubs, upcoming campus concerts and shows, sporting events, weekend and spring break plans, housing searches, courses and course registration, etc.  Pictures were common, too: a photogenic campus squirrel, something truly questionable from the dining hall, or a postcard-worthy campus sunset.  If you are like my kids, you\u2019ve been doing much of the same thing during high school.  Now, you\u2019ll have new experiences to share.  We also found it helpful to agree upon TV shows to save or watch separately so that we\u2019d all have something to watch together during breaks and watch individually and discuss during the academic year. \n\nBeyond that, you\u2019ll find in the fall that you likely have a chance to come home every 4-5 weeks between fall break, Thanksgiving, and winter break.  Also, depending on your relationship, interests, and schedule, your parents may show up at Family Weekend or for a football game and the chance to shower you with restaurant meals and a grocery store/mall run. \n\nAlso, let your family know that you\u2019d like to hear from them, assuming that\u2019s the case.  Some parents and siblings fear that they\u2019ll bring on an attack of homesickness or invade your privacy if they text.  We talked before drop-off and everyone thought that the transition would be easier if we all felt free to say \u201chi\u201d whenever.  So I felt free to text and send gift cards, care packages, boxes of ramen, and pictures of the pets and siblings. \n\nFinally, you can tamp down homesickness by staying busy with classmates and events those first few weeks.  Attend your dorm events and find folks interested in looking for their classrooms, trying the dining halls, and exploring the gym.  Attend any first-year events like concerts, fairs, BBQs, and food truck festivals.  And get yourself to the activities fair and find yourself some clubs, intramurals, and other activities in which to get involved.  Soon you\u2019ll be too busy to spend much time wondering what\u2019s happening at home, and you\u2019ll have great things to share when you do text or call.  Very best of luck!",

The other commenters have some great ideas but maybe you could think of this as quality time versus quantity time. It's true that you will be missing time with your family and possibly some important moments, but you'll gain so many experiences and broaden your world so much wherever you go. But when you are planning to come back home, set up some quality time with your family and it will be amazing. Worst comes to worst, you can transfer later to be closer to home. But at least, try it out and see how well it will surely go.",

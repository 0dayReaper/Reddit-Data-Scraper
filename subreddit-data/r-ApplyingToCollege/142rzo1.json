    "postText": "Hi I'm a rising senior from central California looking for colleges with strong undergraduate programs in Public Health or related fields. I've also considered nursing as an alternative path though that\u2019s a whole other thing altogether. Here's a little background information about me:\n\nAcademics:\n-Current GPA: Approximately 3.6-3.8 (exact GPA to be determined once final grades are available though my district calculates things weird)\n-Graduating with associates next year\n\nExtracurriculars:\n-Volunteering at church and other church activities for like 6ish years\n-orchestra since like 4th grade lol with participation in honor orchestra and smaller ensembles and gigs (am considering playing music in college as I really love the viola)\n-Latina youth leadership program since sophomore year\n-Academic decathlon since freshman year\n-internship with my city last summer\n-nonprofit internship this summer!!\n-small internship with online indie magazine (probably won\u2019t list this &amp; unsure about my other internships lol)\n\nPreferences:\nHonestly I\u2019m not too picky; and just seeking colleges that are less selective, but open to considering some competitive options as well. I\u2019ve already researched the UC's and CSU's I\u2019m interested in applying to (thank goodness for fee waivers I\u2019m applying to 4 of each) but am kind of stuck on where else I should apply minus a couple of schools I\u2019ve heard about like Baylor and Emory :) To be completely honest I\u2019m not really stressing about the college application process since my local CSU accepts pretty much all local students with a qualifying GPA and I\u2019d be totally cool going there and saving my dough, but I don\u2019t want to limit myself! I\u2019m open to any regions really and want to add that I\u2019m Latina if that counts for anything when recommending colleges . Any recommendations will be appreciated and feel free to ask me for any clarifications!!\n\nThank you in advance!",

Ohio State is another to look at - a little more selective, and maybe not quite as generous with scholarships.\n\nA lot of Catholic schools have good programs too - Saint Louis University, Creighton, and Loyola Chicago are ones that come to mind for me as schools that aren't especially competitive for admissions.",

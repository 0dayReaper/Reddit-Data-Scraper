    "postText": "I just finished freshman year, and during the middle of the year i got caught with THC at school and was sent to juvy, i was also sent to an alternative school for 3 months so its likely that that is on my transcript. Luckily I got a deffered adjudication so after probation im done but, I have really prestigious dreams, I really all my life have wanted to get into an ivy league and become a doctor and I\u2019d do anything to make that possible. I also didnt make very good grades this freshman year because of all the mental distress that came with the incident\u2026 But i just would like to know if i did a full 180, what should i do to get into an ivy league considering they know about the juvy.",

If it was a one time thing when you were 14, it won't be an issue, but any additional drug related violations will be a significant red flag.",

Heck, unless you're getting it fully financed with financial aid or your parents are literal multi-millionaires, it wouldn't be worth it for premed IMO.\n\n  \nBut great news, you don't need to go to an ivy to be wildly successful or attend med school or to make your parents proud.  Hundreds if not thousands of great options.  \n\n  \nBefore getting excited about any school, I highly recommend running some net price calculators to see what you can afford and go from there.",

I understand your desire, but best you think of that as a super reach and don't give it a lot of mental time.  Look for target and safety schools given your actual stats.\n\nAnd who knows?  Apply to one, write up a really awesome essay about the food in Juvy, turning your life around, and wanting to help others, and maybe the admitting readers will think you're original and interesting.  Like Dartmouth, not Yale.  They have enough THC-using legacies there ! ;)",

    "postText": "I'm an international student with pretty good grades and ECs. I'm thinking of majoring in Economics + Mathematics. I also need full financial aid. Can you suggest me some liberal arts colleges based on the following.\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n- suburban setting, safe campus (I don't wanna be in a big city for college but also don't wanna be isolated from everything, can people from colleges like Williams share their opinion on rural campuses?)\n- internship opportunities \n- collaborative and accepting environment \n- lots of clubs and societies ( I'm interested in literature, art, theater, everything, give them to me!)\n- sports (I've never been a big sports person but I want to start watching sports now)\n-  challenging but also fun\n-  pretty places to hike and stuff\n\nWhat I'm not sure of:\n- Rural Campus (I don't wanna be in a big city for college but also don't wanna be isolated from everything, can people from colleges like Williams share their opinion on rural campuses?)\n- Open Curriculum ( this one is said to be good but I wanna learn everything  so I don't think I'd mind having to take a few specific classes to graduate...?)\n\nThank you for your time.",

They're need blind for internationals, meaning the amount you can pay isn't a factor for them\u2014getting accepted is still very difficult, but it is better compared to all the other LACs which are need aware for internationals.",

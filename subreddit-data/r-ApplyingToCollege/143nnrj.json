Your math grade is a little concerning, but it looks like you just need to find Jesus and you\u2019ll be set.  I recommend trying a church.  I hear he visits some of them on occasion\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t want to give you too much hope because social clubs are so subjective, but the fact that you got an F (which of course stands for Frat) in Lunch cub tells me that you could be on some very powerful Yale Alumni\u2019s radar now.  Get that Frat from and F- to an F+ so you can be Frat as Fu\u20ack, and you\u2019re set",

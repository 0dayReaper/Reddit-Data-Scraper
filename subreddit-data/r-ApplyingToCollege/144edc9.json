    "postText": "I'm an international student (class of 2023), and the college app season recently ended for me. I was rejected from nearly all my US schools, except for a few which, unfortunately, couldn't provide me with sufficient aid/scholarships for me to be able to afford them. I have ONE acceptance from a T30 on a FULL TUITION SCHOLARSHIP, but the condition is near impossible to attain; after my IB exams, I'm not too hopeful.\n\nI got into my local university (the best university in my country), but they dont have the major I've wanted to do for the longest time (Mechanical Engineering), and instead I'd have to do electrical engineering. There are other colleges in my country that do offer MechE, but that would entail sitting multiple admission tests over this summer for colleges that rank far below the one I have been admitted to. \n\nI made this post because I have never been this lost in my life. I'm still not over my US rejections and nearly cry myself to sleep every night lmao because I cannot stop thinking about the fact that I just wasn't enough for pretty much everyone. I'm stuck in a drowning country, being, somewhat, forced to enroll in a major different from the one I had intended to pursue, aaaannnddd I have absolutely no idea what to do. \n\nI would love to apply to any colleges in Europe that are still accepting applications and would be affordable for me, but I'm not sure where to start. I just don't have it in me to do anything - It's like I've given up on life quite literally.",

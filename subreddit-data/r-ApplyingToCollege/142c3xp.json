    "postText": "Hi everyone! I already started university in 2022 September (enrolled in Maths and Computer Science), but I don't wish to study in my country anymore, never did anyway. I plan on taking a GAP year and applying to universities in this year, as well as improving myself in programming, and doing EC activities like establishing my own organization along with working abroad.\n\nIn high school, I think my ECs were decent enough, I did volunteering, I was being active in organizations, school clubs and some competitions. I also have an idea notebook where I constantly write the new app, project, organization ideas in detailed. I can send my CV for further discussion in DMs. I graduated with a 88,4 overall high school degree (94,37 in 12th and 90,72 in 11th, I think some universities don't count the first two years' grades.), along with the certification of merit and certification of honour. I can get recommandation letters from my teachers and take IELTS (in the mock exams I was getting 7.5 without the writing part), and SAT/ACT if needed.  Though, I mostly plan on applying to European Universities, I am learning German at the moment, so most probably to German or Swiss universities.\n\nMy problem is that I plan on applying to their Computer Science programs but until the end of high school, I pretty much didn't do anything in terms of programming, like building my GitHub profile and so on. I only wrote a few articles on some languages and that's it. So, I am not really good at programming yet. Do you think I have a chance get accepted from some good universities, the top 200 ones in the world, top 50 in Europe? And what are your recommandations on applying to universities in the field of CS when someone barely had activities in CS?\n\nAlso, I think I can have my credits count. I had 5 Maths (Analysis 1-2, Linear Algebra 1, Abstract Math, Analytical Geometry) and 3 Computer Science (Intro to Computer Science, Intro to Algorithms and Programming Languages 1) classes. Do you think it will be too late to start a new university at 20? Transferring is also an option, but how does transferring schools works ? I appreciate your answers.",

So I talked about divestment, ESG, the finance side of things, worker relations etc.\n\nYou could talk more about the science side of it (geology, chem eng and so forth). The owner of an oil company definitely needs practical knowledge of earth sciences given that his money comes from there. In fact, I'm p sure he would have hired a geology major at some point.\n\nEnvironmental scientists in my experience aren't really seen as \"SJWs\" so I doubt it'll be too bad for you.",

You're not the enemy, other oil companies are. \n\nAlmost all major oil companies right now are hiring climate change experts to help them \"perform studies on environmental and sustainability practices\". It helps them look better for shareholders and they know that there's a ton of money to be made before it does.\n\nCheck out pages like [https://www.exxon.com/en/environment](https://www.exxon.com/en/environment) and [https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/sustainability/environment.html](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/sustainability/environment.html) and learn some of the lingo for your questions. \n\nBasically, position yourself as a future consultant or researcher who could help them look good in front of their shareholders and the public, and they'll love you. Remember--their goal isn't oil, but **money**, and there's a lot of money in talking about going carbon neutral right now.",

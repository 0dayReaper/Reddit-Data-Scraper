Regarding a non-academic recommendation, it depends on what the type. If it is an internship/job, they should be talking about your performance. If it is some sort of volunteer work, they can mention your activism and community service.",

Do u think it might be repetitive tho if they happen to both write some of the same things in my rec or am I just over thinking this lol? And if it\u2019s an internship, do I need to provide any info besides my resume or just let them talk abt my performance?",

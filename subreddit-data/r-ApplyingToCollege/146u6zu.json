    "postText": "is it feasible to look for research opportunities in us universities as an international student? i live in asia and have no plans to relocate to the us, but i still want to try my luck at getting remote research attachments with us uni professors as i want to study in us in the future. if it\u2019s possible, i just have a few questions about the process\n\n1. how do i select professors to email for a research project i want to do, and can i email more than 1 professor from the same faculty in the same uni, or will it seem like too much?\n\n2. when should i send out emails if i wish to begin the research project in november?\n\n3. is it advisable to email an entire faculty/an entire university instead of a specific professor?",

            "comment": "Honestly, I think you'd be better off trying to find (or create/lead) opportunities of interest local to you.  Not necessarily research.\n\nA lot of the students in the US doing research either have an inside connection, are doing pay to play based opportunites, or maybe have won some sort of opportunity.  There are some that maybe happen to be local to a university and somehow wiggled their way into a lab, but even that is fairly unique and may have some indirect contacts  no one will ever hear about.\n\nI mean you can send emails, but your time may be better spent both for your app and for you personally looking out your front door.  It's more work for these profs to have undergrads under their noses let alone a high school trying to work remote.",

Often it\u2019s the grad students who need help as they don\u2019t have \u201cstaff\u201d but it\u2019s still under the professors lab.\n\nBlanket, non specific emails won\u2019t get a response.\n\nUnderstand that research opportunities are hard to get even for undergrads at college. So as a HS student you really have to stand out to be interesting to them. Most HS students in the US don\u2019t do research unless the school has a pre established relationship with a particular college.",

            "comment": "Note that PIs are incredibly busy people and you will most likely not get a reply. If you do, it will probably be take a couple weeks and will be a rejection. Unless the research can be done remotely you almost will not get a position.I know student at my university that took 15+ emails to land a position. But it does hurt to try; you'll at least get experience with writing good cold-emails and delving into more advanced literature. I'd also recommend attaching your CV to the email.\n\n1. Look at the university faculty page and look into each PIs research. Often they will have a lab website you an look at and read some of their publications. You can email multiple faculty in the same department even just don't overdo it. Also make sure your email are genuine and not simply a copy/paste and changing a few words.\n2. I would reach out for a volunteer position starting anytime. Wanting to begin in November limits what PIs will take you on.\n3. I would email each PI individually. That shows you are interested in their group in particular even if you are also interested in other groups as well. Mass-emailing the same generic email to everyone seems like you're just trying to get into research just for the sake of it, not because you are genuinely interested.",

            "comment": "Thank you's. Don't necessarily begin with cliches or jokes, but have jokes in the speech. Instead start with thank you's which are much more important. Don't make this sad or gloomy, or course, but make the thank you's sincere and upbeat. \n\nToo many graduating students ignore the fact that their parents and their teachers worked especially hard to get them where they are now. You need to thank them. And make it sincere. \n\nSomething like \"I want to celebrate my amazing class, but more importantly, I want to thank all of our parents for all the time and effort and support each one of them gave to us. They raised us from the beginning. They helped us get into great schools. They answered our questions and listened to our problems. They put up with our whining. And through their efforts for years, as well as ours, here we are now graduating. Thank you, parents, every one of you.\"  This also establishes you as a very good person -- and every parent out there will now be on your side -- and they will be listening. \n\n\"Besides our amazing parents who helped us get here today, I also want to thank all of our amazing teachers . . . \" Don't start listing teachers by name because you're bound to leave some out, but you could give a couple or three anecdotes of ways teachers went out of their way to help you and mention their names.  That would personalize what you're saying. Acknowledge their hard work and support and what they often had to put up with from you and your classmates, and do it with real thanks and with a sense of humor: \"Teaching is sometimes a thankless job. It's underpaid and often under-appreciated by society, but without these amazing teachers who spent every day of their lives for the last few years educating us, we could never have learned, and we would not be here today.\" \n\nThen tie both groups together: \"So I'd like everyone to join me in applauding our amazing parents and our amazing teachers right now to thank them.\" APPLAUSE.\n\n2 minutes total. You establish yourself as a very good person this way, and you will definitely get everyone's attention much better than with some lame joke or movie reference which you'd expect from a kid. Thanking people is what adults do, so you establish yourself as an adult when you do this. \n\nThen you could describe each year of your class's history from 9-12th with a few remarks about each of them: \"When we arrived here four years ago, we were scared little 9th graders . . . . \" but do this pretty briefly and don't drag it out. Maybe 1-2 minutes and no more. \n\nOr you could describe the world for the last four years, a kind of \"what we lived through\" summary. That helps people remember. Or mention key moments in your class's four years in school. \n\nAdd any funny comments here -- but never make a joke at someone else's expense, but only at yours. Never insult in a speech even if you're tempted to, or you'll lose all the good you've just established. Only positive comments, a few jokes, and sincerity. That works best. \n\nThe rest of your short speech can be what you hope the class accomplishes later, college, keeping in touch with each other, maybe mention the sadness of leaving, the sadness of not seeing some old friends again, but the joy of becoming an adult and taking on new responsibilities now. Maybe mention that some of the people now graduating will become teachers, doctors, lawyers, corporate executives, and that it's right to expect a lot from you and your friends -- \"and we hope we don't disappoint you\" or something like that. \n\nThe tone should be thankful, humble, and funny where possible. It should not be too jokey or wise-guy or any other teenagey thing, or you will alienate and turn off your audience. And keep it short. 5-10 minutes is more than enough. Also, practice it relentlessly in front of a mirror at home until it's completely comfortable for you to say even without notes in front of you. I mean about 30x or more, correcting parts that don't seem genuine, editing the words, and just making it flow better. And time yourself. \n\nAlso, have fun.",

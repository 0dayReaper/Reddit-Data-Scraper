    "postText": "Hi there, \n\nI'm currently a rising senior starting to get ready for college apps so it's a given I'm starting to narrow down my list of college choices. Right now I want to aim for UC Irvine, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Riverside or UC Santa Barbara but I have a slight conflict. I have discussed my choice of colleges with my parents, but they're trying to convince me to reconsider and choose community college so I can stay close to home and just transfer later on (if they let me.) I've been torn about the whole situation, I really want to go far from home since I'm not a fan of my hometown and just explore being on my own in college but I also don't want my parents to really get upset over the fact that I don't want to be near home anymore and won't listen to their suggestion. \n\nShould I really just stay around the area and not at least try to convince my parents to let me go far? Please help.\n\n(Edit: My siblings have already graduated college over a few years ago, but I also asked my parents about it and it\u2019s not really the financial issue they\u2019re looking at.)",

It seems that while your parents don\u2019t want you to go far away, you do. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, and many other students feel the same way. But I want to remind you that YOU are going to college, not your family. I recommend you to sit down and try to argue your point. \n\nPlus, if it turns out you go to a CC and you want to transfer out later, your parents still may not let you.",

Cc credits are like 500 for a whole semester in California vs in state tuition at a university is 8k per quarter assuming you have no fin aid. Having done both id say CCs in california are generally really good. Its only worth it to go to ucla or uc Berkeley for 4 years mostly for the networking, at other schools it wont be as strong so it doesnt matter. Id say if you dont get into ucla or ucb then just do CC cause then you get another chance at the top schools.",

Of course one additional benefit is that it gives you a few more years of growing up, but you may or may not want that. The financial and tactical benefits of this pathway are very clear though.",

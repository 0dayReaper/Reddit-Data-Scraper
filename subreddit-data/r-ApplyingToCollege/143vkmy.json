There are lots of potential targets and reaches out there, but if they don't fit what you want it doesn't really make sense to apply to them.  Rose Hulman is a good example - it's a very good engineering school with good outcomes, and may be of interest if you like WPI; but it's a smaller school that's all engineering, predominantly male, and in Terre Haute, Indiana so certainly doesn't appeal to everyone.",

So if an applicant has good grades but bad ACT/SAT or was unable to take the test, then they will be able to submit their application without test scores. Additionally, some students who were admitted last year into the Class of 2024 decided to take a gap year due to Covid-19. This means that there are less spots available for the Class of 2025. All of this together led to a sharp increase in applicants and a sharp decrease in acceptance rates. I hope this helps!",

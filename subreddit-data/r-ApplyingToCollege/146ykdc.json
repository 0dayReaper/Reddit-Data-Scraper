    "postText": "Hello! I wanted some advice regarding my idea for a passion project and whether it\u2019s a good idea and advice on how to go through with it. \n\nI am currently a sophomore heading into my junior year. I want to go into psychology. My ideal for a passion project is to connect to kids who don\u2019t have a passion or do not have the resources to find their own. I really want to do this because when I was struggling through covid. I found my own passion through writing and that really helped my well-being. I want for others to have something they can connect to just as writing has done for me. \n\nIf anyone has any idea on how I can make this into a real thing and actually make me work. That would be so helpful \ud83e\udef6",

I\u2019ve always been obsessed with the idea of being someone who can help others smile and it\u2019s been a common point throughout my life. Being passionate abt smth can help people enjoy and smile abt something in their life. I didn\u2019t mean for it to come off as something just to help me with college and I understand how it came off that way. However I can\u2019t completely lie and say that I wouldn\u2019t have come up with the idea if it wasn\u2019t for the looming date of college applications. But I appreciate you for genuinely opening my eyes at my logic.",

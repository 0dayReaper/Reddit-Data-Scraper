    "postText": "I'm only an upcoming junior so I'm not actually applying until late-ish 2024, but I want to get ideas now so I don't actually struggle when the time comes. Do we write about literally anything? Or do we HAVE to explain why I chose to go to that specific college?\n\nAnd can we write the same essay for multiple applications, or do we write different ones for each college? (I'm considering about 6-7 colleges)",

            "comment": "For your personal (common app) essay, you can write about any topic you want. There are a lot of guides(do\u2019s and don\u2019ts)and examples of how it should generally go. The hardest part is thinking of an initial idea or ideas that you could explore and flesh out in your essay. The topic should be something personal to you, whether it be a subject you\u2019ve explored, things you\u2019ve experienced, or other unconventional ideas. Remember, a lot of people self-judge their first draft as their final draft and hesitate in writing their thoughts down. The whole point of writing essays early is to get your initial thoughts down and keep improving upon them as time passes. \n\nNow supplemental essay questions are essays that you need to write for each individual university you apply to, if they have them. A lot of universities have their \u201cWhy Us?\u201d or \u201cWhy did you choose this major\u201d prompt here, as well as potentially more prompts. This is where you have to answer the specific questions they ask. \n\nFor your personal (common app) essay, it is just one essay that will be submitted to all of the schools. For supplemental essays usually, I\u2019d recommend you try and write a unique essay for each university you apply to, although I know many students (including myself) procrastinate and apply to too many schools, so they end up reusing some or most of the content of one supplemental essay in another.",

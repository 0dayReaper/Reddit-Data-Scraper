    "postText": "2.5 months after I got my last rejection and I'm still bitter. \n\nThroughout high school I coasted by and managed a 3.84 gpa with some aps, dual enrollment classes, and a handful of extracurriculars, but didn't do too much. Got a first SAT score of 1350 and after a couple retakes of similar scores decided that was it. I kind of resigned myself to just going to my state school and calling it a day, as that seemed to be about what was going to happen.\n\nThe summer before my senior year however, several events caused me to have the great epiphany that i wanted more than just that. I decided to have some agency and try to change that path, and I decided to just shut up and do the tedious work in an effort to go somewhere else and do what I want to do. Over the next couple of months and through hundreds of hours of work, I managed to hammer out a 1540 SAT, 4.0 senior year GPA, 35 ACT, and college essays that at the time I believed were works I would have to try my damnedest to further improve. I also managed to add a couple of extracurriculars and titles to my Applications, like concertmaster of an orchestra and developing a hobby into a business. I applied to a bunch of reach schools, a handful of targets that I wanted to go to, and a handful of in-state safeties including, again, my state school.\n\nI basically no-lifed my senior year with the hopes that the return would make it worth it. I barely talked to friends and my only drive forward was to conquer the next big challenge. I genuinely thought the effort would pay off, but come march and april, the turnout was the same. Rejected from every single target and reach, and so I numbly put my deposit down for my state school the day after my last rejection.\n\nI thought the bitterness and anger at the entire situation would go away after a while but it hasn't. I tried my best and pushed myself beyond anything I thought I could do before and the result was the same. I've visited the school 3 times to try to remedy some bitterness and maybe make myself feel better about it but to no avail. I feel like my only hope of being able to go anywhere else is to shut up and do more work for the next 4 years with the hopes of going somewhere for grad school, but now I don't even feel certain that the work I put in will turn out to anything. \n\nI just feel stuck and bitter right now and really want to find a way forward, but just not sure where to go from here. Its a long shot, but really any advice?",

They barely slept and had no social life for four years. These people still ended up going to their state school.  So you\u2019re not alone. But the time and effort you spent is not lost. Hopefully you learned something valuable from your leadership and EC experience that will make you into a better person in the future.",

I became an emt as part of my grind and it was the best thing I ever did, and all the scholarships i got to my state school made it possible for me to be in control of toxic relationships with my family because I really can be finacially independent. Plus I know that I can do anything I want to do, because I have done harder, killed it just didnt get the reward I wanted. I will never know if the work would have been worth it if I did get in, but I am happy where I am now. (Still salty personally though that I worked so hard for schools that knowing my families finaces now, I still wouldnt have been able to go to if I got in. Really makes the whole thing feel like a waste of time, but I did get a lot of good out of it. Have to stay positive)",

GT is a great school though, it's a tier below the best schools but it's worth it. Our state's A2C definition of a \"state school\" is Georgia State since UGA has some very good programs. I would say UGA is shifting a lot because it's getting more competitive based on major.\n\nEither way, for the effort the people you know put in, they at least deserve to go to Georgia Tech, if not a T20.",

UGA is about 50th nationally so barely a T50 school and certainly nowhere near UC Berkeley, U of Texas, U Michigan, Ohio State and many of the others. You do know there are only 50 states, right? That makes it a pretty average state university -- which isn't bad at all. It's perfectly possibly to go to UGA or GaTech and get a fabulous education just as you can at #100, whatever that is. But trying to massage the ranking numbers this way is not helpful. And you know that someone who goes to whatever school is ranked #100 says \"Out of more than a thousand American universities, mine is a Top 100 university, so it's one of the best.\" Not wrong, but a little \"off\" maybe.",

My daughter\u2019s college is a little state school in Texas, ranked something like 160th in the nation.  The program she is in though is literally the number 1 ranked program in the entire country.  Out of all of the state and private schools it is the oldest and highest ranked program with every single student that wants to going on to fully funded masters programs.  Stop worrying about college rank and start looking at how good the programs are as that tends to say far more about your future opportunities whether it be graduate school or career.",

But it\u2019s #1 for packaging, really good for supply chain management, and has the #1 graduate programs for primary and secondary education, with many other education programs ranked at least top ten. If one wants to go into those fields, it is an excellent choice, and one that is often overlooked because it\u2019s \u201conly\u201d ranked 74 or something. \n\nIf you take out the privates, which arguably have unfair advantages in the rankings (wealth), and just use public universities, it\u2019s top 30. Yet people still spit on it and don\u2019t consider it until they have to. Not to mention excellent sports teams, music (performing arts center that broadway shows perform at), and a gorgeous campus.\n\nI\u2019m not even going there, or anywhere in state for that matter, but there is still a lot to love.",

One spectacular grade or a couple of months in an EC doesn't show that you will consistently be a good student. Yes, you tried hard for one year and yes it was basically perfect. However, that doesn't compare to the students that tried hard for three years, were imperfect, but were genuinely good students. Because what they show in their applications isn't just a random spike fueled by the motivation that would die as soon as they get into a top school. They show discipline. That even when they screw up, they are able to pick themselves up. Even if you are capable of that, it's not what you showed them. That's the difference. And that difference matters because University is a lot different from high school. At those top schools, you are with the best of the best, and sometimes that means feeling like a failure. You have to show them you can handle failing and continue to strive towards education.\n\nYou're allowed to feel how you want to feel, and are completely valid in your disappointment. But if you want to move forward, you have to accept that you simply were not a top school student at the time you applied, and coasting by just to pick up your grades when it mattered wasn't enough. You only feel bitter because you think you deserved it but in reality, you've admitted that you didn't really try.\n\nIf a top school is where you want to go for grad, remember the amazing thing you are capable of and become that student EVERY year.\n\nTo any future top school applicant reading this, know that with the increasing number of applications going to these schools, AOs can smell bullshit from a mile away. I'm not saying you have to have always had a t-10 in mind as your dream school. Honestly, the school I'm going to, I hadn't even done proper research until the summer before senior year. But top schools accept top, consistent students. Don't try to mold yourself into what you think they want to see. Be consistent and you'll have the highest chance.",

It is reasonable to be unsatisfied, your core stats look okay. Heres what I would recommend: \n\nOption 1: Transfer App- Sophomore Year\n\nYour gonna have decent odds for a school like NYU here, if you maintain a 3.7+, do a summer internship, get one solid rec letter and put together a compelling essay. Transfer for true elite schools is kinda a crap shoot, but generally if you blanket apply one can work out in your favor\n\nOption 2: GAP YEAR\n\nIf your ECA's are inadequate, or lack focus and a clear narrative (my guess is you grinded standard ECA's generically instead of as a means to tell a narrative) taking a year off can help, people also just respect adults more and will give them basic internship opportunities you wouldn't otherwise get.  Do an internship, work very carefully on your essays and reapply. Good odds there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOption 3: International Admissions\n\nThis assumes gap year obviously but you should be cognizant of the fact that applicants who have solid academic stats but are weaker on the ECA side, should always apply to the UK and Canada. They will have a much better run there and will likely get into top schools (Oxford, imperial lse.) The UCAS APP is not work intensive and is very cheap. I consider it the best investment you can make during your college process because it gives you peace of mind. \n\nALSO they missed your second 4.0 semester obviously. \n\nTLDR: Take a gap year, get concrete work experience and try and tell a concrete narrative rather than farming ECA's. Apply to the UK and Canada, you will hear back by December at the latest from a couple solid schools, giving you room to dream and aim high. \n\nPeople will tell you move on or do a transfer app, its possible that that could work. But, I dont see a point personally, in limiting your options, when a year could provide some real clarity. If you feel you'll waste a year doing jack, then go to state school but given your core stats, I dont see why you wouldnt at least interview at Oxford, and get into all 3 elite Canadian schools at a minimum.",

The important thing to remember is that college admissions is kind of just a numbers game, a bunch of perfectly qualified students apply and admissions have to turn many away. Hoenstly, you probably will have to figure out the fun stuff at your state school. All the clubs at mine looked boring when I first went, but you make friends, and hear from friends of friends about what seems interesting. It sucks a lot right now but I promise that it will get better. You have all the skills now from senior year to succeed! \n\nOnce you get there and realize there\u2019s lots of different social circles and cool people, and maybe even interesting classes, things will turn around for you.

            "comment": "The best school for you is necessarily one of the ones which you can comfortably afford, where you will enjoy your studies, get really good grades, develop relationships with the top professors in your program, and also generally stay a happy, social, energized person.\n\nAmong whatever schools those might be, you probably wouldn't want to choose one that is actually considered bad for biology.  But biology is such a popular major that almost no competitive college is going to actually be bad in biology relative to its perceived peers.\n\nSo basically, you really shouldn't be building or narrowing down your college list based on which schools are \"best\" for biology.  However, if you are coming down to a final decision on whether to apply to A or B based on important criteria, and really are torn and are desperate for a tiebreaker that has any sort of logic to it  . . . .\n\nIf you actually have some ideas about what kind of biology you want to study, check out their course offerings.  Maybe one will stand out more.  In fact, this should really be covered at an earlier stage because some Bio departments specialize in some ways.\n\nBut if both A and B generally cover your desired fields and their specific course list is not a tiebreaker for you . . . .\n\nIf only one is an LAC, I'd suggest choosing that.  LACs in general tend to provide a better combination of experience and placement in natural sciences like biology than peer research universities.\n\nBut if they are both LACs or both universities . . . .\n\nMaybe the bigger LAC or the smaller university?  This is designed to be a tiebreaker that is always implementable.  And while the logic is very weak, basically a bigger LAC is less likely to end up feeling a little limited in faculty and lab resources, and a smaller university is less likely to end up feeling like there is too much competition for the top faculty and lab resources.  Again, not the strongest logic, but also not the worst way to make a final decision.",

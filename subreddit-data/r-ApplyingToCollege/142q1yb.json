    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a rising senior, and so far I have one teacher who is willing to write me a (most likely decent) letter of recommendation.\n\nI want to get my second LOR in stem and from my future AP bio teacher next year. If I were to ask my current stem teachers (ap chem and pre-Calc) I\u2019m sure id get a generic letter because I didn\u2019t exactly form a close relationship with them.\n\nWould there be enough time next year to create a close relationship and get a unique letter of recommendation from my senior year AP bio teacher? Has anyone else done that, and if so how\u2019d it work out?",

    "postText": "About a week ago my friend invited me to a jungle obstacle course 50 ft in the sky and w my fear of heights, I said yes because feeling proximity to death is a needed reminder that life is a privilege and an opportunity.\n\nAfterwards I confronted my plan of jamming myself into a biological engineering career to appease my family and conform to a tech-centric generation despite hating physics and chemistry and being inept at math. \n\nAfter I (seemingly) came close to falling to death multiple times that day, I acknowledged that I really loved was psychology. It fascinates me and a more humanities-oriented field has always been where my aptitude lies.\n\nThe problem is, I chose Purdue, an awful premed school with higher tuition, over OSU (honors) with less grade deflation and cheaper tuition. So I emailed OSU, gushing and sucking them off for a chance to reconsider my acceptance after May 1. OSU told me they\u2019d still honor my acceptance but only for spring start.\n\nI\u2019m extremely grateful, but I\u2019m worried about wasting a semester of my life while my peers are starting immediately.\n\nWhat are the unspoken drawbacks of spring start? Should I stick with Purdue or still go with OSU? And as a person with chronic indecisiveness about area of study, how \u201cversatile\u201d of a school is OSU? I\u2019d love to hear anyone else\u2019s stories or advice.",

            "comment": "Even if you start in the spring, you\u2019ll still ideally finish your degree in four years (or eight semesters) with the option of a December graduation. Also, colleges don\u2019t really recognize the completion of your freshman, sophomore, and junior year.  You simply attend until you\u2019ve earned the credits needed to graduate (usually around 120-128). So once you arrive on campus, you will be having pretty much the same college experience as your peers.  And some of your peers may wind up staying an extra semester if they change majors, decide to double major, have difficulty getting necessary classes during registration or have to retake a class for a required grade. \n\nAs for the \u201cwaste,\u201d it\u2019s four months of what will hopefully be a long life.  Many students intentionally opt for a 12-month gap year to recharge, investigate potential careers, work, or travel.  Finding something to keep you occupied for a few months seems a small price to attend your preferred university, particularly when doing so will save you $$$ for medical school or a PhD.",

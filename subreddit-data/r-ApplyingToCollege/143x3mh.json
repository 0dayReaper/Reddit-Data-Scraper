    "postText": "I love STEM - but not enough to do extracurriculars in it. I tried to join them throughout high school, but the kids were typically boring shut ins, and I was drawn to the newspaper and performance arts extracurriculars.\n\nI\u2019m prob going to double major in chemistry and theater (maybe poli sci instead) at a LAC. I also have an idea in my essay that emphasizes that I want to focus on chemistry and have theater on the side. However, the only thing that shows that I like stem is that I will have taken all ap sciences and calc bc.\n\nIs this something to be concerned about?",

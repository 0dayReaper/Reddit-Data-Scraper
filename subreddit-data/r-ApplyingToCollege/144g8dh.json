You can\u2019t just \u201ctransfer to an ivy\u201d like it\u2019s an easy process\n\n3. People specify ivys as where they\u2019ll transfer because they\u2019re embarrassed they didn\u2019t get in. It\u2019s a completely ficticous thing they 99.9% won\u2019t actually consider even trying to do, much less attempt or succeed at \n\n4. Applying to a lot of schools and being accepted does not have any correlation on other peoples acceptances. There are waitlists and colleges understand when students are overqualified and likely going elsewhere and adjust acceptance amounts based on that \n\n5.

And you know what I did with the nine schools (four of which were selective) that I didn't get into? I told them I would not be attending. You know why? Because they can then give that slot the someone who was WAITLISTED. That is what happens when a school actually wants someone, but they don't have space, or they were even close to getting in to begin with. Someone applying and getting in does not take space from someone who was denied outright. That's just a wrong way of thinking. Not to mention that many of the schools people apply to are reaches, which they mostly don't get into. This hurts no one except maybe the admissions team, but it can always help to reach for the stars on the off chance you land on the moon instead of falling back to earth. Beyond any of this, the more colleges people apply to, the more opportunity they have. I'd rather have more options. You never know who will give better financial aid, which may change people's thinking about certain schools. Sometimes it takes many to find one that works.\n\nYou complain about trolls, yet your vast lack of understanding of how anything, including the world, works, makes you seem like one.",

Alot of people cannot realistically evaluate their profile to such an extent that they only have to apply to a few schools. We are just a bunch of teenagers trying to increase our chances cause admissions officers have decades of experience and may evaluate us in a different light then we did. Not being able to go to college just cause you didnt apply to enough places will be extremely difficult to cope with.\nAlso a gap year becomes increasingly difficult to justify due to extreme competition",

But I do agree with you that these schools have become so basic that they all accept the same student and you\u2019re right, it does suck for the one who didn\u2019t get in but is qualified and really wants to go to that particular school. But that\u2019s why I think your position on transferring needs to be reconsidered. Like you need to rethink it. Because if a person is really committed to a school, but they can\u2019t get in as a freshman, but then they can possibly transfer in their second year, I have no problem with that. For some reason even seems like it\u2019s a lot easier to transfer than it is to get in as a freshman because of using these crazy algorithms where they all accept the same people. And you can\u2019t blame the students who shotgun because there is some anecdotal data out there that shows it works. But it does feel really bad when you see one person getting four or five acceptances into top 30 schools and somebody else getting nothing even though that other person is super well qualified. The Wall Street Journal wrote an article about something like this last year. It\u2019s pretty crazy.",

Financial aid is calculated with the idea that your family is willing and able to pay up to a certain amount. If you can, sit down and have a serious conversation with them to confirm.             \n             \nYou should run the Net Price Calculators for Maryland publics and some private schools you may be interested in to see how much need-based aid you can expect to get and how much you can expect to pay. From there, you can decide whether it would be worth it to get loans to make up the difference for a particular school\u2014I'm not too knowledgeable about this, but from my understanding you should look into consider how much you could pay off with part-time and summer jobs, how much interest would accumulate over your time in college, and what the \"added value\" of having a degree from a particular institution would have on your salary and therefore your ability to pay off debt.    \n             \nYou can also look into merit-based scholarships which can help. This also isn't something I know too much about, so I'd advise you to look into the schools on your list to see if they offer merit scholarships, other schools not in your list that offer merit scholarships (for example UAlabama is known for generous scholarships based on test scores that OOS students can get), and third party scholarships you could qualify for.",

Also, most UC schools, except for Berkeley, are on a quarter system. A lot of people dread that, so definitely look into that.\n\nI uneccesarily applied to many schools that I am baffled at why I even applied to them looking back. Its a waste of time and money. \n\nYour safeties, UVA, UCB, UMD, and Caltech are the ones I'd apply to. If you want to apply to more, shoot higher and consider CMU, UMich, Cornell, Duke, and Stanford(likes published research). These schools will offer more for the money even if you decide to switch from CS to something else. \n\nAs for JHU. I honestly wouldn't even prioritize applying to it. JHU just doesn't seem like a great college experience. Also, it isn't even particularly strong in CS relative to many of the other schools on your list. Consider applying to some of the unis that I listed above instead. \n\nFor your application, hilight your personal projects and research experiences.",

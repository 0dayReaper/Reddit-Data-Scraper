    "postText": "\ni go to a school that\u2019s well below 1k kids and we have 10 aps offered total. i\u2019ve taken and will take every one of them except bio (school won\u2019t let me take it since i couldn\u2019t skip a year of science from my regent due to covid, and there\u2019s schedule interference either way since i\u2019ll be taking chem \ud83d\udc94)\n\nwould schools consider the fact that my hs just has less aps and be fine with me taking less by default? i\u2019m a varsity athlete and have been one all four years (wrestling takes up a *fuckton* of time) so i\u2019m not gonna self-study like 6 other aps.\n\nhopefully it wouldn\u2019t affect my rigor as i\u2019m taking ALL of the hardest courses that are offered at my school, since i\u2019ll also be taking 2 college level courses that aren\u2019t aps on top of my aps.",

    "postText": "I just finished out junior year with only joining a sport my junior year. I started volunteering at my local nursing home since may. I have worked at my fast food job since July of last year. Don\u2019t know if it counts but I helped out my dad at his auto shop for almost all of my sophomore year. This is all I have done. college applications are coming soon and Im feeling down. Should I join a variety of clubs my senior year, volunteer a lot more at my nursing home, or do nothing at all. I want to get into college.",

            "comment": "Helping your dad in your family business and the fast food job is valuable work experience. Breadth is certainly important in terms of showing your personal interests and skills, but depth is just as important in the activities you current have. I'd definitely recommend continuing activities you have a chance to make a significant impact in to show commitment and growth over years rather than spread your time over new activities you'd do for a couple months. If there is something that you do want to pickup, don't think its too late to start though. Just make sure it falls in line with your personal interest and story.\n\nHow are your stats looking as well? Your grades, academic rigor, and standardized tests play a important chunk in evaluating your current situation.",

I'd recommend continuing if you enjoy it and if there's some way to get deeper involvements in those areas. The way people get interesting stories and unique applications are when people go out of their way to take on more responsibilities/leadership and really go deep into what they're involved in. \n\nIn terms of GPA, its definitely not the worst but focus on the upwards trend and grind your last semesters. If you need to retake and boost those scores, definitely invest the time to grind and improve. Whether you need a tutor or a larger study frame, do what you need to do",

    "postText": "Four months ago: December 1st, 2020 at 12:48 AM. I had just finished my UC applications and was talking to friends about which colleges I would be applying to via the Common App. \n\nI decided that night that I would do something no sane overworked 17 year old should, [I would apply to Stanford with zero intention of attending if I was to be accepted.](https://imgur.com/a/VX4rGz4) \n\nWhile I had considered Stanford in the past, I had concluded after months of research and speaking with students at both universities that for my major, Political Science, Stanford was only a little better than UC Berkeley academically, and for my other passion of Public Policy, Stanford was significantly worse. This alongside organizing opportunities I had at Berkeley, but not Stanford, and the difference in culture, alongside the elitism and snobbery I had witnessed first hand at Stanford overnight programs I attended, made Stanford very undesirable for me in comparison to UC Berkeley. \n\nBut more than any of that, I saw an injustice in the college application system: the yield rates were too damn high, and those elitist fools were gonna pay.\n\nI spent the next month crafting the perfect Stanford application, I needed to get in. I had dozens of friends, teachers, and family members read over my essays. I had a low mid 3.8 GPA, so I had to make up for it somewhere, and I did so with the story I brought to their school. I shared my family\u2019s struggles with homelessness and finances, and how that motivated me to take action, I shared my love for progressivism and experiences organizing, and just as these experiences would help me get into Stanford, they also shaped my hate for elitist institutions, it made me the perfect Trojan Horse. Little did Stanford know: this prole would be lowering their yield rate. \n\nViva la Revolution!\n\n--\n\n\nTwo days ago: April 7th, 2021 at 4:02 PM. I checked my Stanford portal. [I got in.](https://imgur.com/21SGSF9)\n\nIt was genuinely unexpected, I had just gotten waitlisted at Princeton the night before, and plenty of universities with much higher acceptance rates had already rejected me. Even more surprisingly, they had given me a full ride in gift aid (although Cal gave me something close). \n\nWith the acceptance came a whirlpool of emotions, did I make the right choice in my plan to turn them down? Would I be ruining my future? Did I deserve to get in? But I was a man on a mission, I would lower their yield rate if it was the last thing I do. \n\nThe next few days, I spent time speaking to friends and loved ones about my acceptance to Stanford, and my plans to turn them down, many people rejected my message, others said I should chase the prestige, but I preferred Cal anyways (go bears!) and silenced the doubters.\n\nAs I write this: my manifesto, I have not yet sent my rejection letter to Stanford, but by the time I publish this, [unless they accept my terms,](https://imgur.com/a/vm2HzkU) I will have committed to Cal (the better school). \n\nTLDR: I didn\u2019t want my mascot to be [a fucking tree.](https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/sjm-stantree-1022-06.jpg?w=442)\n\n\n(All the hyperbole in this post aside it was a thought-out decision that I spent months going through with my immediate family and counselors. For 98% of people, Stanford is probably a better fit, for my very unique situation and needs, Cal is a better fit. Don't worry in the comments, I'm only a little insane.)",

I'm pursuing chem e at CoC and was worried about this whole prestige factor that distinguishes Berkeley from other private schools like Stanford and Princeton even tho Berkeley trumps most private schools for stem except MIT and Stanford. I wanted to know if job opportunities at Berkeley   are the same as Stanford. Also, Stanford and HYPSM take a great deal of pride in their alumni network. You're the first person who has said that Berkeley has a wide alum network. Idk about wide but in what ways does an alum network help a student. Having said that, does Berkeley's network align with those of an ideal network? Would really appreciate the help. In a pickle between choosing Princeton and Berkeley.",

Princeton doesnt have 20 elements on the periodic table + the amazing chem faculty we do.\n\nif you have talked to current ChemE students that you are close with and they say that they think it's hard to succeed **for you** and if you personally prefer to have your hand held then Princeton is the better option. idk about princeton's program for chem (a quick google search says it's chem program is ranked #135) but youd definitely have more 1-on-1 support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTbh though u got into berkeley and princeton so i think youd be fine here academically, people overhype the difficulty and blame that on their own lack of studying a lot lol.\n\nJob opportunities at Berkeley are great, i don't think i need to say the obvious but all the data is publicly online, u can see where berkeley chem grads go with a google search",

Virtually everyone changes majors in college, so picking based on 1 program is a risky idea. Stanford is also obviously more prestigious and that carries over for the rest of your life. Not that Cal isnt, but it certainly isnt at Stanfords level. As others have mentioned, the yield rate is trivial and irrelevant and not a great reason to turn down such an opportunity. Lastly, you hate Stanford bc its elitist? That is never going to change if people like you refuse to go there and I think youd be surprised at how many kids are not from super rich families. \n\nAnyways, the decision is yours and you will prob be fine going to cal...its just a very big decision",

Even what you wrote in your essay is evident of that. I've seen so many other underrepresented applicants say the same thing, how they'd get rejected from the Ivies, but Stanford gave them the surprise acceptance. I'm not saying it doesn't favor the wealthy and privileged, of course, but I've heard enough about it to believe that it may be doing that less than the other top schools. It doesn't even have the huge endowment of the older universities, and yet in the case of US students it's \\*unbelievable\\* how much financial aid they receive if they're of low, even middle class income.\n\nMakes me even more sorry for not applying there.

Yea, someone smart enough to get into Stanford is dumb enough to not realise that Stanford is not gonna care one bit about turning them down and that Stanford accepts 2k+ students, of which 18% reject the school, meaning that OP would have a 0.04% effect on their yield rate, LOL! Except even then, it will have 0% effect because Stanford only reports 2 to 3 sig figs. So if the rate is 82.1%, it will still be 82.1%.\n\nYea bro, I bet most kids who end up dropping out of HS have more wisdom and emotional stability than wasting a month crafting the perfect app to a university they were going to reject instead of focusing on other apps, doing school work, relaxing, etc. OP literally said Stanford is a snobby and then proceeds to waste his time applying to Stanford only to act like a snob to them. Then OP says Stanford is an elite university and finds out he got a full ride. Hello irony.\n\nSorry, but the verdict is that this post is insanely fake. One of the fakest A2C posts in history that so many for. I thought it was blatant satire because of the paragraph above, but then OP's tone became serious at the end with the bracketed text, so now it's just fake. I am so disappointed in thia community for falling for this. Sorted by controversial and still couldn't find people questioning this. This might be some weird fetish post by someone who got into Berkeley assuming that part is real. Or maybe it is really good satire.",

            "comment": "I can't speak for everyone, but it's probably a mindset thing. My friends who had senioritis used 2nd semester of senior year as more time to recharge before college started so they could minimize the risk of burning out when things got tough. All of them ended up doing great first semester (&gt;3.7 in STEM majors). \n\nI can easily see things going sideways if you underestimate the difficulty of college or if you decide to keep slacking off even after first semester has started. But in general study habits don't just evaporate in the span of a few months",

    "postText": "Hey y'all.\n\nI am going to be a freshman in college next fall and I am just wondering if I have made a mistake.\n\nI got into Georgia Tech for computer science and I ended up choosing to go here. However, my family and I have to pay out of state tuition which is close to $50000 per year.\n\nI also applied to ERAU Daytona for computer science. It is definitely a lesser known school. They cut my tuition in half where we would have to pay about $20000 per year (they gave me quite a bit of money).\n\nDid I make a mistake? Part of me thinks not because GA Tech is amazing for computer science and it is known to provide many opportunities. Also, people have said that the amount of money is worth it for GA Tech since it is such great quality. However, I have heard people tell me that there is no \"bad\" computer science program. \n\nI am asking this question because I may be able to transfer the following year to ERAU Daytona and have the same scholarship money.\n\nThank you!",

Their graduation rate is like 40% because people who go without realizing that drop out (this can be an indicative of a lack of support  at the school if students can\u2019t graduate.) \n\nSocially, do you think you would enjoy it at ERAU? The have a 75/25 male to female ratio and their school is a majority white. They are also in Daytona in Florida compared to Atlanta, so the city vibes and maybe political climate are much different if that matters to you.",

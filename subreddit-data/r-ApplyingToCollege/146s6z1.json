            "comment": "To be precise, with unhooked applicants the most selective private US colleges want all of very good academic scores, very good ECs, and very good \"personal\" indicators.  They basically need to apply all three of these filters because they get so many applications, and are also mostly on the small side by international standards. \n\nThe most selective Canadian universities are more like US public universities in size.  They are also generally much more academic focused in admissions (even more so than comparable US public universities), although I gather UBC in particular might be a little more like a US public university in that it gets enough applications it needs to use ECs for some filtering.\n\nMy understanding is Australia is pretty close to the UK system, where they are going to evaluate your academic credentials for a specific course.  With US applicants, they will have GPA and test requirements, and usually the test requirements for a course can be satisfied with some combination of APs (likely including some required APs for your course), and you might be able to reduce the AP list with a sufficiently high SAT/ACT score.",

            "comment": "At the undergraduate level, Canadian universities often don't even ask about extracurricular activities. You send in your transcript and you wait. \n\nCanadian universities are very different in their approach to education than American ones. Our top universities-- University of Toronto, McGill, UBC, etc.-- each have in excess of 40,000 students. You'll get an excellent education at any of them, but we don't have a culture of the super-prestigious uni opening the world, blahblah, at least not to the extent of our American counterparts.\n\nI attended McGill University (which was the top uni at the time-- it's dropped a bit since.) Got a scholarship, etc. **I didn't even have to submit an essay.**  They had no idea about anything except for my grades.",

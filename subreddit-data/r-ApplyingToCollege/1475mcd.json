    "postText": "1 Semester of a dual enrollment class is equivalent to one year of spanish in my school system. I know most top colleges want at least 3 years of foreign language but I've already done spanish 1 dual enrollment and want to continue that route \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05. This means I would do the equivalent of spanish 3 just in dual enrollment format. Note: I want to be a STEM major... specifically engineering.",

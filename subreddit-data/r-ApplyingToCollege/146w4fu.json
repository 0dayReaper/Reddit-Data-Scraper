    "postText": "Fuck grades. I fucking hate how people look at grades as a way to measure intelligence when reality it\u2019s just a measurement of how much someone stares at a book. I also fucking hate the feeling of losing grades. I hate the school system, I hate universities and how they exploit students. I hate that education is not free. I hate mfs who look at mfs differently if they had lower/higher grades. I hate how a performance on a paper can determine basically your future. I reaallyy really hate elitists. I hate how the quality of education is not the top priority for universities anymore. I hate degrees.\n\nEdit: Read my reply before judging.",

This, in turn, results in great minds, talents, and potential being wasted and underutilized in the world.\n\nYou can see this everywhere too. If you have a good eye, you can see talent and skill in all people. The problem is that school never taught these people the value of their talents or even nurtured them, which I think is what schools should be all about\u2014a place where skills are found and nurtured.\n\nI 100% understand that much of my rant doesn't make sense or can seem like I was just rambling off bullshit\u2014well, because I kind of was.

It'll be all right. \n\nAn important thing to learn as you grow up, something most people don't ever learn, is that your arguments fail as soon as you start lying or exaggerating. The only arguments that succeed for long (Trump supporters being the exception since they'll believe anything) are the ones which are true. \n\nSaying grades are a \"mere measurement of how much someone STARES AT A BOOK\" is just idiotic. If other people earn better grades than you, and apparently they do, it's not because they're \"staring\". It's because they're \"learning\" better than you. Maybe work on that more instead of attacking hard-working students who make sense out of the subjects they're taking. \n\nI also worked hard and didn't have great success. Right through high school and well into college, my massive amount of work (up well past midnight each night, studying all afternoon Saturday and Sunday while other people were relaxing, and so on . . .) did not pay off. I got B's, C's, and a few D's\n\nThe problem was that I wasn't studying correctly. I was highlighting everything, taking notes on everything, and not learning anything particularly well. Not until I started to be more selective (meaning \"smarter\") did I start to do much better, getting A's in my Senior year in college and all A's in grad school. \n\nYou just need to learn how to be a good student instead of ranting about how unfair everything is. Also, lots of mediocre students have become great successes in life. FDR (look him up since you probably  don't know who he is) was a \"C\" student. JFK (ditto) had miserable high school grades. The only reason Harvard admitted him was his father's prestige, power, and wealth. And so on . . . .\n\nNone of this is about \"elitists\" which is the trendy word of the moment that you've adopted (of course since you apparently can't think for yourself). Someone who is smarter and more hard-working than you are is not an \"elite\". They're a better student than you are. \n\nAnd, yes, a \"performance on a paper\" does matter since it shows how well someone thinks, how logical they are, and how convincing they are. It also shows how hard they worked and how much time they spent on the assignment by not doing it half-assed at the last mintue. It's one of the main ways we decide who gets A's and who gets C's and D's. And I know what you get. You didn't write \"I'm working hard but getting low grades, so what can I do to change it?\" That would have been a mature question. \n\nAnd I have absolutely no idea what you mean when you say \"the quality of education is not the top priority for universities anymore\"? Where in the world did you come up with that one? And if you \"hate degrees,\" your'e free to go through life without a degree. I hear there are a lot of good plumbing jobs available.

I got my undergrad in 2010 and it was rough going at first because I didn't get internships when I was in school and so I had no leads and no networking in place.\n\nAn internship can be an excellent opening since you become *way* more valuable for subsequent full-time employment with the company. You're not just trained, you know the job and already understand the context. That means you can hit the ground running rather than spend 3-6 months ramping up.",

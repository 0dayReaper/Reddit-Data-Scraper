I was given a fat scholarship where I only have to pay 400$ instead of like $2380 so kinda considering it. I'm hoping to gain connections with my mentors and try asking them for internship opportunities in the future. I'm also a bad writer so I hope to be a better writer out of this. I know paid college programs are ass and it has no boost to your application, but I'm just trying to gain connections and future opportunities (: ",

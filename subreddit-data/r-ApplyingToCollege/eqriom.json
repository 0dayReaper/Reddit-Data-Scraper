    "postText": "I (17 m) had my Yale interview today. The interviewer (25 f) was smoking hot, and we really hit it off. She very clearly liked me and seemed to be giving me \u201cthe look\u201d left right and center. I honestly lost count of the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly 3 hours, and most of our conversation wasn\u2019t even remotely about Yale\u2014just random things about ourselves. Towards the end of the interview, I had a strange urge to go in for a kiss. It\u2019s as though I completely forgot that this was an interview for college, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately shouted \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d as I was about to go in for it. I instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and there. I am really stressed out now about the repercussions of this; I put a lot of work into my Yale application and it would really suck if it gets fucked because of this. Am I screwed?\n\nTL;DR: Tried to kiss my Yale interviewer at the end of our conversation. I massively fucked up.\n\nEdit: I just emailed my interviewer and both thanked her for the conversation and apologized again profusely. Not sure if there\u2019s anything else I can do at this point. \u2639\ufe0f\n\nEdit 2: The fact that people think it\u2019s a shitpost is only making me realize more and more just how much I\u2019ve fucked up...",

You didn't ask this woman out on a date - this was totally inappropriate, and shows lack of judgment. No woman is going to give you a go ahead to be part of Yale and have you act in a predatory manner to other women on campus.

The behavior was honestly fairly predatory.  He deluded himself into thinking this woman was into him from what I'm betting was a fairly normal interview.  \n\nThat kind of self delusion is often found in the kind of predatory creep who can't take no for an answer because he's actually convinced himself you want him.  It's honestly one of the worst types of creep because he's usually a confident and well liked dude.    People will rarely take you seriously when you bring up his creepiness because he's actually very charming.  \n\nI wouldn't call op predatory, at this time, because he really sounds like a dumb kid that's watched to many TV romances.  I think what a lot of people are trying to put their finger on though is why this behavior is kind of disturbing.  I think the self delusion and the risk that op could become a predator if he doesn't correct that mindset is what's giving people pause.",

In his mind she was so into him and wanted him but in reality it was just her being friendly and trying to conduct an interview.\n\nHaving this lack of understanding of consent is really dangerous to have going into college and that's what Yale is going to probably get from this \"little mistake\".",

They would take this very seriously, as an indication of OP's maturity/readiness for college.  Part of your admissions application (which includes the interview) is for them to imagine how you would contribute on campus.  Your lack of good judgment and (quasi?) predatory action demonstrates that you are not ready socially/emotionally/psychologically to interact with peers, teaching assistants, professors, etc.  In this age of #metoo, you really need to evaluate your actions, the meaning of consent and your sense of entitlement.",

You need to seriously rethink how you view women and professional boundaries, otherwise I fear for your future female classmates and coworkers... That shit's not okay.",

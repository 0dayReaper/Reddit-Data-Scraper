Each school's site gives me the option to apply with either CommonApp, or with \"(school'sname)Apply\" (for example, MaineApply or KentuckyApply). I've clicked both links, and the information on them seems very similar- I'm confused. What is the difference between these two options, and which should I select/are there pros and cons to either?",

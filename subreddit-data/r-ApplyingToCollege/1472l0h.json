How would you describe your freshman year overall. If you came for a \"regular\" public school, how was the academic transition? Also how was the social transition from hs to college. Thanks!",

However, from day one, it was a great experience. All the freshman live together in a part of the campus called Commons which really brings the freshman body together and gives you multiple of opportunities to connect with people. Academically, the classes can be challenging, however it\u2019s extremely collaborative and I was able to stay on pace well. Overall, I feel like vandy is not too small or not too large where you can find what is comfortable for you socially and academically.",

    "postText": "i\u2019m from singapore, and we have quite a rigid education system with only 3 standard paths for grades 11 &amp; 12. basically i\u2019m in grade 10 now and taking the singapore cambridge gce o levels this year (not igcse). moving forward, i have 3 choices for grades 11 &amp; 12.\n\n1. i can go to a junior college where we don\u2019t have a gpa and my results are only based on one singular exam at the end of grade 12, the singapore cambridge a levels (again, not gcse). i can take a max of 4 a level subjects at a h2 (higher) level, highest possible grade is A. my internal results throughout hs basically don\u2019t matter in sg, only these final grades count. \n\n2. a polytechnic, where i choose one specific course to study (eg business, biomed, shit like that) and i\u2019m graded with a gpa consistently throughout 3 years (it\u2019s a 3 year program). at the end i get awarded with a diploma, not a baccalaureate, as well as my cumulative gpa, but that gpa is based on only modules i take that is related to my course of study, so it\u2019s narrow in that sense. however polytechnic gives a lot more opportunities to build my portfolio based on that course of study compared to junior college.\n\n3. ib. we can only take 3 HLs and 3 SLs, no more HLs than 3, on top of the ib core and all the typical ib things. also more opportunities to build my portfolio than jc, but not more than poly. \n\ni\u2019m asking for advice on which to choose if i\u2019m aiming for mainly hypsm or ivies, thank you!!!",

IB could be better though, I can\u2019t really comment on that. The polytechnic seems like a bad idea bc us unis have lists of subjects they\u2019d like you to take and how many years they would like for you to take them, and especially applying from Singapore you probably want as much help as you can get",

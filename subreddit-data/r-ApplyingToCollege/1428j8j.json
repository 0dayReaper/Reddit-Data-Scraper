    "postText": "***Before I might get attacked, I should mention that I\u2019m super grateful that my hard work earned recognition and that this may not be relatable to everyone/anyone. \n\nI can\u2019t help but notice that every time I succeed in something/receive some kind of award, I feel happy for the recognition and how this can make me a more competitive applicant with college apps but am left with a kind of empty feeling after like 1 day. It almost feels like it doesn\u2019t even matter. I have a feeling that if I manage to get into a good school, the euphoric feeling will last for like 1 week max. Idk if other people feel like this too but I just had to voice it. Is this normal? \n\nI just personally wished it lasted longer so I can feel like my efforts paid off.",

            "comment": "When people say it is the journey and not the destination, often it is in part a warning based on personal experiences like this.  In retrospect, the most meaningful experiences are often the ones where the long period of sustained effort is itself the thing you end up valuing, not the \"award\" you got at the end.  And you are quite to expect the mere fact of getting into a \"good school\" will not provide a sustained emotional reward.\n\nNow, if you go to a school where you really enjoy the experience, find the classes interesting and challenging, value the relationships you form, have fun in different activities, and so on . . . that can be extremely rewarding.  But that's the journey.\n\nIf you instead approaching being at a \"good school\" as just an opportunity to seek out the \"awards\" that may help you get a \"good job\" or admission to a \"good graduate/professional\" program, or so on, you will likely find the emotional rewards quite fleeting again.  And unfortunately, there are some people who live their whole lives that way.  And while they may accumulate many \"awards\", they are not typically very happy lives.\n\nSo hopefully you can learn from all this some important lessons about what really matters to you.  And to be clear, the lesson is not that sustained effort has no value.  But it has the most value when the sustained effort itself is the source of value, not whatever \"award\" you are granted at the end.",

            "comment": "There are many reasons this could be happening.  \n\nFirst, some find themselves seeking outside validation rather than pursuing goals or pursuits that they find personally rewarding.  For example, I\u2019m an attorney and I know a number of attorneys who got into the field because they thought that becoming a successful lawyer would demonstrate to others that they were smart and successful.  Dad would slap them on the back, grandma would brag, and former classmates would nod knowingly.  And then they began practicing law and soon realized that they don\u2019t actually enjoy their work and the achievement dims. Several of these folks transitioned to teaching high school or opening their own small businesses, however, and are now finding their careers rewarding.  \n\nSecond, achievement can become a compulsion.  Returning again to law, one gets into a good college, earns a strong college GPA and LSAT, gets into a good law school, makes law review, gets chosen for the executive board, gets a clerkship, joins a prestigious firm, works hard to impress clients and partners, and becomes a partner herself.   But you can keep going!  Were you named a top attorney under 40 by American Lawyer? Are you recognized as a top lawyer in your practice area?  Have you argued a case before the Supreme Court? Are you on the short list for a federal judgeship?  Are you on the firm\u2019s management team? There\u2019s always something left to achieve, so if you always covet the next success \u2014 and don\u2019t take pleasure from what you\u2019ve achieved \u2014 you\u2019ll never actually feel successful. \n\nFinally \u2014 and we see this here on A2C year after year \u2014 some try to use achievements to overcome problems like depression, anxiety, introversion, or abuse. They feel that if they get into a dream school or highly selective university, that will make them happy.  But because these problems come from within, the happiness is fleeting.  Attending Michigan, Brown or UCLA offers one an amazing opportunity, but it doesn\u2019t rid one of the depression or social anxiety that gets in the way of enjoying these opportunities. That requires a different kind of work and very often professional guidance. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are more reasons.  But achieving in areas that don\u2019t bring genuine personal fulfillment, addiction to the process of earning achievement, and using achievement to overcome depression or anxiety are three of the most commonplace reasons happiness with a recent success can be fleeting.",

For context, I have a 3.67 UW GPA going into senior year but a 4.34 W GPA from 12 AP classes and a couple extra courses at my local community college. Will the low UW gpa hinder my chances at some selective schools?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m aiming for T50s",

A 3.67UW with a good degree of rigor (as you have) will be viewed more favorably than a 3.67 with fewer advanced courses obviously. How much varies school to school.",

And not as strong as 3.9/12 AP. Beyond those obvious points, it\u2019s an art more than a science\n\nThe type of AP courses, A/B/C\u2019s were earned all matters, as does the rest of the application.\n\nAt the most selective schools, there will be thousands of 3.9+/12 AP applicants, which will make a 3.67 a challenge.  At many \u201cT50\u201d schools, you should be quite competitive.",

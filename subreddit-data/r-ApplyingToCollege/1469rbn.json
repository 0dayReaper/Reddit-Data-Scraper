    "postText": "- Not looking into Privates because of cost. Most Privates have amazing financial aid and can be comparative financially with some in state public schools. \n\n- Most Privates don\u2019t cost more out-of-state\n\n- Apply to most colleges with Early Action if available, for some schools Regular Decision might be better (UVA)\n\n- Get through your essays with at least 2 weeks before the application deadline\n\n- Re-read and check through your entire application. Don\u2019t want your chances to be messed up based on a clerical error \n\n- Look into median SAT/ACT scores for the colleges your applying to. If you are above the 50th-75th percentile, include them and try to not go test-optional when the school your applying to has a significant amount of test-submitted applicants (Look into their post-COVID stats if available)\n\n- Please make your Common App essay interesting and not a sob story or volunteering story (unless its truly significant to your development)\n\n- If you get into your 2nd favorite school and not your 1st, gaslight yourself into thinking you made the right choice\n\n- Apply to some eh schools with great financial aid, see if you get that fullbright",

Some schools also build merit (i.e. non-need-based) into their NPC, but not all of them, and some schools don't even offer non-need-based aid.\n\nIf your family income is fairly modest, then \"$80k minus financial aid\" *may* turn out to be less expensive than what you'd pay at an in-state public school.  The mitigating factor here is that the sort of student who can get into a private school with a financial aid offer so big it reduces the school's net cost below \"full price in-state public\" will often not have to pay full price at their in-state public.",

Automatic means students qualify (or not) based on a fixed set of criteria (which are usually published).  Competitive means it's a holistic evaluation and some students get one and others don't.\n\nTo get a sense of how many (and how much) a school gives, you can check that school's \"common data set\"..  Google \"{school} common data set\" and grab the most current one.  You want section H2.\n\nH2A = # of degree seeking undergrads\n\nH2C = # of degree seeking undergrads found to have financial need\n\nH2N = # of degree seeking undergrads with no financial need who were awarded non-need-based aid (excluding athletic scholarships)\n\nH2O = average amount received by students in H2N\n\nSo then:\n\nH2N / (H2A - H2C) = % of students w/o financial need who got merit aid\n\nH2O = average amount of merit aid per student who received any\n\nWhat those stats don't tell you is the distribution.  If 100 students got aid and the average is $1800 per student, that could mean 99 students got $1k and one student got $81k or it could mean all 100 students got $1800 each.",

In my case a private school I applied to (salem college) would only cost me 6k a year while my top choice state school (app state) would cost 12k per year, private colleges also sometimes have a selective full ride scholarship with a separate application, but in most cases going to a private and getting good financial aid is only fesiable if you're very poor (need based fiancial aid) or get into a very generous and prestigious school (they have higher levels for where you have to pay more, like at some schools if you make 60k a year your paying everything while at others its more or less)",

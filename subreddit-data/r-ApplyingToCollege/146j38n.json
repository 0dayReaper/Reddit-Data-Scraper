    "postText": "hello. 18m here. i did really bad in highschool, covid made it worse but i have extreme adhd and a lot of trouble learning in general. i did bad in highschool but at least ended up graduating which i\u2019m sort of proud of but not really considering i graduated with a 1.8 unweighted GPA. now, my plan all along was to get on medication, get more help for my learning, and be able to go to a community college for 2 years, hopefully be able to turn my GPA around and then transfer to a better college, but almost every community college says you need a 2.0 GPA to enter it. this bothers me so much because i don\u2019t understand how i can ever rank up if i have a 1.8. am i doomed forever? will i forever just be stuck only having low jobs? please. i\u2019m falling into a huge depression from this. i know i did. bad in highschool and i wish i could go back but the past is the past and i can\u2019t now because i already got my diploma. is there anyway i can get out of this? im determined to try, but im not seeing any community colleges by me that say you can have below a 2.0 GPA, but this shocks me because I always heard you just needed your diploma.",

For example De Anza a CC in CA has just this for their [requirements page](https://www.deanza.edu/apply-and-register/apply/admission_requirements.html):         \n&gt; Admission to De Anza College is open to anyone, subject to the residency requirements below, who can show one of the following:    \n&gt;- High school diploma    \n&gt;- High school equivalency certificate (GED)    \n&gt;- Proficiency certificate     \n&gt;- Evidence of being at least 18 and able to benefit from instruction offered by De Anza           \n            \nLooking at my local CC in NY, it says you need a 2.0 GPA to graduate from the CC, but no requirements on enrollment. Maybe you're looking at the wrong page?",

For most community colelges, You need at least a 2.0  IN JUCO CLASSES to graduate with an associates/get financial aid (i believe you'll get a 4.0!), but no GPA to be admitted. If you're comfortable, you can DM me the community college name and I can maybe help you.",

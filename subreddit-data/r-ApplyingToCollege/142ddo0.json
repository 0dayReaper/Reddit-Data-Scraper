            "comment": "You'd have to find someone who went to both of them \"overall\" as opposed to getting a specific degree in a specific program, and then they can compare them for you . . . .  In other words, when trying to draw fine distinctions between the top research universities in the world, \"overall\" rankings would have no practical meaning.\n\nAs a very broad general rule for specific programs--MIT will typically have at least slightly higher ranked graduate programs in STEM fields, Cambridge in arts, humanities, and most social sciences (except notably Economics--MIT is really good at that).  Of course you should actually check for whatever specific program you are interested in.\n\nFor undergraduate purposes, the US and UK systems are too different for really meaningful comparisons.  Among other things, UK programs are much more focused on a specific subject area, more like US graduate programs.  Even at MIT, you will get a much broader undergraduate education, but not likely as deep in your major.\n\nWhich of those approaches will be better for you and your future purposes?  The only plausible answer is \"it depends\".\n\nFinally, obviously both schools are considered in the very top tier of their respective undergraduate systems, but it is worth noting the US system is far larger, and for that matter Oxford and Cambridge would be considered quite large by US private university standards (note they are divided up into constituent colleges, though, and of course each of those is far smaller . . . different systems).\n\nAnyway, as a result of all this, \"Oxbridge\" actually educate a much larger fraction of full-time undergraduates in the UK system than HYPSM educate in the US system.  You need more like all of the \"top\" 15 or so US private research universities (sometimes called \"Ivy Plus\") AND the top few LACs to get to an equivalent fraction of the US system.\n\nSo, long story short, I think college admissions to MIT is a bit harder than undergraduate admissions to Oxbridge.  Whether anyone who matters to you in the future will actually care about that, I don't know.\n\nBut every once in a while I come across someone who seems aware of the fact that admissions to Oxbridge is maybe not quite the same level of achievement as admissions to a place like MIT.  Or, conversely, that admissions to Brown or Amherst or whatever IS the same level of achievement as admissions to Oxbridge.",

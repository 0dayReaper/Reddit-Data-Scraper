Vassar had an opening for a medievalist and they beat out the other 290 applicants, and it was their only tenure-track offer despite being an excellent candidate because the other schools phased out the tenured Middle English position in favor of an adjunct spot that pays worse than one of the school's janitorial jobs when the eminent Chaucerian retired.\n\nOh, and 90% of the faculty would gnaw off their left arms for a job at Brooklyn College where they could have a social life, eat at good restaurants, and be in a population where more than 5% would be dateable because they are neither colleagues nor students.",

I just think in general they are probably less distracted by the trappings of a research U with grad studnts, active research, publishing, etc even if there first choice wasn't teaching UGs in a corn field.  I also think some of those teachers then find good work-life balance and end up liking those roles.    And those LAC jobs are steppings stones for a lot of faculty too.  \n\nAnd those crazy faculty job odds are like that all over.  I live within spitting range of a research U that isn't talked about so much of this board but is urban  and know a lot of faculty, etc.  They get HUNDREDS+ of applications for every faculty position.  It is nuts.  And especially because it is in a city.\n\nThe adjunct vs. tenure track problem is interesting.  My kids dual enrolled at urban community colleges and had excellent teachers.  Some that were teaching adjunct at schools that are $$$$$$ and named on this board regularly.  Pay scales vs. COL in the US are ridiculous.",

Then you go to grad school and realize how false it is. Also, there is the flipside--there are professors who want to be in a small town and have less research obligations, but NYU was the school that needed a Husserl specialist. It's just that unless you're a veteran superstar, you don't have much choice in where you go.\n\nThe adjunct situation is terrible and immoral. But also some of the best schools are doing somewhat similar things, but usually with different titles. Not everyone at Harvard or Princeton is a tenure track professor.",

And you likely will.  Honestly, your best odds for good teaching are at small LACs because those teachers are focused on undergrads and are more likely excited to teach and connect with students.\n\nGo read reviews on rate my professor at any top 20.  You'll find awful to mediocre reviews for plenty of profs teaching.\n\nThe last time I was at Harvard I spoke with someone graduating who was ho hum on the experience because the faculty in his department was stand offish.

It's also financially smart from the university as they can get more value from the person for the same price. Meaning, the university not only gets research from the individual, but a teacher all for the same price and without extra effort. \n\nJust think of a graduate TA. In almost every university, it's required/mandatory for the graduate student to TA for a semester or few. Even if said graduate student has 0 desire in doing so, but they have to. Especially if they want their stipend (equivalent to salary).\n\nLike, in larger, research based universities, there are research based professors and teaching based professors.\n\nTeaching professors have the main goals of teaching and doing research to improve the curriculum (courses, methods of teaching material, etc..) for the students of their respective fields. They don't generally do big, fancy research that gets their university talked about or have attention brought to the university.

I was required by my bosses to talk about the generic stuff - housing and dining, academic structure and class sizes, safety, and the majors/colleges system. A lot of people do want to hear about those, and even if it is your 10th college tour it\u2019s someone else\u2019s first. But I was able to personalize my tour much more when students asked about what they cared about. If I was getting lots of questions from pre-med students, I\u2019d change my route to visit the labs and talk more about getting health internships in our city, for example. Or if someone was asking about sports, I\u2019d tell the story of rushing the field after beating our rival for the first time in 9 years when I was a freshman, and talk about the traditions around the rivalry. At the end of the day, nobody cares when the math building was built. The point of the college tour imo is to learn about the campus culture through the personal experience of the tour guide\n\nHere are some good questions to ask:\nWhere did you find your community on campus? If they say clubs, ask more questions. Which club? How did you find them? What was the process to apply? Etc. \nTell me about your best day of college so far, and your worst day. (I think this is better than asking about their favorite or least fav part of &lt;school&gt;, it\u2019s harder to give a canned answer)\nDo you know anyone in &lt;your major&gt;? What has their college experience been like?\nWhere do you and your friends spend time outside of class?\nWhat was the transition to college like for you? Any advice for younger students? \nWhat part of &lt;school&gt; does your mom worry about the most?\nAre there any rumors about your school that you want to dispel? Any that are totally true?\n\nGood luck and happy touring!",

Are you similar to them or not? At some schools, you'll just get a \"these are my people\" feeling.\n\nPre-admissions tours are a lot different than admitted students tours. It may be more about how you are viewing things than what the tour guide does/says. For pre-admissions, just get a feel for the type of school (big state, small/mid private, LAC) and environment (urban, suburban, rural) to see what you like. Which one of each type you visit almost doesn't matter that much.\n\nSometimes the tour guide's actions can tell you a lot about a place. We toured a big, high rep, state school in the southeast, and the tour guide was outright racist towards some of the people on the tour. Crossed that school off the list real quick. At a LAC, the tour guide told us that the only reason she picked that school was they gave her the most money. Makes sense, but not a ringing endorsement.",

It\u2019s easy to rely on a script if you\u2019re just damn exhausted. Plus, a lot of big, successful research universities sound the same because well, a lot of them generally are. Good colleges are good colleges for a reason. They learn from each other. \n\nI recommend just looking at what actual students look like and READING FLYERS! I recommend this last one so much because then you see the kinda stuff that happens day to day. Also ask questions, try to get one on one with your guide. If your guide is good, they will actually tell you some stories about campus life and classes and such.",

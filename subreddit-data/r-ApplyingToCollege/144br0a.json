    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI'm currently a junior/rising senior revising my college list &amp; plan for applications, but I have a lot of doubts/concerns. Recently I've been contemplating switching my intended major and overall career plan that I've had for over 4 years.... currently, my intended major is aerospace engineering, but debating switching to anthropology/archaeology or pre law track (yes that might sound crazy but please read my reasoning...)\n\nThis year I took 6 APs: AP Calc BC, AP Physics C: Mechanics and E&amp;M, AP Lang, APUSH, AP Capstone Seminar.\n\nStill a week left in school, but likely ending with a C+ or B- in Calc, B or B+ in Physics C, and A in the other 3. \n\nLast year, I got a B in AP Physics 1 and B+ in Precalc HN due to some circumstances and unfortunate burnout at end of year (school gradebook style kinda sucks, but not an excuse). \n\nAs a result, my estimated UW gpa is going to be pretty low, and my lowest grades are in STEM classes geared toward my intended major. Hence why I'm contemplating switching to humanities. \n\nI'm really interested in research, but pre law could also be interesting?  Ik anthropology/archaeology is very difficult to survive in/very low job openings, so thats why I was considering law (I genuinely think I would enjoy it as well). Also, I overall enjoy humanities classes a lot, which is why I'm considering that as an alternative. Biggest concern is that nearly all my classes and ECs are STEM related. \n\nHonestly I've just been panicking over this, and would greatly appreciate some advice? Thanks in advance",

            "comment": "So first, the idea you could reasonably plot out your whole career path in middle school was not very realistic anyway.\n\nSecond, competitive law schools don't particularly like pre-law majors, and do tend to like anything unusual . . . as long as it is rigorous, and you get really good grades.  So if you, say, majored in anthropology or archaeology and did really well, that would be a perfectly fine for eventually applying to law school.\n\nThird, anthropology and archaeology are the kinds of fields that largely are not offered at the HS level, they are not AP topics, and so on.  So while you might want to have a good story to tell about why those particular fields are interesting to you, it is likely OK that you have not yet done a lot of formal activities in those areas.\n\nStill, it probably isn't too late to so something over the summer that is connected to that interest.  Which doesn't have to be prestigious, but could be something you point to as demonstrating serious interest.",

Just can't predict the future. \n\nYour second point makes a lot of sense. \n\nMy school offers some related topics, like AP Human Geography and AP Psych. I would have loved to take these, but haven't due to schedule constraints and leaning towards STEM classes originally. Plus, we have latin, which would align with some of my interests in ancient greece/rome, but I didn't take it...\n\nI will look at summer programs. I am currently signed up for two engineering camps but I think anthro/archae. programs would be really cool to look in to. \n\nIs this potential change realistic/possible though?",

Changing your intended major in HS is not something admissions officers are going to think is somehow unrealistic, and again for those specific majors they are not going to have any specific pre-college curriculum in mind as qualifying you for such majors.\n\nIn fact, I just googled up what the Society for American Archaeology says on this subject, and here it is:\n\n\"In high school, it is important to develop your basic skills in math, science, English, and history. Archaeologists need excellent research and writing skills\u2014they write more than they dig! They also apply mathematical and statistical concepts in the field and data analysis. Studying foreign languages can also be helpful, as could gaining skills in programming, chemistry, or physics. Archaeologists also need to be good at communicating with a range of audiences. They share their results with fellow archaeologists and the general public.\"\n\nI won't belabor this, but if you look up similar resources for anthropology, I think you will find similar statements.  These sorts of fields are part science and math, and part reading and writing and communicating orally.  And they are not mentioning specific courses in the field for HS students, because they don't exist.\n\nSo I really wouldn't worry about it being a change from your prior plan, not with these majors.  Like, if you wanted to switch to French and had never studied French, that would be odd.  But for these majors, you have already been following a reasonable curriculum.",

Like, is a future in engineering realistic at this point, or is it better to switch now before college season \\*officially\\* starts?\n\nAlso, what colleges would be good to include on my list, if you know any off the top of your head? For anthro and/or pre law tracks.\n\nThanks, I really appreciate your advice!",

To be very blunt, lots of people are good enough at math and physics to serve a variety of purposes (like being an anthropologist, archaeologist, or attorney), but not good enough to be well-suited for a career which depends very heavily on math and physics.  And obviously that includes many (really most) engineering careers.  And in many cases, you won't know your \"level\" in math/physics until you hit it and start struggling to excel.\n\nAnyway, if your natural skill set is much better suited to anthropology or archaeology, and they really interest you too, I see no reason not to switch intentions at this juncture.  There will be no reward for sticking to something you are simply not as good at doing.\n\nIn terms of college choice, Anthropology is going to be an available major at most competitive non-STEM-focused private or public colleges.  Archaeology may be a separate major, or a minor, or a concentration within anthropology.\n\nCritically, many careers in those fields will require graduate study, and of course so does a legal career, and that next school will be the one that places you in an actual career path.  So, I'd suggest rather than thinking in terms of what college is \"good\" for this field, you should be thinking in terms of what colleges are \"not bad\" in this field, and then where you are otherwise likely to get really good grades.  You can then hope to get admitted to a graduate program or law school where it will really matter.\n\nThat said, if you already have a particular interest in archaeology, you might look at where a college tends to send students for field work (if it doesn't send students for field work anywhere, that is probably violating the \"not bad\" rule for someone specifically interested in archaeology).  I wouldn't violate the \"good grades\" rule just to get access to cooler-sounding field work, but if you are trying to narrow the list between equivalent schools, that would be one way to do it.",

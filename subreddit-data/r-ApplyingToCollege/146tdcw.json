    "postText": "This post really is just me complaining, I\u2019m not going to hide from that fact, but oh well. I like having my feelings out there when I can.\n\nI\u2019ve finished my AS level exams and have started my school exams. The first one I had was math, and while I was convinced that I would do good, since I always understood all the practice questions I\u2019ve done before, but alas, in the actual exam, I cried. I could barely do half of it.\n\nThis always happens. With all my exams. I prepare as best as I can, hope that it\u2019ll go well, but I should know better. It never goes well. No matter what I do. I feel like I\u2019ve tried every single method known to man-kind. Note taking, flash cards, explaining it to other people, practicing questions, so on and so forth. \n\nOf course, who knows. By some miracle, maybe I passed. \nBut even so, it still doesn\u2019t feel deserved. I feel like I *should* work myself to death. Cause it never feels like enough. \n\nEverybody else seems to be so fine with everything. Everything seems so simple for them. Of course, who knows what happens behind closed doors? Maybe I truly don\u2019t work as hard as them. Maybe it really *isn\u2019t* enough.\n\nBut,\nI don\u2019t care about prestige.\nI don\u2019t care about being rich.\nI don\u2019t care about anything like that.\nI just want to be happy.\n\nCan\u2019t even do the major I want without having to go to a top20. But I know I\u2019m not built for it. I\u2019m not one for these tests. I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just not for me, but I have no choice. \n\nI\u2019m just hoping that it\u2019ll work out in the end.\nThat it *will* be enough.",

A levels is actually a hard curriculum (as far as I know from outside), it's ok to struggle. But if you have dreams you should be studying hard, yes. T20 US is so competitive you could be the perfect applicant and not get in. Fixating T20 is not going to give you a relief.  \n\nIsn't that government scholarship encompassing QS 100 or 200 or something globally? You might consider applying to UK, your grades could mean more in UK compared to US. Or Europe? There are **hundreds** of options for you if you primarily want to go somewhere else, not specifically US/UK. And they're more affordable, whether you meet the SA government's scholarship or not (pretty sure many universities in Europe that do meet top 200 or whatever). You can study entirely in English and keep up with local language in the process (for social purposes or if you want to stay after your studies, 3 years is pretty long for this) I can give you a list of good options in EU if you're interested.  \n\nYou should have some safeties. A safety is a place where 1) you can get in 2) you'd thrive. If you don't have safeties and just try T20 you'll just end up stressing.",

If you are breaking down now from all the effort you\u2019re putting in, it\u2019s like trying to shove a square into a circle.

There is no \u201cswitch\u201d that will be pressed to allow you to become good at it and no longer have to put in insane hours.

The low grades were due to an extenuating reason, but those grades still reflect on me. \n\nI\u2019m going to Purdue for engineering in the fall. I believe my extracurriculars and essays, while it may not have made up for my grades, showed admissions the type of student I am.",

I'd spend 20-30% of my time understanding underlying concepts and the remaining 70-80% doing and reviewing practice questions, and that seemed to work really well\n\nAlso, if you went to one of those really competitive high schools where everyone's gunning for STEM, a low B in physics isn't bad. I went to a high school where people would take AP Physics C Mechanics and get a B or C but score an easy 5 on the AP test and an A in college Physics 2 / E&amp;M with maybe 70-80% of the effort. So if your high school fits this description, you'll likely do well as long as you go in with the mindset that good grades won't come easy and work on your study strategies.",

I used to cram-study fairly often in high school but switched to study strategies where I started earlier. The result was that my GPA in college was around 0.1 higher than my high school GPA and situated me within the top 10% of graduating seniors\n\nI know it seems counterintuitive that spreading out your studying over more days is more effective than trying to stuff it all within 2 days, but doing so gives you the time and space to process what you've reviewed and patch big holes in content if you find any. You also don't need to worry about conceptual knowledge fading away if you keep using it because it'll go into your long-term memory and stick around for a longer period of time.\n\nI also think it's less stressful to start studying further out so you have time to deal with any unexpected issues or emergencies that might pop up. It's especially helpful when you have multiple classes with tests in the same week and need to distribute the load to keep life enjoyable",

We are happy with her grades where they are but she continues to push herself with long hours. We have talked to her about finding balance at school as she plays multiple sports - which she loves.  My concern is burnout and helping her to figure out better time management skills to improve the outcome of her efforts.

There are things that just work better for some people than others, and it, unfortunately, did take me some time to figure out what study habits worked best for me.\n\nFor classes like physics and math where you learn through practice, my studying was initially too reading-dominant. I changed to spending 90% of my time doing practice questions, which proved very time efficient. However, I noticed I had holes in my conceptual understanding that would get caught on tests, so I dialed in the reading-practice ratio to (20-30)-(70-80) and found it was the right balance. \n\nFor memorization-heavy classes, I tried a lot of different recall strategies (again responding and adjusting based on how my HW and test scores were) and discovered I remembered more information by doing flashcards that have spaced repetition built in.\n\nI did also have to adjust my priorities. I didn't want to go pro in my sport and wasn't good enough to anyway -- I wanted to do something in STEM. When I got to college, I stopped competing and invested the remainder of my time into school and major-related things. I'm not sure I'd beat 17-year-old me in my sport nowadays, and that's fine with me because that's not what I'm trying to build a career on.",

(keep in mind i have junior standing but i'm a freshman so maybe a few of my bad grades were me adapting to the new system.) \n\nyou won't drop out, but you need to be resilient and have mental fortitude. learn from any/every mistake you make, but also forgive yourself and your outcomes if necessary. focus on self improvement. don't beat yourself up. \n\nand enjoy your college exp. get asm out of it as you can. for me that looks like joining project clubs bc they help hook me up w/ internship opps.",

The engineering professors are pretty clear that you cannot use physics equations from hs in college and you must derive them from either Cartesian or polar derivatives.\n\nI think being able to make friends to study with is the most important part of doing well.",

I received offers from UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, UIUC, Vtech, Purdue, U Wisconsin, and Umass, and I was waitlisted at UMich and U Maryland, all for competitive programs like CS and mechanical engineering.\n\nThe important thing to remember is to showcase your stats effectively. Although I had lower grades in the last semester of grade 11 and 12, I made sure to highlight my grades from grade 9 and 10, as well as the first semester of grade 11.\n\nIn addition to my academic achievements, I had an exceptional background in extracurricular activities, particularly in various leadership roles related to technology. I highly recommend hiring a top counselor to help you build your profile.\n\nWhen choosing schools, make sure they align with your stats and profile. I even applied to prestigious Ivy League schools, but I only received rejections. However, it was a valuable experience to assess my standing.\n\nCollege admissions is all about smartly presenting yourself, not just being a great student.

I also got into UM, Purdue, and UNC eng. Pm/ comment if you want some more info.",

I wasn't even in the top 10% but I made it over many of my peers who were auto admits. I think that's because after a certain time, I just committed to the ecs I was interested in and did well in them. \n\nThat's why I'm not particularly worried about college as I am interested in most of those classes so I'll defo be putting in more effort than I did in high school.",

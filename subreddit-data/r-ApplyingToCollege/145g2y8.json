    "postText": "So I'll probably write about, as my main idea, how moving around a lot as a kid throughout elementary and middle school impacted how I made friends, adapted, stuff like that. I also plan on transitioning to Covid, and how that further impacted me and my high school career (this is a maybe). That's about it. I don't really have a unique idea in that sense, so other idea help would be appreciated. Ik that how I will write it is the biggest factor, but just want some opinions on my essay idea.",

It\u2019s not about what you write about, it\u2019s about how you write about something that showcases your qualities and characteristics. You can literally talk about brushing your teeth if you can write it in such a way that highlights you as a person.",

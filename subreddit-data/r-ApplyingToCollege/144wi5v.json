    "postText": "This summer, mainly for 'fun' and for something to do, i am planning on writing a research paper around a pretty niche jewish studies topic. when i brought this up to my history teacher who i am pretty close with (4 classes over the course of 2 years, both of my APs this year I had her) she recomended  i enter it into NHD for the 2024 cycle. We did the project in class this year and it was optional submission, but i was not happy with how my paper ended up and didnt feel like revising it so i didnt enter. my research area fits in pretty well with the theme for 2024 which is always good.\n\nthat being said, i did some of my own research, and found this site(?) slash journal(?) called The Concord Review: [https://www.tcr.org](https://www.tcr.org/), it looks like it would be a great place to publish my writing, but I am not sure if it is a scam/one of the programs that gets high schoolers 'published' for the sake of helping them get into ivies/t20s (if you dont know what i mean, i recomend reading this: [https://www.propublica.org/article/college-high-school-research-peer-review-publications](https://www.propublica.org/article/college-high-school-research-peer-review-publications))\n\nthe other thing to consider is the length, and this is why i am struggling on just submitting to both. NHD is capped at 2000 words while the concord review is 5000+. in addition, NHD is primarily MLA while concord if Chicago - not a big deal but it will be time consuming. \n\ni also want to make clear i am not just doing a 'passion project' for the sake of college. I have been wanting to do research on this topic since 6/7th grade and only now feel confident in my writing and  research skills to do so. yes, it would be great if i win NHD or get published in some journal/paper but that isnt  the priorty. \n\nalso has anyone submitted to to the concord review or know anything about it?",

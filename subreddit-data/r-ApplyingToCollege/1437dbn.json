The second option sounds as if it might run the risk of spending too much time recounting information that\u2019s already listed on your common app, while the third is not likely to have much bearing on whether you\u2019ll be an active and enthusiastic member of the campus community (I was really, really good at math when I was little). \n\nBut, you know, I think it\u2019s really difficult to tell how an essay is going to turn out from a one-line summary.  The fact is that you could write any of these three in a way that (I) makes them compelling, funny or interesting; (II) reflects some of your best qualities; and (III) leaves the reader with the impression that you\u2019d be an active and enthusiastic member of their campus community. \n\nMy kids wrote a couple of essays that earned them comments on a likely letter and a \u201cyou were the guy who wrote about\u2026!\u201d comment at an admitted student day.  But if I summarized them here I doubt anyone would think \u201cwhat a great essay topic!\u201d  So much is in the execution.  If you have a favorite, consider writing an unpolished version and get an impression from a trusted reader.",

We really need to admit this applicant because they are _______________.\u201d\n\nFocus on how your essay will give them a clear, concise, and genuinely compelling reason to want to admit you\u2026 over other applicants.\n- The net takeaway here needs to be no more than a few words\n- It needs to be a rationale that an AO would realistically find compelling; put yourself in THEIR shoes, not yours, when thinking about this.\n\nPS \u2014 listen to the \u201cInside the Yale Admissions Office\u201d podcast episodes on essay writing; as entertaining as they are informative. (And not just applicable to Yale.)",

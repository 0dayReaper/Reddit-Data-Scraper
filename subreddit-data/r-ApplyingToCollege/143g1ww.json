    "postText": "This club didn't exist so I talked with all of the related teachers and cooperated with the principle to find a teacher mentor and a space for the club. After a while, the principal found a teacher. I wasn't notified on it yet, but said the teacher notified their classroom(I'm not in their class). Some guy in the class heard and decided to name himself founder &amp; president. I met with them, explained my story, and showed the email's but they refused to give me that position. They changed the main point of the club and it's goals so I just left. Their friend even told me they didn't care about the club, just the credit.\n\nWould it be detrimental to put that I still worked to found the club on my application.\n\n(Not mentioning club name cause they might be on this sub)\n\nEdit: Many of the club members believe I deserved it, especially with their contradicting standerdized test scores.",

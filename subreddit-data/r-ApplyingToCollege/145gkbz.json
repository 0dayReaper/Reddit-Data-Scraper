(it gets into more detail but i\u2019m not writing about it on a reddit post lol)\n\njust wanted to know if it seems fine to write about, idk how clique writing about a quote is or if it\u2019s strong thing to write about \ud83d\ude2d it\u2019s a massive part of who i am and what i want to continue to strive to be",

            "comment": "You should write about something important to you. If that\u2019s philosophy, then go for it. But be careful not to talk too much about the works of other people; focus on what makes you you. It\u2019s not a philosophy analysis or a eulogy for Descartes. A lot of people end up writing too much about the accomplishments of other people and not enough about their own qualities and accomplishments. Think about it this way: you essay is a story, and you are the hero; the philosophy that inspired you is merely the call to action. Hope this helps.\n\nTLDR It\u2019s a good topic, but it needs to be done in the right way.",

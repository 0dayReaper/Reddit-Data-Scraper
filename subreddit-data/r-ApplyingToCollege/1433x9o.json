I did geometry when I was a rising freshman and am unsure of if this is considered my freshman or sophomore year (the fill-in sheet only shows those options). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone know if this is considered my freshman or sophomore year? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBonus question: Will colleges view this as freshmen/sophomore or do they see it as being taken when I was a rising freshman?",

I don\u2019t see how Sophomore year is an option.\n\nIf you took it after Freshman year, as a rising Sophomore, it would be Sophomore year.",

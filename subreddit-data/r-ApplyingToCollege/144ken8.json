    "postText": "My AP Calc BC and AP Stats teachers (both junior year) would both let me write my own letters and maybe edit a little here and there but mostly keep it the same. This would give me the chance to create my own narrative and is probably advantageous. However, the general recommendation is one in STEM and one in humanities. However, I am entirely confident that no humanities teacher would give me an above average LOR. If it makes any difference, I likely intend to major in math. Would it be ok to have two math teacher LOR (for the schools that allow it, obviously)?",

The Calc teacher has everyone write their own letters, and idk what he does in terms of editing. The stats teacher doesn\u2019t do many LOR to my knowledge because stats is mostly a senior class. Is there a way to make my LOR more \u201crealistic\u201d? It stands to reason that I need above average LOR if applying to top schools and I don\u2019t think any teacher would give me an above average LOR if they were the ones writing it. Should I ask them to write their own LOR? And if they do it, is the fact that they\u2019re both math teachers going to be terrible? I know it\u2019s not ideal.",

    "postText": "As per my title, do you know when UC Appeal decisions come out? I would assume roughly after/during waitlist time periods but at the same time, I did hear that they would come out 6 - 8 weeks after submitting an appeal.   \n\n\nI know I sound impatient but I was wondering when appeals to schools like LA and Berkeley would come out generally.",

You have to manually go to their applicant portal and check out your status update.\n\nWish you the best of luck!\n\nEDIT: As for UCB appeals, they will send out the decision early June, apparently.",

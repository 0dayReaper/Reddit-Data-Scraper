    "postText": "Hi everyone. My high school's school profile is now posted online and lists several AP classes that have not been offered in their AP form since COVID, including Chemistry, Physics, and US History. I checked with my counselor and confirmed that these classes are no longer offered, and that the only way to obtain this credit is through college courses via dual enrollment, which is how I will take advanced physics and history during spring semester next year (chem is not offered at a viable time).\n\nAs someone who is planning to apply T20, I am concerned that this may lead AOs to believe that I chose not to take the most rigorous courseload possible, particularly for schools like Caltech and MIT, where I would imagine the absence of both AP Physics and Chem while having them listed on the profile would be a negative indicator.\n\nDo colleges check with the AP Course Ledger, or is the school profile the only indication of offered courses for AOs? Should I speak to my school admins about this?",

Hopefully they can help work through this. \n\nI am just concerned because my assigned GC will be new this year because the previous one quit unexpectedly last week, so I really have no idea what to expect.\n\nI know it's super hypothetical to ask this, but in the case that changes to the profile aren't feasible through talking to GCs and principals, is there a course of action to ensure it doesn't get held against me? Can/should I write about it in an additional section?",

And, might I remind you, average high schools (in the eyes of AOs, such as yours) experience an uphill battle for this reason. Colleges in the T20 have so many applications to pour through (and short staffing) that make reading a chore. \n\nSpeak with a GC, or whoever published this for their opinion. The GC supplies a profile to MIT and other T20 schools.",

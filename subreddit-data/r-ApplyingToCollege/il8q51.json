Regular Decision deadlines are usually Jan 1, but Early Decision deadlines are usually Nov 1 (as well as Early Action, or EA)\n\nBy applying Early Decision (or EA) you are part of a much a more limited pool of applicants and show increased interest in the school, thus giving yourself a more competitive edge to get in than if you apply regular.\n\nYou may get rejected, but you may also get deferred, which is when the AOs decide you\u2019re not quite good enough to be accepted now, but they will review your application later along with all the Regular Decision applications. \n\nHowever, the key difference between EA and ED is that when you apply EA, if you get accepted, you still have until the regular Decision day to make your decision. If you\u2019re accepted ED, that means you\u2019re committed and that\u2019s the school you\u2019re going to.\n\nAt least, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s how everything works.

Through that summer after, many of us pre write essays. When most applications open on around August 1, we start the actual process of applying. ED/EA action deadlines are generally in October to November of senior year (most kids are 17-18). Then most RD deadlines are January to February. Then decisions come in through the spring. You\u2019re expected to commit by a certain date (I forget when), but it\u2019s not required.\n\nThis varies a ton though. Some take the SAT early in their junior year or even late sophomore year, and that technically counts as admissions preparation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a lot of people that aren\u2019t aiming for T25s may not even apply ED/EA; they may just wait until RD deadlines, so they might not even start the process until December of their senior year.\n\nBut no, most sophomores (15-16 years old) and freshman (14-15) aren\u2019t even thinking about applying to college. The most preparation we do then is getting good grades. The really gunner sophomores might start to research colleges and admissions, but they\u2019re in the extreme minority.",

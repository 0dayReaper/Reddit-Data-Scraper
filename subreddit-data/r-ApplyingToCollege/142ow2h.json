            "comment": "So basically, the answer is none.  It is none because there just is not enough real information that you can get out of small differences in top standardized test scores (particularly given that these are learnable tests).  So basically, while a low enough score might be disqualifying, otherwise the academic score that these sorts of places give their competitive applicants tends to end up being dominated by other factors, like a holistic evaluation of your transcript in context.\n\nAnd this is why so many have gone test optional, or in some cases test blind.  They wouldn't do that if there was good information in those scores, but there largely isn't.  And I think you should believe it when they tell you to submit a score if you think it will help (particularly if it might help support some explanation as to why your grades might not fully reflect your abilities).  But you should not expect any of them to \"highly value\" test scores in the sense of using small test score differences to determine which of their unhooked competitive candidates to actually admit.",

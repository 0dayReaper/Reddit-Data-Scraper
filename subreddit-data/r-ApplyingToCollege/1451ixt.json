    "postText": "1. My most recent guidance counselor left my school and is no longer working as a high-school counselor, and I will have a newly-employed counselor for next fall. I would assume that this new counselor will likely not gain as close of an understanding of my personality as the past counselor, and they may also not be as great at writing about the academic aspects of my school by the time I begin submitting my applications.\n\nShould I be worried about the counselor letter-of-recommendation? Does this letter have any significant bearing on my admission decision? Should I consider contacting the past counselor regarding the letter, or would that be a bad move?\n\n\n2. My mother works at a lower-tier (for lack of a better term) state university. I read online that college admissions teams will sometimes assume that students whose parents work at a university will choose to go to their parents workplace at a noticeable rate and thus the admissions teams are more reluctant to admit these students to their own universities. Is this true, and, if so, would this apply in my case?\n\n\n\n3. Do teacher LORs from 10th grade have a negative impact? \n\nI think that my 10th grade English teacher has a much better understanding of my real personality and passion as a student than my 11th grade English teacher.\n\nI loved coming to this 10th grade class, and I worked very diligently for the class, always participating in discussions and ensuring high-quality work. This teacher always complimented my work as being exceptional, and even he made comments about how my handwriting and demeanor \"exemplified intelligence\", which has always stuck with me, even though it's kind of silly.\n\nMy 11th grade English teacher, on the other hand, has probably already forgot my name by now. Additionally, he seemed like someone who would not write a very high-quality LOR for any of his students. 11th grade English was the only humanities course I could take this year.\n\nIn this case I would consider the 10th grade teacher the obvious choice. But will eyebrows be raised for AOs whose colleges state that they prefer junior year recs?\n\nSorry if these are all dumb questions (they prob are).",

So you're fine there.\n2. I've never heard of this and I'm highly skeptical that it's true.  Maybe if your mom worked at Harvard, your stats were line with Harvard, and you were applying to much less selective schools, but that's not the case here.  In any case, even if this is true, there's nothing you can do about it, so there's no point in worrying.\n3. Even if 10th grade recs are viewed as less valuable than 11th recs, a strong recommendation is much, much more helpful than a mediocre one.  Go with the teacher who's more likely to write you a strong recommendation.",

I don\u2019t think she can actually write the letter but she can definitely help\n2. 1000% false, that would flat out be discrimination \n3. You can absolutely have 1 10th grade lor, but try to have the other from junior year if possible (just to show your current self)",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a current junior working on my college app, and making my college list.  I am looking to add/get rid of colleges to/from my list. FYI this is copy pasted from another post earlier today i\u2019m just replacing their information with mine.\n\nFor context, I'm planning on applying as a CS major, but may go into finance. I live in Texas and have a very high rank (top 1%). My weighted GPA is 4.58.  My ACT is a 35 (35E 36M 35R 33S) and SAT is 1520 (720 ERW/ 800 Math) EC's are mid. Likely national merit finalist.\n\nCMU\nMIT\nStanford\nUC Berkeley\nGaTech\nPrinceton\nUIUC\nUW\nUT\nUCLA\nUmich\nJHU\nPurdue\nUCSD\nUMD\nUpenn\nUW Madison\nUNC\nUSC\nRice\nUmass amherst\nTAMU\nUTD\nU of Toronto (I\u2019m a canadian citizen)\nWaterloo \n\nI know I have a lot of reaches, so I am looking for some more matches. Still, feel free to recommend good reaches that are good for my major!\n\nThanks guys!",

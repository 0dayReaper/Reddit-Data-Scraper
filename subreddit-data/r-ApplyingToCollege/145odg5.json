The accuracy suffers bit, but you will know to take the results with a grain of salt.  Maybe even use estimates (or a range) for the 2022 numbers to try to get closer.",

Five months into 2023, I would think you\u2019d have a decent estimate of 2022 data.\n\nAnd it\u2019s just a calculator. Use 2021 data. Then figure \u201cwe made 5% more in 2022\u201c And use that. Or 10%. Or whatever you guess. Then update it as numbers change. You \u201ccan\u201c use anything - it\u2019s not any type of submitted data.",

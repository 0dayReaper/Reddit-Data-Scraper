Is it seen as something undergrads do for grad admissions or can it also help for college admissions (for a bachelor's degree)?  \nIf anyone else has become an EMT as a high schooler, please let me know what your experience as an EMT was like and how it impacted your application.",

If you think you\u2019d find it interesting, you could certainly get certified and note it on your application.",

    "postText": "So I was recently admitted to USC as a sophomore transfer and I have been feeling kind of insecure about weather or not I deserved it. I am transferring from a UC school and I have a 4.0 GPA. My mom and dad both went to USC and my mom taught there. I worked really hard in high school and college but I think I am just getting hit with that wave of imposter syndrome.",

There isn't.  So, basically, if a school admits you then you \"deserve\" to be there as much as any other admitted student.",

Colleges are fulfilling their institutional priorities and balancing their books and you fit into their plan for next year.  Don't compare yourself to others.  Take the opportunity in front of you and make the best of it.",

    "postText": "Before junior year I had a 3.7 but it went down to a 3.3 due to stress too many AP\u2019s and too many extracurriculars (also choosing sleep over doing Homework). Do you think I can bring it up to at least a 3.5 maybe 3.6 before college applications in December?\n    \u2022 I\u2019m taking one AP class next year",

It\u2019s easy to calculate what you could bring it up to in one semester based on the number of credits you\u2019re taking senior year. But if you only have one AP your course rigor isn\u2019t going to be great which AOs also factor in.",

    "postText": "Not sure if this is the best place to ask this, but I am just wondering what should I know before enrolling for classes? I got my GED about half a year ago I still remember alot of the algebra i learnt, but my geometry knowledge has gone away mostly. So I am just wondering what subjects should I have a good knowledge of before I enter.  \n\n\nAnd I also ask, if i do not know some of the stuff that they need me to know will they teach me it or will I just be on my own? I'm applying to a community college.",

CCs will often also have you take some sort of math placement exam, the idea being they don't want you to enroll in classes you're not prepared for.\n\nIf you end up in a class where you're lacking some prerequisite knowledge, your instructor may be wiling to help out during their office hours, but ultimately you're on your own.",

    "postText": "Hi, so I am a junior that is starting to look at colleges. I am a NY resident and want to major in comp sci. My parents earn enough to the point where I won\u2019t get financial help, but we also cannot afford expensive/private schools (40k+). I have a 1450 sat and 4.0 gpa, as well as being captain of basketball team, but other than that nothing super impressive. Do any of you have recommendations for good comp sci schools that are not as expensive or give merit? All help is appreciated.",

For example, my brother had a similar academic profile to me (pretty high sat, bunch of aps) and he got merit for university of Delaware which brought the cost down to low 30s all in, which is similar to the cost of stony brook or Binghamton. I just feel like I\u2019m in a tough spot where some of the top state schools are good value but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re a good fit for me, but other schools in the area are just way too expensive.",

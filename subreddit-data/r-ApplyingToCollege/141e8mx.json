    "postText": "I'm an intl student who recently got into both UCLA (pre business econ) and USC (business admin). Both are roughly the same price, but I ended up choosing USC for the better career prospects in my desired field (finance) and west coast connections. However, I can't help but think about what could've been if I chose UCLA. \n\nFactors such as a slight edge in prestige and international recongition alongside marginally lower cost have led me to regret not choosing UCLA. I also had second thoughts from various discussions on this sub regarding the two schools, and USC's generally negative perception here. Where I come from, UCLA is generally recognized more than USC, although I can't be sure about the LA area. However, USC being a private school also has its benefits over UCLA. \n\nHave I made the wrong choice? Any opinions would be greatly appreciated.",

Many people still decided to go to UCLA because of its name, but when they were enrolled, they realize it\u2019s too late for them to go to USC for their better Business Program. ECON is okay compared to some other liberal arts major I guess, but Econ is overly theoretical and you cannot find many jobs unless you have PhD in Econ. Plus the finance clubs are very competitive to get into at UCLA. In USC, since it\u2019s a private school, many resources are more accessible than UCLA.",

There are maybe like 30 people in each batch of the largest clubs so it gives you about a 1/4 chance of making it into MBB. The rest usually recruit into mid tier firms. Obviously, you have to get into the clubs which is a challenge. \n\nThat said, the only reliable feeders from undergrad into consulting are Ivy schools or Ivy adjacent (with the exception of Haas and Ross which are also solid).",

The only way a new club gets more people into MBB is if they poach someone from an existing established club, or someone joins with connections to MBB. \n\nMBB recruiters who recruit at my school have explicitly said that when people apply, the recruiters even know which clubs this person should have been in. McKinsey is the only MBB firm that has some flexibility with incoming class sizes, but for Bain and BCG, their class sizes are extremely rigid which is why it matters which deadline you apply by, and which school + club you\u2019re part of.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say in 5-10 years a new club cant become established enough to get recruiters attention, but a new one popping up does not mean anything by itself. At almost all schools, there is a ranking known in the business community of the best consulting clubs. That knowledge extends over to recruiters as well since when you\u2019re a first or second year analyst/associate, your job is going to be to help with recruiting",

It's given the impression of a school that gamed the rankings and cares more about wealthy donors than its students. Also reputation takes a long time to build and perceptions do not change overnight -- in the 90s USC was frequently called the University of Spoiled Children or the University of Second Choice, so that negative stigma is going to linger. But it has definitely improved its academic standing in the past 30 years and the Trojan alumni network is supposed to be strong on the West Coast.

UCLA is a great school, but its resources have to stretch a lot farther than USC\u2019s do, and this impacts the undergrad experience especially.\n\nThe competition for class spaces is much less stiff. You won\u2019t be crammed into gen Ed courses with 300+ other students. You\u2019ll be actively encouraged to explore a broad range of courses, and it\u2019s super easy to add minors, even from the hypercompetitive film school. \n\nUSC\u2019s fat endowment gives them a lot more space to focus on their undergrads, and to be flexible and encourage students to branch out in ways that UCLA simply can\u2019t afford.",

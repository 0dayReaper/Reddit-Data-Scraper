What you have to do is write an email template (2-3 paragraphs) explaining who you are, why you're qualified to work at a lab, and customize a few sentences to explain why you want to work at that specific lab/with that prof (can mention a paper or just explain how your interests align). So having my high school name definitely helped.\n\nHowever, I was super fortunate and know a family friend who is an MD/PhD, so he introduced me to the PI of the lab where I worked, and I talked to the PI who was impressed and he said just to email him to secure my position. So that's what I did.\n\nMost of the \\~100 kids in my research program though (prob 60-70%) got their positions at really cool labs by cold-emailing, so that technique def works. The PI usually assigned them to a postdoc/grad student to be a mentor. Many of my school's bio research students work at Columbia, Weill-Cornell, MSK, Stony Brook labs whereas the computational kids can do more remote positions. Before I got my position, I cold-emailed and almost landed a position.\n\nResearch is a LOT of commitment, especially if you're in a program and write a paper to submit to competitions (Regeneron STS, ISEF, JSHS etc) like my classmates and I did, so **make sure you are passionate about the lab's work. You should enjoy most of it and care about what you are doing. Do NOT just do it because you think it \"looks good.\"**\n\nYou can chat me if you want to learn more about it!",

Could have continued the scam indefinitely but got married and they wouldn't pay for two tickets (and my spouse had moral qualms I didn't).\n\nAnother good one: \"Executive Vice President\" (you didn't get elected President, but you attend all the Exec Board meetings and do the work the President doesn't, since the President is only there for the title and the pics.)\n\nMake sure you get all the member contact info, since information is power. Another good play is have paid Zoom access and control dissemination of the Zoom meeting info. You have just made yourself indispensable and have dealt yourself into every conversation.\n\nRinse and repeat in college, add to resume.\n\nAnd good luck to you all, junior overlords.",

I think as long as you can create an impact with it (besides \u201craising awareness\u201d), anything you do can make you stand out from a ton of kids who also claim to create a \u201cnonprofit\u201d. Don\u2019t be hesitate to do one of those activities. Just make sure that you are truly passionate about it.",

However, I do not approve of such actions. In my application, I will state my ECs in the least misconstrued manner because I want to be accepted to a school for what I really did. \n\nFor those who try to fake ECs, I will tell you that such extrinsic motivators such as the applying to a school for its \"prestige\" will not bring you happiness. Of course, I am referring to *only* applying to a school for its prestige with little emphasis on other factors. To get far in life, there are many people who use extrinsic motivators such as money and validation to find \"success\" but that really is not success. To find true happiness, you have to have the intrinsic motivation to do the best you can for your own sake.",

Your pianoists, sports stars, social justice people who got in because their spike was in some form of the arts will realize that they cant do things like piano or write poetry down the road so they just switch to the stuff I said above. A lot of people at my school started out as political science majors, but they immedietly switch to CS or Finance before their second year and they are doing fine in life.\n\nA lot of people will not \"fake\" EC. But they will exagerrate and fake passion. Check out that art guy in Stanford. He was interested in art but warped it into \"teaching underprivleged kids art\" in high school but is now graduating college doing something not realted in art. Their goal was to get into a good college - they just picked activities they didnt totally hate and used it to go in - how many people actually like grinding physics problems for USAPO ? Probably none of them but they did it because they were aware colleges love USAPO students because strong physics students are in low numbers",

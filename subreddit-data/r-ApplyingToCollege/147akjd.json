But if you put my writing next to my parents, or a very competent adults, it is obvious that it is different. I approach my writing in a different way, and I think most AOs would be able to see this. I'm only this good because of extensive coaching from my parent who is a writer. For most kids, this isn't the situation, and it would become even more obvious.\n\nAlso, don't use ChatGPT. Pretty fast way to get denied from any half decent colleges.",

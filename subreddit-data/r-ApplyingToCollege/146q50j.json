Don\u2019t go by strict rankings - at their level, pretty much the same and more ever for CS, it is more of what classes you take(even within same college- two guys doing same major will have two different experiences), projects, leetcode, imternships, etc and more importantly location (internships and jobs) matter more.",

That's even more true if you consider the medium-to-long term as opposed to \"right after graduation\".\n\nI'm not intimately familiar with UCSD's Math+CS degree, but I'm guessing it drops some of the CS curriculum in favor of more applied math.  That's fine.  If you're interested in working in software you may wish to choose your electives with that in mind and try and back fill some of that CS material.  Certainly the degree itself being Math+CS (instead of straight CS) won't disqualify you from software jobs.",

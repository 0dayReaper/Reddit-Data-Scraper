    "postText": "I live in the Midwest, but I\u2019m visiting Boston this summer so my family can see a friend. Since my dream is to go to college in New England, we\u2019re taking the opportunity to visit colleges. I have a list of colleges that we are visiting, but I\u2019d like to add some more. So far, \n\n\u2022Umass Amherst \n\n\u2022Northeastern \n\n\u2022Smith \n\n\u2022Wellesley \n\n\u2022Tufts \n\nStill not sure of major, but I think public policy looks interesting. I have great grades and unique extracurriculars, but I recognize some of these are reaches. I\u2019m only a rising junior, but I likely won\u2019t be in this area again before I\u2019d be applying to college, so I\u2019d like a more diverse list to visit. My preference for size is 2000-6000, and I\u2019d like a pretty campus + college town (not in the city). However, like I said, I want to see many types of colleges. Thanks for any help.",

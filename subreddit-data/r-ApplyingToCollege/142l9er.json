    "postText": "So... the data from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/141noga/reranking_the_t20_for_economic_diversity/) uses outdated data that is repurposed \"new\". WashU was quoted in this initial paragraph, signifying an extreme level of undergraduate economic equality. If you click on [this](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/washington-university-in-st-louis) article, you will see an additional link to a  \"new study\" from 2017...this data is more than 6 years old at this point. I feel it is unfair that the post is locked as it feels like misinformation is being spread. A lot has changed since then -- just because they have essentially the largest private school endowment (disregarding the Ivies) does not signify anything about their commitment to financial aid and less privileged students in recent years.",

Brown is also not looking great.",

If you\u2019re going to cite WashU\u2019s co 2026 number then you should dig up its peers\u2019 co 2026 numbers for comparison.",

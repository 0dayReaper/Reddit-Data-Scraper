I plan to major in Econn/finance, and wanted some advice of who I could cold email or reach out to. \n\nI\u2019ve been considering congress members, since that sort of relates to economics. Let me know please.",

Both demonstrate positive character traits (conscientious, hardworking, community-oriented) and help one practice and demonstrate soft skills like customer relations and teamwork.  While an economics internship might have been interesting, do know that most colleges do not admit  by major.  Typically one indicates a first-choice major on the CA that is merely used to get a broad sense of the student\u2019s interests (social sciences, STEM, fine arts, business, etc.) for class-building purposes. At these colleges, one typically doesn\u2019t get formally admitted into one\u2019s major until one has completed a handful of prerequisite classes with a minimum GPA.",

It's not that simple... \n\nWhile it's true that Covid-19 and SARs both utilizes the ACE2 receptor to enter the cell, ACE2 plays an important role in regulating heartbeat. So if you inhibit the ACE2, then you would cause the patient's heart to malfunction.\n\nFinding a better test for Corona really is the best thing to do right now.",

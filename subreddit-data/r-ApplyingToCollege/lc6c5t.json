At schools in particular they have scripts they copy-paste so they sometimes end up sounding bot-like,  but it\u2019s sent by a real person so they can respond to your questions. Often they\u2019re working through an app that saves the entire interaction.\n\nIn general, don\u2019t text anything you don\u2019t want read back to you in court, even to a bot.",

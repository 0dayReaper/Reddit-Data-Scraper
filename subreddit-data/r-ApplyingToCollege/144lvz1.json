    "postText": "I was going to take the SAT in August, but then, I saw that starting at the beginning of 2024 it will digital. I've heard the digital one is easier, and I understand it will be standardized and all, but will the scores be inflated compared to paper, putting me at a disadvantage?\n\nAlso, I'm a rising junior, so by the time I apply to colleges, will they see the digital sat as better, rather than both formats as equal, putting less weight on my score?",

The college board will tweak the scores on the new exam so that they have the same distribution as scores from the old exam.\n\nYour best bet is to take both.  Due to changes in the test, it's possible that some students are likely to do better on one than the other.  Prior to taking either of them you don't know whether you're someone who's predisposed to do better on the paper version or someone who's predisposed to do better on the digital version.",

My cousin transferred from RGV to UT (capped) then Cockrell pretty easily and his college GPA wasn\u2019t even that good.

Have had nothing but success and now oversee two large groups of engineers after many years of coding. Originally in e-commerce space and last 20 years in fintech. I haven\u2019t seen anything among the 200 candidates I have interviewed over the years as part of hiring that made me think a CS major from an Ivy was any better than a CS major from say Indiana U. \n\nAlso, make sure the CS program uses a core language like C++ or Java for its core concepts. Avoid schools that use python for their core, as those programs tend to produce students who know packages and libraries more so than hardcore CS concepts under the hood.",

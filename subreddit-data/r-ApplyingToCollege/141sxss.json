If so, you are an auto-admit. \n- are you a Texas resident but not in the top 10%? Or OOS? If so, then yes, ECs do matter, especially if you\u2019re in the middle range/below the range of test scores/academics. \n\nSpecial exception for engineering: \n- this is going to be a holistic review so your ECs and essays do matter here.",

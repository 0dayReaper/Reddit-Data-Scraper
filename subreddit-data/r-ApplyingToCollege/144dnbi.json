    "postText": "I plan to apply to Umich LSA for computer science. According to LSA, four years of foreign language is highly encouraged. The problem is since I\u2019m an officer I have to take a leadership class and since computer science is selective I\u2019m not sure if having one less math/science class would look worse. I\u2019m also worried it won\u2019t be enough rigor.\n\nTo also give some context. Most competitive ppl from my school are taking 5-6 aps. \n\nSchedule if I take foreign language:\nAp Calculus BC\nAp Capstone Seminar\nAp Physics 1\nAp Biology/Ap stats\nArabic 4\nLeadership\n\nSchedule if I don\u2019t take foreign language:\nAp Calculus BC\nAp Capstone Seminar\nAp Physics 1\nAp Biology\nAp Stats\nLeadership",

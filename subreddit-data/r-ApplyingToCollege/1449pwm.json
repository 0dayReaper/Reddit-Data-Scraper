    "postText": "Hi Everyone!  \nI'm at a crossroads with a big decision and I'm hoping to get some insight from this community. I've been accepted to both NYU Tisch and Brown University, with the goal to carve out a career in the marketing and operations side of a film studio.   \n\\- At NYU, I'd have a chance to earn a joint degree in Film Production from the Tisch School of Arts and Business from the Stern School of Business. This program seems tailored to my interest in arts and business, with courses specifically on the economics, marketing, and distribution of the entertainment industry.\n\n\\- On the other hand, Brown offers a renowned liberal arts program where I could explore concentrations in economics and media, or cross register at RISD. Although being an Ivy League school, Brown could open doors across various industries, I have some doubts about its specific influence in the entertainment field. I'm not sure it would offer the same opportunities to thrive in the entertainment industry as the NYU's joint degree might.  \nBased on what I've heard, I understood that hands-on experience often carries more weight than the degree itself in the entertainment industry. Thus, the advantage of the Tisch-Stern program, as I perceive it, lies in its potential to facilitate early college internships and subsequently help me forge stronger professional networks. However, I'm curious as to whether attending Brown could potentially put me at a disadvantage when it comes to presenting my resume and navigating the interview process  \nAlso, do you think the Tisch-Stern joint degree offers any long-term advantages apart from aiding in the initial job placement? Are there any hidden benefits I might be overlooking?  \nI appreciate any insights or advice you can share. Thanks in advance!",

Not only do you get to be around excellent students on the more artistic side, but NYC...I know three of my son's friends who chose NYU for Tisch or screen writing over plenty of other big names. Unless another school like Brown has a specific niche you are interested in that NYU does not provide, then that makes it harder. My son is very into theater but also engineering. He ended up at Purdue doing Theater Engineering, a full on engineering degree with a concentration in production, set design, and theme park stuff. Kind of a unique program and nothing really like it anywhere else.",

            "comment": "NYU is the clear winner here. If you want to work in entertainment/media, NYC is the place to be for all the primo internships and networking opportunities. NYU is renowned for its film school and performing arts programs and pumps out Oscar/Emmy/Tony winners like clockwork every year. As an alum you'd have access to their resources and also get to rub elbows with future actors, directors, producers and writers who will all presumably help each other down the road. Also Tisch and Stern are NYU's best schools -- while NYU itself is  ranked as a T25, those two specific schools probably rank closer to a T10, with smaller and more selective student bodies -- and you're going to be getting a degree from both? I'm not sure why you're even considering Brown other than it being an Ivy. When it comes to your interests, NYU clearly surpasses Brown by every metric. And you're right about the entertainment industry weighing hands on experience more heavily when you're out of school; in New York, with the right time management, you'll be able to juggle classes and work so by the time you graduate there will be 4 years worth of actual industry experience under your belt. You won't get that at Providence.",

            "comment": " NYU. My goal is to also work in the entertainment industry. It\u2019s my passion - management, audio production, music performance, talent agency, music &amp; entertainment law, film \u2014 all of it. Your location really matters. As someone who was from a city in Massachusetts near Providence, I know that Providence will not give you the materials or resources to really succeed in this field. The ivy name doesn\u2019t have much worth when it comes to the entertainment industry as your connections matter far more.\n\nI will be attending American University even though I got into multiple T29-T50s because it\u2019s the best for my major, expectations, and goals. I hope to venture into music and entertainment law &amp; talent management, so be in a program that allows me to have a great focus on entertainment law, content management, a holistic learning in business, business law, music publishing and copyright + the opportunity to specialize in what i\u2019ve stated above is huge. It\u2019s a specialized program so not many students are overwhelming admission to it. DC is a great location for me to make political and non-political connections to help me strive in my goals. \n\nMake sure you\u2019re choosing NYU if you hands down know with your heart that entertainment is what you want to do. It\u2019s a risky field, but if it\u2019s your passion you will always find a way. \n\nIf you\u2019re indecisive and feel as there are other fields you may choose, I would go with Brown because it\u2019ll help you out in other fields.",

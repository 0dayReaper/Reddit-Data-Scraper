    "postText": "Sorry for my english beforehand.\r  \n\r  \nI'll be 20 years old soon,failed my exams the last two years but I am studying and i'm about to get into uni in October.\r  \n\r  \nI'm scared ,so scared..I am not sure I'm ready yet.I am not an average 20 years old I'm way behind people my age.I don't know how to do anything,never owned a phone ,never took a bus alone ,never ordered a sandwich myself,never went out on my foot alone even to the street around my house.a small trip anywhere makes me nervous so i avoid it and almost missed several important appointments   because of that.I have been at home the last two years without going out anywhere.I am afraid uni would be a disaster, which could be the case for anyone but I feel it's different for me cuz I am afraid I am not good at being in an unfamiliar situation.\r  \n\r  \nEven though I went to school everyday i never adjusted,I kept avoiding everything,refrained from participating in any activity . Uni can't be like this and I think I can't get away with doing so.School experience was not my fav and i struggle socially, I'm afraid it's gonna be the same .\r  \n\r  \nI am stuck and feel I'm a loser atm,can't share this with anyone in real life.I hate being judged because of it.I know it's ok and I can for sure improve,People start somewhere. I'm tryna learn things bit by bit,people in reddit are so welcoming and they explain things to me .\r  \n\r  \nI wish I have more time to build a little more confidence before getting into uni ,but i already failed two years my father was not happy with me ,It's not possible to defer my first simister of the first year, the only option is to never apply,which could make him even more angry at me .I heard there're peope who take a gap year to figure things out i'm not sure if it's the right thing or if I'm running away\r  \n\r  \n",

These problems will follow you to university. Honestly, university might not be the best place for you until you can gain some more life experience and start to improve your mental health. \n\nSounds like you're a non-US student, so I'm unsure of what your university entrance system is like. Not sure whether a gap year is possible/common.",

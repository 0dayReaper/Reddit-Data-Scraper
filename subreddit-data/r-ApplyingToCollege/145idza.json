Or should I live slightly more stress free and just be the best at regular classes (going to be pre-med if it means anything). What are the exact benefits that honors may have over regular and, besides more stressful, are there downsides?",

Some require additional coursework or honors sections of normal courses; others don't.  Some allow you to live in an honors residence hall.  Most come with special advising and opportunities to hobnob with faculty.  Some come with priority registration.  Some involve away-from-campus field trips with other honors students.",

At my school, honors science courses are actually easier than the regular science courses (so it\u2019s not like high school). Also, honors students have an easier time accessing research opportunities. At some schools like mine, you do have to take a certain number of honors classes to grad with honors. The classes are smaller. The listserv will list some opportunities.",

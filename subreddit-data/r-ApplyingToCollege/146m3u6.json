    "postText": "For context I want to go pre-med, I'm a rising Junior.\n\nIt was a lazy day and naturally, I was watching tiktok and came across a post that gave a step by step instructions (with ingredients) on the chemical recipe for estrogen -- now I know I need to conduct deeper research than tiktok, but my question was--is producing homemade estrogen in a state where its semi-legal too risky of a project? I'm super interested in both chemistry and physiology, as well as a deep passion for social justice and would love to distribute gender affirming care in a ever increasingly fascist country. (i'd start distribution with close friends, then friends of friends, so on.--i'd also be able to perfectly quantfy batch numbers etc. for the application)\n\nThoughts?\n\nP.S\n\nI was also wondering what your thoughts on volunteer EMT/EMS accreditation was as an EC.",

Second, if someone.is sickened or injured -- or simply reports you to the authorities out of fear that you might injure or sicken someone -- you are likely going to be visited by the authorities and charged.  Third, if you do injure or sicken someone, your parents could well face a civil lawsuit for damages.  No.  Full stop.  Absolutely not.",

This is a pretty bad idea at the stage of life you're at. If you accidentally injured someone it could be quite the legal issue. I spend more time researching  the skin and skincare chemistry than I do hormones but with the ammount of sunscreen and skincare misinformation out there, I can only begin to imagine how bad it is with hormones. Your passion is there but I think you should pursue something else with that passion.\n\nThe emt ems accreditng stuff is a cool ec I think you should pursue tho :).",

Anyone who would think that this is a good idea, even while in high school, is temperamentally unsuited to caring for others.  This is not semi-legal, but practicing medicine without a license, and is extremely dangerous to the health of the people you would supposedly be trying to help.",

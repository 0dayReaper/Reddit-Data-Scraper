However I just want the fun of learning aerospace, so I might consider double majoring with something I can work with, but definitely aerospace is gonna be my first option!",

Purdue is probably one of the *more* affordable and best aerospace programs but its engineering acceptance rate is ~33% and they don\u2019t give any extra scholarships for int\u2019l. Other smaller cheaper unis with high acceptance rates/more generous for int\u2019l might not offer aerospace as a major. \n\nI\u2019d also be cautious over picking aerospace as an int\u2019l, gonna be hard to swing internships especially in the US just with security clearance and whatnot (especially at a place like NASA or anywhere that works with DoD)",

And yes, a non-US citizen as an AAE Major hopefully has plans with JAXA, ESA, ISRO, Roscosmos, or another homeland agency/company, as US employment is very challenging.",

    "postText": "My projected date for my associates in biology/chem in 2025, and that would mean I'd be at CC for 4 years, and It's concerning me. My college counselor said its fine but my schools counselors are known for being dishonest LOL and seeing people my age graduate already is making me feel behind. I could transfer this year without having my associates and having to continue taking some of the classes I have not taken yet but that would mean I could take some of my upper division courses and apply for my bachelor's earlier. Or I could spend my 4 years at CC and traditionally transfer after my associate's I'm just really lost and in the middle of both ideas ugghh..",

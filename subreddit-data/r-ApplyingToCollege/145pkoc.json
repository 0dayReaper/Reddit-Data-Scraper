    "postText": "I am applying to t20 schools next year, and I want to write my common app essay for the prompt about a topic that you find interesting. I'm thinking about writing about how a watching a movie piqued my interest in science and how it has caused me to enjoy learning, etc. However, I was wondering if this is repetitive because top universities likely can infer that strong applicants 'enjoy learning'. I don't have a sad story, hooks, or any other passionate topics off the top of my head that I could write about. Should I try to find another topic?",

    "postText": "hi everyone. i\u2019m a rising senior, class of 2024, and i\u2019m trying to start generating ideas for common apps. \n\ni have a 4.2gpa, several college credit classes, 29 ACT (ik it sucks, but i\u2019m retaking 2x more and will apply test-optional if necessary), do cheerleading(2yr), mock trial(2yr), daily broadcast(3yr), graphic design, theatre (2yr). i was lead role in the musical last year, have involvement with the school\u2019s advertising board, etc. i go to a private high-school. i want to major in business. \n\nlong story short, my dream school is yale. it\u2019s undoubtedly a reach, but i\u2019d feel like a failure if i don\u2019t at least try my best to get in to any ivy league at that. \n\ni\u2019ve met with my counselor on several occasions and done research on topics to write about for my essays, but i am so lost.\n\ni have hispanic background (my mom\u2019s side) but nothing monumental that i can write about. i never even speak spanish at home.\n\nthe only \u201cunique\u201d quirks i can think of about myself  are how i have always loved to be a google local guide and leave reviews for places (writing), loved to perform and that\u2019s why business/sales is the major for me (can relate to literally all extracurriculars), how i had to mature from a young age? i\u2019ve been technologically literate since i was three years old and taught myself to edit/publish youtube videos, so maybe tie in graphic design or something? love of cars/how i grew up in my grandpa\u2019s autoshop/ worked 3 jobs to buy myself my dream car? these ideas all literally suck and i won\u2019t be able to write an entire essay about them.\n\ni\u2019ve been told colleges don\u2019t want to hear about divorced parents or sports-related injuries that changed your life. \n\ni don\u2019t know what sets me apart from other applicants. i can\u2019t just start writing down things about myself and brainstorming because everything i come up with is clich\u00e9. i\u2019m so lost. \n\ni don\u2019t have a \u201cpassion project\u201d and i haven\u2019t cured cancer. i only have three months to do something and i really don\u2019t want to give up. i\u2019ve been dreaming of yale since my eighth grade year. \n\nif anyone can please give me any sort of insight, no matter how small, i would be eternally grateful. i\u2019m desperate.",

If you actually have a unique perspective then you're fine.\n\nEven if that's not the case, start writing with what you have! No one started their essays with a perfect idea. You need to keep iterating.",

Every school was the same prompt from a slightly different angle and gave me new insight into the story I was trying to tell.\n\nYou just need to START WRITING. Put something down on paper. You're already doing well to start looking at the prompts. Copy and paste to a Google doc and get going!\n\nIt's fine that your first draft isn't great because every school's application is another draft of the same thing and you can just copy paste the new version.",

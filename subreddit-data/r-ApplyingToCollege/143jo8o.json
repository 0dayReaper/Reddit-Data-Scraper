    "postText": "I am hoping to attend a liberal arts school and major in Political Science + Business but don\u2019t know how best to pursue those interests as a junior in high school. I recently reached out to the local mayors office to see if I could help out with their campaign, and am currently waiting to hear back. I was also hoping to intern or shadow for a representative of the state legislature but their summer session wraps up in a few days so I don\u2019t know if that opportunity would still be available. Additionally, I was thinking about wanting to do something along the lines of research but don\u2019t quite know how to go about it. Maybe reach out to a local university professor? Not quite sure. Anyway, any advice or feedback on these plans?",

Getting and keeping a job demonstrates that you are personable, conscientious, hardworking, and have the soft skills needed to assist customers and get along well with co-workers.  Community service helps to show what causes you care about \u2014 education, social services, civil rights, immigration, elder care, national parks \u2014 and often offers high school students more responsibility than some internships where you might well be relegated to taking notes, arranging lunches, and updating the online calendar.  For what it\u2019s worth, my recent college grads majored in political science/government at an in-state T25 and they spent their summers working as paid sports coaches and volunteering at a kids\u2019 day camp.  Just food for thought.",

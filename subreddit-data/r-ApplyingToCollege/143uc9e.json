    "postText": "So I am in a bit of a predicament, recently my father has goten news that we might have to move out of state (TX) to oregon right after my junior year. However, this realy sucks because I am currently doing very well, I am in a STEM academy and am in the top 10% of my class. I fell that after living in both states I perfer texas schools much more. Additionally, in texas they give automated admission to most colleges if you are in the top 10% of your class. So my question is how might this move effect everything, am I screwed or is it no big deal.\n\n*Also sorry for typos if any",

    "postText": "Planning on applying to Penn state, and other various uni such as embry riddle, Arizon state etc. However, having barely passed IB I don't think I should submit my test scores. But my college counselor says I can still say I did IB in my common app and resume but not submit my scores. Should I just not mention I did IB at all? For reference my grade was 24\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80. The only reason I could see the Uni wouldn't care is that I give a justification for my grades because I graduated 2 years early at 16 but I don't think that makes  a difference",

    "postText": "Hey, so I was thankfully able to get into Columbia this spring, and I committed there shortly after. For context, my family is upper middle class. They would be paying all my tuition and fees, and although they are well able to afford it, I suspect that it will still make an impact especially since I have two other siblings who will eventually be going to college.\n\nInitially, I thought that it was the perfect fit. I believed that Columbia would be a place where I would truly be surrounded by other driven and intelligent students, and that it would set me up for a lucrative career in finance, medicine, or law. My parents assured me that they would cover all my college costs, including any future medical or law school costs.\n\nHowever, recently, I have begun to have doubts. Namely, I have seen some posts regarding the isolated and relatively distant nature of the community at Columbia. I've heard about how it is extremely difficult to find high paying jobs right out of college in those fields, and how both medicine and law require much more financial and time commitments. Moreover, although I know that I am capable to succeed academically, I feel an immense pressure with my parents spending so much money to network and make the most of all the extra money they are spending on my education. Most of all, I am fearful of what may happen if I don't succeed and I end up isolated thousands of miles away from my family.\n\nRight now, I have the ability to enroll at my state college. Since I am an international living in the US, I did not qualify for in-state tuition nor did I receive any scholarships. I would be paying around 20-25k/year, which is a much less intimidating price than Columbia's 85k/year. Although I would be letting down all my peers and teachers who believe I will be going to an Ivy, I want to prioritize my family's financial well-being and my ability to go into medicine in the future.",

            "comment": "One thing to consider in comparing your options. The Columbia price tag probably includes housing while the out of state, state school does not. How much are the dorms and meal plan at the state school. It could easily add another $20,000 to your costs depending on the state.",

            "comment": "It is a basic truth that going to the most selective and most expensive college to which you can get admissions is not necessarily the best route to the most competitive law or medical schools.  Often a school where you are comfortably well-qualified and which places its outstanding students in competitive law and medical schools will be as good or better of a bet.\n\nThe biggest issue is grades, and while virtually everyone who gets into the most selective colleges unhooked has an excellent academic record to that point, it is necessarily the case that many of those people will now fail to get the top grades the most competitive professional schools typically require.\n\nSo in many cases if you choose the more expensive school, you are really paying for the experience, not a better professional career.\n\nIt can therefore be perfectly rational to turn down a \"better\" but far more expensive private college in favor of a far less expensive public university option.  Including turning down \"Ivy\" schools like Columbia, or their \"Ivy Plus\" equivalents.  There is truly nothing magical about those schools.  Columbia in particular is a great research university, but you are right to be skeptical that automatically means it is going to provide a great college experience for everyone.  I am sure it will for some, but not others.\n\nAnd if you pay all that extra money and it isn't a great experience for you, then that likely has not been money well spent.\n\nIn the end, most successful people learn to form their own plans for their own reasons and execute on them, regardless of what others may think.  So I would definitely not worry about what peers and teachers and so forth might think.  Whatever you decide, it should be for your own reasons.",

If it meets all your needs, then it may be a very smart decision indeed.\n\nAnd focus on your needs, not on what other people like your teachers or peers will think about it, unless they're pitching in to pay your college expenses.",

It's a great opportunity and I'm sure you can make the best out of it. However... if you feel strongly that your parents will struggle a little bit financially with your next 2 siblings, and feel that you don't really want to go to Columbia... Then I'd say go for the state college. There's arguments for both sides. Make the best choice for yourself, and don't look back on this with regret.",

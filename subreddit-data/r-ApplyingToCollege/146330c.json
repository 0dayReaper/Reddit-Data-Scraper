    "postText": "I'm currently 15 and just finished 9th grade in the Philippines. I've been reading articles and information about financial aids and scholarships to known schools abroad. I really want to get accepted into universities outside of my country but the problem is, I don't know where to start. My priority schools are ivy leagues, though I think I have a slim chance of getting admitted. But, I also look forward to schools in Canada and especially Australia. Can someone please help me where to start? \n\nI have one of the highest GWAs in my school, a consistent honor student, I've won some academic competitions, and I'm pretty active with my extra curriculars.\n\nPs.\nMy financial background is still manageable, but I live off of scholarships atm.\n\nThank you!",

And most have representatives that are willing to chat with you by scheduling appointments. \n\nTop unis in US do offer full need based financial aid but they\u2019re competitive to get into. Thinking of college and strategising your applications from the first year of high school will help you get that edge from other applicants. \n\nKudos to you for starting early! Best of luck &lt;3",

If you want to get a really early start, you could take your SAT a bit early (maybe during 10th grade). Show up to some virtual visits and see colleges and determine what you actually want to go to (not just \"The Ivies\"). Your chances are slim, but you can definitely do this. Everybody can. \n\ngood luck!",

Transferring into a top university is almost impossible for domestic students much less international ones. The aid provided to Transfers can also be less than those applying for first year.",

Some have enough budget but want to attract bright students so they provide scholarships. Some want diversity so they give need-based aid.  \n\ndon't ask these questions to me, google \"&lt;university name&gt; international student scholarships\" and look it up on their websites for the most accurate information",

    "postText": "From JHUs website:\n\"The admitted students have already demonstrated exceptional academic and personal excellence. Among those offered admission is a filmmaker who has been published in\u00a0Discovery\u00a0and\u00a0National Geographic, a developer of an electric car and bamboo bike, a racial justice activist leading campaign initiatives and conducting legislative policy, a researcher on underwater robot archaeology, a founder of a malaria youth intervention program in Ghana, an author of the bestselling book on Amazon in the category of Asian History for Young Adults, and an inventor of an artificial intelligence framework for air quality that has a provisional patent\"\n\nHonestly just wtf. These kids are probably more successful than 99% of adults\n\nEdit: To all of you saying that \"this is not the expectation for all high schools students,\" you know what I mean. Just pointing out how ridiculously competitive admissions are these days and the lengths people go to gain an acceptance. And even though there are many \"more average\" students, why doesn't hopkins tell us about those instead of making us feel insignificant and shattering our confidence with these kids. It's almost as if colleges only brag about these kids that they've had nothing to do with, but where are the success stories of ordinary applicants?",

For example\n\nhttps://www.cleveland.com/seniorstandouts/2012/05/david_boone_persevered_to_go_f.html\n\nThat guy was homeless and still managed to achieve at a level 99% of highschool seniors even those born to more wealth than him will never.\n\nSpeaking for myself personally, I have a very stacked resume. But I grew up in a low income African immigrant household , my parents had 0 connections or even extensive knowledge of the college process. It was unheard of at My highschool to do research or similar. I did work during highschool and to secure my positions would literally send out hundreds of cold emails. I didn\u2019t have a car and was taking college classes at my state school, would have to make up at 5 AM every morning to catch the city bus and go there, getting home after 11 Every night when I finished work. The state Im from had a college credit program where they pay for you to take classes. I maximized those opportunities during the summers too taking 18 credit hours and working a full time job. The process i had to take to get a class like Differential equations on my transcript was a lot more difficult than your average private school kid who\u2019s highschool offers classes like that. And yes I recognize I had certain privileges that not everyone has access to , but it is a fact that there are large numbers of low income students succeeding at very high levels even on par with the rich kids. As an academic institution I think they evaluate your application based on the resources you had available to you and take your background into account.",

Besides COVID ruining everything in general, this means I have to basically self-study the class in order to pass which is so different from another school where their AP Psych teacher might have a masters in psychology.\n\nAnd the growing up! I don't think any of this can be healthy for teenagers growing up, those of us who want to go to these colleges have to basically start thinking about it since 7th grade, taking a heavy courseload and working ourselves to death instead of spending time with family and friends the way we should. We shouldn't have to sacrifice our youths for our futures.",

Slave over bullshit work throughout your teenage years, aka the time of your life where you shouldn\u2019t worry about that, just to slave over more bullshit work in college? And then work 60 hours a week in some job that you may or may not like while rarely seeing your family? Just so that people who enjoyed their time during school can also work hard and see the same level of success? Or so that they can just follow a different path in life that makes them just as happy?\n\nNone of this is actually expected of people our age. Nobody does it except the people who either slave over colleges, have connected parents, or just really enjoy it. I\u2019ve done a good amount in high school and if I get into a T20 I\u2019ll go, but if this is my competition, I\u2019m fine with not getting in. People can be super successful anywhere, and you can define success differently. You also don\u2019t need some fancy, super-high paying job to be happy. You can be just as happy as a teacher as you can be as an investment banker. Might not be as wealthy, but you\u2019ll have more time to spend with the people you love.\n\nidk what this rant was about, I just get so discouraged by what I see some people doing and then worry that I don\u2019t do enough. These people are literally more accomplished in their careers already than most adults will ever be. Almost no one is like this, and it\u2019s not healthy to compare yourself to 0.00001% of people our age.",

Yes I had to be talented to be able to do that but I only got the talent and opportunity because of privilege. I was able to go to a private school during high school that gave me a really good education and allowed me to focus more time on my hobbies like programming and robotics. This was literally only possible because my parents have consistently worked 7 days a week since they immigrated to the US. Very early on in their business they even worked almost 80 hours a week each. How they were able to do that while also being great parents? I don't fucking know and I'm extremely grateful for that, but I know not everyone has that privilege and I do think it really sucks that in this system a lot of your success depends on outside factors. I mean, even the opportunity itself was from the dad of a friend I met at that private high school, which as you can imagine is full of children with wealthy backgrounds.",

He and his friends work much harder and have accomplished more than I had at that age, and I went to an ivy.\n\nKids are already under a tremendous amount of stress in high school, and some of these colleges have ridiculous expectations.\n\nCollege is a time for exploring and starting to figure out what you want to do. And just the start of a decades long journey. Expecting this level of accomplishment and career certainty of kids this age is ludicrous.\n\nYou will all find your place, maybe not the place you thought it would be but everyone on this subreddit will go to college  and many to graduate school and beyond. I know it's tough, but try not to let this process define you. One day it will all be just a blip.

I go to Berkeley, and the distribution of 'what the fuck, are you even human, do you sleep?' to 'how do you put on clothes in the morning, how phat is your dad's wallet?' people is just barely a deviation or two above the general population: it's just a collection of like, 50some thousand people in an academic setting. No school is actually expecting you to have done something extraordinary in high school: you're literally like, barely a person yet. The schools recruit people for a lot of different reasons: they try hard to snag a few ringers like those above for advertisment, some good athletes to keep sport revenues flowing in, a number of wealthy but not really qualified folks to secure funding, and then the rest of us to just like, actually go to college and pursue academic/career goals. The admissions process is largely about securing the above goals to keep the university financially stable, while vetting the other students to see if they'll adapt well enough to the environment of the institution: as a non-prodigy, non-athlete, non-financial admit, your value to the university is bringing in financial aid monies, passing your classes, participating in campus/local culture, and then using those experiences to make the university look good *post* graduation. Why do you think most institutions love transfers, late-entry, military, AP students/dual enrollment students so much? They're people who have, to some extent, shown that they have a motivation for going to the university, have experience in college level material or equivalent time-management experience, and will therefore stand a higher chance of not failing classes, not dropping out, graduating on time, and going on to live a life that makes the university look good.",

It's entirely your fault for aiming for these and placing them on a pedestal when they are entirely unattainable for the vast majority of people.",

I guess some people want to, but imo why would you want to go to those \"good\" colleges? They're snob fests and sound like it would make my life miserable(people constantly berating you, thousands of dollars in student debt etc)",

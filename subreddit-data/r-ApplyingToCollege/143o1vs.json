                    "comment": "Agreed. There's no harm in checking out colleges, but do not build a college list and be set on it yet. When I was a rising sophomore, I thought I knew what I wanted, but now everything has completely changed. \n\nAs a freshman, I wanted to apply to RISD as a design major, and I was extremely dead set on it. Watching day in the life videos, researching dorms, all that good stuff. Then, I decided I wanted a more interdisciplinary environment so I stuck to SAIC. Then, I wanted a more academic, less artsy school so I went to the New School. Then, I chose CMU before I realized that I wouldn't be happy there due to its culture. Then I decided to stick with UMich because it seemed awesome, until the large class sizes scared me away towards Duke. Now, I love Duke with all my heart but I'm open to changing my mind (which I probably will lol). And all that change happened in the span of two years.\n\nMy point is, even if you think you know what you want, you really don't. Take the time to explore colleges, sure, but whatever college list you make now will be useless in a few years since you'll inevitably change your mind. You don't know what your safeties and targets and reaches will be until at least a year or two later, nor will you know what kind of college you really want.\n\nAlso, like other commenters said, you have a really screwed up perception of what targets and safeties are lol.",

Also, very few Ivies are that great for EE (if they even have EE) so you could cut a few of those and save them for law school.  Find the excepted students threads on here and look at the stats of some of the people who didn\u2019t get in to all the schools on your list.  Sometimes it seems totally random\n\nSince you obviously don\u2019t need aid, you should add USC.  Viterbi is really good for Engineering.\n\nGood luck, and I\u2019ll see you in court.",

But even then, court time is incredibly rare and no patent attorney will get any speaking time in court until 20+ years of experience.\n\nSo if you are interested in court appearances, patent attorney is exactly the area of law not to be in.\n\nThat said, it's a great area and well compensated. Plus you have the smartest and the nicest (for the most part) people as your clients. And almost no chance of really screwing up, because almost every deadline is extendable with a fee and almost every mistake is fixable with a petition and a fee. \n\nSome advice:\n\n* The name recognition of your undergrad school matters a lot more than in most other profession. If you go to Caltech or MIT, you'll find it easier to find jobs 30+ years after graduation. So do pay attention to rankings.\n\n* There's not that much emphasis on the specific undergrad major beyond whether you were in chem/live sciences or mech E or EECS/high tech. So pick a major that suits you the best.\n\n* Do take as many classes as you can outside of your major also. E.g. hardcore CS theory classes even if you are not majoring in CS, Chem and Physics classes even if you are in EECS and Chem is not required, etc.  They will come in useful. This is really a profession where every single thing you learn in school, will come in useful.  I used to joke that I've had to use knowledge from every single class I've ever taken, except, perhaps, for Ukrainian language classes. What do you know, last year I had an occasion to use those at work also..\n\n* If there are colleges that will let you get a Masters or MEng degree as well, that will be a bonus, if you can handle the thesis work. \n\n* If you maximize prestige at the undergrad/Masters level, you can worry less about law school prestige and can try to get into a firm that will pay for your law school. This is a huge boon: you get a salary and experience, all the while not having any law school debt. Only applies if you are certain you want to do IP law, of course. \n\n* While IP is prestigious and pays well, because there's a significant barrier to entry, you may be pigeonholed into IP and may have a harder time getting on the General Counsel track, if you decide you want to be a \"real\" lawyer, which IP doesn't feel like at times. \n\n* A good test of whether IP is a good match for you: do you get excited about learning new things and truly understanding them, without actually doing them? Could be things outside of your primary area of expertise/interest. And if you think you can just regurgitate what an inventor tells you without needing to understand it, you will generate crap as output, and it will be obvious.",

That said, having gone through law school apps myself, I\u2019d recommend considering colleges that aren\u2019t known to be especially cutthroat. As another commenter noted, it\u2019s GPA and LSAT above all for law school.\n\nPrinceton, UChicago, and MIT are known for grade deflation, which isn\u2019t great if you\u2019re shooting for top law schools. For instance, the median GPA of SLS enrollees is [3.92](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Std509InfoReport.pdf), while the average GPA at UChicago is rumored to be around [3.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/kbr3l3/average_gpa_at_uchicago/). Especially if you\u2019re a STEM major, you\u2019re likely to face an uphill battle securing a sky-high GPA at somewhere like MIT, while a poli sci student at Brown cops a relatively easy 3.9+. Granted, most MIT grads have no interest in law school (and will crush it in tech/engineering recruitment), but the Brown 4.0 is better poised for success in their law-school applications.",

Substitute UChicago for this point if it helps.\n* Never said OP shouldn\u2019t go to a prestigious undergrad. I went to a grade-inflated Ivy, which helped me get a 3.9+ GPA and probably also helped on the margins with my law-school, job, and clerkship apps.

            "comment": "\"college experience\" is overrated. These are all good schools. For reach schools, try to find leaders/scholars in the field you are interested in and see if you can see yourself interacting with them. For example, learning from Gilbert Strang would have been an excellent motivation for me to apply to MIT. For target and safety schools, think about the cost of attending and realistic outcomes of your degree. To shrink down your list, I'd think about whether you'd really want to attend the school on the list. If not, eliminate, even if the school is a safety school. If you don't get in anywhere, take a year off to travel or get some work experience.",

            "comment": "Purdue is definitely a great choice for EE, but don't consider it a safety. It's a T5 for engineering. Check the past threads of disappointment here for Purdue engineering applicants rejected who thought it was a safety. Michigan, CMU and GT are tough too. If engineering is really your thing for undergrad, these are T10 schools for sure and more competitive than the overall school acceptance rate implies. I hear good things about ASU and probably is a good safety. Same with Boulder. My son had a 4.7 UW 4 .0 W 35 ACT with great ECs with legit leadership positions, volunteering and an internship. He applied to several of your reach schools and got into none of them. He also did not get into CMU. It almost does seems like a lottery system at this point. You can bowl a perfect game and still not even get waitlisted. I am talking engineering though, which is extremely popular and heavily impacted. You could also consider UCSB, UCI, UCSD or Cal Poly SLB if you want west coast. SEC schools have some good engineering programs too and do not to have the same tough acceptance rates. Auburn, Tennessee or Texas AM come to mind. If the end game is patent law, then perhaps the prestige of a T10 engineering school or T20 school in general may not be as important as doing well at the undergrad level and THEN moving somewhere else for law school. Also consider unless your family is poor, you will likely not get assistance (merit or need) from most of the schools in your list. I'd guess ASU or Boulder would give some merit if keep up the same stats. Good luck.",

They will probably be super general (ex: engineering instead of electrical engineering), and try to look at the most popular majors. Try to pick schools with the general field you're interested in as a popular one because the teachers will give more attention to your classes within your major and you're more likely to get a high-quality degree.",

For reference I'm a rising sophomore in EE at UIUC. \n\nFirst off -- remove all of the Ivies (except maybe Cornell, up to you). They don't have good engineering programs, plain and simple. Remove Rice, Vanderbilt, Northwestern, other similar schools. Really, take out everything except for MIT, Cali schools with the understanding that they are EXTREME reaches. It's most likely you will not get in. DO NOT get it in your head to dream about going to these schools as you'll be even more crushed if you don't get in. \n\nMost of your \"targets\" are reaches btw. From what I've seen you're in state for CU Boulder, a great university with a great engineering school. This will be your most likely college. If you want to look at out of state publics, Big 10 schools are good to look into -- Iowa, Ohio State for sure. Others like UIUC, Wisconsin Madison, Michigan, Purdue will be closer to a reach for engineering. \n\nFor safeties, Mines and ASU is a good start. Add a few more, though. Iowa State is great, I'd highly recommend that! Lmk if you have any questions",

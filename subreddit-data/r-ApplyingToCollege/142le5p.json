It has the urban environment u would want and definitely not hot lol. Medium size school that you would definitely get into and u would probably get into the honor college to if u would apply. Take a little time and look at it",

            "comment": "I'm also interested in atmospheric science, and I've culminated a list of schools that I like. Almost all of the top atmospheric science programs are at public state schools, so you won't have any trouble finding a big school (On the flipside, expect the meteorology classes themselves to be quite small). Nathan's comment got most of the good schools, although a lot of those schools with atmospheric science programs are significantly more focused on grad students unfortunately. \n\nBased on your stats and preferences, I think UW Madison would be the perfect school for you. It has very solid funding in atmospheric science, and was actually the [birthplace of satellite meteorology](https://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/). UIUC is another great option, although isn't quite as well funded and reputed as  Madison.  Some other notable meteorology schools are UMD, UCLA/Berkeley, Ohio State, Penn State, U Del, and U Oklahoma. There are some good private schools too like Johns Hopkins, Cornell, and MIT (lol).\n\nIf you're looking for more resources on meteorology programs, the NWS has a [list of accredited colleges](https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/college_lists) (for some reason the link doesn't work anymore but it might still exist somewhere) and the NSF publicized the [amount of funding each atmospheric science program has gotten since 2017](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) (go into data tables and ctrl + f for atmospheric science).",

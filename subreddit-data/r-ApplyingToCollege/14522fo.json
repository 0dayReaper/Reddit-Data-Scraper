I have a friend teaching there and her package was ridiculously good. Good pay = prestige.\n\nSomeone who is really good there is probably excellent, but for people of my generation it still has a reputation of being a school that concentrates more on Greek life than academics. That's probably unfair at this point, but I'm old. So... my thoughts on it probably aren't too accurate / valid.\n\nPS Are there professors who would happily move to Southern California from Princeton? Definitely. (The other direction too.) People on this thread are very concerned about US News rankings. Professors are more concerned with salaries and benefits, teaching loads, location, etc.",

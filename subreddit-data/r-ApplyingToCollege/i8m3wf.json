Both schools will obviously give you a very good education, but I found the Swarthmore kids to be a bit more serious and stoic and I found the Haverford kids to be friendlier. I also see a lot of people say that Swarthmore kids are more competitive while Haverford kids are more focused on self improvement instead of external motivation, but I would say Haverford kids have healthy competition. They also both have really pretty campuses but Swat has more flowers while Haverford has more trees. Between the two, both will obviously take you where you want to go, but Haverford just gave me a friendlier and welcoming vibe. Also, Swat had a huge rape scandal a few years back and I didn't like the idea of a family member looking up my college and seeing a picture of \"Still a Rape Haven\" 6 photos down. It also depends on what you are thinking about maybe majoring in. Do you have any program in mind?",

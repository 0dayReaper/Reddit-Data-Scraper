    "postText": "I won multiple awards this year at ISEF (grand award, multiple special awards) and was wondering if I should list them as separate awards on the honors section. Or should I combine them into one or two awards?\n\nAlso, the special award organizations won't be recognizable, so should I include monetary amounts to show their significance?",

    "postText": "currently a rising senior, wondering if it\u2019s a bad idea to sign up for an internship or job right now.\nit\u2019s almost the middle of june, and im going on a one week vacation in july, and i also have band camp starting in late july and marching season after that (i won\u2019t have that much time during the fall semester with football games and practice). anyway i really want to do something else between all of those weeks in the summer like research or interning or find a job with some kind of flexible hours. \ni\u2019m not sure if i\u2019m behind in the activities area and if an internship or a summer job is what i need, im volunteering at an elementary school\u2019s summer camp for 2 weeks, i\u2019ve babysat one family for 3 years now (just one kid since he was a baby), i\u2019m in various clubs at school and have leadership in 2 of them and i\u2019m in colorguard which is already a big time commitment for me especially during the fall. academically my gpa is pretty good (only got 1 B), and i\u2019m taking 7 total APs.\ni really want to try something new and gain more work or research experience (and also am feeling like i need it) but i feel limited bc i can\u2019t make a huge time commitment.\nanyways, i was wondering if something online/remote would work with flexible hours? and if anyone had advice on how to find that? or even if this whole thing is necessary at all tbh.\nthanks in advance for the help :)",

Really dig in to make sure you\u2019re not doing this for the sake of college apps because adding an internship/job to your schedule will be beyond stressful, online or not. \n\nI don\u2019t have much advice on finding remote work other than being on the lookout online and getting in touch with local organizations/businesses in your area. They might want some small help or might know someone else that does. Best of luck!",

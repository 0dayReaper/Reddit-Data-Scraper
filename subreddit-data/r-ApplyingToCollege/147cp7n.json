    "postText": "I don't have many extracurriculars which is why I'm trying to just dogpile it all on top of my disasterous academic life during junior year (11th) I plan on volunteering at a hospital as soon as I get my license and I plan on joining science olympiad. However, I've heard that it looks incredibly bad to colleges if you started an extracurricular really late (Junior/11th grade). So of course I have to explain it on the application.\n\nTruth betold, I feel like this in its self feels like a utterly disgusting pathetic excuse, and I feel like not even sky man himself would approve. Long story short, I got bullied, then it stopped got better mentally, got bullied again, covid happened, completely devastated and lost all hope, turned things around by still trying to push myself out there sophomore year.\n\nI'm more of worried that the time frames I spent doing something will affect my admission and I am also worried that this can come off as irresponsible and mentally ill, which would hurt more than if I just never mentioned it. Talk about traumadumping in the common app! \n\nWould it be better to just rephrase what I said that way it doesn't sound like a awful Netflix adaptation of a Disney movie or should I just not bat an eye.",

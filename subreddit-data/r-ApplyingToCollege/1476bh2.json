    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m an incoming freshman at UPenn next fall and a highly-aided student. I just discovered that I am eligible for a free laptop and Penn is making me choose between a Dell Latitude 7340 Ultralight and a MacBook Air M2 16GB. Which one do you recommend? I will be a chemical engineering major + I already have an iPhone. Thanks a lot in advance.",

The earlier MacBooks were using Intel chips and could dual boot into Windows, but these M1/M2 ones can't. You can still use a visualization software like Parallels but the performance isn't the same. So try to find out before you make a final choice.",

As an engineering (not chemical though) major, I found that there were lots of programs that we needed that weren\u2019t MacOS compatible, so that may be a factor to consider if you can get any info on that.   \n   \nI still made it through with MacBooks, using bootcamp/parallels (only parallels is an option for M chip MacBooks) and it was perfectly workable though so if you have a strong pref for Mac it will probably be fine still",

    "postText": "I'm interested in both Feminist,Gender and Sexuality Studies as well as CS.I was initially thinking of applying in as a CS major but since that is one of the most competitive majors, I'm now thinking of just going in as a Gender Studies major.\n\nProblem is that I took more STEM classes in the last two years of high school and only one humanities class in those two years.(Sidenote: I am an intl student and my school doesn't necessarily let you pick what classes you want to take,you just take pretty much everything in 9th and 10th and in 11th you get to pick between a more Science based path\\*math,physics,bio,chem... or a Humanities path\\*history,geography,econ...)\n\nSo will my highschool courseload look bad if I go in as a Gender Studies major? And is it even ethical to change majors just so you can increase your chances of admission?\n\n(2nd sidenote: I'm thinking of T100's and LACS)",

It's also okay to have a more STEM-centric lens of Gender studies, but I would think about what that niche is for you so that you can articulate why you want to do gender studies to colleges.",

Don\u2019t do it expecting you can just switch to the other. At schools where this matters when applying, transfer can be challenging",

    "postText": "While applying to college late last year, I reported that I had gotten an A in a class when I had actually gotten a B (only for one semester). This is because my teacher for the class had submitted a grade change form to raise my grade. I held out on actually submitting the college app until the grade change registered in my transcript but it hadn't by the time apps were due so I just submitted them with the A. Fast forward a few months and I got accepted to the school but the grade change had yet to register in the system yet. I was told these things take a long time so I figured it would update at least before graduation. I graduated a week ago and it still says I have a B on my transcript. My final transcripts are due in a few weeks and I'm getting kinda nervous. I don't know who to contact about this either, my teacher doesn't check his email and the counselors' office always sends me to voicemail (which is to be expected since it's summer). If the grade doesn't match, can they rescind my acceptance? Is it too late to contact my college about this? I definitely shouldn't have waited this long before asking about it :-(( Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!!",

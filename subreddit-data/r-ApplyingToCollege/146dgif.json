    "postText": "I'm an incoming Junior and I don't have many EC's but I'm hoping that my EC's can outweigh my low-ish grades. I don't do much, I've volunteered at a summer camp for 4 years (800+ hours), was a teacher's assistant for 2 years, and I'm VP and social media manager for 2 different clubs. I also plan on doing an internship/class thing this summer. Do I need more, and if so, what should I do? I want to go into either psych, child development, or physiology. ",

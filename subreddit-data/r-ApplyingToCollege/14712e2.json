    "postText": "I've been looking into the national college match recently, but I'm wondering if it's actually worth it for my situation. \n\nAs I need aid to afford college, a lot of my friends suggested I look into Questbridge. However, my family's income for four people (75k)  is a bit more than the typical finalist (less than 65k). While QB says this isn't a strict cut off, I worry that it'll affect my chances of getting finalist and getting matched.  Some schools I think only match people with an efc of 0, whereas mine is about 6.5k. \n\nMy mother is the sole breadwinner of the family, and I don't want my college tuition to be an added burden in addition to supporting me and my grandparents. My mom's income is high, but we live in an area where its a bit challenging to live off of this income as my single mother prioritized my education and wanted me to go to the best school that she could reasonably send me (thank you mom).\n\nNot sure if it's worth the time to try to apply for QB or if I'm better off devoting my time to other applications. \n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "Frankly, QB is unique in its National College Match and format. There\u2019s a larger emphasis on supplements and essays and less space for extracurriculars (5 on QuestBridge compared to CommonApp\u2019s 10). That, added onto the fact applicants can essentially Early Decision to multiple schools through the NCM makes it worthwhile for some.\n\nPersonally though, I advise against the NCM because of the early deadlines and tight time constraints. You can see the exact dates [here](https://www.questbridge.org/high-school-students/national-college-match/dates-deadlines) but to sum it up:\n\nYou submit your NCM application in late September, have to finalize your rankings by mid October, and get the results of whether you\u2019re a National College Match Finalist a week(ish) later. \n\nThen, if you are accepted, you have approximately TWO weeks (for the up to 15 schools you ranked) to actually apply. Little time considering you need to complete supplementals and submit financial aid paperwork\n\nMeaning, you\u2019ll not only be applying to SEVERAL selective schools but also be doing them as your first applications \u2014 typically with less than a month (or month and a half if you get started before you\u2019re even accepted into NCM) to do them. \n\nNot only that \u2014 with your EFC many schools will give you plenty of need-based aid.  [For example, Wellesley has loan free aid if your EFC is under 7k](https://blog.prepscholar.com/colleges-that-offer-complete-financial-aid). While HWCs aren\u2019t for everyone \u2014 keep in mind that you don\u2019t NEED QB to get need-based aid. \n\nThough, you can also use the QuestBridge Application during Regular Decision \u2014 meaning you don\u2019t need to deal with the short timeframe of the NCM. Through this, you can apply to schools with no application fees and benefit from QB\u2019s unique format [(see more here)](https://www.questbridge.org/high-school-students/regular-decision)\n\nWeigh your options and what you want during this upcoming app season. QB is great in its own ways but you make good points about getting accepted as a finalist. I don\u2019t have insight on that \u2014 so I wish you the best of luck.",

I didn't know that QB only had 5 spots for extracurriculars. that might be better for me as I haven't had the opportunities to do as many extracurriculars as some of my peers. im still wary of the timeframe so ill have to look into it more .. thank you so much again",

            "comment": "It did not work for us with the same or similar income, even though child was very qualified. In fact, we really regretted wasting so much time and energy on QB in addition to Common App in the second round. Child made it into a top LAC thru Common App and gets substantial financial aid. She was a QB finalist but did not match b/c of our EFC being similar to yours, we believe. So, my personal recommendation for families with EFC greater than 0 is to apply to colleges that meet 100% demonstrated  financial need thru Common App. You will get the same or similar financial package as QB kids. You will likely have to contribute some (quite minimal) amt toward your child's education given your not very low income. The biggest problem is, of course, being able to get into such colleges, as they are very, very selective.",

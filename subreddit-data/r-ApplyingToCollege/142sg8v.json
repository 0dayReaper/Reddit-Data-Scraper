The OIR site also has factbooks on admissions, average grades in courses, etc.\n\nNotice that the top 10 concentrations at the undergraduate level consist of 3 physical sciences, 2 life/medical sciences, 4 social sciences, and only 1 of the humanities.\n\nGoes to show that Brown's reputation for being humanities-focused is very much a relic of the past.\n\nEnjoy!",

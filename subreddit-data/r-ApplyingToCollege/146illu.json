    "postText": "  \nLet's say I got a C in AP Physics 1 both semesters my Sophomore Year, and I got A's both semesters of AP Physics 2 my Junior year. After some research, I've seen that colleges don't generally accept AP Physics 1 and 2 for credit in skipping their college courses in a major, rather it's AP Physics C: Mechanics and 1 and 2 are only accepted if it's towards a GE. Would taking the equivalent of Physics C: Mechanics at a local community college during the summer between sophomore to junior year and getting an A be advantageous to my application and offset the bad grade of a C? Would I also get credit for this class in a college?  \nAlso, since if a college does not accept credit for an ap exam (i.e. UC Berkeley not accepting AP Physics 1 and 2 for credit, only AP Physics C: Mehanics), do they still care if you took the exam or not?  \nWould it look bad or would I be at a disadvantage if I took an AP class and didn't take the exam?",

            "comment": "If you're in CA you can check [assist.org](https://assist.org) and see whether your CCC physics class would map to a physics class at a UC. I think outside of that it'll be on a case-by-case basis but there's a good chance you can get out of the Physics 1 equivalent in college (or know enough to test out) if the content coverage in your CC class is similar  \n\n\nWith that said you probably don't even need to take AP Physics 2 if it's convenient to keep doing the CC sequence during the school year and knock out E&amp;M + Modern or Thermo or whatever comes after",

            "comment": "Taking calculus-based mechanics would certainly strengthen your application because it demonstrates you are capable of taking physics at that level of rigor. However, I don't think that A would offset the C because.. well.. it's still a C. You'll get credit if that course transfers to your university. Typically, credits only transfer in-state.",

This framework is obviously meant to be further developed on, but helps you get started.\n\n1) **What impact do you want to have?**\n\n* This can mean whatever it means to you\u2014 that\u2019s the point. Whether impact is impact on the world, impact on others, impact on the environment, etc. doesn\u2019t matter. Ask yourself what impact you wanna have and filter out the majors/jobs that won\u2019t give you the opportunity to bring that impact.\n\n2) **What life do you want to have?**\n\n* Do you want a fat house, a fast car, and extravagant $50,000 vacations? Do you just want a simple life? Do you want to be a nomad and live on the road? Filter out the majors/jobs that can\u2019t give you the life you want. That means majors/jobs that won\u2019t give you the monetary compensation, work life balance, flexibility, etc. that you need to live the life you want.\n\n3) **What will make you happy?**\n\n* What\u2019s going to bring you happiness and fulfillment? What\u2019s going to give you mentally-stimulating work? Where are you going to find terrific classmates/coworkers that make you happy and can be your friends? What major/job is going to make you happy to walk in everyday? Filter out what wont be able to make you happy.\n\nOnce you\u2019re done, you should have a list of things. If not, re-evaluate and look around for more options. Read more on majors, schools, and career paths. \n\nI\u2019m probably gonna catch some flak for happiness being the last step in the framework, but hear me out. Having food on the table, having a good house over your head, being able to provide for your family, etc. is far more important than being happy. Take care of your financial security first and find happiness later, because doing it this way will save you from risks like homelessness and going hungry. A lot of college students end up prioritizing their happiness in college workout prioritizing their financial security, which makes it MUCH harder to work on later, and graduate without jobs. Then you have the risks we discussed and on top of that, you\u2019ll probably lose that happiness because it\u2019s not very easy being happy when you\u2019re not financially-stable. The impact of money on happiness is something only glossed over by those who have never really struggled to find money for their housing, their next meal, their bills, their debts, etc. Not being able to afford to pay your bills SUCKS. Since we had impact as your first filter anyways, even a major/job you\u2019re not totally happy with should at least give you some fulfillment since the ultimate goal is your impact mission.",

The order is more based on personal preference, but I put impact first because thinking strategically about your impact is better to consider a wider variety of careers than the others. Starts you off with a better mindset",

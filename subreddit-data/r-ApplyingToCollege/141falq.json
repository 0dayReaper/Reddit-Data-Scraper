    "postText": "I am literally 3 days away from summer and i still dont have a plan... i was thinking from the beginning that i wasnt gonna do a summer program bc i thought it was lowkey pointless and i was trying to find an internship. But it was hard to find one that aligns with my interests as a high school student and when I found something interesting, it was only open to the city's residents that i dont live in. Also i can't be paid due to my student visa so i can't work either. I emailed a few people to find unpaid internship/volunteer but it was hard to keep in touch. Then my school's teacher recommended that I take summer college credit courses over the summer so I applied one of the online courses without checking the tuition (this is my bad). I was admitted and I was relieved that I finally have summer plans and I can take classes that I like but it turns out to be too expensive and my dad said he can't afford (I 100% understand but i j never thought this would happen because i already go to a private school that costs a lot) and now my dad is mad at me for not being on top of things... luckily a few days ago i was talking to one of my teachers about the summer and she said she could help me find summer unpaid internship and we are going to talk about it today so i hope it works out but im just so scared that my dad is mad...(and i had to pay $75 to apply for the summer credit courses \ud83d\ude2d)",

You need to plan ahead some internships open up 5-6 months before they start and close 2-3 months later because they get so many applicants. \n\nIt sucks that going to college has gotten so competitive, back in my day no one did summer work or internships but things have really changed and once you are in high school you need to be on top of things.",

My youngest wanted to get involved helping young kids who had recently arrived in the US.  They contacted a group that helps low-income families of all kinds with housing and educational needs and worked as a tutor and day camp counselor for this group  throughout high school.  They also volunteered for an organization that helps women and kids get back on their feet after dealing with spousal abuse.  During Covid, they offered to raise funds and purchase school supplies and holiday gifts for displaced kids. Both organizations were thoughtful enough to send letters of commendation, which they used in the awards section of their common application.\n\nAnother possibility \u2014 or something you could do in tandem with an internship or volunteer gig \u2014  is to take an inexpensive but fun class at your local parks &amp; recreation and work on a hobby for your extracurriculars.  You could get scuba certified, learn screenwriting techniques, or try your hand at graphic arts.",

Make sure you know how the Common App Works.\n\nYou only get 10 EC slots. For me, I scrambled to do a bunch of stuff over the summer, and I ended up having like 15 ECs that were meaningful to me. It wasn't a good place to be. Some of my friends had like 7 and got into t10 colleges with like 3 of them being one week things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnderstand that not everything is about how long you do it. It's all about how you can write about something.\n\nExample 1: A 1 week shadowing opportunity could easily be a slot - and this could easily be something you write an entire supplement on\n\nExample 2: You find some topic you're interested in. Research the origins of the topic, the history, the current related news. Watch interesting videos, write a little bit. Maybe email your teachers - You can literally put this down as independent learning and fill another slot\n\nExample 3: Volunteer somewhere. You don't have to do a ton of hours. Obviously it's best if you go for a few weeks for like a few hours each week. If you can write about what you learned, that's all you need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's 3 really easy examples right there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpend some time just thinking about your app in general. What major? What specific career goals with that major? How will the essays complement your application?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPM me if you want more",

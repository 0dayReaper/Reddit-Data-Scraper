    "postText": "So I want to major in physics, but I only started exploring it in my junior year. My ecs are all related to CS, with one related to physics. How will this effect me on college apps? \n\nI like physics a lot, so even if my chances are affected, I think I'll still go with it. But I am a little unsure, because I got exposure to it pretty late and haven't gone too in-depth.",

Physics majors often change, and can usually do so pretty easily to most other stem degrees.",

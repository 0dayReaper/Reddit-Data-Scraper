When I looked at my transcript again my GPA went from a 3.64 to a 3.6098 gpa when the counselor changed the credit on my trascript, I don't know if this is important but I did received a A in the course that she changed the credit on.\n\nShould I even bother to email her back about my GPA because its summer ofc or should I just wait till I go back to school",

            "comment": "Public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. Eliminate the UCs, as you will not be able to afford them.Merit from UCs is extremely limited and nowhere near sufficient to cover the full cost of attendance (which is what you will need).\n\nIt's possible UW offers merit, but I would be skeptical that they'd offer anywhere close to enough to make it affordable for you. Check their merit scholarship website to see. Regardless, it would be a financial reach.\n\nLook at Questbridge [https://www.questbridge.org/high-school-students/national-college-match](https://www.questbridge.org/high-school-students/national-college-match)\n\nI suggest expanding your list. You will be applying test optional, which adds an element of risk. Add more in-state safeties that are known to be affordable. Also note that your reaches are more like super-reaches.\n\nFor every school on your list, check affordability. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Note, \"FAFSA\" is just a form. FAFSA doesn't give you aid except for federal student loans and the Pell grant. Most financial grants - which you must have to afford college - come directly from the colleges themselves.)\n\nIf your high school has Naviance (or maybe SCOIR), check the scattergrams for admission results with your GPA for the schools on your list.",

As a planner, I try to stay humble when engaging with people because I fundamentally believe *they* are the experts of their own community - not me. The only way anyone is changing their mind is hearing it from their neighbor. \n\nMIT definitely challenged me as a planner and designer. I took a lot of great planning courses focused on community engagement. Probably my favorite was my Negotiations course. In that way, yes, MIT helped me develop the problem solving skills to navigate tricky politics - once, a project I was working on was taken over by a protest. \n\nJust remembered but [Tufts](https://as.tufts.edu/environmentalstudies/academics/undergraduate-programs/babs-environmental-studies-co-major/thematic-tracks/track-ii-sustainability-policy-and-equity) might be a good option too. They have an urban studies minor but you can potentially do a 5th year combined BS-Masters. And you can major in environmental studies - with a focus in sustainability, equity, and policy\n\nFeel free to PM me for more questions.",

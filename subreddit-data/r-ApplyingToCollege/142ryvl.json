    "postText": "I'm a high schooler who just finished my junior year, and am interested in majoring in economics. My college counseling department has recommended we begin putting together a list of schools we like/would apply to. I was just looking at the US News rankings for econ programs and something really odd caught my attention. The University of Minnesota Twin Cities is ranked #18! Not only that but it is ranked higher than Brown, UVA, Vanderbilt, WashU, Georgetown, Rice Notre Dame, and of course many places that are \u201csupposed\u201d to be \u201cbetter\u201d. Of course I understand rankings are far from everything and weird decisions are often made, but still! I\u2019ve never really heard about UMinnesota before (I\u2019m from NJ), but what makes its econ program so good?",

One can go to Yale and do the bare minimum to remain in good standing (my close friend\u2019s kid) or attend The University of Arizona and work on the DART Mission.  I\u2019d personally ask more about campus life and how you might spend the next four years.  For example, are your classmates friendly and tolerant; what campus activities have they most enjoyed; are many majors and clubs capped or limited to a certain number of participants; is course registration a hassle (not enough sections for popular prerequisites); do juniors and seniors have trouble getting into classes required to graduate; do academic and job placement advising have a good reputation among students; are student mental health services adequate; do they like their college town; and how do they spend their free time.  I\u2019d also ask an open-ended question, such as naming their favorite and least favorite things about their university.",

Do students tend to just watch TV on the weekends or go out and explore the area with each other? Do students actually care about the classes or are they there to get their degrees and dip? Is it really easy to find a list of internships to apply to, or do you have to go digging in the University\u2019s career advancement office?\n\nIt\u2019s not so much the actual answers that matter, but the degree of passion and thoughtfulness that you can take out of an upperclassman\u2019s response. I, for one, love going out to explore the surrounding areas of my campus with friends, and I love the care and passion of the students in my classes \u2014 and I think that really shows through by my responses to these kinds of questions compared to more \u201cset informational answer\u201d questions.",

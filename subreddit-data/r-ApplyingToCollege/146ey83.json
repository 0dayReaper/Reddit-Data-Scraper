            "comment": "Check out the admissions pages of some schools in Alabama, if that's where you hope to attend school.  If there's one within commuting distance of where you live now, then that would be a good place to start.  Otherwise, if you think you have a shot at Alabama or Auburn, could look at their pages.\n\nBasically you look for schools whose requirements you satisfy, apply, and submit whatever materials they ask for.  This could involve taking the SAT or ACT, and will probably involve getting a copy of your HS transcript.\n\nI took a look at the UA and Auburn websites- both have a search function where you can find your specific admissions counselor/recruiter based on either the Alabama HS you graduated from, or the county you live in.  I would look up those individuals and email them about whether there's anything special you should know about applying as a non-traditional student.  For instance, what to do about teacher letters of recommendation given you've been out of school for three years.",

Taking classes at a CC first then transferring those to a 4Y school can potentially save you a year's worth of tuition at the 4Y school, but you need to be strategic about which classes you take at the CC.  You want them to for-sure transfer, and you want them to actually fulfill degree requirements.\n\nThe biggest challenge for you will probably be:  how to pay for school.  If you have to keep working full-time then that makes being a full-time student really really hard if not impossible.\n\nOf course, you might also get financial aid.  Unfortunately, since you're only 21 or 22, your parents' income is still considered when calculating your financial need.  (Unless you've been or are currently married, or serviced in the armed forces and were honorably discharged.)",

    "postText": "Attended a Georgia Tech admissions session and learned definitively that financial aid may not be in the picture if I get accepted into this school. To elaborate, I practically need financial aid and cannot afford it otherwise, so should I bother applying if I do want to go here. My gut instinct says yes to see the financial package/scholarship I get, but I\u2019m curious to see y\u2019all\u2019s opinions.",

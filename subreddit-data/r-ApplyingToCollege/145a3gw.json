    "postText": "Hello! I'm a rising junior and currently building my college list. I want to pursue a career as a concept artist, so I plan on majoring in Graphic Design. Due to the recent \"shift\" towards AI image generation (in air quotes because I really don't think the arts are all that threatened but that's not the point of the post lol), my parents are pushing me towards double majoring in Compsci. This presents a couple issues for me, the largest of which being that my dream school, RISD, only offers a minor in CS (Before anyone comments, I know about the double degree program w/ Brown, I just have a snowflake's chance in hell of getting into it). In addition, many of the other schools I'm interested in for their Graphic Design programs have sort of mediocre CS programs, which has been a massive point of contention between my parents and I. And also, I just... don't really want to double major. I've always planned on graduating early, which I know is kind of a dumb reason, but still. Is there any real benefit to double majoring in Graphic Design and CS, or would I just be wasting my time?",

            "comment": "It does give you a back up since the arts can be kinda unstable but if you don't have passion for it then a double major might not be a good idea, cause double majoring takes a lot of work and planning and more so when the majors are pretty separate (compared to like, a biology and microbology double major), can cause you to have a higher workload on top of everything else you'll be doing which can be really tough. Also I belive cs is a tougher major with a higher workload which could complicate things more. So I wouldn't recomend a double major unless you're very passionate about both subjects and it would provide a clear benifit. Go to the school you want to and minor in cs if your parents keep pushing. Also think about if you did go to another school like they wanted and double majored and you started struggling from the workload which major would they try and get you to drop (im thinking they might try and get you to drop graphic design but i might be wrong here). A double major would likely take away time for internships, working, study abroad and other similar activities, having a social life, and could esialy stress you out much more than it would be worth if you don't even want to do cs as a job. Now if cs is your back up job because you genuinely like the subject and would be happy working in it then that's diffrent and might be worth it but idk, good luck",

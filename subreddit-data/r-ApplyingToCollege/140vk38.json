I have to pick between two amazing options, which would be the most adventageous in college apps?\n\noption 1: brown pre-college (15 hours per week, 2 weeks; online program on feminism and philosophy)\n\noption 2: ballet (1.5 to 4 hours weekly, every week for the forseeable future; i've never done ballet before. this is meant as cross-training for my main sport)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbackground on me: hs class of '25; intended majors of psychology and public policy; figure skater (will likely do at the college level but will not be going professional post-college)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlmk if any more info is needed, tysm in advance for your help!",

Being older I feel like it was unwise to spend all that, I just wanted to use an opportunity to get away and do a vacation-y thing. and if it's remote i just don't think it's very worth it. i did like my course and stuff but the educational value is not huge and its definitely not big for college. if you have enough money that it doesnt matter that's epic but otherwise id think it over.\n\nif you wanna do the ballet, i'd totally recommend that. sounds great to me",

My sister attended Cornell, her roomie was a figure skater who individually coached hockey team members to improve their skating skills.\n\nSister was an NCAA athlete, colleges tend to put the sporty people together as roomies, she lived in a dorm with a training table refectory.\n\nI know everyone who applied for vet school (very competitive, less than 30 programs total) who was also connected with Cornell sports got in, most at Cornell. \n\nI think Cornell and Harvard are the two Ivy hockey powerhouses.\n\nI can definitely see you being able to craft a narrative here. See if you can get some skating instructor experience with hockey players, then reach out to coaching staffs before you apply. D1 and D3 have great schools.\n\nBallet is great, but how about using that time for coaching (and academic tutoring for potential NCAA-eligible students)? Tremendous hook!\n\nYou\u2019ll have a job, admission, love life if you want it, and professional career. Professional schools and alums love scholar/athletes, and you won\u2019t have the employment restrictions from NCAA.",

            "comment": "My two cents is neither are inherently likely to do much for highly selective college admissions, which is fine because not everything you do has to be about that.\n\nYou apparently already have the one thing you will be citing as your main activity, figure skating, and that will likely dominate your \"score\" for activities (ECs/non-recruited athletics).  It is both rather late and also likely unnecessary to be trying to expand your activity list in new ways, because as pretty much everyone with actual knowledge of the admissions process will tell you, it is depth and quality of a few activities, including potentially just one time-consuming activity, that usually makes an impact, not a longer list of shallower activities.\n\nAnd in fact, even if you really want to think about this through the lens of college admissions anyway--probably the only way either would matter much is if it led to something else that mattered.  Like, if Option 2 led to you being better as a figure skater (which seems the intent), then that might be helpful for that reason, but not because it added another line to your activity list.  But, possibly if Option 1 led to you doing some related club activity where you took on a significant leadership role (although I again note time is getting short for that, as others in your cohort might already be farther down that path), then that might also be helpful for that reason.  And so on.\n\nBut again thinking about everything you do in this way is ultimately more likely to be more counterproductive than helpful.  If you think of yourself right now as a very good student who is also a very good figure skater, you should be comfortable with that being your \"brand\" for college admissions.\n\nSo time and energy spent on continuing to do well in increasingly difficult classes and continuing to develop as a figure skater will generally be time and energy well spent from a college admissions standpoint.  And then with your remaining time and energy, you really can just think in terms of experiences you will value, definitely including social experiences, and not worry about whether it will look good on an application.\n\nAnd indeed, a genuine, social, happy person is also more likely to check the last big box for the most competitive colleges anyway, as they tend to use \"personal\" ratings of some sort to make the last cut among the too-many applicants who meet their academic and activity standards for admissions.  Unfortunately a lot of people seem to try to address this factor just by trying to fake being a genuine, social, happy person in their essays, and I think admission officers are often able to see through that.  In contrast, it will likely be a lot easier to convince admissions officers you are the type of person they are looking for if you are actually that type of person.",

A ballet intensive might be a better choice to jumpstart your ballet\u2026especially if the studio has a specific program for competitor of other sports like skating.\n\nYour skating coach should be able to recommend a studio they\u2019ve worked with in the past. The assumption is that you are trying to improve your artistry at this point...if you don\u2019t already have the conditioning for competitive skating it probably won\u2019t do much for that.\n\nWhich makes more difference on your app?  \n\nNeither really\u2026especially given Brown is online.  \n\nThe ballet is only useful to your app if you become more competitive\u2026if you aren\u2019t already competitive at the Junior level it\u2019s unlikely to get you to the Junior Nationals.  There\u2019s only 2 seasons left.\n\nFor individual sports like skating it strikes me that you really have to get to at least national level of competition before it moves the needle much.  Otherwise it\u2019s just something you did.\n\nKnowing what we know now we\u2019d have dumped dance and TKD for field hockey and lacrosse\u2026\n\nIf this is a monetary limitation (otherwise just do both right?) then if you were my daughter I\u2019d recommend ballet at a cheaper level and reserve some money to visit colleges with skating teams (vs clubs) during the school year when they are active.  \n\nI\u2019d find a high match for your academics from that list of schools and if your skating is strong enough visit that one, meet the coach and see if that can become a hook for you.  Maybe even a low reach.\n\nIt depends on your academics and your skills\u2026if you aren\u2019t already doing well at qualifiers/sectionals/regionals it\u2019s not likely to become a strong hook.",

If so, wouldn\u2019t hurt to get your foot in the door. \n\nI don\u2019t think either of these things would move the needle enough to change an admission decision. But definitely just beginning ballet I don\u2019t think will mean much. \n\nIt all just depends what you want to prioritize - showing you can successfully do college level Ivy League work, or doing something that might make you marginally better at your main sport\n\nI will say proceed with *slight* caution. As someone who does both ballet and figure skating, my coaches say that sometimes they most definitely compliment each other. But other times the slight difference in arm placements, weight shifting, etc can actually confuse students a little \n\nBest of luck with whatever you pick! Like I said, either one shouldn\u2019t be the deciding factor in a college app. So go where your happiness lies!",

It could also be an eye opener if you realize that that's NOT the career you want to be in (like in my daughter's case). I would say that it's more valuable than an intro ballet class (unless you think that ballet is going to help your competitive skating enormously)",

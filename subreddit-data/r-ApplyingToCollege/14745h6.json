    "postText": "Hi, I just checked my transcript and I have a 3.679 unweighed and a 3.821 weighed GPA. Freshman year for the first semester I got 3 B\u2019s but the rest from there on I continuously got 2 B\u2019s each semester. I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m able to improve it by working hard Junior and Senior year but I\u2019m unsure that would help. I was wondering if anyone had experienced this as well and if they have any advice to give. Thank you!",

If you really don't know how to calculate a GPA that doesn't say much for your school, given that you must have had at least a B in math.  Depending on how weighting in your school works, you may also have more chances for better weightings as you get into more AP classes.",

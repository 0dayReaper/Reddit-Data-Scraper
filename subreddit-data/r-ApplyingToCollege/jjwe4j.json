No point submitting early tbh since I\u2019ve already applied early to a non US school and hopefully I get my results before I apply regular decision. \n\nI\u2019d say wait u might get a good score that would boost ur application and there\u2019s not rlly any advantage to apply early.",

For example, at UNC, they take nearly all of their out of state students in early action and almost none in regular decision. For Michigan, it was important for me because to be considered for Ross, I had to be accepted into LSA first; since I got into LSA in December I got my Ross application looked at before people who didn\u2019t get into LSA until regular decision, and Ross is essentially first come first serve. Early action also may be considered if you get deferred to regular decision and the admissions officers are looking at two people, one who applied early and one who didn\u2019t.  It usually has some benefits.",

Today I found out she dated my brother for close to 6 months and that she would marry him in a heartbeat, so one day she might become my sister in law. And then I spent all morning chatting with her and a different relative and only got about an hour of work done when I should have gotten about 10 hours in.\n\nMy early applications are literally the last things on my mind right now. I'm definitely not getting into UChicago or Columbia if this is the kind of shit I focus on in the last three days.",

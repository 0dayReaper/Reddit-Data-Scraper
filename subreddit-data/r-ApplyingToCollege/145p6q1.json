    "postText": "As of a couple hours ago, my dad lost his job. He is the sole income provider in our family. He was making about $125k. So far, his YTD earnings are about $55k.\n\nI am a rising junior in high school. My parents do not have much saved (maybe $10k) for my college because my dad\u2019s income wasn\u2019t very good until the last few years. As such, I am trying to find ways that will allow me to go to college as cheap as possible.\n\nIn the event that my dad is unemployed for the next few months (likely), will FAFSA use this year\u2019s tax information to calculate EFC? Please keep in mind I am a rising junior and that I will be applying to colleges sometime around November 2024. I assume that they will not use 2024 tax information since taxes are not due until April 2025 for that year, and they will instead use 2023 taxes. Is that correct?",

But there should be a place to add additional information like this. As well, you can contact the schools you are applying to and explain the situation further. \n\nSorry, I can't really remember anymore from last year but you didn't have any comments yet on your post and I wanted you to have a response. What I would do is contact FAFSA or your guidance counselor at school and get some advice for when you do apply. One step at a time - this is a stressful situation for your family and I don't want you to get overly panicked at this point about this with everything else going on.",

And you will have to redo the FAFSA every year for financial aid regardless.",

    "postText": "This girl from school invited me over to her house for a study session. I\u2019ve had all the same classes with her for the past three years (we\u2019re juniors) but she\u2019s quiet, and we\u2019ve never really talked. I was surprised when she asked me over, but I accepted to be nice.\n\nWe were studying in the living room and I had to use the bathroom, so I went down the hall to find it, but took a wrong turn into her bedroom. And you wouldn\u2019t believe what I found. Right when you open her door, there\u2019s a bulletin hanging on the wall with the names of the top 10 students in our grade (we do class rank and I\u2019m in the top 10, and so is she). That itself isn\u2019t all that creepy I guess. Maybe it\u2019s some weird sort of motivation thing. \n\nBut she has a bulleted list beneath each name of weirdly personal information. Under mine, she had \u201cPlays basketball, involved in FBLA, interested in UChicago/Northwestern, strong in English class, weak in math class, multiple state level awards.\u201d I was just shocked and super shaken up. I didn\u2019t even know she paid any attention to me at all. Like, I was seriously scared. It reminded me of something from 48 Hours. I made an excuse and left quickly afterward.\n\nIs she dangerous? Like, is this some short of hitlist? Is she planning to harm me?",

My family was high pressure, be the best, do the best, shoot for the top.\n\nI wanted to 1-make sure I was heading to a school that was not going to be attended by other students so I could get out of that dead ass town, and 2-was keeping track so I could make myself unique on my application. \n\nIt was hard growing up in a small town with no extra curriculars aside from farming (4-H, FFA, ag studies) and sports (and only 3 sports options for girls.) So I HAD to put in a ton of extra work, beyond sports and farming. I had to get involved in politics, take extra classes at the community college, community services, etc.",

Leave it at that.  Do not involve the school unless she says something specific about harming you or someone else.

My peers in the AP/honors classes had parents who were busy preparing my classmates for college since they were in elementary school. All my AP/honors peers had a \u201cwell rounded\u201d balance of school, extra curricular clubs/sports, and volunteerism. I started my junior year feeling absolutely shell shocked because I had NONE of that. Guidance from teachers and counselors couldn\u2019t give me proper advice on how to get myself \u201ccollege application ready\u201d \u2014 so I quite literally looked up to my peers who had Ivy Leagues on their dream schools list to figure out what I could do for myself. I was super embarrassed to feel behind my peers so I was quiet in my observations. I don\u2019t remember formally writing anything down like what this girl has written here, but it definitely reminds me of the list I had in my head of the smart, successful kids in my AP classes. \n\nI wish I was braver at the time to admit I was having a hard time keeping my head above the water, and I was jealous that my peers could swim so seemingly easily. \n\nShe sounds like she\u2019s anxious about college or fitting in to me. If it had anything romantic/hateful on it I would consider that a huge red flag to a scarier issue. But this is your life, remember to trust your gut.",

She wants friends and wants to be successful in her studies so she wants to befriend the highest performing students.\n\nI could see myself doing something like this tbh since I\u2019m terrible at remembering people, I struggle to link people\u2019s names, faces, personalities and history together and I\u2019m often scared I\u2019ll mix things up and embarrass myself, so having a small \u2018library\u2019 of friends or people I would like to know would be practical. Haven\u2019t done it because I\u2019m too lazy to go and search up and write down such information and because, yeah it\u2019s fairly creepy when views from an outside perspective.",

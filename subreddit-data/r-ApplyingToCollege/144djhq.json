    "postText": "I recently went on a TAMU tour and it was the worst thing ever compared to other colleges in TX. Everything was bland and the walks were atrocious. Not a lick of soul on this campus. I don\u2019t understand how so many people in TX are ride-or-dies for this place. Maybe it\u2019s a lot better when school is in or something though, but for today, TAMU gets a 2/5 on my college scale.\n\nI was considering Physics&amp;Astronomy or Aerospace Engineering fyi",

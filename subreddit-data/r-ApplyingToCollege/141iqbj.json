    "postText": "Title. I\u2019ve currently put AP chem on my schedule because the college   \nthat I want to apply needs a letter of rec from my science teacher. I\u2019ve  \n already taken all regular and honors sciences. The other option would   \nbe to take Intro to chem at a local CC, which I've heard is significantly easier than AP Chem. But I am not sure how good a recommendation from a college professor is. What should I do? I think it's a dumb reason to take  a hard class. But I'm not sure what to do. Need advice.",

Generally most colleges want to see 3 years of science (bio, Chem, physics), so unless you took multiple science classes at the same time in previous years you should take a science this year regardless. And if you really don\u2019t have any other classes yea just as a 10th grade teacher, just be sure they remember you and know you well.",

            "comment": "Well both my kids went throught the music audition process.  Didn't apply to Curtis or Juilliard though.  Juilliard is known to be pretty expensive for undergrads so some people avoid for that reason.  EVERYONE and their brother applies to curtis because it is highly affordable - free tuition.  My oldest was not interested in straight conservatory programs.  My younger is a soprano.  I'm sure the soprano acceptance rate is below 1-3%  Didn't feel like a good use of time.  You really have time to audition for maybe 6-8 programs through the season, you really have to pick carefully.  Especially if you're hoping for merit money.  A lot of \"top\" programs are very expensive for undergrad, especially in very competitive tracks.  So you'll see a mix of talent levels at most programs.  And when I say that, yes EVERYONE is talented and prepared.  But there is variation.\n\nMusic is super competitive almost everywhere you've heard of.  Even state flagships that aren't known for music may have below a 10-20 percent acceptance rate for popular tracks.\n\nMy oldest kid wanted to double degree.  Had a great experience at a well regarded public univeristy and got tons of merit.  Graduated this year with 2 degrees.  Kid #2 is going straight music heading to college this fall.  Got a ton of merit to attend a private university in a large city.   The music faculty there is OTT amazing.\n\nHere's a little known fact.  Music therapy programs are INCREDIBLY competitive most places.",

There also was a nice balance between technical ability and musicality. It takes a well balanced musician to gain access to any top tier music school, including: Curtis, Juilliard, Eastman, CIM, NEC, Indiana, or even a place like McGill. Oh, and Colburn and any international music schools.",

Did double degree and got a bunch of money to do so, it was a nice balance.  Some peak early and some don't. It's a range.\n\nEarly bloomers sometimes do burn out.  My kid was called a prodigy by some teachers.  I have lots of feelings about it, I really dislike that word.  I will say my slower blooming music kid is more focused now on music and performance at 18 than my \"prodigy\" that ended up double degree.",

It\u2019s also difficult to reconcile that there\u2019s no safety out there that has an accredited music Ed component. Her safety is a different major altogether with a minor in her instrument. Plus some of the top schools that aren\u2019t stand alone conservatories are at schools that are just never spoken of on here like the Uof North TX or Indiana U. I\u2019m hoping that everyone passes  their auditions and portfolio pre reads!",

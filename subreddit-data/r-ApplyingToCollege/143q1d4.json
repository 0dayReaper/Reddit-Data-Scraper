What do I need to do, what classes do I need to take to get accepted into  Texas A&amp;M as a computer science student in (preferably) Honors? What courses do I need to take? What extra stuff should I do? Does anyone have accurate CS admissions statistics?\n\nIm transferring from UH (Uni. Of Houston).",

            "comment": "As a transfer student myself, I believe getting a good GPA is most important. Try to achieve a 4.0, as it will tell other universities that you can successfully handle college coursework. Make sure to build relationships with your professors as well (office hours, participation, etc), as they will write LORs for you. Be involved on campus (clubs, etc). Being in the Honors College will definitely help. Lastly, I strongly advise that you start early on your application: a quick Google search yields that TAMU is rolling transfer, so the earlier you submit the better. It will be difficult trying to juggle finishing applications and midterms/finals at the same time.",

The application process will be similar; in fact, some schools require less supplementals than first-year applications.",

    "postText": "I am a class of 2024 student and a rising senior so obviously I will be applying in the fall/winter of 2023. Now that school is done, I wanted to start on my essays very soon (or at least have the foundation) as I have a very packed summer ahead of me and I don't see myself being able to give any time for college apps/SAT during the designated weeks that I am at a summer camp. \n\nI am wondering how many of the prompts and questions for essays from the 2022-23 admission cycle are going to be consistent with the 2023-24 admission on the common app. The only knowledge I have is that the UCs are obviously going to stay same with their PIQ's and the Personal statement will also be same for the most part. I've been hesitant to sit down and start writing because I'm scared that the prompts aren't finalized and that they'll change for the next cycle. \n\nHere are schools that I'm thinking about applying to (**this is DEFINITELY not final and i'm trimming this down - please do not tell me your opinion on the list**)\n\nDartmouth\r  \nHarvard  \nYale  \nBrown  \nUPenn  \nPrinceton  \nNorthwestern\r  \nUSC\r  \nGeorgetown\r  \nMichigan\r  \nEmory  \nUT Austin  \nVanderbilt  \nWake Forest  \nU of washington  \nMichigan State  \nSDSU\n\nIf y'all can provide your insight and knowledge on how much of the essays that are required for the school will change next year, such as supplement prompts and etc, I'm sure it would not only help myself but every other prospective student trying to write their essays over summer!! thank u sm",

            "comment": "It is definitely very important to begin writing your essays over the summer! One essay that will definitely not change and that you can start immediately is your personal statement. Regarding supplementals, most schools will not change their essay prompts, and if so, very slightly. You can safely begin writing these essays. There are certain schools, though, that vary their supplementals by year (see UChicago).",

    "postText": "If I submit my ed application to a university say Cornell, am I not allowed to apply ea at the same time to other universities like umiami or something, as the ed and ea deadlines are around the same so if I wait until my ed decision the ea deadline would pass, with no guarantee that I will be admitted to my ed school. I'm aware that if admitted to ed we have to withdraw applications from other colleges. The same goes for rd, are we allowed to apply rd around the same time too when applying for ed and ea because some colleges?\nI was sure that we can apply but I read in an article and got quite confused, where they said we can't apply and have to wait till the ed decisions are out.",

It's just up to the student to read the relevant background info and learn that specific topic and then do the experiment, which involves following specific protocols already laid out for you (so if you're working in genetics lab, you really only need to understand how the one gene that you're studying, and a few other related ones works, in order to complete a research project in that subject).",

Because you would be receiving mentorship on how to properly confuct a project and may get to network that way.\n\nI know humanities students who have reached out to college professors and have gotten amazing internships that way! So, definitely go for it. Although know that usually you have to email a lot of people in order for cold-emailing to be successful.",

She got more responsibility as time went on. \n\nMy son joined a university research program for high schoolers that had competitive entry. The first six months was about reading up on previous research in this area so that they could contribute. Over the course of 3 years he ended up writing multiple original papers, a couple which won recognition that a graduate student would be proud of.",

The idea itself stemmed from one of the papers that we had researched, and thankfully it didn't require anything beyond a computer and time. After gaining a result, we then approached the lab director about our results and research, which then led to a published research paper.\n\nWe DEFINITELY got a ton of advice and guidance, and our validation had to be done in a lab, so we wouldn't have been able to publish it without their help (also the submit fees were enormous, but the lab had a free waiver)\n\nTLDR; get a internship with a lab or read lots of research papers",

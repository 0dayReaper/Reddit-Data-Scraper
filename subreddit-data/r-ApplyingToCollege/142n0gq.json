Why should they choose someone who is only strong in one area?\n\nGPA is not a substitute for ECs and ECs is not a substitute for GPA. They indicate different things about an applicant. When I used to review applications, I first looked at grades and more standardized markers like SAT/ACT. If you had strong academic markers, then I look to see what ECs you have been doing, your essays, LORs, etc to see if you would benefit from my school and understand who you are as a person.",

He was known for not being a very talkative guy, so the woman sitting next to him said \"I bet I can make you say more than two words during dinner\" (or something to that effect) and he simply responded with \"you lose\". I'm sure there are variations to the story, but that's the one I remember hearing when I was little.\n\nEdit: I think it was actually that Calvin remained silent the entire evening, and at the end of the dinner said \"you lose\".

It\u2019s been less than a lifetime ago that Jim Crow laws were banned, and to think that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 fixed everything is absurd. Outlawing discrimination based on skin color or race didn\u2019t do anything to fix the systemic issues that started from slavery and only deepened over time.\n\nThere\u2019s also the extremely harmful myth of the model minority that plagues Asian-Americans which was created after WWII and the Japanese internment camps and used as a way to denigrate black people by comparing their plight to how Japanese-Americans supposedly rose up above their imprisonments. As if the discrimination that Asian-Americans felt in the US was as terrible as the hundreds of years of systemic dehumanization that black people faced.\n\nI am extremely hostile to the way Asian-Americans were and still are used as a tool by white conservatives to drive a wedge between minority groups. The lawsuit against Harvard was led by Edward Blum, whose agenda wasn\u2019t to help Asian-Americans, but to dismantle affirmative action. He had tried before in the past with Fisher vs the University of Texas which had the pretense of claiming Fisher didn\u2019t get into UT because she was a white woman; however, 168 black or Latino students with higher admissions scores than Fisher were also denied entry, and 42 white people and 5 black people with lower scores than her were admitted for whatever reason. In the Harvard lawsuit, Blum didn\u2019t care about the well-being of Asian-Americans at all; his only goal was to eradicate what he considered to be discrimination against white people.\n\nAffirmative action has actually benefitted many Asian-Americans, and polls show that most Asian-Americans have consistently supported it. In order to stop racial discrimination, Asian-Americans can\u2019t fall to a divide-and-conquer strategy pitting us against other minority groups. If we want to stop systemic racism, we should instead focus our efforts to make education accessible and equitable for all, including getting rid of the school to prison pipeline, stopping residential segregation, and increasing school funding. Affirmative action also has a much lesser impact than other groups such as athletics and legacy admissions, and yet those don\u2019t seem to spark as much outrage.",

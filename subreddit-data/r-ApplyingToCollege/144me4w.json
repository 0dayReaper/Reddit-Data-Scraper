But I used those skills to help me conduct financial analysis and valuation on publicly traded companies so is it worth mentioning that I took his course, granted is Isn\u2019t like Coursera or something where I could have gotten a certificate?",

            "comment": "Definitely worth mentioning in the context of showing how you acquired the skills for your EC. Damodaran is extremely well respected. Finance courses teach his stuff. The CFA (at least when I was sitting for the exams) used his stuff extensively. I teach and use his stuff in a corporate setting. I\u2019ve seen him cited/used to support/debunk various points in litigation. \n\nIn other words, incorporating that in some way is an indicator that you\u2019re curious and a couple steps ahead of the game compared to incoming finance students in strong programs.",

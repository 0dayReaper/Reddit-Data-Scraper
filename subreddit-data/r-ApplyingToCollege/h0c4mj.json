Since I read hella lot when I was younger, authors\u2019 books really influenced my style, and they\u2019ve definitely helped me become a better writer. I started writing earlier this month, and it\u2019s a long process, but you\u2019ll get there. As for the SAT (haven\u2019t taken it either, but did some ACTs and did well on them, so it\u2019s basically the same concept), practice tests are your best friend, particularly if you have timing issues like me. It\u2019s all about practice and experience, and we\u2019ve got a lotta time on our hands for both.",

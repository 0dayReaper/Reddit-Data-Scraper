    "postText": "I had a sub 2 GPA in high school, and after 2 years of community college, doing almost nothing special, I will be attending UCLA in the fall as a computer science transfer. I only got rejected from Berkeley. My GPA in community college wasn\u2019t spectacular, I got lots of Bs and a couple Ws and I had a 3.7 GPA when applying.\n\nI will answer any questions about the community college experience\n\n\nEDIT: I am from California, and I\u2019m lucky to have a great community college system here. I will say though, if you don\u2019t like the school you\u2019re going to and plan to transfer anyway, consider community college",

It\u2019s relatively affordable (though not in the cheapest area) and is all and all a really good school especially for transfers!! I would honestly suggest to anyone who is considering this route from out of state to look at the areas/schools/programs that they want and then go from there! Part of the affordability is what draws most people, but if you\u2019re not from Cali finding housing/employment in an area and then enrolling at the local CC is what I would suggest. I can list some of them out later :)",

You shouldn\u2019t be so humble about that - the acceptance rate for your major is quite low. \n\nBut in many states CC is a great way to cut college costs, take smaller classes and if you do well get into highly regarded schools. Especially in California. And for anyone interested in exploring how this would work, here are some links that show acceptance rates and GPA range by major at all UCs, as well as info on programs that can guarantee admission or boost your chances. https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/126z38b/for_the_many_amazing_california_students/",

I was going through some stuff in high school (long story), but I ended up getting a ton of Fs and eventually dropping out. Got a GED instead. I was never dumb, always did well on tests without studying, but I just never showed up to class or did the assignments. I was a pretty horrible student overall. Worked as a cook and later chef from ages 18-25. \n\nI went back to community college at 25 around the time covid hit and I had more times on my hands, worked hard, and earned a 4.0 over the span of about 5 semesters (including summers). Got exposed to a ton of great opportunities, and because class sizes are generally much smaller I was able to work on projects with a bunch of really cool professors. I was given several great recommendations, and I even had some opportunities to do paid research internships at a local 4 year university, organized by my community college. \n\nTransferred to a great engineering school for the exact program I wanted, and I\u2019ve held the top class rank since I started here a year and a half ago. My out of state tuition is fully covered through grants and scholarships, too. All said and done, I\u2019ve only had to pay out of pocket for a few semesters of community college, haven\u2019t needed any loans so far, either.\n\nUntil I started at community college I had always just told myself that college wasn\u2019t for me. I mean, it wasn\u2019t a stretch to think that way when I remembered my HS classmates taking AP everything and I was a dropout working over a fryer\u2026 Community college gave me a whole new outlook, gave me opportunities that I never would have even dreamed about back when I was failing high school, and my degree is going to say exactly the same thing as the students who got As in all those APs - it\u2019ll just have taken me a little bit longer.\n\nIt\u2019s not the best route for everybody. Of course, I\u2019d highly recommend *not* failing/dropping out of high school, as my life would have been significantly easier had I just been a better student from the start\u2026 but if you find yourself in a situation where you\u2019re unable to get into any of the schools/programs you wanted or something like that, community college can be a fantastic opportunity to start with a clean slate. It took plenty of work on my part, I won\u2019t discount that, but I\u2019ll be forever grateful for the opportunities afforded to me by my community college.",

My problem in high school was mostly that I just didn\u2019t care, couldn\u2019t bring myself to actually study or focus on the work for my classes. I never had any problems with understanding the materials being taught, I was failing because I never showed up.\n\nOnce I was a little bit older and had matured a bit from my goofy teenage years, (and I was paying for my community college classes myself, at first), I was only going to school because *I wanted to*, not because it was expected or forced. Of course my study habits did change, I put a lot of time into my classes, but personally I didn\u2019t have to put too much effort into developing new habits - that part just naturally fell into place once I had genuine motivation and cared about my grades.",

That clued me in and I didn't go further than that. The problem is that as I was making sure that I didn't sign up for the membership, I find that I have an account. \n\nSo my question is: did I accidently pay $75 or is having an account different from having a membership? I need a second opinion; I'm lowkey freaking out right now  ",

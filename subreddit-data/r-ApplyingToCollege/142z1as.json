    "postText": "Hi guys! Rising senior here. I signed up for Calculus 1 over the summer for AP Calculus AB credit to put on my high school transcript and I was just wondering if it looks good on my college apps that I took it over the summer? I wasn\u2019t going to take it at all, but with some teacher\u2019s encouragement, I decided to take it over the summer since I didn\u2019t have space in my senior year. I\u2019m trying to major in Microbiology which really includes Statistics(which i\u2019m taking my senior year), but I heard that AP Calc looks really nice when you\u2019re trying to major in STEM. Is this even a little correct? Regardless, I\u2019m still gonna take it to raise my GPA but thoughts?",

    "postText": "As the title suggests, I will be going from a predicted 95 to a 92 because in one marking period I got an 82 in one class because my teacher didn\u2019t put in all the grades. It was basically a free class where u can submit work whenever an still get full credit. Until now I thought that only the final final marking period grades matter, since grades don\u2019t reset every marking period, BUT NOOO, they don\u2019t. because of one 82, (99 for the next 2 marking periods) the average for that class becomes a 92, instead of a 99, which brings my total gpa down to less than 95!!\n\nMy grades for 6 marking periods are about like\n97, 95, 94, 94, 92, and 95 final which comes out to less than a 95!",

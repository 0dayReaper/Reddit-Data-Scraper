    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI know college rankings in general are often misleading and not always even helpful in determining what college to pick, but I was recently looking at the methodology Niche uses to calculate the \"Academics\" score. Im choose to highlight this specific ranking as the academics score is worth 40% of their total ranking, and many prospective students would base their collegiate choices off of primarily the quality of the academics. \n\nThe biggest issues (in my opinion, this is just my opinion) with the methodology are the factors chosen and how they are rated\n\nThe most weighted factor for calculating the academics score is... acceptance rate, at 16.9%\n\nIt is true that more competitive schools tend to have better academics, however, as many of us know, acceptance rate can be artificially decreased through *interesting* admissions policies (*cough* Northeastern *cough cough* Minerva *cough*), and a just because a school has a higher acceptance rate doesn't mean its academics are worse (some argue that many STEM focused schools actually have higher acceptance rates despite being competitive as many students interested in such schools tend to be more qualified and not just applying for clout). Furthermore, basing rankings off admissions scores could potentially create a positive feedback loop: relatively low acceptance rate leads to relatively high ranking, more students apply, acceptance rate goes down, ranking goes up, more students apply, until it eventually evens out. \n\nAdditionally at 8.4% wighting we have yield rate, which is not necessarily a indicator of good academics.\n\nSAT scores and National Merit Scholar students account for 12.8% of the academics grade, and while, yes, smarter students tend to go to schools with better academics, I would still argue that standardized test scores are not going to determine how good a schools professors and coursework are going to be. \n\nAt, also 8.4% we have diversity, and while I wholeheartedly believe that diversity is very important, does diversity impact the quality of academics and professors? Probably, but it just seems odd that they threw it in, id love to hear y'alls thoughts on the matter, I definitely don't have the full picture on this one.\n\nThis is all my opinion and I just wanted to share it. I do at least appreciate that Niche wights its Value ranking fairly high at 27.5% of the total ranking, which considers factors such as return on investment, net price, median earnings and loan stats, although lots of students that go to your typical highly ranking private schools like the ivys tend to have more wealthy parents which also comes with better networking opportunities not even considering college. Personally, Id like a college ranking site that only puts up raw data which you could then download as an xls file, sorta like the world bank ([https://data.worldbank.org](https://data.worldbank.org)).\n\nI would love to hear what y'all think!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's niches official college academics ranking methodology: [https://www.niche.com/about/methodology/best-college-academics/](https://www.niche.com/about/methodology/best-college-academics/)",

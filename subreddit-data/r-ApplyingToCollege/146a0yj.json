    "postText": "Good Morning everyone,\n\nI hope you guys are having a wonderful day. So, my situation is that my school uses a quarter system meaning that I only take 4 classes and after 2 quarters is like I completed those 4 classes in a year. However, I took 3 AP classes and they are full year. The class title changes to Pre- or Honor in the second and third quarters. For example, I took AP Lang, and my 2nd and 3rd quarter was called Honor Writing Seminar but we were still in an AP class. Now my transcript has 4 grades for an AP class. Will these honor classes count towards the UC GPA when they recalculate it? I am worried and disappointed because, in my APUSH class, the teacher was a terrible person, therefore I got 3 As and 1 C and they are all weighted so it is affecting my GPA so much. I am going to apply for a chemistry major so history is not even my thing.",

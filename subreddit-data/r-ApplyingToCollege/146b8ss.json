    "postText": "If I have autism and I am about 3 years more immature than my technical age (approximately mentally 14 right now), can a school deny me even if I\u2019m very brilliant in school? I just can\u2019t talk good and stim a lot which could be a classroom distraction, as well as my service dog. I am a year ahead in my studies at high school, and I have no problem doing any work given to me, I\u2019m just worried my disability will bar me from a good future.",

I think it is possible colleges might not accept you, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a dealbreaker in admissions especially if framed well + you probably wouldn\u2019t want to attend a school that would reject you over something you can\u2019t change.",

            "comment": "Rejecting you because of a disability would be illegal.  However, if you don't disclose the disability, and they conclude that you're a less desirable applicant than some people with slightly worse academic credentials because of weaker social skills, that could hurt you.  I'm not sure what happens if you disclose a disability, and they penalize you for a lack of abilities related to that disability.  Reasonable accommodations are required, and if they think a certain level of social maturity is necessary for success at the school, in contributing to the campus environment and in later life, it may be allowable to consider -- not the disability diagnosis, but the particular skills they expect that you don't have. You should discuss this with a real expert on the topic to get a real understanding of your legal rights here, before deciding whether to disclose the disability at the time of application.  If you don't disclose the disability, and apply to somewhere that requires interviews, it is likely to hurt you, but it might also come out in recommendation letters or in which extracurriculars you have done.\n\nYou can ask for the accommodations after admission.\n\nAlso, there are some excellent colleges and universities that do admission and even merit-based scholarships entirely on academic records.",

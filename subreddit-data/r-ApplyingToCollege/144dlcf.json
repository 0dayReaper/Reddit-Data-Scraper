People tell me keep an open mind about the college I\u2019m going to but the degree I want isn\u2019t offered here and the program is kind of new. Im doing engineering by the way. \n\nIn college, I don\u2019t plan on socializing that much and just focusing on studying, this is one of things I\u2019m excited for in college. I just really want to study. \n\nTo my main point, every year in high school I had at least 1 B+, max 2. I had a lot of family stuff going on that impacted my grades in this way. I plan applying to UVA, UCLA, and Virginia tech. \n\nIf I get close to a 4.0 in college, will my B\u2019s matter as much in transferring?",

Are you planning on doing something about them if someone says they matter?",

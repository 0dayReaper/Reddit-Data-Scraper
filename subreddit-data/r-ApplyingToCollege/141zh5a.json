    "postText": "I want to be a STEM major at a top school and am confused about the subject combinations for my A levels. I've seen that colleges consider AICE rigorous but considering I want to take Physics, Chemistry and Biology it seems way too hard to have to take subjects from arts and humanities plus global perspective as well to get the certificate. Is the certificate really worth it or can I stick to Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Math and English? ",

    "postText": " \n\nI completed my first two years of high school in India, but due to Covid, I had to switch to an online school called Acellus Academy. Initially, Acellus had a good reputation, but later it faced allegations of sexism and racism. During my senior year at Acellus, they refused to accept the credits from my previous two years of high school. As a result, I had to complete 20 credits in my senior year, while I had only completed six credits in my junior year. After graduating from Acellus, I started my first year of high school in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I have a decent college GPA (3.8) and I'm considering transferring to the University of Michigan or the University of Wisconsin.\n\nWill my unconventional background make it difficult for me to transfer to a good school? Could it potentially hurt my application?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any guidance or advice.",

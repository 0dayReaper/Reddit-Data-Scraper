    "postText": "Everything has gone to complete shit. I won\u2019t get into details, but everything, mental health, physics health, social life, professional relationships, family, future goals, friendships, has all crumbled because I couldn\u2019t get into any of my top choice schools. It\u2019s so funny. I was on top of the world just three months ago. Now I\u2019m struggling just to wake up. I know people will say \u201cjust don\u2019t be a pussy and keep going\u201d but I\u2019m burned out, completely. I have to deal with so much right now that I just can\u2019t deal with it anymore. And there is literally not a single person I can turn to.",

You're doing better than a lot of people.\n\n3) If not, then start thinking about your options: gap year, job, CC, apply to rolling/spring admissions. There are really great universities like Pitt that are still taking applicants, since they are 100% rolling admissions.",

I think you should make an appointment with a mental health clinic or therapist pronto.\n\nAlso, I think you need to recognize that your focus on getting into a top school was not constructive. Focusing on larger goals, such as discovering a true area of academic focus that you love, becoming involve in your community in things you enjoy and will make you feel connected to others, developing a healthy lifestyle that includes enjoyable outdoor activities and hobbies, etc, is far more important. These things can be easily done while attending a community college btw, and lead to great success in life.",

Asssuming not, how.you rebound from disappointment is a reflection of and maker of character.  If you are set for school in the fall, try to put your summer to good use getting your mind right for the challenge ahead (did you know all colleges are tough if you do them right?).\n\nso get up, exercise (as good as taking meds, some studies say), get a job, and you will start to feel better.  Look into what is good about your future school and start to look ahead, not behind.  This will pass.",

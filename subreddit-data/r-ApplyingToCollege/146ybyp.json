    "postText": "I\u2019m currently enrolled in an AP focused school, but my home school only provides the IB program. I already stayed at the hime school for freshman. Should I sign back to the IB school, or go to AP? Teachers at the IB school seem to be lenient and easy with teaching the material (based on what I\u2019ve seen my friends talk about\u2026I have helped a friend with doing some essays for her English HL or SL class). Meanwhile, the other school already is already difficult in the regular classes (depending on teacher or subject, I heard the science department at the AP school is terrible). However, the AP school has a lot of clubs compared to the IB school. \n\nI\u2019ve talked about my problem to my IB school counselor and she said that the university I want to go to, UCLA, prefers IB. She also said that all the students with IB diploma went to a really good university. I was thinking of trying out AP for 10th grade and then either staying at the AP school or transferring back to the IB school (if IB is better). My family member instead advised me to just take all the easy classes and do dual enrollment.",

    "postText": "These quest bridge scholars are visiting Disney (Tokyo which is an expensive flight) , going on multiple vacations, paying for expensive school trips, getting brand new cars, ect. Of course I dont know their financial circumstances, but Ive been told as a family of 4 with ~64k income and little assets that I would be auto-rejected for quest-bridge. I'm a bit confused on how the whole quest bridge thing works I guess \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05.\n\nI don't mean this as a dig at the scholars btw, its just a bit confusing. Could anyone clarify how Quest Bridge works regarding income or?",

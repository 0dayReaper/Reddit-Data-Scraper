    "postText": "On college applications there are the options to apply either as a transfer, freshman, or international student.\n\nI\u2019m looking to graduate high-school with a diploma as well as an Associates of Science through a Dual Enrollment program. If I wanted to further my education at another college to get a bachelors, do I apply to that college either as a freshman or a transfer student (despite already attaining an Associates)?",

In Florida, this is a thing and I know kids who weren't admitted as freshman to UF and FSU but who were admitted as transfers two weeks after being rejected.  Note:  students had pre requisites for major complete as part of their AA earned in High school.\n\nConversely, Va has GAA that guarantee admission to UVA, William and Mary with AA  3.4,3.6 gpa respectively.  They require 24 credits after high school to use the GAA end explicitly exclude DE students. \n\nSo check where you are applying what your options are should the worst happen.",

    "postText": "How much of an effect does your senior year course load and grades have on college admissions?  \nIf you apply normally, do they get to see your first semester senior year grades while reviewing your application? If so, is this factored into the GPA and viewed with more consideration than sophomore year grades?  \nDoes it really matter if my senior year course load is as rigorous or not? Like is it included into this holistic evaluation as a pretty considerable factor or it's kind of like a slight \"recommendation\" so you don't get rescinded?",

High rigor is recommended for top schools and good performance is necessary. Junior/senior year matter more than freshman/sophomore. Also, yes, they do see your first semester senior year grades when you apply.",

They would rather, for example, that you had a 3.8 GPA freshman and sophomore year in decent classes and 3.9 in junior and senior year in hard classes than vice versa. I do think that it is not all about senior year, though, as junior year is an entire year as opposed to the one semester or quarter they may see of your senior year.",

Out of the ED/EA round, you could be deferred to RD. \n\nIf you apply RD, they will see your first term grades and course schedule for the entire year. \n\nIf you end up on the waitlist after RD, they will see nearly your entire senior year grades and course schedule.",

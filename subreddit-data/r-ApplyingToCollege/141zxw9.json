    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm a homeschooled junior in high school right now and I've been doing community college classes. I'm trying to get into T20s but I'm super nervous and I'm wondering like how impressive my 3 associate degrees will seem. I(will) have 4.0s on all of them. \n\nI did them just because I loved learning more, and before I knew it I was basically there so I spent the last couple semesters finishing them(i'll have math and econ done this sem). \n\nWhat I want to know is how would it look on an application? Would it stand out as something amazing that's super rare or would it just be like a checkmark?  I mean like, I doubt anyone else really has 3 Associate Degrees especially with 4.0s, right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMajor is CS but I'm doing degrees in CS, Math, and Econ.",

Most of what everyone has said here in this thread is so far from what I've seen go down in adcoms lol.\n\nIt's interesting if they are three different associates degrees in different subjects. There are no checkmarks or whatever, but if you package this right, it can really make a good lift in your application to be more compelling. The only difficulty here is that you're homeschooled, so it's a little different. There are a lot of homeschooled students who take a variety of CC classes, so you might read as a typical profile. It's all in the packaging of WHY you took these. If you have an extending story where you use the knowledge someway, that helps a lot.",

They're always interesting people to meet who do these things in high school, I'm sure. I'm saying it's not impressive because I see kids like this every year; none of it is something that necessarily impresses, to me or my colleagues. What it does do is give us pause if the student has a well articulated reason.\n\nUnless you're calling out the fact that it depends on the region like a student being from a rural area, then yeah, it can be more impressive. So in such a case, I would amend my statement to \"It's not that impressive, depending on the circumstances.\" But even so, we're still talking about a homeschooled student, who, as I've said, typically come in with multiple CC classes, even some associates, and therefore have similar profiles to others. What matters to us for the homeschooled students is their articulation of why.",

Otherwise, it starts to become the typical kid who does a shit ton of research in hopes of getting into college. But being able to articulate the why behind the research, the why behind the three AAs, etc, can be compelling.\n\nThere's also the weird part is that this student is homeschooled, and there's a large chunk of homeschooled students who also do CC courses. So in the end, this student might still not be compelling because of how similar of a profile they are to the rest. Regions can also be a factor (rural vs urban area). And then of course different schools might see things different depending on the culture of the school and the admissions office.",

If to me, I'm not saying homeschooling isn't a path. I'm also not implying nor saying that everyone's path has to be the same. I see a good chunk of homeschooled students each year in the applicant pool, and each year they tend to have a number of CC classes. It's true they generally have a load of activities, but a student who has a bunch of CC classes and a lot of activities is still rather typical in a pool of homeschooled student. It's not that compelling. Plus, I'm only speaking to the fact that these 3 AAs can be interesting, but a reason those with a bunch of CC classes are denied that I've seen usually is because of the fact that the profiles of homeschooled students still have a bunch of CC classes. What makes it distinct? Normally the reason why.",

Fundamentally, we will still look for impact. Not many homeschooled students have that. A normal HS student, for example, might be student body president or something, which shows some level of impact, but you don't have that option. So do something you love doing, but shows you would be interesting to have on a school campus, that you would be a contributing member to our campus.\n\nThe other thing about it is that you have to stand up strong to the broader admitted pool.

My gpa and degree especially at my age(40) is a sign that I'm not afraid to put myself in a position to learn a new thing, I'm resourceful, disciplined and when given a specific objective I'll work diligently at it. When I said this during my interview they really liked hearing that. So you can just post it and when they ask why you may try to use some kind of explanation like this. \nI find that people online like to say \"GPA don't matter\", \"certifications don't matter\", \"C's get you degrees\", etc. I think it's because excelling is difficult and the vast majority of people do ok without the accolades, but these things absolutely matter if not as a proof of intelligence as proof that you're a hard worker. \nAlso when you're intelligent it'll come across very quickly, the same as if you're not. What people looking at this stuff want to know is whether you have the soft skills and wisdom to use all the data and information you've accumulated in a productive way and not only as a fact spewing machine.\nTldr: yes it matters but you have to have the right angle when selling the idea why it's a plus in your case.\n\nEdit: I realize after re-reading your post that you're applying to college and not a job, my mistake. Three degrees will probably not help you by themselves but they'll look at each class you passed already and not put you in similar ones, so you'll get credit per class if applicable.

This summer be sure to solidify your extracurricular. You need things that you do because you enjoy them and things that you do for the community (even better if they are related or connected). You'll need something that demonstrates leadership, a leadership role or founding of a club can demonstrate that but you can also do something that demonstrates leadership without officially being a leadership role. A couple of people I know have done things like teach seminars to younger students or cimplete projects for places that they volunteer at. As a homeschooler, you should have plenty of opportunities to demonstrate community involvement and leadership (at least if your homeschool community is like mine was). Please DM me if you have any questions, I'd love to help.\n\n\n All in all, congrats on the associates! It shows a lot of hard work, dedication, and motivation.",

All those classes will look impressive though, especially at a 4.0. \n\nSomething to be careful about, however \u2014 applying with an associates degree makes you a transfer student rather than an applying high school student. This can really change thing and mess up a lot of programs. In order to actually receive your associates degrees, you will have to have actually attended and been enrolled in university. This makes you a transfer student from a community college, not an applying high school student. Source: I did this myself. It can really mess up financial aid, scholarships, and makes it so most programs (like bs/md, and many other combined degree programs for example) are not available to you, so just be careful with that. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily good or bad, but the course load looks good.\n\nI really want to stress how big of a deal this is because this can seriously mess things up if you\u2019re not prepared to enter as a transfer. Just keep this in mind. I personally would not recommend it whatsoever, unless you are going to a school with an agreement with that community college. Some of your credits may not be accepted, but more importantly, being a transfer may limit your options, make your experience more difficult, and make applications harder. You really want to be careful with this.",

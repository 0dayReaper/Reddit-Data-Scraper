    "postText": "hello, please help me decide. I just got off the Tufts waitlist, and I\u2019m already committed to ND. I don\u2019t know if I should stay with ND or go to Tufts. Tbh, don\u2019t know differences between programs since I haven\u2019t researched Tufts well bec I didn\u2019t expect to get accepted.\n\npersonal context\n- queer lesbian poc on the west coast\n- interested in pursuing art, music, engineering, comp sci. currently undecided but will pursue STEM and the arts\n- very negative experience in HS: PWI and homophobic, had basically zero social life\n- have mental issues (anxiety and depression)\n- low-mid income\n- costs are affordable for both, it is out of the question\n- hoping to live in California or East Coast when I have a job\n- planning to transfer out of ND after a year to an ivy/usc\n\nND pros:\n- better prestige, alumni network, resources, connections\n- I have academic flexibility \n- sister already goes here so its easier to transition\n- cheaper travel than tufts\n- nice dorms (will have a newer one bec accommodations)\n- will have an easier time transferring out given name brand\n\nND cons:\n- religious\n- homophobic, smaller queer dating pool\n- less diverse than tufts(?)\n- location sucks ass, in the middle of nowhere\n- worse art program\n- not one for the football culture\n\nTufts pros:\n- location is better, I like proximity to boston\n- arts program is better\n- student body will probs be more liberal \u2014&gt; easier to be queer\n- still a T40, so it\u2019s a good school no matter what\n\nTufts cons:\n- not as prestigious/ranked high as ND\n- bad gym facilities\n- harder travel costs since I live farther away\n- food slightly worse(?)\n\nI only have a week to decide. As of rn, it seems that ND is better academic fit and could lead to better opportunities after graduating even if I have to deal with a conservative/religious campus. Tufts would feel like a better social fit, but idk if I\u2019m stabbing myself in the back bec I might not have the same academic opportunities. Thanks!",

ND is a great school, sport culture etc. definitely not seen as more prestigious in the Northeast vs Tufts. If you feel like you\u2019d be better with your sibling around that counts for a lot. I\u2019d go into the choice without assuming the transfer aspect. Choose one that you can see being there 4 yrs.",

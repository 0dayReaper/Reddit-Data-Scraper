    "postText": "I'm in a bit of a weird situation regarding my education. Currently, I live in Italy but it's only because my dad works in the United States army and was stationed here. I'm just now finishing grade 10 and I'm really not sure what to do. All my classmates are going back to their home state and applying to colleges there, but I don't really have a \"home state\". I mean my parents own a property in the states which would get me a reduced tuition but they don't want me going that far away as they'll be living in Italy. So, my options are kind of limited because any time I try to look at courses for Radiology Techs (Field im interested in) I barely find courses that are applicable to that in English, and to add on, I'm equally confused with AP's. So far I haven't taken any but I know that all European highschools are an extra year than American Highschools so AP's will help me, but which ones should I take? Does it even matter? I'm basically throwing away my whole sports life because I'm taking 3 AP's next year and I'm not even sure if they're beneficial. I don't want to specifically go to college in Italy, just anywhere in Europe would be good. I'm very stuck as you can see, any, and I mean any help would be more than appreciated. Thank you for reading",

However, if you're planning to enter a field with certification and plan to live/work in the United States, then it may be beneficial to attend school in the U.S.  You'll need to convince your parents that your realizing your career goals is \"worth\" living far from home.",

            "comment": "If you're ever going back to US in the end you should go to US. English taught bachelors in Italy are pretty sparse - i doubt there is a radiology course in English in Italy.  \nAs someone else said, UK could be a nice middle ground. It might be a little more pricy compared to the rest of Europe, though  \n\nYes, you need one of these curriculums to study in Europe (UK, Netherlands, Belgium, France etc): IB/AP/A levels.  \nTake at least 3 APs (or 4) in 9th 10th and 11th grade and make sure one of them is Calculus (preferably BC) if you want to study anything tangentially related to maths. If your current school doesn't offer APs you can take them in another school that offers it.  \nEuropean high schools are not an extra year, but they're academically challenging which makes American highschool diploma ineligible by itself.  \n\nFor Italy you just need SAT/ACT, and to be fair Italian college admissions are not competitive (maybe medicine exception - if you want medicine you should definitely go to the country you'll live in for the rest of your life)",

They just talk about UK every once and a while because they're most familiar with UK, their neighbor on the other side of the pond. And to compare college applications  \nIt doesn't make sense for an American to apply outside: their degree in Europe or somewhere else will be looked at less favorably by an American employer (unless it's Oxbridge kind of deal) when they come back to US. If they stay, they'll be paid less than their American collegues, and they'll double taxed (unless the country they live in has a tax deal with US). They also have to be fully fluent in another language for the rest of their lives, which many Americans would prefer not to  \n\nSome suggestions for engineering:  \nTU Delft, TU Eindhoven etc. many universities in Netherlands that offer English bachelors for Engineering. r/studyinthenetherlands can give you some insight into Dutch universities  \nEcole Polytechnique in Paris has an English taught maths-focused CS major, pretty prestigious university in France afaik. They have an exchange program in the third year at UCL, USC and the like  \nPolitecnico di Torino and some other Italian universities are pretty good, but their English-taught programs might be... a little less than their Italian-taught counterparts (Italy doesn't have the best English speaking ratio)  \n\nThe thing about some universities in Western Europe (Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium...) is, they're pretty much all public and they all give pretty decent education. So \"top university\" title doesn't mean a lot in Europe. But many don't have English bachelors unfortunately.  \nAnd lise diplomas\u0131 is not accepted pretty much anywhere so you should take AP/IB/A levels etc. to be eligible. Typically 3 or 4 APs, one of one must be Calculus BC for engineering  \nCanada has pretty decent universities as well, \"top\" universities like UToronto, UBC, Waterloo (for engineering). And you can get your permanent residency smoothly after graduation  \nHKUST, NUS etc. are pretty prestigious, if you're open to study in Asia. It'll be a pretty different experience than American colleges though.",

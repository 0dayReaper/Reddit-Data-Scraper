            "comment": "Course load difficulty is evaluated in the context of your school. If your school only offers 12 AP classes, and your peers are taking 8, then your courseload will be considered very difficult. If your school offers 36 AP classes, and your peers are all taking 20 APs, then your courseload would be considered on the easy side. Taking Calc AB will be evaluated differently based on whether or not Calc BC was offered at your school and how many people took it.\n\nBased on the particular classes you\u2019ve chosen, it looks like a good mix of easy and hard APs. AOs would get the impression that you\u2019re passionate in the humanities and social sciences, not that you intentionally picked easy classes.",

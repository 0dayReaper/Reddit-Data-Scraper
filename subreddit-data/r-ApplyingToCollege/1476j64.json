    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising senior who has a much lower GPA due to my freshman year. I have a 4.15 W and a 3.45 UW. I\u2019m planning on mentioning that my freshman year was at home due to COVID and I could not at all focus sitting at my computer rather than at school. I\u2019m planning on applying for Computer Engineering and I have a 33 ACT. UMich is a dream school for me so I am hoping that my transcript will somewhat make up for my low GPA as I have taken the hardest courses allowed per year and 11 mainly STEM AP\u2019s. I also hope Multivariabld Calc will help me here. Besides my freshman year My weighted GPA has fluctuated between 4.4-4.78 on an upward trend. Strictly from an academic aspect, is there anything else I can do? The cumulative GPA is below average for many of the schools i\u2019m applying to.",

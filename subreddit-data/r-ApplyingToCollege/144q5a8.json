    "postText": "In my high school, the most advanced math course available for juniors is AP Precalculus. However, I've heard from people outside of my school that juniors usually take AP Calculus BC if they want a shot at getting into prestigious universities. The issue is that I can't go beyond AP Precalculus unless I sign up for the Precalculus Honors course at my local community college. This course would give me the prerequisites for AP Calculus BC, but I'm not sure if it's worth doing.\r  \n\r  \nSome students at my school say that taking the community college course is unnecessary. They argue that since I'm already in the highest math class offered by our high school, it won't negatively affect my university application. However, considering my intent of majoring Aerospace Engineering, I understand the importance of demonstrating strong math skills.\r  \n\r  \nI'm currently weighing the options of taking Precalculus Honors at the community college and then enrolling in AP Calculus BC during my junior year. I could stick with AP Precalculus at my high school to boost my weighted GPA; but will taking Precalculus Honors over the summer actually do anything?",

We have no idea how it affects your chances at getting into a \"prestigious\" school.\n\nYou are evaluated in the context of your school. Stop listening to those who don't have the same situation as you. How can you be expected to take AP Calc BC if it isn't even offered?\n\nWhat you are expected to do is to challenge yourself with the resources at your disposal and to do well in those challenges. If you are pushing yourself and doing well, then I see no reason to worry.",

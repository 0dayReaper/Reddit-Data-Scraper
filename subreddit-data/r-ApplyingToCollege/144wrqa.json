                    "comment": "I would say that the transition definitely differs depending where you went to school, plus what you\u2019re planning on studying in college. In my experience, people from competitive school areas (i.e. Chicago, Bay Area, DC) struggled less than those who had more conventional high school experiences. At USC, I\u2019ve definitely noticed that my friends in STEM (esp. engineering) struggle a lot more than I do in arts/humanities. \n\nFor general advice, I would say to stay organized with whatever system works for you - for me, Google Calendar is super helpful to schedule blocks in my day to accomplish certain tasks (i.e. specific hw assignments, studying, and even making time to meet friends and go to club meetings). Other than that, I would say it\u2019s super important to make sure that classes and grades aren\u2019t getting to your head too much, because freshman and sophomore year are probably the best times to make friends and meet tons of cool people. Social life is a big contributor to overall mental well-being, and having a good balance has definitely contributed to my academic success. So, when you\u2019re bogged down from studying too hard for an upcoming test, don\u2019t stress too much about it and maybe try taking breaks to get dinner with some people before going back to studying! It\u2019s great to find what makes you feel relaxed, especially being in a new environment away from home.",

I am actually FGLI, and a big reason why I committed to USC was because of their commitment to free tuition for students who have a family income of &lt;80k. \n\nAmong the clubs that I hang out in/the circles that I am a part of, I would say that there are some snooty rich kids who have little consideration for the fact that others don\u2019t have as much money, and who scoff at lower-income students. I have to work 20 hours/week to support myself alongside school and I have definitely had people ask me why I had a job, because it seemed unnecessary and unfathomable to them. I have mainly heard some pretty cringy stories from my friends in the business school about the disparity between rich/ avg. income kids.\n\nWhat is funny and something that I did not consider before is that USC would be full of a lot of rich kids who are kind of embarrassed of their family\u2019s wealth, so they go to lengths to hide it because a lot of people at USC make fun of the rich kids that flaunt it. If you want to rush Greek, I will say that a few frats and sororities do ask about parental income when you are applying\u2026 But honestly the best parties I\u2019ve been to are from random clubs and houses. A lot of people (incl. myself) like to host parties at their houses that are more like kick-backs than ragers, and it can be a really nice way to have some drinks and chat around the fire pit. At USC, we like to have fun, and I\u2019d say the philosophy is definitely work hard, play hard. However, as a not-at-all rich kid that still parties a few weekends out of the month, I would say that it can be a lot of fun.",

As you progress through USC, it seems that a lot of people save money through their summer/remote internships. My freshman year I didn\u2019t have a job for a bit and it was kind of hard to be able to do social fun things with people all of the time because of money (it\u2019s hard to go out to dinner every weekend!!!). However, there are some plans that I would have to cancel out of money concerns and some that I would keep because I knew that this was a good way of making friends and meeting new people my first semester. Overall, it\u2019s all about balance. I strongly feel that I have found my niche at USC and the only things I really spend my \u201cfun\u201d money on now are occasional dates with my partner, getting coffee like once a week, 2-3 dinners with friends per month, and permits to go hiking and camping all around California! for me getting outdoors more was a fantastic, low-cost way to meet new people, strengthen friendships, and get to know myself better in a way that I hadn\u2019t before college.\nALSO, if you qualify for Work Study please do apply for food stamps! Makes life after freshman year infinitely easier.",

                    "comment": "No problem! \n\n1) I actually chose USC because I applied as an Architecture major, and their SoA has a really good reputation as well as amazing study abroad opportunities. Another factor was that they offer free tuition to students whose families make $80k/year or less, and that was a pretty good financial aid offer compared to what I got from other schools. \n\nSomething that shocked me when I came to campus was honestly how smart everyone else is. It\u2019s crazy to be in the top 5-10% of your high school class and then come to college and realize that almost everyone at USC came from the top 1-10% too. It can be intimidating to speak up in discussion-based classes at first because of how insightful others\u2019 reflections and comments are, but over time it will get easier! \n\n2) Ok, so my partner is an Electrical Engineering major and my best friend is a BUAD major. For my partner, she has definitely had a hard time getting used to studying EE. This is mainly because freshmen and sophomores in Viterbi are faced with a lot of weed-out classes that are kind of meant to push students to stick it out with engineering or quit. Also, in EE, students are expected to begin with Linear Algebra and then take MVC the following semester, which is a bit unconventional. A lot of the time you will be relying on curves to get your grades up, because it\u2019s not uncommon for the raw average scores in Marshall or Viterbi classes to be in the 50s, 60s, or 70s. The curve will be more forgiving depending on the professor/course. Overall, there are a lot of engineering clubs and she has found a group within the EE majors that she likes to hang out with/do labs and projects with, and she has a great research position because of CURVE. \n\nFor my friend in Marshall, he is not the biggest studier but he does get good grades. From what I have seen, as long as you don\u2019t slack off too much, your grades will be fine. Marshall purposely gives students light course loads so that they are encouraged to pursue a minor or two, and/or a double major, if they wish. The professors in Marshall have some fantastic connections if you are good at networking, and it honestly sets you up for success even if you\u2019re not the best at networking. They host lots of speaker events and clinics to help students gain perspective on the business world outside of college, and USC is a school that top consulting firms and other big business companies like to pick from often. \n\n3) I have been on quite the roller coaster with my major/deciding what I want to do with my life, but at the beginning of my sophomore year I settled on a triple major in Comparative Literature, French, and Italian. A lot of people clown on me for studying humanities, but I have made extremely good connections in my field, and I am hoping to do a Fulbright ETA after graduation, with the end goal of getting a PhD in Comparative Literature to teach on the university level. Given that I started my journey in Architecture, I would encourage you to be brave and see where your studies take you. What planted the seed in my head to study language and literature was one Italian course I took my first semester for fun, and now I\u2019m here. Don\u2019t be afraid to pursue new ideas and try out classes in subjects you are even a tiny bit interested in! \n\n4) I haven\u2019t gotten the opportunity to do any internships in my current field yet, but I did have an architecture internship my freshman year. I am currently looking into publishing internships to start as a remote intern this fall! \n\nI have not met with a career advisor in person, but they have really useful online resources that I\u2019ve used in making a better resume and CV. I highly recommend looking at their website! \n\n5) Yes, it is definitely possible to double-major across schools. However, note that you will have to apply to each separate school (unless it\u2019s Dornsife CAS). Given that you\u2019re interested in engineering and business, you might want to consider the Computer Science and Business Administration program offered between Viterbi and Marshall! It\u2019s a combined B.S. degree. \n\n6) Like I said earlier, USC gives good financial aid if you are lower-income, but I know that a lot of my middle-class and upper middle-class friends have been kind of screwed over by the financial aid office. There are always loans that can be taken out and I work to support myself alongside school while maintaining good grades, so there is always a way to work around it. For merit, I know a lot of people can automatically claim a half-tuition scholarship if you got National Merit from the PSAT. Other than that, if you apply by USC\u2019s early deadline, you automatically enter yourself into the pool to be considered for merit scholarships, whereas if you apply for the regular deadline, you miss out on that opportunity. They offer a full-tuition merit scholarship, half-tuition merit scholarship, and quarter-tuition merit scholarship. I did not receive any of these, but I do have a small merit scholarship every year on top of my financial aid. Additionally, there are TONS of scholarships you can apply for as a continuing student. \n\n7) The social scene is honestly pretty great! I think that almost everyone ends up finding their niche at USC, and a lot of that depends on the clubs that you end up being in. For me, I\u2019m in both student-run outdoors clubs (member and on EBoard), and also the rock climbing team. Most of my friends have come from these clubs and the events that we have, but I have also made friends in my classes. As you stick with a major over time, you start seeing the same faces and it\u2019s easy to become friends (or at least friendly) with them!",

I would agree with the other commenter that being in-state vs. OOS does not affect your chances of getting into USC in the same way that it does for the UCs, because USC is a private school and the UCs are public. As for being 16, I would say that as long as you meet all of the criteria to apply to college, you should be fine! I have heard from people who come into college younger that it can be difficult, because there are a lot of things that you\u2019ll need a parent to sign a random waiver for if you\u2019re under 18 (i.e. using the gyms on campus, field trips, USC-sponsored events and parties, etc.) However, I don\u2019t think that any of that poses a significant possibility of being affected negatively, I think that if you\u2019re 16 and manage to get into USC 2 years ahead of your peers, that\u2019s so awesome! It really shows that you\u2019re a go-getter and that you have the potential to thrive socially and academically at USC.

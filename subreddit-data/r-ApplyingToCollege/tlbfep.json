My essay was pretty strong and I scored pretty high on a national exam, but I\u2019m not too sure if that actually mattered too much cuz my twin brother scored pretty low and also got in. My high school GPA was like 92.7 and my SAT was 1510 but I\u2019m an Asian male so that\u2019s pretty bad, especially since my math score was 760 and I applied STEM. I\u2019d like to say I got in cuz of strong application, but I think my brother and I got really lucky with EA so I\u2019d definitely EA for sure. I took a fair amount of APs, starting in 9th grade, although in later years I really screwed up on them (got like 2 on calc bc and physics c electric, 3 on stats and physics c mechanics, and some other bad scores I can\u2019t remember anymore) so idk if they helped me\n\nIdk if this will help u much but hopefully u get in, good luck.

I am so nervous \ud83d\ude02 but honestly that idea that you have to be a leader to get a good schoolarship is a lie. I am a very introverted person and would kill to just not talk at all, but still got a few good schoolarships. I am currently enrolling in the aerospace/ mecanical engineering field, and the extracurricular activities I did where: robotics, code club, chess club, German, violin and piano. Don't just take many extracurriculars, take the ones that have a weigh to your application. So I would recommend robotics a lot(many colleges have complimented me for it) and a language if you can ^^ also don't forget ap classes. If you want to mayor in CS please take AP calculus. I took it, and it's so helpful for you and your application",

Many of you will be rejected for grad schools, jobs, promotions, marriage proposals\u2026. Welcome to the real world. Depending on the school you go to, you\u2019re not going to be the smartest one there. Your parents will no longer be able to protect you from disappointment, heartache, and the unfairness of the world. You have to get in the ring and fight. Just be aware you\u2019re going to get knocked down often. Try not to get knocked out. But, if you do, pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again. We\u2019ve all been there.",

When we started to read out the letters, he showed us how sharp he still really is by just listening to the tone of the first line and giving us a lecture on what the decision really meant amd what, as an Oxonian he knows about the 20 top universities that were applied to for 2022. \n\nAnd that we needed to focus on the ones that admitted and gave a decent scholarship ... to move forward strongly.  \n\nAlso: any university that boasts 60000 applicants (looking at you columbia.edu) in a rejection letter need to fire their admissions director and send him/her home with a copy of Stanford's rejection letter which was really really well written and impressed us all. \n\nSo, learned that even the process of rejection says a lot about a school's quality IMHO.",

    "postText": "i just took the SAT for the third time about a week ago and i know that i didn\u2019t do as well as i hoped because i didn\u2019t have a lot of time to study. i think that if i was able to retake it a fourth time, in august, and i studied more leading up to it, i\u2019d definitely get a better score but i have heard that colleges don\u2019t typically like when students take it more than three times and i\u2019m wondering how accurate that is? and if it is accurate, if it\u2019s still worth it to try again because my scores aren\u2019t that good?\n\nfor reference these are the colleges i\u2019m most interested in:\nduke, unc chapel hill, uva, nc state, clemson (they all superscore)\n\nand these were my scores:\n1st time: 1350 (740 EBRW, 610 Math)\n2nd time: 1410 (750 EBRW, 660 Math)\n3rd time: haven\u2019t gotten the score back yet but i\u2019m predicting somewhere in between 1300 and 1400",

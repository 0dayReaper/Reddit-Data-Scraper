Is there anything that I need to include when emailing or should I keep emailing like any other institution until I hear a response back?\n\nEdit: I have research experience at a pretty good research university",

Going to a T10 to do \"research\" does not somehow guarantee your acceptance to that university as well.\n\nTake a look at the universities in your local area. Find professors who's work you find genuinely interesting. Focus on doing high quality research and stop chasing the vanity of a fancy name.\n\nAnd yes, just email like you would at \"any other institution\". T10s are not some super secret research haven with different protocols lmfao. They do research just like everyone else.",

I wanted to join a second lab at a particular T10 because it has a very interesting lab relating to aerospace engineering (the area that I want to pursue). This current university doesn\u2019t have that focused of a lab when it comes to aerospace.",

    "postText": "Acceptance rates might be weird, like the applicant pool of one college and the other might vary a lot.  \nI don't like using median scores because my academics are pretty much ok for almost all colleges. And standardized tests nowadays don't mean as much at admissions, test-optional also skews the median test scores  \nWhat metric can highlight the admission difficulty the best?\n\nI was also wondering if I should treat a 10% acceptance rate at a LAC (WASP + many others) means the same thing as a 10% acceptance rate at other colleges (T25 + more).  \n\nAnd do schools like Northeastern (not completely sure but I think Tufts and Tulane has a similar thing going on) that are known to deflate acceptance rates actually got a lot more competitive or does the acceptance rate just show more unqualified applicants applied there?",

For WASP schools I\u2019d compare yourself to the cds, it\u2019s especially hard to compare their acceptance rate to public schools based on their differences",

            "comment": "Ok what I would say about this is you can't really compare.  You can create a balance list.  Identify some true safeties (your stats above the 75%, acceptance rate 75% or preferably higher) and roll the dice.  \n\nLet's say you're a homeschool student living in rural Appalachia who carves and sells and plays flute and organizes music events for the community and you apply to college A and college B.  Then you have a middle class suburban public school kid who has done pretty traditional activities and is interested in STEM and also applies to college A and college B.  There might not be a lot of applicants that look a lot like student #1 applying and there might be a lot of students that look like #2.  So in reality student #1 might have a 25% shot at a school when student #2 might have a 5% shot at the same school with a school that has an overall acceptance rate of 10%.  With similar stats and let's say the acceptance rate is 10% overall.  \n\nYou are viewed in context and compared to peers.  You might want to consider some target schools where you might be a unique applicant in some way.  All you can do is look at the stats that exist and work from there.  If you are at a school that has naviance data, that can be helpful.  Though for some schools, I think that data may also be misleading.",

            "comment": "A couple ways to approach this. \n\nFirst, just use acceptance rate and deal with the inaccuracy. There are so many variables involved that to try to reduce difficulty of getting in to one metric is basically impossible. So acceptance rate is the best you can do. \n\nSecond, look at previous classes from your school. Compare yourself to those students and look at where they got in. This normalizes out as much as possible, but still could be inaccurate if you have strongly unique characteristics that aren\u2019t reflected in previous students (e.g. super strong hook like recruited athlete).",

            "comment": "I think the basic model you should have in your head is that the most competitive colleges will score unhooked applicants on all three of academics, activities (including non-recruited athletics), and personal/fit (aka \"subjective\"/\"soft\") factors, which they get evidence about from essays and letters of recommendation and possibly interviews and such.  Of course some universities, particularly public universities, may put more weight, even overwhelming weight, on the more objective factors.  But I think many people underrate the degree to which competitive private colleges and universities end up using \"subjective\"/\"soft\" factors to decide between candidates they all see as well qualified, even if objectively it might seem obvious the candidate who ends up rejected is at least a little better qualified than the candidate who ends up accepted.\n\nOK, so if you are looking at colleges where you seem competitive on academics given published admit stats, but admit rates for people with those academic qualifications are still very low, then there are two broad things to think about.\n\nOne is just that GPAs are not standardized, and so really understanding how your transcript will be scored relative to other transcripts is not as simple as looking at your GPA.  I think a decent number of people falter at this step--they think they are well-qualified academically based on their standardized tests scores and GPA, but then when the admissions people are done processing their grades in context, they end up being scored less competitively on academics than they were hoping.\n\nThe second is that once you actually are considered competitively academically, figuring out how the college will rank you on both the activities and personal factors, and what that implies about your odds, is not something you can easily do.  Particularly the personal factors, since they are so subjective.\n\nInterestingly, there does seem to be a lot of dependence.  This is why most experienced people say you really only need to apply to like two or three peer schools at most in a given competitiveness range.  Like, if School A admits you, the odds of peer School B also admitting you are very high, and vice-versa.  If both School A and School B admit you, the odds of peer School C also admitting you are extremely high, and vice-versa.  So among other things, this implies that if you apply to three peer schools and they all reject you, the odds that applying to a fourth would have made a difference is getting astronomically small.\n\n And yet, predicting which way those schools will break is not something anyone can really do reliably in advance.  I think experienced people will have their suspicions based on what they have seen before (meaning which sorts of applicants they have seen run the table one way or another), but they will rarely feel confident telling an academically well-qualified applicant they have no hope.\n\nBut this is why the concept of \"likely\" schools is important.  These are schools where you are sufficiently overqualified in \"objective\"/\"hard\" factors to minimize the chance the other stuff will then unqualify you.  And indeed, this is why generally the best \"likely\" schools are public universities, because if they weight objective factors highly then it makes it easier to gauge if your numbers alone will likely do it.\n\nAnd unfortunately, that is a more complicated answer than would be ideal, but I think it is about the best anyone can really do to predict outcomes, given the complexities of this system.",

    "postText": "\nI am an international student. My parents earn baically nothing. Combined they earn 2k a month. When i checked boston university it said average cost was 26k. But when i estimated via the calculator it gave me basically no aid. It told me to pay 75k a year. When i used the nyu calculator it told me i had to pay nothing. How does this work and do you know any universities like nyu who give a really big amount of aid?",

The NPC will not provide an accurate estimate for international applicants, and colleges are generally upfront about that. \n\nYou need to search for colleges that say they will meet full demonstrated need tor all accepted students. Many, like BU, do not provide aid to internationals.",

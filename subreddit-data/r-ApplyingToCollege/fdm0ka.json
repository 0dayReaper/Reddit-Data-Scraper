Legacy maximizes your chances IF you have the stats for the school, aka just as qualified. For average applicants w/ the requisite stats it's basically a lottery within a larger pool. I don't expect the admission rates to be higher than 30 - 35% for legacy, and 7-15% for non urm applicants, given that all of them are qualified students. Athletes are there for a diff purpose and student's parents donating buildings to get in... well how many parents are donating a couple million to the school each year? Probably not enough to be statistically significant.",

Marketing, HR, Real Estate development, logistics and supply, insurance, sales, etc.  Many athletes who play university level sports learn more than just their responsibilities on the field.  Granted, there are many who squander the opportunity, but there are just as many, if not more, who leverage their talents and dedication to the craft to get into a school they otherwise would not be able to.  How is this different than the artistic/musical prodigy?  Do you feel that admissions shouldnt be granted for them as well?    \n\nI've seen college athletes graduate to become successful bankers, architects, computer engineers, and doctors.  One thing they all shared in common - people who viewed their admission to the university or institution as something they weren't entitled to.  Institutions are learning environments, sure, but they are also places to dedicate the work ethic to learning a craft or trade or skill.  Your mindset demonstrates your \"entitlement\".",

It\u2019s different for D3 and some NIAA schools. For example, MIT football is D3. Their football players are technically recruited athletes and therefore get a small bump in admissions, but they still have to be able to get through admissions as if they\u2019re a normal applicant. While because Stanford is D1, as long as the player is eligible they\u2019re guaranteed to get in.",

I don\u2019t think he has a problem with sports being appreciated, but rather the special treatment given to sports over other activities. It\u2019s not like any kid working on a business comes to college to give a presentation or any coder comes to college to complete a pset. Why then should they offer tryouts to athletes?\n\nNow it\u2019s clear that sports programs bring in a ton of money for colleges but that money just gets pushed back into sports so there\u2019s no real benefit for the rest of the institution. Also college level sports is usually a gateway for professional careers but then why wouldn\u2019t they offer a special program for sports instead of putting athletes with the smart kids and giving them the same benefits?",

To be intelligent and at the top of your class does however. Universities are learning instructions. At their core, colleges are meant for young people with great intellectual potential, not for talented athletes.\n\nI love sports just as much as the next guy, but I hate to see hardworking intelligent kids denied from top schools, just for mediocre students who can throw a ball take their place.",

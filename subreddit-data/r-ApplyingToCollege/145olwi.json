    "postText": "Hello! Kind of in distress rn, my efc is 0, my aid from other schools was great, the school I choose is only giving me 7,000$ in aid with the cost of attending to be 27,000$. I didn't know it would be this low, I didn't get my fin aid from the school until after May 1st because of them having to verify my citizenship, what do I do? They didn't give me any pell grant money, and its really stressing me out because that's more then my family makes a year, do I go in person and talk with fin aid or what do I do?",

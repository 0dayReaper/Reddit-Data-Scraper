I've been lurking and occasionally commenting for over a year now and it's not that difficult to simply ignore the misinformation. As a rule of thumb, I never believe what other high school students have to say about admissions, and I only read the guides by users like admissionsmom, ScholarGrade, standfordchick, WilliamTheReader, etc. Insight into student and campus life is interesting to hear from current students (even college freshmen).\n\nIt seems to me that the problem with the so-called toxicity in this sub is due to how obsessed high school students can be. They are constantly on this sub, comparing stats, logging any and all thoughts they may have on the process. Couple that with anxiety and many people can spread and absorb the wrong information. Checking the sub once every few days, only posting specific questions you need answered, and just ignoring all the shitposts has been the best plan of action for me.",

College Confidential was good for format and has people with more info but is also filled with tons of helicopter parents and boomers so you've gotta sift through a lot. And their updated \"modern\" UI kinda killed what was left of the site.\n\nThere's actually a good deal of people who volunteer time so much that I bet you could make a good option between all the people hours involved, but organizing that is nearly impossible. People sometimes try to make a new website but the focus is always on making money or advising or something and not actually on the true value, which is organized and well researched/known/insider info. The reason A2C and CC work is because they are free.\n\nSo instead we are left with this odd fragmented scene of today. If I didn't have a day job I'd probably be about 25% of the way to making that magical third option, but I'm guessing by the time I retire I won't be as in tune with the college admissions world, which hopefully will have marginally improved by then.",

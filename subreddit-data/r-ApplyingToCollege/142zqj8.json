Everyone has been posting recently since it\u2019s the graduation season right now, and I\u2019ve noticed that EVERYONE is literally a valedictorian, except for some very few who are sal. When I finally find a graduation post that doesn\u2019t have a huge VALEDICTORIAN on their scarf, I see the comments shouting something like \u201cmy fav valedictorian.\u201d I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that my feed is nothing but valedictorian graduation speeches for the past few weeks. Yes, I\u2019ve also graduated as a top of my class, but this is still very, very intimidating. How is this even possible? Do these colleges select nothing but valedictorians?",

            "comment": "If I'm reading between the lines properly, are you worried you're going to be outdone by them for class grades and opportunities? I think that's a common concern to have (right up there with imposter syndrome), but in general, these T10 places have enough resources and opportunities for each student that trying to find things to do will likely be fairly painless\n\nTL;DR You'll be ok and any relative disadvantages you might have can be worked on. You have your head in the right place, turn it into productive endeavors!\n\nAs someone who graduated from a T20, I've learned that the valedictorian title means very different things from school to school. Some people went to really easy high schools where getting A's was very manageable even if you took 6 APs a year, while other people attended the TJ/Exeter/Lynbrook-type places that are basically harder than college. If you come from a place that falls in the latter category, then you have very little to worry about if you stay motivated. Even as someone who graduated in the 2nd (maybe even 3rd) decile of a Lynbrook-esque high school, I didn't struggle to outperform people with 4.8s from elsewhere unless they went to TJ, Harker, or Gunn\n\nEven if you attended a high school in the former category, your study habits aren't static and can be changed. A lot of my classmates attended easier high schools and did have to work harder to build successful study habits, but all of them eventually did (and some even did better in the same classes I took toward the back half of college). \n\nI actually think some people (disclaimer, not all of them) who graduated as HS valedictorians and decided to rest on their laurels (so to speak) ended up doing worse than people who've had their limits tested in an environment where they were far from being the smartest. The reason is that the former valedictorians were more prone to overconfidence in their academic abilities and have to mentally transition to no longer being the biggest fish in the pond. By recognizing the fact that you're playing a whole new ballgame, you're already a few steps ahead.",

(there's a saying at my school that if you miss more than 3 days a semester you'll never get a 4.0....and as someone who has *definitely* missed more than 3 days a semester, i can say that it's very true). i'm probably in the 25-50th percentile for gpa (3.3, school average is like a 3.65) and it kills me to be on this sub and be told that my chances at anything but a state school are nil because i have a &lt;3.9, even though i have very real extenuating circumstances (chronic illness + being LI) and i go to a school whose classes/grading system is so hard that i sometimes pop into nearby college classes (for subjects that i'm not even that great at!) and find them frustratingly easy lol\n\nit's comforting to hear this bc i always see upperclassmen go to t10s/20s/30s and coast (even while taking hard majors) and get crazy awards while partying all the time, even the ones that *didn't* get &gt;3.65s, but i guess it never really sunk in until right now. the amount of work i have to do right now sucks but i'll be grateful for it once i go to college. basically thanks for writing that out LOL i needed to hear it",

I see it as a choice between frontloading the difficult stuff and making college the easier part and leaving it to college like most people do\n\nIt'll probably be harder to stand out for top schools than attending an easier school on the basis of your classmates being more driven, and the difficulty might overwhelm you. But that environment serves its intended purpose (college prep) extremely well once you actually start college since you've probably had to dial in your study habits and work ethic much sooner than your classmates. So in the long term, you'll still end up doing great even if you don't look as impressive in the short term.",

That means around half the college, by a conservative estimate, graduated val or sal.\n\nSelection bias or not, that\u2019s a pretty staggering proportion. Does it matter? Not at all.

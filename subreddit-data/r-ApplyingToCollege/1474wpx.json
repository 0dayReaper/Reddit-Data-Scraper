    "postText": "Hi guys, so I got admitted to USC for Spring 2024 as a business admin major, but I want to change my major to CSBA since I want to gain both business and computer science skills. I just emailed the admission advisor, so I\u2019m waiting on the results but I\u2019m assuming I would have to take additional courses for that major change. Is there anyone that changed their major from business admin to csba? Could you share your experience with csba?",

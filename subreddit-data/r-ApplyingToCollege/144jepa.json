    "postText": "I applied to two schools and two schools only. One was a public in state safety school, but not with the specialized degree I want to pursue. The other being what I would consider a dream school\u2014OOS Public. The dream school has the degree, but with an exorbitantly higher price tag attached to it. I applied on a whim and was surprised that I was accepted (we\u2019re talking screaming, running down the hallways, etc.)\n\nThen, the financial aid letter came. 56k/year. I cannot afford that. My parents cannot afford that. We have different ideas of how debt can impact quality of life, and when it came to making a choice on the school I was heavily swayed by their comments \u201cOh, everyone has debt. It\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d \u201cJust go and get the degree. You only live once, right?\u201d I committed without a second thought.\n\nWhen it comes to student loan debt, I am very, very wary of it\u2014to the point where I have been getting anxiety attacks these past months just thinking about the hundreds of thousands of dollars I will pour into an arts degree with little to no job security\u2014one of the worst rates in all fields.\n\nIn hindsight I was thinking about the popularity of the school, the low acceptance rate, and all the glimmer it held in my eyes\u2014not asking myself if this school is actually right for me.\n\nWhat concerns me is that the choices I made in fear of not being \u201cgood enough\u201d to apply to more schools (ones that I actually picture myself at/not influenced by my family\u2019s own opinions) have left me between a rock and a hard place. Like I will come to resent my time at the dream school just because I never exhausted all the options I wanted to for others validation.\n\nThere is a choice to defer my enrollment for a year at said dream school, but part of me also wonders all these feelings I\u2019ve felt since committing will lessen once I get there. (very doubtful of this happening)\n\nI have the opportunity to go live with my brother in a larger city with my brother next year, rent free and help him with his online business. I really want to apply to more schools during this time, actually research and plan ahead to the best of my ability so that the school I decide on will a choice I won\u2019t regret. I'm tired of living for others while also selling myself short. Any advice about gap years? Should I just stick it out at the dream school? Any and all perspectives are welcome\n\nEdit: In the interest of transparency as well, the degree is a BFA in Acting.",

Of course, there were other reasons that made me not want to start college yet (academic burnout and other things), that debt anxiety was the nail in the coffin for me and I ultimately took a gap year. It was a last minute decision but I'm really glad I did. \n\nI think if you're really feeling like going to this dream school won't be worth it (or at least not worth it right now), you should take a gap year. Whether that year consist of deferring from the school or straight up withdrawing and trying for other schools, you should do it if it's a better option. I'd suggest reflecting some more and maybe make a pros and cons list of going to this school or taking a year off, just make sure that whatever choice you make is *yours* and not your families and that your decision is for the right reasons, and make a plan for productive things to do during a gap year if you choose to take it.",

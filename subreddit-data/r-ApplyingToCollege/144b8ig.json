    "postText": "so im a rising junior and planning to ideally go for a double major in chemistry and physics but the DE chemistry and AP physics 1 courses (the only \"advanced\" chem/physics courses offered at my school for juniors) were both already full when I consulted my counselor.\r  \n\r  \ni was thinking about self-studying for AP Chemistry and physics 1 and C (i was going to do it anyways) but i'm not sure if colleges will overlook the lack of relevant courses in my schedule based on my AP scores.\r  \n\r  \n\\[I'll also found a chemistry and a physics club next year if that helps at all / and im doing IchO next year and USAPHO senior\\]",

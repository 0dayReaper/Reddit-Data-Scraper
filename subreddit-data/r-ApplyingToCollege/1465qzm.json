My second option was the University of Illinois for EE\n\nI actually didn't enjoy my time at WashU too much until my third year since 1st and 2nd years got gutted by Covid. At the time, I wanted to go to a place that was nothing like my Bay Area HS, so I was partial to smaller schools that had lots of resources for each student. I was also bouncing around between majoring in Chem, EE, CS, BME, Bio, and Physics, so I wanted the flexibility to change my mind. Educational quality being equalized (to the same crappy standard) by remote learning took most of that away and made lots of people very unhappy lmao\n\nMy third (and unfortunately final) year was in-person, and I was a lot happier because I could take full advantage of being at a place like WashU. The value of the school multiplied when I decided to pursue an MD-PhD. To keep things short, WashU played a major role in why I had a successful application cycle and is also why I have the privilege of being able to stay at WashU for MD-PhD training\n\nI'm ultimately really glad I attended, but I got lucky that my career interests put me in a situation where WashU's ability to get me on the right track was second to none. Even if I stuck with EE though, the resources the department could invest in each student would have set me up for anything I wanted to do post-graduation. However, it's less clear whether WashU would have been the right move over Illinois in that situation.",

While it\u2019s hard to quantify name recognition or prestige, I would wager that Purdue\u2019s engineering program is just as nationally/internationally recognized as Columbia\u2019s, if not more. Columbia is a private school in the ivy league, and will have many great opportunities for internships and connections. But Purdue has one of the largest alumni networks and career fairs in the country, so I wouldn\u2019t really be missing out.\n\nIf I went to either school, I would have received an (equally) excellent education with great opportunities. The question is, do I want 100k in my pocket when I graduate at a T10 school, or be down an extra 100k in student loans to go to a T20. Plus, the cost of living in Indiana is a lot lower than the cost of living in New York, so it would probably be more than 100k difference.",

I\u2019m attending Yale for Neuroscience in the fall, but if I didn\u2019t, I would be attending Howard as a Karsh STEM Scholar and Biology major because not only would I go there completely free, but they will fund anything I choose do in STEM in or out of school including trips. It would have also been easier for me to play tennis like I want to since their D3. Or, I would go to Emory on partial scholarship as a neuroscience major because Emory has better resources and programs than Howard for STEM especially for neuroscience, and Emory is D3 too. Plus, Emory is way better in terms of diversity for me than Yale or Howard. The only down side is I already live in metro-Atlanta, so I would be staying home, and I always planned on going out of state for college. Overall, I picked Yale because they revised their financial aid offer to something extremely cheap last minute, their neuroscience program is better (Howard doesn\u2019t have a neuroscience major and few neuroscience resources), they are good feeder school for the MD-PhD program of my dreams at Harvard med, and they have a good club tennis team and the collegiate coach said I could potentially play on the collegiate team in a later year. None of the coaches at other schools responded when I tried to reach out before I picked my school. New Haven is probably the worst city of the 3, but I think (and hope) the other perks make up for it.",

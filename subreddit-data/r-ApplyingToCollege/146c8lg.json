I\u2019ll check them out.\n\nRutgers is one I\u2019m considering- but at the same time\u2026 like\u2026 ew New Jersey.\n\nPenn state is possible, simultaneously though it kinda just sounds bland. This is completely out of the blue, uneducated mumbo jumbo but I think Pennsylvania is the blandest state in the states",

And you get to wear a Fightin\u2019 Blue Hen on your shirt. \n\nWe liked Rutgers better than we expected.  Good nearby dining and arts district, great D1 sports conference, easy train ride to NYC, and underrated academics. \n\nSome people do dislike Penn State.  I honestly love it and took all of my kids to visit.  PSU is very much it\u2019s own town: 40,000 undergrads, 275+ majors, thousands of classes, and 1000+ clubs and activities.  One of the main streets adjacent to campus is lined with coffee shops, cafes, stores, book shops, and fast casual and fine dining.  Sports are obviously an exciting aspect of campus life.  And we liked the rural vibe and outdoor recreational opportunities.  But, yeah, it\u2019s not for those who crave an NYU experience.  Or fear high OOS tuition.",

It\u2019s just a completely unfounded bias I have towards Pennsylvania. From my perspective Pennsylvania is always the line where the roads get bad",

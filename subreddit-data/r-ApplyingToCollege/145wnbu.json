            "comment": "Probability that you will want to, or that they will let you?\n\nI am fairly sure the first four colleges you mentioned do not have any capped/restricted access majors, which means you are just admitted generally to the college, have time to decide on which major to pursue, and can often switch even after making your original decision as long as you can meet the course requirements for the new major.\n\nSo, it doesn't matter if you tell them during the application process you are intending to be a Physics major.  You could immediately start taking Econ classes and then become an Econ major and they wouldn't have a problem with that.\n\nIn contrast, I don't know all the details but I believe the UC system does in fact have capped/restricted access majors.  They also identify what they call impacted majors, which is majors for which there is more demand than resources, and it appears Economics is an impacted major at both Berkeley and UCLA.  And so in those cases you would specifically need to check how they were handling Economics declarations.\n\nOff hand, a quick googling suggests Economics at Berkeley has a minimum GPA requirement but no numerical cap, so you would obviously have to meet that GPA requirement but that might be it. \n\nAgain, off hand it looks to me like at UCLA if you are admitted as a freshman you might just need to meet a minimum GPA requirement to get access to their Econ majors, but in contrast transfer students need to actually be admitted as Econ majors and can't switch in after transferring.\n\nBut you should confirm all that if it is actually going to be relevant to you.",

            "comment": "I know WashU makes it very easy to switch schools and majors (only mentioning bc I 100% know this). Beyond that, I think most of your schools will be lax with major switching except for UCLA/Cal. The UCs have a shit ton of impacted majors and with their class sizes switching majors can get somewhat hectic and challenging. As an SF resident I had to sit through numerous lectures on applying to and attending UCs by my school\u2019s college guidance office (packed with former AOs). They all said that changing popular majors at highly competitive UCs can get tricky, and I know Cal is very well regarded for both physics and economics!",

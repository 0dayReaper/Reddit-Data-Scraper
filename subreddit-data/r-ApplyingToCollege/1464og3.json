You are not planning on relocating to Michigan, and Michigan wouldn't give you in state if you tried.\n\nBTW, my state does a reciprocal transfer of taxes with Michigan...meaning they collect and transfer taxes to my home state so I don't file in  Michigan at all.  Perhaps you should check.",

You will either find that your states have reciprocity or you will need to pay taxes to WI and claim a credit for taxes paid to MI.\n\nEDIT: They have reciprocity - [https://www.revenue.wi.gov/Pages/FAQS/pcs-work.aspx](https://www.revenue.wi.gov/Pages/FAQS/pcs-work.aspx)",

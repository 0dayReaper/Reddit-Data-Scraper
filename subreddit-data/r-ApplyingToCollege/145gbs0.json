    "postText": "I know this will be different at every school but what y'all think according to experiences etc.\n\nI take regular Pre Calc rn and the grade require to take AP Calc senior year is 97 or higher. I had a 96 but my math teacher signed the waiver form to let me take AP calc and my counselor added it to my schedule (this was 3 months ago)\n\nHowever, now my grade is like a 92 or 93 which isn't bad but it's clearly dropped in the last quarter and the final. in your school would this mean there's a chance they don't let u take the class even if you've signed up for it next year? my teacher did sign it and my counselor did add it but I don't want my name to be removed.\n\nplease lmk",

    "postText": "Please don\u2019t cram your entire summer into being ECs to boost college. I 10000% don\u2019t mean do none but only do ones you might enjoy, get a good experience out of, and will give you room to relax and just enjoy the summer. A thing I worry about is people desperate for ECs wasting all their time on empty ones only done to add a check mark on their application, and especially in their last summer as a \u201ckid.\u201d College isn\u2019t all of life, this subreddit may make it seem like it is but I promise you\u2019ll appreciate having an enjoyable summer. Again I do recommend ECs as long as they are genuine experiences you\u2019ll enjoy and will let you also enjoy summer away from them. If you have any other perspectives please tell me, I would heavily appreciate them especially from people who\u2019ve gone through the application funhouse.",

            "comment": "I agree, personally I never did much of anything over the summer outside of some light volunteering, I thought I worked enough during the school year so I just wanted to relax when I could. I got into my T25 top choice, my brother had the same philosophy as me and he's currently attending an Ivy. Of course what worked for us may not work for everyone, and if there is some kind of summer program or internship or whatever you're legitimately interested in you should do it, but I think it's totally fine to actually enjoy your summer while you still can as a high schooler.",

This could be the difference between getting loans or getting a full ride as well, even if I didn't care about prestige and job outcomes and location etc. Or if I'm ever coming to US or not.  \nI don't care about \"wasting time as a child\", I have plenty of summers ahead. Also I could take a gap year if I wanted to, and a gap year will feel be a lot better if you're not forced to do it and go through another application process all over again.  \nNot like doing many ECs make for a miserable summer, challenging maybe but productive",

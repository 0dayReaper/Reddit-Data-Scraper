    "postText": "I did some research online, but I wanted to ask here as well. Would you guys recommend liberal arts colleges over regular universities for liberal arts majors like History? I want to apply to T20s but I was wondering if I should also expand my list to some liberal arts colleges too, like Amherst, Swathamore, and Williams?",

            "comment": "Academically they can be great for history and most other subjects.  Whether you could choose them over a research university depends on if you prefer their environment.  If you are interested in that smaller environment with more opportunities for faculty interaction I would definitely consider them.\n\nAlong with those very top ranked LACs, ones like Vassar and Wesleyan produce a lot of grads that end up getting a PhD in History.  You also have some universities like William and Mary that share a lot of the traits that LACs do and would be very good options.",

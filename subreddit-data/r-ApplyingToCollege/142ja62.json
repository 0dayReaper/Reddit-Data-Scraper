As for r/sat, that was helpful because people would post some of the more complex sat questions and being able to explain the question/right answer was helpful in making sure I really understood all of the content",

If time is an issue, and it generally is, go with panda then subscribe to 1600io and print out official tests online. It\u2019ll go through all the questions and you can FFwd to only ones you got incorrect. Was imo a good way to boost toward &gt;1500 score. also btw did metzer grammar and was comparable to panda but panda was straight to the point",

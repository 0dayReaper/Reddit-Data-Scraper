Also, US News ranking will now emphasize on diversity and remove alumni giving according to CNN. Just curious what prestige whores gonna do with the new ranking.",

They still need to sell their magazines every year, so they'll continue to create these rankings, and there shouldn't be too many changes either... Moreover, I don't think a lot of undergrad colleges will drop out of the rankings - that applies more to law schools.",

We learn our subjects thoroughly, but we are expected to just be able to magically transmit that to students. Many of us aren\u2019t good at that. Which is no big deal in the upper divs, where it\u2019s more of a mentorship relationship with students who have the fundamentals, and now are ready and eager to plunge into the good stuff with the people who really know their stuff. You can learn a ton from a mumbling brilliant disorganized professor and his awkward TA. \n\nIt\u2019s a very different situation in gen eds and pre major requirements. News flash: teaching is hard, y\u2019all. Effective pedagogy requires skills. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s a whole-ass profession. Also the faculty would far rather teach the fun stuff with the engaged students, not get stuck with the dreaded 101 course containing bad attitudes and absentees and whiners and beggars for an extra half point of partial credit on every quiz. \n\nTalk to anyone who has done some or all their pre-majors at a community college where the faculty may or may not have PhDs, but are committed to teaching. They\u2019ll usually confirm that the quality of instruction is higher. What you need the 4 year university for is the upper division majors courses.",

They have a better idea of what is likely to be easy and what is likely to be hard for students\n\n2.

The pressure of doing well in undergrad is still in recent memory\n\n3a.

And, the reality is that for most of these very large classes the class size doesn\u2019t really matter because they almost all come with separate discussion and lab sections of like 25 people, so you\u2019re still getting whatever \u201cone-on-one\u201d time you might need.\n\nAll pre-req courses are more than 50 people, lol, even at HYPSM. They're all usually \"hundreds of students.\" Average figure is still pretty meaningful imo. Into sophomore year at most top schools you can start taking upper-levels with &lt;15 kids in each class on top of a great professor + TA. This is just infinitesimally better  for a variety of quality of life factors, not to mention more tangible ones like getting significantly stronger and more personal LoRs (and getting them more easily), getting TA positions in most courses you want, direct and facile contact with professors, and generally professors who actually care about teaching these courses. This adds up over 2-3 years relative to if you didn't have it.\n\nIt's not a make-or-break factor, but it's probably the legit most objective and noticeable difference among colleges. What the hell else are you doing to be looking at lmao. Research output for undergrads? Major specific rankings (aka grad school rankings that don't pertain to undergrad)? Other worthless USNews metrics? \n\nYour point in general is just a softer version of effectively saying \"I can always find help for any particular problem in a class so what is the point of x y z in a class.\"",

            "comment": "Welcome to the world. Many colleges have opted out of the U.S. News ranking system over the years. It 's not a new thing even if you've just heard about it. And, even if these schools no longer provide statistics, U.S. News continues to rank these schools by using their own statistics. Most are available on the colleges' own websites. \n\nBut, in addition to whaever US News does (and who really cares?), if I were you, I'd work on improving my writing, especially if I planned to go to a decent college or university. \n\nIt's \"learned,\" not \"leaned\". Check what you write before you post it. Nothing makes a paper look lousier than typos and bad grammar, both of which your writing suffers from.  \n\nWhat in the world does \"numbers can't really reflect undergrad experience\" mean? All US News does is use numbers. Are you sure you have this right? I'm not sure you do. Is US News just going to \"feel\" how good a college is? \"Why, I think this college feels really smart!\" It sounds like BS to me. \n\n\"Emphasize on diversity\" is both ungrammatical and unclear. How about \"US News claims it will now put more emphasis on diversity\"? Submit an essay on a college application that's this bad, and good luck. \n\nBeyond your writing problems is the question of how will US News do what it claims it will do? What kind of diversity are they even talking about? Percentage of gays on campus? How in the world are they going to determine that? They won't. They don't care. Percentage of foreign students? Why does that matter? Percentage of athletes on campus? Percentage of Austronesians? I'm pretty sure \"diversity\" is just their buzz word for \"How many African-Americans do you now enroll?\" Nothing wrong with that, but could they at least be honest? \n\nAlso, isn't it going tobe hard to even know all of this if a school won't release those figures?\n\nAlso why do anyone even care? if the percentage of Asians on campus is 35% instead of \"only\" 25% does that upset you? Beyond about 10%, maybe 15%, why does it matter? If only 14% of students are Muslims do you care? They're badly treated, too, aren't they? These statistics seem seriously dumb to me. I don't particularly want to go to a school where nearly everyone is white, of course, but racial and other percentages, beyond a certain point, hardly matter. Why is 35% better than 25%? Will they do \"percentage of Jews on campus\"? That wouild be interesting, wouldn't it? Percentage of Born Again Christians\"? Other stats? I seriously doubt it. \"Diversity\" has only one meaning. \n\nYou write \"alumni giving according to CNN\"?  In clear English: \"According to CNN, US News will remove alumni giving as a factor in their rankings.\"\n\nIs that a good thing? Maybe schools with tons of money are better places to go? Do you want to go to some impoverished school? Do you want to go to a school so poor it's about to go out of business? I don't. Colleges fail all the time, especially lately. And doesn't a \"low giving percentage\" say something about a school? Doesn't it suggest lack of satisfaction? I'd say it does. A school where 50% of alums contribute regularly seems a lot better to me than a school which only gets 10% of its alums to contribue. \n\nBeyond those things, asking about \"prestige whores\" has no meaning because it's irrelevant. What you might do is question the rankings. You don't do that. You may think this is harsh, but college admissions is harsh. Try applying to seriously good colleges and universities by writing this poorly, by being this unaware, and by only asking  \"what prestige whores will do\". It may not go very well.",

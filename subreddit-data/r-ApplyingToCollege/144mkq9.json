    "postText": "Even though I am completely done with the college application process, I still like reading this subreddit (for whatever reason it's kind of fun lol), and I've been seeing a lot of people here stressing about being \"boring\" or \"average\" and not having an extravagant story to tell. And I completely get that, because I was in that exact same position last year. As an Asian-American from a middle class background, I was worried that my stories would be over-represented and uninteresting.\n\nSo, here's some stuff that I picked up along my essay writing process that helped me out. Also note that this is mostly anecdotal, so take it or leave it if you don't think it's helpful :)\n\n\\#1: Clearly define your strengths/traits\n\nThis will not only make your essay stronger, but also more consistent with the rest of your app. I was able to get a better idea of this by asking my teachers, friends, and parents five words they would use to describe me. Once I wrote that down, I tried to find patterns/themes; that gave me a base of things to communicate in my essays. Focus less on what your topic is, and more on how that topic showcases your personality.\n\n\\#2: If your topic is \"overused\" or \"typical.\" work to make it uniquely yours\n\nI decided to write my Common App essay about my experience playing a video game (s/o to any FM players out there!), a topic that's definitely not that unique. However, I think my essay worked because I emphasized how: A) Through my experience, I became more determined and creative in finding solutions beyond the game, B) My approach to the game said something about me as a person, and C) How the game enabled me to be more confident and willing to try new things.\n\n\\#3: Don't over-complicate the process\n\nYes, this is a really important essay. Yes, you need to put a lot of time and thought into it. But don't agonize over it if you think it's negatively affecting your mental health. Don't feel like you're lesser because of your essay or your experiences, and don't overthink or spend forever writing. My essay that I submitted was written after maybe two weeks of drafting and revision. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good!\n\nTLDR: know your strengths, make those strengths known in your essay, and don't get down on yourself for not having a perfect topic or essay.\n\nWishing you juniors the best of luck, you guys got this!!",

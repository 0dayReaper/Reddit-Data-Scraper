    "postText": "I'm applying to universities like Texas A&amp;M, Rice, UT Austin as a Comp Sci major. Due to the death of one of my family members, my 2nd semester of HS as a senior was shit. I failed one semester of AP Calc and Stats. If I do exceedingly well at university in my first semester before applying as a transfer, will this count against me? Please be honest. Answers from admission officers or counselors are requested and appreciated.",

    "postText": "Wanted to hop on here and ask if it's worth it to attend an institution within the University of Texas school system (not UT Austin) with a full tuition scholarship or to attend a T20 school and pay for it ($60k+/yr) for the prestige, research, and connections. No family financial issues (can afford ivy w o loans) but the full ride would help.\n\nEdit: I have a 36 and 1600 + will qualify for National Merit but i\u2019m not sure abt specific merit based scholarships at T20s or within the UT school system.\n\nMajor: pre-medical so biochem or neuroscience\n\nCareer aspirations: physician, surgeon, medical field-type",

The prestige from an undergraduate degree isn't going to earn you *that* much more money per year. I'm an employer, I know. You think I want to pay people way more when all they've done is go to a fancier school? It helps you get your foot in the door, but you don't get a ton of special treatment salary wise. \n\nThe connections? Most of them are already formed before you get there. You're walking into an environment full of elite rich people. You might make a great connection that helps you rise up a little faster somewhere someday, but you can do that anywhere. I've gotten far more vital connections in my life from just working and meeting people.\n\nResearch? Tons of colleges do research. Do you want to be a researcher all your life? If so maybe the Ivy thing makes more sense if you plan on just staying there forever, pursuing academia through a PhD, and going on to work on some amazing project. I *might* see the value in that approach. But that's only if you want to make research your life. \n\nIf your family has $240k laying around and doesn't need loans it'd honestly be much better to just invest that money in something else and watch it grow. Even a conservative investing strategy means $300k when you graduate and that's far more useful than an Ivy undergraduate degree. Save that money and go do a master's at an Ivy school. THAT makes sense.",

They want you to salivate for them because that's how they can justify taking your money.\n\nAnd I'm sure they're great places, I've heard great things. But not $240k great.\n\nAnd that's where the experience comes into play. You'll find in life that getting a degree is important, but the truth is that YOU ultimately determine your success, not your college.\n\nI got a job that required no experience to hone skills. Those skills landed me a better job. That job introduced me to someone who did have a degree and she brought me over later to an even better job. They told me to get a degree to keep the job, so I did. Got the cheapest accredited option possible. \n\nAnd while at this better job, I met some very interesting people. I started to move up in society. Some of those people are now my business partners.\n\nNone of this was a direct consequence of college. It was strictly my interpersonal skills, building good relationships, and working hard to do my work as well as possible. \n\nSo if you have those traits and that attitude, I can guarantee you'll succeed out of UT whatever.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an Asian female attending a highly competitive large public school. I went to a private catholic school my freshman year and it was also online (Covid), so it inflated my bad GPA.\n\nMy freshman year GPA was UW 4.0, now I\u2019m a junior with a cumulative UW GPA of 3.4. My low GPA is largely due to skipping levels of math I shouldn\u2019t have lol.\n\nI have taken 8 APs and am planning to take 4 more my senior year. 4s and 5s on all so far.\n\nECs:\n1. Cofounder of relatively big business nonprofit\n2. Sell my art and donate proceeds\n3. Employed swim coach/lifeguard\n4. Self-employed private swim instructor\n5. Self-employed tutor/babysitter\n6. Varsity cross country- 4 years, team captain, treasurer, 2x state qualifier\n7. Varsity track- 4 years, team captain\n8. Wind Ensemble- first chair in section\n\nI won\u2019t go into awards for the sake of privacy but they are nothing impressive imo.\n\nI\u2019m really confident about my letter of recs and I believe I will write decent essays. \n\nViewing my application holistically, will my GPA really impact my admissions? Considering my heavy course load and time consuming ECs, will readers be understanding of my low GPA at all?",

            "comment": "&gt;Viewing my application holistically, will my GPA really impact my admissions?\n\nYes. Holistic admissions doesn't mean GPA is ignored. It's still one of the most important parts, if not **the** most important part of the application. How much it impacts depends upon how selective the university is \n\n&gt;Considering my heavy course load and time consuming ECs, will readers be understanding of my low GPA at all\n\nSame answer as above",

Doesn't mean you should give up hope though. If you rock senior year, still good chances. Also, if you have a very good SAT score, then that can help a little bit.",

They're not going to cut you slack for having time consuming ECs if they think you're not a top student, but they probably won't just you as someone who start coasting after freshman year if the counselor letter explains things well.\n\nIf you made it to states twice in cross-country in a competitive state (not sure if that's sophomore/junior, or junior, and you assume you'll make it again as a senior), you might get recruited as an athlete, though.

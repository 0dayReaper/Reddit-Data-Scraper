They're super competitive for everybody. Secondly, this would make more sense if you had an SAT score. I'll tell you rn as somebody who scored 1580s on practice tests, they aren't actually great predictors of your real scores (I ended up with a 1550, but had to take 3 times). Secondly, US colleges do recognize ATAR, but they will likely still see your full transcript, no? This would look rather concerning to them, as they like to weigh the entirety of high school rather than just senior year. I also see some not insane ECs on here. does piano grade mean ABRSM grade 5?\n\nFinally, are there any crazy factors on here that you haven't told us about? I'd say, from what you've posted (no offense), you have a very low chance at every single one of these. It would be pretty lucky to even get 1 on here, and getting lots of FA from it would be even more rare.\n\nOfc, nobody on here can actually predict where you will get into. Perhaps you will come back in December and show us your ED acceptance to Harvard, or your EA acceptance to UChicago. Maybe you're the best essay writer we've ever seen. Best of luck!",

So, internationally they don't rank that well but they are still powerhouses and very respected. This is true for Germany as well. Some schools only do aerospace engineering, or cs, etc.\n\nI wouldn't rule them out.",

International students don\u2019t get aid at most institutions, much less prestigious or large ones, or large amounts of aid. Additionally, you\u2019re only interested in schools that are in the international T100, and your grades aren\u2019t sufficient for most of the US ones",

(Source: I lived there for a long time and I'm also applying to colleges now like you)\n\nI doubt your GPA would be estimated based on your ATAR, especially since you don't receive an ATAR until after you finish Year 12 and by then (even if you apply for next fall) the applications would definitely be due. So they would most likely calculate your GPA from your letter grades. This may not work in your advantage but GPA isn't the only factor they consider. But then again, I'm not exactly sure. You may want to email an admissions counsellor.\n\nYou have pretty good extracurriculars in my opinion but you should try and take the SAT or ACT at least once depending on your strengths. I would recommend you do some research on which one would be better for you. \n\nIn terms of your college list, every single one is a reach even without financial aid. So keep some backup colleges in mind (safety schools that will most likely accept you and you would be happy going to). And you are requesting financial aid which not every school will grant (CMU gives no aid to international students). \n\nFortunately, for a select few schools, your ability to pay doesn't influence your chances of getting in even if you are international (which you are).\nFrom the schools that you are applying to, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth, and Amherst will not hold it against you if you need financial aid and will most likely give it to you if you get in. MIT and Bowdoin are thy other two. But then again, these are all top schools. \n\nIn terms of your chances, it's impossible to predict. Every school here is a reach. But what I have been told very frequently is that essays play a large role in the process, so make sure that those are good.\n\nGood luck in everything. Sorry that it's very long. And one more quick note, I'm not just muttering random information. I actually researched some of this myself (especially the international need blind admissions stuff)",

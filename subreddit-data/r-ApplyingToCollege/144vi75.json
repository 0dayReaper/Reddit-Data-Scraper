    "postText": "Ik i'll get a good one from my APES teacher (APES does count for stem right...?)\n\nAPCSA teacher told us that she literally has a boilet plate template which she barely changes, and even though that's the major I want to do, she dosen't have the most positive impression of me. Probably got one of the highest grades my ap calc teacher saw in his life time. But... that's about it. No other substance to the letter.\n\n**Really leaning towards lang rn. Even though I didn't participate as much as I should've, the teacher is known for writing good letters and i feel like she'll know a bit more about me from my essays, which I 've always excelled on. I'll also have her for Lit next year. So if i do pick her, should i get the letter now, or try to make more of an effort for the first month of school next year and ask her then? I just don't want her to forget this years stuff...** ",

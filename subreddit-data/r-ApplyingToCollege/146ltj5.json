            "comment": "You\u2019re asking a far more nuanced question than you may realize.\n\nThere are roughly 2,600 four-year college in the US. Broadly speaking, they each fall into one of four buckets of schools relative to financial aid for international students:\n\n* A handful of schools are need-blind and provide full aid; they will make their admissions decision without regard to finances and, if you get in, they will fully cover your demonstrated financial need. There are only seven schools in this group currently: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Dartmouth, Amherst, and Bowdoin. A few more are slated to join in the next year or two. Admissions at these schools is obviously ultra highly-competitive, and they reject the vast, vast majority of ALL applicants (both domestic and international) based on academics.\n* Some schools (~50?) are need-aware and provide full aid; these schools will not admit an international student if they cannot or will not meet the students financial need. While these schools are often characterized as being \u201cgenerous\u201d it\u2019s important to understand that these schools quite literally reject the vast majority of aid-seeking international applicants based on their need for aid. You will need to be a very, very strong applicant to overcome this reality.\n* Other schools (~50?) are need-aware and provide limited aid; similar to above, your need for financial aid will be considered as part of the school\u2019s decision to admit or reject your application. Unlike above, these schools offer limited financial aid to those students they do admit. These schools are typically somewhat less selective than those above, but still require an applicant to be a highly competitive applicant.\n* Then there are many, many schools \u2014 especially the vast majority of state schools \u2014 which pay no attention to how much money you need at all.  This means that they will happily admit students (international and domestic) who cannot possibly afford to attend and then offer them zero financial aid. These schools tend to have higher acceptance rates than the other two, but that doesn\u2019t really matter to an aid-seeking international student, does it?\n\nUnfortunately, statistically speaking, it is extraordinarily unlikely that an international student seeking full/significant aid will be both admitted to a US school AND have 100% of their financial need met.",

Really good value compared to its peers, but may still be kind of pricey.\n\nIf you get national merit or one of the college board recognition programs Texas A&amp;M has a pretty good scholarship that waives the out of state costs at least.  UT Dallas and Texas Tech have some easier scholarships that waive the out of state costs.\n\nI would definitely look at Harvey Mudd as another reach option if you like Olin. I would actually add more private reach schools that could give you need based aid (check their net price calculators).\n\nUCLA and Berkeley don't give OOS need based aid, and are likely too expensive given the info you have provided.",

I just can't justify the financial burden.",

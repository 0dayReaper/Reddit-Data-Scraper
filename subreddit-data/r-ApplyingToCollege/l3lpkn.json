If you say with admiration \u201cMan, that\u2019s a pretty good cake,\u201d it means the same as it would in British, an excellent cake. If you say with little emotion \u201cit\u2019s pretty good,\u201d it becomes an overstatement that means it\u2019s decent. It\u2019s not sarcasm - it\u2019s just a diplomatic way of saying something is decent. (It would be offensive to tell someone the food they cooked is \u201cdecent,\u201d but it\u2019s fine to say it\u2019s \u201cpretty good\u201d even when your intended meaning is clear.)\n\nWhen \u201cpretty\u201d is modifying words other than \u201cgood\u201d there\u2019s often less distinction and it tends to be used as it is in British (like pretty beautiful/tasteful/delicious). There are just a few other words that work like \u201cpretty good\u201d with the possibility of overstatement (the first one to come to mind is \u201cpretty happy,\u201d which can be sincere or mean \u201cdecently content\u201d depending on tone).",

One of their writers got the idea to create a somewhat arbitrary ranking of US colleges.  Within five years it was their most popular segment and it exploded (and saved the magazine - seriously, without it, US News and World Report would be long gone).  Readers loved the idea that some colleges were marginally better than others and students, parents, and alumni alike eagerly awaited the next update so they could flex on their peers.  \n\nBut it got worse from there.  People started consulting the rankings when deciding where to apply to college.  By 1997 41% of students said the rankings were an important factor in their college choice.  This caused colleges to suddenly care about where they landed on this glorified Buzzfeed slideshow.  Many of them started emphasizing the criteria the rankings used and neglecting things that weren't included in the formulas.  Some colleges outright gamed the new system or even cheated and lied to juice their ratings.  Seriously, they were brash and bloodthirsty about it:\n\n- USF reported an average SAT score 40 points higher than their real number because the admissions staff decided not to include their bottom 6% of scorers as part of a \"marketing strategy.\"\n\n- Northeastern excluded all of their international and remedial students (20% of the student body) in the numbers they reported.\n\n- Monmouth straight up fabricated an average SAT score that was **200 points** higher than reality.  They blamed it on a rogue \"former employee.\"\n\n- RPI boosted their stats by counting as rejects any admitted student who was initially waitlisted *or who did not get admitted to all of their indicated major choices.*  Seriously.  They decided to just reject someone from one of their chosen majors, then count that student in the denominator, but not numerator, of their acceptance rate.\n\n- Boston University reported SAT math scores for international students (which were generally high) while curiously NOT reporting their verbal scores (which were generally much lower).\n\n- NYU stopped including \"economically disadvantaged students\" from their reported metrics.\n\n- Even Harvard overstated their SAT scores by 15 points, calling it a \"mystery\" when it was later discovered.\n\nThe list is virtually endless - Oklahoma admitted to lying about their alumni giving statistics for 20 years; a former university president admitted to the so-called \"common practice\" of massaging the peer evaluation form which US News supplies, assigning artificially low ratings to colleges which were immediately ahead of themselves in the rankings; Claremont McKenna was even temporarily banned from the rankings list for their egregious cheating.  There are literally dozens and dozens of examples of ethics and morality sacrificed at the altar of the rankings god.  Colleges recruiting students they fully intend to reject is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nYou can read the whole saga here, ironically in a 2001 UChicago magazine article:  https://magazine.uchicago.edu/0110/features/abuse.html\n\nIf no one cared about the rankings, then colleges wouldn't feel the need to massage the numbers, recruit rejects, or lie and cheat.  But as long as y'all and your parents are over there simping on the T20 list, they're going to play the game.\n\nSo if you don't like it, toss the rankings.  Find a college that you think is a good fit for you and offers a valuable education (e.g. www.ctcl.org, etc).  And most of all, don't apply somewhere just because they sent you marketing materials.",

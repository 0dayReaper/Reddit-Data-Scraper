    "postText": "Good morning, I graduated in 2017 with a Computer Science Bachelors Degree and lately I have been having excitement thinking about going to school for a Physical Therapy DPT program. I need to get pre-requisites done before I even apply to the program and when I was scoping out the classes I need to take at a community college, I was getting very stressed &amp; overwhelmed. Here I was thinking that I can just go in as a non-degree student(full time night classes), take the classes that I need to take for what I need and be done with it(such as Chemistry I/II, Anatomy &amp; Physiology I/II, Statistics, etc..) but when I looked closer to the courses, they were saying that I would possibly need to take other pre-requisite classes to even get into that class. This was stressing me out even more making me think that I was going to have to spend more time and money to get the ball rolling. \n\nEven though I saw they had a note saying that there are exceptions that could be made to get into the classes instead of taking pre-req's to get into these classes but I know that I'm not going to get so lucky to get such permissions. Am I over-thinking this? Would they see the classes I took at a previous school, so long ago, and allow me to take these classes I want to take even since I won't be going for a specific degree? I just want to do my time and get these classes over with but picturing these scenarios of taking additional classes to just get into these are making me sweat.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hi! You should set up an appointment with a counselor at the CC to look over your transcript from your bachelors. If you already have a bachelor's degree you will be able to wave out of a lot of the pre-reqs for classes. Or, you may also be able to take placement tests. For example, I took multivariable calculus at a CC and I was able to wave out of the pre-reqs for the class with my high school course (AP Calc BC), but I had to get it signed off on by a counselor at the CC. They have a lot of prereqs in place because they don't want people to get in over their head, but there are definitely ways around them if you can test out or if you have already taken an equivalent class (as you likely have with a bachelors degree.) I would actually assume that you probably don't need the prereqs and can just jump right into the classes, but will likely need the approval of the CC counselor.",

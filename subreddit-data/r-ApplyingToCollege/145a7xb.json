The reason being that Harvard tends to defer majority of the students that they don\u2019t accept REA while Yale tends to reject majority of the people that they don\u2019t accept. This can help you determine how good of an applicant you actually are cause if you get deferred from yale then you know that you actually are a competitive applicant but if you get deferred from harvard you learn nothing.",

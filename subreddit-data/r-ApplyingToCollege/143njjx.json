    "postText": "am i the only one that thinks college tours change ur perspective of a school dramatically? \n\nI went to tour a school here in my city and while i have spent the last couple years saying i wouldn\u2019t even apply to the school, i now love it. There\u2019s many things that go into making ur decisions for where u want to apply and honestly i started out my day thinking i was just gonna see if i liked larger campuses or not but instead i wound up falling in love with what will be my safety school instead! \n\nWhile I would still love to go out of state to have more freedom, if I don\u2019t get in to other schools or get a nice aid package I will be fine staying here and that\u2019s okay. Still have another tour with a smaller school in my area but at least now i know what stuff i really value in a campus and that i\u2019m going to be fine no matter what. so my advice: tour the colleges in ur area, u may love them \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

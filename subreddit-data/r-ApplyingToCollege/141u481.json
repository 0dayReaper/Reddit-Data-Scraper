For example at my kids' HS, A+ in a regular class would be a 4.3 (+.3 for the \"+\"), and 5.3 in AP (an extra +1 for AP).\n\nAlthough if you are asking these questions, sounds like you are on the right track!",

If I have a 92 that\u2019s an A I. the class would colleges calculate it as a 3.7 GPA even though my school calls it a 4.0? But then again, they can\u2019t see the percentages so how would do that? I just feel kind of bad because my school does I flare our GPAS lol.",

For example, even in the same school two people could get different grades in the same class because they have different teachers. \n\nI think the important point is to try to optimize the things you can control and (this is the hard part) accept that there are some things that are out of your control.",

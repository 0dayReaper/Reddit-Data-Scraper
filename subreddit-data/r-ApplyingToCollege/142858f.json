    "postText": "Rising HS junior here. Been looking into what I could do post high school and community college looks like the best option for me; cheap two years and the ability to transfer to get a bachelors at a 4 year. It got me wondering why more people don't look at this option. Is transferring harder than all these yts make it seem? I go to a HS that is top 20 in the nation, making it their goal to get every kid to college. But I never hear any counselor, teacher, or just anyone in general talk about this option. Are these yt videos psyops trying to get me to waste two years of my life or do the faculty at my school work for the international banking cabal and want to enslave all students with debt?",

Also, some majors like CS don\u2019t have a clear transfer pathway at all, it\u2019s still competitive.\n\nTransferring from CCC to UC would be easier as a Cali resident.\n\nI think the answer is \u201cit depends\u201d esp on your major. So best idea would be to research each CCC to UC transfer process at each UC you\u2019re interested in. GL!",

There are situations like you\u2019re a Cali 4.0 kid and didn\u2019t get into any UCs you liked, or you\u2019re a 4.0 and DID get in, but your parents refuse to pay the $40k/yr in-state fees and you don\u2019t qualify for any aid, so you pick CC transfer option. I\u2019ve seen Cali kids pick these options.",

I don't really understand questions like this, \"hard\" is a very subjective comparison.\n\nIf you wish to transfer into a UC school, you can apply for a transfer via TAG (guaranteed transfer) or Pathways (specific major). Keep in mind that UCLA and UC Berkeley do not participate in the guaranteed transfer program, but the rest of the UCs do.\n\nUC schools also grant highest priority to California community college students, so you will certainly have an advantage on that front, but it still is not easy to transfer, and definitely hard to transfer into UCLA and UC Berkeley.",

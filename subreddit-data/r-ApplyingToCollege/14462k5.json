                    "comment": "I think there has been a lot of definition creep with the term \"spike\" over the years.\n\nThe most basic definition is just something that makes you stand out to admissions committees, and that could be an unusually well-developed passion that is not associated with any sorts of competitive awards or achievements.  Or some particularly unusual challenge you had to overcome, or so on.  Of course it could also be something competitive that you take to an unusually high level for a HS student--it just doesn't have to be.\n\nOver time it seems more and more applicants, at least the ones who are very active online, have focused on competitive/awards/achievement-type spikes, or things they hope will be impressive in a similar sense, like research, publications, starting businesses, creating apps, and so on.  The basic issue with that thinking is that so many ambitious HS kids are doing some form of that, that doesn't necessarily do all that much on its own to make a big difference, aside from (maybe) indicating a real passion for something.  Or maybe not, because admissions officers tend to be pretty savvy about people who are just trying to follow a formula designed to impress them, as opposed to throwing themselves into something they truly love.\n\nAnd again, if your passion is not for something which has a lot of competitions or awards and such associated with it, that doesn't mean admissions officers will find you less interesting than those other kids.  Indeed, you might well stand out more.\n\nOK, so the OP's passion is helping kids.  That's not the sort of thing which necessarily gets reflected in things like awards and competitions and such, and that is fine!  If OP has dedicated a lot of time and energy to this passion, then it can be a \"spike\" in the original sense, the sense which presumably matters.",

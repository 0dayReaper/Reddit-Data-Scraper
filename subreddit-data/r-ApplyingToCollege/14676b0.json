    "postText": "UCSD is one of the top feeder schools for USC pre-dental and that is one of the dental schools I highly consider. I heard undergrad prestige-ness does not matter when getting into dental school but I heard UCSD is more rigorous and challenging. \n\nWhich is the best school for the pre-dental route? Which could lead to the most opportunities if possible? ",

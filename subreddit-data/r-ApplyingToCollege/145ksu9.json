Going to Harvard or Wharton is most definitely correlated with higher amounts of wealth, and causation depends on circumstance. For those who were already wealthy and treading in their parents' paths, they were likely going to be wealthy anyways and there's probably not much causation, more like reverse causation. But for a FLGI student attending, they're likely to earn more because of it and there's probably causation.",

(as well as not enjoying life! contrary to people thinking the quote is nonsense, money does not buy happiness because love for materialistic things is largely ephemeral) yes, make money and live a sustainable life, but, don\u2019t make it for the sake of overindulgence. it\u2019s not everything, the point of life isn\u2019t to amass an abundance of riches and live lavishly.",

They open doors to high-paying employers (like consulting firms and banks) who recruit there. They give you opportunities to meet and network with successful peers. They give you a lifelong professional brand associated with the school. \n\nBut you have to do the actual work yourself. Many of the students who go there are the type of ambitious go-getters who will ultimately be monetarily successful. But those same go-getters can be found at most schools, and Ivy grads only make up a fraction of those in the highest income brackets.",

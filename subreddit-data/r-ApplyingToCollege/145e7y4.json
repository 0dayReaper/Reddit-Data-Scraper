    "postText": "This year, I took 5 AP/honors and 2 elective classes (newspaper and robotics) that are also extracurriculars with significant out of school involvement. This has caused my weighted GPA to be much lower than could have been.\n\nShould I have taken community college courses to increase my GPA? (I'm in California, so I could have). Im a rising senior, so there's still time.",

My daughter\u2019s 5.56 was not viewed as superior to those lowly sub-5.0 wGPAs.\n\nYour unweighted GPA, and even course-specific grades, along with course rigor, are looked at much more closely.",

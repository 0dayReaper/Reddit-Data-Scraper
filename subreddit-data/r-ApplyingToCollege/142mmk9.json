    "postText": "I have finished my freshman year of high school and I am wondering how am doing and what I can improve on. Please let me know if you need any more information or wanna ask some questions. Advice is what I\u2019m looking for don\u2019t hold back. I have a weighted 4.0 GPA. I\u2019m taking one AP class next year. I plan to continue to play varsity football for the next three  years of high school on top of the one I already have but will likely not plan to play at the college level. I have 20 hours of community service but nothing long term. So what did you all do that you think might benefit me or something you wished you did. I don\u2019t really have a dream school but I would like to go somewhere that challenges me.",

Without ruling any out at this point, of course.  And maybe have a talk with the parents about money.  That Might point out how cutthroat you have to be In fleshing out a resume.  Ivies or state U are vastly different in the approach to applying.",

            "comment": "congrats on finishing your freshman year. that in of itself is an achievement lol. \n\nnice job getting involved with things you\u2019re interested in and having high grades. i would say something important to keep in mind is quality over quantity. by all means, please do continue to get involved with things that interest you. with that being said, make sure to prioritize your true interests and put a lot of effort where your interests lie. this could mean getting leadership positions in extracurriculars, taking initiative for your community service projects, or even starting your own niche group for something you\u2019re passionate about (if you truly wanted to). \n\noverall for college applications a few years from now, i would recommend to start thinking of your passions right now and demonstrate that through your personal life. this is what i would argue is the key to getting into a top university (im speaking as a rising 3rd year at UCLA). when you do this, you can not only do things that you enjoy but you\u2019re also able to stand out from applicants with generic applications (high grades, lots of extracurriculars, high test scores, but no hooks or wow factors). \n\nas far as stats are concerned, keep doing what you\u2019re doing. build up good study habits to keep your GPA high, continue to amp up your course load with honors and AP classes that interest you and you feel that you can do well in. When I was in hs, I did almost every AP or honors class available unless I had a scheduling conflict with a different AP/honors class. \n\ntake this all with a grain of salt, but i think this would be a nice approach to keep in mind over the next two years so that you\u2019ll be in great shape to start the application process at the start of your senior year / the summer before.",

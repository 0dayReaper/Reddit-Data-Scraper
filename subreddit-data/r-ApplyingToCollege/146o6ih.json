    "postText": "Rising senior here\n\nEdit: I intend to major in Aerospace Engineering / Mechanical Engineering depending on the school\n\nI\u2019m still having a concern that my 3.74 UW GPA is the main factor that I believe will get me rejected from my dream school (UPenn). I will likely apply ED for MEAM and try to write the absolute best essays I possibly can. I\u2019m leaning towards my personal essay being about how aviation has captivated me throughout my entire life and my future dreams of aviation. My LORs may be above average and not exactly special. \n\nThat leaves my ECs, which are not at all prestigious or have made headlines or anything, but I believe they may be unique enough (trying to show my strong passion for aviation and fairly heavy on leadership). Based on this sub Ivies seem to love insanely prestigious ECs and awards. \n\nRealistically, do I still have a shot at getting in?\n\nYes, of course I have my safety (CSULB)\n\nLIST\n\nCSULB, Cal Poly SLO, Cal Poly Pomona, SDSU, UCSD, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UCI, UC Davis, UW Seattle, Purdue, Stanford, UPenn\n\nEdit: my gpa had an upward trend until 2nd sem junior year where I got a B- and a B \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nNote: I\u2019ll be a legacy applicant, but I try not to think of this too much because I don\u2019t want a mentality thinking that I\u2019ll get in just because of legacy, which I know is untrue. I try to compare myself to other unhooked applicants",

            "comment": "Penn is a reach but not so much I would advise you not to even try.  You seem to be doing what you can to maximize your chances.  I note I think think a lot of the online conversation about admissions to schools like Penn tends to overemphasize the importance of \"prestigious\" ECs and underemphasize the importance of coming across as having very good character traits (in terms of leadership, kindness, social skills, and so on).\n\nBut anyway, there are a lot of schools that fit between Penn and CSULB in terms of selectivity.  Is your interest in aviation being a pilot, an engineer, working on the business side, or so on?  Of course it is OK if you don't know yet.  Purdue, for example, offers a broad range of programs for people interested in different aspects of the aviation industry (they have a whole school devoted to it).\n\nA whole bunch of other public universities have specific aviation programs too--I think Auburn, Baylor, Oklahoma, Kansas State, some less well-known generally like Western Michigan and North Dakota, and so on.  I'm not sure how competitive admissions might be in all these cases, but I would think you could fill out an exciting list (for an aviation person) of additional reach/target/likelies.",

In that case I\u2019d do bachelors in mechanical and then a masters in aerospace somewhere else. I have other schools like UCSD, Cal Poly Slo, and Cal Poly Pomona on my list",

Take SAT or ACT; see if you can get a score in range for Penn, which would be reassuring for the admissions office. (Applying test optional with a GPA you feel is low for the college is not a recipe for success.)\n\nYour essay should demonstrate something about you, a personal quality of some sort, that would make Penn want you on campus.\n\nAs the others mentioned, develop a full list of reaches, matches, and safeties.",

Since a rational college list is comprised of reaches, targets, and likely colleges, you could certainly use Penn as one of your reaches and give it your best shot.  But do make sure to put time and effort into finding a slate of targets and safeties that you can afford and would be happy to attend.  Good luck!",

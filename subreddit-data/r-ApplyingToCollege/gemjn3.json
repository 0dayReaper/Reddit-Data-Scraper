I run track (shout out to all the runners and other athletes I've seen posting here!!). I love art, musicals, playing games, having political debates, going to the movies, and anything athletic! I'm a huge fan of the Office and Hamilton! I am part of my school's robotics (FRC 1337420), Science Olympiad, and running teams. I spent my last summer doing research in electrical and computer engineering and can't wait for the opportunity to be a part of the incredible research going on at [COLLEGE]! I love reading all the posts in this group as you are all such interesting people, and I can't wait to meet you all through Zoom!",

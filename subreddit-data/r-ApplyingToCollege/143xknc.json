    "postText": "My kid brother got a full tuition, housing, and meal plan ride to his school. But it was thanks to his college advisor while he was in high school. His advisor did something to arrange the jump from high school to college.\n\nSo now I'm like, what exactly do college advisors do? Because I'm not in high school anymore so I probably don't have the option of asking a college advisor to do whatever my brother's college advisor did. But maybe I can do it for myself? Has that ever been done? What would someone have to do for a college to reach out to them and be like \"Please come to our school, we'll pay for everything?\" \n\nIf it's recent academic performance that gets colleges reaching out to you, what about grad school? What if I do really well for my Bachelor's, could I turn that into grad school offers for my Master's? If so, how? Because unlike high school, it's probably a conflict of interest for any advisor at a college to help their best students go to other colleges.",

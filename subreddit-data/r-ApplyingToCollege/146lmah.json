I want to pursue a degree in business or a degree in which I can quickly get a job after graduating uni, can somebody guide me which universities I can apply to? And if majoring in business would be a good idea? Will a gap year hurt my chances?",

You\u2019ll have to find an employer willing to sponsor you and this is usually a STEM visa for a few years. So CS and engineering grads are the ones who usually get it.",

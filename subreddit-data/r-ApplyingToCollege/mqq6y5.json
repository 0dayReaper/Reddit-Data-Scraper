In fact, just as almost no people have the exact same DNA sequences, it is unlikely that there are any people with the exact same gender.\n\nYou can think of gender as a pole, with one end being \"male\" and the other being \"female.\" The majority of people cluster around one of these two ends, but no one's position is exactly the same. Then there is a minority of people who are spread about across the pole; these are the non-binary genders.\n\nSex is also not a strict binary. There are intersex people, who are born with parts of both genetalia, chromosomal and hormonal combinations, and other such irregularities. However, over 99% of people have either the male or female sex, so this should be easier for you to wrap your mind around. But gender and sex are not the same thing \u2014 sex is physical, chromosomal, and hormonal, while gender is psychological, neurological, and social \u2014 so not everybody is aligned exactly with their sex on the gender spectrum, or gender pole.\n\nContraPoints has a video you may be interested in [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bbINLWtMKI).",

I do agree that feet are simply feet the way that women just are women if thats what you mean. Also, yes thats the way the english language has been taken. male is a sex word and man is a common gender identity. if youre still not into these words used in this way let me give you an example of why they're useful like this. lets say youre a female, but you dont like makeup and you like to have short hair. you're into powerlifting and were varsity kicker on the football team in highschool. when people ask you questions like \"why don't you wear makeup, youd be so pretty\" or make comments like \"your muscles make you look like a man\"(queue confused/mildly disgusted looking face), or maybe its just the stares you know are covering up their internal judgements, you feel like you don't belong - like the way that you are isn't good enough or that you're wrong in some way. but it isn't wrong, thats who you are, these things i've mentioned are only considered masculine by chance. the same type of chance that determined who you are. biology just worked out that way. maybe this person, after consistantly getting negative feedback for being the way that they are - while seeing \"men\" living their lives the same way with no repurcussions - will begin to feel extremely dysphoric, unfomfortable in their own skin, and for that person it may make their life more digestible to simply identify as a man so they can be true to themselves without other people treating them like some sort of weirdo. literally none of this labeling would be neccessary if everyone was simply themselves and no one expected things of people just because of their hormones and genitals - but we aren't there yet. you can flip this example and have a feminine male too, whos particularly non-normative. this male feels extremely happy and excited to wear dresses. they love to tend their garden, and grow exotic flowers. they bake. idk, they do \"girly\" stuff - whatever that means. if you think my examples seem weird and arbitrary or think \"playing football doesn't make you a man\" or \"wearing a dress doesnt make you a woman\" well you've just arrived to the point. having a penis or vagina may have some bearing on who you are but theyre not the end all be all determining factor here. its way more complicated and people are all individuals. some people fall further outside of whats considered \"normal\"(being trans is normal by the way. as in this is just a thing, just like its normal for a small fraction of the population to have green eyes. its just not the average usual thing.) and thats alright. we can just let everyone be themselves. this includes not shaming males for being disinterested in athletics. they arent less of a man. this includes women who dont want to have kids or wear makeup or anything else women are \"supposed\" to do. theyre not less of a woman for it. this even includes people who have a hodgepodge mix-bag of feminine and masculine traits and hobbies and whatever else you think adds up to be your personality. you dont have to be defined by your genitals everyone deserves to be themselves judgement-free and right now that means beginning by respecting how people would like to be referred to. imagine if I called you bob(or another name that isnt your own) all the time despite that not being your name just because ive invented a rule that says everyone with (insert your pinky finger length) long pinkies is a bob now and bobs are to act this way. youd be like \"what the fuck? you can't tell me who i am\". its the same reason racism is wrong, you just can not reliably go around generalizing people based on arbitrary unchosen qualities. it isn't how you want to be treated. you're valid the way you are like everyone else.",

    "postText": "Hey, so I recently committed to Columbia but have been having second thoughts. One of the main points of contention for me is that I will be going to Columbia College, which only awards bachelor of arts degrees, as a STEM major. I couldn't find any applicable major for medical school in SEAS so I just applied to Columbia College. I am concerned that having a bachelor of arts only could impact my future career especially if I go into a primarily STEM field such as medicine or suddenly have the urge to switch to engineering. So, would having a bachelor of arts vs bachelor of science impact any of my prospects?",

Since almost no universities mandate classical languages anymore, the distinction is almost totally meaningless. Columbia is one of the few places where the distinction makes any sense: the BA indicates that someone has taken the full humanities core that\u2019s the hallmark of a Columbia education, and the engineering school\u2019s BS indicates compliance with the licensing requirements of professional engineers.",

            "comment": "unlike what other people said there is a difference, very niche but still important to note. For engineering degrees the only accreditation that matters is ABET. These accreditations are why so much of the engineering curriculum is similar for the first two years for any discipline. The required science and math courses come from this. ABET accredition and BAs are mutually exclusive. The ABET accredition is necessary because it is required to get a PE license which would be required for certain consulting and government works but beyond that it also just proves that you went through much rigour and gives an engineering degree its respect. Of course as time goes on people are caring less about this as BAs are paralleling the same rigour just in different ways. Personally I don't think it matters that much unless you want to do civil engineering in which it case it would matter a lot because that is where that PE license is needed most.\n\nBasically, it doesnt matter unless you are doing civil engineering or other niche engineering scenarios. For other disciplines, who cares? Completing an engineering degree in the first place is just a way of saying you can work hard since you don't use 90% of it in work anyway.",

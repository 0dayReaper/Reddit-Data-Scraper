So what makes an applicant stand out and get admission compared to every other person applying? It\u2019s so confusing to me on how they just pick people based on grades?",

            "comment": "Despite not having holistic admissions, the CSUs consider a combination of grades and other factors. For freshman, this is called a 'multi-factor' admissions criteria, while for transfers, it is a bit less formalized with a focus on major transfer requirements, grades, and whether a transfer is a local applicant or not (at CSULA, for example, local transfers are specifically from one of several nearby community colleges). \n\nBut yes, it is mostly grades and course selection.",

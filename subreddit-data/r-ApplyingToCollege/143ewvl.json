    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm applying to a few \"T20s\" and wanted to know how important it'll be to have community service. I've got really good ECs except I'm missing community service. I had planned to do it last year but couldn't get any time to do so and this year the NGO I'd contacted hasn't told me whether I can start coming or not despite me mailing them over a month ago and calling them a few days ago too. Idk what I can do. It's not like I've not helped people before w studies (I was planning to teach underprivileged children and was actually looking forward to it but idk why that NGO isn't responding).",

This was the only time it would have been recorded. I don't need to be guilt tripped about helping out when I have helped out for free. The only way my previous help may be acknowledged is if the university contacted the exact people who received the resources (not rlly possible NGL, loads of impoverished people in my country)",

But everything can help.\n\nSo sure, you can get into a T10 with no community service, if you are a D1 football player or went to the Olympics in ice dancing. Those are obviously extreme examples, but the point is that you don't have to be a cookie cutter applicant. But you do have to have something to offer the school.",

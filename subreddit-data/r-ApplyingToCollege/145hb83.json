If your choice was between taking an extra study hall or being a teacher's assistant, I would choose to be an assistant. However, if you had the option to take an AP course, I think that is more favorably looked upon than being a teacher's assistant. Colleges value rigorous course loads.",

Our teacher is really good and we regularly place well. This year, one TA got 1st, another got 3rd, one more got 4th. I want to develop a submittable app as well and the teacher recommended I be a teacher's assistant because I performed really well in his class.",

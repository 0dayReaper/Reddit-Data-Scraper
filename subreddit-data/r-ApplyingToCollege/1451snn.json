    "postText": "These are the things currently on my summer list:\n\nA. Observing research at a local university (a very good one in my state, and decent in this developing country): Also how much more of a benefit doing this for 2 weeks over 1 month have?\n\nB. Schoolwork\n\nC. College list and Essays\n\nD. I'll also be doing a summer program simultaneously with school when it starts so I'm also trying to study ahead.\n\nE. A community service organisation (that requires me to travel a few hours)\n\nI didn't start A but the background work for E is done. Can you please help me decide how important each one is and how I should prioritise them?\n\nI'm trying to do all this because I don't have good/many ECs previously but I'm still aiming for t30\n\n(I have a little less than a month until school starts.)",

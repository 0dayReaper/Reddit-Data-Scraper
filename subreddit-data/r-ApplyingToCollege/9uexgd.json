    "postText": "This doesn't affect us seniors (thank god) but starting next year they're gonna require students to register for AP tests in the fall. For most people, if they get into an early school, they will only take the tests that that school accepts for credit, but I guess the College Board wanted to put a stop to that. They're using the excuse that it's so \"students can commit to CoLLeGe-LeVeL wOrK early in the school year\", but I'm pretty sure we all know the real rea$on\n\nEdit: Here's a link https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/ap-2019/why-are-we-making-changes\n\nEdit 2: While we're at it, just a reminder that the College Board's CEO made $1.3M in 2009, and nineteen of its executives make more than $300,000 a year. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board#Criticism) some other fun stuff about how great the nOt-FoR-pRoFiT College Board is",

It completely screwed me out of one AP test that I was going to self-study for, Calc BC, since it rushed the entire process and it was already too difficult trying to navigate everything else... there's also like a fucking $40 late fee barely a week after the deadline had past. I _highly_ doubt that CollegeBoard (or my high school) suffered any financial losses or threats by a student paying their fees less than 10 days after the \"deadline\" (which I doubt is actually a deadline but rather some arbitrary date they stamp on there). \n\nEvery single AP teacher of mine hates this new system. And not because it's new and is just taking adjusting to... but because it's flatout robbery. Like, the deadline to drop out of a course without a W (aka the grace period) barely passed a week or two ago... meaning that people, at this point, don't even know wtf they're doing at this point of the year, yet they're being forced to pay hundreds for a test months away. \n\nAt this point, I just wanna tell CB to fuck itself and then take all duel-enrollment or cc courses, but they know that's not realistic. \n\nJust to be clear, I did try warning some of you guys that this was gonna happen lol (for the people whose schools aren't doing the trial).

My son took an online English class and his transcripts don\u2019t show it was online and semester college classes count as a year for high school purposes. It was the General Freshman comp class everyone takes but it counted as a 5th year of English which schools like Cal Poly prefer. \n\nThey found CC classes to be a lot easier than AP, less time consuming and the high school allowed them to only take 4 classes so they were able to accommodate the college classes. \n\nWhen it was time to apply for internships they looked great because they ad over 40 units of college credit when they started college. It was a far superior experience to an AP education. The only AP classes kids should take are science because those are too hard to take at a CC",

It is clearly designed solely to extort additional fees from the students.  Any student who is interested in studying hard and learning the material will do regardless of when they commit.  Adding extra pressure right from the start of the class is unproductive and could be detrimental.  It is far better to allow a student time to learn as much as they can and if they feel they've mastered the material then they can take the test - to force the issue benefits no-one but you.  Many students, myself included years ago, took AP classes for the material and the extra point on UC admission in addition to the credit.  In fact, my parents suggested that I not transfer the credit because by taking the normal college-level classes students can ease a bit into college rather than skipping to more difficult classes right away.  Your own research indicates only a single additional 3+ score (3.3%) - not enough of a benefit to justify the expense and stress.  I urge you to consider the students and not your bottom-line.\n\n==",

If someone is charging you to complete this application it means they are likely scamming you or providing \"consultation\" services in which you are paying for. Honestly the application is designed for someone who knows nothing about financial aid to complete it and any question you have can be answered by the financial aid office of the college you will be attending for free. If you live in california you can check out your local cash4college workshops where you can get one on one assistance in completing your application for free at cash4college.csac.ca.gov.",

            "comment": "If your state offers something similar to Ohio's College Credit Plus (CCP) program there's no reason to ever take an AP class, you can just take the actual college class. In Ohio anyone 13 and over who can pass the college entrance exam can take college classes -- tuition, fees, and books on the State's dime. If a college is not close, the school has to provide space and time to the student to take the class either online or as taught by a qualified on-site teacher.  My child started at 14, 9th grade, and graduated high school with over 100 college credit hours.  Take advantage of the real thing if it's available!",

They wouldn't  automatically  take that, I had to do a placement test and repeated some calc.  \n\nAP stats?  They gave me credit *for a non-majors* intro to stats class.  So that wasn't  worth shit.  I still had to take stats in college after calculus.\n\nI did get out of all but one class for the transfer credits for dual enrollment.  Those counted for equivalent classes, save for the one exception.\n\nPoint being, the AP tests I took in high school didn't  get me any useful credits towards my major, my minor, nor college graduation.  The AP classes themselves were worthwhile, I just ain't  so sure about paying to take those exams.\n",

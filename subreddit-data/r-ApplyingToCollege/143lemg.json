The idea of the personal statement is to give the reader an idea of your personality and best character traits through a hopefully interesting, funny, or compelling essay.  If you spend too much time discussing activities that you\u2019ve described elsewhere, you sacrifice space that might better be used to show the reader that you have the qualities they want in a student.",

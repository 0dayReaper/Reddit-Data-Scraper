    "postText": "\nHey everyone, I really want to become an ultrasound tech but I\u2019m unsure what kind of degree that will help me become one. I\u2019m currently set to attend a university to major in physics with a concentration in radiological health. This mostly focuses on the physics part of ionizing radiation inside and outside the healthcare setting. After doing more research, it looks like most ultrasound techs have pursued a DMS degree. Can I still be an ultrasound tech if I have a bachelors in physics or would it be a waste of time? Should I try to look for schools that offer degrees in DMS?",

            "comment": "You do not need a BS in physics to become an ultrasound tech. Associates degree and certification are all you need. You'd be massively over qualified.\n\nIf you are interested in physics and healthcare, I would suggest working towards becoming a medical physicist. It is a great career and there is a dire shortage of them.

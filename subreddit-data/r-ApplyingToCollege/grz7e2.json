I wonder if browser extensions had any play in some of these issues, ones that inject their own scripts, potentially preventing Collegeboard's submit button script and other functions from operating properly. Rip to all of you test-takers that went through this, I guess you got a free authentic trial run.",

At the end of the day, each browser is sending a HTTP request with the payload of a students response to the server.\n\nWhat JavaScript runtime the browser used doesn't influence anything. I would think that CB asked students to use Chrome because it's stable, widely used, and familiar to the students, but 100% certainly not for its JavaScript runtime.",

When you click the submit button, the page sends out a HTTP request using browser JavaScript including the submission and other diagnostic data.\n\nThe CB server uses nodejs and simply parses the HTTP request. The JavaScript runtimes do not \"talk\" directly to each other, it's only the HTTP request containing the submission that's sent. \n\nA HTTP request is the same, whether it's produced by Mozilla's spidermonkey, Chrome's V8, or Edge's Chakra, so nodejs doesn't act differently if the request was formulated by a different runtime. **when it arrives at CB's servers, it's exactly the same no matter what runtime the browser uses** because http requests are pretty universal. Hope that makes sense lol\n\nEdit: don't think of them as connected systems, think of it like two people trying to talk over a phone.",

The run times are only there to facilitate certain Javascript functionality as prescribed by the appropriate web standards.\n\nBrowser extensions can modify certain elements on a web page, or prevent certain events from firing in the DOM, and they could certainly inject their own javascript that might trigger Collegeboard's anticheat (if they even have it)\n\nHow their site works is that on the client side (the web page), there is certain information that you enter, i.e. the file, or the text you pasted in. This has nothing to do with Chrome or the V8 engine, it'll work on just about any given runtime. Since the site used React, what was most likely the case was that your uploaded data was saved as a blob or file object in state, then that state was controlled by the submit button.\n\nGenerally, clicking the button would prompt a POST or PUT request to a certain college board endpoint. Or, it could've triggered some sort of validation before sending off your answer to their servers.\n\nTheir servers could be running in Node, Ruby, hell they could even be running on COBOL. It doesn't matter since you're just sending data back and forth using a standardized data format (JSON, XML, etc).\n\nWhat most likely happened was that the submit button's action either got blocked by ad block, which is known to happen since some adblock will attempt to prevent certain actions that they deem to be spam/dangerous pop ups.\n\nAnother possibility is that the CB has some sort of server-side validation they run your response through before submitting, and upon clicking the button, they ran the validation and it didn't return a positive result.\n\nAnd, just speculating here since we don't know much about their submission endpoints, it is also possible that they were running on a single EC2 instance or something and couldn't scale properly.\n\nIn this case, let's say that you click submit with like 1 minute left. It sends a request to the server, which is put on hold since the server is busy. When the server finally gets to your request, 1 minute may have already passed, and since the server probably checks current time when it processes your submission, it would get rejected even though you submitted it 1 minute before the deadline. Again, all speculation, but this is what I think are some of the main issues - caused partially by user error (i.e. adblock), and also by poor technology choices by the CB.",

The 1% means 1% of all tests. However, I think that if you look specifically at tests that were more likely to have photo submissions, that number goes up. Photos are more easily corrupted, so there would be more issues there. Photos are also larger files, so servers are more likely to be overwhelmed if the majority submissions are photos. This means that science exams, math exams, the music theory exam, and other exams that need photos will have a much higher percentage of failed submissions.",

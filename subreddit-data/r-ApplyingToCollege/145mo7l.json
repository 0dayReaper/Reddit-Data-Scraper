    "postText": "I am aware that a lot of the time you submit senior year grades to colleges. But do they really matter? They won\u2019t affect my GPA, so colleges will only see them from my transcript. Also, if I apply EA/ED to all my schools, will colleges see senior year grades at all? And if they do, will it just be like they just want to make sure I\u2019m not failing any classes or will they really regard it as seriously as the other years? \n\nI\u2019ve been a straight A student all of high school, would it hurt me to get Bs as a senior if I am only applying EA or will that not matter?",

Some were specific in stating that if I anticipated earning a C or below in my final semester to contact them in advance. \nBasically if you went from all As to all\nBs they might ask you to explain. If you drop further they can rescind your offer ( but it\u2019s rare as far as I know).",

Even if you apply all EA/ED, you could be deferred to the RD round or waitlisted.\n\nRD schools will surely see your first term grades.\n\nAny school you are waitlisted on will see at least your first term grades and maybe more.\n\nSo senior year is *not* the time to slack off.",

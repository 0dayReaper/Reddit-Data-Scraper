            "comment": "A budget of $35k will be tough to satisfy at any school other than a public school in the state where you live \\*unless\\* you get a discount, either in the form of financial aid or merit scholarship.\n\nSo, other than the handful of non-Georgia schools where \"full price\" is still within your budget, your question is basically \"where can I get a discount that will bring my out-of-pocket down to $35k\".\n\nThat's going to depend on:\n\n1. How strong your application is, and\n2. What your financial aid situation is.\n\nIn the category of \"places where full price is within your budget\" you might look at Iowa State.  Full price COA is roughly $35k.  University of Kansas is about $38k.  Nebraska is about $39k.\n\nIn the category of \"places that might give you a big merit discount\" that's going to be highly dependent on how strong your application is, but some of the usual suspects are Alabama, Arizona State, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ole Miss, Texas Tech, Oklahoma State, Miami of Ohio.  Plus many more.  The stronger your application the more likely you are to get a discount at these schools (and any others) and the larger that discount is likely to be.",

Reducing tuition to the in-state rate is basically part of the scholarship.  Lots of schools in Texas do this.  Florida State also has a thing where they give in-state tuition to a subset of their out-of-state admits using some automatic grades/scores based cutoffs that change from year to year (and aren't announced in advance).\n\nSome schools have specific scholarships for specific neighboring states where part of the award is in-state tuition.  For instance, the University of Arkansas gives in-state tuition to applicants from Texas if their stats are high enough.",

    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI plan to major in Computer Science or Engineering(Mechanical, Electric, Computer... haven't decided yet), and pick the other as a minor.\n\nMy grades are mostly A and A+ in hard classes except for D- in history which is going to stick out like a thorn.  SAT - 1470, but can get it up to 1540.\n\nI have an active history, taking part in many competitions, and being the founder of the physics club in my school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat colleges would make for a good safety list? I would like something that won't leave me in debt, and would very much enjoy study-abroad programs.",

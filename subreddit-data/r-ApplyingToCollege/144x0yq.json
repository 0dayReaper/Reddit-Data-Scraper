It\u2019s known for having a stellar pre-med program, with a very flexible curriculum that allows you to take plenty of \u201cjust for fun\u201d classes in various departments. There are lots of opportunities for interdisciplinary studies,  which I can talk more about if you\u2019d like. Lots of lab opportunities, including the ability to do research at the #5 med school in the country in your first semester freshman year. I could talk on and on about the interdisciplinary programs as well. There\u2019s one called Medicine and Society that might interest you. I\u2019m going to make another comment with other recs as well.",

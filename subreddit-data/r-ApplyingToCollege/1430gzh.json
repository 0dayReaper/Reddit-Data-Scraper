            "comment": "As you said, the most obvious way to relate to your teachers is to talk a bit in class, both asking and responding to questions. This means of communicating is usually the most natural to students. \n\nThe second factor is the behavior your teacher observes.  Are you particularly helpful or organized during group projects?  Are you enthusiastic and attentive in class?  Are you kind to your classmates?  Are you methodical and observant during labs? \n\nThe third means of communicating is your classwork.  Do you take essays and projects to the next level?  Do you write well?  Do you have a more sophisticated understanding of literature or economics than is typical at your age? \n\nFinally, does your teacher know you at all outside of class?   Do you come in after school or during breaks to seek help or clarify points?  Have you stopped by to explain how much you enjoyed a particular lesson or liked (or even disliked) an assigned book?  Learning to approach favorite high school teachers for a quick chat is a very helpful skill since you\u2019ll want to develop mentorships with a couple of favorite college professors.  Most people become teachers or professors because they enjoy talking to students.  Ask about favorite books in their subject, other classes they would recommend, their college experience, colleges about which they\u2019ve heard good things, whether they like teaching\u2026 anything really.  Good luck!",

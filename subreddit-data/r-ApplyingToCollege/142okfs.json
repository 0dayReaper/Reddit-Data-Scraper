    "postText": "I keep thinking about the amount of loans I\u2019ll have to take out, even though it\u2019s a state school. I keep thinking about the fact that I\u2019ve already had to switch roommates once because they weren\u2019t willing to live with someone in a wheelchair accessible room. I keep thinking about how difficult campus is to navigate in a wheelchair. I keep thinking about how I have no idea what my health will look like come august. Part of me thinks I should stick to my original plan, live on campus, but take all my classes online. But the other part of me thinks going to community college and living with a family member, while working part time, and working towards a paramedic or physical therapy assistant degree is the way to go. I\u2019ve had extensive talks with family members who have told me, that I should start at community college to make the transition easier. We don\u2019t have a clue what my health will look like, and I like the idea of a smaller environment, where I can have help, and not just be a number. I just don\u2019t want my parents to be disappointed in me, or try to get me to go to community college around home. My grandma is getting older, and needs some help with things, so I\u2019m thinking about asking her if I could live with her while taking classes. \n\nI would have family nearby no matter what option, so that\u2019s not a factor.",

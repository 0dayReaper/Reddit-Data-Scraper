The easiest way to get a guess at this is to use the net price calculators for a few of the institutions, and see if they have no-loan guarantees.  To be sure, apply and see what happens.\n\nAlso, be careful with Columbia.  They have a School of General Studies for people who have been out of formal education for a while, but it has much worse financial aid packages than their other undergraduate colleges.",

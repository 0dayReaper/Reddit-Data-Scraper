    "postText": "A little while ago, I came across this 2017 article from the New York Times: [Some Colleges Have More\nStudents From the Top 1 Percent Than the Bottom 60](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html). It includes a tool that you can use to look up any college and see how it compares to its peers--e.g., [here's the one for WashU](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/washington-university-in-st-louis). I think it's fascinating. \n\nUsing the aforementioned tool, I put together a table (whose formatting was marred by Reddit) that re-ranks the Top 20-ish universities in terms of the ratio of 1%-ers (students from families in the top percentile of wealth) to bottom 20% (students from families in the bottom 20% of wealth). The \"average income\" column represents the average family income for students at a school. I also included the endowment-per-student amount for each school using [this website](https://www.reachhighscholars.org/college_endowments.html). I added Michigan and UVA because I wanted a couple more public schools and CMU because it's often included in the T20.\n\n**(a)** 1%ers divided by\r Bottom 20%, **(b)** 1%ers, **(c)** Bottom 20%, **(d)** Average Income, **(e)** Endowment Per Student:\r  \n1.\t\t**UCLA**: (a) 0.5 | (b) 4.2% | (c) 8.3% | (d) $104,900 | (e) &lt;$100k\r  \n2.\t\t**Berkeley**: (a) 0.52 | (b) 3.8% | (c) 7.3%| (d) $119,900 | (e) &lt;$100k\r  \n3.\t\t**MIT**: (a) 0.92\t | (b) 5.7% | (c) 6.2%| (d) $137,400 | (e) $2,445,993\r  \n4.\t\t**Cal Tech**: (a) 1.0 | (b) 3% | (c) 2.9%| (d) $146,300 | (e) $1,587,401\r  \n5.\t\t**Chicago**: (a) 1.8 | (b) 10% | (c) 5.5%| (d) $134,500 | (e) $628,658\r  \n6.\t\t**Carnegie Mellon**: (a) 1.8 | (b) 7% | (c) 4%| (d) $154,700 | (e) $273,609\r  \n7.\t\t**Rice**: (a) 2.0 | (b) 9.8% | (c) 4.9%| (d) $160,800 | (e) $1,107,012\r  \n8.\t\t**Columbia**: (a) 2.5\t| (b) 13% | (c) 5.1%| (d) $150,900 | (e) $429,473\r  \n9.\t\t**Cornell**: (a) 2.6 | (b) 10% | (c) 3.8%| (d) $151,600 | (e) $390,732\r  \n10.\t\t**Michigan**: (a) 2.6 | (b) 9.3% | (c) 3.6%| (d) $154,000 | (e) &lt;$100k\r  \n11.\t\t**Virginia**: (a) 3.0 | (b) 8.5% | (c) 2.8%| (d) $155,500 | (e) &lt;$100k\r  \n12.\t\t**Harvard**: (a) 3.3 | (b) 15% | (c) 4.5%| (d) $168,800 | (e) $2,187,041\r  \n13.\t\t**Johns Hopkins**: (a) 3.8 | (b) 11% | (c) 2.9%| (d) $177,300 | (e) $388,137\r  \n14.\t\t**Northwestern**: (a) 3.8 | (b) 14% | (c) 3.7%| (d) $171,200 | (e) $712,307\r  \n15.\t\t**Stanford**: (a) 4.3 | (b) 17% | (c) 4%| (d) $167,500 | (e) $2,493,897\r  \n16.\t\t**Brown**: (a) 4.6 | (b) 19% | (c) 4.1%| (d) $204,200 | (e) $655,426\r  \n17.\t\t**Duke**: (a) 4.9 | (b) 19% | (c) 3.9%| (d) $186,700 | (e) $756,405\r  \n18.\t\t**Penn**: (a) 5.8 | (b) 19% | (c) 3.3%| (d) $195,500 | (e) $891,166\r  \n19.\t\t**Princeton**: (a) 7.7 | (b) 17% | (c) 2.2%| (d) $186,100 | (e) $4,589,980\r  \n20.\t\t**Dartmouth**: (a) 8.1 | (b) 21% | (c) 2.6%| (d) $200,400 | (e) $1,283,927\r  \n21.\t\t**Yale**: (a) 9.0 | (b) 19% | (c) 2.1%| (d) $192,600 | (e) $3,517,420\r  \n22.\t\t**Notre Dame**: (a) 9.4 | (b) 15% | (c) 1.6%| (d) $191,400 | (e) $1,411,082\r  \n23.\t\t**Vanderbilt**: (a) 12.1 | (b) 23% | (c) 1.9%| (d) $204,500 | (e) $807,307\r  \n24.\t\t**WashU**: (a) 22+ | (b) 22% | (c) &lt;1%| (d) $272,000 | (e) $871,099\n\nUsing Brown as an example, (b) shows that 19% of its student body comes from the top 1%. (c) shows that 4.1% of its student body comes from the bottom 20%. (a) shows that the former divided by the latter equals \"4.6\". (d) shows that the average family income at Brown is $204,200. And (e) shows that its endowment per student is $655,426. At least, this was the Brown data in 2013 per the NYT.\r\n\n**Caveats:** I wish I could disaggregate that data further. I'd prefer to use something like the ratio of a school's percentage of students in the top 5% of wealth vs. those in bottom 75%, but the NYT's tool, as insightful as it is, doesn't provide such details. I'd want more data on middle-class representation at these schools, as opposed to the super rich vs. the poor. Further, this data is now a decade old. It's possible there have been major shifts since 2013, although I kind of doubt it. Universities have the institutional maneuverability of cruise ships, not jet skis. Also, I'm not advocating that people boycott any particular school or anything. My kid is seriously considering a school in the bottom portion of the list. While that school's rich-to-poor ratio is abysmal, it offers great financial aid and may be too good to pass up if it offers admission. So, draw your own conclusions. And I acknowledge that kids from wealthy parents are always going to have inherent advantages the make them over represented in America's top schools. Of course, I don't think that should be held against anybody, but I personally think that giving these already-immensely-privileged people that additional privilege of legacy-consideration is . . . well . . . gross. Anyhow, I have many more caveats, but I'll try to reduce the tedium by not including them.\n\n**Losers:** WashU. The data is harsh. WashU has more than 22 times as many students from the top 1% as the bottom 20%. It also has the richest kids by a large margin. WashU's average student is roughly twice as rich as MIT's or Chicago's. Despite a massive endowment and despite its immediate proximity to poverty (East St. Louis, Fergusson, etc.), WashU is unmistakably a school for the rich but not the poor. It beats out other schools in nearly every metric, often by a large margin. Perhaps WashU has improved--I think it has since instituted need-blind admissions and become a QuestBridge school--but, otherwise, woof. *Dishonorable Mention*: Yale was also a surprise. It's in a city and has an outrageous endowment, and yet it's the least poor-friendly Ivy. \n\n**Winners:** UCLA and Berkeley win. Unlike private universities, most public universities have a legislatively enforced duty to serve their states/communities. That duty generally trumps other goals like growing a school's endowment or protecting its prestige in rankings. Still, UCLA and Berkeley beat other public schools like Michigan and UVA handily. MIT and Cal Tech also come off extremely well. Is STEM a great social equalizer? I doubt it because Harvey Mudd would be mid-pack on the list above. In any event, my hat is off to MIT and Cal Tech. *Honorable mention*: Chicago, CMU, and Rice.\n\n**Quick Observations:** Of the top 10 on this ranking, only 3 schools consider legacy (Chicago, Columbia, and Cornell) in admissions. I could be wrong, but I think either the vast majority or even all of the other schools in the list above have legacy-preferences in varying degrees.  Also, at least in the T20, there doesn't seem to be any correlation between economic diversity and endowment. I understand that there is a business side to higher education such that many schools simply cannot afford to offer generous financial aid packages to lower-income students. That doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\n**LACs?** I didn't put together a separate table, but it seems like most LACs are slightly more rich-friendly, poor-adverse than universities. The WASP schools would seemingly fit within the middle of the table above. But the LACs in the 6 to 30-ish range? They're generally closer to WashU and Vanderbilt. Props to Wellesley and Smith though, which are notable exceptions.",

            "comment": "I am pretty sure many of the private universities would argue (maybe not in these words) that a steady relationship with multiple generations of wealthier families explains how they can end up providing such generous financial aid to so many non-wealthy families.  And I suspect they would argue to really evaluate that, you need to look well beyond the bottom 20%.\n\nLike Harvard, for example, claims 20% of its students pay nothing, which apparently covers family incomes up to $85,000.  I think that likely covers closer to the bottom 50% of families with kids, ranked by household income.  Of course if the bottom 50% of families is only 20% of Harvard families, that is already a tell on what is happening at Harvard.\n\nGenerally, Harvard claims for 90 percent of American families, Harvard would cost less than a public university.  Notably that isn't same as saying that 90% of actual Harvard families are paying less, indeed apparently 45% of Harvard students are full pay.   But I think their point is the \"middle class\" families sending kids to Harvard--whatever percentage that might be--are doing relatively well compared to similar families sending their kids to public universities.\n\nSo, I think they would argue that sure, all this implies 45%+ of Harvard families are in the top 10% of families, probably a lot of them in the top 1% of families, perhaps a significant fraction higher still.\n\nHowever, they would then argue that those 45%+ help make Harvard more affordable than public universities for the other half(ish) of Harvard students.\n\nOf course one might respond they already have enough, that they could now just provide generous financial aid out of their existing endowments without so many full pay students and \"special situation\" admits and so on.  But I suspect they would respond that in order to both sustain their generous financial aid AND also make the sorts of ongoing capital and faculty investments they need to stay Harvard, they need to sustain these multi-generational relationships with wealthier families.\n\nIs all that totally convincing?  Well, I am not sure Harvard is following a policy that maximizes total social welfare.  But I do think one has to be cautious about assuming Harvard could radically change its admissions policies and still remain Harvard forever.\n\nIndeed, the fact is these \"top\" private colleges have long had this basic model--they are where the elites who have lots of social and economic capital mingle with the \"smart\" people who lack such capital (at least at that scale), hopefully to their mutual benefit.  And while this is not the only viable model of how a very good college can work, if you admire the \"rankings\" that Harvard and its like have achieved following this model (relative to, say, the Cal system, or other top public universities) . . . then you may have to accept the \"gross\" side of that model makes it possible for colleges with such \"rankings\" to exist.\n\nIn fact, WUSTL is a relative newcomer to the \"top colleges\" list, and its basic history is that starting in the late 1980s or so, a bunch of wealthy families led an effort to raise a bunch of funds for WUSTL, and massively increased WUSTL's endowment (to the point I believe it now has a top 10ish endowment).  WUSTL then used those resources to buy better research facilities, better dorms, better faculty, AND better students (meaning offer more generous financial aid to highly competitive admits).\n\nSo basically, WUSTL's \"ranking\" in the last couple decades as a \"T20\" university very much depended on exactly this sort of \"gross\" relationship.\n\nAnd again, I am not saying this is a story of perfect execution on a plan to increase social welfare.  But it is a good example of how there is a practical connection between the \"gross\" side of \"top\" private colleges and why they are considered \"top\" at all.",

But the optics are what they are: Colleges are giving the most privileged members of society yet an additional privilege above the rest of us. It's like a football game in which a legacy already starts the game with a 21-point lead but is spotted an additional field goal by the university. \n\nI also don't know how much the legacy issue contributes to alumni contributions to the endowment. Are Dartmouth grads really only giving Dartmouth money because they want Dartmouth to maintain the modest legacy-advantage for their children. My guess is that it's certainly a factor, but it may not be a huge one.  \n\nEven if legacy-consideration ultimately serves a utilitarian cause, I still think it's a bit gross. It's like Charles Kushner's $2.5mm donation to Harvard during Jared Kushner's senior year. That money may have paid for 30 poor kids to go to college or feed thousands of starving orphans, but it still feels icky and anti-egalitarian. Most of all, I appreciate the fact that a number of schools like MIT and CMU don't need to trade access for endowment. \n\nAs for WashU, [it was ranked in the low-20's to high teens through most of the 80's and 90's](https://publicuniversityhonors.com/2017/09/13/u-s-news-rankings-for-57-leading-universities-1983-2007/). It's now ranked 15. YMMV, but I still think fawning on the super privileged to climb half dozen spots in USNWR is a little . . . you guessed it . . . gross. \n\nI could be wrong, but my guess is that a lot of schools will phase out legacy consideration over the next few decades. \n\nAs for the idea that full-pay kids help subsidize the tuition of lower income kids, I've heard that too, and I understand it to a certain extent. Harvard is a somewhat positive example; WashU less so. WashU simply isn't subsidizing any meaningful portion of actual poor people (&lt;1%). And its financial aid seems, at best, average if not below average within the T20. WashU, however, is known for nice buildings, good food, and Tempur-Pedic mattresses.  It's hard to avoid the conclusion that it's a school for rich folk. Now, I don't personally feel any SJW outrage at WashU, and my torch and pitchfork will remain shelved. But it doesn't exactly endear me to WashU either.\n\nAnyhow, your post raises two other interrelated and too-complex-to-discuss-now issues: (1) Do elite colleges *need* to be as expensive as they are or have they become so because most of their wealthy student bodies can readily afford such price increases? (2) Just how corrosive have USNWR rankings and \"prestige\" been on higher education?",

I'll share my experience though it seems to make me feel like an outlier in this circumstance.\n\nI'm a lower income incoming graduate student matriculating into WashU this fall. My family makes around 60k a year, I had to take out a significant amount of loans as an undergrad with no scholarship then.  I went to a school 20 minutes from my house so I could commute to cut as many costs as I could.\n\nI was a good student, but quite shy of being remarkable, nearly failed out the first year because I partied too much. I only wanted to go to grad school for because I bounced back well enough in classes by the end of senior year to apply for a broad range of programs to see what would happen.\n\nFor all of the programs that I got into, most took into account that I was an inconsistent student and gave me little to no scholarship money, except for WashU. The amount of aid I am receiving from them is enough to make a school of that caliber financially feasible for me, rather than me fearing a crippling amount of debt as a necessity in order to get a quality education.\n\nI have been hearing many things like this after getting in, and it's jarring to realize that I might be one of a few lower-income bracket students at the school, uprooting myself from my family to leave home and. I'm only hoping that like with me, they're making the decisions that continue to provide funding for the students that absolutely need it to attend. They've certainly got a large enough endowment to do so.",

                            "comment": "So in the ongoing legacy discussion triggered by the Harvard admissions lawsuit and revelations contained in the discovery record, Harvard (and others) have at least claimed that legacy admissions does lead to higher giving.  It apparently is not just a prospective effect, but also that after the legacy admission, both the parents and the legacy admit are more likely to give larger sums, and that this continues on across multi-generation family relationships.\n\nAgain, you are perfectly entitled to feel \"gross\" about it, but I am pointing out that in order for these sorts of \"top\" colleges to be the \"top\" colleges, it appears this grossness was necessary.\n\nFor example, in another post, I illustrated how Harvard's revenue is much more dependent on wealthy families (philanthropy and net tuition) than MIT's, because MIT gets a much higher percentage of its revenues from research grants.\n\nAs to WUSTL, it likely started climbing before the beginning of the US News era.  We of course don't have easily comparable ratings from before that period, but if you look at older ratings of various sorts, it seems like WUSTL was much lower ranked as of the 1970s or so.  Like in the 1967 Gourman Report, WUSTL was only 37.   And there is actually a really good NYT article from 2003, \"Secret of one college's success is aid for academic achievers,\" about this very subject.\n\nFinally, you are right that \"actually poor people\" are not really the main beneficiaries of this system.  What these sorts of \"top\" private colleges are really trying to do is woo highly-qualified students throughout the non-upper-class.  A few of those students will be \"actually poor people,\" but many will just be from \"middle class\" families.  However, what they are trying to do, as Harvard explains, is make their costs for such families competitive with the top public universities, because those are the sorts of colleges those students would otherwise be choosing if not for financial aid.\n\nOK, so this definitely is not students from families in the top 1% subsidizing students from families in the bottom 20%.  It is more like students from families in the top 1% subsidizing students from families in the bottom 99% (there is some debate how this works out for the full pay people who are more like top 10% than top 1%, but I personally think once you realize the role philanthropy is playing in addition to tuition, those \"upper middle class\" families are getting subsidies too, just not as much as middle-middle-class families).\n\nTo just briefly address your final two questions:\n\n(1) Unfortunately, if you are mostly using colleges like Harvard or WUSTL to define the \"elite\" colleges, then other than the different sorts of \"elite\" colleges like MIT that get much more revenue from research grants, likely those colleges do need to keep spending on dorms and labs and famous faculty and activities and such to sustain their \"elite\" status over time;\n\n(2) although the way US News defines and reports \"elite\" colleges likely isn't helping, none of this just started happening when US News started this reporting.  As in, Harvard has been following this basic model since at least well before WWII.  Most of what we think of as the \"top\" private colleges, again with the partial exception of \"tech\" schools, consciously followed the same basic model as Harvard and its traditional competitors, because it proved to be a sustainable model for becoming and remaining a successful private college.  And all that was well-known long before US News came along to keep score.\n\nBut there have also long been alternative models for \"top\" colleges--public universities, the service academies, and so on.  US News can be somewhat blamed, I suppose, for the basic concept of putting colleges with such different models into one ranking (although US News has varied over time on those efforts).  But it has always been an option for people who find the socioeconomic \"elitism\" of the \"top\" private colleges \"gross\" to opt for those alternative models instead.\n\nAnd many have.\n\nAnd yet, Stanford still wins something like 88% of its cross-admit battles with Berkeley.  And Stanford is fundamentally able to do that because it is following the Harvard model, meaning the disproportionately high number of Stanford families who are top 1%-ish are subsidizing the disproportionately low number of Stanford families who are bottom 99%-ish.\n\nAnd so US News or not, as long as Stanford can win so many of its cross-admit battles with Berkeley that way, I doubt the Harvard/Stanford/etc. model is going to go away.",

These schools affiliate with the rich for one purpose: to grow their endowments.  Further, emphasizing feeder private schools, ECs that are accessible only to the wealthy (summer camps, \"research\" with well known professors) and150k$+ consultants with \"personal\" relationships, they don't need to identify the wealthy themselves.  The wealthy self-select into these programs because only they can afford them.  The result is that at Harvard, for example, as many students come from not the 1% but from the .1%, that is, 1 in a 1000, the truly wealthy, as the bottom 20%.  Thus per capita, **the ultra-wealthy are 200 times as likely to be represented in Harvard College's student body as the bottom 20%.**",

You are just getting less benefit than the reduced-pay students.\n\nHonestly, to the extent anyone is getting \"screwed,\" it would appear to be the families who give way more to these colleges than they ever get back in these terms.  But I suppose they have their own reasons for doing that (bragging rights, maybe some admittances they otherwise wouldn't get, and so on).  And it certainly is not my problem.",

I think we'd both speculate that nearly all 1%-ers go to college and that, I dunno, less than half of the bottom 20% do. Again, I'm more interested in the middle chunk representing the middle-class. That said, this matter less when comparing within the T20. Chicago accepts more than 5 times as many poor people as WashU, its midwestern counterpart.

                            "comment": "So from what I know about university funding, very likely a significant portion of that difference is explainable by research grants.\n\nTo illustrate this I am going to compare Harvard and MIT, which is pretty close to a naturally controlled comparison for these purposes.\n\nIn the modern private university system, the three main pillars of funding are philanthrophy (endowment income and gifts for current use), net tuition (so tuition net of financial aid), and research grants.\n\nHarvard reported that recently their operating revenue was respectively 45% philanthropy (36% endowment income, 9% gifts for current use), 21% net tuition, and 17% research grants.  The remaining 17% was \"other\" which includes things like publications, royalties, fees for services, and so on.\n\nMIT reports things a little differently, but it appears for them, philanthropy was 34% (24% endowment income, 10% gifts for current use), net tuition was 10%, and research grants were 40%.  Again 16% was various other things.\n\nOK, that is a pretty big difference in mix.  Basically there is like 22% which for Harvard is coming from wealthy people (philanthropy and net tuition), and MIT is coming from research instead.   And in fact, that marginal difference was right around half net tuition (+11%) and half philanthropy (+11% as well).\n\nIn turn, that is probably most of the answer to the question of why Harvard admits a much higher fraction of very wealthy students than MIT.  Harvard is doing that because both immediately in terms of net tuition, and in the long term in terms of philanthropy, Harvard needs to get a lot more revenue in those ways than MIT.",

In the end, it has the faculty, the research facilities, and the student facilities it actually has.  Those then attract the very competitive students that it actually gets.  And soon enough, all that gets reflected in perceptions of WUSTL being a \"top\" college, because all that is what defines a \"top\" college.\n\nAnd sure, some people who remember older college rankings will grumble how back in their day, WUSTL was not considered a \"top\" college.  And some people (actually most people) will have no idea about more than a tiny handful of schools, and what they do think they know will mostly be wrong.\n\nBut for the most part, those people are not the sort of people who will matter to college graduates.  For the most part, the people who will matter are paid to stay current on what is happening among colleges.  And to them, WUSTL being a relative newcomer to this game will largely be just an interesting historical observation, not something that will adversely affect an otherwise highly competitive WUSTL graduate.",

This data no longer represents WashU\u2019s finaid or their student body. As I mentioned, WashU\u2019s class of 2026 had 20% low income and 16% first gen which is on par with schools like Duke, Dartmouth, Vanderbilt, JHU, UVA, and Rice. I also wasn\u2019t referring to wealth here. I was strictly referring to our employment statistics, which extends to our med, law, and grad school placements, all of which are competitive with the other T20s. Truthfully, having a rich mommy or daddy can help you land a nice job, but let\u2019s be honest here. This ain\u2019t the case for most kids, especially a 272,000k average family income doesn\u2019t imply that these families are all high up managers or recruiters that decide who gets hired and who doesn\u2019t.",

The only reason you would say it isn\u2019t on the same level is because of its location. Also literally every major uni has wealthy donors that greatly contributed to it being a nationally ranked school. Literally Rutgers was founded 2 years after Brown yet is no where near as prestigious.",

Compare the salaries of recent graduates. Location? St. Louis is a major US city and commercial hub. Cornell is in Bumfuck Ithaca -- a 4 hour drive from NYC -- and Brown is in Providence, Rhode Island. Neither is considered primo destinations for anyone.",

This is completely outdated and is not at all representative of WashU\u2019s student population. WashU has put in A LOT of time, energy, and money into making their finaid as generous as physically possible. They\u2019ve increased their percentage of low-income and first-gen students and the numbers are now very similar other historically less richer-people schools. They have scholarship programs for kids that live in rural and low-income areas where they help these young (middle and high school) students financially and academically and give them full rides to the school afterwards. This article is old. It doesn\u2019t show the present or the future.",

If WashU has gotten a lot better, great. I'm not rooting against them. And more recent data is better data. But, in the absence of such data, this is the best I've got. And it's not that old.",

Rather than responding to those comments separately, I'll do so here.\n\nI think it's totally fair to challenge the datedness of the study. But I personally don't think a decade is exactly old history. Is there a good source for updated data? One that consolidates the economic diversity of such schools? I'm not going to comb through piles of common data sets and do public records requests for each school. I'd much prefer that a reputable outlet like the NYT do that work. Anyhow, I'd love to see an updated ranking. Indeed, as mentioned before, I'd like to see a more fulsome ranking that takes middle-class demographics more into consideration. (I sometimes suspect that the economic profiles of certain schools may look like a barbells with lots of rich kids at the top, a decent number of poor kids at the bottom, but few middle-class kids in the middle.)\n\nAnd, regardless, I think the study reveals important aspects of certain universities' underlying ethos. Is it *possible* that these schools have totally changed their ethos in the last decade? Maybe. Is it likely? Probably not. But, to be clear, I'm not rooting against it. I hope WashU has made dramatic improvements. It certainly appears it's made some improvement. I'm also skeptical that the rankings above would be much different today, although I think the WashU's and Vandys would probably look a little better.",

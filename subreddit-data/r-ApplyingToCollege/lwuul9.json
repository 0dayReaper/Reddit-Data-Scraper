I've had a student get into Grinnell writing the first paragraph of her personal statement in Elvish. Another got into Colby writing about tea. I got into Grinnell using two unedited journal entries as essays.\n\nIt's all about execution--do these seemingly random topics shed light on who you are as a person? As a scholar? As a friend? If so, virtually anything can work!",

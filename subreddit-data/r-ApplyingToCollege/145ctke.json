    "postText": "I took 2 finals today and I think I failed them because the scores are not posted yet,but my teachers posted the final grades.. one of them was 92 and went to 88.1, and the other one went 87 from 89.8.\n\nI'm so dissapointed that I failed my finals because I studied so hard for these finals.. and I so concernedd that TWO of my grades went down.. If I email my teacher for an extra credit or any other chance that I can recover my grade, would they get mad or annoyed?? I'm so sad",

            "comment": "Super sorry this happened. It can't hurt to ask or at least find out where you went wrong, see if you can argue partial credit on certain questions to get some points back. But also be prepared that the answer is likely to be a straight up \"no\". But also don't spin out over a couple of high Bs.  It's disappointing, yes, but hardly the end of the world. You'll still be in the running for good colleges and this will end up being a very minor blip in the scheme of things.",

If this is something that happens often at your school (teachers allowing extra credit work to improve grades), then maybe they will allow you to do something. But generally teachers aren't in favor of doing this, since it gives an opportunity to some students that others did not have.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am a homeschooler from Maryland, and in the future I want to pursue a career in Neglected Tropical Medicine, with a vector biology specialty.\n\nI am trying to decide how exactly I should go about achieving this goal, as it has a lot of academic prerequisites, generally speaking.\n\nI could go 1 of roughly 4 ways. I am planning on getting some kind of IR or public policy degree, with a double major in either Public/Global Health, Entomology, General Biology, or (basically just Tulane, Colorado state, and maybe a couple others) Vector Biology/Tropical medicine. I\u2019m unsure if I should apply to them because they may be too far away from home in MD. \n\nThis is for undergrad majors specifically.\n\nThis is a very niche field, and while a lot of that is because of interest I\u2019m sure, I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s the ONLY factor. Does nobody remember being amazed as a child, hearing \u201cThe deadliest animal in the world is actually the mosquito!\u201d? I\u2019m wondering if that the almost void for vector biology here in the states could maybe be a result of lack of qualification? Not many students will be taking courses in this in my experience, as I find it fascinating, but no one else does, hence, lack of coursework.\n\nEverything is almost always at the Ph.D, and masters level at a minimum.\n\nI guess one could call it a more advanced field? Maybe that\u2019s the reason for a lack of coursework?\n\n\nRegardless, I want to make sure I am prepared, and have access to connections which will foster this. I\u2019m unsure what major, and where, will provide me with the best opportunities to succeed.",

            "comment": "My advice is to not worry too much about specialization at the undergraduate level. Double majoring with a policy/public health degree and a life sciences degree isn\u2019t impossible, so that\u2019s a fine goal. But you do absolutely need the life sciences degree. I would recommend either general biology or ecology and evolutionary biology. An IR/public health double major absolutely will not cut it.",

For the kind of work you want to do, you\u2019ll benefit from taking biochemistry/cell biology/immunology and other \u201chard\u201d bio courses, but you\u2019ll also want to take courses in ecology and infectious disease (because that\u2019s where you\u2019ll learn about disease modeling).",

            "comment": "I'm currently on this endeavor to create a database of unique and/or rare majors. So a good approach for you may be to look at a bunch of schools to see what they offer to see how specific they can really get into your field of interest. For example, I just came across a \"Health, Disease, and Culture\" minor that George Mason University offers. \n\nEven with \"just biology\" it's important to see what facets of biology that school is passionate about/emphasizes. For example, some schools don't care a lot about plant bio/ecology, others care less about biochemistry, so it's important to see what the faculty and courseload in the biology department prioritizes. But like u/chumer_ranion said, you're going to find that the upper biology electives are going to usually have a variety of classes, which could include vector bio-adjacent topics. Usually the courses that schools teach will be posted online. IF that school has 1 or 2 professors passionate about vector bio and/or tropical diseases, that school is going to have a lot more upper bio electives taught in that topic.  \n\nSo, it's really just research, research, research to find the places that'll support your niche interests.",

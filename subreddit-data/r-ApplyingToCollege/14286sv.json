            "comment": "Because law is a postgraduate field in the U.S., and dedicated \"pre-law\" studies at the undergraduate level are not very highly regarded by the top law schools, nor indeed even offered by many colleges that place their graduates at the top law schools, generally speaking you might find it hard to combine high-level economics study and \"pre-law\" study in the United States.\n\nThe more common alternative for U.S. students thinking of attending law school would be to combine economics (which is considered one of the \"good\" majors for law school admissions, although really a long list will work) with some of the other \"good\" subjects, like philosophy (particularly with an ethics focus), political science, or so on.\n\nIndeed, just as an example, Yale's Ethics, Politics, and Economics major (EP&amp;E) is sort of a model of the kind of interdisciplinary major that is considered ideal for, among other things, students interested in law school.  This is far from its only purpose, but the sort of broad introduction to social science and philosophical concepts you would get in a major like that would be good background preparation for law school.  Anecdotal, but I know a person who majored in EP&amp;E at Yale who not only went on to a top law school, but eventually became Dean of a law school himself.\n\nI'll just conclude with the following statement from the American Bar Association (the U.S.'s top professional organization for practicing lawyers) on this subject, which I would really hope anyone interested in law school would take to heart when thinking about college majors:\n\n\"The ABA does not recommend any undergraduate majors or group of courses to prepare for a legal education. Students are admitted to law school from almost every academic discipline. You may choose to major in subjects that are considered to be traditional preparation for law school, such as history, English, philosophy, political science, economics or business, or you may focus your undergraduate studies in areas as diverse as art, music, science and mathematics, computer science, engineering, nursing or education. Whatever major you select, you are encouraged to pursue an area of study that interests and challenges you, while taking advantage of opportunities to develop your research and writing skills. Taking a broad range of difficult courses from demanding instructors is excellent preparation for legal education. A sound legal education will build upon and further refine the skills, values, and knowledge that you already possess.\"",

Only looking at brown.\n\nIntended major: Psychology (want to become a therapist or social worker, anything that is helping ppl)\n\nClarification about major - I\u2019m not looking for the best of the best psych program, I am looking for a school where I\u2019ll get a good education but I am more focused on finding a school where I belong and have positive social experience and fulfilling time.\n\nFinancial situation- grateful to be able to afford most colleges\n\nProjected gpa - 3.8 ish?\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much!",

AU is more of a suburb, if you want a traditional campus, and Georgetown is also a more traditional campus is a quiet part of the city. \n\nAll three are pretty racially diverse, psych is a super popular major at GW (and I believe the other two as well), and all three (and DC as a whole) are very lgbt friendly",

You will probably want to eliminate some of these because they're too small (enrollment &gt;= 3000 but &lt; 4000), because they're too big (enrollment &gt; 30k), because they're not sufficiently diverse, or because they have a religious focus.

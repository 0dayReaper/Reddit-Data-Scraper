    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a rising senior and (depending on who you ask) a first-gen student. My mom went to college in India, and my dad took some community college courses in the US, but neither of them went through the process of American college admissions. My sister was accepted to UT Austin in 2018, so that\u2019s really their only experience. I\u2019ve come to realize that my parents\u2026 are really misinformed. Like, really. My mom made me take both the ACT and the SAT (I\u2019m a CA resident) and when I explained to her that UCs and CSUs are test blind, she insisted that they secretly look at your scores anyways, and that they\u2019re just saying that \u201cnot to look racist\u201d. Another thing is that she insists you need \u201cat least 20\u201d extracurriculars to have a shot at any UCs (even though 20 is the maximum you can even list). She also has a super warped view of what a \u201cgood\u201d college is. She has her heart set on me going to Calpoly SLO (even though they have a relatively unremarkable program for the subject I want to major in), and whenever I bring up schools I\u2019m interested in (CSU Long Beach, SDSU, UCSD) she tells me they\u2019re \u201cbasically community colleges\u201d and that she refuses to send me there. She goes on and on with her misconceptions, usually ending in her saying some rude things to me (telling me I have a shit GPA, telling me I won\u2019t get into college, etc.) and she\u2019s starting to freak me out. How do I talk sense to her?",

For top business schools, admissions are based on your rank after national competitive exams + one interview (sometimes also oral exams). Also to enter residency after 6 years of medical school, your specialty and location are decided based on your results at national competitive exams without any interview or ECs / research consideration. So yes a of countries still based on scores and grades.",

            "comment": "Oh boy!\n\nAs someone who has worked with quite a lot of parents in the past, and still do now, I can feel this in my soul. I worked with a large Chinese and Korean population; so, the college admissions conspiracies typically came from WeChat posts spreading random bs that was meant to fearmonger people. \n\nHere's a general tip. \n\nIt's NOT going to matter how right you are. It DOESN'T matter how many facts, statistics, Common Data Sets, interviews with AOs, etc, that you show her. As long as you're contradicting her original beliefs, she's not going to budge. \n\nThe best thing you can do is to recognize you can't force her to CHANGE her mind. But, you can help guide her to a certain degree toward critical thinking. This is different from making her \"see the light.\" **Instead, you're helping her stop thinking ideologically and getting her to wrestle with new information. Often, this is done not by telling her stuff but by asking her questions.** \n\nOkay, here's an example. (Note: this is not going to play out exactly as I listed; but, it's an example)\n\nYou: I'm not planning on stuffing my resume with 20 \"fluff\" extracurriculars. \n\nMom: You shouldn't do that. The UCs only accept students who have filled out all 20 of the EC slots.  \n\nYou: Can you explain to me a little bit about that thought process? I'm just trying to understand where you're coming from.\n\nMom: The UCs only accept students with 20 ECs; all the other students are rejected. I heard about this from your friend's mom and her friends too.\n\nYou: I need this to be clear. I want to make sure I'm following the best practices for applying; but, your advice is conflicting with a lot of what experts and AOs are saying. What do you think of this?\n\nMore often than not, \"reflecting\" by just asking questions is going to get parents to start thinking critically about **WHY** they believe what they believe. Now, sometimes what happens is parents will just flip the table when they're questioned and say... \n\n\"Okay, okay fine. You can apply however way you want. Do whatever you want. I don't care anymore. I birthed you so you should've listened to what I say. I'm older. I fought a tiger to get to school back when I was your age. etc. etc.\"\n\nBut, this is just a way to avoid the responsibility of wrestling with stats and facts. Parents often don't want to actually think through these facts. But, it's important that you insist on asking them what they mean by this to understand better. \n\nI don't know if I worded this properly, so apologies if this is confusing at all. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions, though! Best of luck!",

Blame your counselor if you can. When you get in, take a stand. It'll be tough and confrontational, but you'll have to do it. You might have to adapt some unsavory rhetoric from them, i.e flaming the students at the schools you don't like \"they have lower average sat literally trash at schools only xyz majors go there\". \n\nGood luck.",

Challenging preconceived views is always difficult, but when they see you as an authority then they put you higher up on the hierarchy and tend to give in. \n\nThere are still like 8% of these parents who will not listen to anyone else for any reason, even when they pay for a person to help them.

Like when daughter randomly won a spelling bee in middle school, suddenly parents I barely knew were asking me for advice about academic things. I wonder if there are parents of kids who have gotten into good colleges (or Cal Poly specifically?), whose advice might seem more valuable because they are also in the parent role. Maybe there would be a way to create a situation where they talk to parents of successful kids who didn\u2019t take the SAT or list 20 extracurriculars. By the way, I think my daughter did fill out all the EC lines but she did it by breaking things up into different categories to make it come out to whatever the number was. She mostly did theater, but she included unofficial activities and separated things that could have been combined. She didn\u2019t lie, but she sliced and diced her stuff so it came out to the right number. This let her make the activities sound more interesting bc she had more space for detail. I have no idea whether it actually made any difference in her applications, but it might be a way to appease your mom without actually doing more activities.",

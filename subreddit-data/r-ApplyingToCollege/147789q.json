    "postText": "I am a rising junior. My schedule is pretty rigorous for junior year . I plan on taking core class AP\u2019s like Lang, APUSH, etc. I have a couple of science AP\u2019s + AP CSA ( hoping for computer science major). I have my schedule planned for senior year as well\u2026but, the problem is that my freshman-sophomore year schedule was not that rigorous due to scheduling conflicts via moving schools the summer going into  my sophomore year. Plus, I was not eligible for the AP classes in my freshman year. So my question is, will starting late  affect  the rigor score in admissions to these top schools? Or do they just care that you\u2019re challenging yourself?.\n\n**Helpful information:**\n\n**School 1 (grade 9 schedule):**\n\nHonors: Biology\n\nAP\u2019s: none\n\nrest are regular classes\n\n\n\n**School 2(10th grade):**\n\nHonors: World History, 9th grade ELA\n\nAP\u2019s: none\n\nrest are regular classes\n\n\n**Junior year(planned schedule):**\n\nAPs: APUSH, APLANG, AP pre calc, AP CHEM, AP PHYSICS 1, AP CSA\n\nHonors: none\n\nBasically all AP accept for Game design and Spanish 2 \n\n\n**Senior year(planned schedule):**\n\nAPs: \n\nAPLIT\n\nAP calc BC \n\nAP BIO \n\nAPMACRO(1 semester)\n\nAP GOV( 1 semester)\n\nAP euro \n\n[Some other rigorous + interesting AP please leave recommendations - I want rigor + enjoyability]\n\nThe only regular class is going to be Spanish 3 (there are no honors FL at my school)\n\n\n**Here are the AP\u2019s offered at the school I attended in   9th grade:**\n\nAPHUG and APES\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP classes offered at my current school(**23**):\n\n**ELA:**\n\nAP lang\n\nAp LIT\n\n**Math:**\n\n*Both* AP calcs\n\nAP pre calc ( next year)\n\nAP stats\n\n**Science:**\n\nAP bio \n\nAP chem\n\nAP environmental \n\nAP physics 1( my school **doesn\u2019t** offer 2 or C\u2019s)\n\n**Social studies/ History:**\n \nAPHUG\n\nAPWH\n\nAPUSH\n\nAPMAC\n\nAPGOV\n\nAP EURO\n\nAP PSYCH\n\n**Fine Arts:**\n\nAP art history \n\nAP studio art 2D/3D\n\nAP music theory \n\n**Languages:**\n\nAp Spanish \n\n**CTE:**\nAP CSP\n\nAP CSA\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n**Questions/comments/ notes:**\n\nI will have taken **14/23** APs offered\n\nI am trying to only take rigorous AP\u2019s offered( I.E no APES)\n\nWhat should my final AP for senior year be?\n\n\nShould I see if I can dual enroll at a college for a higher level physics class or programming class senior year?\n\nTHANKS FOR READING :)",

Participate in new activities and do online ones if you have to. \n\nFrom my personal experience this year, I know that AOs don't look at applicants that mention their poverty (me) or medical conditions (me) or trauma as heroes, but rather as broken kids and they fear admitting them actually. I got 21 rejections RD. I then removed all these past unrelevant weaknesses, made some changes to my app and applied to 1 more school. I got accepted with 20k merit scholarship. I believe if I was still a broken kid, I wouldn't have gotten in.",

            "comment": "Me too, this year(I'm a junior in high school) I decided to be honest in my English class, so I looked at my assignments the way I see my family discussions about the most random things. It's quite fun first we start off by making fun of people and laughing our asses off about it, and then the conversations get deep, and we talk about why people act a certain way or do certain things. And obviously as a teenager we tend to get attached to shows or celebrities(for me it's BTS and My Hero Academia) and with that I decided to add what learned from them to my work. My writing style in that class changed because I wanted my teacher to hear out what I really had to say and what I've learned the past few years. I made a risky move and literally told my teacher about my ego issues and how I see people vs the way they might see me. I come off as a genuine and really dynamic person, and that's what I want to be, but deep down I feel like I unintentionally look down on others or feel jealous if there're better than me. But anyways I got lucky and it turns out my teacher is pretty dope. He even wrote an email to my parents about how I think outside the box and stuff like that. I want him to write a letter of rec for me because him and my sophomore history teacher(she was also pretty cool) were the only teachers I ever had a good relationship with. I'm not good at talking to adults, probably because my vocabulary mainly consists of curse words (#\uff40-\\_\u309d-) But yea over all these essays had a positive affect on me, so far.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a rising senior currently getting into the college admissions process. I am worried because although I believe all other aspects of my applicaiton are quite strong (perfect GPA, 1580 SAT, research, strong ECs, etc), I lack awards as my school does not bestow many and I was passed over on the book awards. Will this tank me, and alternatively, are there any awards I can self apply for? Thank you so much, and please DM me if you want additional information on my overall application. ",

I am not super active in math club, but I do my own mathematical research (I don't have the help of a professor or Phd) outside of school.",

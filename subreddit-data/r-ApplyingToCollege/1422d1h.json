    "postText": "I just went through the estimated cost calculator (the college board one), and it said that tuition would be around 80k but after financial aid and scholarships it would be 65k. I was wondering how accurate this is especially if your planning on applying early decision. \n\nThanks for the help!",

Everyone\u2019s who\u2019s done that Ik has gotten the right amount. Another thing with ED is if you don\u2019t get enough financial aid, you can just back out. It\u2019s easier than people think, I know multiple people who\u2019ve done it- you just tell them",

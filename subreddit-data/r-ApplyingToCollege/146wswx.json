    "postText": "hey everyone, im an international student from india. i am looking to apply to colleges in the us(w financial aid). currently im in 12th, my avg gpa of grade 9,10 and 11 is 90.35/100. i want to study computer science not just because its popular, but because i really have an interest in that particular field. i don't have many extra curricular activities that shows my interest in cs. the lack of extracurricular activities is because i am also preparing for jee(indian national exam). i want to stand out to colleges. internet posts says that i should build projects, i would live to too, but i dont have that much time. i can't just give up on jee as there is no guarantee that i would get into an us college. \nim stuck in this situation. i will apply to colleges this year.\nI REALLY NEED YOUR ADVICE. PLEASE HELP ME OUT. GIVE ME SOME IDEAS ABOOUT WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW......",

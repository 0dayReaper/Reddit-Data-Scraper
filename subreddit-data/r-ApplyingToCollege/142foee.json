    "postText": "\nHey, I am an international student from Iraq and I am curious to know if my grades meet the requirements for universities in the United States and Canada. Furthermore, I would greatly appreciate your guidance regarding the choice of a suitable major. Currently, I am enrolled in an American curriculum school where I have attained a GPA of 3.2. I am feeling quite anxious about my grades as I am entering my senior year in the upcoming academic term. Throughout my high school journey, I have actively participated in my school's debate team for a period of two years. Additionally, I had the privilege of being a member of the school theatre team last year, alongside serving as an editor for our school magazine. Moreover, I had the honor of organizing chess tournaments at my school. Looking ahead, I have made plans to undertake four AP courses next year, specifically in the subjects of Chemistry, Calculus, Biology, and History. Due to the limited offerings at my school, I will be pursuing the History course through online classes and self-study. As of now, I have yet to take the SAT exam.",

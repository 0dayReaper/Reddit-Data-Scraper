It was a genuine interest, but I was a late bloomer and I wasn't interested in grad school. I wasn't in any sort of pre-professional track. I thought about dropping out, but my parents knew I would never go back if I quit, so I stuck it out.\n\nI later found my \"passion\", went back to school at a UC and found a career I was genuinely interested in. This didn't happen until I was in my 30s - something that a lot of people don't have the luxury of doing.\n\nWhen I talk to parents of recent Stanford grads, they lament that the undergrad culture is primarily CS and tech bros - definitely changing the feel of the school.\n\nHonestly, it's tough to know what you want to to do when you're 18 and fresh out of HS. I understand the pressure to focus on high-paying gigs and the goal of being \"successful\".",

            "comment": "High finance/top consulting is probably the biggest difference in opportunities between the top tier schools and \u201cregular\u201d schools.  \n   \nMBB consulting pays a good amount: ~120-130k total comp starting with pretty structured ppromotion systems/pay raises, and basically is a super strong name on your resume in the business world.   \n   \nInvestment banking is among the highest options that you can get paid out of college (~200k average first year total comp at the top banks) and if you\u2019re a workaholic, it\u2019s probably the simplest way to a 7 figure salary, either through staying on the buy side or exiting to sell side firms which are usually very very hard to get into without investment banking experience or similar.   \n   \nNone of these are necessarily unattainable from non-top schools, but your odds are just greatly reduced. I went to a top 10 public school and on a solid year, we had 1 person go into MBB or a top investment bank. Some data that was collected [here](https://www.peakframeworks.com/post/consulting-target-schools) shows that Harvard sends around 30-40 to MBB per year, which is approximately 300x the per capita rate of my top 10 university.   \n   \nBasically, top schools are feeders to these high paying jobs the way that feeder high schools are feeders to high ranking universities. If you don\u2019t care about getting into these exclusive jobs, then going to a top university is not necessarily a big deal.",

The difference isn\u2019t as big on the finance side, with GS/MS/JPM taking 57 and the 4th and 5th largest being Citi and Bank of America, both at 13.   \n   \nThis suggests that most people who want to go into consulting at Wharton land MBB, since there\u2019s a distinct lack of tier 2 consulting firms that would still be great outcomes. Same for banking to a lesser extent, but also the list doesn\u2019t include the smaller boutique banks that are similarly elite as the 3 mentioned and just take less people each.",

I loved my classes, had several enthusiastic mentors in my major, won an award for original research, and won a national scholarship that paid a very significant chunk of my T10 law school tuition.  I also happened to adore my college town, greatly enjoyed watching our perennial March Madness basketball team, and made terrific friends (one of whom is now a federal judge, while another owns his own economic consulting firm after receiving his JD/PhD from Stanford).  \n\nMy spouse likewise enjoyed his undergraduate ivy and went on to a T10 law school.  But we met at onboarding, having started our careers at the same well-regarded big law firm.  And while his friends are great, they are simply lawyers, academics, consultants, and economists who work alongside colleagues who come from state flagships and LACs.

As I'm on full financial aid, the summer abroad grant is quite large. If I had attend my cities public university, my scholarships would have enabled me to attend at low or no cost, but I wouldn't have the freedom or funding to be able to pursue either of those opportunities. There's often times simply more money to be given out to programs aimed at lower income students.\n\nThe other big difference is the general economic security of the university. My local uni has faced huge cuts based on actions and policies taken by our govener, and the whole system has been in a really rough spot, with many programs being shrunk or completely  cut. Yale doesn't really have to worry about the politics in CT nearly as much because it's getting as much of its funding from it.",

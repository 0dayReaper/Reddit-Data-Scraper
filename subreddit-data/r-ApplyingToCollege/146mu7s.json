It\u2019s known for having a super strong biology and pre-med program, with resources from one of the top med schools in the country. It\u2019s in the city of St. Louis, and the campus feel is similar to Northwestern. WashU also has a popular major called Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP for short) that you might be interested in.",

Definitely give a shot to a few of them, and maybe Case Western Reserve, but think seriously about some of the public universities in the Great Lakes region, or maybe Rutgers or UConn just outside the Great Lakes region.  The campuses at Rutgers and UConn are not very nice, but they are good universities.",

Your essay should help a lot -- biology faculty really don't like teaching pre-meds all the time, and want some students around who actually want to be biologists.  It sounds like you have a clear path to telling that story.\n\nHonestly, the problem is just that your academics are in the very good, but not great category.  Improving the academics as much as you can in the next 6 months should be your goal.",

    "postText": "hi, current junior applying to college this fall. i only have four schools so far and really don\u2019t know what to add.\n\nstats r 95 uw, 100 w, 1400 sat (retaking in august). intended major is astronomy/astrophysics. pretty mid ecs (2 clubs + deca states, tutoring, volunteering, gwc, and a finance internship for a political campaign). i\u2019m an nj black female. size doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nmy current list is barnard, columbia, rutgers, and wellesley. my only preference is that i want schools in the northeast\n\nadditional question. do u guys think i need more safeties? i had a few more but removed them from my list because i would definitely choose rutgers over any of my other safeties. with my stats and the fact that i\u2019m in-state, i\u2019m pretty confident that i will get into rutgers so applying to safeties feels like a waste of money and time.",

            "comment": "You probably don't need it, but I really like having either an assured admission option or a rolling admission one where you get in early enough to know you're in somewhere. It can be a real stress relief.\n\nMaybe somewhere like Pitt would work for that, or TCNJ or Rollins if you want to make sure it's affordable?\n\nFor more targets and reaches I would look at some more LACs and mid size universities given your comment that you really prefer humanities to STEM - they often make it easier to do interdisciplinary studies and double majors and things like that.  Haverford, Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, Tufts, Smith, Vassar, etc. are all good ones to consider in that part of the country.",

Some other STEM degrees that maayyy be more interesting that you could get away with would be econ (or business if your parents are okay with that), psychology + sociology double major, global health, or neuroscience. \n\nBut what's neat is with those human-based STEM majors, especially, it's really easy to take courses that could double count toward like an anthropology double major or history.",

Figure out your major first, then think about your list. Have a lot more safeties that you actually like.

    "postText": "I took the June 3rd DSAT and it went disastrously.  \nThe EBRW section went well, but it all went downhill during math. I get spontaneous and intense nosebleeds when I'm stressed, sad, angry, etc, and math is a bit difficult for me. I'm also at my lowest point emotionally at the moment and all of that converged when I had 20 minutes left on the 2nd math module and my nose started bleeding.   \nI clicked on the unscheduled break option and ran to the bathroom but I couldn't come back to my laptop until like 5 mins were left on the module and at that point i just started guessing answers. no shot i get anything over a 1100 now.  \n\n\nFor most colleges I can pick and choose what scores to send but one of my top choices right now is Georgetown, which asks for all of them. Since I know I'll score terribly on this, should I cancel my score? I already scheduled my retake in August.",

Then yes if Georgetown is on your list then cancel.\n\nBut if you are unable to cancel don\u2019t stress - the is an additional information section in the application and you can use that to say that you were sick during that particular exam and your score is a reflection of not completing some sections.",

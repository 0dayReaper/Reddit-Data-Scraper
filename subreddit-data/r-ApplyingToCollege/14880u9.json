    "postText": "As many of you are aware, r/ApplyingToCollege has taken a stance against Reddit's decisions regarding API, as discussed in [an announcement made last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/142zezm/a2c_will_be_going_dark_on_june_12th_in_support_of/). We maintain that Reddit's changes not only make it harder for us as moderators, as we use third party apps that would be effected by these changes to moderate, but many of you who use them\u2014for better features, more support, and greater accessibility.\n\nWe initially chose to *privatize* our subreddit, but we've decided to take a more user-conscious approach. Instead, we will have the subreddit public but *restricted.* Additionally, instead of ending our protest on the fifteenth, we will be continuing **indefinitely**.\n\n# Fill me in, again: what is happening right now!?\n\n[Thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) of subreddits have joined together to protest against Reddit's policy changes, which you can read more about on r/Save3rdPartyApps. These changes make it harder for mods to moderate, cost third party apps millions of dollars annually to run, and make the Reddit experience inaccessible and inconvenient for the thousands that use them.\n\nIn the past \\~24 hours, server blackouts have broken the Reddit website. We hope that by continuing to apply pressure, Reddit will reverse these changes.\n\n# What's happening in A2C now?\n\nHere on out, **all posts will be visible.** *However*, no new posts can be made and comments will be disabled or otherwise suppressed. You may still be able to create comments but they will not be visible to other users. We are doing this for two reasons:\n\n1. **Accessibility**. A2C is full of resources\u2014including our wiki, past AMAs, and threads. Now, these should all be visible to you all as you prepare for essays and summer events.\n2. **Awareness.** Many of you are unaware of these protests and the decision to move to privatization. Mobile users also were unable to see our message with information on the protest, a link to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/a2c), and a means of contacting Mod Mail. Now that we're public but restricted all of you will be able to see what's happening.\n\n# What do I do if I want answers to my questions?\n\nOne of the best ways to support us in this protest is to get off of Reddit and use alternatives, including joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/a2c), what almost 30,000 of you already use. Within it are many channels to ask college questions to your heart's content. Additionally, our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/wiki/index/) is full of resources that can help you with every part of the application.\n\n# How can I help save third party apps?\n\n* **Use alternatives:** Like so many of you have, joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/a2c) is a great way to help not only us, but also yourselves as you apply to college.\n* **Complain:** Message the mods of [r/reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/), who are the admins of the site: message [/u/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/reddit/): submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/), such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Reddit bad\n* Boycott and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/a2c) to get answers to your college related questions\n* No one can comment or post. Only view existing posts.\n* This is **indefinite**. We will reverse these changes eventually, hopefully once Reddit fixes their wrongdoings.\n\n# LEARN MORE\n\n*growing list.*\n\n* r/Save3rdPartyApps: [Explanation of demands and why this matters](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/1476ioa/reddit_blackout_2023_save_3rd_party_apps/).\n* r/Save3rdPartyApps: [History of the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/147cksa/why_the_blackouts_happening_from_the_beginning/).",

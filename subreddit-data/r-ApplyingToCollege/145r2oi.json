    "postText": "While doing my IB (high school diploma) I got rocked really really hard by depression (better now since I have meds), causing my predicted grade to go really low, and missing a lot of application deadlines in the UK because I was too depressed to bring myself to think about the future.\n\nCurrently I am awaiting exam results, but I don\u2019t want to study in my home country, which I applied to most universities here. I want to go to the UK but there isn\u2019t a real way for me to get into a university in the UK. I was hoping there would be some sort of gap year programme, sort of like a pre university programme for me to apply to? I\u2019d like to get a head start on learning about the subject I want to major in. I\u2019m not sure if I want to spend a gap year doing nothing in academics. \n\nAny advice or pointers would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm a rising senior with a strong interest in investment banking and I'm hoping to connect with professionals in the field who can give me some insight into their day-to-day experiences. I've done my research and I understand that investment banking can involve long hours, but I believe the potential career opportunities make it all worthwhile.\n\nHere's the thing: my parents are not on board with my career choice. They would prefer me to pursue computer science or engineering, even though I've tried STEM camps and it just didn't click for me. My ultimate goal is to work in private equity, and I see investment banking as a great starting point.\n\nSo, I would really appreciate it if any investment bankers out there could share their experiences with me. What does a typical day in your life look like? Are the long hours as daunting as they seem? Is the career progression worth it? I'm also curious about the transferable skills that can be gained in investment banking.\n\nIf there are any investment bankers or finance majors who would like to chime in and offer some advice, I would be extremely grateful. Your insights will help me make an informed decision about my future career and navigate the challenges that come with it.\n\nThanks a bunch!",

Call it a long list of \"gold stars\".\n\nLooking ahead, they see getting a lucrative IB placement as the goldiest star available for a newly-minted college grad.  So, of course they imagine wanting that gold star.\n\nNow, happiness researchers will tell you that money has a sharply diminishing marginal return, meaning while up to a certain level more financial resources makes families happier (more or less up to what you might call a comfortable, secure, middle-class lifestyle), and in fact healthier.  But once your family gets to that level, more money in addition does very little to increase family happiness/health.\n\nAnd conversely, things like really long, high-stress work hours are generally adverse to both personal happiness/health, and indeed family happiness/health.\n\nBut this is suggesting that at some point, pursuing the next goldiest star might not actually be the path to the best life!  That indeed part of being a happy, healthy, fulfilled person is learning to identify when you have enough--enough money, enough prestige, enough of whatever makes stars the goldiest--such that you can focus more and more time and energy on things like health, family, community, and so on.\n\nAnd these kids are maybe not ready for such a message.  Hopefully someday, though.  Because I know enough people who didn't figure it out until late, if ever.  And those are typically not happy stories in the end.",

Including because there is always someone with more.\n\nSome people then try to fix this problem by earning more.  And that doesn't work either, but maybe if they earn more still . . . .\n\nOther people instead eventually figure out an answer to that type of question (what is better than earning north of whatever) that actually works for them, and then they have a shot at happiness.\n\nBut again, for now . . . you don't need to know your answer to that question.

The money is nice, but it means you don't have a personal life.\n\nThe hours are long is an understatement, I know someone at Lazard who was up at 3AM every morning, and typically didn't get home until 11PM, rarely earlier. The hours are hell. This isn't the xase for everyone, but this was the case for him, top student from Penn. It's also worth noting that sometimes you'll have work schedules like that, and some weeks it will be 8-5. Covid made it a little more flexible too. \n\nLuckily for you, you don't need to decide now. Companies hire investment bankers with history, art, and similar degrees. It's a question of your thinking, not as much your education, if that makes sense. You can do Mech E, and get an IB job with that degree.\n\nConnect on LinkedIn now, and try to talk to people. That's going to be your most accurate information. \n\nThe main takeaway is, if money is your only goal, IB is great. If you want to get married, have kids, etc. You won't be able to be present in their live until you have been an IB for 10+ years, or you move to a different field. Worth considering",

The expectation will probably be you\u2019re not working there 10 years but you pivot to a job with better hours quickly so pursuing marriage/kids is very realistic option when you start in IB",

Often they don't like finance majors because they all have the same training and think the same while an art major has different logical processes. Connections certainly help, but it's also school name",

Definitely tough work for sure but if you break into IB it will literally set you up for life.

Other people here are saying don\u2019t do it if you\u2019re not \u201cpassionate\u201d about it or whatever, that\u2019s stupid. Barely anyone I know is \u201cpassionate\u201d about working 80 hour weeks and fixing powerpoint slides for hours or whatever, but you do it because it will set you up AMAZINGLY for the rest of your life to enjoy a ton of other things when you get rich. It\u2019s working hard for a few years as an analyst to get a huge reward in the future, it\u2019s no different than studying hard in school\n\nLike even if you love comp sci for example I guarantee you nobody feels \u201cpassionate\u201d about doing those impossible problem sets until 3 am lmao, but it\u2019s the same idea it\u2019s totally valid to work and grind hard because you know it will set you up for a lot of money and success in the future and let you live something much closer to your ideal lifestyle when you get older. \n\nBurnout and everything is definitely common in IB and finance but so is like every other top paying job. Doctors have to suffer through residency and med school, lawyers have to suffer a ton too early in their careers, the comp sci kids I know at school are busy all day lmao. If you want to be wealthy and successful which are completely valid and understandable goals and why most people are trying to go to top schools in the first place, if you can break in it\u2019s completely valid to pursue IB even if those 2 years as an analyst will be the hardest years of your live and you\u2019re not enjoying every second of it lol. Because when you\u2019re in your 30s and making mid 6 figures and you can send your kids to the top schools or go on vacations with your SO or whatever u want to do one day, you\u2019ll appreciate all the work you put in before",

STEM majors are indeed versatile, but if you don't go that route, there are other options too. One of my family members is IB in NYC and they double majored in Classics and Econ.\n\nAlso, although they graduated from a target, it was not 'easy', nor was it because of connections that they were able to get a big bank job. It takes a lot of work and it is incredibly competitive. Make sure you have options.",

Firstly, though, check WSO out for more information on IB and finance careers in general- this sub is dedicated to college admissions and the like, not a really niche career field like IB. \n\nThat said, my advice is do not pursue IB/PE for the money or \u201cprestige\u201d (whatever the hell that is) as many people do. You need to pursue it because you do have some level of genuine interest in it or you\u2019re not going to survive 100 hour work weeks. I do think the hours can be a tad overblown sometimes, especially when many people are referencing the deal boom of late 20\u2019 through early 22\u2019, but there is an element of truth to them. \n\nIt\u2019s a common interview question you\u2019re going to have to answer but you should ask it of yourself: why are you pursuing IB/PE? Is it to be able to critically evaluate an investment opportunity and project out potential levers for growth? Is it because you want to build a technical skillset of financial modeling, accounting, and some other useful tools that you can utilize in your career? I mean heck why wouldn\u2019t you want to do SWE at a FAANG company working half as many hours for similar comp (at least at lower levels)- you better have a damn good reason. Me personally I do genuinely find finance interesting, and the opportunity to invest and then partner with management in PE sounds cool as hell. I could never code all day even if it is a more sensible choice WLB because it just doesn\u2019t intellectually stimulate me. \n\nAll in all you\u2019re a rising senior, and while it\u2019s admirable to be thinking this far ahead, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it quite yet. Hell, I didn\u2019t even know what IB was until my sophomore year of college. I\u2019d recommend hopping on LinkedIn and trying to find some people in the IB/PE world you can network with directly. You\u2019ll be able to ask them more pointed questions and hear about their experience and their views on the profession and see if it\u2019s of interest to you- plus you get to form a genuine connection. That\u2019s really the only way you\u2019ll be able to figure out if this is for you a forum is not going to be able to answer the question.",

And what I was more so referencing is the exit opportunities a career in investment banking provides. Thats why people do it. You can go into private equity or venture capitalism and make 500k as an associate working wayyyy less hours. You can go c-suite route (lot more work) and make multiple 7 figs. Having an investment banking role on ur resume is pretty nice in the corporate world",

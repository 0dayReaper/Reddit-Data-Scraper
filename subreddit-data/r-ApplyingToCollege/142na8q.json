    "postText": "What do I do with scholarship checks?\n\nI recently got scholarships from my school and was given checks. On the check, it has only my name on it and not the name of my college. It does mention that it is a scholarship on the check.\n\nSo my question is; what do I do with them? Like do I just deposit it in my personal account? Do I have to tell my college about it/what would I label them as in my scholarships tab? How do I use them to pay for my tuition?\n\nI\u2019m beyond confused. Thank you for any insight provided!",

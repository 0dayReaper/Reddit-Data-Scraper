    "postText": "I\u2019m about to start applying to college and I have a 3.9 UW GPA pretty bad SAT but i\u2019m retaking it this year and I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll do good as I only did bad due to timing issues that I have fixed. I\u2019m confident in my ACT score as well and I\u2019ll be submitting but SAT and ACT. My issue is i have very little extracurriculars. I\u2019ve been volunteering at a shelter my mom runs for years now. I technically joined Women empowerment club but they only had 2 meetings before it was canceled (which i\u2019m thinking of starting up again with my friend as president and vice president) I will also be joining MSA and pairing that with my moms shelter for donations this year. I joined crochet club for a year. This would be my 3rd year in piano which I practice outside of school as well but there is an Academic Decathlon class at my school which I could join but i\u2019d have to drop piano or give up my only free period. that would make 2 years of piano or a stressful senior year. I also had a shift lead position at a fast food restaurant and currently work at a retail store as a sales associate for the past 7 months I had both jobs at one point. Should I drop piano or my free period to do acdec or keep it as it is. I\u2019m sorry for how long this is any advice would be appreciated.",

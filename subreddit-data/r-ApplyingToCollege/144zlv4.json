            "comment": "&gt;Do college visits increase the chances of being accepted?\n\nDepends. Some universities consider 'demonstrated interest', one way to help with this is to visit the university.\n\n&gt;Because I\u2019m an international student and visiting colleges in the US won\u2019t be possible for me. \n\nDon't worry too much, it usually doesn't count for much unless you ED. ED, or Early Decision, is the ultimate way to show demonstrated interest.",

            "comment": "Some colleges track demonstrated interest but if they do they count a virtual visit the same as an actual visit because they know lots of students don't have the means to visit in person. Once you have your college list make a note of which ones track interest and for those make sure you sign up for virtual visits and info sessions (this is good to do for all your colleges to gain info for your own benefit, but especially important for colleges that track interest.)",

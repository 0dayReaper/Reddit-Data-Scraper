    "postText": "I was planning to transfer to a CSU in Spring of '24 with 45 completed credits at a CC and 15 planned for Fall of 23/24. I thought this was totally normal but I'm seeing some people and some sites say that you have to have all 60 credits completed by Summer '23, which is not possible for me to do. Has anyone been admitted for a Spring semester with classes planned/in progress? I would appreciate any information, very stressful time right now.",

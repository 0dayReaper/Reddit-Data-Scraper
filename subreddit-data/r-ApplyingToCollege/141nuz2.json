It's so much easier to learn the material quickly when it's Algebra vs trying to cram AP Calc.\n\nIf you start ahead, it's easier to stay ahead and learn more as far as education. The same goes for extracurriculars. Also, make sure to explore. A big thing I realized, was that especially for instruments, if you don't burn out and consistently practice, you can get really far even if you didn't start at age 5 - that's more of the case for mainstream stuff like soccer or basketball.\n\nI wish I tried so much more stuff in middle school. Always try and choose the advanced stuff etc and don't be afraid of failure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, would to be as much of an extrovert and super nice person as possible.

If they start their foreign language credits in middle school, they can get ahead on those, as well as getting serious about math at an early age.  If you look at the most competitive students, they did those 2 things, and definitely had some coaching from parents and teachers on that.  Valedictorians at my kids school definitely did both of those. Not that it\u2019s necessary for success. But it\u2019s what it takes to be a super high achiever.  It\u2019s not about starting the college conversation, it\u2019s about lining things up for the student so that they are competitive when they get to the stage of applying to college.",

Most private schools here are religious and while we are comfortably upper middle class, I'd rather help fund his college education than his high school education. \n\nHe's happy. Compared to my high school experience, I can't put a dollar value on the fact that he is happy. \n\nAs a parent, his mental health, happiness and love of learning is worth leaving him exactly where he is. There is no guarantee I can find better, and with the lottery system, no guarantee I could get him back in if we left.\n\nDoes it suck he's limited, absolutely. Will I take the W because he's happy- every single time",

Money is helpful, but it's not everything. Enjoying your career will make a hard day livable, hating your work makes an easy day torture.

But prestige both in college and career is so overrated and honestly borderline toxic.\n\nA good majority of students went to my college because of the prestige, the connections, and it being a path to make a ton of money. The other group actually liked learning and wanted to be in an environment with some of the best learning/education and cared less about the prestige and post-grad prospects. The latter were obviously much more pleasant and genuinely better people.\n\nBut overall, prestige is just another \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses\u201d that means literally nothing.

Demonstrated initiative is absolutely important in college admissions. Finally, 4) (your bonus) get good at meeting new people and speaking with strangers.

Rn prestige in programs doesn\u2019t matter but if you start now and get good skills in art, music, sports, etc you\u2019ll have a much easier time in hs to not learn the basics. It can be through absolutely anything like paid classes, summer programs, community workshops, school itself, whatever just get the skill. Prestigious programs and club building comes later. \nAlso, don\u2019t figure out what you want to be because that will change for sure. Know what you DON\u2019T want to study. Like STEM vs non-STEM, but don\u2019t shut out borderline stuff like econ or design or psych. You\u2019ll know how to better dedicate your time towards finding your passion if you at least know what exactly you don\u2019t like and what you might like.",

And as many mentioned college is often a paper qual for a ton of jobs but can be worthless or infinitely empowering, all how you use it. \n\nAnd know you can mess up in middle school, HS, community or college, and you\u2019ll be ok.

In middle school you\u2019re still a child and you shouldn\u2019t be forced to think so seriously about your future. It\u2019s so detrimental and I wish I and the adults around me had just let me be a kid.\n\nI also would have petitioned more to have my disabilities accommodated. I had (and still have) diagnosed disabilities that just weren\u2019t accommodated and even though I was doing fine, I had to work 3x as hard as all the other students and could have been doing so much better. I was completely fucked over in high school because even though I did eventually get accommodations, I\u2019d lost so much time from not having that support for so long that I still struggled. Even though everything turned out okay for me in the end the fact that I had to work so much harder than everyone else when I didn\u2019t need to and all the more potential that I had that I just couldn\u2019t express makes me angry just typing this.\n\nOh, I also wouldn\u2019t have let my parents make me take Algebra I when I was 11 and in 7th grade. That fucked me over.",

At the beginning of my 6th grade year parent conference or I think open house with my teacher I was told I was able to apply to my schools advanced program because she believed I was hardworking and smart(clique ik). I was feeling special and considering it but the moment she said it will be difficult \u201cbut you got this\u201d I backed out. I took the application she gave me and never applied. My mom never encouraged me because she didn\u2019t understand English and didn\u2019t want to push me to do something I didn\u2019t want to do. As a first generation student I was afraid of not knowing what the challenge entailed and I was afraid to do it by myself bc my parents weren\u2019t able to help me.   This is my biggest regret because of the self doubt I had at a young age. If I would\u2019ve applied, things would\u2019ve been different definitely but I wouldn\u2019t know that for sure. \n\nAnother thing is continue taking academics seriously. I would listen to other students saying as long as you get this grade you pass etc. My academic perseverance turned into me slacking off and barely trying both in class and with hw. This definitely impacted me but things have changed! ;)lol this is long",

I had perfect scores, perfect grades, lots of friends, and everyday was a lot of fun although I got into my fair share of trouble here and there (nothing harmful, just good ol fun and maybe talking too much) but honestly high school would be were i should've changed things. My honor roll self thought joining one of the most advanced programs in education offered in american high schools would be a good idea but apparently my work effort stood in the way. It was a very demanding program that needed lots of focus and dedication to your work and as smart as I am, I put very little effort into what I was doing all the way up till HS, so I didnt actually know how to try or properly study. Ofc my ego and general lack of wanting help posed an even bigger issue and put me into a deeper hole I had already dug. It hurt me in the long run, especially now trying to apply for things and looking back at my grades. So if I could go back to maybe 8th grade, I would make sure to actually try from 9th grade onwards and to not let the ease of middle school honors make high school honors/AP/IB seem underwhelming when in reality you actually need to try",

Be open to new ideas including ones that might make you uncomfortable. Learn how to find primary source material in any field - like if you love art, stop looking at fan art and start finding primary source material. If you love a particular writer, find out who they read. And if you love anything having to do with the humanities, treat it like a sport - learn your craft. Study how others do your craft.

The unfortunate truth of the matter is that if you want to be at the very top of your class you will need to squeeze in as many APs as possible. Prioritize APs relating to your major and interests. Also, take at least 3 years of foreign language, and, ideally, get to the AP level.\n\nStudy for the SAT starting the summer before 11th grade with UWorld (360 day memerbship that you should time using the April test date) and by taking a practice test every Saturday morning.

If you have an idea or cause that you deeply care about, don't hesitate to start a nonprofit organization. It will not only give you a sense of purpose but also help you develop leadership, organizational, and teamwork skills.\r  \n\r  \nWrite a book: Writing a book is a fantastic way to express your creativity, share your thoughts, and leave a lasting legacy. Whether it's a novel, a collection of poems, or a non-fiction work, start writing early. Middle school is a time when you have a lot of ideas and inspiration, so seize the opportunity and let your words come to life.\r  \n\r  \nConsider skipping a year of school: If you find that the pace of your current grade isn't challenging enough, you might want to explore the option of skipping a year. Talk to your teachers, counselors, and parents to understand the implications and feasibility of this decision. It can provide you with new opportunities, advanced coursework, and a chance to delve deeper into your academic interests.\r  \n\r  \nLearn a new language outside of school: While most middle schools offer language courses, they may not cover all the languages you might be interested in. Take the initiative to learn a new language outside of school through online resources, language exchange programs, or even by immersing yourself in a community of native speakers. Being multilingual opens doors to new cultures, opportunities, and career paths.",

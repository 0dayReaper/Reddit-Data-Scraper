    "postText": "Last year, I took a collective L during the college application process. They say that over time you start to get over it but a year later, I\u2019m still bitter, disappointed and jealous of others who got into their dream schools or had other excellent outcomes. I regret even thinking I was qualified to get into any T20 and questioning why I didn\u2019t just apply to targets and safeties, I probably would have ended up somewhere better than where I am right now. I know some of you will tell me to consider transferring but then I would have to think about how my social life would be with people having 2 year head starts. Just an endless cycle of unhappiness\u2026",

The past is over, the future is not here, so you can only live in the present.  \n\nYou develop character by making choices, taking responsibility, and working toward your goal.  Imagine how good you will feel when you enter that 4 year college, and even better when you get the degree from there.  Now get to work toward that.",

I have np idea where you ended up and how much on QS does your university ranks...But I will share with you a couple of real life stories with numbers and hope this gives you perspective ...\n\nI come from the Middle East, my colleagues and I have attended one of the best universities here but it ranks 300 on QS, all of my colleagues have an MS from HYPSM... The premed Students end up at Stanford and Duke for medicine...  I am currently in touch with a very successful professor at a University in the US  who graduated from a Univ that ranks 1000 on QS and did  his MS at Harvard ... So your BS is what you make of it as everyone says here ... ENjoy where you are and look for the next step...  ( PS we were architects )",

You are overhyping the true value of an undergraduate T20 education, and undermining your own worth. While you may have made a mistake in making your college list, or you may have simply gotten unlucky, you need to own up to the reality and move on. If you are still determined to graduate with a T20 degree, you can transfer, or you can sulk around for the next couple years about how the colleges royally screwed you over. If you\u2019re worried about friends or a social life, I guarantee you will find the right people at the right time, be it other transfer students or 4-year students. \n\nThe failures in your past represent an opportunity to succeed. If you do not learn from that failure and take that opportunity, you will struggle to succeed.",

            "comment": "The only outcome that truly matters is how you spend your four years of college.  Accordingly, your best bet is to stop posting on a high school college admission site and begin focusing on having a terrific upcoming year.  Start making sample schedules for the upcoming year after identifying prerequisites in your likely major(s), learning about your general education requirements (if any), and seeking out fun and/or exploratory electives.  Check out the university list of clubs and identify a half-dozen about which you\u2019d like to learn more at the activities fair.  Review the intramurals and outdoor activities that are offered through the recreation center and see on what date you can sign up for those that interest you.  Read about semester, winter break, and spring study abroad programs.  Start to invest in your upcoming experience. \n\nAlso, I appreciate that you are not already plotting your transfer.  Transferring can be a good move for a student who discovers that the academic program they now wish to study is not offered at their current university, or for a student who finds that the university is a poor fit culturally or socially.  But it has it\u2019s drawbacks.  A student who transfers may find that they haven\u2019t taken the prerequisites needed to declare their major on time at their new institution, extending their stay (and expense). Not all of the credits earned at the former institution may transfer.  The new institution may have more onerous or simply different general education requirements that must be completed.  And the transferring student will have lost 1-2 years in which to meet fellow students, forge relationships with professors, and get involved in clubs and activities.  So start by genuinely delving into the opportunities that are available at university one before seeking to transfer to university two.  The school to which one seeks to transfer will want to see solid grades, extracurriculars, and campus involvement, so investing in your current college gives you double the bang for the buck; it will hopefully make it clear that you\u2019d like to stay, but make it easier to leave if need be.\n\nVery best of luck.",

The sooner you realize that there is no perfect school, no perfect job, and that there is no perfect trajectory into a perfect life, the sooner you will be on your way to self fulfillment. But this involves developing flexible rather than rigid thinking and being open to the people and opportunities around you. Bloom where you are planted and make the most of where you are! If you feel unable to do that because of some kind of insurmountable social or curricula limitations for some reason, then take the initiative to transfer somewhere. But realize that transferring will not be the magic potion to solve all your problems, it just may open up different (and not necessarily better) doors for you.",

What your feeling is real and disappointing and maybe overwhelming. \n\nThat being said, the head starts just get bigger as you get older. Better to have a rough learning curve and \u2018catch up\u2019 to wherever you want to be now than keep doing down a path you\u2019re unhappy with and do a giant u-turn of sorts later.\n\nYou absolutely can transfer (and considering how unhappy you are, it sounds like maybe you should). Your social life will not necessarily take a hit. There are SO many ways to make friends in school. \n\nAlso, while I would very seriously consider transferring - depending on your goals in life, I\u2019d also consider a gap year to help figure it out. There are even a bunch of schools that have programs especially for students who\u2019ve been away from school and if you take a gap year, you could become one of those students - like the school of General Studies at Columbia (no material difference to the College), the Eli Whitney program at Yale (*may need more than just one gap year for that, but you also get to study alongside \u2018normal\u2019 Yale students). Etc. \n\nThere are SO many options and the only one you know for a fact you should do, is you should not stay where you\u2019re miserable. Good luck out there!",

Yes the first two years were fun but by my junior year I felt something was missing in my social life.  I was growing as a person and felt I was not making deep connections with my current friends.  When junior year began I met a few new friends - all transfers from CCs.  These were magical friendships and I had the best of times with them, even finding an apartment together with one of them.  Then more lifelong friends came after college in my graduate school years.  We went through dating life, weddings and having children together.  The friends who are content now are ones who made it to their career/personal goals - regardless of which colleges took them there.  Some day you will look back and think, oh, that\u2019s was nothing.  Why did I stress myself out.  (I hope - good luck).",

I just finished my freshman year at my local city college, and guess what? I don\u2019t care about the rejections anymore or where my friends from HS are. Most people in your place don\u2019t either. They _shouldn\u2019t._\n\nIf you are well into college &amp; still bitter &amp; jealous of your friends, you need to get over it. It\u2019s okay to feel like that for a month or two after your rejection but a year later is insane. In all likelihood, they probably stopped thinking about you after graduation, you need to do the same.\n\nAnd another thing\u2014if you don\u2019t even want to transfer, then why are you complaining about your situation? You are basically stuck at your current college until graduation and/or grad school. You may as well ride it out. You could give in and fill out a transfer app, but you need a valid reason to leave your school &amp; T20s know when people are just being prestige whores. They can smell horseshit from a mile away and will straight up reject you regardless of your stats.\n\nI\u2019m saying this with your best interest in mind: move on. It only gets better after you realize there\u2019s nowhere else to go but up, so embrace your circumstances &amp; make the most of your current school.",

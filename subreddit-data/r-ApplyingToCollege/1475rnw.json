    "postText": "My senior year course load is AP Physics 1, AP Calc AB, AP English Lit, US 2 Honors (I moved countries so i've to take US classes now) and IB TOK HL.\n\nI could only take 2 AP and 1 Honors class Junior year cause I moved countries and I really wanted to make up for rigor senior year as I couldn't take any advanced classes in freshman and sophomore as they weren't offered. I could've taken APUSH instead of US 2 and AP Econ instead of IB TOK but I dint know it and its too late. Is this still rigorous enough or did I mess up? i'm gonna be taking an economics class in a college near my school as well to get some credits.",

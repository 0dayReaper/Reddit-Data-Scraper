            "comment": "&gt;How likely are colleges to approve deferring admission until the next year?\n\nDepends on whether the college allows **any** student to defer. For UVA, they say:\n\n&gt; All first-year students admitted to UVA as undergraduates can request to take a gap year after they complete high school, prior to enrolling at the University. To request consideration for a gap year, students must pay their enrollment deposit by May 1 to secure their place in the class and fill out the form in their Application Portal, located near the bottom. The deadline for the form is July 1. Students will be notified if their gap year is approved within two weeks. Requests should include a tentative gap year plan for the coming year.\n\nhttps://admission.virginia.edu/i-am/admitted-student\n\n&gt; additionally my dad has an office opening up in the state I was admitted to and we may be moving there( would I then pay in-state tuition?)\n\nDepends on the state. For Virginia, that's a hard no.",

Unless you have a really strong reason to prefer, say, Brown, seems like it might make more sense for you to use a \"reach\" that way given your overall Texas preference.  As others have said, Texas also has other well-known privates like SMU and Baylor you could consider.  Trinity is a good LAC.

You can look at other Texas privates, but they will likely be safeties with your stats, which is fine, but it doesn\u2019t really help your list unless you would prefer to attend them rather than TAMU. I generally found that TAMU was better in cost/education to almost all the Texas privates aside from Rice (SMU mad expensive). \n\nI\u2019d either stick with the list or MAYBE add more ivies if you think you\u2019d want to attend them? It will look very reach-heavy, but your restrictions pretty much limit UT to being your only target, and TAMU is a very good safety (and you should have auto) so you wouldn\u2019t need many there.\n\nAlso, are they so set on the Ivy brand that schools like Duke/Stanford/Johns Hopkins and others don\u2019t count? If that\u2019s the case then you\u2019d really just be selecting your reaches from the Ivy League, have UT as a target, and any safeties you choose in-state. It\u2019s a strange list, to be sure, but that\u2019s how it is looking.",

That\u2019s about the 15 hardest schools to get into in the country. Really limited to the far reaches lol, but I\u2019d look into all of them since just looking into them doesn\u2019t take that long.\n\nI\u2019d check with your parents about liberal arts colleges, but I doubt they would acquiesce if Vanderbilt doesn\u2019t qualify. \n\nIf you were constructing a list of 20 schools first, then you could probably throw all 15 of the far reaches on it, put UT, TAMU, and you\u2019d still have 3 spots left for Texas privates or another Texas public. Although personally I don\u2019t think all 15 of those reaches are necessary, and you can cut some out you might not want. Not sure how the final list would come out, but UT and TAMU would definitely be there.",

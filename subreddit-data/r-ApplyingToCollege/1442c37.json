    "postText": "I got a 3.7 in freshman year after not taking school seriously, then a 3.81 in sophomore because I did really well in humanities. This year, with 3 APs, I\u2019m going to end on a 3.95 UW! I\u2019m a little upset about the A- in math, given that I kept making careless mistakes and sabotaging myself, but I genuinely thought that I would never achieve anything above 3.85 in high school. I worked hard at the end of the year and it brought my trend wayyy up! Thought I would end with A-s and B+s, but my teachers told me I was underestimating myself. To anyone who thinks they\u2019ll never be the picture perfect student we see every day on this sub, you can do it!",

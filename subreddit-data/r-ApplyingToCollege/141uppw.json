    "postText": "So, I committed to USC and got into Tufts off the waitlist just today. I have a week to decide \\[finances in this case, do not matter - which is something I'm very privileged to not worry about!\\]\n\nTufts Pros:\n\n* BOSTON! It's closest to one of my favorite cities in the world. I was also born there :) and it has a really special place in my heart.\n* Met the faculty and people at Admissions tours and loved em! Really nice human beings :)\n* Solid healthcare scene, internships for science/research, etc. - bigger focus on healthcare IMO.\n* Dual-degree program: science and art.\n* My best friend is going there! \\[not a factor in my decision, but it's a pro that I would like to add for fun hehe\\]\n\nTufts Cons:\n\n* Smaller name than USC? Idk for med school, if both are similar at least, but in the real world, I feel like people know USC more. Then again, it could be more different regionally. I'm hoping to go to med school in the East of the U.S., and I haven't heard much noise from USC there either. IK USC is good for UC's tho!\n* I met people at USC already (roommate, a few classmates, etc), so it's just awkward having to say: \"Hey so um I'm actually not going to this school anymore . . . lolz . . peace out.\"\n\nUSC Pros:\n\n* In Los Angeles! It's a totally new vibe, going to a new city for uni would be spontaneous but also, really eye-opening!\n* Met my roommate, other classmates, etc. ! So far, people are nice \\[at least, the people who I have been able to connect to :))\n* Got my major! Prehealth, health and human sciences hehe.\n\nUSC Cons:\n\n* In Los Angeles . . . very questionable location in terms of safety.\n* A lot of frat parties/culture - I don't really party much/go to frat/sororities, and I feel like there are a lot of people who do that.\n* Am not in Freshman Science Honors \\[rip I got waitlisted\\].\n* Lots of entertainment focus? From what I can see with alumni, etc. I feel like it supports more of the music/entertainment industry rather than the healthcare industry, but maybe it's b/c I'm not a student there yet.\n\nOther stuff: both campuses are beautiful, near major cities, etc. so for that, those aren't really my concerns lol. \n\nA bit conflicted - would like some advice. Thanks you guys - sending love!! &lt;3",

            "comment": "Honestly it seems that you like Tufts better from this post. From my understanding your undergrad school isn't really important for med school admissions, so you want to choose somewhere you'll be able to thrive in to get a high GPA and somewhere that has good medical opportunities for stuff like research or shadowing or whatever (idk much about premed lol). It seems to me that Tufts would be the better place for you to do that.",

    "postText": "I wouldn't call UCLA my dream school or anything, but it has a lotta qualities I'm looking for in a school: large, public, good reputation, and in a major city. Unfortunately, I know I'm far from meeting  its high application standards so I'd like to know of any schools that share the aforementioned qualities, but are a little more forgiving with their applicant expectations. \n\nFor some context, I'm a rising junior who will most likely finish high school with an unweighted GPA of around 3.4-3.7 (probably 3.5-3.6) and good, but not exceptional ECs.",

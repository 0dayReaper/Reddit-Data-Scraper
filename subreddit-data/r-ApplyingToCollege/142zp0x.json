    "postText": "So I am going to be a senior next fall and I have already started one of my essays. It is the common app one about what can keep you interested for hours. But my question is about the \u201cWhy Us\u201d essay. Should that be included in my common app essay or is that an entirely different one? Thank you",

            "comment": "\"why us essays\" usually refer to a common prompt several colleges choose for their supplemental essays. they differ in wording, but boil down to \"why do *you* want to go to our school? why should *we* admit *you*?\"\n\nSince this essay is school-specific, you would not be writing it into your common app essay (personal statement). It would be a supplemental essay, which can be accessed in common app after you add colleges. That said, supplemental essays may change year to year and common app does not update until August, so remember that while working in advance.",

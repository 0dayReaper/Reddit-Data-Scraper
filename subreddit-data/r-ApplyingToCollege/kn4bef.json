If you're a billionaire you make the vast majority of your money from owning investments and capital gains tax maxes out at 20%. Throw in all the ways that they can cheat the system and it drops even lower.\n\nDo you remember hearing about the Panama papers a few years back? Virtually every ultra rich person in the world has offshored big chunks of money. Also the reporter who leaked it was killed with a car bomb.",

Apple, Amazon, Google have all provided services that everyone uses. Tesla is changing the world of automation and solving climate change more than any government or organisation has done despite a lot more funding. But no no no, these billionaires are so evil. \n\nYou're so educated to that you use the strawman \"trickle down economics bad\" to shut down supply-side economics. It's not like the rich people that funded all of these companies and people wouldn't have had the money to create all these great companies or anything like that. Supply side policies bad despite them ending stagflation, increasing GDP growth, causing an entrepreneurship revolution, and making the United States the global powerhouse that it is.\n\nYou're the educated one here. The rest of us on A2C are just measly inferior peasants compared to you, a distinguished Professor of economics. There is no laughable irony in your comment whatsoever.",

If you are well off, you pay full amount. Isnt this the \"progressive\" system all wanted where the well off people pay full amount? I mean yea people in the upper middle class would get fucked but that is what socialism is about. It basically crushes the upper middle class by making them pay for the poorer people which eventually brings them down to the poor class in the end. Then the government would have to turn to the rich to collect even more taxes to support these poor people but the rich would simply leave the system. And that's how the system collapses. This has happened countless times, but these young naive teens never listen and always fall for it. Hundreds of tech companies are leaving california every year including the big ones such as Hewlett Packard, Oracle, etc. How long do you think this \"progressive\" system is going to last when all the rich have left the town?",

I also think the determination of this top 30% should be equalized for income, so that low income students can be fairly compared to higher income students. Success in high school is the main predictor for success in college, so investments should be scaled accordingly. Lenders should also be held to the same standards - a loan given to a C student is riskier than one given to A students, so the interest rates offered, and the rating of that investment should reflect that. \n\nThis addresses incentives to curb the inflationary effects of student loan availability. It also does a better job in directing the money to where it can do the most good.\n\n*Doesn't have to be 30%, just some sort of limit to the number of students that will be subsidized, vs. a system in which everyone who meets a particular criteria gets subsidized.",

I am in no way blaming poor students, but if you are a not studious and are going into a degree with little job opportunity, banks shouldn\u2019t give you a loan.

    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been self reflecting recently and I\u2019ve come to a realization that I despise doing one of my activities. However, it\u2019s the one activity that I\u2019ve been with for all 4 years, won multiple national awards in, and am a low level officer in. It\u2019s a major time commitment, but I am sad to say that I just have no joy in doing it anymore. \n\nI\u2019m conflicted. On one hand, continuing it for one more year shows commitment, but on the other hand I don\u2019t know if I can juggle this activity + others + commonapps next year and do well in all of them.",

            "comment": "... honestly? It's up to you. Like, sorry for giving the shittiest reply, but sit down for a bit, and then think hard about the two choices. What the daily life looks like, etc etc. And then sleep on the choice. You took a lot of time doing the acitivity, and you also look like you really hate the activity. So think hard about it. \n\nIf you think the time investment you made isn't getting the return you want, and you want something for the time you committed, do it for the last year.\n\nIf you think shit's not worth it, just drop it. 3 years of commitment with alot to show is still an incredible feat, and if an extra year invested makes you think your mental health and happiness will be lost, drop the topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly depends on what your personality prefers. I have known people who commit to finish, and prioritise finishing what they started above most of the things, and I've seen people prioritze their happiness above everything.  Just think long and hard, and go for whatever you feel makes you more content with life.",

If you apply in the fall, perhaps you can join your clubs again in the fall then pull back from the time commitment shortly afterward without \"quitting\" the club.  You will still have a completely truthful EC, and everything done before today is also still truthful and valid.",

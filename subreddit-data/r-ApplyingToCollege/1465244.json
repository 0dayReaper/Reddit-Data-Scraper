    "postText": "School doesn\u2019t give out GPA, but self-calculated 3.8UW with strong upward trend. 1540 SAT, retaking in August. Maybe taking the ACT. \n\nECs/things that may not count including plans for next year (basically all of these were started this year because of mental health circumstances with lockdown): Summer camp work (2y), member of my school\u2019s Trans Non-Binary Alliance (3y) with pubsec position for next year, school choir (1y), member of my school\u2019s Alliance for Neurodivergent Students (2y) with plans to run for VP or pubsec next year and get the club a school publication (elections were postponed), artist for school newspaper (1y), part of my school\u2019s \u201cbig sib\u201d program to sort of mentor middle schoolers (2y)\n\nAPs/Honors: AP CS-A, planning on taking AP stats and AP calc AB, honors math by default. APs are kind of weird at my school though (they can\u2019t teach AP lit or lang because we\u2019re done with the curriculum before we\u2019re at the age to take it, you can only start APs in jr year and have a max of 6 by graduation, max 2 in jr and max 4 in sr)\n\nI\u2019m diagnosed autistic and live in a single parent household with one parent overseas so my ECs are limited for my own sake. \n\nI\u2019ve visited a few extreme reaches but the only one I liked was UChicago. My counselor said that \u201cif there ever was a UChicago student, it would be me\u201d but my stats aren\u2019t good enough. \n\nI live in NYC and I want a school in a city (big or small, but can\u2019t live without the convenience lol). Tuition isn\u2019t a dealbreaker for me but it might be something I have to weigh when considering options. Don\u2019t qualify for financial aid and might get a masters, so expensive tuition is something to consider. \n\nI go to an ivy feeder with pretty bad grade deflation sometimes so other students at my school will look better by comparison. \n\nOther \u201cextreme reaches\u201d (according to counselor) I haven\u2019t visited but may be interested in: NYU, BU, Northeastern\n\nPlanning on applying undecided, but considering a stats or math major. \n\nAny good targets/safeties? Sorry for long post.",

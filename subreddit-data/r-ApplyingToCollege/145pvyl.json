The people that have sports be a big EC are recruited athletes (obviously) or people that have played the same sport to a very high level (national/international competition). Generally, those people have been practicing the same sport for a lot of years, sometimes 10+. For you, the AOs won't really view your sports stuff as a big plus or minus.",

            "comment": "I don't think it looks bad or holds you back IF you are an otherwise competitive candidate.\n\nBut of course sports is one of the ways in which you can show passion, dedication, and leadership.  Including if you are not a recruited athlete, in which case it appears sports is more or less treated as a type of EC.\n\nFor example, here is some of what Harvard said about getting a 2 score on athletics as revealed in the Harvard lawsuit (1s largely went to recruited athletes):\n\n\"Strong secondary school contribution in one or more areas; possible leadership role(s).\"\n\nCompare that with what Harvard said about EC 2s:\n\n\"Strong secondary school contribution in one or more areas such as class president, newspaper editor, etc. Local or regional recognition; major accomplishment(s).\"\n\n\"Significant school, and possibly regional accomplishments: for example, an applicant who was the student body president or captain of the debate team and the leader of multiple additional clubs.\"\n\nThese are similar-sounding requirements.  To summarize the expert analysis in the lawsuit, it appeared to be fine for an unhooked candidate who was a 2 in both academics and personal to be either an athletic 3 (\"active participation\") or 4 (\"little or no interest\") . . . as long as they were an EC 2 instead.  But, if you were only a 3/4 in athletics and also only a 3 in ECs (\"solid participation but without special distinction\") or 4 (\"little or no participation\"), you very likely were not getting in as an unhooked applicant.\n\nOK, so in Harvard speak, your stated pattern of athletic participation may cap you at being an athletic 3 and not 2.  Which would not hold you back . . . as long as you were an EC 2.\n\nAnd just based on your description, you might be on track for an EC 2, although I think that depends on things like club/individual achievements and the level of leadership.  Like, Harvard seems to be looking for the sort of people who are actually the top leaders in one or more major activities for the school, the kind of activities the school is known for regionally or at least locally.  So, if your school has a good debate team, an EC 2 would be captain of the debate team, that sort of thing.\n\nBut anyway, if you did satisfy a selective school's requirements for being their equivalent of Harvard's 2 for ECs, I suspect in most cases merely being their equivalent of a Harvard 3/4 for athletics would not matter.  But, for the most selective schools, unhooked applicants tend to need to be the equivalent of a Harvard 2 for activities in some way--could be captain of a prominent academic team, or captain of a prominent sports team, or so on.\n\nOf course a long list of other good colleges might be fine if you were sufficiently over-qualified academically, even if in all your activities you were merely a solid but undistinguished participant.  It is just the most selective colleges that seem to basically require that \"2\" level of activities participation out of their unhooked candidates.  Which makes sense because virtually no one is over-qualified for them academically.",

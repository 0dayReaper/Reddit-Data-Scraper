That pushes your take home down towards a salary you didn't need a college degree to achieve, much less 4 extra years of school, and it may be hard to even pay rent in high cost of living areas. Besides that, it's not like they're just sitting around 9-5 observing \"real\" doctors for that residency - in inpatient/surgery specialties, they often have to work 100 hours a week and do many of the things a full attending physician does.  Basically, it's still worth it to many people and you'd hopefully make enough to make up for those years, but it just seems shitty to work people to the bone for next to no take home pay because \"that's the way it works, and we can\".  My brother's wrapping up medical school in a big city and his fiance is a teacher, and I know they're really stressed about finances in the coming years and the fact they won't be able to consider affording to have children until he's in his mid thirties \n\nEdit: just to be clear, I'm not saying its not worth it in the long term, just that it truly does suck for what ends up being up to 20% of your career ",

Some comments were a little harsh imo though. Like this one (and it has like 4 upvotes)-\n\n&gt;For those folks please consider not going to college (unless you had a **really** bad day when taking it)\n\n&gt;True, the SAT isn\u2019t an exact predictor by any means, but it is still of some value. What does it mean if you scored less than 600 out of 1200 available points? (Minimum score is 400)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s highly likely these people will drop out and have nothing to show having spent a lot of money.\n\nYou can definitely get into some colleges with a 980. The ones you can get into just won't have as many opportunities, which isn't the worst thing in the world. If you put in the work, you'll still get places in life just fine. I would just say that if you get an SAT score like 980, just consider whether college is right for you. The reason I say that is not because I view those with below average scores as an inferior race or something like that, it is because  there is a slightly higher chance  for  someone with a lower test score to not do as well in college. Standardized test scores aren't a hardset and full proof way of determining readiness, but there is some merit to it. That is why it is worth taking that into consideration when considering whether college is right for you. However, the thought process shouldn't be \"I have a 980, therefore college isn't for me\" it should be \"I have a 980. Looking at the statistics, this statistically means that I am predisposed to not doing as well in college. Let me think about whether this is true for me or not, as I know that statistics cannot be applied in a blanket fashion to everyone\". Then you simply proceed to think through the whole decision. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the vast vast majority of those with a 980 go off and do great things. But that doesn't change the fact that they are still more likely to not do as well in college. The most important thing is that you make an informed decision based off what you think you can achieve. Don't let anyone discourage you. If you want to go and you think you can do it, do it. If you think you have the discipline and can put in the work, do it. If you don't think you can do it, that's okay. Just make that decision an informed and thought out one, not one hastily made because someone told you you would probably end up dropping out.\n",

I'm currently less financially successful than many of my friends who got 500-600 points lower than me. \n\nNobody gives one piece of poop if you scored a 1600 on the SAT or if you scored a 800 on the SAT. All that matters is you can ace that midterm or final coming up or if you snagged that internship. Your SAT knowledge won't serve you for anything in college. The SAT is a test that tests itself.

Getting denied is not 100% gonna happen unless you try and see and if you don\u2019t get in then it\u2019s not the end of the world. As someone who had people tell him he wouldn\u2019t get into a college because of a bad test score or a bad grade, please don\u2019t let people be the final deciding factor for you. Researching is good but just don\u2019t let people other than the colleges be a deciding factor for you. Best of luck I believe in you all.",

If you are struggling in high school then there is a real possibility that you will struggle when actually in that college. It's the reason why colleges take academics into account. The drop out comment was not needed, but the general idea of what he was trying to convey was reasonable. College isn't the right path for everyone, and just because most kids here are applying to T20s doesn't mean that we need to encourage everyone to.\n\nI know people here have the opinion that the SAT and ACT are useless since they went from a 27 to a 34, but I trust the opinions of most top institutions when they say that these tests do correlate to success in college. The comments like \"The SAT literally says nothing xd I cured cancer with a 400 SAT\" are just plain stupid. People are missing the point that your ability to study/take a test is pretty much the most important skill for college. \n\nIf you are motivated to attend a 4year college then there should be no reason why you wouldn't retake a 980.",

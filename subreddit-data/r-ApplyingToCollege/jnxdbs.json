It is because of my real life experiences that authorize me the right to assert my refutation with such degree of confidence. My best friend is, by all regards, conventionally attractive; with full lips and startling blue eyes, her curls hang daintily around her sculpted cheek bones. What does this say about me, should there be no \"two pretty best friends... always one of them got to be ugly\"? Am I to concede defeat because societal conventions impress upon our population an unarguably false premise? Or shall I fight against the institution, freeing myself from the oppressive beauty standards that plague our civilization? Admit me into Stanford or I will sue for defamation of appearance.",

So, if you are the ugly friend, MAKE SURE you are showing them that, don't tell! \n\nA lot of students trip up on this essay, because they don't talk about themselves enough, and usually end up using all their word count to talk about how beautiful/ugly their friend is. DON'T DO THIS! The AOs want to know more about YOU, not about how hot of a tater tot your friend is. \n\nThe best way to stand out among a sEa oF aPpLiCaNTs is to open up the essay with a unique story that means a lot to you. MAKE SURE you are telling the AOs something about YOU that they won't find in the rest of your application. \n\nI hope this helps!

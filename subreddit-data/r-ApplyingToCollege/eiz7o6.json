Today the state provides 51% of the funding; the vast majority of the remaining funding (46%) is on the students.\nhttps://boardofed.idaho.gov/resources/fact-book/\n\nYou're right that the estimated cost of attendance is around 15k/yr, but that means, with the reduced state funding, pay remains low. In fact, our last COLA was unfortunately funded by raising tuition since the state did not allocate any extra funds.\n\nUnfortunately for our students, minimum wage is $7.25. This means most prevailing jobs in our area with a flexible work schedule pay $12 or less, and work-study students are only paid around $9.00/hr.",

It almost went bankrupt in the 70\u2019s and hand to sell off major assets. It\u2019s really made the most of its campus and location in NYC to rise steadily through the rankings since then, in a way few other schools have been able to imitate.",

That is higher than the average household [income](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/09/us-median-household-income-up-in-2018-from-2017.html) in the US. \n\nThat being said, whether NYU's tuition is worth it is still very debatable. The average salary at my state flagship for example is [46,000](https://career.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2019/04/2018-Annual-Report_copy_no_blanks.pdf), which sounds like a big difference, but it also costs way less than NYU and my state flagship isn't prestigious at all. This also ignores the importance of location in your salary expectations; NYU is located in NYC so of course the salaries are going to be higher; even someone taking a minimum wage job in NYC today will still get $15 an hr while TN's min wage is 7.25. And lastly, major makes a bigger difference than the university you go to. On average, students in English for example at a top school are still going to make less than a student at a random state flagship in engineering in comparison. As a good example of this, the average CS major at my state flagship made $78,000 (it's in the report). Princeton's average salary after graduation in comparison is [$72k](https://careerdevelopment.princeton.edu/sites/careerdevelopment/files/resource-links/annual_report_2016-17.pdf) in comparison.",

Also private prestigious schools are actually cheaper than most lower ranked universities. Sure they are labeled as like 70k a year but that\u2019s just the sticker price. In fact, low income families get to attend these schools without cost. MIT for example gives full ride scholarships to students whose families make less than 90k a year. Furthermore, the average grant is around 50k for MIT which drastically brings down the price and will likely costs the same as other lower ranked universities. The only people who pay the full price are rich. Aside from finances, most prestigious schools like MIT receive significantly more funding for research and their student faculty ratios allow for a better experience. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you can still get phenomenal research experience at lower ranked schools but usually it\u2019s better at these higher ranked private schools. These are the main reasons people choose to apply to schools like MIT.",

Private insurance only guarantees you a certain network of hospitals.\n\nSecond, about duplicative healthcare. It COMES AFTER the success of medicare. That's how it goes for european countries with single payer healthcare.  Not the opposite. You need to make sure you can insure single payer before you allow private insurance.\n\nI will explain.\n\nIf you allow duplicative healthcare then healthcare companies can establish a tiered system and drive medicare users out of the system. *Then they can come up with an excuse that \"medicare for all\" doesnt work when it isn't.\n\nAnd the thing is, Biden is the morally shittiest among all the candidates.\n\n Iraq? Yes. \n\nEulogize white supremacists and a kkk member especially? Yes. \n\nVote for the crime bill that systemically has oppressed and continues to oppress minorities? Yes.\n\nBe pro segragationist in the civil rights era while someone like bernie sanders was marching with MLK? Yes.\n\nThat's biden.",

So no matter which way you slice it if you want to remove private insurance all together like some candidates want then you are basically destroying a good percentage of the economy. This is why Yang's plan is much better. It seeks to reform the healthcare industry and lower the corruption in it, there by causing rates to go down and quality of care to go up.\n\nThis can happen by making it so that doctors are now on salary instead of getting paid for each service. This will make it so that doctors have less of an incentive to prescribe useless medicine and tests. Another way is also controlling the price of drugs like Oxycotin so that big pharma companies cant charge Americans a ridiculous amount for prescription medicine when it is prescribed.\n\nAlso over the time private healthcare sector would become smaller. If you expand the current Medicare by lowering the age and eligibility requirements overtime it will be a much more smoother and realistic way to give more Americans healthcare.\n\nAs for the comments on Biden, that's not Yang, so I fail to see how that affects him. Just because you are kind and courteous to someone doesn't mean that you become that person and associate with their actions.",

It actually is not hard to sort out the process. In fact, it gets to the point where healthcare companies are willing to lower prices as they get more subsidized (in my own country's case).\n\nWhy will the industry not collapse:\n\n* The healthcare industry won't die if hospitals are still able to make a profit under the M4A model through returns on admin costs. (Explained later in comment)\n\n* More than 3/4 of physicians in surveys \"agree-strongly agree\" for M4A. They are fine with giving up some of their salary.\n\n* Majority of R&amp;D is funded by the government, or the NIH\n\nAgain, administrative burdens are what drive up those costs and cause doctor shortages. M4A WILL cut the bureaucracy, and studies show this. **An estimated $3-5tn can be cut off administration costs if drugs can be (which they can) price fixed.**",

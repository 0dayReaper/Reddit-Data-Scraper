    "postText": "Alright so basically what I\u2019ve noticed about people who get into top schools that I\u2019ve been friends with is that they\u2019re all nice people and actually have a life. If you have to study 24/7 and don\u2019t have time for a social life just to maintain good grades and good test scores, you don\u2019t belong at a top school. The people who belong at t20s are the people who actually have a life and passions beyond \u2018I need a 4.0 GPA and 36 ACT\u2019 they\u2019re just smart enough to get the 4.0 and 36 on top of that. Y\u2019all really need to chill because frankly not having a life is ruining your chances. When you look back and think \u2018why did I get deferred/denied? I had a 4.0, I studied every single hour, I joined 7 different ECs just for this college\u2019 then that is exactly why you got deferred/denied. Sure, there are some exceptions. But colleges don\u2019t want people with no outside competence and no perspective which so many of you display them wonder why you\u2019re not getting in to your top choices.\n\nEdit: just because you didn\u2019t get into a top school doesn\u2019t mean that you necessarily have no personality! Top schools are always hard, getting rejected even with good scores could be a lot of reasons\n\nEdit2:  I\u2019m apologize to any 1 specific person who read this and got upset. I am sure you have a life. I never tried to say that you didn\u2019t, you can have exactly 7 ECs but still have a life. The number was arbitrary, I didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone with the post it was just my opinion.",

You fall into a spot where you don't even care about your straight As or 1550 SAT score because you are so focused on getting into CalTech or MIT or Harvard or Stanford. If you don't get it, then it feels like all of that hard work was for nothing but the problems don't end if you do get in. Instead of being a stressed out high schooler focused on college, you are now a stressed out college student focused on keeping up with your peers, not letting yourself down, graduating with honors, setting yourself up for the best grad or med school, etc. \n\nMost of y'all just need to chill. I get that it's hard. My kids go to a high performing high school and the pressure is intense, but you can't spend your whole life focused on a future that you'll never allow yourself to actually enjoy.",

I firmly believe that the hardest part is getting in, and that the student's abilities had little to do with that. \n\nGrade inflation is insane. I was basically not allowed to fail students. I was required to ensure that my classes had a B average. Rebellious by nature, I addressed this by grading students incredibly harshly, failing almost the entire class on every assignment, and curving the grades to a B average. Students' writing skills were barely literate and made me strongly suspect that most had their entrance essays written by someone else, or the essay was not important in getting them accepted. I found myself not getting through biostatistics material because the students (sophomores) had never learned Microsoft Excel and I had to walk them through that. Many of my ecology students (freshmen) had clearly breezed through high-school without challenge, and had to be taught how to study and take notes. \n\nI have also taught at flagship State Universities with relatively low admissions standards (48% and 63%). Qualitatively, the only difference between students at the Ivy and at the public schools was that the class sizes at the ivy were significantly smaller, and the worst students weren't present. If you took the 5 best students from my public school classes, and randomly selected 15 from the remaining students who actually bothered to show up to class, you would have the kids in my Ivy classes.\n\nI believe it is truly one of the biggest scams in history that so many people believe that Ivy League students are the brightest our country has to offer. As I mentioned above, they were on par with my public school students. I will say that because of the smaller class sizes students received a somewhat better and much more personalized education, if they took advantage of it. But overall, once they were in, it was basically impossible for them to fuck it up, and most of my students put in the minimum amount of effort necessary so they could focus on socializing.",

But sometimes some students just doesn\u2019t realize that it\u2019s unhealthy, which is the target of my post if that makes sense.",

Your post wasn\u2019t particularly brutal, I\u2019ve seen much worse. :) But I disagree that your post, which is directed at someone who is already feeling paranoid and worthless, will \u201copen their eyes\u201d in any way. It will make them cling harder to their grades, a safety net. You are not the first person to tell them this, nor will you be the last. It is far more complicated than just \u201crecognizing\u201d a toxic mindset - it takes years to change that.\n\nHave a nice day.",

In fact, it is this ability to so perfectly capture experiences that I want to cultivate at Princeton, inspiring a new generation with my passions in video game design.\n\nIf you took away video games from me, it's not like I'm going to throw a temper tantrum because it's my life-long passion, but I am going to be somewhat frustrated until I replace that with something like tennis or football.\n\nBut with the paragraph I wrote, it makes it sound like video games are a cornerstone to my life and I would die to design them.",

And I just studied my ass off in my junior year of high school and same with sophomore. I only confined myself to one friend and just tagged on him for stability. Tbf my parents were first gen immigrants wo college education so I didn\u2019t grow up with books but hardcore video games. Eventually I study like 1000 hours for the SAT (more like several hundred) and get 1550. Then the essays I just wrote out woke thoughts I had. It wasn\u2019t that great but I felt like I manifested my personality from what I wrote in college apps instead of the other way around. I graduate valedictorian and go to Stanford. \n\nThe people here at Stanford? People who are used to their whole life naturally curious, ambitious, smart, and resourceful. I worked in high school a lot just to make myself feel better than my other peers, and I benefitted academically from self alienation. \n\nSo... yeah. I don\u2019t belong to go here. But guess what? Fuck you im here right now. Respect to anyone who can make it to Stanford from a first gen background. I may feel very culturally different from my peers but I realize now it\u2019s the companionship you feel from others that is worth it. \n\nI let myself have fun now in college and it\u2019s just now I see it was totally fine for me to work so hard in high school, but I should have definitely made more friends and do more social things. This early social development would\u2019ve helped me but I feel again my school is very awkward. I never had a friend group. Now I do. I feel a special sense to each person within our friend group, and it gets better from here. \n\nTLDR: this guy is right but Know first how much you are willing to sacrifice before you make it. I would fit better in a more introverted UC environment but I learned so much more about life eventually so it all works out. For me? I don\u2019t deserve it but it was fucking worth it.",

I did these activities because it was a good time with my friends and I got to learn things, which is what colleges are supposedly looking for \"intellectual curiosity\". I got a 36 without hundreds of hours of studying but there's always going to be that guy that [interned at NASA, wrote some new algorithm at CMU, etc. etc.] that's going to get in over me.",

I know a lot of really cool geeks and nerds whose lives _do_ revolve around studying, but they engage with the subjects they like in a way that\u2019s actually interesting to discuss with other people. Some people who aren\u2019t super scholarly might say that they\u2019re shut-ins, but I think the average person would think that, even though they study a _lot_, they do have lives and are interesting people.\n\nIf you feel that video games, studying, and movies are enough to give you a rich and fulfilling life, that\u2019s great. I think a lot of people with those hobbies, though, don\u2019t feel their lives are fulfilling or meaningful and that\u2019s where the problem comes in. Not hating life isn\u2019t the same as enjoying life, you feel me?",

In college I participated in student government and residential life. I did restoration in a Georgia swamp on Alternative Spring Break. I weaseled my way into a geology field trip with the graduate students. I wasn't even a geology major. I just really liked rocks and camping. Super dorky? Yes. But a great experience.\n\nEdit: Oh! And the time I (again) weaseled my way onto some training course for biology teachers that involved one of my professors sailing a boat to Key West. There was a terrible storm that prevented us from making it to Key West, so we ended up just sailing up and down the coast sunbathing, and going to clubs, and drinking Malibu rum. This is literally with my professor and a bunch of high school teachers. Luckily I turned 21 on the trip.",

Everyone wants someone that is outgoing but smart, when reality is quite off. Most of the people here, even though they vent their frustration at spending too much time and effort have a personality and a social life. But we somehow have to pretend \"you've got to have a something in order to get T20\", I'm sorry but I'll be blunt: the students are normal, as everyone else. They are hardworking, they have aspirations, they can be great as persons but also commit mistakes. \nYou are making it look like T20's should care about personality, for god's sake, maybe it's because I'm not American but colleges are first institutions of higher education and then communities. Let's stop judging our character for education, most people here are not even adults goddammit.",

The vast majority of students that feel like they NEED a 4.0 GPA/36 ACT etc. etc. generally go to high schools where people regularly get into such colleges and there's a general mindset that if you don't get in, you're 'stupid' or there's something wrong with you. I don't think you intended to come off this way, but it feels like you're saying \"unless getting into a T20 took very little effort for you, you shouldn't go there because you're not cut out for it.\" This is EXACTLY what contributes to Stanford Duck Syndrome type mindsets where students feel like they have to maintain the perfect image of balance, where they act like they don't study and get perfect grades, sacrifice sleep to seem like they have a life, or where they feel anxiety since everyone around them acts like they have it together. Yes, you'll be better off at a top school if you manage to have a good work/life balance, but I don't think we should be telling people \"you don't belong here if you don't.\"",

Let\u2019s say 20 years from now you\u2019re looking back at your life and there were two possible paths in high school:\n\n1) you worked hard and got a 3.6 GPA and a 1450 SAT. Which are very respectable. You studied a good amount but you made time for your family and friends and to build meaningful relationships. \n\n2) you have a 4.5 GPA and a 1590 SAT but you couldn\u2019t do much outside school other than study and work on extracurriculars which you only did for college apps.\n\nI GUARANTEE you would be much happier with the first option. Cause when you have a job and live alone you\u2019ll regret not spending more time with your mom, talking for half an hour about how your days were. Making sure your dad was okay cause he isn\u2019t perfect. Trying to help your siblings get through the difficult times they\u2019re  going through. \n\nAlso another thing yall have to understand is that a big name doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good school. \n\nFact: UIUC and Purdue are ranked higher than any of the ivies for engineering. \n\nHowever, no one cares about them but you go to Princeton for like music or smth and everyone makes a big deal out of it.\n\nWhat matters more than where you get your degree is what you do with it. \n\nI know people who have gone to very mediocre schools and become super successful \n\nI know people who have gone to amazing schools and crumbled after cause they thought their life was made out for them\n\nDon\u2019t put this much pressure on yourself to get into these universities when, in reality, they matter very little when it comes to everything life will throw at you after. \n\n\nPS. I got into a top ten engineering school in the world (although I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going) so I\u2019m speaking from experience and not just some salty senior that got rejected from MIT",

Well, i dont think its feasible for every highschool senior to have a legitimate passion they are passionate about. And college is where they can find it. Working hard to get into those colleges to be able to explore better opportunities later is not bad thing at all. I mean, while socializing and enjoying life may worth it as a personal development, devoting time to SAT/ACT would develop your critical thinking and other relevant skills. People are trying their hardest to be able to pursue their passion later in their life, and you can't blame it on them.\n\nNext, it seems like your generalizing. Those people who study 24/7 and work their ases off to maintain that 4.0 gpa aren't always bad at socializing. \n\nWhile it may be true that lack of character and personality in your app might reflect negatively, your completely ignorant and negative view towards those students seems a bit too much. Based on your last paragraph, I also can't understand how \"outside competence and perspective\" relates to socializing. In college apps, it's completely possible to show such \"competence and perspective\" without socializing(they can just pretend?) and still work hard. \n\nThey're trying their best to achieve their dream, and without a clear passion or goal, such approach to academics may be better for them. It simply doesn't make sense to say \"they don't belong at top schools\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwell, that's probably my unpopular response; it's like 3 am and I don't even know what I'm writing lol",

But people from poor background have to first get the academic knowledge before they can even compete.

I think that most high school students (not necessarily the ones you see on this subreddit) do extracurricular activities that they find fun and enjoyable, not because they think the activities will look great on their college resumes. It seems to me that if you\u2019re feeling this way, you must go to a very competitive high school. Maybe you feel like those students who work their butts off aren\u2019t genuine. But you don\u2019t necessarily know who these kids are outside of school. Maybe they love video games, or comic books, or nature, or baking, or filmmaking, but you only see the kid who tries to hard and has no life outside of school. Everyone, even the most \u201ctry hard\u201d person has a life outside of school, but the things they make time to do out of school might not be something they are listing on their college apps.\n\nThere are a ton of paths to top schools. You guys are teenagers. Some students have true academic passions in high school, but you don\u2019t need to have everything all figured out right now. Some of you are stressed out. Some of you are being pushed by their parents and some of you think you have it figured out but will change your minds once you enter college. You don\u2019t need to have your school work and social life and outside interests all perfectly balanced to get into a top school.\n\nWhen I was in college, I once told a professor that I wasn\u2019t sure if I chose the right major because I found my classes to be really challenging. She told be that it was supposed to be challenging\u2014that you don\u2019t major in something because it comes easy to you. Even the smartest, most naturally gifted kids in high school can study something that challenges them in college. Like in high school, in college you have to prioritize between your schoolwork and grades, mental health, and having fun. But in high school, you have demands from your parents and teachers, while in college, it\u2019s all on you.",

Literally one single google search regarding T20 acceptees' profiles will show you they had 1-3 activities and 1 that they really focused and expanded upon in their free time, often producing results far above a typical participant. Everyone knows that approaching college applications as if they are a checklist is widely known to be the wrong approach. I don't understand how on earth this is an unpopular opinion\u2014it's literally on the sidebar.",

All i want from college is the knowlegde about my desired subject (which i love to death) so that i can specialize later and get a job i will genuinely enjoy.

You want to be able to sit down with an interviewer and be able to talk to them as a peer. You also need to show you are serious about the profession and aren\u2019t just going for it because of the money or you dreamt about it since you were young.\n\nIt\u2019s important to take time off from school work to have a life, you will gain so much in confidence and understand your self a lot better. No one really cares if you are an expert piano player or were head of the debate team, they just want to see a competent adult.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t learn important skills like how to maintain a relationship, balancing friends with work, developing good social skills, understanding failure and humility, etc. your just gonna wind up one sad miserable adult.",

    "postText": "Six new schools-- Arizona State, George Washington, UC-Riverside, University of Miami, Notre Dame and the University of South Florida-- were invited to the Association of American Universities. [https://www.highereddive.com/news/research-university-group-aau-adds-six-members/651860/](https://www.highereddive.com/news/research-university-group-aau-adds-six-members/651860/) \n\nNow at 71 members, the association is considered prestigious and an indication of a high level of research at the school. (Interestingly enough, the Big Ten athletic conference puts a lot of stock in it when considering new schools since it wants to keep up its image on the academic side.) Almost all of the top public and private universities are members.

Membership doesn't match up exactly with the US News National University rankings, but you can be pretty confident any university on the list will be a solid legit choice for an undergrad education.",

For decades, UF and its minions in the legislature stifled any attempt at putting a medical college on FSU\u2019s campus, even to the point of granting one to USF, which isn\u2019t nearly prestigious. (FSU finally got that med school, but it relatively new.)They also saddled FSU with a school of engineering that it has to share with FAMU.",

High levels of total research at a university is mostly a thing that affects graduate school.  I don't think there is much of a correlation between total research output at a university and the quality of education at the undergraduate level.",

I hope this helps them rise in prestige and recognition, as I believe they're both great schools \n\nI'm national merit and I ultimately chose USF because they offer a full ride and I'm sick and tired of phoenix \ud83d\ude2d ASU barely gave me full tuition",

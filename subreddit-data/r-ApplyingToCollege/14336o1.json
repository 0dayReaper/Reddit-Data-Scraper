    "postText": "Hi I'm doing research with a professor over the summer and I have a few questions about putting this on my college applications next year\n\n1. How do colleges normally view research as an activity? \n2. What happens if I don't publish or finish by the time I'm applying? Should I still put it on? How will admissions view that? How will admissions fact check that I was actually doing work? (I think someone told me that professors that do research send their assistants names out but I just can't seem to think that that's true.)\n3. How do you write the description of it? Do I need to write my professors name in the description or just the college or what? \n\nThank you :D:D:D:D:D",

In other words, it's what you do and accomplish and also how doing research influenced your decision to pursue a certain subject or profession. For a high schooler, I think the most likely takeaway from doing research for a time period as short as one summer is learning what it's like to do research and maybe also picking up some basic lab / scientific thinking skills, which is fine. I'd try to ask your professor if you can get involved in making an intellectual contribution (no matter how small) to an ongoing project\n2. This is pretty normal. Progress in research is nonlinear, and oftentimes things won't work out or will take longer than expected to complete. If there's some kind of departmental or school poster session your professor knows about that you can present at, that'd be a good low-stakes opportunity. Either way, I'd put it on and also ask if your professor can write you a strong reference letter. I think that's probably the most bulletproof evidence for \"this person did in fact work for me and did their job well\"\n3. Put down your professor's name and the university he/she works at",

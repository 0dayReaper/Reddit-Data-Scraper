    "postText": "Current sophomore. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so fed up right now but I had my awards ceremony tonight and I was named in the top 20 of my class but I had soon come to find out that my gpa had been recalculated and is now a 4.3, I had my lowest gpa freshman year which was around a 4.2. I\u2019m going to finish my sophomore year with either a 4.396 or a 4.444. This will put my cumulative gpa at around a 4.3. I really had my eyes set on a top school and I found out that most people get in with 4.7s and crazy gpas. I know they aren\u2019t universal and many different scales are used but by the end of my junior year u should have like a 4.4ish. Is that considered competitive enough for t20 admissions. Realistically this and my awards will probably be my weakest part of my application unless something huge changes. Overall, Do I still have chances at top schools as a current sophomore with a 4.3 gpa and around 5-15 in a class of around 160 kids? I could also be completely delusional/paranoid right now, which I generally am, so I apologize if this comes off as snobby or just purely idiotic.",

Our school has about 125 students with a 4.4 - over 20% of the class. Because of out GPA methodology.  My daughter graduate with a 5.56.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I found out that most people get in with 4.7s\n\nWhere did you \"find\" this?  Princeton's CDS says the average admitted GPA is 3.93.  I've never seen a CDS say admitted students are anywhere near this number.",

Yeah, 4.4 isn\u2019t going to look as good as your classmates\u2019 4.7 but so long as you are proving that you\u2019re doing well in hard classes its not going to matter. \n\nAs for awards, you still have a full year to get more awards so I wouldn\u2019t count it out yet. Awards don\u2019t have to come from your school and there\u2019s plenty of places where you can get some accolades (my biggest awards came in JR year). Honestly though, ECs and essays will almost certainly outweigh awards unless you have crazy national/international ones.",

It removes aspects like alumni giving, class sizes etc - things that help Ivies and other private colleges. Of course, one doesn\u2019t know how much weight they will give to any factor and if it is material i.e cause change in existing rankings. US News doesn\u2019t usually shake rankings much year to year.",

            "comment": "An interesting point is that Columbia has different undergraduate schools and that one of them, the School of General Studies, would rank far lower on the USNWR if it were considered separately from Columbia College, which the University allocates most of its resources for undergraduates. GS is underfunded with minimal financial aid allocated to students while CC students are given great financial aid, lots of research opportunities and fellowships, as well as a larger alumni and donor network. Yes, GS students do get the same great faculty, unequivocally, but we have it far, far worse when it comes to funding and research opportunities. Depending on how much the USWNR weights funding for scholarships and research opportunities, but if GS were ranked separately from CC and SEAS it could be a good several dozen spots lower IMO.\n\nI think that the potential of the USWNR to consider the unequal distribution of financial resources to Columbia\u2019s different undergraduate schools has a precedent of sorts. Last year there was a lawsuit filed against the \u201c568 Cartel\u201d of top universities who claim that their use of need-blind admissions exempts them from antitrust laws, alleging that these universities actually price-fix their costs of attendance collectively to eliminate competition between one another. Anyway, in the lawsuit, there\u2019s a bit on page 28 that says \n\n*\u201dGeneral Studies recruits and enrolls a less wealthy, more socioeconomically diverse student body than Columbia\u2019s other undergraduate programs.40 The burden of supporting Columbia\u2019s preservation of prestige and financial accumulation therefore falls on those who can least afford it.\n135. Accordingly, in failing to conduct need-blind admissions as to applicants for the School of General Studies, Columbia does not qualify for the 568 Exemption.\u201d*\n\nThat mention there gave me hope that the inequality between Columbia\u2019s schools might be considered by the USWNR. It\u2019s a flimsy link, I know, but if Columbia was already in hot water with the USNWR then who\u2019s to say that the USWNR wouldn\u2019t go ahead and use data and evidence that represents the poorer quality student experience faced by GS students to lower Columbia\u2019s ranking even more?\n\nWishful thinking, I know.",

We get the same great faculty, unequivocally, but we have it far, far worse when it comes to funding and research opportunities. Depending on how much the USWNR weights funding for scholarships and research opportunities, but if GS were ranked separately from CC and SEAS it could be a good several dozen spots lower IMO.",

Small class sizes, things like the residential college system that foster community and school spirit, and top tier professors that are generally happy to be teaching young students.\n\nColumbia has none of those advantages. I mean, where do you want to start? The hideously incompetent administrative staff? The red tape, the bureaucracy, the stress culture? The professors who clearly don't care about the undergrads and the classes that felt like nothing special? The fact that there are nearly three times as many grad students on campus as there are undergrads due to Columbia's cash cow/pay-to-play masters programs? The lack of resources due to Columbia's smaller endowment and expensive location in NYC? You said you're a GS student, and you felt the difference in quality -- that kind of division shouldn't happen. A lot of CC/SEAS look down their noses at GS and Barnard students, and it's gross. You think a Yalie segregates themselves from other Yalies like that? No, and it all adds up to a deeply impersonal, toxic experience which explains the lack of school spirit. I'm sure some people love it, but I would not recommend it to a 17/18 year old who wants to look back with fondness at their college years.",

If something looks \"bad\" they see where they think that they can make adjustments.  \n\n\"We are different because -insert reason- therefore we need to take that into account and adjust.\"\n\nOther schools WILL outright say \"we can submit that, change it.\". Whether or not the person changes it depends on a lot of factors. I will say when I was told to \"change it\", I refused and left the institution a few months later.  Everything they did was shady including rankings. It was a dirty place.  \n\nSo yes, schools tweak the data based on their excuse.  There are places that will just change the number to be more aligned with an industry standard.  Actually I would argue that all colleges and universities fall into one category or another.  \n\nNOBODY is reporting straightforward numbers across the survey.  If there is anybody actually doing that, they are in a very small minority and probably wondering how on earth their peer institution is rated so highly above them when they know from industry conversation, inside benchmarking efforts, peer group meetings and conferences and all for those things the reality of certain numbers.",

Those were the moneymakers. \n\nSo they got rid of the news, stopped reporting on the world, and poured all their remaining resources into becoming a rankings operation.

Let's go point by point.\n\n&gt;overwhelming majority of Law and Med schools shit their pants when this years rankings dropped and rushed to have their data included\n\nThis is an enormous exaggeration. 1/3 of law schools left the ranking, including 12 of the T14. The majority of T20 medical schools left the rankings. Among those who left, ZERO have \"rushed\" to have their data included as you falsely claim.\n\n&gt;The rankings were delayed by a month to accommodate for late submissions by schools that previously refused to submit data.\n\nThis is again overtly false. If you just take one second to check the news, the rankings were delayed by a month over a \"methodology overhaul\" due to the boycott by law schools. A further delay was implemented April 11th as a result of concerns raised by law schools [as reported by Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/us-news-world-report-indefinitely-postpones-law-medical-school-rankings-amid-2023-04-20/), primarily due [to the inclusion of faulty data by US News.](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/law-schools-say-us-news-rankings-include-faulty-job-data-release-delayed-2023-04-17/)\n\nThe same can be seen on the medical school front, you falsely claim that medical school rushed to submit data when in fact [most of them doubled down on refusing to provide information](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/analysis/us-news-rankings-delayed-amid-controversy/). The delays were [as a result of INQUIRIES](https://poetsandquants.com/2023/04/14/u-s-news-delays-publication-of-rankings/), not schools desperately submitting information as reported by Poets&amp;Quants, with many of the schools being concerned about the methodology and calculation errors.",

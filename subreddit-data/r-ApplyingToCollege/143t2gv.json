    "postText": "hi,\n\ni'll be applying to colleges next year (cs at t20s) and had a question about whether or not I should have additional letter of recommendations when applying. I'm planning on getting a recommendation letter from my english teacher, math teacher, and counselor. Based on the relationships I have with my teachers and how ive performed, I know my english teacher will write a 10/10 letter (she loved me), math would write 5-6/10, and the counselor one would just be a basic template (nothing great, nothing bad). \n\nBesides school, I have interned at a non-profit in a developing country and a fintech startup. I can get a letter of recommendation from both places written by their respective CEOs. The non-profit rec letter would talk about what a great character and personality I have, my devotion to helping others, what significant impact I have made at the non-profit, and how I am top 1% of all interns at the non-profit. The fintech rec letter would talk about how I was selected into their 10% acceptance rate internship program, how i was a top intern, what significant impacts I have made on developing their app and platform, and how important my role was in this fintech (which has millions of dollars of vc funding).  \n\n\nto colleges, i would really like to send all 5 of these letter of recommendations, but online i have seen some conflicting things about this. i really want to add a letter of rec from one of my internships as they provide a perspective of me outside of the classroom. i can confidently say these will be 10/10 letter of recs and i dont think its something everyone has.\n\nSo outside of my teacher recs (im only going to send two if their require it, if they only need one i'll send my english one) and counselor rec, is it worth adding 1 (or maybe even 2?) additional recommendation letters from my internships?\n\nthank you and i really appreciate your help",

            "comment": "It is definitely good to add 1 or 2 additional recommendations in addition to those required, especially from places that will be important parts of your application (as I assume these internships will be). They will definitely make those extracurriculars stronger. And like you said, these LORs can set you apart from similar applicants.",

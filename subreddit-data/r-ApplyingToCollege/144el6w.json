    "postText": "I was lucky enough to get off the UVA waitlist the first week of May and decided to attend. Unfortunately, I am out of state and they did not give me any financial aid, however my fafsa and a2c do not tell my family\u2019s full picture. Two years ago, my father (sole income provider) was unemployed for half the year and made about 50k. During this time he took about 200k from his retirement fund (almost all of it) and his w2 makes it look like he made 250k. I am planning on submitting a reevaluation form and was wondering how likely they would be to understand and give us aid.",

            "comment": "You can ask for what is called a professional judgement from the financial aid office at your school. A professional judgement would allow a school to use whatever 12 month period they determine most accurately reflects your current financial situation on the FAFSA instead of the base tax year. You should be prepared to supply additional financial documentation to your school's fin aid office. Each school handles the process differently, so it's hard to give more definite information beyond that.",

I feel like there is an equal focus on academics, sports, and extracurricular activities, which is something that is worth noting. To gain a sense of the community and Riverhawk spirit, I highly recommend going to a hockey game at the Tsongas center. They're free for students, but anyone can attend if they purchase a ticket. I was a part of the biggest and most diverse graduating class, so I would have to say that the diversity there is my second favorite aspect of the school. Sure, there is room for improvement, but as of when I graduated, multiple countries were represented, there was a multicultural affairs office that was very active, and there were a good chunk of international students representing various countries.",

                    "comment": "Lowell is a very walkable city. There are a lot of local restaurants and bars in the downtown area. Having a lot of things to do can be quite limited if you live at the ICC (Inn and Conference Center) as a dorm. South campus can also be quiet, especially on weekends. I highly recommend living on East campus if having events to attend is a high priority on your list. If you have classes mainly on South Campus, however, which would be your FAHSS (Fine Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences) and Health Sciences including Nursing, or are a part of the Honors College, you might consider living on South Campus. Make an absolute note though that Sheehy Hall is going to be closed for this upcoming school year, so your only options on South campus would be either Riverview Suites which can be good if you're a health major because they have a HEALL LLC (Living Learning Community), or Concordia which is mainly hard to get singles and has very narrow hallways and a small elevator. And of course, it goes without saying, but if you walk around the downtown area, or anywhere in Lowell for that matter, it *is* a city, so be prepared for crime, the public health crisis of homelessness, etc. Overall, this is a long way of saying, your best experience would probably be living on East Campus, at least your freshman year to go to events and be able to walk comfortably. There are also a bunch of restaurants and some small shops over the bridge on North Campus.",

If you do happen to choose UMass Lowell and happen to live on South Campus, behind Riverview East Suites is a pizza place called Angelina's which is really popular. There is also an ice cream bar down the hill. I also forgot to mention that there is a gym located in Riverview Suites that any student is able to use, regardless if they live there or not. I hope all of this helped! Please do not hesitate to reach out with any more questions! :)",

You can also use the Grubhub app linked to your student ID to order it and pick it up in person in order to skip the line. To be honest, I lived off of dining dollars, and when those ran out, ordering from Uber Eats or Grubhub (which has a free student + subscription that makes most delivery free of charge.

It would also depend on other factors individual to you such as if you work a job in addition to studying, etc.). I have heard peers say that advisors generally advise against double majoring between colleges, and the reason why is because the requirements of each major often don't overlap. But I will cautiously say that it probably isn't impossible. If you do enroll at UML, you will have a SiS log in portal. If you log into that system, you will have access to something called a What-If report, where you can enter in both majors that you want to study, and it will generate a \"what-if\" report so that you can see if any of your requirements would overlap or if it would hypothetically take twice as long to complete your degree.",

I dont know much about the STEM opportunities at UMass Amherst, but I know that there a ton of opportunities for undergrads in STEM research at UMass Lowell. Multiple fellowships, work-studys, and co-ops that you can apply to. Make sure to connect with professors and mentors in that field early on to have a better chance of opportunities and recommendations that could lead to further opportunities. You can even get your name on a published study with select opportunities.",

                    "comment": "Of course! I'm glad I can be of help to prospective students! I honestly think at UML, it can be a mixed bag. I was not the partying type, not that there's anything wrong with that if you are. It just wasn't my particular experience. Because of that, I focused mainly on academics and sprinkled in some fun clubs and extracurricular activities when I could. I tried to only keep one or two focused on my major so that with the other activities I did, I was forced to branch out and meet others from different majors and backgrounds. BUT - Back to your question. I was in the Honors College and numerous honor societies, so I found my peers to be like-minded individuals. I think it just comes down to who you surround yourself with. It also can change depending on what year you are in. COVID either gave students that extra push to focus harder or had the opposite effect depending on what their circumstances were. The best place to study on South Campus if you're trying to be academically focused, in my opinion, is the Riverhawk Scholars Academy (RHSA) on the 3rd floor of O'Leary Library. You do not need to be a First Generation student; it is open for everyone to use, from the time the library opens (usually 7am) until the time the library closes (varies). \n\nI hope this helps and I'm sorry mu reply was delayed!\n\nTLDR: It depends.",

As far as my SAT/ACT scores go, my program (I originally entered as a political science major) didn't require SAT/ACT scores; it was optional. I was still able to do the Honors College (at the time; they now have a new Dean so things might have changed) with my GPA alone. A lesser known secret is if you don't get invited to the Honors College, you can apply to join anyways. There just isn't a guarantee you will be accepted. But you can try each semester anyways.",

The degree of competition in a field generally depends on factors like the demand for graduates, the program's reputation, and the number of applicants. Computer Science and Engineering are known for their high demand in the job market, leading to a large pool of applicants and increased competition for admission. On the other hand, Political Science may not be as fiercely competitive as these fields. Although Political Science offers diverse career paths, the demand for graduates may not be as high as that for computer science or engineering graduates, resulting in comparatively lower competition for admission. But for specific information regarding this, I would definitely reach out to admissions as they could help you better. In short, every incoming class is different in terms of stats and majors chosen, so it will vary. From what I can tell, engineering is very popular because UML offers so many renowned engineering programs. I would say it's similar to Comp Sci. I wouldn't personally recommend comparing two different colleges (FAHSS and Francis School of Engineering, in addition to the engineering focus \\[chemical, mechanical, etc.\\]) because they have different requirements and different applicant pools.\n\nWhile Computer Science and Engineering programs tend to be highly competitive at UMass Lowell, the level of competitiveness for Political Science may differ.

I toured UMass Dartmouth and UMass Lowell 5 times each before choosing UMass Lowell. In the end, it just felt right and I was filled with joy when I stepped foot into the admissions office to commit (I went in person to commit, which isn't required). It was a nice personal touch to have met the now Chancellor Emertus, Jacquie Maloney. She took the time to talk with me and my family. The cost (believe it or not; keep in mind that this was 4 yrs ago now, so tuition was lower) and academic ranks, plus the fact that I was able to meet professors in my department and get a feel of what a typical class would be like, solidified my decision for me. But it definitely is not this way for everyone. I was scared until the final five minutes before my decision that I wouldn't choose the right university. Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith and hope it works out (BUT if you are going to do this, make sure the credits transfer to somewhere else you are considering going! Get confirmation on this from BOTH schools!! This is super important!!).",

There's also Catholic Mass on Sunday if that's your scene. If not, there's plenty other multicultural groups and clubs on campus! Off campus, there are poetry slams held twice a month by the Untitled Open Mic Night group. I definitely recommend checking those out. There is also Mill No. 5, which is a bunch of small business niche type stores in a renovated Mill building which is really cool. I really like their Apothecary, where they offer homemade handcut soaps in every scent imaginable and loose tea.",

UML's creative writing concentration is special in the way that the curriculum is taught (only one other school in Vermont teaches the same way). We have big name, accomplished authors at UML. We have had Oprah, Meryl Streep, and Bill Nye visit, to name a few notable people. The food is definitely better than UMass Dartmouth but horrible compared to UMass Amherst. The creative writing program at UMass Boston (for an MFA) is only partially funded and accepts 10 students a year, whereas UML doesn't have an MFA program. I apologize as most of this answer is specific to the degree path I took.",

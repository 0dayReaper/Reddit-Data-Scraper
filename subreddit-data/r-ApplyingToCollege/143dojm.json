            "comment": "There are many summer programs involving biology that you could potentially find very rewarding.  I think some of the most obviously rewarding ones involve taking a regular university summer class in person, because that will give you a good preview of college life and academics, and may help refine your interests in biology beyond most HS students.  But because they involve actually university classes, they can be quite expensive.\n\nThere are also some university-based programs that do offer aid, although off hand it seemed to me those were mostly not the programs that involved taking regular summer classes.  Still, I think that the experience of going away to a university, mingling with HS students from all over, and such can likely be valuable.\n\nHowever, these are typically not \"prestigious\" in that they either do not have competitive admissions at all, or their admissions process is far less competitive than, say, the more competitive colleges.  Some people seem to suggest if the program is free or you get a scholarship, that might be \"more\" prestigious, but I've seen admissions officers suggest otherwise, because again even if those are somewhat more competitive opportunities, it still likely is not as competitive as college admissions.\n\nAnd some people seem to conclude from that you should do something else.  More realistically, almost no one does summer activities that actually materially enhance their admissions chances at their target/reach schools because of how \"prestigious\" they are.  Instead, summer activities fit into the application process by serving as an expression of your interests, and possibly generating material for essays and recommendations.\n\nSo, I actually don't think there is an inherent problem looking to spend a good chunk of your summer doing such a biology program.  Just understand it is an expression of your interests, and a potentially valuable experience in itself, but not a \"prestigious\" thing.",

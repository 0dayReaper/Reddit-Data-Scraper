The way I read your idea, you are focusing on #2 (e.g. \u2018let me show you how resilient I am\u2019). Furthermore there seems to be a danger of a lot of telling and not showing here. \n\nSome things I would be more interested in reading about are, how is it you come up with ideas for art and how do you execute; and what actually goes on in an art-related internship.",

That being said, you have very good points that I'll keep in mind while I explore the prompt/topic more. I like your idea about sharing the process behind working as a concept artist, too.

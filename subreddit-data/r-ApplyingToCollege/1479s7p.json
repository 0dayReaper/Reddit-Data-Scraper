    "postText": "My dad is not supportive at all of my desire to pursue a career in fashion and my mom does not support to me going out of state to attend fashion schools. It\u2019s so upsetting and frustrating. My dad wants me to choose the traditional majors like medicine, law, or STEM and doesn\u2019t care that I have no interest in it whatsoever and my mom while somewhat supportive of me pursuing a career doesn\u2019t approve of me attending a fashion school in NY bc it\u2019s too far away(literally a neighboring state to ours) and I might travel to another state(dk what that means). It\u2019s so surprising bc she actually suggested to me a school out of state and wanted me to research on it(But then again there are still times where she\u2019d push me into traditional majors like my dad). There aren\u2019t many good fashion schools in my state and there\u2019s only 1(my last choice) I like but the ones I really like are out of state. Plus me possibly schooling in NY would be a great idea bc I\u2019d have plenty of access to internship and career opportunities and meeting professionals who can help and advise me in my career. I\u2019m so worried bc I applications for upcoming seniors open in August and I\u2019ll need materials and money to apply which my parents most likely won\u2019t give. I also hate how they both use controlling language like \u201cyou\u2019re gonna go to this school\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re gonna major in this\u201d. While I know the fashion industry is extremely competitive and pursuing a career in that field will be far from easy I do not want to spend 4+ years of life studying at some school I hate for some major I hate and working the rest of my life at some job I hate and never had any passion for while also feeling bitter and resentful that I was pushed into this route despite \u201cmaking a lot of money\u201d. And honestly I would rather try to pursue a career in fashion and not succeed then go a different route and risk being resentful, miserable and bitter towards not only the profession but everyone around me who pushed me to pursue it while also wondering where my potential could\u2019ve taken me and where could I have gotten if I followed my dreams. I just want to be happy and not suffer any deep misery,regret or resentment towards myself or the ppl around me.",

Because that and a minor in fashion might be a solid option.(the minor doesn\u2019t even need to be declared until  sophomore or junior year). \nI have to say that my parents wouldn\u2019t support degrees in a range of (largely artistic and arts) fields - and as the people bankrolling my college I had to work within those boundaries.",

Unless you're heading to FIT and are amazing at making connections and already have some solid skills, you might find that debt load overwhelming someday. Especially if you end up paying rent after you graduate in an expensive city. This parent wants you to have a good look at that price point and at how industry-embedded programs you're looking at are.",

Yes debt would be overwhelming but I\u2019d be even more overwhelmed if I attended a school I don\u2019t like for a major I don\u2019t want just cuz my parents pushed me into it. Schooling in NY would open me up to SO MANY opportunities to build connections and develop my skills as well. Plus my mom literally had a conversation in our living room abt why she doesn\u2019t want me going to NY or any out of state school and she said it\u2019s cuz I\u2019d lie to her that I\u2019d be \u201csomewhere else other than NY\u201d or \u201ctravel to another state without her knowledge\u201d which makes no sense to me since I wouldn\u2019t do that and that could still happen even if I went to school in state.",

But you do have more issues here to work out than just finances - though those are an issue. $120,000 is a massive debt unless you're heading into a stable career with a high income. You also need to consider how you can demonstrate to your mother that you can be safe and responsible if you aren't physically near her. That's out of college help territory, though.",

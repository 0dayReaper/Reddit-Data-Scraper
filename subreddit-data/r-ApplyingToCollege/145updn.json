    "postText": "# If this post does not meet the sub's rules, feel free to take this down.\n\nCurrently studying in a country outside of the US. I moved away at an early age and studied in said country for a period of time and am about to finish 1 trimester at a college. I would like to take fully online classes for my degree from a college in the US as I currently dislike my disposition here in said country. I am utterly confused and have no idea as to how this all works. I have tried researching various admission requirements and the only college which somewhat fits my description marks me as a \"*Domestic Student with International Transcripts*\". However after looking at some of the admission requirements for other colleges/universities I fear I may not be able to meet some of them such as the SAT test requirements (I have not taken the SAT), upper/lower division courses for credit transfer (I am not sure as to what subjects count towards what), or even attending in-person for any sort of reason (I am currently unable to leave, hence the online classes). I would be grateful if someone could help me find an advisor of some kind who I can preferably email and talk to to better understand my current situation. My parents are not the richest people in the world and have told me to also look into something called FAFSA, but again I still have no idea how this system works. I can possibly send some of the required documents to a respective college but I'm not sure how I might apply to multiple different ones at the same time.\n\nP.S - If it helps I was born in California.\n\nThank you.",

    "postText": "I'm 16(M) in my second last year of highschool. I go to a relatively well-up Public School in Johannesburg South Africa. I have pretty good grades, 92% average, and I do 10 subjects. My 6 electives are Physics, IT, Biology, Geography, AP Maths ( IEB) and AP Physics ( Also IEB). The curriculum we follow is CAPS which is like an IEB knockoff, and I do 3 extra subjects.\n\nWith regards to extra-curriculars. I'm mostly on and off with sports, but I'm Captain of our schools debating team and hoping to make it to nationals next year. I'm also most likely to be a prefect in the school and I'm a member of a Charity similar to a rotary club that selects top grade 11-students from the province.\n\nThe point im trying to make is I am an excellent student by South African standards, but I'm not sure if I'll make admission into any Ivy League schools ( MIT being my dream). I'm hoping to take the SAT and ACT's by the end of the year, but other than that, do I really have a chance? Is there anything else I can do?",

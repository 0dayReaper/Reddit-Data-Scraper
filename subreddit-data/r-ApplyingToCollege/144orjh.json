    "postText": "I'm a rising senior finalizing my college list and I'm worried I made a bad list. I'd really appreciate any feedback-- schools I could add, remove, etc! I'm open to anything when it comes to schools. I'm looking to go to grad school so emphasis on research, internships, etc. is important to me.\n\nSome background: I'm a pretty mediocre student so I'm not aiming as high as a lot of people. I have to worry about cost (35k COA per year is my absolute max, paying OOS tuition everywhere but PA). I have a 3.2W GPA with an upward trend (1.9 GPA during 9th/COVID, 3.9W during 10th, 4.5W during 11th). 1410 SAT. Applying for CS (lol). I also have unremarkable ECs outside a research internship this summer.\n\nSo far I have \n\nReaches: RIT, Pitt, RPI, WPI, Rose-Hulman \n\nTargets: West Chester, Kutztown(these are relatively unheard of state schools), Penn State, Lewis and Clark\n\nI'm mainly worried about my lack of targets/safeties and how far my reaches are, but I'm struggling to find any colleges that fill these gaps. I don't feel like I'm a safety anywhere except Kutztown and maybe West Chester (96% AR and 89% AR respectively). Should I just shotgun a bunch of small and unselective state schools like Kutztown and West Chester to ensure I have some safety?\n\nI have considered community college but I can't really live with my parents or anything and most CCs don't have dorms.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! For context, I am currently a rising Junior planning on switching to a blended learning school which is half online and half in person. They will allow me to take up to 2 APs at the local highschool during this. However, I have been getting cold feet as I worry that the admission officers will hold it against me or it will weaken my chances in a sense. If I attend a traditional highschool, I can take more amounts of Honors and AP classes. The course selection at the other school is limited, but I planned on attending for my mental health. I don\u2019t want to jeopardize anything in what\u2019s considered the most vital time of highschool. Any advice or insight is appreciated. Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f",

So more APs/honors classes the better.\n\n2) For some people, they learn less well with online classes. While an online class may be more relaxing (fewer distractions, no transit time, don't have to deal with disruptive students), you might feel less connected to the teacher and the material. If you do well in online classes (meaning can learn the material well), then there's no issue.",

OP is choosing a path that will reduce their rigor. The reason might be important enough to make that trade-off, but only OP can make that determination. \n\nThis topic keeps coming up about telling the AOs some kind of extenuating circumstance for low GPA or less rigor. The AO can feel bad for you, but at the end of the day, the classes you took and the grades you got are what they are. There's no way for an AO to quantify the GPA/rigor effect of whatever your reason is for lower GPA/rigor.",

    "postText": "TL;DR at bottom. \n\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a46gxi/that_stanford_interview/?st=JPESTVPD&amp;sh=96d699ce) \n\nYesterday, I had my stanford interview. \n\nI arrived ahead of time and was just taking notes in my notebook, seems a small detail but it\u2019ll be used later on. \n\nWhen he came, I shook hands and he insisted we sat outside. It was freezing cold, but I obliged nonetheless. He asked quite naturally to just introduce myself and I did... but he just interrupted me and went \u201csorry, I didn\u2019t catch you. I just saw a beautiful girl. Could you repeat?\u201d. I kinda got an odd feeling from the off with this. \n\nHe asked me about what I do in IB, and I did so and explained my extended essay to him. He then proceeded to critically question it with various complex issues with the experiment I did for it (it was in physics, and he has a PhD in electrical engineering). He asked for the equation I derived, and obviously I can\u2019t remember so I told him it was a long formula but I can\u2019t quite remember. He responded by essentially telling me my experiment is quite simplistic, and it can\u2019t be that long and complex. Then flexed his thesis that derived an 11th order formula. \nFor reference, my extended essay was predicted an A. \n\nHe asked about my econ coursework for the IB as well, and we had a short debate about monetary policy of the Fed. However, when explaining my opinions to him using simple economic concepts, he simply told me I don\u2019t make sense. \n\nThis was about 10mins in. \n\nHe then proceeded to tell me \u201cyou spend your whole life studying. You won\u2019t succeed at Stanford, you will struggle massively.\u201d\n\nHe hadn\u2019t asked once about what I do outside of school or ANYTHING. Nor had he seen my resume or common app beforehand. Zilch. I am convinced in hindsight he made such a comment simply because I was so into our academic discussions as an Asian. I\u2019m convinced it was racial stereotyping. \n\nI refuted that claim, naturally. \nI explained all the things I do and he decimated each and every one. \n\nI run a funny podcast with friends for enjoyment. He ripped into it as \u201cit does not have a purpose\u201d despite me explaining we do it for the enjoyment and entertainment of content creation. \n\nI explained the two international honours I\u2019ve received. One of them was a 3rd place. He asked me why I didn\u2019t win, and when I gave my answer, he asked what the first place team\u2019s project was. He told me \u201cthat\u2019s actually innovative, all you\u2019ve done is manipulate a few numbers. \u201c. \nI explained my next one, and he said \u201cI\u2019m not interested in things you\u2019ve done for competitions\u201d.  \n\nHe asked me why stanford. I give a whole host of reasons ranging from the culture and how I clicked with students when I visited, all the way to specific societies and research groups that sound interesting to me. He told me \u201cthat\u2019s not quite good enough. You can find that entrepreneurial culture in any university.\u201d  He asked where I\u2019m applying other than Stanford, then told me \u201cyou don\u2019t make sense. these universities don\u2019t have any entrepreneurial culture at all\u201d. \n\nThe colleges I named? Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, USC, NYU (am applying to more but didn\u2019t want to rattle off a list of 10). He also insulted USC and NYU saying they\u2019re simply \u201cparty schools with average academics\u201d. \n\nThen he asked me what my \u201cthing\u201d is. I asked him to clarify what he meant, and he said \u201ceveryone has something they\u2019re amazing or world class at such as sport, drama or music. What about you?\u201d  \n\nNow I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not an Olympic athlete, a talented actor or a world class musician. I can\u2019t help that. I do what I do and have excelled at what I enjoy- and I enjoy a few areas. He called me \u201cuninteresting\u201d and told me \u201cyou will blend in with the 50,000 applicants, you\u2019re not differentiated. \u201c\n\nHe asked me about what I want to do when I\u2019m older. I told him I want to start a company.  He responded \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence you can do this. You have no evidence. You\u2019re 17,18, why haven\u2019t you built a successful company already?\u201d \n\nI have family responsibilities and don\u2019t even know which area I love most to start a company in. What does he expect from me?\nHe then told me \u201creal passion and evidence\u201d is like this example of a girl who did debating since she was 9. \n\nHe then asked about what drives me. I open up about what drives me... and he completely shut me down and told me it\u2019s \u201cnot really a motivation\u201d.\n\nHe questioned me on if I drink alcohol. Obviously I say no even though I do.... then he criticises me and says it\u2019s \u201cridiculous that You follow your parents wishes even when they\u2019re  not around\u201d. Eventually I break my guard and say I have the odd beer with friends. \n\nThen, he wrapped up the interview by telling me \u201cI know what I\u2019m saying is probably making your mind race at 100mph behind that superficial smile of yours but you have to drop that. \u201c in a serious tone. \nHe told me I \u201cdon\u2019t have a story, narrative or drive in life\u201d and to go and \u201cfind them and email it\u201d to him. \n\nHe said he would email me what he\u2019s going to report to stanford and \u201cnot to be disheartened by it\u201d. \n\nThen, as he\u2019s leaving he tells me \u201ctake your little notebook, reflect and sit there and take some notes on what I\u2019ve said. \u201c\n\nAs I said, in hindsight his comment about me spending my life studying was imo racially driven. In hindsight, I should\u2019ve respectfully terminated the interview there and then. \nHe had no right to make such a comment. \n\nI should\u2019ve been self aware of the situation, instead I was taken aback by his comment and too involved.\n\nAdvice: if an interview is going badly, be self aware. Don\u2019t take shit, even if you think your future is in their hands - because it really isn\u2019t. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d rather have taken the L there and then from Stanford (most likely happening anyway) than sit through and defend myself against a constant unfair, unwarranted bombardment of criticism. The tone he took with me was condescending at best. I was nothing but polite and sincere. Luckily, I\u2019m not too upset by this. Just pissed off. If it were someone sensitive, with the way he spoke, they could well have been in tears. \n\nTL;DR: Interviewer was a huge asshole and constantly criticised me. I believe he stereotyped the fact I\u2019m Asian  when he told me I \u201cspend my life studying\u201d and thus will \u201cstruggle at Stanford\u201d without knowing anything about me. Advice: don\u2019t take shit from interviewers. I should\u2019ve walked out there and then. \n\nEDIT: This lasted 2 hours. \n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone. I appreciate the support and amazing advice - even those that have been downvoted.\n\nEDIT: I am Male. \n\nEDIT: There will be an update post after decisions are released by December 15. \n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a46gxi/that_stanford_interview/?st=JPESTVPD&amp;sh=96d699ce) ",

We've received feedback here and there about alumni not asking good questions or long awkward pauses (which is just a matter of training/re-training) but most of the stuff I've seen or heard in my experience is fairly rare and benign. All alumni who participate in the program self-select, volunteer their time for free, and go through training to be in the program so the population is generally one that really wants to be part of the program and contribute in a positive way.",

What you experienced is absolutely inappropriate and I would recommend writing a lengthy letter to Stanford admissions describing your experience. They will definitely want to know that one of their interviewers is acting this way. Be sure to mention the \"beautiful girl\" line, specifically. That is wildly unprofessional.\n\nIf you want to take a strong, principled stand, state firmly in your letter that you are rescinding your application from Stanford and would appreciate a refund of the application fee due to this experience. \n\nIf you do not decide to rescind your application, writing this letter well is likely to increase your admission chances, honestly. I'm sorry to hear that you had such a horrible experience :(.\n\nedit: read some replies. I agree that the guy is just an asshole and probably not a racist. He's clearly the type that enjoys acting smarter than everyone in the room. For future interviews, though, do make sure that you can explain your research in great detail without notes. That is pretty important, for what it's worth. And although I personally disagree with the tactic, it's entirely possible that other interviews at your chosen schools will *feel* hostile and challenging. Part of what this is intended to tease out is the both the strength and grace of your intellectual spine. That said, this guy is about five steps beyond anything resembling a line.",

When you can't coherently describe your work, you're put in the \"pretender\" camp and it weighs very heavily on you, effectively removing your experience from the list of things that you have achieved. \n\nI've also been in interviews where the interviewers' primary jobs were to be aggressive and to make me doubt myself, even going so far as to pretend to be offended at things I'd said. It's not easy, but they are situations you have to learn to manage tactfully. It's a legitimate interview style. Probably not for HS kids though, so you can't excuse him for that. ",

Sometimes student researchers are just given a laundry list of things to do, a little background, and some suggested literature to read to get them going. Even as a master's student I can't explain the intricacies or every single goal of what I'm doing right now. Some things take a lot of experience and education to really articulate in a great manner.

If they claim they did the majority of the research, and are placed as the first author, then they need to be able to communicate their work. Too many students get onto publications because their parents are researchers, and I have to distinguish them from the students who actually know their shit. \n\nIf you're going to put bold claims about what your contribution was to the scientific work, then you should expect to be tested on it.

If it helps you, use the experience as fuel to show those types up. Use it as an example of what never to become regardless of how successful you are (or think you are). I doubt Stanford actually wants to associate with this guy, so I'd recommend reporting his behavior (especially the opening remarks) so they can rectify their ties with him.",

See it as a reflection of his massive insecurities and nothing else. \n\n\nPlease report him; not only because he\u2019s so full of himself, but because he has no right to say all this to a young applicant like you. Do this for all the people facing racing discrimination. \n\n",

I would say that if the interview went as you described, it is very abnormal and not representative at all of what Stanford has to offer. Now that I'm on the other side, I can recommend you some steps. Here's what I would do if I were you:\n\nStanford most likely uses their alumni network to do applicant interviews and there's a chair for the region where you interviewed. I would recommend you find someone who is a Stanford alum in your area, explain your situation and try to get the email address of the Alumni Interview Chair of your region. You should email the Chair, explain your situation as politely as possible, and ask if it's possible to arrange another interview with another alumni. \n\nUnfortunately, I think your chances of getting into Stanford will most likely be significantly diminished by this (if the interviewer gives you a low mark and you don't get another interview, your odds of getting in will drop dramatically), but it's certainly worth a shot and you may hit it off with another interviewer if given a chance. \n\nCheers, and best of luck.\n\nPS if you have any questions, you can pm me.",

She laughed at me and wondered what a 17 year old kid would know about any of that and thought I was just inflating my application. She recommended I go volenteer at a hospital as a candy striper. At first I thought she was just trying to provoke a response from me so I was polite but as she got more belittling I sort of lost my cool. Needless to say I didn't get in to Rice. ",

From what he said, it was obvious I wasn\u2019t really a good candidate for Stanford,\n\n(it seemed to me that people who get into Stanford, at least now, have already made something of themselves and would be successful without Stanford. I love the university I go to now and find it perfect for my personality and efforts)\n\nbut the way my interviewer talked about his life after graduation really instilled a sense of respect in him from me. He shared a story of how he struggled and \u201cfell off the horse\u201d so to speak. The only reason he got back into the job market was because some recruiter saw Stanford on his resume and figured he was pretty smart. He was incredibly humble and made a point to describe the motivation and effort of the most successful people he attended undergrad with. He was incredibly relatable and human- completely opposite of how your interviewer seems. I\u2019m sure my interviewer noticed some shortfalls in my explanations of why I wanted to go to Stanford, but he had the insight to understand why I thought it was worth a shot anyway and why I might not know exactly what I want to do with my life as a 17 year old. Much less how I\u2019m going to \u201cchange the world.\u201d \n\nYou seem like an incredibly strong person for withstanding this seemingly strong intellectual- who is the definition of a weak man. Your interviewer is weak because he fails to leave positive marks where he treads. Only the strongest people leave places better than when they came. I am certain you will grow from this experience and thrive in whichever path you choose to take next year. The fact that you even had research to defend means that you are making good progress in your scientific career. It was his loss that he did not realize you can grow from any of the shortfalls he perceived you had made. \n\nGo forth with motivation from this experience- that you can become both a well educated and successful person who maintains humility and graciousness towards all you meet. I wish this for both you and I. I\u2019m very excited for the progress I\u2019m sure you will make in whatever project you pursue. \n\nEdit: I just remembered: The last thing my interviewer told me was \u201cI\u2019m sure you will be successful wherever you go.\u201d\nI took it positively, and continue to work toward my life projects.",

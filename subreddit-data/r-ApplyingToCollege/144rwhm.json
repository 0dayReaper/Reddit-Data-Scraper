We were \"friends\" and she wrote some nasty things in it about me, and even bragged about the book to me. She wrote that she never considered me a friend, she thought i was annoying and fake, etc. (rich coming from her i must say).\n\nthis kinda negativity and hate is literally something you can only see in high school, and I'm so excited to get out of an environment that thinks that literally being toxic and bullying is funny and quirky. Now onto college where I can self select and make sure there are less awful people in my circle",

            "comment": "Yes people are shitty at college and in the real world, but it also has to do with the developmental stage people are at in high school and the environment which causes them to act this way.\n\nHigh school kids are insecure, but for good reason because they haven't really done anything outside of the controlled environment they are presented.  Plus they don't have any real agency over their lives.  Often they don't really have to truly deal with the consequences of their actions (ie I act like a dick to everyone I encounter, I might still get to go home to a nice life that someone else is paying for).  Plus their whole frame of reference is comparing themselves to this little bubble of their peers.  You may be the king of this little thing for now, but that's not going to last for ever, and in the grand scheme, you're basically nothing.    Also everyone is in a max state of youth and potential where everything is possible.  Life has a way of smacking you in the face hard and many high schoolers (hopefully) haven't dealt with that yet.\n\nLikely the girl with the burn book will look back on her behavior in 10+ years and cringe hard.  As an adult, that behavior would be completely insane.  However,  she might be dealing with something else that is making act this way, so leave some room for compassion.  Best thing you can do is learn from this and choose how much time and energy you want to invest in her knowing how she's acting now.  Another lesson for you is that friends will drift in and out of your life over time, and that is ok.",

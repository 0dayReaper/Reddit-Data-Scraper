    "postText": "Even though I am already in community college, I am posting here because one of the main problems is due to transferring and applying to a university.\n\nI am a community college student currently majoring in Biology. I have been interested in the natural and physical sciences since I was a child, and when I got to college, I naturally chose biology as my major. In school, biology was always the subject I excelled at and was most interested in, but now I am having second thoughts.\r  \n\r  \nWhen it comes to what I want to do after school with a biology degree, I have no idea. Biology still heavily interests me, but there\u2019s no field or career that jumps out at me. But there is with environmental science. Everything about environmental science interests me and so many jobs sound cool and important to me, I could actually see myself doing them.\r  \n\r  \nI am very interested in environmental science, but there are a few more cons with this major than my previous one. The biggest problem is the major itself. With a biology major at my community college, it guarantees me admission into any California State University after completing associate's degree level coursework to pursue a bachelor's degree. With environmental science, there is no guarantee. This is my main concern because most jobs that pay well and that interest me require a bachelor's degree. So I fear that switching my major won't allow me to transfer to a university and get a bachelor's degree instead of just an associate's degree from my community college.\r  \n\r  \nBoth biology and environmental science interest me, but I am worried about which one is more rewarding in the long run.",

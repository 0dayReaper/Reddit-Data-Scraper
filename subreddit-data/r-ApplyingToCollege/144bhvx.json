            "comment": "If you are referring to the common app personal statement, no one on this sub can tell you what you write, as it is called a \"personal\" statement for a reason. Think about things that make you unique as a person: it could be meaningful experiences/challenges that have shaped who you are today, a significant passion/interest, an eye-opening experience, or a particular community that you are apart of. The main goal with this essay is to be genuine; you want admissions officers to be able to get to know you with just a few hundred words.  \n\n\nI've found collegeessayguy to be a solid resource when it comes to writing your essays, but the topic has to be something unique and true to you.",

Apart from that, my strategy was to use a specific moment in my life to explain something universally applicable to me, ex: work ethic or integrity. Regardless of whether you use the a specific moment like I did, the key to an application essay is to communicate something about yourself without explicitly saying it, showing it through your words so that it\u2019s believable.",

    "postText": "In my sophomore year I had a drop in my grades. For context, I had straight A\u2019s as a freshman but then had 4 B+ in Sophomore year. However, in my junior year I raised my grades back up to pretty much straight A\u2019s again. The only real explanation I may have for the drop in grades was that it was the first year back in person and I found it hard to adapt. How can I explain all of this when I\u2019m applying to colleges?",

Also private schools tended to bring kids back way before public in my area.   Not that OP should explain this but it definitely did not impact each district the same.",

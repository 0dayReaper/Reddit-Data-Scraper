    "postText": "I have 2 days left of school I am currently a Junior in High School I messed up during quarantine freshman year I didn't do anything had straight F's and one D ended up with a 0.25 total GPA. During sophomore year I retook 3 classes freshman math, freshman science, and Intro to Business technology. Sophomore year was my turn around I got comfortable to do work. I ended sophomore year with a 2.14 GPA first semester and 3.29 GPA second semester. I got sent to a continuation school the first semester of my junior year and I did everything to return. Once I came back second semester I kept getting told by staffed that I messed up my education. It has me stressed, overthinking, feeling like such a loser. Currently I have 3.7 GPA this semester waiting for my finals to be graded. What should I do in order to go to college. I have one more year but I feel like no matter what I would do I wouldn't be able to get into a above average college.",

You can get a great education at a CC/4 Yr transfer, or perhaps a top 100-300 university.  FWIW, most of my state universities other than the flagship are in that range, and I think highly of them...they are great for second chances and people rebuilding their record like you.  Work hard and you will get a great education.",

            "comment": "Do your grades for continuation school count in your gpa? \n\nWhat state are you from? I ask so we can think about your community college options or possibly even your state public university options.\n\nYou need to get your cumulative unweighted gpa to a minimum of a 2.0 by the end of your senior year fall semester, which will be the final gpa you contribute before you apply to colleges/universities next year.\n\nWithout factoring in the continuation school, I estimate you currently have about a 1.926? \n\nIf you get just a 2.37 next semester you would end up with a cumulative 2.0. \n\nIf you match your most recent semester and get a 3.7, you will end up with a 2.22.\n\nIf you get a 4.0 next semester, you would end up with about a 2.27.\n\nAnd take the ACT and/or SAT. If you test any better than the average 2.2 student, which I think you will, the test score will help your application.\n\nThe good news is that you have shown impressive development of resilience, maturity and an amazing work ethic. You display concrete improvement every semester, and you look like you are trending in the right direction.\n\nJust do your best in the applications to acknowledge what happened. Don\u2019t make excuses, take ownership of your mistakes and vow to continue to be better.  Describe the process you went through after freshmen year, and how you decided that you wanted to do better, to be better. \n\nYou changed your methods and strategies, increased your effort and time spent devoted to studying, reduced distractions, and now you are a completely different student. This process has strengthened you, not weakened you. You know that the next time you fail at something, you will get up, work harder and succeed. In that sense you are far less of a risk as a matriculant than the kid bouncing between Fs and As over all 3.5 years of high school who hasn\u2019t yet figured out what you already have. \n\nIf you come across as mature, take ownership of your mistakes and show how you worked hard to overcome those mistakes you have a good chance of getting accepted somehere great.\n\nHonestly the worst case scenario is that you will go to a community college. If you work hard and do well, you can apply to transfer to a top notch university for years 3 &amp; 4.\n\nGood luck!",

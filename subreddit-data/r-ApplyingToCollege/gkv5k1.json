There were still submission issues on google chrome, but significantly less than on other browsers. Hope that helps anyone taking exams this coming week.",

Sorry I couldn\u2019t help you; I think doin research on this sort of thing is really important. I\u2019d say reach out to CB, but giving how they\u2019ve been handling the submission issues my instinct is that they won\u2019t give you more than the 98% submitted number that Trevor Packer tweeted.

For example, it would say something like \u201cThe torque can be expressed as___.\u201d You could imagine that his entire response would make no sense.\n\nAnother friends internet connection was gone for 5 minutes during the physics test, which, needless to say, is a significant amount of time. Although he submitted, he didn\u2019t finish, and needs to retake because he could have done better (but didn\u2019t due to technical issues).\n\nThe third friend tried to upload an image as a jpg or png or something, but, for some reason, it wouldn\u2019t accept the format (even though it said it would). So he had to convert his image to a different format and just before he could submit, time was up. He, of course, needs to retake as well, even though he was able to upload one photo.\n\nSo the number of people who just weren\u2019t able to submit is only part of a larger issue. Keep in Mind,  all of these were just for the physics C test.  College board is just bullshit man.",

The thing with IB exams is that a lot of them heavily rely on open ended responses (e.g. my History exam would have been all written responses and essays), so trying to do any of them online would have been a nightmare similar to this. But I'm not sure how reliable \"historical data\" will be in some cases, considering my school has only had IB for about 5 years now (I'm part of the 4th cohort). Not to mention the exams cost an arm and a leg too, and as expected IBO has been very... vague about whether or not we'll be refunded.",

We were pretty relieved that everything went according to plan in my household but it's frustrating that you guys have to be worried about that while taking the test.

Lo and behold, doing the opposite of what College Board said turned out to be the right thing to do.\n\nThese are my first AP tests ever and I never bothered with the SAT (ACT gang represent). I always thought College Board's incompetence/greed was exaggerated, but no, apparently a company with a monopoly on education is one of the dumbest organizations in existence. If the servers crashed from traffic or something like that happened, maybe I could understand. But how does something as basic and important as the SUBMIT BUTTON stop working??",

If they are just generic \u201cyes, I\u2019ll write one\u201d, at some point that needs to turn into an actual creation/submission.\n\nIf you request through the Common App, each teacher will fill out/submit their letter and then you will choose which one goes to which college(s).\n\nIf you request through something like MIT\u2019s specific application, each teacher to whom you send the request will submit directly to MIT.",

Importance of test scores range from important to doesn't matter depending on the college. The reason no one can say how much of an effect it would have is because you can't make statements that will be generally accurate.\n\nFor university of alabama, a strong GPA with a good test score + decent EC's will be extremely easy to get in.For MIT, a strong GPA and a good test score only act as a prerequisite because the vast majority of applicants already have those things. Your EC's and other parts of your app will play more of an important role there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo GPA is a thing that you must have as a baseline. Having a 2.5 ain't getting you into MIT. Having a 4.0 might not either. GPA can't be looked at in a vacuum",

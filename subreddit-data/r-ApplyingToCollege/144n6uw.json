    "postText": "Not many universities in this area to begin with, then not many offering spring classes for my major so I have to branch out. $60-$100 application fees. \"If you enter into our program you're going to have to travel to these different states for clinical (I'm in Nursing)\". \"Application closes in 2 weeks and you gotta take an extra exam beforehand!\" GOD. WHY THE STRESS.\n\nI withdrew from my CC classes due to mental health issues from being traumatized at the same clinical locations and am now transferring to a 4 year uni. But holy hell is this stressful. I'm considering only doing this for, like, 30 minutes a day it's that stressful.",

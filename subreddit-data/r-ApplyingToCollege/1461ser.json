The main reason im applying to this college is because I want to take care of her, should I write this on the \u201cwhy us?\u201d essay? Or should I ignore it and talk about the programs I like and things like that",

You could have a little section where you talk about how family is very important to you and how a \\*secondary\\* reason you want to attend that school is because your elderly grandmother lives nearby and will soon be without a caregiver, and you hope to fill in that gap.",

            "comment": "Seems to me like you are in a good position to explain it is both reasons motivating you.\n\nI note these schools are not necessarily interested in getting a bunch of boilerplate praise from largely ignorant HS students.  Nor, if you are doing a good job with the rest of your application, should they need this particular essay to get a good sense of your academic interests and abilities.  Rather, my understanding is this sort of essay tends to fit into their institutional goals more in terms of things like estimating yield, and maybe to get some additional insight into you as a person outside of academics.\n\nFrom that perspective, your personal motivation involving your grandmother is probably a more convincing answer than people who are basically just proving they can look up a department webpage.  Although I note even that distinguishes them from the applicants who can't be bothered to do that much . . . .\n\nAnyway, from this perspective you might see your goal as explaining why you specifically want to go to THIS school near your grandmother, as opposed to any others that might be nearby.  If you can do that in a convincing way, my guess is that will strike them as a \"good\" answer to this sort of question.",

Figure out \\*exactly\\* what you would need to do, on a daily basis, to help the grandparent. Weekly visits? Sure. Prepare most meals? No, that's likely too much.\n\nAlso consider that the college might wonder whether the responsibility, in this case, might interfere with your studies.",

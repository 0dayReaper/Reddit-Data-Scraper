    "postText": "this might be me just overthinking (or just a severe case of imposter syndrome) but ive started to doubt if my decision as to where to attend college was the right one.\n\na little backstory: i applied to 5 colleges, 4 of which were in-state (tx), and where i committed was largely dependent on financial aid/scholarships. i had already tossed 3 of these schools out when it came to deciding: TCU (not enough aid), Trinity University (just wasn't as interested), and Vanderbilt (rejected \ud83d\ude1c). it came down to two: Texas A&amp;M and Rice University.\n\nI was selected for two, fairly prestigious, last-dollar, full-ride scholarships to Texas A&amp;M, ultimately guaranteeing me 0 debt in getting my degree. Because of this, I was very set on attending TAMU until I got my Rice decision.\n\nI really did not think I would get accepted, like at all. Rice is my dream school, but I guess I had given up on it because I thought my application was subpar AND because I had no expectation of getting as much aid as I did (pretty much 95% cost of attendance.)\n\nUltimately, I committed to Rice, but have been having doubts, specifically regarding those scholarship programs. Because FAFSA rules are always changing, I'm just worried I won't be offered as much aid throughout the rest of my time at Rice. With those scholarships, I wouldn't have even needed to worry about it. I am a first-gen, low-income student majoring in neuroscience, and money was probably the largest factor in this process.\n\ni know i cant change anything now of course, just wandering if y'all had any input or advice into the whole situation. thanks :-D",

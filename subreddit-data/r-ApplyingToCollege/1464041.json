    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm a rising senior who is interested in applying to Upenn Early Decision. I am interested in business, and ultimately want to pursue finance, but am unsure if it is better to apply as an Econ major (CAS) or with a concentration in finance (Wharton School). I am not mega-hooked or anything like that (I don't think being female counts anymore haha), but I can write good personal essays that I know will play a role in the admissions process. My SAT breakdown is 780 M, 720 R, but I might retake it in august to get the math to 800. My extracurriculars are okay, such as involvement in business clubs at school, a personal research project, and an outside sport that requires a lot of commitment. My GPA does not really standout at my school, as it's very rigorous and competitive, but there is an upward trajectory from freshman year to junior year (think 3.5 to 3.9 UW). I am pretty set on finance, and my parents support my decision to apply to Penn ED; if anyone could provide insight into whether there is A) a better chance of getting into CAS as an Econ major or Wharton with a concentration in finance and B) whether prospects for each are vastly different, it would be much appreciated! Thank you!",

            "comment": "Major does not matter for job prospects in finance. All else equal, if you're a student at a target uni, it doesn't really matter whether you're CS, english, or econ. If you attend a target school, have a good GPA, and have an otherwise solid candidate profile, finance firms will interview you.\n\nObviously some roles care about your degree, say like quant where you do need the advanced mathematical skills, but your typical investment bank or PE firm doesn't really care about your major if you can pass the finance technical interviews.\n\nThe most important points for you to consider would be admission and resources. It would be advantageous to choose the easier program to be admitted into. Likewise, it would also be advantageous to choose the program that gives you access to the best resources and events.",

Also because most English majors won\u2019t be applying to finance\u2026 or they would've majored in it. Opportunities are pretty much equalized between business and econ, and at that point, you\u2019re looking at what resources and what the name brand recognition of Wharton will do for you over what UPenn itself has to offer.\n\nIt will obviously be superior, but it is not so large that it matters all that much. If you secure strong internships, have a great GPA, impactful leadership, network, etc. it won\u2019t matter. There is a reason why top firms do not list major requirements on their applications.",

No recruiter at a firm is going to care if you\u2019re finance or English if you have the same internship experience, same GPA, same leadership, same networking.\n\nEnglish majors do worse because most won\u2019t have the same internship experience a finance student will, mostly because they probably won\u2019t be pursuing finance or they wouldn\u2019t have majored in English. Anyone who wants finance at a school like UPenn can make it happen, regardless of your major.\n\nBut don\u2019t mind me, college sophomore. I guess I don\u2019t know anything, despite the fact that I help in campus recruiting for my firm lmao.",

If you ever end up there, which with this attitude seems pretty unlikely, one of them will surely be your boss one day.\n\nA college sophomore doesn\u2019t know anything about recruitment. You place far too much importance on major when the school in question is UPenn of all places. There are gifted people in all majors and the Ivy League sticker is a great equalizer.",

    "postText": "So I tried to calculate my class rank by using 100% - (m/k) = x, where m is my class rank, k is the total amount of students ranked, and x is the top percentage of the class that I am ranked in. I was ranked 96 out of 406 students, and need to figure out what percentage I\u2019m in. The formula I used was from google, and it gave me x = 0.76, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right.\n\nIf someone could advise me on what formula to use, it would really help. Sorry for all the mathy stuff, too.",

In your case this would mean you are top 24%.\n\nAdditionally, this is a case where you can estimate quite well. We know that 100/400=1/4=25%, and 96/406 is really close to 100/400 so we can estimate it to be close to 25%.\n\nHope this helps!",

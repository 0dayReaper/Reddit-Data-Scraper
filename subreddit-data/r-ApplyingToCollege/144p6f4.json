    "postText": "Hi! I have no idea how college works and I haven\u2019t gone to orientation, yet.\n\nMy question is if I should accept my federal aid loans. I\u2019m thinking about just declining because there\u2019s apparently fees that come with it even if you spend responsibly.\n\nBut what happens if I do accept? I read that you can \u201chold\u201d the money but what does that mean? \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do. And my parents are helping me pay for college and I\u2019m planning on working more in the summer to save up (I\u2019m the first one in my family to go) so I don\u2019t think I need the loans?\n\nPlease give any advice if possible!",

            "comment": "Along with the interest, federal loans have a fee just over 1% of the loan amount.\n\nIf they are subsidized loans (no interest until you finish school) I would take them for sure still - you could take the amount you would have paid, put it in a very safe interest earning option (like a CD, money market, or Treasury bond), and come out ahead.\n\nIf they aren't subsidized, it depends on whether you need them to afford school or not.  Go through your budget with your parents and consider things.  They are a relatively cheap option, but they aren't free.",

            "comment": "Federal Loans incur a small origination fee when they're released to your college. The subsidized loan doesn't incur any interest until after you graduate. Even the unsubsidized loans aren't incurring any interest right now but that could change soon. So take on the loan if the need it, but think about the amounts responsibility.",

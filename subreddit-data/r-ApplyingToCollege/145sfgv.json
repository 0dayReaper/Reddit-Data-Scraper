    "postText": "For the record I\u2019m not a student at any UC I\u2019m just using it as an example as it\u2019s a massive public university system. The question is what would happen if you were pursuing a major specific to your UC campus like Environmental Sociology but for whatever the reason you transfer to another UC. Would you be awarded the degree you were doing as I imagine certain courses at one UC would have an equal counterpart to another UC but if the major is specific to that UC then would you have to choose an overlapping major or what. Also related but what happens if you transferred to another UC like 3 years in and majored in something different like go from Political Science to Engineering would both go on your degree. Again not a student no intention to be one. I\u2019m just really curious because this University system is massive.",

            "comment": "While the UCs are all part of one system, they are each individual schools at the end of the day. If you\u2019re looking to transfer between UCs, just like transferring to any other schools, some classes will get you credit, and others won\u2019t, so you would have to watch out for the classes you would take.\n\n In the transfer application, you would apply with the major you are trying to get into. So, for example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re currently majoring in Environmental Sociology. In the application, you would state that your major is Environmental Sociology if that school has it, or something similar if the school doesn\u2019t have that major. \n\nIf I wanted to drastically change majors once/if you transfer from one UC to another, like political science to Engineering, to graduate and get your diploma, you would need to take all the required classes for engineering. Since it\u2019s a big major change, this will probably mean that you will need to spend additional years in order to get the engineering credit to graduate with an engineering degree. If you really were interested in engineering later on in your academic studies, you could always attempt to double major in both political science and engineering. While this will increase your workload by a lot, you would be able to get two degrees in about the same time as switching into the engineering degree after transferring.",

My UC school allowed double majors from any major outside of the school of informatics/computer science with a major in the school of ICS, so applied math + CS for example would be allowed there. There are restrictions on doubling within the school of ICS though, so like for example you weren\u2019t allowed to double major in data science + comp sci",

Sometimes you have to provide additional documentation like a college bulletin or class syllabus - I did this to get out of some basic writing requirements that I didn\u2019t want to repeat.",

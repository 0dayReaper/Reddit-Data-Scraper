Lmao, when I got rejected, I was sad that I used up so much time obsessing over it and I decided I didn't have enough incentive to do it for the rest of my schools. The school I got into in ED II, the most I barely even knew about its geographic location except for the state and city it was in.\n\nMark my words, the less excited you are the better, you may be in for a pleasant surprise at the end of it.",

I started researching about ED II, the day I got rejected ED and I waited 18 days so I could perfect the application and sent it on the last day. I knew some things about vandy already like the courses, etc. when I was researching back in august. Didn't try to apply till December tho",

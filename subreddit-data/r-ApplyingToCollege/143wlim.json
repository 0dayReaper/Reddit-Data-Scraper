    "postText": "New poster here, I have heard that colleges will ask you about your prospective major. But I've heard that my intended major, CS, is extremely competitive, hard to get into any good CS university. Given that I probably have even better coursework and ECs for math and physics, could I apply as a Math or Physics major and promptly switch to CS as soon as I get in? Would this help my chances? I get that this doesn't world for CMU specifically, but would it work for most others?",

Many colleges don't even admit by major and among those who do, many of them do not allow you to transfer into CS after admission because they know you kids try to pull this.\n\nFurthermore, just why? If CS is your interest and what you want to do, then apply CS. Be yourself. Don't try to try some fancy backdoor into CS because you want to go to a shiny school.",

            "comment": "Likely going to be a not so popular opinion on this sub but if you can craft an application for math/physics that is just as great as one for a major like cs, **and the school allows you to transfer into CS with no difficulties,** then I would personally do it.\n\nHowever, if a school admits by major for CS, then transferring into it after getting in will likely be just as difficult, if not outright impossible.\n\nSo check with every single school to see what their policies are. Some schools I can think of on the top of my head that admit by major for CS are:\n\nUmich (think from last years cycle)\n\nsome of the UC's\n\nUWPurdue\n\nUIUC\n\nUt-Austin\n\nprobably a few more but these are the ones i can think of",

If your coursework is better for math or physics then you\u2019ll avoid a common problem that most people who try to do this fall into: their EC\u2019s don\u2019t match their intended major. It\u2019s pretty obvious that a kid with all CS and no humanities extracurriculars applying to a school with  an intended English major is trying to pull a fast one and transfer into CS once accepted. As I said I think you\u2019d be fine though if you apply as a math or physics major and you truly have good EC\u2019s in those. \n\nNow your program is that at most schools where it\u2019s not outright IMPOSSIBLE, it\u2019s extremely difficult or just flat out annoying to transfer into CS if you didn\u2019t get in from the beginning for this exact reason. If you get in on transfer, you probably could\u2019ve gotten in to begin with. \n\nTldr you\u2019re better off not doing this",

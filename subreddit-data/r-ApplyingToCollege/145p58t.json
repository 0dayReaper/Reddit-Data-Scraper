    "postText": "Alright guys, so here's my situation.\n\nLong story short, I've been forced to withdraw from my top-5 high school (private) in Texas for next year, when l'Il be a senior. I got cheating a second time and I have to leave. Thing is my private school doesn't expel students, but makes us withdraw, so it isn't on my record.\nEssentially now I have three options:\n\n1. Attend public school in Malibu. We have a house there, however, the only positives I see here are that it\u2019s free, and I probably want to go to college in CA. \n\n2. Attend Milton Academy. I\u2019m totally for boarding school, but don\u2019t know about this place particularly. Not a huge fan of the Northeast, so\u2026 really unsure about this place. \n\n3. Go to Aiglon College (high school) in Switzerland. This is probably my favorite option. We have a nice ski chalet there close to the school, and it seems like a great place. It\u2019s certainly the most expensive option, but it seems awesome.  They also have a phenomenal skiing program/team I can be on!\n\nOverall, I'm an academically strong student with a 3.8-3.9 gpa (unweighted) and a 1500 SAT with many strong extracurriculars. Any advice and thoughts would be super helpful and appreciated!",

Since you\u2019ll be in-state, the tuition will be lower and you will have a better chance of getting in than as an out of state or international applicant. \n\nDo you want to experience the world and travel to a new place? It seems like you like the activities in Switzerland there. It could be a fun place to learn and enjoy your life, as well as build connections. I don\u2019t know your citizenship/residency, but at least in the U.S., applying to any state schools would be much harder. \n\nI don\u2019t think you can go wrong with either, but if you\u2019re aiming to apply and attend the UCs, I think Malibu might be the better option. Plus, I\u2019m sure you will find a lot of things to do in Malibu too!",

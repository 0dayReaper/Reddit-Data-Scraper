Honestly it's arguable if it's even Hindi when so much of it is regional languages.\n\nBut Hindi is a Hodgepodge of all these regional languages in North India, so they just accpect he's a Hindi writer.\n\nThat's really the case with many writers honestly.\n\nIndian poets who wrote in Urdu-Hindi mixture (sometimes even pure urdu) didn't become common for a while after Kabir. They became common around the time of Shah Jahan and Jahangir. Kabir was much before those guys. \n\nUrdu speaking people were around here for a long time but that became a part of Hindi only around the time of Akbar. And a it took a lot more time to get into poems and literature. \n\nDon't quote me on this. I could be missing a few details here. It's been almost an year and half since I last was in a Hindi class.",

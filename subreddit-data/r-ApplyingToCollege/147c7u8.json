    "postText": "Rising senior here. \n\nI moved to the US for my sophomore year. Even if I didn\u2019t have language issues (C1 Certified), my mental health has been deteriorating over the last 2 years, and I\u2019m reaching a breaking point. I\u2019ve tried everything socially speaking. And to make things worse, my current public school has been terrible, and their negligence has negatively affected my performance (quite literally). I feel the school has limited my capabilities. The thing is that there is a much better school nearby (public too, T400), which apparently has a more similar philosophy to my former school\u2019s (T15 in my homeland). Given that Senior year is Senior year, I was wondering how transferring could affect me at this time. Has anybody experienced moving at this point before? Is it worth it? To be honest I just want  something new. And also, I\u2019m in NHS. Would I be part of the other school\u2019s NHS? I appreciate any response",

It is not the high school's responsibility.\n\n\\- If the high school you are considering transferring to is more competitive academically, that does not sound like a wise move if you are unhappy with your academic performance at a less academically competitive high school.\n\n\\- Colleges do not care about NHS.",

    "postText": "Is there a way for me to leave the Paris school into New York? I was admitted into the steinhardt school of communication and information, but it says beginning in Paris. Is there a way for me to continue my studies at the school in New York City? My family is relying on me because I work, and I have a sick parent. Who do I talk to and is there a way to get out of this?\n\nOk update: I am a transfer student who applied via the common application for the fall 2023 semester. I found out I was admitted into the Steinhardt school of culture, human development, and education but the letter states \u201cit is my honor and privilege to share with you that you have been admitted to the Global Public Health: Media, Culture, and Communication program at the Steinhardt school of Culture, Education, and Human development beginning your studies at NYU Paris.\u201d\n\nAt the bottom it states \u201cYour application was considered for any and all NYU programs and campuses for which you requested considerations and your admission is only valid for the upcoming semester. Transfer students cannot defer their admission or enrollment\u201d \n\nWhat does this mean? Am I attending NYU Paris for just this Fall 2023 semester and then I go back to my current university to complete my bachelors?????? or am I studying abroad in NYU Paris and having the rest of my semesters in NY and graduate with an NYU undergrad degree? I called the global programs, Steinhardt, and transfer office and they all don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so confused. If anyone is in this situation and has this exact letter can you tell me what you know?",

The remaining 3 years will be spent in NY, but you can study abroad again if you wish. I knew someone that did 5 semesters in Florence because she loved it so much. (eta I just saw you are a transfer- ignore above, below is still relevant)\n\nIt is past commitment day so I doubt they will be able to switch you out. What I can say is that you don't HAVE to spend the whole year there. You can request to go to main campus ASAP (ETA and you will most likely be able to spend Spring semester in NYC). Reach out to the counselor responsible for you, it should be available in Albert or you can call and ask with your N number.\n\nNYU is pretty good with extenuating circumstances, but you must have checked off somewhere on your app that you were ok with being admitted to another campus other than NYC. They are within their rights to have you defer if there is no space on main campus.\n\nGood luck.",

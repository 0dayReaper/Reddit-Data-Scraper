    "postText": "One thing that has always confused me about college admission scattergrams is how I see people with say a 940 SAT and a 2.7 GPA get into schools like Norte Dame or CalTech. How did they get in? Are their essays exceptionally written? Do they pay full price? Do they have connections? I do not get it and was wondering if someone could explain that process",

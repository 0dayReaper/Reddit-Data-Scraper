When applying, one wants the reader to think \u201cthis student appears to be an excellent human who will undertake enthusiastically the opportunities our college has to offer.\u201d  A compelling or even lightly funny essay about realizing that one was experiencing depression, sought treatment, improved one\u2019s circumstances, and can\u2019t wait to experience all that Michigan has to offer might be a fine essay, particularly if the student has done well and been active in high school during one\u2019s junior year.  Similarly, writing about successfully undertaking treatment for depression and developing an interest in public health policy and/or mental health advocacy might also yield a good essay.  But most agree that only writing about mental illness without showing that the student is successfully being treated and is ready to enthusiastically embrace college leads to concerns about whether the student is ready for the transition to college and university life.",

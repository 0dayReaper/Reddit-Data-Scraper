    "postText": "Hi, I was accepted to both UVA and NUS. At UVA, i'm planning to do economics and change my major to commerce at the UVA McIntire school of commerce. At NUS, i'm planning to do economics and data science for all my years there. I'm excited to go to the US to experience new environments and cultures since I have been in Singapore most of my life but at the same time, NUS is more highly-ranked than UVA. So, I'm not sure whether to choose UVA or NUS. Finances don't matter. I don't have any specific plans of where I would like to work in the future. I'm fine with the US and Singapore, or anywhere else internationally. If you have any advice, please let me know! I greatly appreciate it :)",

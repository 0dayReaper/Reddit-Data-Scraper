            "comment": "\"Drink free apple cider and eat popcorn\" - HUH? How is that volunteering for anything?\n\nMy suggestion is to TOUCH GRASS. Get out and involved in your community. Do you know how many elder folks would just love to have someone to sit and chat with? To join them for a walk? How many veterans sit alone at the VA hospitals daily with no socialization? You may find it to be very rewarding.",

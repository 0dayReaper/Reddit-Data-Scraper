    "postText": "  \nWhat's the expectations on foreign language requirements?  \nSo far, I have 2 years of foreign language in Spanish, Spanish 1 and Spanish 2. That's 3 semesters of A's, except for a B in spanish 1 my freshman year. I was thinking to take Spanish 3 online through Silicon Valley High School, and that would be an easy A both semesters which I could get done really fast.  \nBut I'm unsure if I should take it because I don't think that it would be treated the same, as let's say taking Honors Spanish 3 through my school and getting an A both semesters there, I think that may garner me an advantage because I have a feeling colleges value actual classes in school more than they do online classes. Furthermore, from there I could be poised to take AP Spanish Senior year too. But the thing is, colleges like the UCs only allow a maximum of 8 semester honor classes to boost your GPA, so I don't think it would even matter whether I took spanish 3 online for an easy A or took honors in person at my school for the A, because I have already gotten more than just 8 semester honor classes.  \nFrom a foreign language perspective, and towards my GPA, would it be pretty much treated the same if I took Spanish 3 online and pushed Foreign Language requirements aside, or took Honors Spanish 3 in person and went on to take AP Spanish? Also, would only taking Honors Spanish 3 be good enough? Is it necessary to also take AP Spanish the following year?",

    "postText": "Hi, so there was an award ceremony at my school and I got the sage scholar award which is to go to Russell sage in New York and get baseline 16k off tuition. I was really excited abt it but the more I look into the school the more I hate about it, it doesn\u2019t have the biology program that I really want and the area doesn\u2019t look very safe but my parents are sooo excited abt it so I feel bad not liking it. Also important to mention that they are dependent on me getting scholarships because we truly do not make a lot and even with financial aid costs are unachievable. Living with one mom who is trying to find a new job and a dad who doesn\u2019t even live with us makes financial aid tricky. I just feel like I have worked so hard to settle on a college I really don\u2019t like but I do not want to jeopardize my families income so that I can enjoy college, so any advice??",

Here's a link if that means anything, but basically I stopped about a year ago just due to being busy but originally had thought it would be really interesting to include somewhere in my college app. It started mostly as curated clips, but then I moved into colorizing footage of old TV myself, which also bridged my like of science/technology and the arts. \n\n1. Is this something I should list on my application? I stopped, but did it fairly consistently for over a year? If I started back up again now and made a few more would that be something worth mentioning?\n\nThanks for your help!",

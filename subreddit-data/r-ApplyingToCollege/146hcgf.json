    "postText": "I got admitted to UVA rd and just got off UMich waitlist. Since 5th grade mich has been the dream for me. But after committing to UVA I started to love the school a lot. Now I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nMajor: Econ and stats, may apply for business but might do like data science stuff too \n\nThey will both cost the same. I\u2019ve lived in the cold my whole life so it kinda sucks but not an issue. Warm would be sick tho. \n\nI am a huge sports guy and want that big school sports and frat vibe. My sister also goes to mich and she loves it. \n\nWhat should I do?",

If you do not have time to do that given you just got off the WL, then I\u2019d agree with the other commenter about making a pros and cons list. The difference in education / quality / rankings is marginal between the two schools, and the atmospheres are pretty similar, so it\u2019s going to be hard to make a decision based on what school is \u201cbetter.\u201d",

The honors dorms on the lawn that they hyped up so much just looked small and cramped. I know that college dorms aren\u2019t supposed to be luxurious, but relative to other dorms I\u2019ve seen (Pitt, UMich, VT, CMU), they looked awful\n\nNot to mention, it was crazy expensive. Think net price was in the $70k range for OOS.",

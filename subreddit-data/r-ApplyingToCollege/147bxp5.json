I\u2019m filling out my job(s) as an ec\u2019s and I did 1 for 30 hrs a week for 3 weekdays plus weekends (5 days) then I worked both jobs for about two months now I do about 2 week days and 1 weekend (3 days) for like around 12 hrs a week as I was a shift lead at my old job and now i\u2019m just a regular employee at my new one. This is just really complicated for me any help would be appreciated. Also I worked the first from july 2022-jan 2023 then did november2023-present.",

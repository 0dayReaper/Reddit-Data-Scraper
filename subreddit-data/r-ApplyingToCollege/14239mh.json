    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a rising junior. I have EC\u2019s with good potential (started the debate team at my high school, in the process of starting a petition to force the local school board to hold a student election, two years of varsity swimming and water polo (I\u2019m quitting in the upcoming year though), section leader of competitive youth orchestra, etc.). However, I\u2019m realizing that my passion really lies in economics/finance sphere, and that doesn\u2019t seem to be reflected in my EC\u2019s. Does anyone have a good suggestion of good economics EC\u2019s I can take on?",

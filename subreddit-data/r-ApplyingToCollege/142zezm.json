    "postText": "Following Reddit\u2019s recent [changes to their API policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/), our subreddit will be joining [several others](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) in a subreddit-wide blackout in protest.\n\n# What\u2019s going on?\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced that they were raising the price to make calls to their API. No longer free, this change will kill every third party app on Reddit, including [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/), [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/), [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/), and [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/), among many others. These apps are often the preferred means of accessing our subreddit, as they have many quality-of-life features that the official app does not.\n\nEven users that do not use these apps may soon be affected, as this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.\n\nOn top of that, moderators often use these third party apps to use tools that the official app lacks. These changes hurt our ability to maintain this subreddit.\n\n# Why Should A2C Go Dark? \n\nMost of our demographic uses mobile devices. These third-party apps provide an invaluable service for browsing, posting, and moderating on the platform.\n\nAnd as a community composed predominantly of students, we represent a demographic that is increasingly important for the future of Reddit. Our engagement, values, and preferences will shape the trajectory of digital platforms like Reddit. Our protest isn't a reaction to a bad decision: it's a show of our power to shape the platform we use. Our participation could thus have a significant impact, as it represents the voice of a demographic that is vital for Reddit's continued relevance and growth.\n\n# What\u2019s the plan?\n\nOn June 12th, we will be going dark for 48 hours or longer. Our community will go private. We, in addition to the [several other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) going dark, are protesting these changes in the hopes of a reversal.\n\nFollowing the initial 48 hours after the blackout begins, if no sign of changes are clear we will use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\n# What can you do?\n\n**Complain**. Message the mods of [r/reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/), who are the admins of the site: message [/u/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/reddit/): submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/), such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n**Boycott** and spread the word. Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice. A good alternative to our subreddit is our official discord server, which can be joined through this link: [discord.gg/a2c](http://discord.gg/a2c).\n\n*Much of this post is adapted from the* [*post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/) *on* r/Save3rdPartyApps. *Thank you for reading through this post, we hope to help make a meaningful change on this platform.*",

    "postText": "I've seen a few posts about high school seniors taking out huge loans to pay for college. Like, as in 80k or more. I've also talked to a few people who are doing the same. I just don't understand why so many people, who are just starting their actual life, are incurring so many debts to invest in something that may not even pay off.\n\nNow, I am not trying to advocate for a college-free life, nor am I trying to advocate for a trade school. I myself am a high school senior - however, I got 'lucky' and got a merit-based full ride scholarship that also comes with a guaranteed job after college. I am only pointing that out to show that my perspective may be biased, and that it could be different if I had not gotten the scholarship.\n\nAnyways, I think that it's super predatory for FAFSA and private banks to give out huge student loans to people who have just graduated high school. And I don't mean like $20k-30k for a transfer degree. I mean like 80k+ in loans. Because a lot of high school graduates aren't entirely sure with what they want to do for their career. Not everyone who goes into computer science is cut out for computer science. Same with health care, etc.. So you could end up dropping out with the debts, getting a worthless degree, or switching majors (best case scenario).\n\nThen, you have to like, pay back the loans. I cannot imagine starting my life with 80k in loans that I have to pay back. Based on posts I've seen, it's incredibly tough to get your 'foot in the door'. That could mean going for months without a high-paying job post-graduation, which also means that you're not paying off your debts. A few days ago, I met a 40 year old man who's still paying off his student loans from 20 years ago. Granted, the same guy now has a really high paying job, but it took him decades to get to where he is.\n\nSo, what do y'all think about seniors taking out massive loans? Again, keep in mind that I have never taken out student loans due to me getting a full ride, so my perspective is likely biased. Although honestly, if I didn't get a full ride, I'd do a transfer degree.",

You can say $40K, $50K+ in debt, but those are just numbers on paper that don\u2019t look too bad. It\u2019s not until students start making payments, is when they understand the true value of those numbers on those sheets of paper.",

While a degree from MIT certainly looks better than a degree from a community college, I don\u2019t think that taking on so much debt justifies the prestige. Especially when public colleges offer nearly the same networking opportunities. University of Texas (a public school) has a direct pipeline to Silicon Valley, and Texas A&amp;M is one of the biggest recruiters for CIA and the US military.\n\nB) I also agree that a lot of people underestimate the sheer size of student loans. 50k doesn\u2019t seem like much until you try to pay it off. I feel that a lot of people going to expensive schools have never held a job before. After getting my first job and seeing how much work is required for a little bit of money, I now know for sure that I never want to take on debts.",

A middle class family won\u2019t necessarily qualify for financial aid, but a student could get merit scholarships to make college much more affordable.\n\nBut not all schools give merit aid and many of the most rejective schools give out little or none. So students apply hoping for the best and wind up admitted with no aid. \n\nThen they think they should do whatever it takes to get this degree because \u201cbrand name\u201c or \u201cI\u2019m going to make $200k when I graduate.\u201d  Most people also don\u2019t realize that the loans start to accrue interest while you\u2019re in school. So if you borrowed $80k, you might owe $92k by the time you graduate.\n\nThe best strategy is to look on each school\u2019s website for the Net Price Calculator. Fill in your data to get an idea of what your cost would be for that school. Also google the common data set for each school. Scroll through it until you see a stat for the percent of students who receive non-need based aid. If a high percentage get it, that school gives merit aid. \n\nYou also have a better chance of getting merit aid if your stats are above average for incoming freshmen. Students should have a strategy of applying to a variety of schools they could afford without crushing debt. Don\u2019t bother with unaffordable schools that don\u2019t give merit aid. \n\nA rule of thumb is not to take on more debt than the first year salary for your intended profession. \n\nMy advice is to avoid excessive debt like your life depends on it. I saw a post on social media from someone who had faithfully paid her loans for years, but because of the interest accrued, she now owes more than when she started.",

I met a 40 year old man who's still paying off his student debts because the interest accumulated, and he only recently got his career in place. The guy is now making over $100 an hour, but he's still paying off his student loans from more than 20 years ago.",

Undergrads without financial need and grad students can get unsubsidized loans and these do accrue interest while you are in school. You might not have to pay until after graduation, but the interest is just added to what you owe.\n\nI mentioned in my original comment students are advised not to borrow more than their expected first-year earnings.

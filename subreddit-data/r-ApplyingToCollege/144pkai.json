    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am a current Sophmore (class of 2025) who, due to mental health struggles, has a realtively poor GPA. I do not do a many ECs as the few I do, plus having therapy 3+ hours a week, takes up a lot of time. I am looking to get recruited for my sport (rowing, coxswain) but putting that aside, I would love advice on what else I can do. \n\nAlso, next year and senior year, I will be doing dual enrollment at my local community college. Around 18-20% of students in my district do it so it is not that uncommon. I am not expecting credits to roll over once I go to a 4 year college, nor am I going for an AA, this is mainly for my mental health and so I have more flexablity  for rowing. Any advice on people who have done this/thoughts on how these classes compare to APs please let me know. Next year, I will be taking one class at the high school, AP Research, and senior year I will only be at the community college. \n\nPosting stats/info below.\n\n**College List**\n\nIt is a pretty big list as of now, over 35 schools. Here are 3-5 safeties, reach, and matches that are like my top few in each.\n\n*Safeties*\n\nBarry University, Bucknell, Bryant University, Jacksonville, Rollins\n\n*Matches*\n\nSMU, Ithaca, Colby, Santa Clara, Stetson\n\n*Reaches*\n\nColumbia (note- this is mainly due to their joint degree program with the Jewish Theological Seminary),  Brown, Georgertown, Harvard\n\n**Background Info**\n\n*Major:* English with a creative writing concentration and/or marketing or communicatiuons with a minor in Jewish Studies\n\n*Demographics:* Jewish, LGBTQ+, white, upper-middle class\n\n*High School:* Top 20 public school in Washington state, would say pretty competive with a strong academic focus\n\n*Parents*: My mom went to UGA (no intrest) and my dad Jacksonville University\n\n**Stats**\n\n*GPA:* 3.58 UW as of January (when our first semester ends), will likely stay the same/drop a bit this semester\n\n*Tests:* ACT was between a 24-26 cummaltive when I took it in 7th grade, I do not have access to the score report. PSAT as of fall 10th grade: 1180 with reading/writing being a 660 and math 520\n\n*Classes 9th Grade - No APx offered to Freshman, took all honors avalible*  *per my math level:* Art 1, Health, English 9 Honors, Spanish 1, geomatry, biology (honors track), world religions, digital design, psych, world history 1\n\n*Classes 10th Grade:* Ceramics 1, AP seminar, English 10 Honors, Spanish 2, algebra 2 honors, AP world, Creative Writing\n\n**Awards**\n\nDuke TIP Scholar\n\nScholastic Arts and Writing Personal Essay and Memoir Regional Gold Key Recipient\n\nJohn Hopkins CTY Scholar  \n\n\n**ECs**\n\n*Rowing*\n\nI rowed for 3 years and switched to coxing this past fall. I am on a junior mens team and also work with a nationally competive masters team (adult women). No crazy/outstanding race results- but I am looking to get recruited for it- either a mens or women's team. I am already talking to 3-4 D3 schools, but cannot talk to D1 for another week. This takes up 20+ hours a week.\n\nC*ity's Youth Council*\n\nAbout 2 hours every 2 weeks, so call it an hour plus/minus a week. We help plan events that benefit \n\nhigh school and middle schoolers in our city, are a focus group for the city planners. I am not currently in a leadership role, but I was nominated last year and this year, elections are this upcoming week.\n\n*City's Library Board Youth Seat*\n\nSimilar to above. About 1-2 hours a month. Was recently appointed and do not know much about what my role will be yet, but I know the general goals of the board are to provide acessablity and make the library a better resource for all.\n\n*Jewish Student Union*\n\nWas created this year and am a founding member. We are currently working to change the curriculum around the Holocaust/Jewish history in our school, and working with admin to stop the increase in anti-Semitism at our school/in our community. In addition, we help out at a local Synnaguge. \n\n*School Newspaper*\n\nWas a staff writer last year and this year was both a staff writer and PR manager for the first half of the year. I stepped back from the club mid-year as I was struggling to balance everything, but am hoping to get back involved next school year.\n\n*Volunteer Hours*\n\nAs of this week I have 189.5 from 2021- Today. A mixture of work at a local Synnaguge, my city board/youth council work and spending the summer before my Freshman year as a camp counsler. Hoping to be at 350-375 by September of senior year.\n\n**Summer**\n\nLast summer I worked as a lifeguard at my local pool, rowed, and did a creative writing course at UWashigton Seattle. In addition I did a 4 day rowing camp at UW Seattle.\n\nThis summer, I applied at got accepted to the following, but am staying home to do an intensive therapy program as to avoid the issues I have had the past two years arising again. \n\nI am planning on doing a Jewish Studies research project though, with a plan to submit it to National History Day, and than contine to work on it and eventually submit it to The Concord Review. \n\nSummer 2023 Acceptances:\n\nBrandeis Genesis Program, Community Rowing Inc U19 Mens Summer Racing Team, USRowing Olympic Development Program: Youth Development Program\n\n**Other**\n\nI am a big writer and, in addition to the application essays, am planning on attaching a portfolio to any school that accepts supplemental material. I also have a poetry chapbook in the works that I would like to get published (traditional route) and hope to begin that process before college application season. I also am an avid reader and read over 100 books a year. I also am already planning on including some information about my mental health in the grade explanation section (don't know what it it called).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you made it this far, big thank you for reading and for any advice you may have!",

Shoot for something in that range I guess.\n\nFor the majority of schools not in the t20-30: definitely not a bad score at all. Not something I\u2019d submit to your reaches, but not bad for the other schools on your list.",

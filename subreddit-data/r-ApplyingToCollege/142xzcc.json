    "postText": "Hi guys, I am an upcoming senior in high school. I have a 1440 sat and a good GPA (4.0 unweighted and 4.6 weighted). I'm the captain of the soccer team, NHS, SGA, and all your other basic clubs. However, I started a company that raises money to help kids in my county who can not afford to play competitive sports, and it has been extremely successful. I belive that I have a pretty good application. I have started the dreadful essay-writing process, and I do not know what to write about. I am not an immigrant, I am not a minority, and I am a high-income white male with no culture and no shit to write about. Here are what I am thinking about writing about\n\n1. Irrational fear of bees (Trust I could make it work, lmao)\n2. Sports4Aid, the company I started (I would do this, but every single college writing supplement is about \"what did u do to help others\" or \"how did u make a change,\" so I feel like I would have to write about it there to and I would be repeating the same stuff over and over again) \n3. I am litterly always smiling so I could write about that for the identity essay and tie it into something funny\n\nPlease help, Thanks I appreciate it",

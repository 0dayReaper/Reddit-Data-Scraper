    "postText": "Hello, so just a bit about myself:\n\nI am an international student following the french cursus, and was wondering a few things about the applications to colombia:\n\nFirst, does the SAT being optional still applies to international students?Second, is there any other test like IELTS that i have to take?\n\nThe reason i am asking these is because i am mainly targetting european universities which does not require the SAT, rather the IELTS test, so taking the SAT has no real motive to me. Hence why i am asking about columbia since they went test optional recently.",

Might want to edit.\n\nMost US colleges went test optional due to covid test date cancellations back in 2020-21. Most have kept test optional policies due to the increase in applications that resulted.\n\nConsider the rule of thumb that acceptance rates for internationals at top US colleges tend to be around half the college's overall rate. Also consider that international grading systems can be a little more difficult to decipher and that a standardized test score may provide some comfort to admissions in making comparisons among students.\n\nFor required tests, see the section about international applicants on the college's admission website.",

And If you can't take the IELTS, there's always the Duolingo English test that is accepted but they usually ask for one English proficiency test. In some cases, SAT English can cover this requirements but research this first.",

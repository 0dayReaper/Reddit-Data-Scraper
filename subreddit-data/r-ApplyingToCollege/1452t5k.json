    "postText": "I'm lost on what I should be doing now. I already have a fairly good idea of what colleges I'll be applying to, I've got a solid SAT (1510), and I've started my college essays. I'm aiming for t20s, but I don't think my stats are up to their standard, 3.7 UW, 4.7-4.8 W (not ranked), 15 APs by the end of senior year. While 15 APs are what standout, its not much better than the rest of the people at my school who have a similar course load but are highly ranked. So I decided that maybe strengthening my ecs would be the best move but I'm not sure how. My Ecs rn are:\n\nKung Fu (6 yrs) + 1st and 2nd at state competition\n\nPublished an Ebook teaching high schoolers how to connect high school science with entrepreneurship strategies\n\nPart of an organization that raises money for charity\n\nVolleyball Coach for kids\n\nSeveral online business courses \n\nCommunity Service\n\nI want to apply for aerospace engineering but I don't have much of a science spike besides taking nearly every AP science my school has.\n\nI've seen people say to cold email professors asking to participate in research, and while I've tried that with no avail, I feel at this point it could be seen as doing it for college apps and not out of interest. So now I feel lost on how I can further improve my application because there isn't much cohesion with my ecs besides a little business and science. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated.\n\n(Also martial arts is not an option for ecs on the common app so what should I put instead)",

Everyone who\u2019s applying is super qualified, and ~95% get rejected anyway, especially if you\u2019re not an athletic recruit or legacy.\n\nSecond, it looks like you don\u2019t have any ECs related to your high school. Does your high school have any clubs you can join? Could you start a new club at your school?\n\nThird, what was your approach when emailing professors for research opportunities? What skills did you offer? Most students who do research end up on the side of analyzing data, so you should learn how to analyze data if you haven\u2019t already. This might mean teaching yourself Python.",

You also don't have the grades they're generally looking for.  You're probably not going to get into one of the T20, and somewhere like Purdue is probably a better fit to your interests than most of them anyway.",

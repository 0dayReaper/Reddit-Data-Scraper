    "postText": "Chinese Woman Undergraduate ALEVEL \nDS: Data Science \nCDAS: Computational Data Science \n\nI like CUHK\u2019s CDAS program, and I prefer a four-year university.\n\nLSE\u2019s data science is very good, and the location in London is good, but the major itself is on the side of stats, and is a three-year degree.\n\nThe research institute is likely to go to the US.\n\nMy health is not very stable, Hong Kong may be closer, but the probability of the relapse is low, so London is also acceptable.\n\nThank you very much for your comments!",

Before you go too deep your colleges and counselors stop you and force you to improve. I think that it's highly possible that there is a conspiracy to suppress the brain power of graduating seniors. Perhaps a \"full senoritis\" could endow us with powers and abilities we've only dreamed of, so I say to my fellow seniors, take this chance, don't do your work, ignore the naysayers, and fully excavate your potential.",

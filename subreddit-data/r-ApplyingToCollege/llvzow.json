Soy milk, on the other hand is more environmentally friendly than regular milk and actually has a point.

It\u2019s wayyyy harder, especially for Indian and Chinese students, since they\u2019re the most competitive pool, to get into US universities cause universities usually have like 100 spots for internationals.

I\u2019ve talked to my English teacher and chances are when school comes back, she\u2019ll give me a bunch of suggestions to rewrite my essay so I\u2019d have to start from scratch anyways. Still, writing now might give me experience, so idk if I should. Would it be better to work on supplementals or the main common app essay if I do decide to start writing?",

If you have any sort of commitments outside of school, you are going to get burnt out from writing essays while also keeping up with your duties. I\u2019d suggest writing your essays over the summer, getting feedback from people that know you well, and then showing your English teacher for their feedback. My biggest regret was not doing essays during the summer, so please don\u2019t be like me.",

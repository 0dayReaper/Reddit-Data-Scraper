    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising senior and was raised by my grandparents who were devout pagans and my grandmother sincerely believed that I was the reincarnation of her father, and designed my childhood around that, ie. Enrolling me only in activities that he was interested in, then she died when I was 14 and starting high school, and basically for the first time I got to try to figure out what I actually wanted to do as a person as I got the choices for the first time to sign up for my own activities, explore my own interests, and basically develop my own personality/ explore individuality, and I was thinking about tracking that journey.  Do y\u2019all think that this idea would be a decent essay, or would it raise any red flags to the AOs?",

The essay shouldn\u2019t be your entire life story. Be specific. Try to hone in on key moments or experiences throughout the journey.",

Because in the bigger picture, it isn't all that unusual for kids to be figuring out what they really like those early teen years.  \n\nSo I'd definitely think about making this very specific about YOU and what you bring to the table as an applicant.",

And then what did that pivotal changing point look like for you? (while acknowledging the fact that death is normal and sad and whatnot, so you don't accidentally claim that you're happy that she died even if good things came out of it). That I think will be the only tricky part for you to manage when writing the essay, but everything else should be smooth sailing in terms of articulating what makes you, you.",

In an 'overcoming adversity' essay, a good target is 1/3 about the adversity, 1/3 about how you overcame it, and 1/3 about what you learned in the process and/or who you have become. Too many students forget this and spend 500 of their 650 words on the problem phase",

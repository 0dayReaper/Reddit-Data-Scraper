    "postText": "I've been home schooled for most of my life, went to a private religious school for 9th grade, and went to a community college for 10th and 11th. I don't really have anyone to discuss colleges with, and it's very intimidating. I'm hoping to study applied math, but money is an issue. I have an unreasonably large family (shockingly), so despite my family having a solid income on paper there isn't that much to go around. I have a 4.2 WGPA and a 1580 (800 reading / 780 math) SAT score, and I've taken almost all the college sophomore level math classes offered at the community college, so I should have a pretty solid shot at merit scholarships I think?\n\nI'm not sure what I should be spending my time on at the moment. My only EC is being a member of the aforementioned religious school's tiny robotics club in 9th grade, and acting as a 'mentor' in it for 10th and 11th grade. Should I spend my summer trying to patch this up with volunteer work? Should I work on projects relevant to applied math?\n\nI'm just pretty lost in general, and I'm starting to feel the time pressure.\n\nThanks!",

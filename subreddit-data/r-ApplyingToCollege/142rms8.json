The questions are very straightforward and are basically written word-for-word in the actual passage. This is mainly because of the short time that you get compared to the SAT. Also, for the SAT, on average, I was finishing each section around 30-40 minutes before time was called. This is why I realized that I would be better suited for the ACT since I could easily adjust to the shorter time limits.",

The ACT is a lot more about Math than reading, and the \"reading\" passage for me just worked through a method I called \"priority questions.\" Below is the method for it:\n\n1. Read the intro blurb.\n2. Look for the questions that ask \"The usage of *word* in line 32 means \\_\\_\"\n3. Answer those questions\n4. Read topic sentences and organize questions by order",

You don't want to waste time due to misunderstanding a simple requirement, like imagining you have to do something when you don't.\n\nBe thorough. Read through all the majors' descriptions of themselves in the course catalog. You won't major in more than one or two of them, but pay the courtesy of reading each department's one- or two-page blurb. It will give you an idea of the breadth of things people are studying and teaching all around you at the university. When you encounter a fellow student, if you've read up on their major it'll give you a bit of a handle on what they're doing.",

                                    "comment": "I guess it depends on the nature of your measure.  A school like CalTech is going to be more or less 100% STEM degrees.  I think MIT is usually around 85%, CMU north of 60%, Stanford north of 50%.  So in that sense, maybe CMU is a bit closer to Stanford than MIT, and MIT a bit closer to CalTech than CMU.\n\nBut to me, what is more important is all those non-CalTech schools are not 100% STEM.  In other words, CMU may have over twice the non-STEM majors as MIT, but both have like infinity times the non-STEM majors as CalTech.\n\nAnd to me, once you are outside of the 100% STEM category, it becomes a matter of degree and not kind.\n\nBy the way, this is a fun tool to use for these purposes:\n\n[https://www.highereddatastories.com/2021/08/bachelors-degrees-awarded-2019-2020.html](https://www.highereddatastories.com/2021/08/bachelors-degrees-awarded-2019-2020.html)\n\nComparing MIT and CMU, it looks to me like most of the difference in overall percentages is driven by CMU students doing arts or business specifically, which makes sense.  Stanford in general has a thicker \"tail\" (meaning at least a substantial number of people in a lot more fields), and also seems relatively heavy in social sciences.\n\nAnd with CalTech, you can very much see the 100% STEM thing.\n\nAnyway, these are the underlying facts about these schools.  What labels you then apply doesn't really matter--indeed, in the end, each of these schools is a discrete individual, and lumping them together into broader categories is always going to be an imprecise exercise.",

Application readers see through these tactics and it comes across as disingenuous. \n\nDuring the pandemic, I volunteered virtually for Vote Save America leading up to the 2020 election. I wrote letters to constituents. There were also phone banking options available to call and text voters. I know there are still many opportunities right now to volunteer politically. \n\nYou may also consider volunteering at a local food bank. Especially if you are vaccinated, this is a great way to spend time, meet people, and give back to your community. \n\nI have a friend who has spent the year reading the newspaper to the blind. Her local library broadcasts people reading the daily news and it\u2019s helped her hone her voice over work, as an out of work musician and performer in the pandemic. \n\nThese are just some ideas. The possibilities are endless. Living a meaningful life isn\u2019t about taking short cuts. It\u2019s about doing something you actually care about that brings you (and possibly others) joy.",

One person might put that they volunteered and helped out with the food bank which is pretty nonspecific - exactly what did you do? How long? Another person might say that they spent 12 weeks doing x, y, and z specific things with H4H and helped build 2 houses for families in need or served 400 meals or whatever it is. There's an art to creating a resume and cover letter. You have to express your experience in the language they can understand and be specific. This meme kinda pokes fun at that process.",

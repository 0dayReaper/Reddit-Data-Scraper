US colleges understand that international students may have some differences in academic preparation.\n\nIf you are referring to top US schools, where acceptance rates for internationals tend to be around half the overall rate, having no sciences may hurt your application. You do have math, however. Admission to engineering is not impossible, but you may need to look at less-selective schools.",

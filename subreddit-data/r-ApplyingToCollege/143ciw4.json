    "postText": "so i'm from a relatively small, wealthy country in southeast asia, and a considerable amount of students here go on to US unis. but my question is whether international students need to do \"better\" for SAT/ACT than US students (to make us more competitive) and if so, how much \"better\" do we have to do? like 1500+? or is 1350+ sufficient to make a competitive application for an international student applying to T100 unis.",

            "comment": "your standardised testing scores need to be at par with admitted students at the schools you're aiming for. If a school takes kids with a 1410 SAT on average, you *won't* be expected to get a 1500+ on the SAT to get into that school. But yeah, if you're aiming for a T20, then you should be aiming for a 1500+. So really just look at the schools you're aiming for and go according to that, there's no real segregation when it comes to standardised testing for international vs domestic applicants.",

In college I only did ROTC, but if it helped as much as people thought you\u2019d see a lot more ROTC in ivys. Talked to a few schools and they said it doesn\u2019t help, you gotta get in on your own merit. we can chat if you have more questions. cheers.",

I don\u2019t understand why people in this sub would happily pay THOUSANDS of dollars to \u201cexperienced counselors\u201d but just because a person who just went through the admissions process is charging 50 bucks they get triggered. How exactly are prefroshes \u201cscamming\u201d people? You\u2019re 17! You should know if a product you\u2019re purchasing is worth it or not and if you believe there\u2019s value in their services then only you\u2019ll purchase them. Simple case of supply and demand. If the basis for being unethical is that one is not experienced enough, there\u2019s so many infinitely more unethical products in this world. This is a win-win for both parties. I personally believe this is just envy between people of the same age group.\n\nIncluding my previous comment on this topic\n&gt; Some people prefer to listen to reviews by college students who went through the process just now and some might not have thousands of dollars to afford private professional admission counselors but could afford to give 10 bucks to a sophomore who\u2019s willing to review their essays. Same stuff in all of the industries, you can\u2019t say being a consultant without experience is unethical because then how will you get the experience. If a person does know the appropriate amount of knowledge, why does their age matter?",

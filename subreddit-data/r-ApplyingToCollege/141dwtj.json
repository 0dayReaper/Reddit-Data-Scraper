            "comment": "In general, IELTS writing is the hardest section. I have students who get 8.0 and 9.0s from the other sections while getting 6.0 or 6.5 in writing all the time (5.0 is low). IELTS writing wants you to write in a very very specific way, and I bet most high school native speakers who are good writers probably couldn\u2019t consistently get 7.5 or without preparing.\n\nOn TOEFL, my students scores tend to be a little more consistent between sections. Maybe listening and speaking can be hard. Listening because, like IELTS writing, the scorers want very specific things. Speaking because it can be hard to speak over everyone in the test center. \n\nWith my students, they tend to get a slightly higher overall score on IELTS but if there\u2019s a minimum threshold for all the scores (7.0 or 25 in each section), my students tend to do a little better on TOEFL.",

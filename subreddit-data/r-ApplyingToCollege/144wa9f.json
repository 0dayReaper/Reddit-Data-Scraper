    "postText": "I feel so unaccomplished in myself and what i have done these past three years. I dont feel good about my application or my resume. tbh everything feels overwhelming and there is so much I have to do. I'm so close to just giving up on everything and I honestly feel so empty and demotivated to do anything. \n\nand since it is summer, I am suppose to have it together, work on my essays, do a bunch of extracurricular but i honestly feel like everything is falling apart. My courses junior year was a hot mess, my extracurriculars are not strong, and somehow every where i look, people are getting into such amazing schools and its sucks cuz i feel like i will never get to be like that. Now as i enter senior year, I not sure if I can even feel good and proud of myself or even enjoy my last year in HS.  I have been dealing with these stagnate and empty emotion, my lack of accomplishments and demotivation for the entirety of my junior year and I am trying to pick myself up and keep going. I try being mature about the whole college process and I keep telling myself that it does not matter where I go but how I make use of my resources and my time at college but it still sucks so much when everything is pushed down my throat about stats, applications, and colleges.",

            "comment": "A couple thoughts.\n\nFirst, you might be a good candidate for a gap year.  Sounds like you are kinda burning out and maybe could benefit from some time to reflect and recharge.  Just getting out of the same timeline as many of your peers could help, which leads me to . . . .\n\nSecond, it sounds to me like you are caught up comparing yourself to others, which can be a really exhausting and demoralizing habit, including because there are always plenty of people doing \"better\", particularly if you look for such people.  It is important fact about life in general that none of that really matters, what matters is you live a life that will lead to happiness and fulfillment given your own preferences and values.  And if other people do well with their lives too, that is great for them and takes nothing away from you.\n\nBut again, when you are involved in what to many feels like one big international \"rat race\", it can be hard to maintain perspective on what really matters.  So, maybe in your case a gap year would help you refocus on charting your own path, and not worrying about what others are doing.  And, in the end, hopefully you can ge clarity on why your path, whatever that may be, works for you, such that you can be excited about what should be a really interesting and rewarding phase of your life.",

            "comment": "College application season is simply not a great (very sucky) experience for many students.  It\u2019s extra work, decisions are released over a span of eight months, and during that (extremely long) time fellow students, parents, and teachers are constantly asking questions about where you are applying, what you want to do with your life, and where you got accepted.  All of which can feel stressful and judgmental, even if the questioner didn\u2019t mean it that way and was just making conversation.  \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that teen-focused media and echo-chambers like A2C give the impression that where you attend college determines your future when, for the most part, it simply determines where you study for the next four years.  Year after year, students who were initially unhappy with their admissions results post here to report having had an unexpectedly great experience at a university well outside the T25 that provided them with more than ample opportunities to impress employers and grad schools.  Some, like myself, intentionally chose a T100 over a T10, excited about a full-ride scholarship that leaves money for grad school and provides the traditional big school college experience. \n\nMy best advice is to focus on you and your life after high school, when college decision chatter will be well behind you.  Develop a college list that has targets and safeties that are genuinely appealing to you.  Consider factors beyond ranking that impact how you want to live during those four years: strength of your likely majors, location, size of school, research-focus or liberal arts focus, couldn\u2019t-care-less-about-sports culture or heading to the Sweet Sixteen mania, 100 clubs or 1000 clubs, big city life or quaint college town, weekends spent on bar crawls or on hiking trails, etc.  Try to start thinking about college as your future home and not a reflection of your self-worth.  And if you prefer a cute bungalow to a mega-mansion, that\u2019s a perfectly valid choice. \n\nAnd please realize that college is a fresh start. Many students who weren\u2019t terribly focused in high school shine when they find the right major or mentor, or simply realize that they truly need to begin working for the career they hope to pursue. And, yes, you are correct that for 98% of careers it is your effort that matters in college, not the college itself. (Insert standard exception for finance and investment banking folks.)  \n\nBut most important, realize that once you are in college, all of this insanity melts away.  College decision discussion dies. All of your classmates are attending the same college you do and the majority will love it.  You simply will no longer care whether your high school classmates are at Yale or UCLA; you\u2019ll be too busy enjoying your own classes, making new friends, exploring new interests, joining clubs, playing intramurals, doing research and projects, and forging relationships with favorite professors.  For many, college admissions and decisions are a terrible, awful, no-good, very bad time.  But, for most, college itself is pretty amazing.  Hang in there and very best of luck!",

It\u2019s extremely difficult to find a better school for an undergraduate degree - if you want a small interdisciplinary education with meaningful research opportunities. \n\nAlabama is also a fantastic school. It\u2019s a giant research campus with huge aerospace programs. Students there have a ton of opportunities, especially with NASA connections, but can very much get lost in the crowd. \n\nNeither is better or worse - they couldn\u2019t be more different.",

The drawbacks are obvious:  low F:M ratio, very small school (that can be good and bad), and it is in a very small Indiana town in a very rural location.  If you can handle that, then it is an option.  If that is too limiting for you, then the choice is obvious.  I'd be sure to visit first!",

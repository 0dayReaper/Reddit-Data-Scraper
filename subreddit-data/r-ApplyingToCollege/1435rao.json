For example, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne (top 5 in the nation for CS) does have a 50/50 split in their CS students in terms of gender, but they admitted around 10% of their female OOS applicants, while only admitting 2.8% of their male applicants OOS, and 40% of their CS students are Asian. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t nerdy schools out there that fit your requirements! WPI and RPI I\u2019ve seen here are great choices (RPI was quite expensive so I was unable to go sadly). Steven\u2019s was also cheaper in terms of price (Lowest out of all my OOS options, 24k a year after financial aid and scholarships) but I went with UF because as an in state student I got enough scholarships to go for free. A couple of state universities like the Univeristy of Maryland at College Park and UMass Amherst are quite top notch in their CS programs if you\u2019re looking for something competitive but not as insane as MIT (I couldn\u2019t afford to go lol, OOS tuition is hella expensive). Any decent institute of technology is probably a good choice for you too.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!",

I've never felt more like I've been a part of a community, and it is incredibly collaborative. It is very difficult academically, but there is no competition for seats in a major and you are actively encouraged to work with others on a lot of assignments because that's how things work in most jobs. If you have any questions feel free to DM me.\n\nFor other options - I'd definitely look at Colorado School of Mines, RPI, RIT, WPI, Olin, Harvey Mudd, GA Tech, and there's a lot of others too that have been mentioned in other comments.",

Definitely nerdy, definitely STEM-oriented, and many current students have told me that it's fairly collaborative and not nearly as competitive as some outsiders say, if at all, especially for non-premeds and even more so for engineering. However, I think engineering at any rigorous school will be collaborative because of the \"we're in this together\" attitude.\n\nAs for your other criteria, about 45:55 M:F ratio and arguably the best school in the US for undergrad research, which I'm sure helps with grad school admissions.\n\nThey have a few merit scholarships but it's super competitive.",

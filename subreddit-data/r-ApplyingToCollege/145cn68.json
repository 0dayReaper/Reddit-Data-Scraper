Many of the \"especially well-known for economics\" or \"especially well-known for math\" schools are likely to be reaches.  In identifying targets, you may want to consider giving some weight to things other than \"how well known is this school for {degree}.  For instance: cost, and \"do I like this school in general\", etc.\n\nWhat's hard is estimating how much higher your *specific* odds are of being admitted to a school with an otherwise low admit rate.  If we use the arbitrary rule that any school with an admit rate significantly south of 20% is a reach for *everyone*, then some ideas:\n\nPrivate: Boston College, Boston University, Rochester, Syracuse, Lehigh\n\nPublic: Michigan, UC San Diego, UT Austin, UW Madison, Illinois, Minnesota.\n\nDefinitely apply to Florida unless you're dead set against staying in-state.",

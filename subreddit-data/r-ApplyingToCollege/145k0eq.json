Something simple like first.last@gmail, adding a number if neeed to be unique.\n\nMore professional an also easier to manage by not mixing the, in with person emails.\n\nIf you are early in the process, yes, re-sign up at schools using this new address.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already had a long history of substantial communication with your school address, just keep using it. It\u2019s not a huge deal.",

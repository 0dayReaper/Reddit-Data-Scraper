    "postText": "So as I am composing my college list, I can't help but notice that most of the colleges are similar. In the sense that, all claim to help in the medical school process (Want to be a doctor), provide internships, research, a small student-to-teacher ratio, and more. What things should I gather to help me understand what school I want to go to? Would it be the campus, location, or?",

            "comment": "The normal answer is look at things like cost and type of campus, including on the theory happy people tend to do best in school.\n\nBut if you ask people who have gone through the med school application process any time remotely recently, they are nearly uniform in noting the overriding issue is getting really good grades.  And that implies at least a couple things.  One, don't necessarily choose a college you can barely scrape into.  Second, to the extent possible, try to identify where the other pre-med gunners are going, and then don't go there yourself.\n\nAgain, people in the know seem to agree that, say, going to a top college associated with a top medical school can be a really questionable idea, as it will then be you and a bunch of other pre-med gunners in the same \"weeder\" classes competing for the same top grades.  Going just to good Generic U. where the science classes might mostly just be people interested in science and not pre-med seems to be the much more standard recommendation.\n\nAnd finally, they will likely tell you to take on as little undergrad debt as possible.  Which, happily, tends to fit neatly with going to such a good Generic U., assuming you might count as very well qualified for that school, such that you are competitive for merit aid.",

Not my area ;)",

            "comment": "Hoenstly yeah most of the schools are really similar when they're at the same level, like there's probobly 500 diffrent random little lacs that are almost identical except for details like state, location, climate, exact major offerings and schoalrships, but the way the school operates and what's offered in general is very similar because the schools are similar. If you want to stay in one area that's the quickest way to narrow it down, next quickest is school size like, 2,000 total students vs 20,000 students is a very diffrent deal, anywhere with a graduation rate of 50% should be crossed off the list, weather the schools in the middle of nowhere or the city center or just outside the city could also be a factor to consider, maybe look at the weather in the area? Idk, if you need scholarships once you've narrowed it down a bit looking into the specific schoakrship offerings of the remaining schools can help narrow it down more, college navigator is helpful for researching this stuff highly recomend",

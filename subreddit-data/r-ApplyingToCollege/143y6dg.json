    "postText": "I\u2019ve been looking and 3-2 engineering programs lately and I\u2019m genuinely considering doing one. Is there anyone who has experience with these programs who would be willing to answer any questions or tell me about their experience? I have a few concerns but it honestly seems like a great way to get a balanced education (and acceptance into an ivy with 2 degrees) My first question is on all of the websites it says that admission into columbia or whatever ivy isn't garenteed  Does that me isn't garrenteed even if you get above the advertized gpa or isn't garenteed in general. Thanks for the info",

                    "comment": "Adding on this as a second perspective\u2013 I went to an LAC with a 3-2 program and though there isn't a guarantee, if you're in the top #-percentile of your class, your chance is pretty (very) high.   \nI honestly think that if you are a less competitive applicant by stats (if you are not worried about financial costs), EDing to a less selective LAC and then doing the 3-2 program and excelling in the program is a prime way to get the Ivy league title if you aren't thinking about getting a masters. Closest thing to a backdoor imo. \n\nThough, many of my friends who were thinking of the 3-2 program eventually just graduated normally since they realized the title wasn't as important to them by sophomore/junior year since they were doing engineering anyways and they were happy socially + academically",

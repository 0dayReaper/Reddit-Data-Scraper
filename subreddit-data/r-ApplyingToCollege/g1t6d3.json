The university has a primary logo which includes the M and then \"University of Michigan\" or \"M Public Health\".  The solo M is pretty much only used in athletics.  [But there is a huge history behind the M and Michigan's branding](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/statement/branding-blue-athletics-academics-history-block-m) and they made the branding uniform in 2013.  Kinda cool to read through different universities' branding guidelines.",

    "postText": "# Coming This Wednesday\n## Rules\nThe r/ApplyingToCollege subreddit is currently indefinitely restricted, meaning Shitpost Wednesdays are not possible. Due to Discord's rules, we've had to due a bit of family-friendly rebranding. We are now proud to introduce you all to our first-ever **Whitpost Sednesday**! Here's how it'll work:\n\nWe will open this channel at approximately 12AM EST until 12AM EST the next day. To prevent spam, you will be able to post **one meme every hour**. For everyone else, you may vote on a meme by reacting to it with a \ud83d\udc46 or \ud83d\udc47 emoji. **Any other reaction will not count.** You may also comment on any memes you like by creating a thread on them. Hold down on the meme on mobile or right click the meme on desktop to do so.\n\nAny memes sent in this channel must follow our server rules. These rules can be found in the channel #\ud83d\udcdc-rules-and-info. **Rule breaking memes will receive infractions.**\n\nIn honor of our first Whitpost Sednesday, the meme with the highest *net* up reactions will receive **one month of Discord nitro or a $10 Amazon gift card** (your choice)! We may do more Whitpost Sednesdays depending on how popular this is, but the prize may differ because we\u2019re not made of money.\n\nWe understand the closure of the subreddit has been rough on many of you, and hope this will be a fun way for us all to get through it together!\n\n# FAQ\n\n**What\u2019s happening right now?**\nCheck out our [pinned announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/14880u9/update_applyingtocollege_is_restricted_in_protest). In sum, our subreddit is **indefinitely restricted until Reddit reverses it\u2019s third-party-app-killing policy changes. \n\n**How do I join the Discord?**\nClick this [link](https://discord.gg/a2c)!",

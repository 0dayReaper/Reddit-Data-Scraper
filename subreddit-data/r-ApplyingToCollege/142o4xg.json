There\u2019s nothing you apply \u201cfor\u201d. \u201cFAFSA\u201d does not award aid.\n\nApplying this fall or attending this fall?  If attending this Fall, your FAFSA will still be processed/calculated until June 30, but the majority of schools required the results long ago, in parallel with the application process, to make an aid offer.\n\nIf applying this Fall, for 2024 start, you need to complete the 2024-2025 version, which should be available \\~October 1, and complete aid application forms at the schools to which you are applying.",

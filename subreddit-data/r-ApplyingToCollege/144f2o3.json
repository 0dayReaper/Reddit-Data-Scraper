    "postText": "I'm an international student who spent my last 3 years of HS (soph-senior) in the US. I have a 5.4 W GPA; I would say good extracurriculars  (I interned at a company, had leadership roles, and went to business camps in the summer), and I also play sports and speak 3 languages. I feel overwhelmed with all the colleges and their low-ass (excuse the language) acceptance rates, so a sort of summary or list of reaches, matches, and stuff like that would be amazing.",

Harvard, Stanford, and others don\u2019t have business, but have econ. The students there who plan on pursuing business careers just do econ and receive the same opportunities. So for all of the schools that have business, apply there. If they don\u2019t, apply econ. Same outcomes.",

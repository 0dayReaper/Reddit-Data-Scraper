    "postText": "I got sent a brochure in the mail from a state halfway across the U.S. (Utah) about a university, nowhere near where I live and wanted to know what I should do. I'm wanting to go into coding and computer science and this school is 100% that. A few colleges around my state near me offer coding but none of them I find as exciting and intriguing as this University. I'm not sure whether to look at other colleges or universities first or go to this one after I graduate.",

            "comment": "Colleges send these brochures in order to entice you into applying and do not guarantee admission. When creating your college application list, I\u2019d advise you to think about what you want from a school and what place you\u2019d want to live in. I applied to schools all over the US and ended up committing to one on the other side of the country completely! You never know what school you\u2019d like, but if it\u2019s interesting to you, you should definitely look into it more and apply there!",

Have a look on line and in Naviance or Niche, check out the net price calculator and admissions stats (compare to your own).  If you still are interested, look into their reddit and social media and virtual tours, see their courses catalog, look at their housing.  If it is still interesting, go visit.",

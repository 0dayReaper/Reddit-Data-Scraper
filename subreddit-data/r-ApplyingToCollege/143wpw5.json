    "postText": "the title. my mom is making me do this stupid zoom based webinar. its literally one person making a presentation for two hours and answering the most asinine prestige whoring materialistic questions of all time. its usually boring or infuriating. source: ive seen a lot of webinars.\n\nand besides its not exactly going to be the deepest topic out there. mfs out here revealing the informa tion \"hey guys to go to xyz college write good essays. take aps. do projects. be a nice person. do xyz famous contest ie usamo usaco.\" like dawg youre getting paid/volunteering to say this?? do you find this fun?? what are you even getting out of this?? source: experience\n\nfinally: i am fourteen years old. i aint even in high school yet. what the fuck. actually id bet 90 per cent of the people attending these webinars are parents or kindergarteners. maybe elementary schoolers. out of the students who are attending, 50 percent have been deceived to believe that college is the beall endall of life. the other fifty percent dont wanna be there. having to be with people even virtually who are this kinda obsessed makes me feel kinda nauseous\n\nrant over\n\nsorry if im calling anyone out. its a rant. dont take it that seriously, but please remember that a lot of people really would like you not to present your amazing story of going to such and such college. some people wanna enjoy their middle/elementary school life. i already failed at that so please dont ruin it for other people",

    "postText": "I\u2019m taking an academic full year class my senior year. The first semester was going pretty well, with my average grade coming to an A-. The second semester, however, is where it got worse. There was this huge project that was worth 40% of the grade for marking period 3 and 60% of the grade for marking period 4. Overall coming to about 50% of the total grade for semester 2. Not going to make an excuse, didn\u2019t complete the project, it was too long and I didn\u2019t have enough time. Because of that my average grade for semester 2 ends at around a 40%, bringing my final grade to a D+/C-. The rest of the grades have been fine, some jumped from A- to B+ 4th marking period but basically on the same level as I have been. Is it possible my college will take back their acceptance letter?",

I'd start by talking to your high school college counselor (if they aren't drunk on a beach right now) and working from there. You may be asked to explain what happened, so start preparing for that. No one on A2C can answer for your college.",

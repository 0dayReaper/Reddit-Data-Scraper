I really struggled 2nd semester and my mental health just sort of spiraled. I am planning on applying to some Ivies and T20s and was wondering if this will affect my application significantly.",

That is not to say that it will be impossible to get into, but you will need very strong extracurriculars, essays, and test scores to get outweigh the low grade.",

    "postText": "I already mostly know what reach schools I want to apply to (UCLA, UCB, USC, Stanford, UCSD, UCSB, UCI, Cal Poly SLO) but due to financial issues I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend college unless I got a full tuition scholarship/REALLY good aid from whatever school I go to, so I\u2019m leaning towards trying to get good aid from a small safety school or somehow getting something from a match school. \n\nDon\u2019t know yet what I plan on majoring in but thinking environmental engineering or business most likely. \n\nI don\u2019t want to go to a super small college (not &lt;5,000 undergrad) but not super packed either (like UCB) and want to avoid religious schools/PWIs too (more left leaning schools preferably), but want to try to stay in CA and hopefully go down south? Looking for a good, friendly &amp; active campus culture &amp; most importantly great job/internship/research opportunities but probably can\u2019t be too picky about this kind of stuff. Visited the cal poly slo campus and LOVED the summer vibe, the not city life but still things to do, friendly atmosphere, gorgeous architecture. Visited SJSU and disliked how close it was to SJ and the way the cities looked\u2014 don\u2019t mind if the college is in a city but prefer a little bit of separation\n\nGPA: weighted 4.7, unweighted 4.0\n\nSAT: 1430 (will retake) 760 R/W 670 M/S\n\nACT: 33\n\nAPS: WHAP (5), APUSH, AP Lang, APES (self studied), and will take APGov, AP Calc AB, AP Lit, and AP Bio or AP Physics C this year (school doesn\u2019t offer a lot of APs so also a lot of honors classes)\n\nConcurrent Enrollment: five classes so far but planning on taking one each semester (including 2 summer ones rn) so will be 7 ish once I\u2019m done with the application. All A\u2019s except for one B in a spanish class i took first semester of freshmen year (school doesn\u2019t offer a dual enrollment program)\n\nSchool ECs: ASB (frosh/soph), yearbook (all years, editor in chief/assistant editor in chief), Environmental Club (president last year and this year), ambassador team (junior+). NHS (soph year+), CSF (all years), highest honors from my school every semester. Very small school so no ranking but I got an award for having the strongest GPA of all applicants so I think I\u2019m likely in the top 3 of my grade (don\u2019t know if I should put on app), varsity swim (soph+), got selected for girls state\n\nOutside ECs: city youth committee for recycling (this year), won several local poetry competitions (Soph+), youth committee for local indian youth (this year), volunteering (maybe about 30 hours ish, starting soph year), internship at an online student run nonprofit summer/fall of junior year, taekwondo classes for 3 years ish (don\u2019t think I\u2019ll put on app)\n\nI\u2019m a first gen indian-american student from an middle/upper middle class family ish, going to a small private school",

    "postText": "I got into northeastern a few months ago and was planning to go there but the other day I got off the ucsb waitlist. I feel both schools have their pros and cons but i think I shld go to Santa Barbara. \nIf I go to northeastern I have to go to rome my first semester, which could be a either a good thing or a bad thing the way you look at it. \nI feel ucsb has a better reputation and def better campus life. But northeastern has the co op which I feel makes you very employable (96 percent of grads find jobs a year after leaving)\nNortheastern has a very untraditional college experience, but at the same time the party scene at Santa Barbara could be distracting.\nI feel they are both academically similar, which makes me lean towards Santa Barbara because it is way cheaper.",

If you are in-state for UCSB and full pay at Northeastern though, it seems like that would make the decision pretty easy. UCSB is an amazing school with a great college town and welcoming/laid back student body. Everyone I know who goes there LOVES it! Plus the academics are top notch.",

Oh yeah, and it's a top-notch education at a cheaper price. It's a no-brainer. Go Gauchos \ud83d\ude03",

And you can adjust your schedule accordingly to still graduate on time.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, NEU might hold your hand through the process - which is awesome - but it's up to you if you think it's worth the extra $X,000 (+ interest if you're taking out a loan).",

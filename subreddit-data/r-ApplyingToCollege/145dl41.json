    "postText": "Hey Guys,\n\nI recently applied to Berkeley summer sessions and got accepted (Im pretty sure they accept all applicants). It\u2019s like an in person course during the summer which lets you select your own classes and gives you college credit for them. It\u2019s about 500$ per unit, which comes out to 2500$ per course\n\nI\u2019m a risk on Junior, who recently moved from India and I\u2019m really confused weather It\u2019s worth that much money and if it would actually help during the college application \n\nIt would be greatly appreciated, if someone could share their experience about how useful it actually is towards the college app One could get the same college credits through a cc, which makes me wonder if it\u2019s worth it",

            "comment": "I had my daughter just take community college summer classes even though we live near enough that she could have done their program. We were mainly interested in her attending UCs\n\nReasons: \n1) in the weighted GPA calculation for her public HS and heavily considered in the UC/CSU systems any college class is equal to an AP. I knew she\u2019d get an A at a CC, less certain about that at Berkeley. You can look at grade distributions for Berkeley classes here: https://berkeleytime.com/landing. In classes where you have to compete with some of the smartest college age students in the state on curved exams I think a high school student would usually be at a disadvantage. Now a top junior at, say, Lowell or Mission high taking classes in their favorite subject would probably do fine. I didn\u2019t see the point of putting her in that kind of pressure over summer.\n\n2) CC is free for California public high school students and we were able to choose classes and teachers with good reputations\n\n3) she wasn\u2019t that fond of the Berkeley culture and the area around campus is kind of sketchy\n\nHonestly if you can walk into one of those classes and land an A that might tell some schools that you have what it takes to keep up anywhere in the US. I can see it being a positive in that sense\n\nUC admissions is more about how you compare to the other students at your High school in terms of taking advantage of the resources there and showing leadership/standing out. I didn\u2019t think it would help that much more than a CC class\n\nAs you are new to this country I\u2019d be hesitant to put you in a class that didn\u2019t have a high average grade on BerkeleyTime. If it feels like a financial sacrifice I wouldn\u2019t do it. If you have plenty of money, why not try and you can withdraw if the class isn\u2019t going well. You won\u2019t get your money back but\u2026 any grade you earn at a college will stay on your transcript even when you are applying for grad schools. I\u2019d definitely avoid taking a class there and getting a c or lower.",

            "comment": "I know someone who did Berkeley summer session.  First of all, they don't accept all applicants.  It is not special fake classes for high schoolers or anything - it is an opportunity to take an actual Berkeley course that has extra space (because less Berkeley undergrads are taking classes in the summer).  I believe 90 percent of the students in her class were regular Berkeley undergrads, and 10 percent were other high schoolers entering their senior year\n\nIt was a useful activity and she got college credits, but it is hard to say how much it helped in the college application process.  She got into a top school, but she might have gotten in anyway - there is no way to know.",

    "postText": "I'm a current rising senior who has interned at a very small, local CS company last summer and will start again this summer. I've established a good rapport with my supervisor, and he would definitely be willing to write a letter of recommendation for me about the internship. \n\nNow, my question is, how would I go about submitting this supplemental LOR? I know that some colleges with separate apps like MIT have a place where you can submit them, but what about the vast majority I'm planning on applying to using the Common App? Is there a place to submit them on the Common App?",

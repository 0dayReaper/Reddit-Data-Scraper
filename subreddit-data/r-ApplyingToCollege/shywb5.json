    "postText": "My best friend passed away two weeks ago due to an unfortunate incident: A car hit him when he was riding his bike to school. He used to be stressed about college applications as wanted to make his parents proud by getting into a good college. For the last two years, Michigan was his dream school. He always talked about how he would spend his time and meet new people at college. Unfortunately, he passed away just a few days before the decision date. His parents told me that he received a notification that he was admitted to Michigan. I couldn't stop crying listening to that. I think getting into your dream school but not living long enough is the saddest part of college applications. A lot of people on this sub are saying that they want to die. But remember, death is an end. It is empty and not as simple as it seems.\n\nTo all the people of A2C, enjoy your life along with building your profile for college as life is unpredictable and we might have to face something which we are not ready for.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys for all your support in the comments. And yes, I am doing well.",

Second, I get having a first, second, or whatever choice college, but it can be heartbreaking to see others feel their college choice (undergrad or further) is a life or death sentence. It is not. THIS is a sentence, and an undeserved one at that. Pick where you feel the happiest, even if it isn\u2019t \u201cthe #1 choice.\u201d Get over that mindset, acknowledge how much has been put towards your ability to simply further your education (whether that be money, time, energy, supports, etc). Just make the most of the options you\u2019ve been presented because not everyone is lucky enough to sit in the same chair as you. My thoughts are with this individual\u2019s loved ones and you.",

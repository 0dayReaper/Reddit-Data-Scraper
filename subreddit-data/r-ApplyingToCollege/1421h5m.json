They travel pretty much non-stop to high schools in their territories from August through the end of their main deadline (early action or RD, depending on how things break down).\n\nThen you've got to process applications.\n\nAfter that, it shifts to \"yield\" visits. These are between the admits and decision day, and the goal is to get people to enroll. \n\nOnce may 1st is past, there's a little bit of support for students through June to get registered and all set up. \n\nlate June/july/early august is basically down time. There's a lot of professional development and conferences to attend. Some vacation time. And then it's back to the grind. \n\nI've mostly discovered this by trying to meet AOs throughout the year and hearing what they're up to, and meeting them at said conferences in July..",

    "postText": "Hey, for my Junior year in high school, I'm aiming to take the following ap/honors courses:  \nAP Physics 2  \nAP Environmental Science  \nHonors Multivariable Calculus and Differential Equations  \nAP English Language and Composition  \nAP US History  \nCurrently, I'm on the fence about switching AP Environmental Science for AP Chemistry, as APES is a very easy class with an easy exam that won't do anything for my college admissions rather than the gpa boost. I'm thinking to swap AP Chem because it's more rigorous and would relate more towards the field of major that I'm applying in(something to do with engineering/stem and a focus in business, not sure yet), and that could help me in my admissions since colleges want to see your transcript most closely mirror that of a college transcript, and APES is way too easy for that. But at the same time my schedule is already a lot, althrough I'm prepared to handle it, I just want to know if the hard work of taking AP Chem is worth it over it being easier with AP Environmental Science.  \nAP Chem at my school is weird and different from what I've heard, the teacher doesn't really know how to teach and it's more a self-study course and all the grading categories are mixed up  \nI'd say mostly that I'm probably ready for the rigor of AP chem it's just that I was interested in having some \"free\" buffer classes to chill in, and in AP chem I probably can't chill since the teacher is still kind of strict, whilst in APES I can because the teacher is really easy too.",

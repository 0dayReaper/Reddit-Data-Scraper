I personally love UWs campus (I'm in state, my brother goes there) but hate the area. also what type of experience are you looking for? a bigger school or smaller? washington and seattle is gonna be more liberal than Florida etc. i would say plan on applying for both and see what happens. best case you get into both and decide in 8 months, but if you decide now and don't get into the 1...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nidk my hot take. also do note the weed-out classes and such. UW engineering curriculum is designed to weed kids out freshman/sophmore year. it will be very difficult.",

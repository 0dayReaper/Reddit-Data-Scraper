    "postText": "In Europe and US and other cultures they have middle name but in the Middle East our naming  systems are different it goes like this:\n\n1. First name\n2. Father's name\n3. Grandfather's name.\n4. Grandfather's father's name\n5. And the name of the rest of known ancestors names... .\n6. Family name/last name.\n7. Tribe's name.\n\nDue to this I don't know what should I write in my collage application for my Middle Initial/name.\nIn our legal papers in the Middle East when they say full name they do it like that:\n1. First name\n2. Father's name\n3. Grandfather's name.\n4. Family name.\n\nPs. Sometimes they also demand Grandfather's father's name.\n I hope these informations help you to answer my questions\n\nAnd I don't know what to put as my suffix",

But both my kids have two middle names and I\u2019ve had to confront this issue on numerous forms, plus I\u2019ve known other people who\u2018ve mentioned comparable snags.  Based on your second set of names, and my experience, I\u2019d say:\n\n1.  First name\n2.  Father\u2019s name (or BOTH Father\u2019s and Grandfather\u2019s names on the same line, if that fits on a given form)\n3.  Family name\n\n( . . . because it\u2019s a question of fitting into a narrowly constrained form as best you can, and if nothing else it goes \u2018in order\u2019).\n\nBUT, a possible exception:\n\nA Pakistani friend had a grandfather who was relatively famous in his field, and if I\u2019m not misremembering he swapped the two and marked down his grandfather\u2019s name when there was a fit issue so as to maintain that connection clerically.",

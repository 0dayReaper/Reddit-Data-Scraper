    "postText": "So i was writing my common app essay and i don't really know how, maybe it was the way i wrote it, but it ended up turning itself into a poem. I asked several people, googled it, and searched within the subreddit but I didn't see much about writing a poem as your common app essay here and the people i asked and google were pretty divided on it. i have confidence in my poem and when looking at my topic (red and the different things it represents to me via religion and religious trauma, culture bc i'm chinese, personal experiences, items, people, etc) , i think it lends itself better to a poem than an essay in general (i.e. structure, wording, nuance, craft, it'll also help keep down my word count while letting me write about more if that makes any sense). What do you guys think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: I am a creative writing person, i write in my free time, and I always get good grades on my creative writing even with tough grading teachers so this isn't like a gimmick just to impress admissions officers lol\n\nEdit: I've ended up deciding against writing it as a poem and I've switched the whole topic of the essay!",

Depends on if it works for the AO reading it or not.\n\nI would imagine the current and former AOs on the sub could tell you if they have ever encountered this before. I would imagine they have seen essays as poems, movie/play scripts, ascii art, etc. Remember that the AOs will scan this very quickly. If the poem format makes it harder to read/parse, they might not be happy.",

            "comment": "It wouldn't be my personal recommendation. I've written creatively for fun a fair bit, and a ton during the college admissions process, but I'm not sure a poetic format is going to cast your widest net. Reader response theory kinda gets into how there's many different ways and dimensions  in which literature and things live, based on whose perspective is being read. While I understand what you may be feeling about your poem  and how it reflects you, and Im sure that it does so in an amazing way, Id caution submitting as the common app essay based on how the AOs will approach it. They're going to be expecting an essay, and they're also not going  your essay more than a few minutes, if that. I don't think a good poem will express you in the most digestable way, given that it's almost certainly only going to be read once. Something a teacher taught me that really stuck with me in terms of writing  is that you have to meet peoples expectations before you can exceed them, and changing the format to one theyre not expecting and not used to probably isn't the best. \n\nFor me, I comprimised by including elements of my creative writing style ( and literary devices!) within the format of my essays. Good common app essays are simply good stories which talk about you, and you seem to have a good perspective on that already.",

            "comment": "Are you applying as a creative writing major?\n\nThe goal of a college essay is to communicate the type of person you are and why you would be a valuable contribution to the campus, with long term prospects for success. To tell your uniques, specific, and personal story.  It should be about you.\n\nIMHO, a poem about the color red seems unlikely to meet this goal. If you think you can meet all of the goals in that type of a format, as effectively as a standard essay, then give it a try.  But it sounds like a lot of effort, and don\u2019t expect the format/creativity to weight heavily. Again, unless you\u2019re applying as a creative writing major.",

From memory it was because a) it is very VERY rarely executed well, and b) changes the focus of the essay from being about the applicant to being about the craft of poetry. They learn less about the applicant than from an essay.",

    "postText": "He shared his college essay with everyone at our school by putting it on a website he made. Turns out he wanted many people to read it cause he thought it was quirky and funny.\n\nThe topic? **His childhood dilemma on having a crush on Velma from Scooby-Doo**. He had paragraphs talking about how he would become really shy around images of Velma at stores or toys that contained Velma.\n\nThe moral of his essay? **He claimed his attraction to Velma was significant because she was one of the least-liked characters in the show (he sourced a random website) and it showed that he would appreciate things/hobbies regardless of other people\u2019s opinions**. \n\nHe ended his essay with something like \u201cVelma was my gateway to the outside world and she will always be my first love. She extended her beauty to allow me to thrive while those around me locked me out. I doubt I will ever find a Velma, but I will drive my Mystery Van until I find the right path for me\u201d (not a direct quote but very similar to his own words).\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why he got rejected. He had a decent moral to his story, but I think the part where he said he would blush and feel attracted to Velma toys was weird asf. Not to mention he had other things in his essay that were creepy and slightly gross.\n\n**Future college applicants, do not write about being attracted to a cartoon** thanks",

No one even looks at your app if you're above a certain GPA and standardized test score threshold. We didn't ask for an essay unless you were waitlisted (usually meaning you were below the auto-admit threshold but above the auto-deny), if you apply through a special program, or if there was something unusual on their application that needed to be explained (I recall one student being asked why they had a huge number of absences senior year, for example). Of course it's possible not everyone does it this way, but I took a quick glance at the applications for some of our peer schools and none seemed to require an essay. So I would guess his safeties aren't as easy as he thought.",

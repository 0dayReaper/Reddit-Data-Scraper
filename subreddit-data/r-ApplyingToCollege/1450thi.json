    "postText": "Hey Hey, I'm a Junior (senior? im not sure what term I should use over summer is haha, that's the year I am going into,) in highschool (17m). I'm currently looking pretty heavily into college and freaking out to say the least.   \n\n\nIn all honesty, I haven't had the best time in high school to say the least. I have been chronically homeless throughout my sophomore &amp; junior years and have transferred schools 6 times throughout several states in the US. This has led to me having my GPA shoot down (I had a 4.0 my Freshman year) to a 2.8, which sucks. I am finally in a stable living situation (now living in Arizona) and hoping to raise my GPA to a 3.0 the first semester of my senior year if possible.  \n\n\nRight now, I am just wondering about my chances of getting into college? I'm kind of freaking out, yeah? I am hoping that the universities I apply to will be able to overlook the low GPA if I explain myself well in my application, plus the fact my records show I have been enrolled in mckiney-vinto &amp; my records showing a pattern of my grades falling each time I moved.  \n\n\nI got a 27 on the ACT for some more info. I haven't done the SAT but I would like too, and I got something around a 1350 on the PSAT when I did it a few years back. I'm also pretty confident in my writing skills, so the only real issue I see is my GPA.  \n\n\nI'm planning to apply to University of Hawaii at Manoa, which is the main school I would like to attend (Earth Sciences major). CollegeVine claimed I has about a 60% chance of getting in, though I am not entirely sure of how accurate that is. Anyways, thank you everyone for the help!",

            "comment": "Public universities tend to offer little to no need-based aid to out of state students and charge them more. UH costs 50k/yr out of state, though assuming Arizona is part of WUE, that would bring the cost down to 32k/yr. [https://manoa.hawaii.edu/fas/cost/2023-2024-cost-of-attendance/](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/fas/cost/2023-2024-cost-of-attendance/)  That sounds unaffordable unless you have college funds coming from someone, as you cannot borrow all of that by yourself. (Students are limited to federal student loans, starting around 5k/yr, totaling 27k over four years.)\n\nYour best bet will be in-state universities. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website, with the help of an adult if possible, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.\n\nIf necessary, there's nothing wrong with starting at community college and then later transferring to a four-year university.",

You probably should focus your search (mostly) on colleges that typically offer admission to students with GPAs in the range where your GPA falls. In addition or perhaps beyond that, you should make connections with admissions reps at colleges which interest you, share your personal story, etc. so they can keep an eye out for your application when you apply. You can do this via email, Zoom sessions, campus visits, etc. Feel free to send me a DM and I will be happy to assist you with additional questions/advice.",

But you will be able to get into many universities where you can get a quality education if you work hard.  Start with all the state schools or places you can get cheaper tuition, maybe even a CC (and transfer to a 4 year university later to save a LOT of money).",

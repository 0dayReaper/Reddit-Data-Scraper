    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising college soph, wanted to share this to give some perspective. Went to a decent public hs, 3.8/4.3 UW, 7 APs with probably around 7-10 honors courses. Range of 2-5 on AP tests with all 4-5 my senior year. CS/Finance major. No ECs aside from clubs and sports. Out of hs got into Emory (Oxford), CWRU, OSU, IU, UIUC (business rejected CS), Stevens. Rejected UNC, JHU, Villanova, and any other schools I applied to (I applied to like 20 but I forgot the rest). I am now attending OSU in a scholars program studying CSE. I applied to WashU and Northwestern for CS transfer from Osu with a 4.0 GPA and got accepted to NU. It is an amazing opportunity, though it is almost 15k a year more expensive and I\u2019d be coming in as a freshman (=extra year=extra 65k). Not to mention I am in love with OSU and the CSE program is quite strong. Roughly 92k average starting salary. I will be staying at OSU and while I\u2019m not their yet to confirm this, I truly believe the outcome of my life and career will be just as good if not better than if I had went to Northwestern. If I wanted to do consulting then maybe things would be ONLY slightly different. But what even is a consultant anyways that sounds boring. Moral of the story, you\u2019re success and happiness will be determined by your hard work, not your school. If I could give one piece of advice to myself 2 years ago it would be to never download Reddit and don\u2019t tweak out about not going to a t20. You will be okay, go where you\u2019re happy, live a life not fueled by prestige. Peace.",

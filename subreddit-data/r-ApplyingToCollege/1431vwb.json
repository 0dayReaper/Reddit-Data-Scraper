    "postText": "College essays are all about story telling. You want the AO to be moved, to understand you, to sympathize with you, etc. The essays are a moment to reflect on your life, the lessons you learned, the quirks you picked up, the passions that you've developed, and much more. You might have all of the stats, but so do thousands of others. In order to stand out you have to be able to advertise yourself. Advertising is all about telling a story and using that story to convince the buyer to buy what it is you're selling. \n\nReading literature, short stories, and essays really helped me when writing my essays. The most obvious way it helped was being exposed to great writing. In order to be a good or great writer you have to know what it is. It was also helpful to understand the format and flow of a story. The college essays are not standard five paragraph essays and shouldn't read like one. I don't have much creative writing experience, but reading short stories and literature helped teach me how to create  settings, character development, and plot. \n\nAuthors that really helped me: Joan Didion, Eve Babitz, Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, ",

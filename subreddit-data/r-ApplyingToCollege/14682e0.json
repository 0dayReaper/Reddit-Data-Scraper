Whether they still do, who knows. But since Stanford is one of the few schools that requires the courses and grades section to. Be filled in, I imagine they do download and parse that data.\n\nPenn and MIT, AFAIK, don't recalculate. Regardless, file it under \"it is what it is.\"",

They also don't tend to round at all even if you're a 89.99999999.\n\nI have had some courses though where two professors teach in the same semester and one definitely can be kinder in terms of rounding and grading so do your research.",

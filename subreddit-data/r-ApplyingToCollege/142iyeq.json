Obviously, you can adapt these activities to not be virtual, too. \n\nCS: App development (apply to have it in an app store if it's solid), Remote data science (email local professors or small businesses), Build a computer, Web design (make it applicable to something, you could even do your own personal website),\n\nEngineering: Order an Arduino or any circuitry/robotics/roller coaster parts off Amazon and play with it, try to build a contraption of your own from the things that you have at home, watch engineering YouTubers to learn more about the field, play with LEGOs, take something apart and put it back together, learn to code (believe it or not, this is a thing every engineer has to be very proficient at, at least in college nowadays). \n\nBiology: Start a journal club (read publications in a specific field and talk about the work with other people or just read on your own), look at virtual internships that local hospital systems may be offering, do virtual shadowing of physicians (believe it or not, it became a thing because of COVID). \n\nMath: Become a virtual tutor, learn advanced topics on Coursera/MITOpencourseware your local community college or any other online venue, find \"fun\" math problems &amp; textbooks to practice on daily, explore the intersection of coding + math. \n\nFor Physics, you can do journal club, tutoring, and like roller coasters or star-gazing if you're more into astrophysics. Environmental science, same thing for journal club, but also download botany ID or bird ID apps and explore nature based on your interests.\n\nHonestly, these at-home activities can work for any major, you just have to adjust based on what topics you're specifically interested in exploring. Note that there are tons of apps and websites for pretty much anything and this is not a comprehensive list of all the things that you could potentially do for any of these majors. \n\nHappy exploring your passions!",

If they've self-studied multiple courses through it, then they would usually include them under one EC and describe each course that was learned in the EC description space. MITx courses will offer certificates of completion for specific topics, which you can also include in your EC description and/or the awards/honors section because certificates would also count toward that category.",

They typically say I am too young, or don\u2019t respond at all.\n\nDo you know of any global health organizations off the top of your head? Again, the age issue is really difficult to circumvent. I have done a bit of digging, and there is one organization\u2026 I signed up for their newsletter recently but I haven\u2019t gotten anything yet.\n\nAny kind of internship is only for graduate and postdoctoral students, which is a bit unfortunate for me.",

            "comment": "First of all, know that music conservatories like Berklee often aren't SUPER generous with need based and merit aid.   Berklee often ends up on the more expensive end for a lot of families.  If your family is wealthy and you can afford anything, that's great.  Just something to keep in mind.\n\nI have  2 kids that auditioned for music programs.  Here's a rough outline of process. \n\n1. Spring/Summer Junior year - create a list of schools.  Run net price calculators and research typical merit packages.  Drop anything that isn't likely to be affordable.  \n   1. Create a spread sheet of schools with rep requirements for audition and audition process and date info, application due dates, prescreening requirements and application process.  \n   2. Note if schools have early audition options or online audition options.  Though I think auditioning in person is to your advantage when possible.  \n   3. Pick your repertoire for auditions and PRACTICE.  Note that pulling review music is fine.   It can be helpful to align audition requirements so you have to prep less.\n   4. Make sure you have a SAFE option.  It may be a non-auditioned option or a plan B.  Auditioned programs in general are competitive everywhere.  \n   5. If you have the option, try and request sample lessons with teachers at various schools\n2. Late Summer - open up the common app and any portals that require direct application to the school.  Work on essays.  Note that it isn't unusual to have to apply to a college AND a school of music/conservatory which may have different essays and application requirements\n3. Fall - record any prescreening videos that are required.   Edit and upload.  Complete applications by due dates.\n4. Holiday season - often audition scheduling season\n5. Mid Jan - Early March - often live audition season or online audition due dates.  \n6. April 1 - offers will be in.  Revisit, sample lessons, drop any too expensive options.  Waitlists do often move in music admissions.\n7. May 1 - committment day",

There are also big loans (I play cello, a conservatory level cello would be 15k+), plus you pay for music school. Also, wealthy families would be more likely to get their kids into music.",

Not any coincidence that schools might prioritize students that attend their summer programs at the tune of thousands of dollars for the privlege.   \n\nYep, talent is important.  But when we first started looking some of the most mediocre senior recital performances we found on youtube were out of the most competitive and expensive options my kid was looking at.  \n\nThere are more affordable paths but you really need to be careful.  What is interesting to me is if you go to any professional music performance, you will see a broad range of schools represented.   Especially for undergrad degrees.   You do not need to attend a high end conservatory and you need a variety of skills to be successful. Almost no one is JUST perfoming.  \n\nAnd just to be transparent, we are upper middle class.  My music kids have had plenty of privlege.  But we cannot afford high end conservatories that aren't generous with merit.",

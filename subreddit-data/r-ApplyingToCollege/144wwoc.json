    "postText": "I've been a lurker. \n\nBackground: For anonymity's sake, I'm going to be vague. I graduated Valedictorian, 4.0 UW/4.6+ W GPA, 1500+ SAT, leader in multiple school clubs, plenty of school awards, and knew I wanted to be in STEM. Everyone told me throughout HS that I was an obvious admit for a top school. I only got into 2/8 of applications. All of them were reach except my state school (definitely not considered a good one), which I got into and a good CS school out of state ($250k in tuition alone which I eventually rejected). \n\nI just graduated from my undergrad in Computer Engineering from my state school and will be going onto grad school at a T20 school. \n\nI want to say this: I see a lot of people asking and desperate about getting into a top school for undergrad. I was in your shoes. Finances and admissions didn't work out the way I wished. It's okay. Just because you don't get into a top school or don't get what you had fought for, doesn't mean it won't eventually work out.\n\nI was devastated after undergrad admissions. It was my first really big rejection overall, but definitely not my last. It was a big learning experience. You could do everything perfectly and things still don't work out. I ended up with a 4.0 GPA during my undergrad and awarded top graduate, 3 internships including FAANG, leader in student organization, a lot of full-time offers, and 4/8 of my graduate school applications (all of which were reach schools), and many more. All with virtually a full-ride at my state school. \n\nMake the most of the opportunities provided to you. You make those opportunities, not the school. Sure, having a name brand school may give you recognition, but what you do with your opportunities is more important. \n\nI went into my grad school applications with absolutely no hope. Literally -100. I was so dejected after the undergrad cycle I just applied for sh*ts and giggles especially because I had full-time job offers. I got into my dream school from my undergrad admissions cycle. While I may now be going to a top school, I now go into it with a completely different perspective. That school doesn't define my accomplishments. I got here because of my hard work and the opportunities I took advantage of - while having plenty (PLENTY!) of rejections along the way. \n\nEverything will work out.",

And despite concerns here about the quality of state flagships \u2014 of which I\u2019m a fan \u2014 you were offered excellent internships, multiple full-time offers, and had positive grad school results at your reaches.  With, if I read your post correctly, little to no student debt plaguing you for the next decade.  Assuming you also enjoyed your overall college experience \u2014 ECs, social experience, personal relationships \u2014 you lived the dream.",

Your own skills, attitude, and approach towards your goals make or break those opportunities. \n\nI ended up in internships with people who were in Ivy+ schools. Didn't mean, in the process, that they were any more qualified than I was. The initial resume screening and resources may and tend to be better, but that doesn't drastically change your capacity to end up and achieve the goals that you want - and I think that's the main thing to consider. There's also a reason why some and many people from \"normal\" schools end up in amazing careers while others at \"name brand\" schools could also be in desk jobs. \n\n\"Name brand\" schools open unique doors, but \"normal\" schools don't close those doors for you. It all comes down to what you take advantage of.",

In my case, attending a T10 law school (with a scholarship) cost less than attending a T20 law school.  And it was located close to the city in which I hoped to work, which is important for recruiting purposes, and had an excellent D1 sports program, which was important for my own enjoyment. But between my hoodies and bumper stickers, my friends and colleagues are well aware that I adore my T100+ state flagship.",

Admission into a school no longer defined me the way it did in HS, and that's what I was trying to relay. \n\nI had job offers and experiences in college that I was more than happy with and, quite honestly, projects for full-time that were some of my dreams. It had nothing to do with going to a top school anymore. I'm go into the next phase of my life knowing what I want, unlike how it was in HS.",

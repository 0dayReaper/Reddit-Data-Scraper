    "postText": "I placed top 3 in a national stem comp (not prestigious like isef or anything) and won a significant amount of prize money (4 digits). When including this on the commonapp honors section, should I include amount of prize money i got in the awards title? or should i just go into detail abt it when explaining the activity in the activities list?",

            "comment": "I generally argue against this unless the prize money was used for something meaningful - e.g. you started a business, funded your research/nonprofit, etc.  For example, the last four students I had who self-funded their research via five figure awards are now enrolled at Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and Duke.  The two I had who started businesses are at NYU (ED applicant) and UC Berkeley EECS (chosen over Ivy offers).  I don't think their success is coincidental.\n\nRemember that in most cases, you aren't the first person to apply who has that award, so AOs are probably aware of it.  They may not need you to tell them.  If it's truly obscure and you don't have a better way to include a quantitative detail, then it can be a fine approach because it immediately conveys the significance of the award.",

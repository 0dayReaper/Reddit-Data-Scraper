            "comment": "Real talk, I went to a university thats not listed in the top 200 schools in the US and I work for a top 4 company in its respective industry, 2 years after graduation.\n\nI meet people here who came from elite schools and this has been their first and only job since graduation (if they graduated in the past 3 years). \n\nSo elites schools might be a better launchpad post grad, but you can \"catch up\" regardless. \n\nI went to a community college, got my associates and got my bachelors at another university.\n\nTotal college tuition cost was $55k and I live in the NY/NJ/PA area. Meanwhile people who went to elite schools graduated with $100k+ in debt. \n\nMy starting salary prior to my current one was 45k, got another job to 65k, got a promotion to 75k. Switched to current job and I am getting 100k+. I held 2 jobs prior to coming to my second one, getting pay raises when switching jobs and promotions within. Both companies are smaller, lesser known companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the other associates I mentioned that went to elite schools started at 70k and are upto around 82k. \n\nSo not only can you end up in the same company as people who went to elite schools, you can even advance further then them and get paid more when coming in. \n\nReason for this is because the companies that hired them as freshers already equate their value as a entry level/junior in learning. Meanwhile if you gained experience elsewhere and you leverage it to a new company, you can come in as a junior/senior and get a salary bump of 10-15%. Majority of people get a 2-5% salary increase when you stay within the same company.\n\nTLDR : Which university you get your degree from is mostly useful in landing your first job, but your career progression is in your hands and you might take a little longer to get into a top company, but its very possible.",

I'm not sure how many people realize this, but if you stay with the same company for three years or longer (it could be 18 months, but I think it's three years) then you're basically losing money. It absolutely wasn't this way 15-20 years ago, but this is pretty much the new normal.\n\nEDIT: I guess I wasn't really clear. If you're not switching jobs every 18-36 months or whatever that time is, you're essentially losing money because you're not getting the same pay bump if you switched jobs. You're stuck getting that 2-5% increase (inflation alone is like 2-3% or so) instead of that 10-15%.",

Ivy league schools are largely unaffordable or don't make sense for many students, and people get into ivy league schools on a lot of factors that may not be representative of their abilities like legacy or URM status. Many students from very wealthy families also get in *questionably* through \"donations\" and other means that students of lower socioeconomic status often just don't have.\n\nEdit: and, obviously, some students don't even like the idea of the \"ivy league\" among other things. Many see it as a representation of elitism, concentrated and sketchy wealth, unfair admissions, etc. Location of these schools could also be very unappealing. There are clearly a number of factors at play.",

I have no idea how bashing a political candidate in a subreddit about college admissions is related to higher education\n\nLoan forgiveness; DeVos has been a massive cunt about loan forgiveness. So much so that she was held in contempt not long ago. She's a Trump appointee and under her the Department of Education has not forgiven the loans they said they would.\n\nUnder Warren or Sanders this wouldn't be a big deal at all. I'm not certain about Biden's position on it.\n\nEdit: google \"devos contempt,\" if you don't believe me. Also there are certain occupations that *earn* that loan forgiveness for working with either nonprofits or government for 120 months.

In fact, I mentioned how Rule 2 prevents that.  \n\nIf there is politics in this sub, it's within the context of college and is relevant to those who visit here. In this case it's a shitpost(not against the rules btw), but it fostered discussion about the merits of an T10/Ivy degree in politics. That's extremely relevant to people such as potential Political Science majors who want to know which colleges to apply to and how high to aim. Student debt is yet another example of something that should be talked about. I can see your argument working in a sub about hobbies or cat pictures, but college itself, and therefore this sub, are firmly intertwined with politics in more ways than one.",

Olson (born 1999/2000 (age 19\u201320)), who ran in the 2016 United States presidential election. His form to run for office was filed with the Federal Election Commission in late July 2015. In polls conducted by Public Policy Polling in Iowa, Minnesota and North Carolina in mid-August 2015, he polled at 8, 8 and 9 percent respectively, garnering the attention of the media. On October 11, 2015, Deez Nuts announced on his Facebook page his intention to run for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, citing his eligibility despite not being a member of the House itself and the scarcity of candidates.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

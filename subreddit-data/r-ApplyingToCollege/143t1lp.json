The rest of my EC's were more public health related + tutoring so you can try do some of that. Try to focus more on volunteering, but with more signficant service projects (like public health) rather than something like helping staff at a library or something lol and show your leadership. What do you do as an NHS officer? Maybe you can organize some type of community service event for members to get involved with?\n\nu could also try to organize events w the MSA as well. Its more about what u do in these clubs than your leadership title",

So I\u2019m guess I\u2019m on the right track with those two but do you mean starting one last intiative completely by myself?",

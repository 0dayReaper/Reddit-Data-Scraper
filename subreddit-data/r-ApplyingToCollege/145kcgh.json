    "postText": "I currently have a 1370 SAT score (700 EBRW, 670 Math) from the April 12th school day administration, which was my first time taking the exam. I am interested in schools such as UW Madison and UIUC, but UW Madison for example reports on their latest CDS that the 50th percentile SAT score was a 1440 and the 25th percentile was a 1370. Would it be worth retaking the exam in August to better my chances at specifically UW Madison because I am out-of-state for that school, or are test-optional policies inflating average test scores making it seem like a higher test score is necessary to have a fair chance of admittance? Thanks :)",

It's also suggested to send if all score breakdowns begin with 7s for both SATs and 3s for ACT no matter what the total score is and where it lies.\n\nBetween 25 and 50% consider submitting based on how it plays within your high school/environment. For example, if your score is between 25th and 50th percentile for a college, but it\u2019s in the top 75% for your high school, then it's good to submit. Colleges will look at the context of your background and educational experiences.\n\nOn the common data set you can see the breakdown for individual scores. Where do your scores lie? And what\u2019s your potential major? That all has to be part of the equation too.\n\nIt probably isn't good to submit if it\u2019s below the 25% of a college unless your score is tippy top for your high school.\n\nYou can find out if a school is test-optional by looking at their website or searching on https://www.fairtest.org.\n\nYou can find the common data set to see where your test scores fall by googling common data set and your college's name.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "I can\u2019t speak to how test optional affects the statistics, but these schools really want to see your sat if you can provide it. I know UIUC cares a ton about your stats (they don\u2019t even consider LORs). Try to retake it if you aren\u2019t happy with your score. Also, are those sat stats for the school as a whole or for your major/college. What you want to study will really affect how your application is reviewed.",

Then the original 88%, etc.\n\nLook at UW-M\u2019s 25-75% range in the last three years - 1300/1440, 1350/1480, 1370/1500.  With the percentage of applicants reporting scores at 100%, 61%, 56%.\n\nIt\u2019s always better to have a higher score, so if you believe you can improve, you could test again.\n\nI don\u2019t think it means higher test scores are a requirement for admission - it\u2019s a reporting artifact rather than an actual reflection of the admitted students, IMO.\n\nI\u2019d submit a 1370, as it\u2019s right at mid-pack of admitted students when full data was reported. But it\u2019s a bit of a toss-up.",

I had something lined up for this summer but it seems more and more likely it won't work out. I'm probably going to het a job but idk if that'll happen either and it j feels like a waste of my summer. i don't know how much this is gonna hurt me but I feel like....a lot. and this is my last summer that counts since I'm gonna be a senior next year \ud83e\udd20",

It's great that you tried to get some real life experience, though, but there are some other options to do this as well (maybe not as good as what you had lined up). So let's think about what else you can do to get some experience/knowledge about this field. Are there online classes to take? Independent research you can do? A personal project you can try? I do recommend doing something this summer, but please don't get overwhelmed with panic if your first plan doesn't work out.",

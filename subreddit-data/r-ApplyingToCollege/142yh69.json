    "postText": "I'm a rising senior and I was really wondering what goes into the higher ED acceptance rates for top schools. My top choices are UVA and Northwestern, but I'm unsure if ED will give me a better chance at either of those schools. I've heard so many conflicting things about how an ED boost exists or how ED admissions rates are higher because of legacy/recruited athletes/stronger applicants but for public schools and schools that accept majority of the class early like UChicago and Northwestern there seems to be a significant ED boost.\n\nThank u for all the advice!",

            "comment": "ED is the best form of demonstrated interest, but the boost is never as high as people imagine it to be. As you mentioned, the ED acceptance rates are higher because of multiple reasons. But if a school if your absolute first choice, and it's financially feasible, then you should apply ED there.",

In the deferral letter, they said that the fact that they applied ED would boost their chances in the RD round (paraphrasing). Student submitted a LOCI expressing continued interest and fit with specific programs at that school that paralleled current service activities and was admitted during RD. The student believes that their ED applicant status is what gave them the boost to be admitted to this school.",

People assume percentages are telling them about how \"easy\" it is to get in when that's not exactly true. We read the same way throughout the season. There's no easy round for UVA.",

They can take the higher GPA, better EC, better SAT students and not worry about them not committing. \n\nSo, now I stand conflicted",

    "postText": "Ok...I have listened to my children comment on this page for a few years now and felt it absolutely necessary to swoop in and provide some real world truth.....  \n\nMy wife and I have four children. The oldest is 29 and works in consulting in London, second one is 27 working for a bank in NYC, third is 23 and getting her law degree in a year, and youngest is a going to be a junior in college. We have lived this life of college applications/attendance/real world for over a decade consistently- with the youngest having gone through the \"change\" Covid year in acceptances. I don't think anyone is ever an expert in this field, because it changes so much and is always dependent on one variable that nobody can anticipate- human nature in an unkown person.  BUT BUT BUT....I do know this.... \n\nI hire people. Been doing so for decades. I have undergraduate and advanced degrees from schools people on this sub would consider \"prestigious\". I hire for all positions at a firm people would recognize. I typically oversee middle and upper management hiring, though I manage the individual who oversees early talent hiring.  So, in a nutshell, I know what we're looking for....  \n\nTwenty years ago your college mattered.  A lot. We targeted known programs at specific schools because we knew exactly the finished product we'd get from there.  We knew what skills they'd bring into the job, we knew their level of intelligence to grasp new skills, and we knew the department heads well enough to know their reccomendations were solid. Fifteen years ago college still mattered, but the cracks in the \"elite\" armor began to show. We began to shift away from targeting schools and more towards really looking at the details of the candidate's work. Not that we didn't do that before, but I'd say we would take a Wharton kid over a top shelf state school kid without pause twenty years ago and fifteen years ago we'd shift towards the standout state kid over the middle of the road Wharton. The state kid was often a better fit, had always shown excellence and ability to lead, etc.  \n\nTen years ago the world shifted underneath our hiring. What used to be 75-90% top fifteen schools was now 40-50%. We'd take the top kids from the top schools, but if you were out of the 10-15% someone else could hire you.  We simply took the top kids from any reasonable school. We actually stopped hiring altogether from one of the \"elite\" West coast business programs because we simply didn't believe their approach to our business was sound. They'd come in and tell their managers how to better do their jobs on day one. By all means, we want our new hires to bring fresh ideas and new approaches to success...but if we're a proven, globally successful firm over many decades and you come in and literally in your first week tell your group leader that he/she is doing things inefficiently? I'm not hiring you, and if a school is producing those employees....I'm not hiring from your school. Whether it's fair or not....I don't care. \n\nFive years ago.  Ok. We've now hit a new stage of hiring. Your school is quite literally the last thing I look at. I look at the accomplishments, I look at your skills, I look at how you've involved yourself, I look at any internships or jobs you've held (and I LOVE high school jobs that a HS kid should have- waiting tables, slinging ice cream, construction or landscaping, etc.).  I can sniff nepotism pretty quickly on your resume, and we know which jobs can be achieved by daddy's phone call and which are achieved through an interview process where the candidate needs to distinguish themselves.  Do I look at the college?  Of course.  But it's neither a positive or negative any longer.  I know the college application process is a) not fair b) flawed beyond repair c) no longer indicative of a student's true intelligence or skills.  Literally, never.  \n\nWhere are you in your class? I mentioned Wharton above. Years ago, mid-level or even bottom Wharton was going to be a smarter kid than most anyone from a more typical school.  No longer. The way that colleges have now blurred the line in pursuit of more profit (don't you EVER believe it's equity...these schools are making BANK on the new application process, and it's always about the $), I can't glean anything from an applicant's alma mater. I don't care if it's an Ivy, I don't care if it's a school rated in the 90's on US News.  What classes have you taken, what's your GPA, what involvement do you have? That's what I hire on, and that's what most of my colleagues are doing too.  \n\nSo....what does this mean? STOP CHASING PRESTIGE. It legitimately means nothing to any of us in the hiring world any longer. The colleges have killed themselves.  Go to a school where you'll thrive, enjoy your four years, and put yourself in a posiiton to look really good to us by succeeding as opposed to stretching to keep your nose above water.",

    "postText": "Saw somebody else make one of these and honestly I am pretty lost about this stuff and have very little guidance. Anonymous to avoid doxxing. I live in NYC and go to public school\n\nstats- 92.16 gpa weighted - weird IB program so only junior senior year is weighted, have a 42/42 and a 41/42 this junior year. 1550 sat superscored, took AP Bio in 8th grade and got a 4\n\nwamt to double major in biochem and music performance, or do at least a minor in music performance\n\njust have no idea what to put for targets and safeties or what even is a target these days. Feels like everything is a reach with such low acceptance rates.",

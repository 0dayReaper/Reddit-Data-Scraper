I suppose they must also be OK with some cold wind sometimes (I grew up in a similar climate and so personally think Chicago weather is overall fine).\n\nNow, for some people that kinda sounds like a nightmare.  And in fact in the revealed preference studies I have seen, Chicago ranks lower than you might otherwise expect, which I suspect is in part the climate but maybe even more so the reputation.  Indeed, for contrast, schools like Brown and Dartmouth (also top LACs like Amherst) seem to do relatively well in such revealed preference studies, which I think serves as confirmation the tough reputation of Chicago is serving as a deterrent to some.\n\nHowever, I think that sort of branding also works to the advantage of Chicago grads . . . as long as you are one of the people who thrives there.  Meaning people will see you as someone who was unafraid of hard academic work, who indeed thrived in such an environment.\n\nAnd that is not a bad branding to have--who doesn't want to select a serious, tough student over those who took the easy way out by going to a softer college?  I am exaggerating, of course, but this is the sort of swagger you can try to pull off if you are a Chicago grad competing with the likes of Brown grads, even if you stop short of saying it explicitly.\n\nSo it is like most of these things--pros can be cons and cons can be pros depending on what you make of them.  In this case, what might be significant cons to some people can be a pro for you if you really lean into it, precisely because that is communicating something about you to the people who know about these things.  But if you would hate it there, not such a good idea to try to pull that off.",

All of that has changed, a lot.  \n\nSocial life is much better - there are parties and frats and events like at any other school,  The college enrollment is three times bigger than it used to be.  Classes are still hard and people take academics seriously, but GPAs aren't significantly different than other places anymore.  All of the dorms are brand new and right on campus, and the whole campus and facilities are great.  The neighborhood has gentrified and there are lots of nice places to eat and hang out to the east of campus to the lake.  Plus Chicago is a fantastic city and the students take advantage of it.  \n\nUChicago college students used to drop or transfer away at a high rate, but now UChicago has the highest freshman retention rate in the country.  They all still wear \"Fun goes to Die\" T Shirts because it is part of the historic identity, but it just isn't true anymore.   \n\nOne thing is true: the weather is rough just like it is in the whole midwest.

The weather is definitely kind of brutal during the winter, but the other seasons are beautiful. Whether you\u2019ll be happy there depends on who you are and what you value in your college experience, but many people really do love it. \u201cWhere fun goes to die\u201d is mostly a joke among students at this point, besides a few people who choose to suffer over academics or aren\u2019t academically prepared. I\u2019ve genuinely loved my time there so far.\n\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t pay much attention to the other commenters calling Chicago or the area surrounding campus a \u201cwar zone.\u201d It\u2019s true that there is danger and crime, but most other schools in major cities have similar problems. If you have common sense and take advantage of the safety resources the school provides, you\u2019ll probably be okay. Hyde Park is a pretty neighborhood in a really wonderful city.\n\nObviously uchicago isn\u2019t perfect, but your time there will be what you make of it. You\u2019re not doomed to be miserable and suffering for the next 4 years. You\u2019re already committed, so you might as well focus on the positives of the school you picked instead of agonizing over what might have been.",

Please don't listen to old stereotypes about this school, or opinions from people that haven't even gone here.  Yes, it's an academically rigorous school, but there is no grade deflation of the past, and most all the students I know here are  happy. (There are moments of high stress, but you learn quickly how to deal with these. You've got to have good study skills, and make it a priority to meet people. The people not happy  ( and this goes for any university) are the people that don't make connections with friends and spend all their time alone) I'm a STEM major, athlete, part of a lab group, and I still have time for fun. When you get here, make it a priority to get to know others in your dorm and classes.\n\nHyde Park is a great little community, and the area around the school and Hyde Park are safe (Yes, its the city and you need to handle yourself that way; you don't walk at night and you need to be aware of your surroundings) As for the people that say its a war zone, that's crazy untrue. There are bad areas to the south and west of Hyde Park, but you have no need to ever go there. Not one of my friends, or teammates, has ever been robbed or anything scary like that. I come from a small town, so living in the city is completely opposite from where I grew up, yet I love living in Hyde Park.  Campus is incredibly safe, and Hyde Park is safe ( However, I wouldn't walk at night off campus; Take a Lyft ride or Shuttle.) Oh, as far as the weather, I grew up in the south and actually love the winter in Chicago. It's not as bad as everyone said it would be. Maybe my opinion of this will change after a few more years, but right now, I like the cold winters and snow. Dress in layers, wear gloves, and you'll be fine.\n\nComparing Uchicago to the other schools is just an opinion. Location wise, obviously very similar to Columbia and UPENN. I have actually heard that Dartmouth and Cornell can be quite isolating, and have their own issues, based on this. I love being in the city because here's so much to do and see; there's never an excuse to be bored.\n\nAs far as academics, Uchicago is probably most similar to Columbia. The classes are challenging, but incredibly rewarding. The research opportunities and connections are fantastic, if you desire this.  As long as you don't procrastinate, stay up on all your classes, and don't take a an insanely difficult schedule, you'll be fine.\n\nThe social life here is up to you. Meet people and don't close yourself in your room (the dorm culture here is awesome, unlike at a lot of universities, and you will meet friends for life)\n\nCongratulations! I wish I could go back to my first year and do it all over again.  Study hard, don't procrastinate, don't overload your course schedule, join RSOs and activities, and make lots of friends!",

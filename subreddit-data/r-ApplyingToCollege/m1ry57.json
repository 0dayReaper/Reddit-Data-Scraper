There are times when things should be changed to be more inclusive, but in this case, \"poor man's gold\" refers the the user Haul-Of-Frames who identifies as a man (in which case \"person\" is kind of misidentifying them with a label that they don't primarily go by), and because \"poor man's gold\" is a kind of idiom, and they are typically meant to remain fairly static in their structure, so as to remain recognizable, from what I understand. &lt;-- This is all just my personal understanding of the situation, and it is far from  being likely to be correct, so feel free to correct me regarding anything in this post.",

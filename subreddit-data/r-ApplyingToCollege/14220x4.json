    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI was lucky enough to be taken off Cornell's waitlist today - I am currently committed to the Turing Scholars program at UT Austin. I'm having a hard time figuring out which school to choose and would like to get people's thoughts.\n\nSome concerns I have about Cornell:\n\n\\- Location is pretty rural - does this affect internship opportunities?\n\n\\- Lots of liberal arts core curriculum in comparison to Turing\n\n\\- Just one of 800 engineering undergraduates; in Turing I would be 1/50, which could allow me to make closer relationships with professors (am interested in PhD programs after undergrad so this could be helpful)\n\nHowever, Cornell's name and prestige is definitely much higher than UT Austin, and I would be able to make a lot more connections there. Also, if I ever wanted to transfer during college, it might be easier to transfer within Ivy League than transfer into it????\n\nIf you were in my situation, what would you choose and why? Also does my reasoning above not make sense in some places? Cost is fortunately not a problem for me.",

            "comment": "The reasoning doesn't make any sense here.\n\nCornell has fantastic placement with internship and jobs in all industries, let alone CS where it is #1 in the Ivy League and #5 in the country. That should be the LEAST of your concerns, it could be in Antartica and still would pump out high paying CS grads.\n\nIt is harder to transfer within the T20 and I'm frankly not sure why you would want to...Cornell fields the best engineering school in the Ivy and by far the best CS program.\n\nIn any case, you can't go wrong with either. CS is not a field where \"prestige\" has any huge impact on your post grad opportunities, people from all sorts of colleges get into top CS firms. \n\nAsk yourself where you would be happiest and set aside seeking validation from other people in the form of \"prestige\". If you like UT Austin better, go there. If you like Cornell better, then go there.",

But also, the fact that SJSU is in the top 20 in terms of feeders to big tech is crazy since it is literally a top 200 school. Even Santa Clara Uni does well because of its location. So location is definitely a factor to consider... That being said, I would still go to Cornell.",

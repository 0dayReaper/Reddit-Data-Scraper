    "postText": "Hello, I am starting to piece together my college list and I am thinking of going as a Business, History, or Philosophy major. I want to stay in-state (Texas). I'm asian and female. \n\nOutline of Stats:\n-3.95 UW , 4.71 W  (Around Top 3%)\n-1330 SAT ( I have a tutor and will be retaking)\n-3 years of my sport (2 years varsity)\n-NHS and SPHS \n-Class officer position throughout high school\n-8 APs taken and will take 6 in my senior year\n\nList so far: \n-Texas A&amp;M \n-UT Austin\n-UT Dallas\n-Rice \n\nAre some of these not worth even applying (either it's too much of a far shot or they're not good schools for my major)?  I don't want to waste my time. None of my family went to school in the states and I don't want to use rankings as a guide. Are there other schools that should be on my radar? Thank you.",

Personally, in find the \"vibes\" at Baylor, TCU and SMU to be somewhat off-putting.\n\nYou'll be auto-admit to UT for Philosophy and History.  If you decide to apply to McCombs as a business major and aren't admitted, you're still guaranteed (AFAIK) a spot in the business program at A&amp;M.\n\nAsian and female doesn't really affect this decision, so far as I can tell.\n\nGiven your auto-admit status at UT And A&amp;M, the main rationale for applying to other public schools would be if you want a big discount -or- you want to commute and one of them is located near where your parents live.\n\nIf you want another (residential) school to add in the \"big discount\" category, could maybe add Texas Tech.  With your stats you'd also have in-state tuition at the University of Arkansas, if that's something you'd consider.",

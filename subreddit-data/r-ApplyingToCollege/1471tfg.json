    "postText": "I understand that gpa weighs a lot for top admissions because it shows how stable you are in maintaining top grades (or how much you can improve over the course of four years). However as an intl IBDP student, I only have a GPA for the first two years from one school, and IB grades (like predicted grades and such) for the last two years from another school. My GPA for 9-10th grade is super low compared to my IB grades (covid plus changed schools). Would my gpa for two years be weighted the same as other ppl\u2019s gpa for four years? Like if a uni has a common data set with average gpas for accepted students, would mine be counted in that data the same way as others?\n\nSorry if this sounds a bit confusing\u2026",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a current junior working on my common app, and adding schools to my list.  I am looking to add/get rid of colleges to/from my list.\n\nFor context, I'm planning on applying as an engineering major, but may go into finance. My UW GPA is 4.0, and my weighted is 4.48.  My ACT is a 33 (33E 32M 32R 35S) EC's are very mid.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Northwestern, Notre Dame, Georgia tech, UNC, University of Washington, Ohio State, University of Pittsburg \n(I am also applying to my local state school that I get automatic admission to)\n\nI know I have a lot of reaches, so I am looking for some more matches.  Still, feel free to recommend good reaches that are good for my major!\n\nThanks guys!",

Also most of these are way too expensive and unless your parents/aid are paying at least the majority of the tuition it isn\u2019t worth it.)\n- Carnegie-Mellon\n- Georgia Tech\n- Caltech \n- Northwestern (7% acc. rate but don\u2019t apply to these types of schools unless you\u2019re into the academic and social culture or you\u2019re from the Midwest. It\u2019s not a good engineering school compared to the others and it\u2019s way more expensive and harder to get into. That being said I applied just because of prestige and I live 40 min away).\n- MIT\n- Stanford\n- UC Berkeley\nUCSD\nUCLA\nUCI",

The foreign language requirement for Stanford is 3 years, and for UT Austin, it is 2 years. Does it matter if my foreign language course is an on level (non AP) course of if it is an AP course?\n2. Are there any other requirements that both colleges (and other good Engineering colleges) require to be accepted?\n3. Is there anything important for me to know before applying to colleges?",

Washington gives you automatic acceptances into 4-6 colleges if you have all your credits met and have  a 3.0+. Georgia tech does automatic acceptances to valedictorians and salutatorians. \n\nThe closest I've seen that is similar to this for non-residents of states is there are some schools which will admit by the numbers and tell you if you will be accepted or not. \n\n&gt;Stuff to look out for before applying, how to increase chances of being accepted, tips in general.\n\nRead the wiki to understand the process well. Look through the \"best of A2c\"  flair for helpful posts. iirc, the wiki also has links to some really useful posts as well.",

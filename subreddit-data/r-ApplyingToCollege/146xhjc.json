            "comment": "You need close to a full-ride merit scholarship or a college that meets full financial need. That should be your most important criterion. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\nAcademically, you have lots of rigor, but it's hard to guess what your unweighted GPA would be. You should calculate it yourself to have a better idea where you stand. Applying test optional exacerbates the uncertainty.\n\nI am assuming UIUC is your in-state flagship. Add a couple more in-state public safeties that are certain to be affordable per their Net Price Calculators.",

I'm planning on applying to various full scholarships like the Gates scholarship, but then again, it's not guaranteed. I qualify for full aid to all of my in-state schools because of my income",

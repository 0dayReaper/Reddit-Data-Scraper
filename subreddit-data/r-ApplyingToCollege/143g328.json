    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI am a rising high school senior and want to get a jumpstart on the Common App, specifically the personal essay. \n\nI have two topics I want to discuss but I don't know which one I should focus on more. \n\n1. *Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.*\n\nI would be talking about my family's small business and the community feeling I got from it, as well as my helping out and my growth with interpersonal skills. \n\n1. *Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others.*\n\nFor this one, I would talk about how I bit off more than I could chew my junior year in terms of extracurriculars, and how that negatively affected my classes. \n\nI don't know which would be the better essay topic. Any help/tips will help, thank you.",

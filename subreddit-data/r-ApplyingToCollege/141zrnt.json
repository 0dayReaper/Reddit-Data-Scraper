    "postText": "I'm really interested in folklore/the relationship between human culture and how it presents itself in our stories/myths. I'd love to either minor or major in a subject related to this in college. \n\nI've been trying to find something that would allow me to express this interest to colleges, but unlike other fields, there isn't really an internship or a summer camp or a competition. \n\nI live in a town with a university in it, that also happens to have a folklore/mythology/anthropology, which I suppose could have something? \n\nBasically, I'm looking for any advice on what activities I could do in relation to this. I'm not really into making clubs, and wouldn't want to start another club at my school (it already has well over 200 clubs and I feel that would be a waste of time).\n\nHas anybody here wanted to study something similar? Do you have any advice towards activities I could try to do? I've thought about reaching out to professors at the Uni near me, but what exactly would I do? I can't really provide any great help, as a 16 year old with no experience, and it's not like they have labs I can work in over a summer.\n\nThank you everyone :)",

Scholastic writing awards. 7. blog/social media page abt folklore\n\nI think you should continue growing your knowledge for history/humanities as a foundation through classes and volunteerism. Then, create a side project where you deep-dive into folklore!",

I would honestly look at the art and history museums in every metropolitan city in the U.S. (and your own city) and compile a list of the ones that offer internship programs so that you can apply to them. Even if the internship programs say they're only for college students, I would reach out and ask if there's an option for you to participate, too. You'll be surprised at how eager people are to help young minds learn.",

That's a web directory where universities post documents created by their professors and students, such as versions of academic papers or articles. That particular document was a graduate students' master's degree thesis. \n\nThis particular repository is called a digital commons because the materials are posted publicly for anyone to read. The site where I found the paper is the Digital Commons of East Tennessee State University. \n\nI bet if you search for other institutional repositories or digital commons, at universities with a degree program in folklore, you would find similar papers. Your local librarian (high school, public, college or community college) may be able to help you learn how to search. Good luck!",

    "postText": "Hello.\n\nIk my chances are practically 0 (I have near perfect GPA/SAT and some good ECs but nothing special by A2C standards) but my dream school is MIT. I don't care about prestige at all, I'm not even planning on applying to any reaches other than MIT and Caltech. I just fell in love so much with MIT... (I have safeties I like as well though, don't worry)\n\nI was just wondering, what does MIT even want? Are they actually more selective than other top schools? I've seen post after post of absolutely cracked students getting into HYPSM but not MIT. Obviously r/collegeresults is not in any way representative but I don't think I've seen anyone claim getting into MT despite seeing many, many posts for Harvard, Princeton, St. Anford, UC Hicago, etc. Even at my school, which although being a public school somehow has a track record of sending 3-5 people to T20s every year including HYPSM. Yet I don't of anyone from my school that has gotten into MIT.\n\nSo like... what is MIT looking for? Are they just that much harder to get into in terms of ECs and awards due to a self-selecting applicant pool or are they looking for something different in their essays than other universities?\n\nThanks.",

We had this one super smart guy in my grade that most of us believed to possibly be the smartest in our entire district, and his focus was on math (he\u2019s now doing a PhD at a top university). Everyone thought he was a lock for MIT but his dream school was like Princeton and he applied early there and ended up being deferred and rejected, and also failed to get into Harvard (his second choice) during RD, so he ended up having to go to MIT, which we all pretty much knew he would get into.   \n   \nAlso more anecdotes, of the 3 kids that got into MIT my year, only 1/3 of them had a 4.0 UW GPA. For comparison, everyone that got into HYPS + Chicago, Columbia, Duke, NU had a 4.0, which was probably about 15 students. The 2 MIT kids who didn\u2019t have a 4.0 didn\u2019t have a harder course load than those other admits I mentioned and if anything, it was probably slightly easier than the average HYPS admit\u2019s course load",

It feels like they look more for students with hands-on experience and \"workplace\" skills from things like team competitions, research labs, olympiads, etc. Unlike other colleges, they also have a *slightly* higher interest in AP/IB scores compared to other colleges, and they ask for all test scores to be submitted, so people that might have bombed a few tests may have a hard time.\n\nMy school has had around 3-5 MIT admits per year and they all tend to have focused less on AP courses and more on dual-enrollment (or in my state, PSEO/UMTYMP) classes to get credits. They're not exactly nerds, and they do a lot of stuff outside of major-related things like sports, student-advocacy stuff, etc, but when it comes to their core interest, they go really far ahead in taking the strongest possible courses to support their interest. \n\nCompared to what gets thrown around on collegeresults, most of the MIT admits that I know weren't superhumans and were instead really dedicated to what they were interested in as a career and spent all of their time in highschool learning more about their field and its tangents.",

Amongst our graduating class, a lot of the people that had better luck with MIT admissions either graduated the program in 10/11th grade (and also took the later classes) and/or had one of their LORs from UMTYMP.

I feel like I genuinely have to live and breath academics here, whereas I was relatively less stressed in hs, all while playing national level sports with all aps. Somebody who isn\u2019t a nerd on some level would be VERY miserable at mit and a poor fit. many more students would have a better fit for ivies than at Caltech/masstech/uchicago/insert try hard schools\n\n-they don\u2019t auto admit athletic recruits, even those with perfect sat scores, and give no preferences to legacies. that obviously steers quite a lot of people away from mit and towards Ivies and other schools that welcome great athletes who may not be super geniuses or the children of parents who both went to Cornell or something\n\n-also not on common app, so extra work creates that extra hurdle to favor self selectivity\n\n\n;tldr mit is very self selecting for quirky academic masochists (in a good way of course) with less crapshoot apps and auto admits, so it may feel like more qualified applicants are getting rejected",

This isn't to say that MIT students are socially incapable, rather to say that they're purely looking for people who can do a complex math problem in their head, and high SATs aren't enough in their mind. People from there aren't the big club leaders or the captain of the football team, they're the people who are just plain flat out smart, and If you're smart and can display that intellect then you've got a really good shot at getting in.

I do know what T20 means, but maybe others don't. Here's how writing works:\n\nThe first time you mention something you give its full name, and you can follow that with the abbreviation in parentheses if you plan to use that abbreviation. \"I'm applying only to liberal arts (LA) colleges . . . .\" \n\nFor this reason, as the head admissions reader for MIT, I am afraid we must reject your application, but good luck at whatever school admits people who don't know how to write well.",

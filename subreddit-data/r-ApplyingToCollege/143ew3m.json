    "postText": "hey guys so i\u2019m gonna be applying to college this fall. basically i\u2019m in between two pathways but i\u2019m leaning way more towards one. i think i\u2019ll be applying as an environmental science major and i hope to eventually do environmental policy/law. currently i have a 3.98 gpa. i\u2019ve taken  basically all ap/de and honors classes in high school (except math). the only class i struggle in is math but the rest of my grades are good. i have many positions of leadership and i have a shit ton of extra curricular activities, i work during the school year and i\u2019m a varsity athlete. i\u2019m a first gen latina student. what are some schools i should apply to? what are some schools with good environmental programs? also what are my chances of getting into some of my reaches? (uva and boston college/ university atm) im looking to stay in the US but i am interested in studying abroad but no matter what i NEED scholarships to attend school. for context i\u2019m from (northern) Virginia btw. for even more context i don\u2019t want to stay too close to home, so i most likely won\u2019t be applying to any DC schools (i live forty minutes away) thanksss :)",

If you run your family's financials through the net price calculators of some \"meet need\" private schools, do their estimates come in under your budget?\n\nYou may want to leverage your status as a first-gen Latina athlete to compete for scholarships that have those things as prerequisites.  Various schools have competitive merit-based scholarships with a diversity prereq.  WashU and Wisconsin are the two I know off hand, but I'm certain there are others.  I'm also not sure whether either of those schools has an environmental science major; you'd want to check.  There's also the Morehead-Cain scholarship to UNC, which has athletic participation as a prereq.",

As to where you work, apply to jobs that are a short distance from home or school and pick the one that you think you'd most enjoy, due to the kind of work, the kind of good/service you'd be providing, and the crowd you'd be serving.  In my area, coffee shops (for the crowd), restaurants (for the tips), doggy day care (for the fun), retail apparel (for the discounts) and kids' day camps and afterschool program are pretty popular.  Good luck!",

After a few days call them to ask the status of your application, they may give you an interview then or tell u they will contact you later. \n\nIf you live near many many restaurants take some time to research employee experience as you're applying. Some jobs will treat you much better than others. IE you will see alot more public hate for a job like Starbucks than taco bell.",

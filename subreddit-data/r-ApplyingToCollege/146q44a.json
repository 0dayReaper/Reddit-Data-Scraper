            "comment": "Contrary to the popular belief, CS is actually not a very demanding major in terms of hardware, unless you have any specific needs like Gaming or AI/ML. Also check with your university to see if they have any particular requirements. If you have an older laptop already, you could continue using that one for an year or two. If you're looking to buy a new one, check out Costco or Best Buy for some good deals most of the times. You can also check out Walmart or Target for any current deals. While you could work with an i3 CPU with 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD, for a new system I would recommend a minimum of an i5 CPU with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, and ideally an i7 CPU with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD for any future needs.",

I use a Dell XPS 13 for cs and I love it, super lightweight, runs really well, and I wanted to game so it works for that too. I also have my old high school iPad that I use to take notes in math/science courses. I know cs majors on macs tho and they\u2019re fine. So long as your school doesn\u2019t recommend one over the other",

They may even have a link to deals on specific models.\n\nI would not do an Air and not an iPad for CS. I tend to buy from Dell outlet, though I prefer new rather than refurb.\n\nI agree w/Prseghal's recommendations for specs. (Caveat, I am just a mom with several kids, one of whom is a CE major, and I feel like I'm often computer-shopping.)",

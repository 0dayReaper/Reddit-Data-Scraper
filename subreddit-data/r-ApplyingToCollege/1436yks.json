So I\u2019m trying to clear up an extenuating circumstance I had that caused me to get B\u2019s my junior year (if you want more info, pls check my post history\u2026 sorry, I have no idea how to do the hyperlink thingy on mobile \ud83d\udc80)\n\nAnyway, I was wondering how much an extenuating circumstance explanation in the \u201cadditional info\u201d section + a counselor letter can \u201cnullify\u201d an issue. Basically, will colleges overlook the \u201cissue\u201d as a factor in admissions?",

            "comment": "It\u2019s just very hard to say.  It depends on the circumstances, if they are verifiable, if they impacted you in an understandable way, if you have \u201ccome back\u201d from those circumstances, and if there\u2019s no reason to currently believe you wouldn\u2019t make a great addition to a university community. \n\nFor example, I have a student with a chronic illness.  Sophomore year was rough because of pain, absences, and often 3+ medical appointments per week.  Junior year was slightly better but also included a nearly month-long  absence for OOS treatment.  While the student\u2019s grades were quite good, EC\u2019s were definitely impacted.  However, the student\u2019s admission results were quite good.  The student explained their medical condition and treatment in the \u201canything else\u201d essay, their counselor verified the condition in her letter and offered how well the student had performed despite the condition, and the student\u2019s EC\u2019s had improved over their high school career making it clear that they could and would be active in college life. We also used the main common app essay to go light and discuss active vacation mishaps, which hopefully showed that the student was not just a sad, lethargic hardship lump. \n\nHope this helps.",

Your example certainly helped (I have a family member with a similar condition\u2014 I\u2019m sorry your student has to go through that).\n\nThe good news is my counselor said she\u2019ll notify colleges of what happened once I provide her with info. So I\u2019m a bit confused on how I should word the \u201cincidence\u201d. Ideally, should she talk about how I had a slight grade drop due to a surgery and how this was abnormal and unrepresentative of my true performance? \n\nThank you once again for the reply!",

Something like: \u201cWhen considering Alp\u2019s junior year grades, it would be helpful to know that Alps suffered from appendicitis, an appendectomy, and the subsequent recovery from surgery in [month/year].  All told, Alps missed [x] days during the [ ] semester, which likely explains the dip in grades that occurred during that period.\u201d",

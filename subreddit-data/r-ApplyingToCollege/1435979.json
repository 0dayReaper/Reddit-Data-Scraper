    "postText": "When I was a freshman I wasn't a great student and failed every class. I only moved on to the next grade because I live in a small town of 45 people, and the high school needed somebody to be a sophomore. Fortunately, my grades have improved as I have dropped out of high school and can no longer fail any classes. I know colleges like to see an upwards trend, so I'm hoping Harvard and the rest of the ivies aren't out of the question.",

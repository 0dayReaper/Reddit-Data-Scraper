You could try cross country/track if you\u2019re set on a sport, or skip it all together.  Check out clubs in your school too. \n\nThe medical shadowing seems like a good way to show interest in what you want to study.  You might be able to find volunteer opportunities in your area as well if you have the transportation.",

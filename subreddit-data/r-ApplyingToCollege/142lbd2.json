    "postText": "Does anyone have experience of a loss of family member affecting their grades? My grade 11 grades fell significantly, and part of it may be because my grandmother passed away during the finals dates - should I tell this my counselor? And if so, can they make a note or something on my transcript noting that the fall of grades is partly due to my grandmother passing away?",

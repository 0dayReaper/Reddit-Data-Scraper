Im also hoping said universities have very generous financial aid since I don\u2019t know if my parents will be able to pay or if they are willing to. To the US, my family is considered very wealthy income-wide but our money is being redirected at more important things at the moment but this situation might change when I go to uni (I\u2019m a junior (technically)). Im worried they\u2019ll see our income and decide I don\u2019t qualify when we genuinely don\u2019t have any money to pay school fees, if we pay we won\u2019t have any money left, and I mean $0 left, if not in the negative.\n\nI go to a British school (I\u2019m in Asia tho), I\u2019m currently finishing my IGCSES and plan to technically skip a year because I\u2019ll do 2 years at the same time next school year, I\u2019d be graduating when I\u2019m 17. Are SATs still required for me? And also ACTs? What should I do to make me seem like a good applicant and raise my chances of getting accepted? Im (obviously) not a US citizen (plan to become one during my studies) so will that lower my chances of being accepted? \n\nEnglish is my second language (although I\u2019m studying at the first language level), would I be required to do an IELTS exam?\n\nHow many universities offer astrophysics as a bachelors, have generous financial aid and accept international students easily (not biased) \n\nI\u2019ve researched but decided that if I get advice from people who actually live in the US it might make things easier and clearer",

The answer i found is that nope, high grades won't make us qualified because the need blind universities for intl are:\n\nHarvard\n\nYale\n\nPrinceton\n\nMIT\n\nDarthmouth\n\nArmherst\n\nBowdoin\n\nBrown(2025)\n\nSo, very competitive schools where good grades are the norm, and ecs, LOR, essays will be the determining factors that admits/denies students, and the qualifications change every year, for each universities. So a person may get accepted this year, but next will be denied etc. Apparently, intl students(and students in general), have to show that they will be a great part of the community, work hard etc, and make the schools go \"Wow! we must have this kid on our campus!\"",

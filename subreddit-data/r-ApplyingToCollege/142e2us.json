    "postText": "I'm a rising senior and looking for **the best possible** options (internships/camps) to do with my summer considering my situation:\n\nBeginning of the semester applied to well within the deadline to 5 prestigious (S-tier tbh) summer programs, mostly research, including Garcia, SSP, BWSI, BU RISE, YSPA\u2026. Needless to say, rejected from all the waitlist opportunities. I procured two backup options last-minute that I got into, but one is a terrible waste of money (good experience for freshmen I'd say) and a pre-college program at an ivy league (pay to get in though).\n\nI am desperate for some **high-level opportunities/internships,** not pay-to-get-in and worthy. My plan when I fly home is to cold-email 50 local professors. If needed I also am down to work at a research program throughout the senior fall semester.",

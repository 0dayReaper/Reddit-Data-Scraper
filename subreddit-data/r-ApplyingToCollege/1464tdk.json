With students like yourself there is the danger of coming across as too \"Type A\" and cynically \"transactional\" in how you deal with your teachers. Don't be that guy.  Also take care not to come across as full of yourself and/or disparaging of other students.  For instance, if you're assigned a group project and your group mates aren't doing their fair share of the work, don't be the guy who complains to his teacher about how lazy and unmotivated his group mates are.\n2. Do your best to wrap your mind around the sort of student these schools are looking for, and take care to present yourself that way in your essays and in interviews.  You want to avoid being perceived as the prestige-obsessed, hyper-ambitious box-checker who pursues awards and activities like he's collecting achievements in a video game.",

And for point 2, should I contact current students/professors during my junior year/summer? Also do you have any tips on improving my extracurriculars to help craft my theme/spike?",

Check out what these schools say they look for and consider what things might be a turnoff for readers.  I strongly suspect that \"cookie cutter\" Ivy+ applications are recognized as just that:  cookie cutter, and that it works against those applicants to some extent.",

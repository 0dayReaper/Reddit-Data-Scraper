    "postText": "Title describes my problem. I'm a Texas resident, and Texas A&amp;M is a really damn good school that I would be more than happy to attend, but I don't know what to build my profile for/major to apply to, not just for A&amp;M but really any college.  \n\n\nI'm looking for something with a high degree of academic challenge and decent job prospects. Nothing is below me or too obscure, be it nuclear engineering or civil with a specialization in sewage.  \n\n\nIf it's relevant, most of my acheivements are in CS or math. Biggest one right now is that I placed at ISEF within the mathematics category, 1x AIME, and I have a paper in the works that is PSCI x Math.",

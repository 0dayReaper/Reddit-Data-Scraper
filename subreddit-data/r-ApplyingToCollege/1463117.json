    "postText": "I'm in the process of (admittedly rushedly) applying to several colleges as a transfer, and unlike last time I applied to schools, I'm very sure of my major: Anthropology Major, Archeology track, double minor in Textile &amp; Environmental. I am wondering whether it would be good to reach out to staff in those depts right away to make connections and/or get advice on applying, and how I would be best going about that.",

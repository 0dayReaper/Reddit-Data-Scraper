You expected to be going through a very exciting and transformative period in life right now and suddenly you're stuck in limbo. \n  \nIf there's one silver lining I can offer, your college experience is going to be twice as amazing when it comes. Freshman year is already a beautiful escape from your old, controlled lives into a freeing and adventurous new time. You know when you edge just to make the bust twice as good? Y'all gonna have the greatest fucking time imaginable when this crazy storm subsides and you're finally free again to explore with your peers. \n  \nStay strong out there",

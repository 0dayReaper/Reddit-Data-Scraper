College is about networking. 95% of all schools expose you to roughly about the same material, some make it more easily digestible than others; only difference is the connections you make from going to a certain college can make a world of difference. \n\nMost colleges funnel into certain titan corporations/companies, so just by having a degree from a specific place can open doors for you regardless of your educational performance. That's why people go to these expensive Ivy league schools, because their connections to the upper echelon positions are uncanny. \n\nBig takeaway here is to network as much as possible and get your face and name out there, that way people can sponsor and vouch for you.",

While in a broad sense this correlates somewhat to good grades, far more important is the overall student candidate, and qualities like emotional intelligence, communication skills, leadership skills, innovation and creativity skills (all of these not measurable with just grades alone).\n\nIf you as a business (college) focus only on kids who put all of their energy and focus into SAT prep, test taking and homework, you are likely to end up wit a lot of introverted or socially immature academics, limiting your chances for success. This is why the college process is holistic. Each school uses their own formulas, but their goal is not to create students who excel in academic tests, but to find students who will thrive in general, and primarily, financially.\n\nYou also have late bloomers (high capabilities, but perhaps didn't start to focus as 13 year old HS freshman), folks who ran into a personal situation (family death), and all sorts of caveats that would make pure GPA hunting silly.\n\nI love how Australia ignores family wealth. But if they truly ignore sports (most of the worlds executives and higher level leaders tend to have played sports, were competitive, and benefitted from the social aspects of it), ECs, creativity, communication skills, they aren't focused on the big picture as well as they can be.",

            "comment": "Worst Ivy, that\u2019s funny. Pass this on to her:  \n   \nIs a university really better simply because it is more selective, regardless of why?  \n   \nHere are some recent admissions stats:   \n\\*Harvard: 3.1%  \n\\*Yale: 4.4%  \n\\*Princeton: 5.7%  \n\\*Cornell: 7.2%  \n   \nBut Cornell admits by College:  \n\\* College of Agriculture and Life Sciences: 12.88%  \n\\* College of Architecture, Art, and Planning: 8.10%  \n\\* College of Arts and Sciences (CAS): 5.39%  \n\\* SC Johnson College of Business: 4.17%  \n\\* College of Engineering: 6.12%  \n\\* School of Hotel Administration: 16.47%  \n\\* College of Human Ecology: 15.70%  \n\\* Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR): 18.26%  \n   \nSo the largest college at Cornell (CAS) is technically more selective than Princeton, albeit barely. Let\u2019s call them comparable.  My kid is a physics/math major in CAS, so I guess I could just stop there and revel in the pretension.   \n   \nBut now let\u2019s look at how Cornell\u2019s other colleges place in the rankings:  \n\\-Agriculture: Ranked #1 Nationally   \n\\-Architecture: Ranked #3 or better Nationally, #1 in Ivy League  \n\\-Business: Ranked #13 Nationally, #5 in Ivy League.  \n\\-Engineering: Ranked #13 Nationally, #1 in Ivy League  \n\\-Hotel Admin: Ranked #1 Nationally  \n\\-Human Ecology: Ranked #1 Nationally  \n\\-ILR: Ranked #1 Nationally  \n   \nYes, Cornell\u2019s Hotel Admin program is statistically \\~5x less selective than Harvard, and its USNWR ranking takes a hit because of it! But if you are a student there, do you care? Presumably you want to know how to run a hotel, and you are in one of the best places in the world to learn how to do that.   \n   \nSo what would Princeton\u2019s College of Agriculture ranking be? Who knows? Perhaps not too bad (Garden State and all\u2026), but the point is that it doesn\u2019t have one.   \n   \nIf you are obsessed with prestige for prestige\u2019s sake, you might conclude that many of Cornell\u2019s highly-ranked albeit less selective programs aren\u2019t particularly important because the subject matter is too utilitarian or \u201cblue collar.\u201d You may feel that Cornell admitting into Agriculture at 12.88% would dilute the value of your 5.39% CAS diploma. But I don\u2019t think Cornell cares too much about that, as long as it is fulfilling its academic mission to teach anything to anyone who is capable of learning it. \n\n \n\nCornell is a decidedly forward-thinking, egalitarian university that has been traditionally more strongly influenced by 19th century American pragmatism than the other Ivies, who were all founded during English colonialism. If her point is that Cornell feels qualitatively different than the other Ivies, that is true; it is the easiest to separate as \"different\" than the others.  \n   \nYes, there is no denying that Cornell identity carries undertones of old-school privilege as well. But Cornell has always been interested in advancing all forms of knowledge regardless of stigma, including applied science and engineering. In that way, it is much more historically similar to Stanford than the other Ivies are. This is no coincidence, Cornell and Stanford were founded a mere 2 decades apart; Leland Stanford modeled his university largely after Cornell, the campuses were designed by the same architect, and David Star Jordan (Stanford\u2019s first president) and a large fraction of the first Stanford faculty were all Cornell-affiliated.   \n   \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think the other Ivies are each great in their own ways. I was at Yale for postgraduate training, and I loved the camaraderie there and found most of my colleagues and teachers surprisingly humble. I\u2019ve been at Penn for over a decade, and admire Ben Franklin\u2019s university immensely. Princeton is beautiful. A few of my closest colleagues are Harvard grads, and they are incredibly talented and surprisingly chill. Ivy league schools are all pretty great, although they by no means have a monopoly on that.  \n   \nBut Cornell is sometimes considered a \u201clesser\u201d Ivy owed to factors that I believe are many of its greatest strengths, namely:  \n  1. Having a shorter history that that has always focused on individual merit, Cornell is less supplicant to the American aristocracy than many of the other Ivies are.    \n  2. Cornell has always considered women and men equals, which is not true for the others; I am sure that many men attending Harvard (1977), Yale (1969), Princeton (1969), and Columbia (1983!) felt that the addition of women to the student body made their university less \"prestigious.\" You read that correct, Star Wars and co-ed Harvard are the same age.  Cornell has been co-ed since 1872.    \n  3. Cornell is \u201ctoo hard\u201d and suffers grade deflation. For one thing, all Ivies can be pretty hard. For another thing, this tells me that a Cornell degree actually has some value (see individual merit, #1).         \n  4. Size. As the global population has increased and the number of qualified applicants have exceed the capacity of \u201celite\u201d universities to accommodate them, Cornell\u2019s larger class size has been able train more people \u2014 while still managing to matriculate kids with 4.0 GPAs and 1500+ SAT scores. Let\u2019s check back in a few decades and see how graduating double the number of top-percentile students than any other Ivy (save Penn) works out for them.   \n  5. Its land grant status gives it access to additional resources and a broader mission in applied sciences.  Yes, it is almost a private-public hybrid, and \u201cpublic\u201d is a dirty word for many. But it also means that Cornell has a unique culture that borrows from (IMHO) many of the best aspects of both worlds. Are you looking for a Stanford-like Ivy League university that has structural similarities to other land-grant schools like Berkeley and MIT? Hmm, I don't think there are a lot of choices out there.   \n  6. Cornell\u2019s wilderness location and enormous campus gives it a much more ivory tower feel and immersive experience than most other Ivies, except maybe Dartmouth. My kid says it feels like being at a real-world Hogwarts. Yes, that is a bit isolating as well; it is intellectual immersion. But Cornell also has opportunities at multiple satellite campuses in NYC, which rumor has it is a pretty big city.  \n   \nThat having said, do I think Cornell is \u201cbetter\u201d than Harvard? No, of course not. But not because USNWR. Not because Harvard&gt;&gt;Yale&gt;Princeton&gt;&gt;Columbia&gt;&gt;Penn&gt;&gt;Brown&gt;Dartmouth&gt;Cornell, or whatever.    \n   \nAnd I think in the long run, Cornell will be on the right side of history about many things that they currently get crap for, including traits that detrimentally influence the pseudo-objective college rankings.   \n   \nSome unsolicited advice; find places where you think you\u2019ll thrive, rather than based on arbitrary numbers. There is no substitute for doing your own research, taking charge of your own life, and making the most of any opportunity given to you. Now is a good time to start.  \n   \nTell her that.",

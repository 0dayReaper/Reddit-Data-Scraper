    "postText": "Went to community college for 2 years taking gen eds for my Bachelor's. Tried the actual program for my major at CC. Withdrew from the program due to mental health issues related to something the CC would make me do (Nursing, would make me do clinical at a location I was traumatized at).\n\nNow I'm floundering about looking for a 4 year, any 4 year, that will accept me in the spring. Now people in this sub say \"I'll go to my state flagship\" or \"I want to go to a top state university!!\" when due to cost of living that's probably not going to happen for me. Hell no am I taking out loans or working myself to death to live on campus. I'd rather do a different major available in the area. \n\nAnd I'm 20. Meaning many of you are younger than me.",

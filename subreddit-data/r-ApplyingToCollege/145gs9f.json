    "postText": "hi i'm a us student thinking of applying to uk schools. is there anyone here who has done the ucas application and who can answer some questions for me?\n\nwhat should i take into account when considering applying to uk schools? what are the benefits/drawbacks?  \nare uk schools more inflexible in terms of choosing your classes and deciding what to study in comparison to us schools?  \ni've looked into the ucas application and the requirements listed on the oxford and cambridge website and while this isn't mentioned on the ucas app, the oxford website lists required tests for certain courses (like the HAT test for history courses). how do us students take these tests? are there different requirements if you're not applying from the uk?\n\nif someone can reply or pm me i would greatly appreciate it!! :)))",

            "comment": "Just to get you started: most UK bachelor's programs are more like US graduate programs in that you apply for and are admitted to a specific \"course\" (eg, Biology or Math or English or so on), and usually people do not switch (indeed, switching can basically require you to start over in many cases).\n\nAs a result many are only 3 years, or go through a Master's in 4, and might be pretty competitive on total cost for a US student who is sure what they want to study.\n\nThe Scottish universities are a bit different in that they are four years instead of three like most UK universities, and you have enough \"elective\" classes in your first couple years that you could potentially switch courses, but still usually only to something you had already been doing.\n\nThere are US test centers that give the special entry tests.  If you have identified a course at a UK university that might interest you, you can google up US test centers for any required entrance exam.",

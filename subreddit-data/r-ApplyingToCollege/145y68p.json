    "postText": "Hi, I'm an international and I took many Ls for the last application season. I tried rolling decisions and didn't get enough aid to go to any that I got accepted to. Waiting to hear from one but I don't think that will work out with how things have been going. I might not get into University in my country either, since the entrance exam was so hard and I messed up badly. It will be a miracle if I even get it. I just would like to take a break this summer to recollect myself. If I do end up taking a gap year and I might just apply again, will it look good to admissions officers if I decide to take a break from summer programs or volunteering to prioritize my mental health?

If you didn't get into any international schools, I'm not sure you could expect a different result next year since financial aid is apparently an issue, and is not easy to come by.  What is plan B if international schools are out?  When do you find out about in-country admissions?  That would have bene my plan B, and I would be activating that plan.",

I believe it would be like in July or early August, I will hear back from them. Just a small edit: I did already had plan b in action after getting rejected, but after that entrance exam, really uncertain on if this plan b is going to work",

Plan C in my country would be a community college (provides 2 year associate's degree and preparation to complete the degree at a 4-year university).  Does your country have something similar?  If not, a gap year might be your final play unless you can emigrate or get an educational visa for a cheap college somewhere.  That's beyond my experience.",

I think we have something similar here but again doing A Levels here could easily substitute for an associate degree here. So idk if it make sense to do that.",

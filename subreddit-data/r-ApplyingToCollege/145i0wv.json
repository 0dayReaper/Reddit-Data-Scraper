If you are applying to CS you will be compared to other CS candidates (it would be difficult to compare to history majors as they have different ECs and awards). If all other CS candidates have Olympiad and research work and you don\u2019t, your application will pale in comparison.",

            "comment": "People say that ***some*** colleges don't admit by major.  Others, like UT Austin, do.  There's your answer.\n\nAs to why they admit by major:  because the ratio of applicants who want to major in CS/Business/Engineering is higher than the ratio of majors they can accommodate in those disciplines relative to \"everything else\".\n\nThat's changing, gradually, but it takes time.  You can only ramp so quickly without degrading the quality of your faculty, which UT is not willing to do.  It's also hard to downsize existing departments (e.g. English) where demand has decreased.  Essentially you get ***really***  picky with respect to hiring, to the point where you hire fewer new faculty (in that department) than you're losing due to attrition.",

By spring, CS and Engineering students with excellent profiles were getting waitlisted or admitted to the regional campuses.",

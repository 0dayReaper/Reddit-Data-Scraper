On this subreddit, you'll find many overachievers, so the population that is represented is not reflective of the rest of the county (the average SAT in the US is about 1070, but on this subreddit, when a student gets below 1500, that's seen as not enough). Because of the self-selecting process within college admissions\u2014and even for this subreddit\u2014it seems like everyone is obsessed with getting into these same 20 schools.\n\nStudents in districts or high schools where their peers end up at highly competitive schools are more likely to also pursue these same institutions, as it is very much a function of social networks/peer membership. When students live in close proximity to top universities, that, too, changes the college-going rates or college desires of local towns (though this might even be a function of fac students being at these very high schools, thereby skewing the pool once again). There are a lot of other sociological and policy factors that also lead to college desires and college-going rates!   \n\n\nETA: This was my research area in graduate school, so I was excited by the question!",

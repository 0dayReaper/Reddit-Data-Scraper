I'm curious about the difficulty level of the test and whether there are any additional resources or tips beyond the books and materials mentioned by \\[Caltech\\]([https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/documents/4722/Transfer\\_Entrance\\_Examinations\\_Book\\_List.pdf](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/documents/4722/Transfer_Entrance_Examinations_Book_List.pdf))Moreover, as an international resident, I'm wondering if it's possible to take the test remotely. If so, I'd love to hear from individuals who have already gone through the process and how they managed to take the test themselves.Your insights and experiences would be greatly appreciated! Please share any information or advice you may have regarding the difficulty of the Caltech transfer admissions test and the process of taking it, especially for international students.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm a rising junior struggling to find some target schools to apply to. Ideally every school (except for some safeties) that I am applying to should be in urban areas, or at least very walkable ones. I do not want to bring my car. I want to go into political science or urban planning.\n\nLil' stat run down:\n\nHome state: VA\n\nGPA: 3.8/4.1\n\nSAT: 1500ish, I'm still working on it\n\nI have pretty good ECs \n\nI'm hoping to apply to 12 schools and here is my current list:\n\n**Reaches:**\n\nColumbia (ED)\n\nBoston University\n\nGeorgetown\n\nUVA\n\n**Targets:**\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n\nGeorge Washington University\n\n**Safeties:**\n\nVCU\n\nJames Madison University\n\nTemple\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",

Sometimes a second look is warranted if weather, illness, holiday (no students), or a less-than-ideal tour guide potentially killed the vibe, but if you visited more than once you probably got a decent read.",

You will also need an official college transcript from your home institution and many schools also required LORs from professors at your home institution as well. You will also need to provide SAT and ACT scores too.",

Some schools allow you to apply in the fall to being in the spring, but that\u2019s not super common at top schools (and is generally a pathway more for sophomores than freshman) \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re an international student needing aid, transfer admissions is likely going to be even more difficult than first year admissions",

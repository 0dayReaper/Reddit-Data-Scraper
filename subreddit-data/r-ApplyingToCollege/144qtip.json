    "postText": "High school graduate in literally 2 days, I saw my final grade in econ. I have a D, and I only took 4 classes this year. so yeh. it's really effing bad. I already sent and email and left voicemail to the admissions office about it and currently waiting on a response on whether or not I can appeal and possibly retain my spot. \n\nRegardless, I'm just preparing myself for a rescind, so what should I do? I've already rejected other colleges and paid the deposit to the one I was planning on attending. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do if I really get rescinded. Do i just find a job and take a gap year and wait to just reapply to colleges?? ",

            "comment": "It would be unusual for a college to rescind without offering you a chance to explain yourself. Likely what will happen is the college will reach out and ask you to submit a written explanation for the decrease in your grades. They will then review your letter and make a decision.\n\nShould they decide NOT to rescind you, they might put you on academic probation as you enter college.\n\nShould they decide TO rescind you, you are...screwed. Call, email, show up in-person if you can to explain your situation. If nothing pans out, take another year and apply to colleges again or enroll in community college.\n\nIt is up to the college what they decide to do. Best of luck.",

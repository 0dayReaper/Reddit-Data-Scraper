    "postText": "Hi Everyone!\n\nNow I get the reaction the post title is going to get, as I used to think this way as well(\"I got 99 problems, and getting into a t20 or ivy is going to solve at least one of them\")\n\nYet, since summer is about to approach soon(and graduation as well!), I would just like to give my thoughts and experiences as a person who is on the other side of the college application process.\n\n**College is not worth sacrifising a social life over:** This part is probably my biggest regret throughout high school. From 9th grade, I started heavily grinding EC's and college prep so I could eventually \"make it\" somewhere respectable(which in my mind at the time was a t20/ivy level school)\n\nEven though I really enjoyed all of my EC's which I was and still really passionate about, I feel that my college grind completely destroyed any social life I had in high school due to the fact that I had no time to ever continue relationships outside of school in hanging-out, parties, etc.\n\nThis feeling started as soon as May hit and I committed to that said ivy. At first, I dismissed this feeling as just FOMO. After all, an ivy as the final result justified the means, right?\n\nYet, as I get closer to graduation, the painful realization starts to hit. Everyday in high school, I realize I never made any meaningful friendships/relationships which I can cherish later on in life. I realize I spent some of the golden young years in life lonely, miserable and sad. And when I finally graduate high school, I won't have any exciting or even happy experiences to draw back years down the line.\n\nI guess the moral of my story is this: please don't be blinded by the prestige or whatever label is put on certain colleges. I honestly believe I would have just done as well at a state school and been so much happier with a functional social life throughout my high school years. Yet, I'll take my lessons from high school and hopefully find my place in world at the Ivy I'm going to.\n\nTake care, and have a great summer!",

It's a big achievement, and you should be very proud of yourself for all the hard work you've put in over these past 4 years.\r\n\nSpeaking from someone who is 5 years out of college, don't consider high school to be your golden young years. I only stay in contact with one good friend, and most of my long-term friends were made in college.\n\nSince you're unable to get a do-over of high school and have regrets about your social life, use college as an opportunity to begin afresh and prioritize a bit more there. You still have A LOT of time left to form relationships and be part of a network / social group.\n\nBest wishes to you as you embark on the next chapter of your life!",

College will be a great time for you to reflect on the kind of life you want and to make new, meaningful friendships.\n\nI only keep in touch with a very small handful of friends from high school. Time just passes and people naturally drift. But I\u2019m still very close to many of my friends from college. \n\nIt\u2019s always good not to peak in high school anyways..",

I got into a few top schools ( blegh honestly any mention of prestige grosses me out these days) and while it was nice at first, the nice feelings only lasted so long. I have a lot of mental health issues and getting into a \"good\" college didnt change that. Some of thd comments are plain disgusting, yall need to step out yalls little a2c bubble and develop some, i dont know, empathy?!?!?",

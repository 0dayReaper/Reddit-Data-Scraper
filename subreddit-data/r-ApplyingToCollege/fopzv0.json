I pointed out UCLA because academic rigor and the prestige of the institution was never the reason why they outranked berkeley. They have fallen in rankings because of decreased funding in the past years and because of a misunderstanding in reporting alumni contributions. Reason why I pointed out that Berkeley\u2019s status of public school is because public schools cant rlly compete with privates in terms of resources, which is why berkeley is ranked so low. There is a reason why people claim uc berkeley as a public ivy. Believe it or not, the gap between ucsd and ucla is smaller thn the gap between ucla and uc berkeley if we are talking strictly in subject rankings.",

    "postText": "I've always loved learning languages, and I'd love to take that a step further with a languages degree. I've tried looking for universities that support online-only except for tests, but my options seem a little limited living in Ireland.\n\nThe degree has to be online, since I have to live at home due to the fact that I'm a beekeeper. If anyone knows any unis that support online learning in Ireland (other than the OU), i'd be extremely grateful to know which ones they are. Thanks!\n\n(BTW I wasn't sure which flair to pick. I hope this one's OK.)",

    "postText": "I already got one from an env science\\* teacher which I'm sure will be very solid.\n\nFor my other one, I unfortunately don't have the strongest connections with most teachers.\n\nMy cs teacher told us that she uses the same template for everyone. So probably not her.\n\nI've probably got one of the highest math grades that the teacher has ever seen. But that's basically about it and other than that, there is no substance.\n\nLeaning towards Lang beacuse he's known to write good rec letters that really focus on the person, and also feel like he may know me a bit more than other teachers from my writing, which I've always excelled on. On top of that, I'll have the same teacher for lit so should I wait till next year, try to be more active in class and ask then...? I just don't want him to forget all the stuff that happened this year... \n\n\\*Env science should meet the stem requirement for all schools right?\n\nSo should i stick with lang?",

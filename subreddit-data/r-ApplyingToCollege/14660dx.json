    "postText": "As a current UPenn Wharton dual degree engineering student, I am here to share an insight I\u2019ve picked up over my HS years creating my ED app that has helped me and other students navigate the last few months of the high-stress period in college applications. \n\nIt's the following two words: **\"Be ruthless.\"**\n\nWhat does it mean to be ruthless in this context? It comes down to your ability to say 'No' to things that don't matter and instead focus your time and energy on the things that do. I like Steve Jobs's quotes, \"Deciding what not to do is just as important as deciding what to do\" and, \"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.\"\n\nIn the months leading up to university applications, you will be swamped with assignments, tests, application forms, extracurriculars, and more. It's crucial to identify what among these is truly important and will contribute the most to your uni app success.\n\nFrom my observations, I (and other students I know) made the mistake of trying to do everything. Instead, identify the one to three tasks per day that yield the most results and prioritize THAT. **Time and attention are your most valuable resources,** and how you utilize them in these crucial months can make or break your college applications.\n\nFor instance, you might have some extracurricular activities that, despite the time and effort you put into them, do not contribute to your application. Stop doing these. Put all your time and effort into the tasks that the university admissions officer will notice and appreciate. Typically these are also easy tasks (e.g. going to a Science club meeting, with this meeting having no impact on how your AO reviews and looks at your app). Instead, focus on the hard but necessary tasks.\n\nSay 'No' to solicitations on your time that do not add value to your goals.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean you should never rest or explore your hobbies (this is high school). Rest and recovery are essential for high performance. All I'm saying is to be careful about what you say 'Yes' to and what you say 'No' to. And remember, once you get into your preferred university, you'll have plenty of time to enjoy all the things you may have \"missed out on\" (if you could even call it that).\n\nIn conclusion, stay ruthless with your time, priorities, and what you choose to say 'Yes' and 'No' to. **Focus on saying 'No' to unimportant things and that will give you the time to do the important things.** That's the difference between successful and unsuccessful students.\n\nSo, be ruthless, stay productive, and good luck with your college applications. Let me know if you have any Qs, I'm happy to help.",

    "postText": "Hello, this is my first time posting here, hoping I would get some advice on french art universities. Currently, I just finished the 10th grade and I am going to 11th grade in highschool in 3 months. My future dream or plan is to study art in France, for several reasons which are\n\n\\- Low cost compared to the UK or canadian universities\n\n\\- The country itself has a great history of art and I believe they support art to a great extent, and I'm fascinated by that\n\n\\- I'm interested in their culture, language and etc.\n\nHowever, eventhough I've researched TONS and TONS the informations are very scattered regarding unis in France for art. I am willing to improve my French up till level B2 during my remaining highschool years, along with building more background in art and participating in competitions at my school, etc.\n\nBut, I wonder what is the reality, the actual steps of getting into a French public art university, and I want to gather more precise information, some of my questions are\n\n**- can you get into the art universities by just a highschool dipolma? I heard that the local French citizens have to obtain a baccalaur\u00e9at, is that the equivalent to a highschool diploma outside of EU?**\n\n**- Are there also great universities outside of Paris? I heard that Paris is a very hard place to live in (costs and stuff)**\n\n**- what are some decent art universities in France (maybe a list)?**\n\nIf there's anyone who's willing to talk about their experience, or any advice in general regarding this topic I would appreciate you a lot :') Honestly, I am bit panicking about my future path as around myself, I'm the only one who wants to go on with studying art seriously while others are more into.. according to them \"stable\" ways. I've been citisized for wanting to study art, but it is my passion afterall and I don't want to demotivate myself in life by spending a long time studying something that I don't like.",

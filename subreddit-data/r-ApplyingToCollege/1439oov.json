They specifically make u start ur application on Commonapp, then make you continue on their own platform, only taking ur info and personal statement.\n\n Then most people don't go through with their application because there are 3 tests to complete. And even if you don't try the tests you still get a rejection just for doing the first step on Commonapp lol.\n\n0.9% acceptance rate was the funniest shit I've seen in ages",

A non-audition program like most state schools (safeties) doesn\u2019t appeal, but everything with auditions seems insanely competitive and a \u201creach\u201d. Wanting to double major in a LA study or do a joint program complicates things.

You don\u2019t apply to the university as a whole, you apply to a specific program within that university and that\u2019s where the acceptance rates really differ. Waterloo, for example, has a published general acceptance rate of 53%, but looking at their computer science program, their acceptance rate is at 4.3%\u2014lower than the majority of Ivy League schools.",

So Engineering/Law double degree at a prestigious university might have a 95+ ATAR cutoff, while nursing at the same university might have an 80 cutoff, and very obscure Arts major might have a 70. Scores tend to cluster across courses (ie all medicine programs are pretty much 99+ across all universities) but the desirability of the university itself can push entrance scores up too.",

The regional admissions person told the crowd to only submit standardized test scores if they were at the prior year\u2019s 75th percentile or higher for admitted students (IIRC the 75th percentile was 1490 for their 2026 class). The guidance usually is to submit if the score is near the 50th percentile. However, I also heard some schools advise to submit if you\u2019re in the 25th to 75th range (or above).",

My guess? Most schools lie, but Columbia was the only one caught with their pants down (also, because columbia is largely known for its activist culture over most things, take that how you will). FinAid is roughly the same, and Endowment is a little less, but this could be attributed to the fact that Columbia is buying large swaths of NY land aggressively (and CU endowment is still stupid high), class sizes are basically the same (8-20 for all three, except Princeton which trends a little lower, tho class sizes at this level are not nessacarily the best indicator of \"best\"), Proffesor quality is the same (lol), and quality of life is subjective (you like big cities, medium cities, or suburbs; NY is the subjective greatest city in the US, New Haven has a worse crime rate than NY, and nothing ever happens in Princeton).",

It\u2019s still there in the CDS for anyone to see. Also, Pomona still requires a couple of supplemental essays, has an app fee, and doesn\u2019t consider legacy, so if anything, its admit rate is higher than it would be if it did engage in all that stuff (so congratulations for getting in!).",

Berkeley is 15%, which might seem at least mostly on track, but UCLA is 11%.  UCLA being lower than Berkeley and nearly half of the other long-recognized top \"national\" publics suggests to me a volume effect.\n\nOK, then Minnesota is 73%, Purdue is 69%, Wisconsin is 60%, Illinois 60%, Ohio State 57%, Maryland 52%, Georgia 40%, but Santa Barbara is 29%, Irvine 29% . . . .  For that matter, Texas is \"only\" 29%.  I'd say it is an important reality that some of the UC schools after Berkeley and UCLA are now peers of very good \"flagship\" universities, but still I think having like half the acceptance rate of what I would consider at least peer flagships is only explainable with volume effects.\n\nI'd also use this opportunity to note that I think a reverse volume effect typically happens to Midwestern schools.  Indeed, I'd personally say schools like Wisconsin and Illinois are really peers of Texas, and a bit more \"prestigious\" in that sense then the third-tier Cal schools, or a school like Georgia.  So to me, their 60% acceptance rates seem low.  And then Minnesota is like way low.  Probably a Midwest PLUS \"eek, snow!\" effect to that one.",

California is one of the largest economies and with tech hubs &amp; huge education oriented immigrant population makes for highly educated student population compared to Midwest. One reason for what one thinks as discrepancy compared to midwest schools, UCs are more all rounded i.e across multiple fields. Irvine, for instance, has nearly 2Billion dollar medical center attached. Most on A2C are focused on CS and thus surprised when their school does not have overall high rank.",

Reason why selectivity plays an important role (and why most whine about various ranking systems) is that most of your peers in UC classroom has high school unweighted 3.95 GPA or higher. This makes for a very competitive classroom compared to schools where students are mostly mid 3 gpa range.

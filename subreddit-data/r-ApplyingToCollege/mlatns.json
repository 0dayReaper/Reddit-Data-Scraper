It's been a long journey filled with ups and downs, but we made it! Thank you so much to everyone for your support, and I am truly honored to have joined all of you on our college application journey. When I first started doing this, I would receive quite a few downvotes and messages telling me to stop, so I'm still in shock that I am receiving this much support.\n\nRegardless of what happens tonight, please know that each and every one of you is unique and amazing and talented and loved. At the end of the day, you are in control of your future and don\u2019t let anything get in the way of that.\n\nGood luck to everyone! See you on the other side\ud83c\udfde\ud83d\ude0a\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Am I seeing the awards right?\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a",

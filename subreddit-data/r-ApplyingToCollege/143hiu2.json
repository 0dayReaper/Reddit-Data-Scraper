    "postText": "For example, I was planning to take AP Calc next year after completing Calc 1 (and possibly Calc 2) at my local CC but our college counselor said that I don\u2019t have to because the grade in the college course provides the same \u201cproof\u201d of knowledge that an AP score does. My only worry is that I\u2019m applying to a lot of OOS universities (such as the UCs) and that AP scores are better to show than college courses since they\u2019re more standardized. \n\nI did reach out to UC admissions (uci in particular) and they just said they can\u2019t say for sure if the courses will transfer but if the course descriptions are the same they likely will.",

So an AP exam score can provide some certainly.\n\nFor something like Calculus, it\u2019s \u201clikely\u201d, as you found, that you would receive placement/credit. But you might not find out until after being admitted. Unfortunately.\n\nSome schools publish transfer policies. My daughter was able to determine what, in advance, would transfer to Purdue, in terms of both credit and placement -  [https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bzwtxcrd.p\\_select\\_info](https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bzwtxcrd.p_select_info)\n\nSee if schools that interest you have th pe same.

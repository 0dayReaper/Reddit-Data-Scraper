    "postText": "There's no dedicated \"Why Major\" essay for the UCs, but should we write an essay that'll explain exactly why we want to pursue the major that we're applying for?\n\n  \nMy ECs obviously reflect that I want to pursue CS, but since the UCs do take major into account (especially for schools like Berkeley) do I need to emphasize why I'm a good fit particularly for those departments?",

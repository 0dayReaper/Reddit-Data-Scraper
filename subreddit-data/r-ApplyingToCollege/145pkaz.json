    "postText": "So for some back story my mom is one of the guidance counselors at my private highschool so they all have known me for pretty much my whole life so one of them was talking to me the other day about what I should write about but I am a bit on the fence. So me and my family (mom dad  both educators I was a freshman when it started my sisters were in sixth and fourth) we lived in a 3 bed 2 bath house in a decently wealthy neighborhood and started a major renovation to our house. To make a very long story semi short the project took way longer than it was supposed to it was supposed to go from September 2021 to March 2022 and ended up ending in January 2023. The originally contractor stopped sending guys to the house even after we paid him and is getting sued by us and all of his other clients for the same reason. He also left faulty electrical wiring in our walls which was very dangerous. During this time it was really isolating because I couldn\u2019t see my friends as often because we lived with my grandparents about 20 minutes away from my town. I also started highschool a week before we left and went to a different one then all my friends and we were living in someone else\u2019s house. I am on the fence about writing about this for a few reasons, even though mentally it was probably one of the lowest points in my life I don\u2019t think I could articulate that in a constructive way. I just think it\u2019s also kinda pretentious because I was living in my grandparents pretty nice house while we were pretty much completely redoing ours. I know it\u2019s a pretty unique experience but I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s right for an essay please let me know your thoughts below.",

            "comment": "This is just my thought, feel free to agree or disagree, but I think you shouldn\u2019t write about this entire event. Maybe focus on a smaller, more certain aspect of it, like how this scenario affected your friendships/social life, and how you overcame it. This might not be the best example, but you could definitely take a small handful of the story and nurture it to something else to highlight your characteristics.",

But even you don\u2019t sound that interested is that.\n  \nFundamentally you want the reader to get to the end and think \u201cwow what an interesting and likable person- they\u2019d maybe a great addition to our community\u201d. Will this idea get you that essay?",

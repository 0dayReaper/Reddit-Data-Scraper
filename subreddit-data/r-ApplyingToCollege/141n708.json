    "postText": "during middle school i took a few hs level math classes since i started off in elementary in the \"gifted\" program. however, i got a couple Bs in those math classes because i never cared to study. i feel this definitely doesn't reflect my work now, but it's weighing down on the gpa on my transcript. would i be able to mention this in my applications anywhere? ... without making it sound like a lame excuse? i don't know if this is a valid reason anyway, but i truly believe my middle school self is not at all the person i am today, at least academically/work-ethic wise \ud83e\udd72 but it's coming back and biting me in the butt now",

It is only your grade 9/10/11/12 grades that matter, with grades 10 and 11 weighted most heavily. Of course you as a college applicant bare little resemblance to you as a 13 year old! \n\nA few Bs also aren\u2019t the end of the world.",

I just think your progression should speak for itself though. Keep your momentum going and focus on what you can do going forward.",

One or two Bs is not a deciding factor in admissions and if it isn\u2019t part of your grade 9/10/11/12 class work, it isn\u2019t going to be considered anyway. No school cares what classes you took in middle school.",

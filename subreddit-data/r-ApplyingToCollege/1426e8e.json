    "postText": "I am trying to compose an email to someone who works at the local chamber of commerce to ask if they\u2019d be willing to meet for an informational interview. I have only met them once previously, but we hit it off quite well and she told me to reach out to her whenever. I\u2019d love some feedback on the email content + it\u2019s formality.\n\n\nDear Ms._____,\n\nMy name is _____, and I am a junior at ________ High School. I do not know if you remember me, but we met during the Career Fair at ________ High School a few months ago, where we talked briefly about my interest in Political Science.\n\nI am hoping you might have 15 to 30 minutes to meet with me sometime in the coming weeks. I would greatly appreciate an opportunity to ask some questions about your experience majoring in Political Science that I did not get the chance to ask at the event. Please let me know if this might be possible and what dates and times are most convenient for you.\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you.\n\nSincerely,\n\n________\nPhone: (___) ____ - ____",

    "postText": "Title basically.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nHi there, I'm an international student who applied to like some of the top colleges last year \\[for Fall 2023\\] like HYPSM, Duke, Ivy League etc. But the issue is I did it under parental pressure, less than two weeks before the college deadlines in like mid-December 2022 while I had health issues and was really sleep-deprived and went test-optional. Everything except my grades and my LORs (thanks to my lovely teachers) was mediocre at best. I'd have probably been the laughing stock in admissions offices in the colleges.\r  \n\r  \nUnsurprisingly, I got my ass handed to me with only rejections. Now that I'm prepared and want to apply for Fall 2024, I feel like if the Admissions Officers were to view my file and compare it to my previous application, it'd feel like either I used external help or was a completely different person or probably get flagged for lying or something.\r  \n\r  \nMy point, is there's a massive difference in the quality of my app \\[for 2024\\] compared to 2023 (international awards, much better essays, impactful ECs that I forgot to mention last year, 36 ACT etc.) Feels like a completely different applicant.\r  \n\r  \nSo, will I get screwed over?\r  \n\r  \nEspecially when HYP ask if I've applied previously and look at my 2023 file.",

The transcript that got you rejected before is unchanged \u2014 and those few schools are unmoved by a 36. \n\nAdmissions officers will see your previous application when they consider your new one. In some cases, they may be specifically interested in what you\u2019ve done with your year in between the two rounds of applications. It\u2019s easy for you to assume a \u201cmassive difference\u201d in the quality of your new app, and it probably feels comforting to think that, but you should be aware that they may not see it that way.",

I legit put like one local award and two ECs cause of sleep-deprivation.\n\nWhen in reality, I had pretty good ECs, like internships, research and international Olympiad awards. I feel like the admissions officers are either going to think I'm lying or make tons of calls to my counselor calling him to verify stuff. There's just a drastic difference between my current and previous app.",

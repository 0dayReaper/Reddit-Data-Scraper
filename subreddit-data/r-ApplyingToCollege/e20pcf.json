    "postText": "**The \"metaphor\" essay**\n\nIf you really think about it, life is exactly like a burrito. We all hide our true selves from the world with a wrapped-up covering. But inside, we host a plethora of fascinating offerings: cheese, rice, beans, chicken, and so much more. Inside my own burrito, I have my artistic eye and my caring heart. Those might constitute my beans and cheese. But someone else's cheese might be their love of surfing or their ability to speak ten languages. In conclusion, we should all unwrap our burritos and let the rice and beans spill out into a messy pile.\n\n**The quirky, \"outside of the box\" essay**\n\ni   a m APPLICANT\n\nu    a r e ADMISSIONS OFFICER\n\np   l e   as e l et        m e      IN\n\n**The sports injury essay**\n\nIt was the day of the big game. I had been preparing my whole life to play on that field that day. Sweat dripped down my face as I ran the warmup laps with my team. Suddenly I felt a horrible pain in my leg and I realized that I had stubbed my toe. \"NO!\" I gasped. \"Not on the day of the big game!\"\n\nCoach looked solemnly at me. \"Your career is over,\" he said. \"You can't play in the big game now.\"\n\nSuddenly his phone rang. He picked it up and frowned with concern. \"Oh no! Our star player has just come down with the flu and won't be able to play. Now we don't have enough players for the big game. We're going to have to forfeit.\"\n\nA burst of adrenaline coursed through my veins. \"No, we won't,\" I said, standing up resolutely. \"I'm going to play.\"\n\nCoach looked at me in awe.\n\nThat game I played like I had never played before, fighting through my agony for the team. Despite the unimaginable pain of my toe, I found it in me to score the winning goal. As I held the golden trophy above my head, I proudly realized that my hard work had gotten me here. Because, as Abraham Lincoln always said, winners never quit.\n\n**The \"thesaurus\" essay**\n\nI cherish to acquire comprehension in school, thus perusing volumes is my preoccupation. My incarnation is blithesome because I am disclosing new atmospheres and modes of quintessence. This scintillating diversion alleviates all malaises and obfuscations through elucidation. Whereas herein lies my denouement: construing utilization is my zeal.\n\n**The sob story essay**\n\nMy life was never easy. I was born at a very young age, and was immediately plunged into hardship. I should have had a 4.9 GPA, however my numerous struggles have understandably resulted in my 1.7 GPA.\n\nIt all started with a birthday gift of AirPods. Unfortunately I received them just a week before the new AirPods 3 came out and everyone noticed my old-model AirPods and called me broke. Dear reader, the only thing broke was my heart. I couldn't even activate Siri with my model. However, I dusted myself off and trudged onwards. The next obstacle would be the one to shoot down my dreams. I had long hoped to launch a successful career as an Instagram influencer. With high hopes and my heart in my throat, I posted a selfie. To my horror, it received a measly 3 likes. This has wounded my spirit irreparably and I have since been struggling to cope. Obviously schoolwork has had to wait while I turn my attention to dealing with my greater problems.\n\n**The overly descriptive essay**\n\nAt 6:35 am, I wake up and look at the lavender shade of my walls - not quite blue, not quite pink - and breathe in deeply. If my room were a clock, I have a periodic table poster above my closet at 3 o'clock, a world map slightly to the right of my desk at 9 o'clock, and a certificate for my work in cancer research at 11 o'clock. As I get up, I am aware of the white paint on my door and the soft fluff of my beige rug. Today is a cold day, about 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18.3333 degrees Celsius. I slip on my puffy green winter jacket and my bright red Nikes and step outside onto the cracked gray sidewalk. As I walk, I glance at a small brown squirrel darting across the long black power line. Soon it is time for school, where I will fill my inquisitive mind with knowledge and apply my bountiful observational skills.\n\n**The inspirational service trip essay**\n\nThrough my service trip to \\[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\\], I learned that helping others is good. This led to the realization that service is my passion. That is why I will be perfect for helping others by being a doctor/lawyer/CS programmer. As soon as I arrived in a poorer country with my $2,500 summer program, I started to miss the clean streets of my Silicon Valley neighborhood. But I took pictures with local children and followed my tour group around, so now I know just what it means to dedicate oneself to service. Here's the funny thing: I went to \\[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\\] to help others, but what I didn't know is that they had helped me. Due to the five days that I spent in \\[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\\] I have become more caring and aware and humble. These are all qualities that I will bring to the UC Hicago/St. Anford campus.\n\n**The \"intellectual curiosity\" essay**\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have always asked \"why?\" to everyone around me. As a child, I practically lived in libraries, carrying wagons of encyclopedias home every night. I blew through sixty books a day, and even that wasn't enough for my thicc brain. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that could never be satisfied, not by Einstein's treatises on relativity, not by the Feynman physics lectures. By the age of three, I was writing academic papers with my crayons. In conclusion, I have am quite a curious intellectual. Harvard, please let me in.\n\nedit: i had no idea that this would blow up so much, thank you so much to everyone for being so kind! + thanks for all your support \u2764\ufe0f\n\nedit 2: omg why did this become the #5 most upvoted post of all time in r/ApplyingToCollege thanks guys!",

                    "comment": "Wanted to piggyback on this comment to just share some advice for if your essay sounds dangerously close to one of these.  This is actually such a great way to show the common mistakes people make when they write their essays.\n\n- Think about if your essay actually a. answers the question b. is mostly about answering the question c. is very clear on answering the question. AOs don't  have too long to read your essay, and if your essay doesn't do what it's supposed to do, or does it in a convoluted or long winded way, they're not going to spend extra time trying to understand how a burrito is somehow related to your life. Your job is to make their job easier. Keep it clear, concise, and readable.\n\n- Shift the focus from your story to your reflection of that experience. Let's say you're going to talk about a hardship you overcame. People talk about if 'sob stories' are a bad thing to write about- and yes they are, if you only write about the sob story itself. What did you learn from it? How did you better yourself with that knowledge, and maybe how did you better your community? What more are you going to do with that knowledge in the future? These questions are infinitely more important than the description of your hardship itself.\n\n- Stop worrying about the style of your essay and just answer the question! A lot of people get stuck on the idea of if their essay should have narration or flowery language in it, just because they've seen a lot of other essays with that kind of style. If that's your style- go for it! Otherwise, trying out a new style often leads to essays that sound a lot like these- cliche, confusing, and oftentimes a waste of time. Write your essay in the way that feels most comfortable to you first, and maybe afterwards you can see if you want to add any stylistic elements to it. The content of your essay is much more important than your syle.",

Gary was there. Gary was my shithead cousin who was two years younger than me. He was a rather a short boy with clammy skin and mousy brown hair. He ran over to me and cried, \u201cPeachy! I wanna play Pok\u00e9mon Shield! Play with me!\u201d\n\nI sighed, what a juvenile. I plastered on a fake smile and  replied with a shaking voice, \u201cfuck no, I don\u2019t play trash games. Gen 1  4 life.\u201d\n\nHe shrieked, \u201cYou said a bad word! I\u2019m telling auntie and mummy!\u201d Gary, with a malevolent grin on his face, bounced over to the kitchen where my mother was making ethnic^T^M food. She shaped the Puri wit such love and care. With the slight of her hand, she turned a stodgy dough ball into a poofy pillow. \n\nI heard angry footsteps stomping out of the kitchen.\n\n\u201cPEACHY!\u201d\n\nI flinched. Darn it. He was even going to ruin my birthday.\n\n\nMy mother scowled, \u201cDon\u2019t say that! One more time and you\u2019re going to your room.\u201d\n\n\nI rolled my eyes, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\nGary\u2019s smirk made my blood heat to a rolling boil. \n\nI restrained myself. This day, this momentous day, was not going to be ruined by some snot-nosed brat with a penchant to snitch.\n\nI motioned for him to come over: \u201cOk! I\u2019ll play with you!\u201d\n\nWe played for a few hours and every family member began to enter the house.\n\nWe cut my red velvet cake and began to open my presents. I loved everything. From paintbrushes to sketchbooks to an American girl doll- I loved every gift.\n\nAll was going well.\n\nI, with a jovial smile on my face, carefully peeled the tape from the last gift. It was carefully wrapped with a confetti pattern plastered all over.\n\n\u201cA gameboy!\u201d\n\nI smiled and thanked the gifter profusely. \n\nI felt a slight tug on my prize.\n\n\u201cI-I want it. I want that.\u201d\n\nMy eyes met Gary\u2019s. He was beginning to tear up.\n\nMy mom pulled me aside. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. Let him have it for a little while.\u201d\n\nI gritted my teeth and obliged.\n\nThe little gremlin played with it for the rest of the day, not even allowing me to touch it.\n\nI heard my dad\u2019s thunderous snoring and an idea hit me.\n\nI tiptoed to my parents\u2019 room, my heart pounding.\n\nWith shaking fingers, I clicked open the box in the corner of their closet.\n\nI took hold of the object in it and concealed in my pretty party dress.\n\nPerfect. Gary was all alone.\n\nI took control of the object\u2019s black handle and pressed almost clicked the trigger.\n\nThe \u201cobject\u201d was my father\u2019s pistol with a silencer, a weapon he closely guarded. \n\nI pressed it to Gary\u2019s head and fired.\n\nThe impact threw me backwards and I tiptoed back to my parents\u2019 room to return the weapon.\n\nWith a bounce in my step, I got into bed and drifted off.\n\n\u201cI wonder who\u2019ll find him?\u201d I thought right before my exhaustion took over my brain.\n\n\nThis killing of Gary shows my ability to overcome any obstacle creatively. Any other kid would have sucked it\nup and eventually would have lost what they wanted. But not me.\u201d",

They may sound really smart and insightful at 2 in the morning, but I would bet a substantial amount of money that whoever is reading your essay has likely seen said metaphor before, or one incredibly similar to it. Also, they come off as incredibly lazy. Instead of using a metaphor, just make a comparison. If Y seems like X, then just say that, while highlighting how and, more importantly, why that matters. Metaphors can also be distracting to the reader, especially if it is an outlandish metaphor. You really don't want the reader to be pondering your metaphor instead of focusing on your writing. And then there is the possibility that they do not understand, or misunderstand, your metaphor; therefore derailing or disrupting whatever argument or point that you are trying to make.\n\nTl;dr Metaphors are lazy and potentially harmful to your cause. Instead, concisely and logically lay out the exact point you are trying to make.",

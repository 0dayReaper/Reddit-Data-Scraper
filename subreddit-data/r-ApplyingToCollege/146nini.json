    "postText": "If I stick to my current senior year course registration, I\u2019ll have completed all the APs offered at my school except for AP Euro. I could fit AP Euro into my schedule, but I would have to drop one of the two dual enrollment math courses that I signed up for. I would slightly prefer to take the math course, but I\u2019m perfectly fine with Euro, and it would be way easier than the math course. My biggest concern is that I don\u2019t want my STEM-focused course selection to be frowned upon by admissions officers, particularly those at core curriculum schools where humanities is a major part of the curriculum, even for STEM majors. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

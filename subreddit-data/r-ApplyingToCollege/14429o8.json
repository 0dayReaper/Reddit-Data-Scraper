    "postText": "I have shifted schools and went to a very prestigious private school for 8th, 9th and 10th grade. Then, to a small unknown school for 11th and 12th. I guess it's also worth mentioning that I'm an international student. \n\nI was a bit of a trouble maker in the first school and am skeptical about asking them for an lor.\n\nWill it be alright if I only have lors from my second school (principal+ teacher) and a supplemental or will that raise red flags?",

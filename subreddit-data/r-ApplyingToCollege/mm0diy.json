    "postText": "In my mind, Dartmouth seemed like the perfect fit for me, from its D-Plan to the heavy undergraduate focus to the Outing Club. But of course, not everything turns out the way you want it to. Thank you Dartmouth for taking the time to consider my application and read through everything I sent. You will always hold a special place in my heart. Maybe I'll apply again for graduate school :)\n\nSince many people have been asking where I ended up: I remember pretty vividly a few weeks ago someone wrote that a previous Yale Simp ended up at Dartmouth, so the reverse could possibly happen with me. Well...here we are. It looks like I will be simping for Yale for the next 4 years!\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73 I am forever grateful to Yale for giving a chance to an Asian male with subpar stats and no national awards. I am still in shock that I was accepted and will likely remain that way for the next few months.\n\nCongrats to everyone who got into their dream schools, and for those who were not as lucky, please remember that you are talented and amazing and at the end of the day your college has little to no control over where you will be in 10 years. You will all be going on to do amazing things regardless of where you end up!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cDartmouthSimp Out\u201d\n\n^(On a side note, it seems like people are somehow saying that I am a girl now. I don't know if this is because I used Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" as my final song, but I've used he/him in many of my comments.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: THANK YOU FOR ALL THE AWARDS AND SUPPORT!! I WILL 100% TAKE A2C WITH ME TO YALE!!",

Dartmouth saw something in me and gave me a chance and I was so so happy to be there for the next 4 years. Thinking back on my years there always leaves a fuzzy feeling inside and now I honestly can't imagine a college life for me at Yale.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm sure you'll positively love Yale the same way that I love Dartmouth even though it was barely on my radar when I applied. I'm sure the feeling of rejection sucks, but I know you'll feel amazing these next 4 years regardless.",

Just wanted to say that I applaud your courage for putting your hopes and aspirations out on this forum for everyone to see \u2013 when I applied to college a year ago, I didn\u2019t tell anyone except my immediate family where I had applied, because I didn\u2019t want anyone (including myself!) to have unrealistic expectations for my success in what was essentially an admissions crapshoot. While I\u2019m still sort of glad that I didn\u2019t internally or publicly tie my identity to any particular school, the downside of not sharing my goals with any of my friends was that the college admissions process felt very isolating. So a big kudos to you for having the self-assurance to do something I could never do. That said, as a no-national-awards-average-Asian-female who was accepted to Yale in 2020, I can probably relate to how you must be feeling right now! I hope to see you on campus in the fall, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions  \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73",

At cornell i joined a freestyle rap club that had future neurosurgeons architects and food scientists in it, and frankly my public speaking improved vastly from the pressure of judgement and performance. Intramural Sports, volunteering events, and even local out of college events that are in the surrounding areas are all there to enrich you. These next few years you will be in your physiological prime, being able to eat anything sleep very little or study all night. These traits will waver over time, so carpe the diem. Remember, the true currency of life is experiences and relationships. Make some friends and hold onto em. Youll do great",

I hope all goes as well as possible for you in your next four years. \n\nI do have to say though, you mentioning Dartmouth\u2019s Outing Club reminded me that I have an obligation to remind everyone that while Dartmouth has claimed to have the oldest outing club of any university in the country for a while now, a few years back my alma mater, St. Lawrence University, contested this and produced documents proving that WE actually hold that honor. So suck it Dartmouth, can\u2019t get anything right it seems, between the OC and not accepting this future Yale grad. I wish you all the best, stranger :)",

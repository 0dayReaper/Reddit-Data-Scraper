It's also suggested to send if all score breakdowns begin with 7s for both SATs and 3s for ACT no matter what the total score is and where it lies.\n\nBetween 25 and 50% consider submitting based on how it plays within your high school/environment. For example, if your score is between 25th and 50th percentile for a college, but it\u2019s in the top 75% for your high school, then it's good to submit. Colleges will look at the context of your background and educational experiences.\n\nOn the common data set you can see the breakdown for individual scores. Where do your scores lie? And what\u2019s your potential major? That all has to be part of the equation too.\n\nIt probably isn't good to submit if it\u2019s below the 25% of a college unless your score is tippy top for your high school.\n\nYou can find out if a school is test-optional by looking at their website or searching on https://www.fairtest.org.\n\nYou can find the common data set to see where your test scores fall by googling common data set and your college's name.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

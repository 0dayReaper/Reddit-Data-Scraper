    "postText": "So I am a rising senior and am extremely nervous about my upcoming apps. I have had my heart set on one college that is a top 10 but another college is a top 25 that I have a slightly better shot of getting into. Should I ED at the top 10 and lessen my chances of getting into the top 25 or ED at the latter. I hope that made sense lol.",

If you like both colleges similarly, albeit the T10 a tiny bit more, just ED to the T25. You\u2019ll be happy there, and although you might still wish you went to the T10, you\u2019ll still be in a place you love.",

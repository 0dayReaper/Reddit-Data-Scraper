    "postText": "I was recently talking with my school counselor and when she saw my EC list she was like \"damn do you even touch grass\" \ud83d\ude2d\n\nBut I feel like it might be a valid concern bc I have a lot of \"basic\" high-achieving ECs and awards. Like VERY overdone (valedictorian, paid tech internship, prestigious summer camp, state school research, multiple leadership at existing nonprofits, president of multiple clubs, aime, usaco plat, etc) but would they reject a profile that looks like it was optimized for college apps? And is yield protection an actual worry?",

The second is definitely a possibility that almost all students are victim of to some extent, but your essays are your time to create a cohesive narrative that shows the authenticity behind what you do.",

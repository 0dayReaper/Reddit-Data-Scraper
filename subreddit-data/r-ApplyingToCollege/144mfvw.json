But can we give props to one public school that hasn\u2019t raised tuition in 12+ years? Purdue is going on 12 years without an increase. OOS tuition is 28k and instate is 10k. How is it that no other public university is able to achieve this? This proves it can be done\u2026",

I'm just waiting for colleges to announce when COA will be $100K a year.",

You have the option of agreeing to my offer or walking away.  Or, if you don't like that I don't charge everyone the same rate, you can just preemptively walk away.\n\nBut you want that ***sweet, sweet prestige***, so I have you over a barrel.\n\nUniversities are businesses, essentially.  They want to assemble the \"best\" class, both academically and along certain diversity vectors.  Charging everyone the same price is a ***sub-optimal strategy*** for achieving that goals.\n\nAny time you charge a student less than he *would have* been willing to pay you're leaving money on the table.  That's money that could be used for any of number of purposes that would make your university and make it possible for you to attract more/better students.  It could be used to:\n\n* pay your faculty and grad students more\n* take less money out of your endowment, which allows it to grow more rapidly\n* improve your facilities (dorms, cafeterias, classrooms, etc.)\n* attract \"better\" students by tactically deploying financial aid\n* attract \"better\" students by tactically deploying \"merit\" based aid\n* hire more admissions staff to travel around the country getting HS students more interested in your school",

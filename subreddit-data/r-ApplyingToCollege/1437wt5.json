Instead, rational employers would take that information in combination with things like the specific classes and such they took (aka their \"course\"), and their relative performance in their course.  To normalize evaluations of performance, employers might rationally factor in the estimated competition different applicants faced.  And in turn things like the selection process for that course might be an input into such competition estimates.\n\nOK, so there is often a correlation between course selectivity measures and course reputational measures, and this explains why.\n\nBut, it would not be rational for employers to simply look across an entire school and impute to every single applicant from that school a boost due to some generic school reputation.\n\nInstead, rational employers will look at applicants individually based on course and performance, and then use whatever selectivity information is most relevant to normalizing performance.",

                                    "comment": "So I don't think there is a clear advantage either way, but for the record . . .\n\nIn the US system, graduates of the most selective colleges typically get broader educations than bachelors-level graduates of the most selective UK universities, and the latter get typically get deeper educations in their specific program (aka course).  Again, which is \"better\" isn't a question with a meaningful answer, it just depends.\n\nAlong with that structure comes the fact that admissions to the most selective US colleges are usually \"holistic\", whereas as for UK universities they are very focused on academic qualifications for that specific course.  Again, which is \"better\" isn't a meaningful question, as each admissions system makes sense in context.\n\nFinally, it may be worth noting that the UK higher education system is much smaller than the US higher education system, and yet the most selective universities in the UK are mostly on the large size by US standards, at least holding aside our top public universities.  Although of course in the UK these most selective universities basically ARE a form of public university, and the private university model that dominates the US most selective universities list basically doesn't meaningfully exist in the UK.  Nor, for that matter, does the UK have the equivalent of the US's most selective \"liberal arts colleges\".  Again, which is \"better\" isn't a meaningful question, each system makes sense in context.\n\nOK, so inherently any comparison of the most selective colleges (either university-located or separate liberal arts colleges) in the US to the most selective universities in the UK is an apples to oranges comparison as the systems are different, and that means the schools are different, and that all means the admissions are different.\n\nStill, just numerically--I believe Oxford and Cambridge enroll about 1.2% of the UK's total bachelors' level full-time students.  To get to a similar fraction of the comparable student population in the US, you need something like all 8 of the Ivy League colleges, the other 7 or so private colleges at the research universities sometimes known as Ivy Plus, and probably a handful of the top liberal arts colleges as well.\n\nAnd even then, a bunch of those students are \"hooked\" in ways not relevant to Oxbridge (such as being recruited athletes).  So for UNhooked students specifically, you'd have to go even deeper into the US list of most selective colleges to get to a comparable fraction to Oxbridge.\n\nAgain, these are different systems, so the \"top\" students in the UK (even holding aside \"hooks\") are not necessarily the same as the \"top\" students in the US anyway.  But generally speaking, I think most people familiar with all this acknowledge that it is at least as \"hard\", if not harder, for an academically strong but unhooked candidate to get into any of those 18-20 \"top\" colleges in the US as it is to get into \"Oxbridge\" as an undergraduate.  And significantly harder for such an applicant to get into \"HYPSM\" specifically.  Again understanding there are going to be some individual applicants like that (academically strong but unhooked) who are a better fit for one system or the other.\n\nAs to how that affects the perceived value of the bachelors' level degrees granted by these schools--again, I think that just depends.",

And the faculty in that course decide who to admit, and they have absolutely no mandate to admit athletes, or anything other than the applicants who they think best fit that specific course.",

    "postText": "How do you make an effective college lists with safeties, targets, and reaches? Don\u2019t know where to place my scores and grades amongst the different college baselines (common data set). My test scores vs. grades are too inconsistent with each other. Need some advice on a good baseline for me to start piecing together which colleges will fit my academic scores.\n\nIntended Major: Anything in the business field (Business admin, economics, marketing), but also am interested in political science and public policy.\n\nCumulative unweighted 3.869\nCumulative unweighted 4.23\nSAT#1 - 1300 (Eng - 640) (Math - 660)\nSAT#2 - 1330 (Eng - 580) (Math - 750) \n\nAlso have taken 4 APs one 5, the rest TBD. \n\nI\u2019m gonna take the SAT one more time, and try to super score. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!!! Thanks",

I would say as long as you have 1-3 solid safety schools you would like to and have the means to attend if accepted, the rest of your list should be wherever you wanna go regardless of acceptance rate, and doing your best on the application itself.",

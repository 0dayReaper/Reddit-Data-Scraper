    "postText": "This was inspired by someone here asking if admissions officers would recommend publishing a book of history essays. Since lots of students seem eager to publish, I thought it might be useful to look at it from a publishers' angle. I'm an editor at a university press with a part-time teaching position in the humanities, so I have some strong feelings about this. (I  focus on humanities and social science books, so maybe it's different for scientific articles.)\n\nPublish or perish is for professors, not for high school students. The whole publishing research as a high school kid to get into college\u2013thing has gotten out of control.  \nAnything you could possibly write now as a high school student, will be better after you have been involved in higher education\u2014once you have actually taken real university courses by experts in the field, done research in university libraries and legitimate archives, learned the languages and auxiliary skills, etc. You MIGHT get to the level of publishing an article in a journal for undergraduates by the time you are a junior or senior in college. That would be a huge success. Once you're a PhD student, you can focus on submitting articles to reputable scholarly journals with strong impact-factors.   \nWriting and publishing a book is what gets a professor tenure! That is what you are aiming for about 5 years after your PhD, when you're heading into tenure review. This should never be dangled in front of a high school student as a normal thing to do. Once you get to college, you're going to have a lot of professors who won't manage to publish a book and are denied tenure because of it. (One of the best professors I had in college killed himself because of this.)  \nYou may be the next Wittgenstein, but even he did not publish until he was 32 or so. (If he had published something at sixteen, it probably would have been terrible and hurt his legacy.) Because of self-publishing, anyone can get anything published. Don't do it.   \nSlow down. This is like trying to land a 747 because it would look good on your application. It would be really cool, but you need to take flying lessons first.",

I assume when high school students are talking about being published, it's as part of a scientific article, where they did work in the research lab and are rewarded for it by getting their name on the article. With humanities and social sciences, I never assumed anything was actually being published outside of self-published stuff, which prestige-wise is the same as printing something and throwing it out the window. But, it makes sense that some places with less than scrupulous academic mores would do this. And that  elsewhere predatory journals spring up to take advantage of kids wanting to use this on their college app.\n\nThe drive to publish something isn't bad, and the drive to research is even better\u2014it's just that high school is not the right time to publish academic research. (There may be one case in 40 million that proves me wrong.)",

I can imagine a very rare circumstance in which a high schooler contracts with a traditional publisher to write a work of fiction, but I can't imagine any circumstance in which a high schooler contracts with a traditional publisher to write a book of historical essays. I don't mean any disrespect, but you need a ton of study, and access to resources that you probably don't have in high school, before you can write something new or interesting in a historical essay.\n\n(This is a little inside baseball, but even an actual professor would have a hard time getting a contract with an academic publisher, let alone a trade one, to write a book of historical essays. There's no market for it, even by the standards of academic publishing.)\n\nPublishing with a vanity press or a hybrid publisher (which is similar) would do the opposite of what you want for your resume. It would make you look like either you're a mark or you think the admissions officers are marks.\n\nIn short, if you're set on writing nonfiction, you've got a road ahead of you before you can publish a book. And that's okay. At your age, that's completely expected. You might try to write a column for your local paper or something, to get your feet wet.",

            "comment": "Re scientific papers:  One can think of publishing in high school as an exercise in drive and persistence (with luck and connections/resources mixed in there).  I've personally published over 100 peer reviewed articles in medical journals, and I've mentored numerous trainees at all levels in the process.  Most are good at 1) data collection (told what to do), some are good at 2) drawing well established conclusions (basic analysis), few are good at 3) coming up with new, interesting insights (high analysis), and even fewer can do all of the above while 4) providing perspective (a synthesis of what's out there and the current thought landscape in the context of the data/results).  \n\nTo publish a worthwhile paper, one needs to demonstrate point 4 -- and doing this requires direct experience and dialogue/discussion in the field.  The only high schoolers who can do this are the ones who have someone do it for them (senior author/PI).  However, by doing point 1 (and maybe 2), most high schoolers who can be persistent enough to find the opportunities, and be lucky or connected, can publish.  And persistence requires one of two other factors:  1) extreme early frontal lobe myelination (high schooler is basically an adult and is extremely forward thinking), or 2) forward thinking, driven parents and an obedient child.\n\nNow for the bigger issue: publishing and admission to college.  Publishing doesn't necessarily indicate someone is smarter.  But it does show good time management skills, persistence, above average intelligence, and (likely) good social skills (you had to convince the professor to keep you on and give you a spot on the paper).  All of these traits are attractive to elite institutions.  Even if it's connections or resources that are the primary drivers, wouldn't those also be attractive to elite institutions?\n\nMy suggestion is to take a long view:  realize that life is a marathon and winning the college race does not guarantee success or happiness.  I didn't publish a single paper until after med school.  If you have goals, take small steps towards them every day.  If you don't, go through life/school with the goal to enjoy what you are doing and you'll eventually find your path.  Plenty of well published high schoolers wake up every morning telling themselves: \"I just gotta get through this and I'm good.\"  If you find you are saying this all the time, perhaps it's time to re-evaluate priorities.",

If appropriate platforms exist\u2014go for it. For example, that Texas Tech program for high school students seems really cool. On the other hand, putting together a book out of your AP Euro essays and self-publishing it on CreateSpace is not a good move. Submitting it to Yale UP is probably also unwise.\n\nThat said, I taught high school for a long time and there was one kid who was the real deal: a Southeast Asian government flew him out to explain some software program or something he'd developed to predict flooding in their country. So there are ***rare*** cases where a kid could be doing stuff like this, but in those cases it's probably a case of someone coming to them and saying, \"Hey, this is worth publishing.\" It's a little like trying to figure out at sixteeen how to become a professional basketball player\u2014if you're good enough, someone has probably noticed.",

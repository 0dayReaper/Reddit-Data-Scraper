    "postText": "I am a transfer student who applied via the common application for the fall 2023 semester. I found out I was admitted into the Steinhardt school of culture, human development, and education but the letter states \u201cit is my honor and privilege to share with you that you have been admitted to the Global Public Health: Media, Culture, and Communication program at the Steinhardt school of Culture, Education, and Human development beginning your studies at NYU Paris.\u201d\n\nAt the bottom it states \u201cYour application was considered for any and all NYU programs and campuses for which you requested considerations and your admission is only valid for the upcoming semester. Transfer students cannot defer their admission or enrollment\u201d \n\nWhat does this mean? Am I attending NYU Paris for just this Fall 2023 semester and then I go back to my current university to complete my bachelors?????? or am I studying abroad in NYU Paris and having the rest of my semesters in NY and graduate with an NYU undergrad degree? I called the global programs, Steinhardt, and transfer office and they all don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so confused. If anyone is in this situation and has this exact letter can you tell me what you know?",

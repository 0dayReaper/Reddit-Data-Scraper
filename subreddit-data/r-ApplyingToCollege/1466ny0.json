    "postText": "basically ive been having a kind of bad time for the past few months because i got into some of my absolute dream schools (northeastern &amp; oberlin, namely) and cant attend either for financial reasons. i did everything i could to increase my scholarships; i emailed the financial aid offices and practically begged. it wasnt enough. i ended up committing to rhodes college, which id barely considered previously (and only applied because my dad liked it). rhodes is still way out of our price range for college (even with nearly 40k in merit scholarships), but basically the only thing we could actually afford was my safety, which i thought i liked initially but ended up really disliking. my parents are withdrawing money from my siblings' accounts to pay for rhodes, which i didnt know about, and im also completely on my own for law school, even though aid applications factor in parents' incomes and assets until like age 25. now, i do really like rhodes. really. im back from orientation and i think the campus is gorgeous, memphis is great, and the programs are what i want. but i keep comparing it to my dream schools and thinking about how much different it would be if i were attending oberlin. i feel terrible because i know my parents want me to adore the school since theyre paying so much for it. so im a) disappointed im not at a school i like more, and b) feeling like shit about the financial stuff. i think i should have just gone to my safety and sucked it up for 4 years, no matter how bad a school. whatever. theres no solution to this, so i guess it isnt worth thinking about. im just ... feeling really terrible and needed to rant about it and maybe possibly hear some good stuff in the comments? idk. hope yall are doing well",

Time to let go of this concept of a \"dream\" school. Do you really think that Oberlin or Northeastern would be so monumentally life changingly different from Rhodes? Would the dining hall food taste like ambrosia? Profs so much smarter? Free puppies every Thursday?Etc. Rhodes and Oberlin are pretty close in USNWR LAC ratings. Having a \"dream\" school is like having a \"soulmate\". It's an utter bullshit concept.\n3. Which college to go to is often one of the first big life-changing decisions a person makes. When making big decisions like this, sometimes the middle road is the right decision. And sometimes going to one of the extremes is the right decision. You chose the middle road, and you can't go back on that now. You say you like Rhodes, so enjoy it and quit torturing yourself.",

BTW, financial aid changes every year based on a new fafsa, so you never know what next year will be.  An additional scholarship might arise due to gpa or other circumstances.  Beat the bushes for private ones this entire year.",

    "postText": "I kinda screwed up and didn't realize that some schools required that LORs had to be from in-school teachers. \n\nI have two choices at this point:\n\n(1) Average student in math class with the same teacher for 3 years. I could try to leave a SUPER good impression in the last months of senior year. For context, I was the average student, with good grades but never participated that much.\n\n(2) New senior teacher, but I could participate a LOT in his class because I know the topic in and out. \n\nWhat should I do at this point?",

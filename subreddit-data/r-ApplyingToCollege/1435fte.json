    "postText": "Major: Music Industry, Economics\n\n\nLocation: I live in Iowa, want to study in the Northeast or Southern California. I prefer urban campuses. I really liked Drexel when I toured it, but I also loved Princeton.\n\n\nDemographics: White female, middle class (90k a year), rural student.\n\n\nACT: 31 composite, 32 superscore \n\n\nGPA: 3.86 unweighted, doesn't weight \n\n\nSmall uncompetitive public school. No ranking, only one AP class offered to seniors. \n\n\nECs: \n\n\nJazz Band for 3 years (Soloist) \n\n\nJazz Choir for 3 years (Soloist) \n\n\nConcert Band for 4 years (First chair) \n\n\nConcert Choir for (4 years, section leader for 2) \n\n\nCommunity and School Theatre (4 years) \n\n\nNHS (2 years) \n\n\nVice President of Spanish Club at my school (2 years) \n\n\nLarge Group Speech (4 years), may do Individual Speech (1 year)\n\nFCCLA (1 year, the chapter will be brand new to my school)\n\nJob since 8th grade where I livestream sports events from my school\n\nI may start selling things I crochet, which might count as an EC?\n\n\n\nMultiple honor choirs \n\nCurrent college list: Bates, Bowdoin, Brown, Bryn Mawr, Daemen University, Monmouth University, Northeastern, NYU, Princeton, Smith, Swarthmore, Syracuse, Wellesley \n\nI have a common app fee waiver, so am just looking to maximize on that. I applied to Wingate and got in already, so I for sure have 1 acceptance. (They sent me a fee waiver and early application)\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Daemen offered me a scholarship already, so they are a safety, as well as Wingate. Monmouth may also be a safety. I'm looking for more targets, and maybe some more reaches.",

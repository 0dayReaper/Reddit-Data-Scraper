            "comment": "So don't actually do this, but you could read all the threads started by rising seniors who find they are not actually passionate about anything but getting into a prestigious college, and now have no clue what to do in their final summer that will fool admissions officers into thinking they actually care about something else.  Also all the threads about the essays and recommendations and such that may make a critical difference to their \"personal\"/\"fit\" prospects and that they similarly have no clue how to approach even at that late point in the process.\n\nTo be blunt, these people may have been spending a lot of time and energy thinking about various \"objective\"/\"hard\" qualifications, but have relatively neglected the more \"subjective\"/\"soft\" factors until near the end of the process.  And yet the colleges to which they are now seeking admission often use those \"soft\" factors to decide which of their far-too-many objectively-qualified applicants they will actually admit.\n\nSo how to avoid that fate?  Well, you have to work on becoming the sort of person these colleges say they want.  The type of person who is a natural and respected leader, has genuine values and passions, is friendly and supportive, and so on.  Basically the type of person other students want to be around, that teachers truly enjoy having in their classes,  that coaches love having on their teams, and so on.  Because they want that for their college too.\n\nFortunately, you have years to work on this.  And it generally takes years to do it really meaningfully.\n\nSo, what can you do to start that process?  Well, try out a variety of group activities, both during the summer and once school starts.  Identify the ones which you actually enjoy.  Ideally you will have some natural talent too (which of course is enjoyable), but you don't have to pick the ones that you are naturally best at.  Then really throw yourself into those activities.\n\nIndividual activities are OK too, if you are truly passionate about them, but the thing about group activities is they give you opportunities to develop your personal skills.  And in fact, even if your passion is at core an individual activity, at least try to find ways to put it in a group context too.  Like, maybe take on tutoring/teaching others in addition to practicing yourself.  That sort of thing.\n\nThen in group settings, try to be the person you would want to be around.  Try to develop as a leader, understanding this may involve some waiting for your turn.  Be understanding and supportive of your peers.  All this may seem somewhat awkward at first, but it is like anything else--the more you practice, the easier it will become.\n\nAnd do all this in classes too.  Understand the best classmates are active but don't try to dominate either.  Listen carefully to others and build on what they say, rather than just zoning out while waiting for your turn to show what you know.  Be generous with your time and energy in group projects, even if you feel like that means you do more than your fair share.  If you do that in good spirits, hopefully your teacher will notice even if that is not formally recognized in a grade.  And so on.\n\nIf you really commit to doing all this deliberately over the next few years, by the time you are a rising senior, you will hopefully not need any help from Reddit to figure out what to do.  You will have genuine passions.  You will have obvious opportunities to further those passions.  You will be a good person, and a good leader.  Your peers and teachers and coaches and such will already recognize you as a good person, and will be asking you to take on top leadership positions.\n\nAnd as a bonus--all this is not just good for college admissions.  It is good for life purposes as well.  So that's nice.",

I did read a few rising senior threads and they seem to be good at literally everything! \n\nFor example I saw this one Indian guy with a rly high gpa and SAT who liked physics and got a internship at nasa. Like how????",

                            "comment": "So in terms of tutoring, it depends on the activity, but usually if you are something like a HS sophomore or junior and notably good at something, there will be opportunities to tutor younger kids.  Some might be formal opportunities in your school, some might be informal opportunities you can arrange through friends and their families, some might be formal opportunities out of school that a teacher or coach can help you identify, and so on.\n\nAnd you can always do something that colleges tend to love, which is make your own opportunities!\n\nLike, suppose you got really into competitive swing dance.  You may find yourself in a youth program which then gives you opportunities to help teach younger kids.  Great.\n\nBut if that formal opportunity doesn't exist, maybe you just tell parents you would be willing to provide lessons.  Maybe you put up a bunch of fliers and do appropriate social media outreach about offering private swing dance lessons.  Maybe you reach out to local arts/music/drama teachers at K-8 schools.  Or local elder care facilities!  And so on.\n\nAnd it doesn't need to take off and become a multi-million-dollar international swing empire.  If you just get a few people to go for it, it can be a great story to tell about how you found a rewarding way to share your love of swing.\n\nThis ties into showing passion, which is that truly passionate kids find ways to spend their time doing the things they are passionate about.  Again, in some cases it is well-structured in that there are various in-school and out-of-school clubs and such.  But in other, arguably even better, cases, passionate kids create their own opportunities to find and interact meaningfully with others who share their passion.  And this will all work best if you truly love it, and are not just trying to fake it for college applications.\n\nThe important thing is to not let inertia, self-doubt, awkwardness, and so on hold you back.  If you love it, find a way to do it, which will in turn show both your passion and your character.  And again be more important to your development than just getting into college.\n\nFinally, I would strongly advise you to simply not care about what others are doing.  First, you can only take one slot at one college.  There is plenty of room for others.  Second, there are many things that sure sound impressive at first glance, but admissions officers are much more \"meh\" about than you might think.  And the reason they are more \"meh\" about it is they know people do these things to impress them, and that is ironically not so impressive.  And frankly, often times there is a well-connected parent operating the background, which is also not so impressive.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean a kid who freakin' loves NASA and then gets an internship at freakin' NASA won't be able to sell that story too.  Maybe they will be your roommate at college!\n\nBut if you listen to actual admissions officers, over and over they will tell you they would like nothing more than to admit both the kid who freakin' loves NASA, and ALSO the kid who loved swing dance so much they spent a bunch of their time swing dancing with little kids or the elderly for free (I am tearing up just thinking about it, and I entirely made it up!).\n\nAnd you have to be otherwise qualified too, but the point is both of these people can get there if they are truly following their passions.  If you have to fake it instead . . . they may notice you are faking.",

There are some directly knowledgeable people here doing their best, but they seem a bit overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people looking for meaningful advice and information.  So I am basically just trying to help spread the sort of advice they give out to a bit wider audience.\n\nAnd you don't have to worry about this yet, but if in the long run this all works out for you, it would be nice if you also found a way to pay it forward, even in just a small way.  But again, for now just enjoy the journey.",

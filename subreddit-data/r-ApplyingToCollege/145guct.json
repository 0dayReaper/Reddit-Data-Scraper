    "postText": "Hi\n\nAsian male STEM about to start high school. Both high schools in my area are stem focussed and known to have great results. If I chose the most sought after school where all super achiever kids goto with parents in academia then I expect to be in 80th percentile of my class. I prefer this school and will have some of my good friends joining that school. School also matches my vibe and is closer. I also feel that I will learn more from my teachers and peers. The other school  is also rated very highly and is stem focussed. As fewer high achievers chose this other school and faculty in stem while great is not as strong as my favorite school. I will definitely be in top 95th-99th percentile. I am confused about which school I should chose as I am unsure if my relative positioning in my class / school will have much significance in my college admission cycle? My SAT score will be similar in both schools.\n\nThank you for reading and please share your thoughts .",

I never had to make a choice between schools like OP, but in middle school I excelled beyond my peers and was always top of my class. Then I suffered from depression in high school and faltered significantly. This can happen to literally anyone.\n\nI would say this would be an even greater factor of consideration for someone making OPs choice. If you\u2019re in a super competitive environment, that can be extremely damaging to your self-confidence, especially if you deal with any significant failure. Their decision should be based on comfort and fit in the school environment, not on their potential performance.",

It really hurt my self esteem and I think I am yet to recover from that.\nI went to a top Canadian school eventually, and I found college and work to be much less challenging than high school, like your kids. \nHaving said that, if I were given the opportunity, I would pick an easier school in a heartbeat. It\u2019s not only that you get into objectively worse schools, but the level of struggle is definitely not worth even getting into top ivies.

Like the high achievers at the schools are going to succeed and do well regardless. So it\u2019s not the school that\u2019s making them good, probably their friends or parents or themselves. In the same vein though, surrounding yourself with high achieving people is the most important part of being successful. You can do so at both schools, but it sounds like it might be easier for you to make friends that are also high achieving in the other school. So I\u2019d recommend you go to the \u201chard\u201d one.",

It\u2019s a very common theme for highschool tryhards. I watched my valedictorian get pregnant and drop out after turning to a party girl lol. best of all is seeing the girl who was in honors classes drop out and go back to cc her sophomore year of college \n\nbesides CS is a field that (I\u2019m basing this off of introverted madness\u2019s video on it) is based around doing 1,000 technicals and rounds upon rounds of interviews, and Asians with a lack of social skills and character development are a DIME A DOZEN in that field. \n\n\nbe different, but most of all be yourself and do what you want to do\n\n\n(ps if ur a premed reading this ignore what I said)",

Sure maybe you won't stand out, but that doesn't mean your chance of getting into a good college decreases because everyone around you is smart + a good HS mean you will learn more and acquire more skills and resources",

Although I\u2019m not sure exactly how much they would consider that info, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to try. Also, I agree with everybody else about the fact that u can ED to NYU. Ur extracurriculars are amazing as well as ur SAT, so u definitely have a shot. Good luck!",

Your SAT is great, and while you likely don\u2019t have much of a chance at ultra meritocratic schools like MIT, I\u2019d say T30 schools like Harvard, Penn, Northwestern, WashU, UChicago, Brown, and Dartmouth, which aren\u2019t as focused solely on stats but rather more the entire individual and his/her circumstances could still be in play with killer essays and ECs. I had a friend get into Penn with a 3.49 and a 1510 (white male non legacy no typical hooks) so anything is possible. I would say NYU ED would give you your best shot at NYU. I believe the school got 120,000 apps this year so ED will surely help you standout. I think you need to very thoroughly explain your situation and spend a lot of time on your essays if you want any shot at really any T30s.",

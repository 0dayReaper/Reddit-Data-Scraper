Was it easy to get accepted to CS as a pre science major?\n\nEdit: I think i made a mistake here. I want to ask how hard is it to get admitted to CS as a pre science major at UW?",

More than any other school.\n\n&gt;If you\u2019re not admitted directly as a freshman, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be admitted to either computer science or computer engineering as a UW student.",

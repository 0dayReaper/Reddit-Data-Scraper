Stop once he goes down the well, the rest of the book isn\u2019t good.\n\nI see a lot of personal essay writers overthink things; students think they have to show ABCDEFXYZ in their essays. But we all consume content; we all know what a good story looks like. Ultimately, you\u2019re just trying to write a good essay that shows who you are. \n\nThe first part of \u201cFairy Tale\u201d is about NOTHING. It\u2019s just a boy who meets and becomes friends with an old man. And yet it\u2019s riveting. I read a lot, and this book made me sit up and think, damn, this guy can write. \n\nIt also happens to show that the protagonist is a good kid \u2014 loves dogs, has a good heart, is willing to do what\u2019s right. \n\nYes, it\u2019s unfair to compare a book to a 650 word essay. But as I see students struggle to find something \u201cinteresting\u201d enough to write about, that also demonstrates their \u201chook\u201d and explains their life story \u2014 down that path is bad writing. Good writing can be a lot simpler than that.",

    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a sophomore going into junior year and I really slacked off. I still ended up with A-\u2018s and B\u2019s this sophomore year but I am trying to gun it for one of the UC schools. If I were to get amazing grades junior year, do extracurriculars that colleges like to see, and do really well on my essays, would I still have a chance getting into schools like UCLA for example?",

Will I get good scholarships? Hell, will colleges even accept me???\n\nAm I fucked for college applications? Or will I be fine. I also have two very strong personal essays. Sorry if this is the wrong tag for this:)",

Recruits from non-target schools literally make up single digit percentages of the people hired in a year. Telling someone you can go to a top firm from a no name school is simply misguided and is similar in vein to telling someone they can go be a Hollywood actor/actress too.\n\nNot to mention the fact that big4 is not that difficult to get, the argument stands for top strategy consulting firms/divisions and BB/EB banks. Anyone from a semi-decent school with a 3.5+ GPA and applicable major can be a big4 consultant. If all you know is big4, you likely don\u2019t know how recruitment works. Your argument is simply wrong and you don\u2019t seem to know much about recruiting in this industry, so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to make blanket statements about it.\n\nThe clients care. It\u2019s easier to sell to the client that your team can solve their billion dollar problems or facilitate their billion dollar IPOs when you can say everyone on your team went to an Ivy+ school. It\u2019s that simple, it\u2019s just business.\n\nThere is no need to get defensive because you\u2019re being challenged. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s so hard to understand other industries work differently.",

Depending on the school rank, you might legitimately have better odds of getting struck by lightening.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much what I said. I specifically pointed out top strategy consulting firms and BB/EB banks. If you\u2019re at a non-target, you\u2019re pretty much screwed for MBB and T2 consulting firms, along with BB, EB, UMM, MM, and probably even LMM Ibanks. If you\u2019re going to a non-target, your only practical option, if it even happens, is probably going to be a local boutique bank or non-strategy consulting firm with alumni employees. The exit opps, the compensation, the network, and the perks that come with that are a lot different from being at a top firm and this is not the outcome people are talking about when they say they want to be a banker or consultant. They mean they want to be at McKinsey or Goldman.\n\nEven then, boutique firms and banks are not so easy to break into. You are still competing against fierce competition from top schools who want to go to local banks. A non-target school is always going to make your life comparatively harder.",

Talk with your high school counselor and see what you can do first. \n\n2. There are scholarships for people who have a 2.5 or higher GPA, you just have to dig (Alabama State University has a scholarship, I believe). \n\n3. You can also try and improve your ACT/SAT score to near perfect, as colleges could use that instead to allow you to apply. \n\n4. You can bring your weighted GPA up through taking honors classes (which typically have more weight in weighted GPA than generals classes), just pick your favorite subject. These classes tend to be faster-paced and more in-depth than regular classes, so that\u2019s why you should definitely pick a subject you enjoy so it\u2019s not as monotonous. \n\n5. A comment below also said this, but you can apply to a community college for your associates and also get some of the other core subjects out of the way, and then transfer to a school afterwards for bachelor\u2019s and whatnot. If you make good grades in community college, it will help with transferring, just make sure that the credits can transfer. There are also scholarships for transfer students.",

When your researching a school google \u201c[insert school name here] net price calculator\u201d and it should give you a decent estimate of the cost for you to attend that school",

I screwed up my freshman year, which was online as well- I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s a good thing, but I am happy to know I\u2019m not the only 2020 freshman who struggled especially being on the sub Reddit. I got Cs and Bs my freshman year after being an A student all throughout middle school (and even sophomore and junior yr)\n\nI just hope admissions officers will have mercy on us \ud83d\ude2d",

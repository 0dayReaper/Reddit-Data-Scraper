    "postText": "Hi! I'm a current junior gearing up for college apps, and trying to narrow down/improve my college list. \n\nFor context, I'm planning on applying for aerospace/mechanical engineering (depending on the school's major offerings). My UW GPA is most likely at a \\~3.7 after this year, weighted probably around a 4.4 - 4.5 (estimated guess). SAT is currently a 1490 (760 math, 730 reading) but just retook so hopefully will improve. EC's are pretty good. \n\nList: UMichigan, Purdue, UIUC, Texas A&amp;M, UMD, Georgia Tech, VA Tech, CU Boulder, WPI, RPI, Rose Hulman, Iowa State (very reach-y, I know)\n\nConsidering adding: Clarkson, UKentucky, Oregon State, Embry Riddle, Michigan State, Union College, Lafayette College, Bucknell, Lehigh University\n\nI'm really interested in both STEM + humanities, which is why I added union, lafayette, bucknell, lehigh to the maybe-apply list.\n\nI'd really appreciate any insight anyone can provide! Feel free to critique list/add suggestions (I need advice on safeties most I think...)\n\nThanks in advance!!",

I personally know students who aren\u2019t happy with the engineering major they ended up with at TX A&amp;M. Rose Holman is a very particular sort of school. Make sure you visit. \n\nMechE vs Aerospace\u2026.research this choice carefully.\n\nSince they aren\u2019t too far from you, go visit GWU and UDelaware. On the opposite side of the couch try, Oregon State has a solid engineering program and the MECOP internship is very popular there. You\u2019d possibly receive merit scholarships from these 3 schools. Run the NPCs and read about OOS merit scholarships.",

Is the first-year engineering at Purdue the same as TX A&amp;M in this regard?\n\nI've visited Rose Hulman, I liked the campus and size (which, although smaller than my HS, has several advantages IMO), but I'm hesitant about the fact that it is solely STEM, with fewer humanities options for fun exploratory classes, if that makes sense?",

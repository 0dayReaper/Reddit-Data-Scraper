Its really who is the best storyteller during those interviews ngl. I had to rely on tough assignments and experience at minimum wage jobs i wish i had something a little a little more relevant for a professional job.\n\nJust look up sample interview questions for the job and you will see what im talking about, most of the interview for this govt job at the treasury was about conflict resolution and times you worked as a team mostly and those are soft skill granted i passed the accounting test so maybe thats why there were no technical questions",

Join the biking club, the improv club, the board game club, intramurals, etc.  If you end up doing some organization/leadership for the group, that can be a decent resume point but it doesn't need to be.",

In close-knit clubs, the members planned game nights, tailgates, cookouts, parties, restaurant runs, movie nights, hikes, vineyard tours, and watch parties, among other things.  Moreover, they often arranged weekend, spring break, and post-final exam trips.  As for usefulness, many employers and grad schools like to see evidence of soft skills like creativity, confidence, leadership, sociability, and the ability to balance work and life.  Personally, I think the fun and social experience is the main reason to join clubs, but my T10 law school would have been unlikely to admit a student without any college ECs.",

You really should be finding research opportunities and hopefully get publications. And you should try to TA or grade for a class. Tutoring is also a good option. Some students private tutor and they get to set how much to charge someone per hour.\n\nBut joining clubs is good for meeting others and to do a hobby.",

Or maybe you find your time occupied by something else that feels a better fit for you - a job/research/etc...\n\nAnd check out each school's environment... I know of schools where joining anything seems competitive... and other environments that seem much more welcoming.",

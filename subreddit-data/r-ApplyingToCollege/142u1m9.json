I currently live in the Bay Area which is why total cost and living would be much more convenient for SJSU. I am also planning to work somewhere in California post graduation, which is a large reason why I should stay in Silicon Valley, but also a major reason for me to want to leave this area and explore. Although I hope for a better student experience, I would value work opportunities and education more.\n\nOverall I would lean towards SJSU, but at the same time the name, academics, and location are all hindering my decision making.",

The location is a personal choice - you can continue to stay in California and visit other places during vacations using all the money that you'll be saving. I think SJSU would be a better choice in this case.",

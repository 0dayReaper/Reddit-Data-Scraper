    "postText": "I already know I'm going to apply to Princeton, Columbia, and Yale, even if it's unrealistic, simply because I'll regret never knowing if I *could* have gotten into my dream school. That being said, I'm still waffling about what other colleges I want to submit an application to, especially since the fees are so high.\n\n**Desired Major:** Art, and currently interested in language for a minor\n\n**GPA:** 3.95, both weighted and unweighted. And no, I didn't take any AP courses, which is by far the weakest point of my application and freaking me out badly. I had specific reasons for this, but still.\n\n**Highest SAT:** 1580 ~~(haven't taken the ACT yet, or any subject tests)~~\n\n**Ext. Activities:** Won an international art competition (lengthy interview, work featured in magazine and NY exhibit), currently working as a concept artist for a highly recognizable company, won top prizes at state fair, founded a non-profit (fairly large number of participants / raised 20K+), Vice President of the National Honor Society, 100+ hours of volunteer work for the TNR feral cat program, and a member of Art/German clubs at school. There's some more stuff, but this is pretty much the gist.\n\nEdit: I'm also working on getting some pieces into the Guggenheim. Nothing's guaranteed at the moment, but that would probably look good if it did happen.\n\n**LOR and Essays:** So my essay is only a draft right now, but I'm confident I can make it memorable (partially because I kind of have to, if I want *any* chance of getting into a reach). I've always been really close with a lot of my teachers, too, so I'm not worried about the letters of recommendation. The letter from my counselor probably won't be as strong, but I certainly don't think she would write anything unflattering.\n\n**Optional Arts Supplement:** Will be submitting one, and I'm hoping it'll work in my favor, not against me.\n\n**Current In-State Options:** UNC of Chapel Hill, Davidson, and Lenior-Rhyne. Also, I have no problem with going out-of-state, but would preferably like to stay near the East Coast (especially somewhere North, since I just moved from the South in September and don't want to go back lol).\n\n\\- - - - - - -\n\nThank you in advance, and apologies for this being so long by the way.\n\n**10PM/Edit:** Alright, I just remembered something. If you can think of any colleges that teach Scottish Gaelic, that would be a decent selling point, since it's a really hard course to find in the US. I planned on going to the UK for years, and being able to learn this language in particular was something I was looking forward to. I know Harvard does, but that's not much of a safety school. \ud83d\ude05",

The portfolio and a baseline academic standard are generally key. \n\nSo RISD, Pratt, SCAD, Cooper Union, SAIC could all be good options. It all depends on what you want to focus on for art. \n\nBtw, SAT subject tests don\u2019t exist anymore.",

Colleges want to see you take the most rigorous coursework available to you, in many schools that means APs but there are many schools with different options for rigor.               \n- 1580 is an excellent SAT score, don't bother with the ACT.

Recognize there were some unique circumstances, but I would dig deep on the type of art you want to study and what schools excel at that.

Close proximity to NYC, being surrounded by peers that will motivate me, intellectual challenges, decent career assistance, etc. are all things the Ivies I listed can offer, even if they don't specialize in my major specifically. Furthermore, the prospect of financial aid (huge box checked with Princeton) is really good from what I can calculate. \n\nAlso, I've deliberated over it before (+ had lengthy discussions about it with my mom), and academics truly are of equal importance to me, especially since I'm not satisfied with how HS turned out.\n\nThat being said, you make some very good points.

Just make sure to explain your situation thoroughly in your application and ask your Guidance Counselor (and any teachers you ask for letters of recommendation) to do the same. I think you have a very strong shot at some amazing schools if you really work hard on your application!!\n\nAlso, if you're female and open to Historically Womens Colleges, I think you would be a great fit for Mount Holyoke College or Bryn Mawr College. Mount Holyoke specifically has a strong Art Department and offers a ton of languages. Bryn Mawr is very strong for languages as well, particularly Russian. \n\nGood luck to you, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like help with anything!",

Certain classes are rigor classes- chemistry, biology, and certain maths etc even at regular high school level. If you school didn\u2019t have AP or much besides regular classes than they won\u2019t judge as much as you\u2019d think. Especially with that damn near perfect SAT you have. Your ECs are genuinely cool and go along with your passion, which is something I feel you don\u2019t see much.\n\n\nI\u2019m not in college but Davidson is #2 on my list. Idk if I will get in. It\u2019s a target but a difficult target.",

If you do, stop looking where white-collar, lawyer-class professionals think is impressive-- your Yales, Princetons, blah blah blah-- and go to where artists are. A few: Rhode Island School of Design, Parsons, Goldsmiths, Art Institute of Chicago, Central Saint Martins, etc. \n\nI suggest you look up the 100 \"best\" (your mileage may vary) living contemporary artists and where they went to school. This will teach you, in short order, if this is actually the life you want. You want to be near NYC-- that's great!--you could go to Pratt or FIT. \n\nPrinceton doesn't make painters; it makes presidents. \n\nOn your sidebar question-- Edinburgh teaches Gaelic. [https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/short-courses/subjects/languages-courses/gaelic-courses](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/short-courses/subjects/languages-courses/gaelic-courses). Fair warning: Scotland is not the weirdly whimsical place Americans think it is. It's a real, gruff place with very particular politics and precious little time for bullshit. I love it-- I've just finished a Master of Science with Edinburgh-- but you'll be stepping over drunks from 2pm in the afternoon and nobody eats fresh fruit or vegetables. As a general rule, I do not recommend Scotland to Americans; generally, if you're coming from the USA, London is a softer landing.",

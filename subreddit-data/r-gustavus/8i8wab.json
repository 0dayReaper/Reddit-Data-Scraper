The question came up as to what are good things to have in a Gustavus dorm people might not think about. And it has been decades since I was in college elsewhere.\n\nSo what helps to have around? What things did parents insist you take that you didn't need?",

            "comment": "I never stayed in the two-three person rooms on campus, but from my experience the following are the things I would say to take/leave:\n\n**Take:**\n\n-Decorations that are personalized, like photos in frames \n\nIt's always a pain in the ass to take down decorations, so things that remind them of home but are simple are best\n\n-Sports/activity equipment \n\nIf you plan on joining club sports, like to exercise and socialize outside. \n\n-Storage bins \n\nThe beds on campus have adjustable heights, meaning you can store big bins, small bins, and everything in between under the bed. I found them especially helpful for shoes, extra school supplies, basic medical supplies and spare toiletries. They were also great for moving in and out. \n\n-Good, portable shower caddy and towels\n\n-Two sets of sheets XL Twin (one might turn into a toga)\n\n-Pillow topper for the mattress, maybe even two if you like it soft\n\n-Portable laundry basket\n\nIncluded in this is your own laundry detergent and softener. I got a backpack like laundry bag and I still use it now - in grad school! \n\n-Compliant hanging supplies for decorations\n\nThe 3M stuff you can buy pretty much anywhere, pro-tip get the reusable ones so all you have to do is buy extra sticky bits. \n\n-Extra blanket(s)\n\nI brought a heavy winter blanket to put between my sheets and comforter during the cooler months, and a smaller blanket that I could bring to events or wear around the room.  \n\n**Leave:**\n\n-Fairy lights or \"cool lighting\" \n\n-Kitchenware \n\nMost dorms on campus have a kitchen you can use, that includes a fridge, toaster, oven, etc.! I do recommend bringing a mug/cup that is microwave safe, maybe a bowl or plate, and 1 spoon and 1 fork for the days you want to eat at home.\n\n-Extra furniture (like Target chairs, IKEA sofa, etc)\n\nDorms come fully furnished and unless you have your own living room and plan on having lots of people over at a time, extra furniture is unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n**In between:**\n\n-Personal refrigerator \n\nThey make lots of noise at night, not necessary but can be helpful at the end of the month when the meal plan balance exceeds the amount you're gonna spend for the rest of the month - ie SNACKS!\n\n-A small nightstand\n\nThis only applies if you already have a nightstand and use it regularly, but obviously contradicts not bringing extra furniture\n\n-Drapes/rug\n\nI brought my own drapes and rug because I like color and some dorms are severely lacking. If you do bring your own drapes, know that fabric on walls is AGAINST the rules (apparently) and you will need to bring an adjustable shower rod in order to hang them up as there are no other mechanisms. If you bring a rug, also buy a floor protector for that rug in case the color easily transfers. \n\n-Plastic drawers\n\nI had a lot of clothing, so I purchased one of the plastic dressers from Target that has 3 drawers and put it inside my closet. \n\n**Tips:**\n\n-At the end of each year, people who live far away/are graduating/do not want their things will often leave stuff behind and post on relevant Facebook/Craigslist groups. This is a great way to pick up things at a reduced price, especially if you are moving from a shared dorm to a single room w/ a shared space. \n\n-If you don't use it now, you probably won't use it in college either. \n\n-It is better to bring less than more, and you'll regret it at the end of the year when you are packing up that lava lamp that you turn on like, twice. \n\n-There will be chances to pick up things you feel you need after you move in!

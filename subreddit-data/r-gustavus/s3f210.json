            "comment": "I graduated over ten years ago. In my 30s now. When I attended it was like 2500 students. I think it was an ATH for enrollment when I was a student. It\u2019s small enough to get to know a lot of people but you won\u2019t know everyone. \n\nGet involved in some student orgs and you\u2019ll easily make friends beyond just your class year. Some of my closest college friends didn\u2019t graduate my year. \n\nI saw your other posts at in some actual bible colleges. Gustavus is ELCA affiliated but it\u2019s not a bible college, despite what some of the more conservative Republican students tried to argue during my time on campus. Yeah there\u2019s a giant chapel with a cross on campus that you can see for miles from 169 but it\u2019s not a Christian bible college. \n\nIf you\u2019re from Minnesota and the live in the Twin Cities you\u2019ll notice Gustavus grads everywhere. My wife, who isn\u2019t a Gustie, basically assumes anywhere we go we\u2019ll see some one I knew directly or indirectly from college.\n\nThey have out a ton of money into the new academic buildings on campus. They were a little dated when I was a student but I\u2019ve toured them recently and they\u2019re really nice spaces. Reply here or shoot me a message if you have any other questions.\n\nEdit: I also see you\u2019re looking into engineering programs. Remember Gustavus is a liberal arts school, so they don\u2019t have any engineering programs. YMMV.",

Administration sucks, dorms are ass, and the party scene is non-existent. Since it's a residential college, don't expect to get off campus until senior year, and even then it's unlikely. GAC also has a different credit system compared to nearly ever other school, meaning transferring is near impossible. If I was an upcoming freshman and knew what I know now, I'd tell Gustavus to fuck off.",

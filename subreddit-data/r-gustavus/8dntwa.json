            "comment": "I would rank Pittman first. It's a smaller all-freshman building, with 4 floors. Rooms have big closets and sinks which is a plus, and I believe it (as well as sohre) is closer to classes. \nNorelius is also all freshmen, but it's a lot bigger and therefore may have less of a sense of \"building community.\" Floors are arranged in square \"sections\" with a common area. The closets are a bit smaller and the rooms are as well, but it's overall a nice place. Like Pittman, the floors are carpeted. \nSohre would be my last choice as it's not entirely freshmen. The building is almost identical to Pittman (minus the carpet) but hosts sohpomores and more as well as hockey boys.  ",

            "comment": "Hey there, I graduated in 2014, so things have changed since I've been there. The dorms all have their pros and cons, so it depends on what your son prioritizes. I lived in Norelius Hall and enjoyed it quite a bit; it was close to the cafeteria and seemed easier to socialize (really nice common areas, plus majority of freshmen lived here). Both Pittman and Sohre Hall are very similar, so there's not much differentiation between the two, but both are quite far from the cafeteria. The halls are smaller and therefore the community is usually more tight-knit for these halls, and I recall the facilities being much nicer at Pittman and Sohre than Norelius (since Norelius is a much older building).\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: I should add that not having sinks in Norelius seemed disadvantageous, especially if you're someone who likes to get ready in front of a mirror in your own privacy.

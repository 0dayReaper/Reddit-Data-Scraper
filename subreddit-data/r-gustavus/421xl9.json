    "postText": "I am applying for an open professorial position at Gustavus in the MCS department (as a mathematician).  I am interested in hearing what students have to say about the current department.  Any comments are appreciated, but my goal is to find out if there are specific things I feel I might be able to improve, or specific ways I would fit in with my teaching style and interests.",

When taking calc 2 a while ago, I felt like my prof had more than enough knowledge to teach us the subject, but did it in such a way where he skipped parts of lessons that we needed but he didn't find necessary. He also would give us many problems way beyond our pay grade for tests and homework. ",

                    "comment": "This is a common problem that permeates most math courses.  The professor feels like they did a good enough job teaching that the student can work through the gaps and thus gain a deep understanding of the material.  The problem is that this works well for math majors, but not usually for non-majors.  I feel this technique can be used well when you say to the class \"There is a step that I am skipping here, and that step is addressed in homework exercise blah blah, which is assigned.\"  Most calculus books in particular will have specific step-by-step problems that exist specifically for this purpose.\n\nAlso, tests suck.  I avoid them like the plague.\n\nThanks for the comment.",

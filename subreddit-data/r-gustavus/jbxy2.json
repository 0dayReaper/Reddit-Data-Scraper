    "postText": "The Gustavian Weekly is looking for photographers for this coming Fall. \n\nAs a Weekly photographer, you will receive assignments every week to cover stories and events. \nYou will write captions, learn editing techniques and vision, and learn how to integrate your work into a newsroom workflow. Weekly experience looks great on a resum\u00e9, and you can be a photographer for either work-study (how kickass is that?) or straight cash (homie). \nYou get to see events on campus, and get paid (or work study). \n\n\nInterested? PM and we'll talk. \n\nFeel free to tell your friends, leave questions, etc. etc. (PM if your friend wants my email.)\n\n\n",

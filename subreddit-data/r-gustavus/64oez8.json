As for a better registration time, for the first time you register (I believe the summer before your first semester) I don't remember how that's determined. But once you're a student, registration priority is determined by credits, so completing more credits will get you an earlier registration time. This'll mostly just give you an advantage over people in your same year, unless you come in with a lot of credits.",

            "comment": "Like said before, your registration priority is based on how many credits you have basically so upper class men have first dibs. When I started though I had a ton of AP and PSEO credits so I was registering with sophomores so I got basically any class I wanted as a first year. \n\nAs for what to pick, unless you know 100% what your major is just take classes that sound interesting. My first semester I took sociology, psychology, religion, and math. I ended up graduating with a chemistry degree so I'd encourage you to explore plus it takes care of class requirements. \n\nAs for professors, that's a pretty personal thing I suppose. There were teachers I absolutely adored that others heavily disliked. I'm a couple years removed but I'd say if you like Chemistry, Dr. Burr is a fantastic teacher. Or if psych is your thing, Dr. Hecht is awesome.",

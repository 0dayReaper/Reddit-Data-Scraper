They never picked me up, they overslept. I called but no answer. So I went to school on my own. I got to my final late af. I scrambled just enough to pass the class. Can\u2019t trust no one lol",

Tell me why it said 0 questions before I started it. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I clicked start \u2014 there was nothing, it was blank, and it wasn't until the shock passed that I realized I used my only attempt for this bs.\n\nHe didn't upload the questions to the final yall and he wasn't replying or answering our frantic emails. My classmates and I were freaking out in the group chat.\nWe had to reach out to the chair of the department, and it wasn't until nearly an hour later did he finally fix it. Oh but I still had to message him saying if he can open it back up because I used my only attempt already. He did fix it, I aced it, but jfc, never taking a class within that department again. Pure stress.",

Of course the system told me I needed a permission number, so I emailed the teacher regarding the situation. Never got a response, so I decided to email them again a week later. Keep in mind that it\u2019s best to join/drop a class before a month in and I knew this. By week 7/8 I never heard a response and knew I was fucked, so I decided to go to the department. They weren\u2019t much help and we\u2019re basically blaming me. They did email the teacher and by week 8 the teacher responds to me saying that it\u2019s too late to join the class. As if I wasn\u2019t trying to join over a month earlier. So now I have to take the class over the summer.",

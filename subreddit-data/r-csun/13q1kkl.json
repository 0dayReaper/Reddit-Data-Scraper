    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m an international student and I\u2019m accepted into CSUN for Fall 2023. My housing waitlist number was 1397 and I am worried that my chances of getting into housing is really low. \nI am unable to live off campus and my only option is to live on housing. I am unable to attend or live anywhere unless I\u2019m in housing, is there anyway to move up the waitlist? I am so worried right now.",

I recommend calling every month and seeing where your chances are, the waitlist should start going down by July.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone\n\nI was wondering if there was somewhere on the portal I can see exactly how much tuition would cost for me??\n\n\nI got the financial aid summary via email and it gave me the $7000 number they list on their website, but they called that an estimation I want to know for sure how much it would actually cost (if possible).\n\n\nI saw on the financial aid section of the portal that it said family contribution would be like $26k... which is obviously scary cause I don't have that kind of money and I'd prefer to not takw out huge private loans.\n\n\nAny help at all would be appreciated",

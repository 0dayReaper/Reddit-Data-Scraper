After 7 days a non-return fee of up to $250 will be assessed. If you have already returned your regalia, please disregard this notice.\n \nIf you have any additional questions on the return of your gown, please contact customer service at 1-800-837-4235.\u201d\n\nI called today and the rep mentioned there will be drop off locations around the graduation ceremony.",

I think one class is like 1,500",

I\u2019m also looking at CC, so would this process be the same or do I have to wait until the credits are transferred over to be able to register to any classes that requires passing calc 2. The end date for cc is 8/20 and the start date of csun fall is 8/26 I believe so it\u2019s a tight squeeze.",

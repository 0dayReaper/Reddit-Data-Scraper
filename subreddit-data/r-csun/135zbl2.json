            "comment": "I graduated w a degree in this last year. \nBiggest pro: I was able to get my broker\u2019s license right out of college. Normally you have to get your salesperson license first then work for 2 years before you can get your brokers, but California changed the law to where if you have a 4 year degree or equivalent in real estate you can bypass that 2 year work requirement. And like all the classes you take for the major go towards your license which was amazing \nBiggest con: since it\u2019s like one of the smallest majors in the Business school there\u2019s not much flexibility when choosing your upper division classes. There\u2019s usually only one\u2026MAYYYYYBE 2 sections so you can\u2019t really customize your schedule the way that you want and it especially sucks when ur a commuter and have to come 4 days a week cuz all the profs decided to have classes on different days. \n\nAs for the classes themselves they were all pretty good. I didn\u2019t LOOOOOVE the profs but I learned a lot so I can\u2019t complain.",

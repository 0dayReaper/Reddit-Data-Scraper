    "postText": "Hi guys, \n\nI was accepted into CSUN as a transfer student and I\u2019m heavily considering going here. I saw some groups on Facebook for some off-campus housing, however, I figured I\u2019d inquire and see if any of you have suggestions for where to find a place close to CSUN. Also, if you are looking for a roommate feel free to send a DM!",

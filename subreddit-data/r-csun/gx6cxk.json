    "postText": "I do this as I wish someone had done the same for me when I was in your shoes.\n\nShit is about to get real and not in a good way.\n\nI realize we all have different experiences so a few caveats about me:\n\nOriginally from Oregon - family was far away from me during school\n\nStudied Economics\n\nGPA 3.0\n\nLived in the dorms for two years and another two years in an apt with roommates walking distance\n\nGraduated not quite a super senior but close 4 1/2 years\n\nAlways attended full time except for my last semester\n\nWorked in Northridge part time\n\nNo student debt\n\n\nI think that about summarizes who I was as a student in general terms.\n\nDuring my last two years I became closer to classmates that were also in Econ and as time went on we realized we were all taking the same classes and started hanging out, studying / drinking together, there were 5 of us. \n\nAt that same time  rent was becoming more and more expensive I remember someone I knew who's parents bought a condo in 06 for $350k then rent out the rooms but they were definitely not breaking even. By the time I graduated that condo crashed down to $200k. \n\nDuring the last year I tried hard to find internships or jobs where I could use my degree and it just wasn't happening eventually found a job in retail ops that payed 30k a year it was better than nothing \n\nAs graduation was looming we all started panicking as none of us had landed a path forward by the end of it all, I had to move to Texas (a place I had never been, except for the Dallas Airport), another went to Minnesota, another one move to Seattle and the last two moved to the bay. Other acquaintances that stayed in LA had mix results but generally noone struck gold. This is where I'd like y'all to read about some of the issues you probably will encounter that go beyond money and the economy as a whole.\n\nDating became hard af. For starters you couldn't afford it or lived with your parents which isn't ideal. I stayed single until my mid-20s which in hindsight was awesome but as you get older it only gets harder and harder\n\nA lot of your friends or you will have to move back home to their/your parents. This takes a toll on anyone psychologically as it may feel like a failure. Don't let that get to you. Remain active physically and try to socialize as much as possible and remember you are not the only one.\n\nCSUN did not really have a large corporate recruiting experience and so we all found ourselves on our own looking for work. Noone really talked to us about the importance of networking. Try whatever you can to network with others. There may be opportunities there or there may not.\n\nWe all ended up with jobs that where way below our capacity. One of us worked at trader Joe's for 3 years after school. Nothing wrong with that but he didn't go to college to stock shelves. If this is you, know that it's OK! Better than nothing. \n\nI wish I had more advice for you, but the beervirus is a world noone alive truly understands. But assuming we find a vaccine I believe the economy will still take longer to recover. In that scenario let me offer you some ideas:\n\nGet out of LA, the city does not lend itself to a cool post college experience as salaries and cost of living don't really work for anyone let alone a recent grad. I have found people outside of LA to generally be friendlier \n\nDo not be afraid of leaving your family behind. It's not easy but it's also not great to be stuck at home just to keep your parents or siblings company. This is your chance to be on your own and experience the world. You can always fly back to see them. \n\nTravel, insert beervirus caveat, I was appalled at how little other matadors had traveled but if there's one thing I learned in geography class is that I needed to get out and see the world. You don't need a lot of money to do it either, but yes I am aware not everyone can do this. \n\nDo your best to stay in shape, the older you get the harder it gets and it's the best thing you can do in this situation. I wish I had done this. Running is virtually free\n\nAfter graduating I gained 20 pounds got depressed and got into some toxic relationships out of desperation. I was unemployed for a year and that's when I moved to Texas as it was the only place I got more than one call back from an application, Oregon was no better. My career didn't really take off until 2010 and as many other millenials it pushed off my life goals. \n\nMy friends and I stayed in touch to various degrees, we were great support for each other during those days even though we were far away. \n\nAfter it was all set and done by 2011 we all had \"our shit together\" in essence we got held back about 3 years and our salaries didn't really catch up until 2015 or so. Only one of my CSUN friends went to grad school (Ms Finance) during this time and it just dug her deeper into debt, she does well financially now but not by much compared to the rest of us considering the investment. \n\nI was fortunate enough to pay my way thru college as I worked my ass off and shared a room with a bunk bed to reduce my rent to the lowest amount possible. Aside from that from what I can gather virtually all my friends had paid their student loans 6 years after graduating. \n\nOnly a few of my friends have kids and I belive this is partially caused by the recession. A few more own homes and Noone is still in California. \n\nThat about does it for me. Yes there's lots of rambling and all of this is anecdotal and may not even be applicable to y'all as 2020 is a much different situation. Do your best and know that we can get through it.\n\nPS. The new CSUN logo is shit... Have any of you seen the N with the sword? That was my jam",

I treated finding a job as my current full time job at the time and would spend 6-7 hours a day looking through job postings, writing cover letters individualized for each job and submitting applications. While I spent some days applying to jobs in any state and really any engineering company, I kept coming back to usajobs.gov because I could send out more resumes for my time spent there, they make it ridiculously easy to apply compared to other organizations. I know the pay is lower compared to the private sector, but consider benefits, job stability, and I've been able to work from home and earn a paycheck through this crisis. Good luck Matadors!",

I'm going to talk about Portland as that's where most people go when moving here.\n\nRight this second if you really are motivated, you can get a job at Costco in a minute and pull $20 an hour. A one bedroom apartment will run you around $900~ a month  less if you go further out.\n\nYou will indoubtly be better off up here than in the Valley. Job opportunities used to be good but not great to be frank. Long term tho you will come out ahead. \n\nI wouldn't make any moves yet unless you don't mind working for a grocery store or warehouse (also pays over $20 h) but once things get better most definitely! Of course check LinkedIn and apply, It helps if you use a local address on your resume. Find a point on the map and use that on your resume if you have an 818 don't worry about that. \n\nThe one thing you will miss is the Sun and I don't mean sunlight I mean the Sun in the Winter, but dude you can always fly back to LA for $180~ round trip and get your vitamin D. \n\nBest of luck!",

Many of my friends and I have internships paying good money with companies who plan on hiring us out of college. It's a hard time, but if you can don't make it harder on yourself.\n\nEdit: If you think it will be too much work for you let me tell you it isn't. Engineering is filled with people who retake calculus 3 times, but their determination is what gets them through. If you can get any major you can get an engineering one.",

            "comment": "I do agree to move out of LA because everything is expensive and moving out of state is a good option but don\u2019t make it seem like living with parents is a bad thing. I say this because when people graduate high school they think they have to be independent but you don\u2019t even have to be an Econ major to know how bad it is especially if you grew up in poorer places like NoHo. My advise for people who are going to any university is if your parents let you stay with them, take advantage of that seeing how bad it is financially to live alone (which you\u2019re not because you\u2019ll most likely have roommates). Of course you can still work and be your own person just until you can get yourself off and running and eventually be your own person. \n\n\nListen to OP though about networking because I honestly have not had a job in relation to my major. I work at a restaurant instead of finding a job to gain experience for my major. I\u2019m still in CSUN graduating most likely Spring 2021 but this can pose difficulties in experience based on my major.\n\n\nI do understand why you felt like a failure moving back with your parents because you were doing your thing and it didn\u2019t go as well as you thought. \n\n\nJust the advise above is for those people who have parents that let them stay just don\u2019t be dumb and take too much advantage because you\u2019re still gonna have to work your ass off even with parents don\u2019t get used to everything being handed. Pay some household bills like utility. Buy a cheap car. Borrow your parents car. Pay partial insurance so long as you use it an equal amount. Take the bus if you can. Only reason I advise getting a vehicle is because it makes it easier to look around for part time jobs.\n\n\nI hope all gets better. I know with everything going on it gets even harder. This is a good post though to give people some insight. I also advise people to research their major with jobs available but network is the most important thing.",

The norm of where people end up will at best be a stable 60k job doing compliance type of work and the majority will end up settling for jobs for less. Unfortunately we do not have the luxury as OP said for campus recruiting exposure to top jobs at top companies (and top companies that do recruit on campus will usually recruit for a compliance/back office position).\n\nThe only way to get ahead of this is by networking and working on yourself both soft skills and hard skills wise as early as possible. Our competition at other schools like UCLA, USC, Berkeley, etc. are getting (within business) investment banking, private equity, consulting, strategy, high tech type internships even in their freshman year. These are the people that graduate into 100k+.",

There are a ton of roles and companies that do not have a weighting to the school you went to. The focus is not necessarily about the school you went to, but the network that you build while going to your school.\n\nFor example, a lot of startups (that will IPO) don't necessarily know about CSUN because if you look at the business school at CSUN, the culture and past history of students creating baller businesses is low.\n\nI would also say that high tech is a different story even though I mentioned it in my previous post. Generally tech jobs care more about skill and portfolio however the issue of getting past the HR screening that does look for keywords of \"better schools\".",

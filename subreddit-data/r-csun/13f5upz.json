Don\u2019t send them the full amount before seeing the ticket. \ud83d\ude2d am out actual money and I won\u2019t even be able to bring my little brother to my graduation ceremony\n\nI have the screenshots they\u2019ve been using to scam on multiple accounts. If you wanna double check DM and I\u2019ll send you what they\u2019ve been using.",

It was a group project and my name was on the document submitted by another group member.  \n\nI have to fight this because I worked my ass off in that class!\n\nHave ya\u2019ll ever had a grading error occur?  What are my chances of rectifying this situation?",

Had a buddy where some of my answers were the same as theirs but for some reason I was marked wrong.  Apparently they didn't realize it so I'm not sure if it was the professor or maybe had an aide or something",

Emailed the professor, we scheduled a call to talk about it, and he agreed to go ahead and change the grade back to an A. It\u2019s not hard for them to do, and it only takes a few days to show up.\n\nJust contact your professor, but send all your proof of submission (that it was turned in, on time, etc.) at once so there\u2019s no more delay.",

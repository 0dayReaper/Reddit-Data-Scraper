    "postText": "I\u2019m a transfer student coming from a community college, and I spoke with my advisor for the first time like two weeks ago. She\u2019s a bitch. She got annoyed with me when I was trying to ask a question, didn\u2019t explain ANYTHING, and hasn\u2019t answered any of my emails! It seemed as if she was like inconvenienced by meeting with me even tho that\u2019s her job. I literally don\u2019t know what to do because I don\u2019t trust the things she did tell me. \n\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences?",

Also since it's summer it may be hard to get in contact with her but for sure find someone on her who can help you if anything.",

So I figured I'd hop on here and see if we could get something better going!\n\nSo yeah, just introduce yourself below! Here's a quick profile if you wanna organise it a bit, it's what I'm using but no pressure my dudes.\n\nPronouns:  \nRequested Housing:  \nPlans to party?:  \nPlans to bring back people home?:  \nWeed/Nicotine?:  \nAlcohol?:  \nFirst year or Transfer:  \nMajor?:  \nAbout yourself:\n\nBut yeah! Just drop something about yourself below, and hopefully you'll catch someones eye enough for a message! Eager to see you all on campus!",

Did my two years in a community college to save some cash, before taking my acceptance to northridge because it was nearby. On the weekends, I like to go out, atleast for a little, to clear my mind of all the numbers and science terms college forces into my brain. A party, just some dinner with a friend, etc. Anything else...**  \n**Oh yeah! I can pop a sick wheelie on my old wheelchair (I'm out of it now). Do with that information what you will.**",

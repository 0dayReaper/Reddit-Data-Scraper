Can someone give me some guidance? Thanks in advance.",

To enroll in a course, you need a registration date and access to your student portal, which you don\u2019t have if you\u2019re not a student. I may be wrong tho, so try speaking to the office of the registrar. I\u2019m guessing that they would probably most helpful. (818) 677-3700 This is their number!",

I hope that's not the case because the program I'm looking at says that they prefer the prerequisites to be completed prior to applying to the program and it it part of the criteria for admission. Anyway I'll contact the number you provided, thanks again :)",

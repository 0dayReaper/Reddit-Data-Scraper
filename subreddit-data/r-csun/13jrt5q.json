    "postText": "All the ME classes say Staff, staff, staff and its an endless sea of STAFFS where the professor names should be. MSE too. Like what the heck? Why? \n\nOnly a few teachers have confirmed their classes, bless them. \n\nSo... what's going on? Is it laziness? Is it workloads? Is something happening? \n\nAre they conspiring to hide the names so that sections will be filled despite the fact people want to avoid the bad professors and take the ones who know how to teach???\n\nGod. Some professors get on students' cases about being lazy and then they go and do this. Pot calling the kettle much?",

In the ECE department it was same situation, a lot of students would sign up for the courses with STAFF but once it got revealed who the instructor is many would try drop or crash the preferred instructor's course.\n\nSome cases it's just they haven't found an instructor to teach the course.",

For example with the journalism department, I need two classes and the professors haven\u2019t been confirmed yet. \n\nI don\u2019t think it has anything to do with laziness or workloads but rather as someone on here said they\u2019re not informed of the sections that they\u2019ll be teaching until at least a few weeks before fall starts and a minority of those professors may even be teaching for the summer term.",

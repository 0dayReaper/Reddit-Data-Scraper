It\u2019s entertaining when he gets into arguments with his students tho since he has no filter. It\u2019s not as bad as I am probably making it sound because I did take him again after the first time since it was pretty easy as long as you know how to write a good paper. Didn\u2019t like Motameni and would definitely choose Mitchell over Motameni 10/10.",

Those make a big difference on who stays employed and who doesn\u2019t. And they won\u2019t trace it back to you cos it truly is completely anonymous.",

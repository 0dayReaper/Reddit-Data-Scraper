I would imagine as long as you\u2019re taking the required credits you qualify? The school does what it can to get you approved because it wants its money so you\u2019re probably fine. Good luck man.",

If you do 6 units + you will get financial aid automatically as long as u already applied for financial aid in spring. I just started my first week and I already got my money yesterday. I hope that helps.",

My last year's appointment was in April/May.\n\n We're in the same boat and have been screwed for our appointments \ud83d\ude2d not to mention some classes are only one section,,,\n\n Freshman got their appointments in early-mid April,  sophomore/eop/honors I believe got late April and May [can be wrong, I'm only guessing based on my peers' experience], while most juniors and some seniors have gotten mid-to-late June. \n\nAt this point, I think I'll only be able to take electives\ud83d\udc80",

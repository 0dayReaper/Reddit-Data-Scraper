It\u2019s not so bad.  College isn\u2019t like high school where there are cliques and everyone knows each other.  I graduated yesterday and I could count on 1 hand how many people I knew lol.",

I attended a private ceremony last week where members of a program I\u2019m in had walked a small stage after being spot lit and it was super bittersweet as I was glad for my peers but had that longing in the back of my mind. Try keeping that comparison to a minimum lol",

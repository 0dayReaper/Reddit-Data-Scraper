So everyone just please be careful for the sake of others but also for your own sake.)\n\nYes according to the news the elderly and those with an \"underlying condition\" are more at risk from the coronavirus (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-most-at-risk-from-the-coronavirus-11584048476](https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-most-at-risk-from-the-coronavirus-11584048476)).\n\nIt's also quite possible that there may be a minority of CSUN students with certain health conditions that result in a compromised immune system or that make it more likely for them to acquire serious health effects from the coronavirus if they get it (CSUN is a big university in terms of population of students meaning that students may have diverse backgrounds, and even people with serious health conditions sometimes still decide to attend university).\n\nSo, according to what I have heard from other people (e.g. some professors), for the sake of everyone it may be good to take precautions such as washing hands frequently, refraining from skin-to-skin contact, and refraining from going to places with lots of people. According to the Cleveland Clinic, social distancing is also recommended (their article states \"Social distancing involves avoiding large gatherings. If you have to be around people, keep 6 feet (2 meters) between you when possible\") (source: [https://health.clevelandclinic.org/covid-19-understanding-quarantine-isolation-and-social-distancing-in-a-pandemic/](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/covid-19-understanding-quarantine-isolation-and-social-distancing-in-a-pandemic/)).\n\nEdit: from the few sources I\u2019ve recently watched/read seems like even young people with no preexisting physical health conditions are getting it (one of the sources: NYT video - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bE68xVXf8Kw). So everyone just please be careful for the sake of others but also for your own sake. And of course (if you read your CSUN email) now there are 3 confirmed cases of COVID-19 of a CSUN employee and 2 CSUN students (https://www.google.com/amp/s/ktla.com/news/csun-confirms-3-covid-19-cases-2-students-1-employee/amp/, this news article also states part of the information in the email: \u201cIn a letter from CSUN\u2019s COVID-19 Response Team, officials said the cases are of an employee and two students. The employee had been on campus within the past week, but the two students had not been on campus recently and live in a neighboring county, officials said.\u201d)",

If we come into contact with it we might also pass it on to someone else, possibly someone who due to old age (which could include some CSUN faculty and staff, I don't know how old are the oldest staff) or due to a physical health condition (which could very well include some CSUN students) are more at risk from it.\n\nHere is an article I found by the way in case anyone could benefit from it, about steps to take if you are at higher risk of complications from COVID-19: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html).\n\nI don't know much about COVID-19 and I'm not saying that I believe that only the elderly and people with certain physical health conditions could get serious health complications or die from COVID-19, but the information presented does say that those populations are at higher risk, and I feel like in addition to being cautious for ourselves (whether or not one is elderly or has a physical health condition putting oneself at higher risk from COVID-19, but I also think it's probably good to be extra cautious if you are at higher risk) we also need to consider the fact that some people may be severely impacted if they catch it, and take precautions due to that. I mean I think that just because it may be true that some people may not get seriously sick or die from COVID-19 doesn't mean everyone won't, and to me that's partly why even currently healthy people with no underlying physical health conditions need to take precautions such as avoiding large gatherings, refraining from skin-to-skin contact, and washing hands frequently.

            "comment": "Hi. There are some misleading elements in this post. The most concerning facts about the coronavirus are this:\n\nThe coronavirus puts 20% of its patients in the hospital. All of those need oxygen. 5% of all cases need a mechanical ventilator to survive. Only 0.05% of influenza patients require hospitalization.\n\nThe death rate for coronavirus is estimated to be between 1% (Gates Foundation) and 3.7% (WHO), in comparison to influenza's 0.1% death rate.\n\nBy adding up the total annual fatalities for the flu, then for coronavirus, and describing them as 'mortality rate' you deeply mischaracterize and undersell the lethality of the disease.\n\nDuring the spike of the outbreak, this disease has the capacity to overwhelm our ICUs and medical facilities, meaning you won't be able to receive treatment unless you are near death's door.\n\nYou cannot say 'California has 114 cases' when our capacity to test is below that of almost any other place in the developed world. The fact that we have been able to discover 114 cases, some of them already near death, is impressive considering how few tests have been administered. There are doubtlessly many more spreading within local communities.\n\nThat said -- I'm not trying to fight you and I appreciate this post. I have no reason to make people unduly alarmed about this virus. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I'm not the news. But a narrative of 'just the flu' is dangerous to our elderly loved ones, and the immunocompromised people on our campus.",

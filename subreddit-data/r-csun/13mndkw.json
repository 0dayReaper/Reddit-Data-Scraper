    "postText": "My professor sent me a message on Canvas saying that he failed me and gave me a 0 because the Paper Report I wrote was \u201cAI Generated\u201d. And now, I don\u2019t really know what to do because TurnItIn says that it\u2019s 100% AI Generated when it\u2019s not. Because I aCTUALLY WROTE THE PAPER!!! I\u2019m wondering if there are other students on here experiencing/have experienced the same thing? I\u2019ve also been researching (on google and here on reddit) and found that this has been happening a lot lately, especially this semester. This is fckin insane!\n\nUPDATE 1: Thank you for all of your responses and for helping me. I\u2019ve emailed the professor and told him that I maintain my innocence and did not use AI to write my paper. Unfortunately, I\u2019m one of those students who delete their papers/reports after I have submitted it. Idiot move, I know. But I\u2019ve always done this with no problem whatsoever until now. This is also the first time I was falsely accused of using AI to write a paper in all my five years of college life. Hence, I have no proof to show anymore. However, the class will be offered again in the summer so I\u2019m planning on retaking it.\n\nBtw, I\u2019m not going to delete and take down this post in hopes that the higher ups at CSUN will take notice. Additionally, this post might also help and prevent other students from being falsely accused of using AI in their papers. So to my fellow students out there, DO NOT DELETE YOUR REPORTS UNTIL AFTER THE SEMESTER ENDS.\n\nUPDATE 2: Instructor still has not replied to my messages. I emailed him through gmail and messaged him on Canvas as well. Still NO replies. Welp, I guess \u201cProfessor\u201d Andrew Surmani is officially the most incompetent instructor at CSUN. This guy is dead set on failing his students because he is too lazy to read and grade the paper reports himself. Do yourselves a favor and avoid taking this lame instructor.",

If that does not work, show some abstract work of your paper to help prove that you did it. If all else fails I\u2019d go directly to the Dean and speak with them. These AI detectors are pretty much like snake oil and are professors are gobbling it up like no tomorrow. I don\u2019t blame them, this is a new technology that they don\u2019t understand, but hopefully, over the summer they can come up with a solution.",

Next thing we know, the people who trust AI to detect AI generated content with \u201c100% accuracy\u201d will also eat up the idea of AI writing legislation about AI. On the one hand, people say not to trust AI because the \u201cfacts\u201d can be wrong, but on the other, they want to trust it with things like this?\n\nI\u2019m really curious about the data Turnitin has on testing the accuracy of this so-called \u201cAI detector\u201d or whatever they call it. If I wasn\u2019t so lazy, I\u2019d look up the stats. But if they say it\u2019s 100% accurate, they\u2019re lying outta their asses, mark my words.",

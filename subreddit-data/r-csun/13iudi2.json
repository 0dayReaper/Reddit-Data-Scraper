During the semester, i was naturally excited for the workload to be over despite the fact that i love everything about school. But now that the day has come, i\u2019m a bit sad that this year went by so fast and I only have one year left before i\u2019m facing the real world alone. I\u2019m definitely grateful and I acknowledge how far I am to the end but just a little apprehensive to see what the future holds. \n\nAnybody else feel this way lol? I\u2019d like to hear your guys\u2019 perspective/comments",

I was able to study more and focus on school more. I wish I had more days like the semester that had passed, BUT I\u2019m sooooo ready to move on to the next chapter.",

That's why I'm looking forward to one last semester and make the best out of it, it'll be just one class so I'll have more time and probably take advantage of the src, intramurals, and maybe other stuff the school has to offer and hopefully make new friends.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am transferring to CSUN this fall! I looked at the schedule and I am a little confused about the online classes. \n\nAt my community college we had classes that were online but NO SCHEDULED MEETINGS. Like every week the professor would update the Canvas page with the weekly assignments and that was that. If they wanted us to watch their lecture, they would record it and post it.\n\nAre there any classes like that at CSUN?\n\nRight now I see classes labeled as either OH or OF, and both options list a scheduled meeting.\n\nI hope my question makes sense!\nThanks! :)",

            "comment": "welcome in ! for starters, \n\nOH = online hybrid, where it\u2019s up to the professor\u2019s discretion on whether they do half online, half in-person, or all in-person classes with the option to join in on zoom. \n\nOF = fully online, which could mean either asynchronous (no meetings, just weekly assignments like you had in CC) or synchronous (scheduled weekly zoom meetings, online assignments), which is probably why there\u2019s scheduled meetings on set days ! hopefully this helps :]",

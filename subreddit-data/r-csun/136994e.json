I feel kinda weird talking to someone with not a lot of experience and wanted to know if most of the counselors are students or not.\n\nI also wanted to know peoples experience with the UCS and if it was a positive experience or not.",

I would call and ask the UCS for more info, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll be matched with a psychologist with years of experience if you wish. Either way, I would definitely recommend  taking advantage of the free counseling sessions. They\u2019ve been very helpful to me and I wish I had gone sooner since I\u2019m graduating this semester. If you have any questions I\u2019d be more than happy to help:)",

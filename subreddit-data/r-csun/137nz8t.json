They say it's several hours of sitting in the sun, listening to speeches, and there's nothing really gained from going aside from the fact that you were invited. I'm just going to pick up my medallion later.",

It\u2019s crowded, there\u2019s not all that much food to go around, and they kept begging everyone\u2019s family members to NOT sit where the upcoming graduates should be sitting (on the lawn). \n\nThat all being said I still went because I only get my bachelor\u2019s degree once, and I wanted to experience this just to say that I did.",

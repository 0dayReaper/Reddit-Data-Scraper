On June 9th, we're taking over the Sierra Rooftop, so it's time to rally your crew, grab your favorite beverages, and get ready to get lit like never before.\n\nWe're not talking about your average campus event. This is the ultimate student-powered party, where we create the atmosphere, the energy, and the memories. It's about coming together as a community, celebrating the spirit of CSUN, and having a night you'll talk about for years to come.\n\nSo, gather your squad, spread the word, and let's make this June 9th a legendary night. Bring your own drinks, bring your good vibes, and let's show the world how we do it at CSUN. Get ready to make memories, dance under the stars, and connect with fellow students in a way only we can.",

The disdainful look on DW's face to her disheveled hair and sagging eyes really exemplifies the feeling of posting on discussions on Canvas. As a counterargument, however, I'd like to argue that discussions actually encourage real discussion. After all, when looking through the perspective of the professor, you understand the real pedagogical outcomes of such intellectual discussion. It would do you best to expand your view on the situation because such discussions really, truly, and sincerely expand my worldview! Anyway, while I agree and disagree with certain aspects of your meme, I think that overall it is very well-composed. Good job, regards, and cheers!",

    "postText": "i talked to my advisor awhile back and she sent me a file that had classes she suggests that i take in the fall. one of them is a 400 class that requires the prerequisite, which is a 300 class that i haven\u2019t even taken. she recommended that i take both at the same time in the fall but i was wondering if it\u2019s even possible to do? \n\nmy registration isn\u2019t until next month, but i wanted to see if anyone here has done this before. thank you!!",

Keep in mind, 322A is the pre requisite for 322B, however, she was able to take both because the system recognized that she was indeed taking the required class already. \n\nTry taking both anyway and if the system stops you, just take the pre-req anyway.",

            "comment": "Hello, \n\nI am a recent Interior Design graduate from CSUN. \n\nPersonally for me, the program wasn\u2019t the greatest but that could be because we were online for 2 years. But what\u2019s great about the interior design program at CSUN is that tuition is a lot cheaper then probably most other schools. \n\nIt is still a great program. I really enjoyed my time as a student. Just wish we could have used the interior design lab room more often. \n\nA few things to note, we are a really small program. Some classes are only offered once a semester so it\u2019s really important you take classes accordingly to graduate on time. Also, since our program is really small, there is only going to be 1 class option. We are unfortunately not able to choose what time we want the class or which Professor we want. \n\nLastly, I want to mention that our program updated the curriculum (for the better). Previously, your degree would have been \u201cFamily &amp; Consumer Sciences, Option: Interior Design\u201d. They just changed it this year so that your degree now would say just \u201cInterior Design\u201d. As part of the new degree, they even removed a handful of Family &amp; Consumer Science classes that we\u2019re irrelevant to interior design and replaced them with brand new interior design classes including a fun environment psychology for interior design class (that even counts as a GE so anyone can take it if they are interested in Interior Design).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions as I will be happy to answer them!",

When you say the program is small, would it still be enough to help prepare for the NCIDQ exam? I'm guessing since you graduated recently, I am assuming yes, but I just want to make sure:) Also, I heard that there is an internship included in this program. Could you tell me a little bit about that?",

                            "comment": "Your welcome. \n\nYes, there is still enough to help prepare you for the NCIDQ exam. There is actually a brand new Construction Documents class that teaches you all the important laws to follow, building regulations, etc. This course to me (and everyone I know) has really been important because it taught us so much useful information. Our instructor even told us what kinds of questions we will be asked and even gave us a sample quiz. There is also a Building Codes class where you will learn all the building codes and ADA guidelines.\n\nYes, as part of the program, there is an internship course. It really isn\u2019t that bad. Everyone in the past has always been able to find an internship and the program will even provide you with a whole database of possible places to intern at. Unfortunately, majority are not paid. For the internship class, you have to complete 120 hours (but the instructor won\u2019t know if you actually completed all your hours). Aside from the actual internship, the course meets 4 times throughout the semester and there are very small assignments including a short journal, small writing assignment, forms to will out, and a small poster at the end. You will take the internship class in your last semester so you will definitely be prepared. Also, there is a Professionalism in Interior Design class where you will create your interior design portfolio, resume, cover letter, business card, and Linkden so you will be prepared when it comes to applying for internships since you have these resources.",

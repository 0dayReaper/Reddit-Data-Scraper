Please for the love of god practice basic proper hygiene like brushing your teeth before coming to class. It's hard enough trying to concentrate during two-hour lectures when I have to breathe in your sour putrid stink waves.",

Sometimes wearing a mask helps bc you're smelling yourself\ud83d\ude02. If not, stay by the door and prop the door open. Other than that don't sit on the far wall away from the door bc all the AC's in Sierra hall point toward the opposite wall blowing whatever stank your way.

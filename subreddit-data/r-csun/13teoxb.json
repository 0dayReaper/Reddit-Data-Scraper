I hear National University is a good college to pursue for a master's degree and applied behavioral analysis is a great program to get into that has lots of career opportunities. Let me know if you want to connect outside of Reddit, we can dm if you want. I'm also pursuing graduate studies (MBA) at CSUN it's my 2nd semester so if everything goes according to plan I'll be done by late next year.",

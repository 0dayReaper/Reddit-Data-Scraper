    "postText": "I interviewed for the fall masters program and was placed on the alternate list? What\u2019s the etiquette as far as following up with the department or the odds of being accepted last minute? \n\nI\u2019m looking at other options as i want to be a counselor and I\u2019m an older student. Feel like the clock is ticking and it\u2019s making me a bit anxious. I\u2019m from the San Fernando valley. And suggestions as far as other school counseling masters options? Thanks in advance!",

What the time commitment out of class is\n\nWhich classes were most demanding?  I see that you take two classes per semester.  Is one typically less demanding or are they both crushers?\n\nAny input is appreciated",

            "comment": "I am currently in the program, began fall 2022.  I was out of school for awhile before entering the program.  It was a big adjustment.  They do give time off during tax seasons.  It's designed around the schedule of working professionals.\n\nMy impression so far:\n\nAcct 509 - this is the tax research course.  It's not hard per se but there is a lot of reading and material to cover.  You'll want to really learn this as it is foundational to understanding tax code and how to research case law - you will need these skills for your other classes.  Definitely not your hardest class.  Most of the grade is research/writing projects.  Taught by Razani.  He's a good teacher.  \n\nAcct 520 - individual income tax.  Again, not hard but a lot of reading and lot of material.  First exam wasn't bad, second was tough, final was medium.  Taught by Razani. \n\nAcct 629 -  Corporate tax.   Toughest class so far.  Professor Monica Gianni is very smart but also demanding.  Lots of reading.  Homework every week.  She breaks you up into groups and each week your group must present the solution to one of the homework problems and explain how you arrived at your conclusion.  If you are obviously unprepared she will wreck you.  It scares the heck out of a lot of people.  We literally had a couple people drop the class - I can't say for sure that's why but it was right after she mauled them.  She will help you if you're struggling.  The final (60% of your grade) is a ballbreaker.  The average was 50%.  She ends up curving it to get people over the hump.  If you dedicate yourself you will learn the material and do well.  If you don't you will not succeed.\n\nAcct 645 - Fed Tax Procedure - easy A.  Taught by Charles Cobb.  I got the syllabus and about had a heart attack - there  is SO much reading assigned.  But it's TOTALLY  unnecessary.   I read all the assignment before the first class and then realized that it was a waste of time.  Weekly homework projects that you can do in an hour.  He is an easy grader.  Final project (no final exam) worth 50% of your grade.   He's a nice man and VERY knowledgeable but his classes are a 4 hour tour of duty.  He just straight lectures and it's tough.  You have to pay attention because he'll spend about 15 minutes of each lecture giving instruction on that week's homework.  \n\nThe program, after 4 of the 10 classes, has already made me a better CPA.  It is demanding.  I spend about 20 hours per week studying plus 8 hours per week in class (in addition to my 40 hour per week job).   I have received A's so far.\n\nI will update in 10 weeks when I finish the summer session which appears as though it's going to be very difficult.",

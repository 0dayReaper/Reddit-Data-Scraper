I\u2019ve received so much stupid work and assignments I\u2019ve never had more schoolwork in my 3 years at CSUN until now. Honestly I wish they\u2019d give us less assignments and understand situations we are in. The amount of work is exhausting and it\u2019s not worth the money I\u2019m shelling out on my education for it to be a PowerPoint spoken to me for an hour.",

Is there any reason you can\u2019t work right now to save up while you can? There\u2019s a lot of students looking for room mates in the Valley. The campus also has resources available to help students like yourself. \n\nHope you are staying safe. Just know this won\u2019t last. Also check and see if the library is open or if you can reserve space to get out when you can.",

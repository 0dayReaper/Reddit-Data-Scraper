    "postText": "I'm just looking for a little clarity on the roommate selection process. My son will be a freshman next year. On Tuesday, when the roommate selection process opened, he took a look at people who were matches for him and sent out a couple of personal emails to a few of the guys, sharing a little bit about himself. He hasn't received any responses. He's not taking it personally, but I think he's a little bit bummed that there isn't more excitement about finding a roommate. He kind of assumed Tuesday would be a day full of people reaching out to each other and trying to make connections. I feel like that's how it is at other Universities. Can someone who's been through it explain how this process works and if people will start reaching out the closer it gets to the deadline?",

Don\u2019t lose hope! Either way, they do match you up with someone. :) hopefully ppl will start reaching out soon. Closer to the deadline is when ppl actually check it out",

            "comment": "Honestly, I forgot the roommate selection opened on Tuesday. I have been caught up in finals. He should give it 2-3 weeks until after finals. Also not everyone checks their email, or the emails he sent might have gone to spam. He should try to find them on social media as another method of contacting them.",

    "postText": "I admitted to CSUN. I have met all of my a-g requirements and passed them with Cs or better but I am taking AP Studio Art Drawing this year and the teacher is very tough. It would count as an extra class because I have already taken another class to fulfill my art requirement. I had a B in the fall semester but will most likely have a D in spring. Will my admission get rescinded?",

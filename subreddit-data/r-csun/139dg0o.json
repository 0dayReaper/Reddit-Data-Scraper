    "postText": "I really want to decorate my graduation cap since my high school didn\u2019t allow it, and was wondering if it was allowed at CSUN\u2019s commencement? And even if it is allowed, is it common for grads to do so? I want to make sure I won\u2019t stick out like a sore thumb :)\n\nI know our cap and gown are rentals, which is why I would make sure to decorate it in a way that is easily removable before returning it. Thanks in advance!",

Now that I'm finishing a graduate program this month, I'm doing the same thing with my cohorts. Even if it wasn't allowed, what's stopping you? It is your special day, you're the one forking over a lot of time, effort, and/or money for your degree, enjoy every moment that you can!",

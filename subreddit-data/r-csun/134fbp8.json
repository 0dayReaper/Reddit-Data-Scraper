I was so wrong, this prof made everything seem hard, she made us do all this reading for a point, and she acted like a total Karen. She was mean to a point where students have even confronted her about her behavior yet she does nothing about it. The good news was I made a ton of friends in that class because we all trauma bonded by talking shit about her \ud83d\ude02",

It was my first ever college class and it was the hardest one I\u2019ve ever taken (I graduated last may and this class was worse than my upper division classes). First off she was just a really rude person. Like on the first day when we all went around and said our majors she told me I was wasting my time going to college. Within the first month of classes she commented on my weight and said \u201cif you keep eating snacks like that you\u2019re gna gain the freshman 15\u201d. she forced us all to buy this $100 book that she swore we were gna use every day\u2026we used it once. She didn\u2019t teach AT ALL. And when u would ask clarifying questions about the assignment she would leave you more confused. She didn\u2019t post anything on canvas so you\u2019d always be super confused about deadlines cuz she would literally always change them. And like not extending the deadlines like she would always make things due earlier than she originally said, giving us even less time to do it. And like it was a freshman English class but we literally had like 8-10 page papers due every week and then she was such a harsh grader and would give everyone F\u2019s. I could go on and on she was the worst prof I\u2019ve everrr had.",

When a question came up, he\u2019d condescend us about how we didn\u2019t prep before the class and encouraged everyone to self-study the material if we did not understand.\n\nHe also spent a good portion of each lecture bragging about his prior work experience, his research, and how things were like \u201cin the industry\u201d.\n\nAll of this for a 9 am friday class when no one wanted to be there. Those 16 weeks were brutal.\n\nOn the bright side, he ended up establishing a fat curve due to all of our poor performance in the class and passed everyone, with most of us getting an A with around a 50%.

His other classes are the same:\n\nThis class is the epitome of what not to do. From multiple choice math-based exams with incorrect answers, to an ultra rushed first half of the semester even though everyone told him to slow down to which his response was \"you guys should be watching my lecture twice.\" He has the notes presented on his computer but doesn't post them, and expects us to write faster than the speed of light.He teaches something called the four A's which he doesn't even utilize anytime in his course.\n\nThe only four A's I learned were assert, agitate, aggravate, and abdicate\n\nThen he has the audacity to slow down through the second part of the course where the material doesn't even match the curriculum. He doesn't know what he's doing half the time and even his pen is lost in the class.His twitter also is filled with aphorisms and quotes used a million times by everyone, and he is so narcissistic he gives himself credit for an unoriginal quote like the one below:\n\n\"The greatest ability one has is to be anything or anyone at will!!--Matthew R #radmanesh\"\n\nHe asks for feedback after every problem, he takes 10 seconds to think of a number: \"From 1 to (random number) how did everyone do\":\n\nWhen we give feedback and say we all got 15/30, or one student does bad, he says \"very good most people did well. Let's move on.\" (note that 15/30 is 50%).\n\nHe is the worst professor I've ever had, and I wouldn't wish him upon my worst enemies.In the second half of the course, he completely deviated from the course material and his speed became that of a slug in a wheelchair because he started writing his notes live on the computer whiteboard. I feel like he didn't know what to lecture on, so he randomly started doing fourier transform which he didn't really understand in the first place after seeing his lack of understanding of the variables and parameters. He killed the whole class time and then what he ended up doing was wrong, so he told us to finish it for homework.\n\nI even asked him what does a specific variable represent and he said it's just a parameter. Furthermore when we took the exam, for one question with multiple accepted ways to solve for it, he only accepted his arbitrary way of finding the exact same lower echelon matrix, even though you could find different lower echelon matrices and they will be acceptable as answers.People aren't graded on how hard they study or work. Furthermore he said don't worry about time on the exam, but then he says you need to hurry and finish it after an hour and a half. He lies about making his exams from scratch even though we can see on his screen that he has already made it and likely recycled it from previous semesters.\n\nWHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS HE TAKES A WHOLE DAY OF CLASS SESSION OFF BEFORE THE EXAM BECAUSE HE HAS TO MAKE AN EXAM HE HAS ALREADY MADE AND USES THE SAME ONE EVERY YEAR! GUY JUST WANTS A DAY OFF!\n\nI can't even begin to describe how unenthusiastic his teaching style is, as I caught myself laughing more about the mess of a class. Overall, even if CSUN hired 80 janitors, they still couldn't clean up the mess that was Matthew Radmanesh's 455 class. Also, we wasted 10 minutes of class time on a French lesson.",

I had an F- for the first half of the semester which gave me crippling anxiety because I just wanted to pass that class as it was a GE. Even going to his office didn't help. We were still in the upper 50s but at least I was close to average.\n\nHe would ask for advice as to how to teach the class better and he just took it and tossed it into the trash. We were all saying the same thing.\n\nThis was back in 2019 and I will say that recently it seems that his teaching style has improved which is great! Still, having sleep paralysis almost every other night was not worth the stress.",

Take his classes if you love feeling absolute dread and want to lose ur will to live\ud83d\ude03\n\n His class gave me anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns at 2am from how picky/strict he graded his assignments. What I learned is: his way or you're wrong. C or worse if you stray from his idea of 'right'.\n\nHe expected students to know what he wanted to see on an assignment, yet never really explained all that well WHAT it was he looked for. First assignment he expected certain events and docked off points if it was not there? Even though he said put down what we thought was important. \nAnd knocked you down 20 points [100 -&gt;80] if you turned in an assignment he gave back to you to fix b/c it was considered 'late'?? Huh??\n\nMost people in my class got a C or failed. If he put in the last essay, I'm sure I would have passed with a C too.",

He was very hot tempered, smoked a cigar during every zoom class Monday morning at 8am and was extremely boring. He would get aggravated when people didn't participate during lectures and would scream at people. I stopped attending because I couldn't take his bs anymore but still managed to receive an A- in his class. I helped basically the whole class pass his exams along with hw assignments and I don't regret it one bit. There were a couple of students who were pregnant in his class at the time and he did nothing to accommodate these students and they had to take every single test and finish every hw assignment on time or they would get penalized. A few other notable mentions are Wayne Smith, Stephone Neely, Fareen Mehrzai, Daniel Degravel, Melanie Williams and Sigalit Ronen. Try to avoid these professors if you can.",

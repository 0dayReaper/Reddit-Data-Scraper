    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI graduated from a CA CC with an AST in Business Admin a little over a year ago. I am interested  in applying to CSUN for the Spring of 2024 and would like to major in Film Production. \n\nI have taken all courses that will satisfy the CSU GE Breadth but have not taken lower division major preparation courses, which according to the website are CTVA 100, 210, 220, 250, and ART 250.\n\nAm I still able to apply as a transfer for Spring 2024 and complete the lower division courses at CSUN? Or do I have to apply as a first year?",

    "postText": "I applied for Financial Aid and the only thing I was offered was a loan. I don\u2019t want this loan but I can\u2019t figure out how to decline it. I go to my \u201caward package\u201d and it says I\u2019ve been offered $9,500 but have accepted $0. The check box to decline is greyed out and the \u201cDecline All\u201d button does nothing. \n\nI don\u2019t want or need this loan. How do I get rid of this thing? Is it enough to just not accept it? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to auto-apply or something when I go to register next month.",

It's finals week and people are shouting in the hall, having full conversations at their desks, one guy is watching a video on his phone with the sound on.  \n\nI have ADHD, I struggle enough with focusing and I come to the quiet floor for QUIET. If you need to chat with your friends, why not stay on the first or second floor where that stuff is encouraged? Why come up to the fourth floor to bother everyone here who are trying to study?",

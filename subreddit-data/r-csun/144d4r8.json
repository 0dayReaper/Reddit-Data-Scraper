    "postText": "Maybe this is more of a rhetorical question/rant, but why is CSUN registration so dumb? It literally gives you a date to register for classes that you can\u2019t change no matter how on top of school you are. Then, you\u2019re forced into shit classes simply because some random system based on illogical variables decided that the person who didn\u2019t even know they had a registration date until the day of is more important than you getting in the classes you needed. Every year I\u2019ve gotten snubbed because people have registration dates before mine. This year for example, I still have to wait over 2 weeks when my classes in the shopping carts continue to fill up. Genuinely, CSUN, you\u2019re a POS.",

            "comment": "I have been in your shoes. It really does suck. If you have a 3.5 GPA, I highly recommend applying for the GE Honors program. Once you get accepted, all you have to do is attend a mandatory orientation, and each semester attend at least 3 GE Honors presentations, and you get priority registration. I did this, and I finally did not get stuck with shitty schedules and classes.\n\nYou also do not have to take any Honor classes! They just highly recommend you do, but you do not have too",

Seniors too i think, but i wont find that out until next semester.\n Yet everyone else and I? Practically a fight to the death.

Your registration date should be easily found on your 'My Checklist' and the registrar sends an email several weeks in advance. \n\nIf the courses you want to enroll in are full by the time you register, continue to monitor the class search daily up until week one or two of the semester. People add/drop throughout the summer and eventually will be dropped if they don't pay or didn't pass the prerequisite. For courses without waitlists, email the professor to declare interest in their course for the semester. Keep up the hope! IMHO I would not add courses to your shopping cart until a day or two before you register.",

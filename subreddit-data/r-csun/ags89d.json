So students had to go to the one of those printer places on Reseda, order it, get it made, and you pay.... \n\nIt was a fucking required book for the class. The professor then ended up completely canceling the class due to low enrollment numbers, and the book was no longer necessary. \n\nThe printer shop policy didn\u2019t offer refunds for special printing jobs like for that book.... it cost me a whopping $120 +tax. \n\nI still have it to this day and it\u2019s been like almost a decade now. I still get pissed about it.  \n\nFuck that professor. ",

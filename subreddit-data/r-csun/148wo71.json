    "postText": "I am an incoming provisional film student and want to double major in film production and screenwriting. I was wondering how hard is it to double major? Sine they\u2019re both film related I figured some of the classes would overlap and make it a bit easier. I wonder school wise how hard will the workload be? I will need to work as well, hooding to work full time and double major if possible. If not I will happily cut work hours.",

Add into that a job (part time or otherwise), and you're looking at an eventual mental break. \n\nEven if you have the mental fortitude of a Tibetan monk, you'll have zero free time to recharge/have a personal life/do anything but sleep 3 hours a day.\n\nChoose wisely .",

You could give it a try and see if it pans out. If it becomes too stressful, maybe you could consider a minor in one of those areas, and use the credits you earned to achieve that. Also, as another commenter said, it may be worth it to instead consider post-graduate degrees in one of the two studies.",

I hope I can minor in screenwriting but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an option, it\u2019s not listed under the minors ont heir website. I feel like it could be manageable tho because I feel like film classes are a lot easier to manage and require less schoolwork and are more project based. But I will be talking to an advisor this Thursday so I will ask them about it.",

I came away with valuable information in regards to learning about databases and ERD design. He\u2019s always willing to help if you ask (just don\u2019t ask stupid questions like as if you haven\u2019t been paying attention). \n\n\nA lot of other people have negative things to say. But goes to show how serious they take their education.",

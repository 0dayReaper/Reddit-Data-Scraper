The last thing I expected to find at the end of finals (besides the stiff silence while everyone recovers) was a lovely picture of a hawk (?) eating a bird, along with an itemized list of birds spotted on our campus. \nI've been telling my family that CSUN feels like one of the prettiest and cleanest \"small cities\" I have seen, even though it is in fact a humble suburban state college. You can easily forget this in the rush of the semester. It took bird spottings to remind me. Thank you! ^_^",

Just the first one is most legit.\n\nTextbooknova takes you to amazon to buy it\n\nEn.bookfi has a terrible search engine that shows books not related to what you input. \n\nGutenberg can be legit\n\nEbookee requires you to make an account which is fishy\n\nManybooks.net gives you a list of websites to visit to buy your book\n\nOll liberty has nothing book related",

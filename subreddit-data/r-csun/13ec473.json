    "postText": "I still haven\u2019t received my financial aid award letter yet which is a bit concerning. I applied March 12 (past March 3rd deadline) and will be attending csun in the fall. I tried calling the financial aid office today but it was just an automated voice message and it directly hung up the phone call. I need to start planning my finances and student loans and it\u2019s kinda hard when I haven\u2019t heard back yet.",

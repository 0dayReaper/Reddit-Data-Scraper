            "comment": "\nSo this is what I did for my years in the dorm! These are just suggestions.\n\nThe suite is only the room, with the bed, desks, and closet area, with a separate but communal toilet/shower area. However, you will need to buy your own mini fridge if you want to store your own  food. \n\nWhile the apartment already has that, with additional features like the fridge, couches, desks, stove, table +chairs, etc.\n\nBedroom: desk lamp, bed covers and blankets, pillows, hangers, pushpins. Rest is decoration, which is up to you. I say bring a TV if you want.\n\nPlease bring bug spray as some rooms have ants/spiders!!\n\nCleaning supplies: windex, microfiber cloth, broom, mop/swifter + pads or floor cleaner liquid, hand soap, bleach, ajax/other powder equivalent, 1st trashcan for the toitlet, disinfectant wipes, sponge for the sink and to clean the tub, plunger and toilet cleaner brush, paper towels, laundry detergent if you plan to wash clothes in the dorms.\n\nBathroom: bath mat to step on when youre out, towels, shampoo, shower mat for the tub, toilet paper, 2nd trashcan [optional: for the bathroom if it's an apartment], shower curtain, maybe a shower shelf, loofah, toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, face stuff.\n\nKitchen: plates, pans, cups [mugs, hyrdoflask, mason jar etc.], utensils  like forks, spoons, knives, whisk, spatula, etc., dish soap, and another trashcan for the kitchen, trash bags, sponge, and your food [eggs, cooking oil, hsm, bread etc, whatever you eat basically]\n\nHonestly, there's nothing you shouldn't avoid, that's gonna be up to you as you go. This includes what you should include as you live there, these are just what I think you'll need. \n\nBut like I said, you'll learn as you go what you need and what you don't!",

            "comment": "I mean it depends on your room. For an apartment with kitchen, you've got to bring the kitchen stuff. I highly recommend a microwave and a drying rack. Of course, your own plates, utensils, pots and pans. You also have a lot of room for clothes. I got these fabric boxes for me clothes which I kept under my bed. But of course I keep forgetting that I'm the type of person to wear the same couple of shirts on repeat and I packed ALL my shirts and pants. Took up so much space. But it might be helpful for you if you have a lot of stuff. You also have storage above your bed, hallway closet space, entryway space, kitchen space, a lot of space. For a suite, it's really small. No kitchen. You basically share the space with 31 other people (32 total). Every 2 people share a room and every 4 people share a bathroom. I heard that a mini fridge and maybe a microwave is really good. If you live on campus and you don't have a kitchen, you will most likely eat out a lot, but I think once in a while you will cherish some homemade/fresh food from a mini fridge. \n\nThat's all I can think of right now. I'll come back when I can think of more.",

            "comment": "Definitely need a mini trash can for your own room and bags and I personally recommend a rolling basket to store your dirty clothes \n\nDefinitely bring soap to wash your hands and some kind of smelling spray. The bathroom or ur room can get a little stinky since it\u2019s a closed space, you can use the spray to help with the smell or the stuffiness. \n\nDefinitely a night lamp, if your roommate falls asleep earlier than you and you still want to work on homework. It helps a lot! \n\nWhen I packed my sweaters, shirts and pants. I put them all in hangers and then I put a plastic bag over them. This was the EASIEST way to move in my clothes. I used to put them in boxes and fold them and then take them out and THIS TOOK FOREVER. \n\nAll rooms have a closet space where you put hangers, so with the bags with you move in, you can just hang them and remove the bag. \n\nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/im-moving-out-with-the-trash-bags",

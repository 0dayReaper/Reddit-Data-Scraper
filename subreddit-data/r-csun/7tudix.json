I watch street sweepers on Zelzah essentially just push trash aside instead of cleaning it up. No one is there to pick up the absurd amount of trash on the streets surrounding CSUN. That trash? All of it piles around the storm drains making its way in to the ocean and streams of the LA watershed. It's disgusting, and I just really wish more students would join in in making our community more tolerable.",

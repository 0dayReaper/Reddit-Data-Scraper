What\u2019s your cumulative gpa currently?\n\nFrom the CSUN policy catalogue:\n\n\u201cDisqualified Status\n\nUndergraduate students who were on academic notice the previous semester are placed in disqualified status if, at the end of the next semester, either their cumulative total GPA or CSUN GPA falls below the floor listed for each class level in the table below:\n\nhttps://catalog.csun.edu/policies/academic-standing-for-undergraduates-good-standing-academic-notice-and-disqualified-status/#dq-table\u201d\n\nIf you truly are disqualified, you will have to wait a semester, then you can formally (resubmitting application and transcripts and all of that) reapply for the following semester: https://www.csun.edu/admissions-financial-aid/how-to-apply/returning-admissions/returning-undergraduate-students",

I was also told that I needed to get a 2.0 the spring semester which I didn\u2019t even think twice about since I knew I would get good grades. Right before the end of the semester I find out that my cumulative CSUN gpa needs to be a 2.0 meaning I needed to get a really high gpa to not be disqualified. And this is only bc I asked the advisor when I met with them. I can\u2019t imagine how you feel. Stay positive and reapply when you can. I would also consider speaking to the advisement director and let them know that you weren\u2019t provided the correct information.",

As another commenter pointed out, if re-applying to CSUN doesn't work out, or the disqualification remains, perhaps you should consider community college.\n\nMy AA was partially paid for due to the California College Promise Grant (CCPG) and the workload was a lot less demanding. It still took me nearly 4 years to complete my time at a community college, but it was much cheaper and the stakes were not quite as high.\n\nWhatever pans out, I believe in you and wish you luck!",

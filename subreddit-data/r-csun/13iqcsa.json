            "comment": "\nHi!\nI'm a prospective applicant, like I also applied for this Fall because the program is fully online. I am a high school history and ethnic studies teacher. After taking my first intro to Chicano Studies course a community college, I learned about CSUN's Chicano/Chicana Studies MA program. The reason that the program has stood out to me is because back in the 1960s, the very first 2 Chicano Studies BA programs were at CSUN and UCSB. CSUN's program/department has been instrumental and trailblazing in this academic discipline. I think (double check don't just believe me) it's the oldest chicano studies program in the nation? Like officially because before the late 60s, there was rarely ethnic diversity in academia. There are many foundational Chicano Studies publications from this program as well as it being a program with famous alumni.\nAlso! UNM has been the only institution to offer a fully online Chicano Studies MA program so I'm very excited to have this opportunity to be a part of the program without having to move back to the LA area. I live a few hours away and am so thankful I do not have to commute or pay a lot of money for parking lol",

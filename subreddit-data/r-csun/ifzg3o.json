THEN we watched a video within that video explaining how we should open our minds and realize that bts is huge and we should be familiar with them. Also noting that we should realize that Korea is going to be the one that saves us all from COVID. Then black pink video came up. It was a really interesting class lolol. Sweet lady but Very hard to understand her accent.",

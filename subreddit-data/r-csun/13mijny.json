So check your DPR and the prerequisites needed for the classes and you should be good",

I took 356 with Hengimeh Rabizadeh online and it was a bit more challenging but still very doable, i got an 84.  \n\nI\u2019m a business management major for context. Those were the only 2 coms classes required for me, but they were both definitelyyyyy much much much easier classes compared to the rest i\u2019ve taken so far during my stay at CSUN. Wish all of them were like that",

In all honesty, my best advice for upper division GE is to stick to classes that are outside of your major department. But if you want to take the classes you can but make sure that it\u2019s for credit in the major only and not for GE credit.",

The reason why I don't recommend doing this is that if a certain class that you're taking is not only a major requirement (either upper division or just an elective class) but is also fulfilling a general education requirement, then there's a chance that the said class could only fulfill the general education credit, like fulfilling the upper division general education D - Social Sciences and/or F - Comparative Cultural Studies and not for the major requirement credit like the upper division core work or an elective requirement, which makes things a bit difficult for some students as they may be looking for coursework that fulfills both general education credit and major requirements credit.\n\nI hope that explains things a bit better.",

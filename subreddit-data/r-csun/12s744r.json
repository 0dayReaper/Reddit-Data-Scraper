            "comment": "Yeah its pretty common. It's cause there were people feeding the squirrels by staring at them and then offering food by hand at an extremely close distance. Which is why the squirrel will stare at you for a bit (waiting for you to give them eye contact) and then based on whether you look at them or not, approach you then.   \nThere is a total of 4 squirrels on campus. 3 of the squirrels will only approach you if you give them eye contact. What worked for me was to \"not\" give them direct eye contact (like pretending they don't exist). They will try to get into your line of view but you just have to continue eating your food (make sure your food is close to you) and looking away from them.   \nOne of the squirrels on campus is more aggressive and will just invade your personal space, come very very close, and sometimes touch you. That one you will need to keep your food close to you, and hold a staring contest with (without moving away from your spot). That one will try you 3 times before leaving. \n\nI spent a lot of time sitting in the squirrels' main territory (palm tree area near the library) and was able to observe a lot of their behavior. It used to be the exact opposite where if you stared at them long enough, they would get the idea that you weren't going to give them food and leave; this was back in 2018 to 2020.",

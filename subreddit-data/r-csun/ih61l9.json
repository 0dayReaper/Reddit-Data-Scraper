We're being charged the full fucking amount and getting absolute dogshit quality- at LEAST use the fucking tuition money to buy the professors a fucking tablet so I don't have to decipher the moon rune writing they have to do because of drawing on screen with a mouse FFS.",

Prepare your slides beforehand, then point and highlight.  Today, it took my professor 5 minutes to write one sentence.  It looked like it was scribbled on a bathroom wall.",

Nothing fancy, just her walking us through problems step by step. So far its been real effective.Then there are other teachers that seem lost because they are unprepared for the day's lecture. Point is, you can give everyone the tools to succeed but not everyone can use them properly",

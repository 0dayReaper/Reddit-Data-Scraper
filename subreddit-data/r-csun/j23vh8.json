So those that wanna slide will still try to slide by. \n\n+Most students wait until the last minute to do anything at all. So those that want to work will still probably wait until what they see as the last possible moment to participate.\n\n+Most group projects have a peer review form. Just keep documenting everything you do and everything they don\u2019t.",

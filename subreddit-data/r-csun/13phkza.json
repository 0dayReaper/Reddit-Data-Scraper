It was in person but they usually upload the grade on canvas and have not rn). Just highly concerned. I emailed, but I understand that the grades deadline for profs is in 3 days.",

I had a professor post an A- and I questioned it and emailed her and she said she made a mistake and put in a request to change it to A. Professors make mistakes perhaps not intentionally but I took a screenshot of what my grades were up until Friday so I had an idea of what I should be seeing once posted and before they disappear on canvas. I\u2019d say be sure to follow up and ask if you are concerned.",

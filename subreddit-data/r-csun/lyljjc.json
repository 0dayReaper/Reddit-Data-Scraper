    "postText": "There's a lot of posts about Fall classes being scheduled on-line or in-person. A lot of rumors and misunderstanding in the comments. So I'll make this quick post to actually answer that all for you.\n\nI'm the chair of the Computer Science department. I am responsible for scheduling about 180 sections of classes and 55 different instructors. So I've had to know comply with all the rules for Fall. I have also worked with administration and faculty leadership to help guide the policy decisions that have been put in place.\n\nFacts:\n\n* CSUN wants to be back in the classrooms for all traditional classes for many reasons. We desperately want all our students to be able to experience a rich and rewarding college/academic life. It saddens all of us deeply that we cannot provide you with that traditional experience at this time or share in it with you. However, the safety of students, staff and faculty is always our number one priority. We are being very careful and conservative with our decision to move everything back to in-person because of the significant risk that such a measure might pose.\n* As such, our chosen mode for Fall 2021 is either virtual classes or hybrid classes. We are not allowing normal in-person classes at this time.\n* Hybrid classes are done a couple of ways:\n   * Labs (chemistry, biology, etc.) and hands-on classes (physical therapy, nursing, etc.) and such can be offered in a manner where a subset of the students are permitted on campus. These students must comply with social distancing and sanitization procedures. The other students would attend virtually and be rotated in the next day or week to complete their physical experience. These courses might only meet in-person a few times through the semester with all other days being fully virtually. The instructor is only in the classroom on a small subset of the days throughout the semester. The rest of the days are all virtual.\n   * We are allowing \"Hyflex\" classroom models for any courses that their instructors want to do this. In these classes a subset of students attend the class in person and the rest attend at the same time virtually. The instructor gives the class in-person every single day but a different small subset is present each day. Again, all in-person students must observe social distancing and sanitization procedures. All non-in-person classes attend virtually at the same time. In this case the instructor is in the classroom every single day.\n* Instructors cannot be forced to offer their classes in a hybrid/hyflex mode. Many have underlying medical conditions that place them at very high risk from Covid-19. Many live closely with, and care for, elder persons or other people who are at at-risk. It would be unethical to force them into situations that increase that risk.\n* The state of California is ramping up and improving its vaccine supply and delivery. It will still likely take several more month to get the vaccine distributed and completed for everyone. It will then take a couple of months after that for the vaccine to have the desired affect on eradicating the pandemic. Thus it is reasonable to make our Fall 2021 decision on the assumption of the pandemic continuing until at least the middle of the Fall semester.\n* Recent pandemic numbers have been trending very positively. Many states are eliminating their protection measures and allowing things to return to normal at this time. It is unclear at this time if this is a wise move. This may result in another spike and there are Covid-19 variants in the works that health workers and specialists are concerned about. So, again, we are not counting our chickens before the eggs hatch. The CSU is responsible and would much rather err on the side of caution and keep everyone safe.\n* As things develop over the next several months things may change drastically for the better. Throughout this entire crisis the CSUN administration and leadership has worked tirelessly to track all impacts that the pandemic and government policies have had on our operations and to continuously react to new data and to make changes to our direction to achieve the best possible outcome with the highest measure of safety and the least impact on our students.\n* So, if things do improve drastically we may shift back into the classroom at any time. Even in the middle of the semester. We will only do so when we are certain that the additional risk imposed with such a transition is entirely insignificant and that we are not putting any of our students, staff or faculty or their families at risk.",

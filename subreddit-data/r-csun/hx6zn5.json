At least hopefully they can afford \"unlimited data\" $50/month for a podcast or something to listen during the commute to build their skills and career by ear. \n\nIronically getting a used car is cheaper and you like have a car.

However, they never disclosed that to student leaders or students living in housing. Failure to inform us exposed an RA to someone who was in one of those covid reserved units on a lock out situation. Thankfully the RA was not infected though. But a lot of RA\u2019s were outraged.\n\nAs far as the racist part, there is a couple community directors (supervisors to the RA\u2019s) who made odd comments. One that ran \u201cLatina\u2019s rising\u201d told a student she wasnt latina enough. The same community director also has showed favoritism to non Black students (these observations coming from Black RA\u2019s). Also, during a training week for RA\u2019s we had a day to talk about race. This day a lot of RA\u2019s had many critical things to say to housing and supervisors.  Supervisors didn\u2019t like this and later on decided NOT to rehire those same RA\u2019s who spoke out and said so. Lastly, an Academic Mentor did some borderline title 9 things to another academic mentor and made some misogynist comments. They were demoted from being an AM but were still hired to work inside the housing office lol.",

I wish I honestly had the courage like you folks. For some reason, I have this anxiety of speaking, my chest starts pounding and start feeling  my body heating up even if its on something I know about. I wish I can participate more often in class, but I just never learned how get out of this shell. Maybe sometimes, I'll say something and will regret it even if it wasn't that stupid of an answer. Again I wish i had the courage like you folks. I find myself sitting in class and thinking that I could get more out of my education if I had participated more and maybe I wouldn't be falling asleep in class. Shout out to you folks that are brave enough.",

It's not like in the movies where your classmates will laugh at you for saying \"the wrong thing\". Don't wish, simply propose to yourself to participate in just one class, once a week and keep building. Remember, even if you move an inch a day, you'll eventually traverse a mile...",

Funny thing is I used to not participate whatsoever but now it\u2019s a whole different ball game. I still could very much so participate more but I\u2019m going at my own pace. Even writing this down makes me feel nervous but I also agree that studying your material, having your notes before hand or even going over the slides helps build confidence in participation. There is no real stupid question. What makes sense to us probably doesn\u2019t make sense to others/ vice versa. Teachers are there for a reason and we are there for a reason! Just know you\u2019re not a alone and go at your own pace. Do what you want wholeheartedly and you\u2019ll get there sooner or later.",

It can be intimidating to speak in front of the whole class, but perhaps you'd feel a little bit more comfortable in a one on one setting. Try taking note of one concept you found interesting or one question you have, then talk to them about it. Although it isn't in discussion with the rest of the class, it's still a great way to participate and get more out of your education:)",

It doesn't even matter that I know most of the people in my classes, and know at least most of them aren't judgey or anything, I still get really anxious. In cases where I do answer something, I can hardly listen for a few minutes afterwards while my heart calms down.\n\nShout out to the dude who always answers questions in my classes! You are appreciated.",

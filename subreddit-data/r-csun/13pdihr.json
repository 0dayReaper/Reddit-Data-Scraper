    "postText": "Anyone got plans on what to do next after graduation? \n\nI got my degree on May 17, four years ago. I remember having an interview set up at Bank of Hope at the end of that month after going to a job fair the previous week or so. The interview went bust (as expected) and didn't get the job. I had no internships or experiences so I went back to campus and asked the career center what my options were. They offered me to continue get counseling for opportunities at a program called Workability IV which helps students with disabilities find work. It's a super long story but that program single-handedly got me to where I am today, a career in tech that I'm so happy to be working for. It took more than 2 years to land in that role but during that time, I was bouncing back and forth between finding work, delivery driving and working in a shitty UPS store with no benefits. \n\nI believe CSUN will still allow you to continue getting involved in their club meetings or social gatherings if there are any that you like. Are you planning on dropping by or are you done for good and just want to move on?",

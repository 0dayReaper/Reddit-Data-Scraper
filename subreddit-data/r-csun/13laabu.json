    "postText": "So my boyfriend is graduating from the music school monday night and did not order a cap and gown. We don't know anyone graduating from another department, i.e. someone who has an earlier ceremony. The department doesn't have any extras and told me to order one on Amazon... obviously he wants to wear the real one and have the right tassle and everything! He is 5'10\" and slim. If anyone could let me borrow theirs after they are done it would mean the world to us! I promise to return the cap and tassle in perfect condition\u2013I'm sure you want to keep that.\n\nIf you or someone you know would be down to help out please DM me. I will work out a convenient time to come pick it up after your ceremony. Please help us out! Thank you!\n\n(Backstory is that he thought he could save money and wear mine, but I graduated from USC and he didnt know mine has a bunch of USC logos all over it.)",

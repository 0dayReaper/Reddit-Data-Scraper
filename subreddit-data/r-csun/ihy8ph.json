But teachers taught off PowerPoint even when it was in class. \n\nPeople pay $3k tuition whether they go to class or skip it and fail. It\u2019s a sunk cost. What you\u2019re paying for it that piece of paper. Whether you actually learned anything or not will matter when you\u2019re working somewhere. \n\nThe moment you look at this situation that way. The more you can stop worrying about it. Because you and I are like millions of students going through the same thing",

At this point if bearing with PowerPoint is what I have to do to earn my degree, I'll do it with a smile. There are plenty of tutoring resources available so you don't have to teach yourself everything. Things could be so much worse. An attitude of gratitude helps a lot.",

I know things could be much worse, however it\u2019s okay to realize when you\u2019re getting shitted on. There is nothing wrong with not being content about paying $3k+ in tuition to get taught via pp. However, because I need my degree I have to accept what I have.

Lots of businesses are getting screwed over big time because of Covid...universities shouldn\u2019t be untouchable, and should still be trying to elevate the means of education in whatever appropriate avenues/methods that they have access to. \nIf I had a professor that just gave pp, id probably try and rally up the rest of the students to at least get some recorded lectures or something",

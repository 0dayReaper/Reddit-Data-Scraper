    "postText": "* If you're in STEM, consider dropping by the Learning Enrichment center located in JD 1600. There will be tutors who will be able to assist you in many different classes including Math, Chemistry, Physics, Chem, CIT, CS, CE and more. \n* If you don't mind adding a few minutes to your commute and save some extra cash, consider buying an F10 parking pass which is exactly half the price of other parking spots. There's a shuttle that regularly transports students from the parking lot to the center of campus every weekday from 8-5pm. Otherwise, it's about a 15 minute walk which isn't too bad. You may also found the shuttle helpful if you live in the dorms since it stops there en route.\n* 4th floor Oviatt library has text books available for rent though it's not guaranteed you'll find the book you want there. If you absolutely cannot afford to buy your textbook at the Bookstore, consider renting one from the library. You have a good two hours to scan pages with your phone if you want to do your studying home.\n* There's a resting area where you can enjoy complete quietness and a good nap at the Oasis Wellness center which is below the USU. \n* Every student gets ten dollars worth of free printing and copying credit. One copy or print is 10 cents. Consider visiting the computer lab located at the Bookstein Hall 2129 where there are terminals you can use to browse the internet and copy/print papers.\n* You can get a free resume review and feedback at the EY Center located in BB 2224.\n* Career Center is in BH 413 and that'll be the place to go when you are looking for an internship, experience, and job opportunities. The earlier you go there, the better.\n* Matty's closest which is in the career center will give *FREE SUITS AND SHOES* to students once a semester. Disclaimer: Most (if not all) of them are second-hand but they're in pretty good condition and suitable to wear at an interview.\n* If you're feeling troubled and need counseling, consider dropping by the UCS located at BH 520. They typically do once a week for 1 hour. \n\n\nFeel free to ask anything not listed here.",

People park on them over night and have no problems. \n\n\n\nOasis wellness center is a great place to de-stress after a long day of classes. They have full body massage chairs, nap pods, Zen gardens and just chairs to relax in. All free unless you want a actual massage. Make sure to book the massage chairs and nap pods a hour ahead of the time you want to use them(call the center to book them)\n\n\n\nKeep a eye on matasync online for up and coming events to have fun and get some free food. You will also see signs sticking out of the grass everywhere offering events.\n\n\n\nUse myCsunSoftware for free Adobe products plus other software\n\n\n\nPlaces to eat would be the arbor grill(open till 9pm) next jacaranda hall, they have custom salads, burgers, chicken sandwichs, and pastrami sandwiches averaging $8 without drinks. Or if your near housing(next to parking f10) there is Gerominos which is a unlimited buffet open from 7am to midnight for $12 a person.\n\nIf your in the mood for Subway, El Pollo Loco, Juice It Up, or Panda Express, find the csun textbook store and right next to it are these franchises.\n\n\n\nIf your in the mood for coffee there the csun version of Starbucks everywhere around campus called Freudian Sip. \n\n\n\nThe manzanita hall has a small art gallery if that is to your taste and right next to live oak hall is a planetarium, but you have to call up for when there shows are.\n\n\n\nIf exercising is your thing, the src center behind the university student union is massive. They have a huge selection of fitness equipment including but not limited to a rock wall and a pool. They also include registration for non-competition based sports. \n\n\n\nIs the gamer inside if you wanting to be released?\nGo find the gaming room across from the src to get your game on. For any console gaming and table tennis, it is $3 a hour. For billiards, the price starts at $4.20 for one person, and a discounted rate for more!\n\n\n\nDo you plan on using a bike? Around campus we have complementary bike shops where we help to keep your bikes in great condition. If you also register your bike with the on-campus police department, you are given the opportunity to lock up your bike in set surveillance centers for safe keeping.\n\n\n\nAs a matador you also get plenty of discounts!! \nCheck out [link](www.csun.edu/as/matador-discounts) to see how you can save at local stores and amusement parks. \n\n\n\nIf you plan to park near or at f10, there is a shuttle that arrives near the metro stop that will take you to the south side of redwood hall next to jacaranda hall for Free! Be warned, it is about 15 minutes between shuttles and about 12 minute transit time\n\n\n\nAvoid buying textbooks, try libgen.io first and search by author for your textbooks.\n\n\n\nFor clubs and frats, pick the type of life that works for you. Though if you are of the jewish religion, there are a lot of options club and frat wise for you to become integrated in\n\n\n\nYou can print 20 free pages a day if you physically go to the the University Student Center but if you are on the go and in a ruch, find a PrintAnywhere booth and you have $10 worth of printing on your account pre-loaded per semester.\n\n\n\nAre you hungry but the food you brought is cold? Travel to the University Student Union where a microwave is provided for your use!\n\n\n\nAlso, feel free to join our discord (discord.gg/sdqFafm) where we will be happy to answer any questions",

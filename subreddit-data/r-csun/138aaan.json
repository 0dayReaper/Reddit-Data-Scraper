Instacart is really convenient but can get really expensive sometimes. I also tried walking to the nearest stores like Ralphs and Vons and that was like hell, especially if i got a lot of stuff. Having a car definitely helps out!",

I.e. the fabric bags handed out on campus for the food pantry and such. I fill those bags and walk with them back to the dorms. Around 30 minute walk. Might be more if I have a lot of heavy groceries. It is heavy but I manage and that means a lot coming from me. I am overweight and have zero ounces of muscle on my arms. \n\nBut... I remember growing up in israel, my grandma had a little cart for grocery shopping. It's like a rolling laundry basket but it is made of fabric and is actually for food. I would recommend that if you don't feel like carrying your groceries. For reference, you can Google trolley shopping cart for groceries with wheels.\n\nEdit: I usually spend 200 a week on groceries. But I also cook all my meals at the dorms and don't buy out.",

Besides instacart you can also try amazon fresh they deliver it right to your dorm on a scheduled time.",

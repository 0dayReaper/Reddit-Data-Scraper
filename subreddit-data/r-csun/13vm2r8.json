    "postText": "Hello Metador! I am a newly admitted student for fall 2023 and I am interested in hearing about the Accountancy program here. I am looking to probably study Finance/Accounting/Operation. CSUN is fantastic and I have visited here several times.\n\nI have also been admitted to UCLA for Business Economics major and USC (Marshall school of Business) for Business Admin Major. However, I didn\u2019t know too much about these schools. How does CSUN compared to UCLA and USC in terms of the business majors? CSUN is a bit more affordable than UCLA btw.",

There is a TON of exposure to firms.\n\nYes, if you want to spend $300k and you can get in, go to USC.  Then you can work alongside kids that went to CSUN.\n\nI'm currently in the MST program.  It is excellent.",

You will have 0 problems getting an offer if you aren't completely neurodivergent and actually join a club and recruit. On top of that accounting major sign ups is at it's lowest in several years so you will have the least amount of competition. \n\nIf you don't already have a strong drive to do something outside of tax and audit then I would say USC or UCLA have virtually no better reach than CSUN at an absolute fraction of the price.\n\nMy personal advice, go to CSUN. get your bachelors cheap. While you are waiting to start grind the absolute shit out of the CPA instead of taking time off and you will get your bonus, and with plenty of firms there are options for them to pay for your masters at.....USC! Then go get your masters and have everyone cum when they see your random USC gear.",

Assuming he wants to make more money and do more interesting work, going to those schools would give him more opportunities since CSUN isn't a target school for anything but tax or audit",

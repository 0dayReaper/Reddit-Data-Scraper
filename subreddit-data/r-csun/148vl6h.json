As long as you meet the requirements, applied, and were approved, you should be able to walk.

I walked on stage in May 2022 and still took a summer class. I received my diploma probably in November rather than the usual August.\n\nIn your case, you can walk in spring 2024 even if you have a class in the fall.",

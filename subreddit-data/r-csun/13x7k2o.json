    "postText": "So I recently applied to to traditional teaching credential program at CSUN, I had already gone through the interview on May 17th they had let us know it was going to be up to 3 weeks to hear back. However, I wanted to know if anyone else had any experience with the application process from start to finish to see if it really took up to 3 weeks or if I need to contact them for a follow up. Thank you very much for any assistance!",

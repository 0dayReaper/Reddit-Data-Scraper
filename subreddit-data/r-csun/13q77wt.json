I\u2019m looking right at it!!  \n\nGrades are already submitted so I\u2019m not able to reach him!!!\n\nWhat should I do???  I already graduated last weekend!!  I know I shouldn\u2019t care because I still passed but this is gonna affect my GPA!!!\n\nWhat are my options to address this issue!!?",

But students are able to petition these sort of things right?  I already graduated last week but since I\u2019m still gonna go to grad school, it\u2019s still a big deal to me!  Thanks for the feedback!!!\n\nDo you know if Professors still read their emails/messages before summer break?  I\u2019m scared there\u2019s nothing I can do!!!",

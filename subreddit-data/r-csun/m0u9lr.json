    "postText": "Covid has been hard on all of us. Some more than others. It has been a year of staying inside and behind a camera. No socializing on campus, no hanging out and getting boba.The effects of covid-19 has been studied worldwide, and I am not just talking about getting the virus itself but the consequences of the isolated living we have had for so long now.\n\nWe at the CSUN Discord are trying to help students to cope with the new reality we are living in while the world adjusts to dealing with the multiple strains of Covid being fought against.\n\nCome hang out and make some new friends. Here you can chat, socialize, get help with homework, hear the latest about CSUN and much more. We also have partnered with several clubs for advertising so you can see all there events  being hosted all in one place.\n\nHope to see you soon: [https://discord.gg/t4Mw8m3](https://discord.gg/t4Mw8m3)\n\nWhen you join the server make sure to type your Major, Current Year(Freshman, Junior, ect) and whether you live on campus or not. The mod team will then let you see the rest of the channels.",

I transfered from NYTech to CSU as a sophmore and now I'm thinking of taking a semester off, but is it possible for me to do that at CSUN as a transfer student?",

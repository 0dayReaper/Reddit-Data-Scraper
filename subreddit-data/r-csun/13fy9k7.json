    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a Junior Management student thinking of pursuing an MBA after graduation. I see online that scoring well on the GRE/GMAT exam is a requirement to apply for all of my top choices. I really have no idea as far as timing how I should go about this, whether it\u2019s realistic for me to not have a gap year or even take the GMAT this year, and what work experience is required or anything about the general process. The info i\u2019ve found online is too vague. \n\nI\u2019ve been connected to like 6 different offices and nobody\u2019s really been able to help me. Though I am interested in CSUN\u2019s MBA program, I want information about the general process to ensure I have options when applying. \n\nI just want to speak with an advisor about my questions, like is it normal to pursue an MBA right out of undergrad considering I have 3 years of relevant work experience, will universities immediately turn me away due to my age (21)? I\u2019m having trouble finding guidance and I don\u2019t want to take a gap year but I don\u2019t know how realistic that is. I have a lot of questions",

I was once eating a subway sandwich outside Siera hall on one of those tables, I notice this squirrel come close to me from the side, so I tell it to leave. I did not notice his friend come around and steal my sandwich, I was pissed off at first but after a while I thought it was funny, but realized they do work together for food, they are not afraid of people, and they do run around in the parking lots I used to see many of them get run over, or just block cars from leaving parking lots because the driver did not want to run it over, They would literally just eat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the way there are ducks there or used to be not sure, they can be violent to so be careful",

I was also eating subway around sierra hall and one of the squirrels jumped from the tree onto the ground and came really close to me. We had a stare down for a while and then he finally gave up. But that wasn\u2019t the first time. I\u2019m always having stare downs with squirrels. They are vicious. They will stand mm away from you until you cave",

While I was on a tour, my family got snacks from the Mercado and these squirrels were absolutely *feral* trying to get their hands on food. It was a nightmare hahaha\n\nAnother time, my roommate got a bagel from Starbucks and the squirrel just took it when she set it down to toss her trash. It was awful.",

A huge sum of invested money that I have to admit I don't know enough about how it works to support campus activities.\n\nThe higher-ups get their raises through stupid state legislation and board of trustee decisions and this happens whether or not we get any donations at all.\n\n&lt;sigh&gt;this post will probably get me fired.&lt;/sigh&gt;",

But when it comes to the endowment I'm way out in the deep end. The University Corp. (runs all the food and commercial ventures which legally needs to be kept segregated from the state tax funded educational mission) is also a pretty big mystery to me. The college and department budgets I think I have pretty good handle on.\n\nBut yeah, we're state employees. nobody gets bonuses of any type and its pretty much impossible to embezzle or abuse fund accounts for personal gain without someone publicly noticing immediately. But it's pretty easy to convince the board of trustees that the latest and greatest administrator appointee needs a bigger salary to stay \"competitive\".",

Yes, there's some problems but you find problems anywhere, even MIT, etc.\n\nYep, they could be betteer... but we do a GREAT job with what we are given.\n\nTake this into account and consider it:\n\nCSU Northridge and UC Berkeley educate and graduate about the same number of undergraduate students.\n\nabout 50% of CSUN's budget is provided by state tax dollars but only 14% of UC Berkeley's budget is provided by state tax dollars. Sounds like the state is favoring CSUN right? WRONG. CSUN's budget is a little over $400m so our state appropriations is about $200m. Berkeley's budget is $2.4 BILLION! so their state appropriations is $336m. You could almost run the entire CSUN operation with what the state gives Berkeley for doing the same job. (Yes, it's the same job when you are talking about undergraduate programs, graduate programs we can have a different discussion about.)\n\nSo add on top of that UC Berkeley gets to charge twice as much in tuition and what you have is that the UC system gets to spend about 4 to 5 times as much per undergraduate student as CSU Northridge does. So with 75% less resources we do a f\\*cking FANTASTIC job!\n\nSo, my question is: When is the California State legislators going to stop literally discriminating against the demographics of students that attend CSU campuses? At the very least the state appropriates per undergraduate student should be the same for all CSU and UC campuses.",

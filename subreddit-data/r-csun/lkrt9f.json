                    "comment": "I would really like to see changes in resource allocations for my department. Most of my students have a hell for registration were all the classes are full in the first day. The other departments get more favorable class seat allocation. I'm allowed to open up classes after registration through a process called augmentation and the central university will cover that cost. But that means those classes aren't available until a couple of weeks before classes start or even in the middle of the first week. This isn't fair to students to not know what their schedule is until that late. It also forces many students to incur additional costs by trying to complete substitutable classes at local community colleges (This costs them more because all the units above 6 at CSUN are just flat rate, 17 units vs 7 units is the same cost).\n\nI also have fewer tenure track faculty (professors instead of lecturers) per student than almost every department except a couple across campus. It makes scheduling classes very difficult and think you deserve permanent, full time, Ph.D. qualified professors.\n\nSome good news on both these fronts. I was able to get a much better seat allocation for Fall. I think it's inline with the number of students I have. So I think students will have far less frustrations in registering for Fall 2021 than they did for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021.\n\nWe are hiring more tenure track positions. Normal the campus hires between 60 and 100 new professors each year. Due to Covid we put a freeze on all but the most seriously needed positions. This year the campus only allowed 19 position search to take place and Computer Science received 2 of those. I need about 10 more than that but you can't realistically hire and integrate that many at once anyways.\n\nI would LOVE to see state legislators actually understand what CSU is, the fantastic demographic of students that we serve, the benefits that it provides the state and how cost effective is. The UC system charges students more than twice the tuition but also receives about twice as much state appropriations per student than the CSU receives. So UC campuses operate with about 4 times as much funding per students for undergraduate course instruction. They also get to cherry pick the top students so they never have to actually help students like the CSU does. But the state financially treats us like the middle child and it's a large part of the reason why you students encounter so many frustrations about \"why don't we have X?\" So I'd love for the legislators to actually place the right CSU dollar amount in the budget. Not just for my department but for all the campuses and disciplines across the CSU. The UC budget for just the 9 UC campuses is approximately the same as the CSU budget which covers 23 CSU campuses. Go figure.",

He then allocates that however he wants to the five department chairs under his authority.\n\nBefore getting too worked up. It appears he listened to me. The Computer Science allocation for Fall 2021 has been increased to 713. Since Fall 2020 was 620 and Spring 2021 was 606 this is a 17% increase in our allocation.\n\nIt puts us with an allocation that is very fair compared to all the other departments and our students demands. All our CECS students should have the same experience during registration regardless of their department.\n\nAnd frankly, I would have a hard time justifying a higher allocation myself. The Fall 2020 actual demand turned out to be 705, The Spring 2021 actual was 695. So I have a good feeling that this allocation of 713 for Fall 2021 should cover our demand very well and I will have to do very little work to open more classes late or increase seat caps. Unless we are way off on our enrollment predictions students should actually be able to get into classes during the actually registration periods.\n\nI often tell students to send polite complaint letters to the Dean's office or the Provosts office when they've screwed up. It's your voices they listen to, not mine; I'm just their minion to do as I'm told. To be fair you should send also send a polite thank you letter when they do things right. This would be one of those times. He really came through fairly on the Fall 2021 FTES allocations.",

The language is just a tool to learn. The real meat of Computer Science is the \"how\" and \"why\" which is independent of the language and far more important. I started in FORTRA, the world changed to C or Pascal then to Modula-2 (in less than a semester) Then PERL, C++, (LISP and prolog on the side as toys) then Java... PHP, Go, Python, haskel. You'll see in your career... the language doesn't matter. It's a screwdriver, doesn't matter if it has a red handle or a blue handle.\n\nSo the other classes don't focus on programming so much as HOW to program. How to manage or function with a team of programmers. What are the limitations and architecture choices. What risk and situations do you have to consider and prepare for in a project. How do you communicate this all to clients and get them to buy in and pay for it.",

(Normally, faculty are assigned 12 units of teaching each semester. If they bring in enough grant dollars for research they can \"buy-out\" their teaching time with the money and we use the money to hire a lecturer temporarily to fill their spot while they do research. Though most professors interested in research just keep getting different grants and buying out their time. At a private \"Research-1\" school the \"professors\" pretty much do just this and almost never teach a class. At these universities almost 100% of your undergraduate classes are taught by part-time lecturers or graduate students get paid to cover classes from research grants.)",

                    "comment": "Great question and one of the most frustrating aspects of my life.\n\nLet's start with online schools with \"infinite seats\". Such as ITT technical college and University of Phoenix. About a decade ago during the Obama administration the federal government actually decided to start enforcing a law on the books.... Educational institutions are only eligible for federal financial aid packages if their graduation rates and retention rates are high enough. Well, guess what happened when you put sign up 400 people for the same class with the low cost of just a single instructor? Nobody passes. Lots of people don't come back after a class or two and drop out. ITT and Phoenix lost all their federal aid and basically collapsed. Just prior to this CSUN was pushing us faculty HARD to develop these sorts of online classes because they saw the dollar signs. Luckily this enforcement happened first and made us go... \"Oh... that's not going to bring the gold like we thought it would.\" Mass instruction online doesn't work well and being able to be taught is not just about having a seat. The instructor should be spending time on individuals and being able to actually connect with the group.\n\nSo, now waitlist. I don't recognize you personally and don't know if your a CS/CIT major (we're on reddit so I'm guess yes.) The seat/course availability is all about \"FTES\" Full Time Equivalent Student. Take your number of units enrolled and divide it by 15... that's how many FTES you are to me. Student Bologna, if you will. Every college is given an FTES limit they can schedule classes for. Every college allocates that further to its individual departments. And that's what I can schedule classes for.\n\nFor Spring 2021 (now) CS' target was 606. I wound up needing 700. So roughly  15% of all my demand went unmet during registration. Was this fair?? Heck no! Other, unnamed departments were given targets of 402 and only needed 390. I certainly could have used that 12 FTES instead, that would have allowed me to provide two more entire classes before registration rather than opening them late or you guys having to beg for permission numbers.\n\nWhile other department chairs were suing January to build the Fall schedule I was scrambling still trying to augment and fix the CS Spring schedule. I wound up adding 31 entire sections of classes and labs. I also raised the seat caps on another 35 sections.\n\nSo basically the answer to \"why waitlists\" was because we are forced into limited resources.\n\nThe finance chair was right. I was trying hard behind the scenes but you still had a frustration to deal with.\n\nPermission numbers are an instructor agreeing to do additional work beyond their contract amount for no additional pay. So some may not just find that fair and won't provide them. Department chairs can't force them to. It's a union workforce. Some professors wait until they know how many students are looking to crash. When I teach, If it's one or two I'll add them around week three if they have attended class and show they are dedicated and really need it. But if the number is 20 then that's just not fair to me either and I'm not going to play favorites and pick a couple to add while screwing everyone else. I'm kind of an \"If I do it for one person I HAVE to do it for all.\" Some a lot of professors will be like that. Be polite, be dedicated and ask anyways.\n\nBy the way... The CECS dean came through for me... I estimated my Fall 2021 FTES need at 713. I got an allocation of 700. So I think I can do MUCH better on providing more opportunities for Fall 2021 and we shouldn't be as screwed as were were for the 2020-2021 academic year.\n\nYes... The online/zoom access prior to actually being in the class is a disaster. Emailing professors is unreliable. You can't get into their canvas page automatically to see the link they often post there. The waitlist in SOLAR don't help because they don't tie to you to any online/zoom resource. The best I could do was enroll you all in the \"Computer Science\" shell canvas course and provide a spreadsheet there that all instructors could edit. Far from ideal (some instructors from time to time treated the spreadsheet as personal and wiped it clean everyone else's info, LOL).\n\nSOLAR is also incapable of providing waitlists for any classes that have a linked lab. So it can maintain a true waitlist for COMP424 but it can't for COMP182/L, COMP122/L, etc. I really need those waitlists to see were demand is so I can open classes promptly. But SOLAR fails at this. I don't have an answer for your zoom info. There just wasn't a system I could dream up that both the instructors and students would be guranteed to navigate.\n\nHowever, I for Fall 2021 I want to have on of the COMP490/L Senior Design teams take on a Waitlist PHP/Laravel application for all department courses. Login in with you credentials and tick the classes you are interested in waiting in. I would get great useful data for what I should open or push the seat cap up on and get funding for. I would know exactly how many people are waiting for classes regardless if they have a lab or not. We could build in zoom publication feature for instructors so that students on a waitlist could get a reliable publication source/notice.\n\nWow. long answer. sorry about that. Your question triggered me. I had so much trouble this past two semesters trying to solve this problem for students in any reasonable way. And I'm a guy in computers... I'm \"compelled\" for real solutions. Like, lose sleep at night level.",

                    "comment": "Sure. First professors come in two flavors... Tenure Track (formal title of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor) and Temporary Employees (Lecturers).\n\nTenure Track are full time, dedicated to the university and almost all disciplines require a doctorate degree to be qualified. They have responsibilities in addition to class instruction that include research, publications, graduate thesis student and administrative work running the all sort of aspects of the campus. They tend to be costly in terms of salary by comparison to lecturers.\n\nLecturers are generally part time employees (some are full time) and their only responsibility is course instruction. The minimum requirement for lecturers is typically a Masters degree in their field. They are often working an industrial job as well and can have lots of industrial experience to offer. They are far less costly to teach a class compared to tenure track.\n\nTo be a lecturer all you need to do is be qualified and submit an \"AA-6\" application form and your resume each academic year.\n\nTenure track is much more complicated. The university has to offer a tenure position to a department. You can't just hire them because they tend to be with you for thirty to forty years and you have to manage that kind of salary cost. When a department has such a position to fill they advertise the positions in a variety of educational sources. The applicants submit their curriculum vitae and application for the position. This application period is open for at least six weeks to collect applications.\n\nOnce applications are received a committee of 3 to 5 current tenure track professors in the department review and evaluate the candidates. They pick around 12 to 20 to have a first phone interview with. The candidates are interviewed and then evaluated against rubrics based on their answers in the interviews. From that poll about 4 or 5 that are measured the most qualified are brought into campus for in person interviews. These interviews last all day, 8AM to 5PM. The candidate interviews with many different individuals including Department search committee, department chair, the college dean, open forum for students, open forum for faculty and they are required to provide a lecture/presentation. All of these interviews result in feedback. The search committee then provides recommendations on strengths and weaknesses of each of the candidate to the college dean. The dean in term takes that into consideration and provides their recommendations about strengths and weaknesses to the campus president (though usually their designee which is typically the provost.) The president/provost then makes a decision as to who from the recommendations to hire.\n\nIn the end the search needs to be validated by the Personnel, Planning and Review Faculty Senate Standing Committee and the Chief Diversity Office of the Office of Equity and Diversity to make sure that all procedures were followed properly.\n\nThe job offer goes out and the dean negotiates salary and specifics with the prospective new hire and if an agreement is reached then we have new candidate.\n\nThat process was probably a lot more involved than you suspected. But it's very necessary because once a tenure-track person earns \"tenure\" (usually after their sixth year, when they typically are also promoted to Associate Professor) they cannot be fired without some sort of very, very serious infraction. It's a system in place that makes sure that I can teach you that world is round even if my employer or the state believes it to be flat. (Look up what happened to Galileo some time). So you have to be very careful to committing to hiring them upfront so you make sure you have the right person.\n\nLecturers can't earn tenure but the union contract does provide them lots of automatic protection. It's very complicated but basically if I'm a department chair I have to assign classes to lecturers who have worked 6 or more years before I can assign them to lecturers that have only taught for the past couple of years. Really hideously more complicated than that but you get the idea.",

Some lecturers are necessary to absorb dips and swells in student enrollment demand but for the most part all of your professors should be dedicated to academics and been through the same rigorous hiring process.\n\nComputer Science only staffs about 25% of it's classes with tenure track. We're hiring tenure track though because administration sees were underwater on that statistic.\n\n(CS had 10 tenure track people retire all in the span of about 5 years which is a large part of how we got in this situation.)",

COMP110 is syntax stuff and just getting past complier errors. For loops, if statements, variables that all fundamental stuff. COMP182 though jumps into actually problem solving and creating data structures. It's not really an \"evolution\" of COMP110 so much as it is a whole new ball of wax. Comp182 is more of an introduction to COMP282 than COMP110 is to COMP182.\n\n2) Different instructors. You almost never have the same instructor for COMP182 as you did for COMP110. Different teachers all have different styles and one of the nice things about being a teacher is the autonomy and authority we are given to do our jobs. We don't really have a \"boss\" and thus we can teach classes almost anyway we want. I as chair can't really tell them how to do their job either. So just when you figure out how the COMP110 instructor operates and what they require we dump you into COMP182 with a different person to please.

So our curriculum is geared to take somebody with a brain and innate talent but has never programmed a single line of code or built their own computer from parts and get through either a Computer Science degree or a Computer Information Degree.\n\nBeing ready to take Calculus I when you get here is a really strong thing to have under your belt. CS is a bit math heavy (if you hate math or just aren't good at maybe consider a CIT degree instead. Equally comparable career opportunities and pay just different responsibilities). Lots of students don't place well enough to immediately take Math150A (calc I) and this means you get to take MATH102 and Math105 first... so that puts the calc I and CalcII classes in your second year. You need Math150A to get into COMP282. In a perfect worl COMP282 would be in your third semester. But if you have to take three math classes first... You're already behind a semester.\n\nSome other things to consider. If you want to cut down costs some of the community colleges offer a \"STAR\" transfer degree for Computer Science. You basically take 2 years of Community Colleges course work and when you transfer it into CSUN you've completed all you General Education and the first year of Computer Science. CSUN is cheap but not as cheap as community colleges.\n\nAnyways... comfortable with Computers and have any understanding of programming, even if it's just \"Hello World\"... then you're more prepared than the average CS entering CS student.",

Crypto is heavy in math, though most issues arising wrt crypto vulnerabilities have to do with the implementation of crypto in software rather than flaws in the math side of things. These vulns generally manifest due to a combo of a lack of secure software development and inadequate penetration testing.\n\nCryptologists/cryptographers are generally CS folk with heavy math backgrounds. More advanced stuff can be done in hardware, which is more CE with a similar math background.\n\nIT could, for example, configure established software to use different crypto to comply with policy, but everything else--development, maintenance, testing--is done by cryptographers; i.e., computer scientists.",

(Lately I've really taken a liking to JavaFX because it makes a really convenient system for creating small GUI applications to automate portions of my job concerning employee data processing and such.)\n\nHere's why...\n\nA) I'm old. Those that have been in class me... I'm way older than you think. I learned programming when the only functional language of any import with LISP. In fact Objected Oriented programming was just emerging from research into the corporate world. So I'm biased just based on past experience. (GUI...  I grew up on X-Windows MOTIF. Yeah... go look that up and come back to me with a walker and a old-folks home brochure.)\n\nB) It's hard to make a functional program fast. When you are talking about trying to maintain a data structure and use it without having any side effects occur it basically means that you are passing copies of the lists around. Making those copies is time consuming. Or the structure needs to be made atomic in some other way with locks and such and those slow things down.\n\nC) I know how to correctly program distributed, threaded, parallel programs in imperative or objected programs so I don't need to rely on functional programming handling that for me.\n\nBut.... we are in a distributed application world. Almost all programs benefit from multiprocessor architectures these days. Programming in objected oriented languages correctly without inducing race conditions, shared data problems and such is incredibly difficult. I know how to do it but it still results in a lot of bug hunting a increased development time to make sure it is correct. Functional programming... BOOM! done. don't really have to worry about parallelizing things. So I can see the benefit in it and should learn it better. But as I said... I'm old. I'm useless to teach you new modern stuff. That's why we hire bright young new whipper-snappers for you each year. ;-)",

            "comment": "I understand we have to be exposed to different programming languages throughout our degree but how come there isn't a baseline language that we use so we can get good experience in a certain language ? I'm a senior,  I have 1 more CS upper division class (fall because it was full ) and two math courses I need to finish, and I've been exposed to so many languages but haven't really gotten down one. I was very proficient in C++, because at Valley College that was the main language all CS courses used, I got my AA and two Certificates in C++ , but I haven't touched the language in three years or since I've transfered to CSUN. Ever since I've been at CSUN it's been java, c#, c, dr racket, and several other languages but each of those I've only used one semester because one teacher will say I want this done in Java then another teacher will say I want it in C, then some teacher say I don't care just as long as it works. I've been jumping from language to language, I have the concepts down pat and I know once you learn one language you can pick up other ones easy, but now that I'm starting to look for work they want you to be proficient in a certain language not good at a lot of languages. Now I'm finding myself over the last 6 months using udemy and edx to fine tune my skills in a certain language. But it's like shouldn't my school have got me more prepared ? Or is that just the nature of our field constantly evolving.",

                    "comment": "Our \"base\" is Java. COMP110, COMP182, and COMP282 should all be taught in Java. But your question is nuanced and complicated. The field of CS has grown considerably in the past 30 years. We have only 120 units with which to prepare you. And 25% of that somebody else decided that you need a whole of collection of General Education material to succeed in life. The problem is that the discipline has about 1000 units of material we could draw from. And the majority of that material was discovered in the past 30 years or so.\n\nSo, when I went to college you could focus on programming languages. And you could spend more than one or two semesters on each one. But now you need to know about cloud technologies, You can't just learn GUI you need to learn web apps as well. Which of the many frameworks should you learn? They all have pros and cons. It isn't just about programming anymore. It's about software development. Managing teams. Planning and implementing proper testing procedures. Capturing and encoding client requirements correctly. We have to prioritize security, performance, usability, ADA compliance.\n\nSo we're stuck. \"Programming\" or a language just become a very small part of the entire body of work that you need to know. And so it looks marginalized amongst all the other topics that we have to teach you through the few years we have you here.\n\nIt's also a perception item. Programming looks like the thing you need to learn. But it's really just the basic first thing. And Programming isn't \"A\" language. It's more of mindset and skillset. English isn't \"A\" language it's just one way of expressing abstract concepts stored in our heads as chemicals. You can do that with many languages but at some level  they all have subject, verbs, etc... Programming languages are similar. They express abstract problem solving in ways that can be automatically compiled in a way the computer can understand. Instead of nouns/verbs you have conditional  execution concepts, loop concepts, data structures. The language you use doesn't really matter. The real thing I'd like to see you learn in the classes is the abstract and problem solving concepts and how they work and combine to create a product. What language you use to express it really doesn't matter.\n\nLanguages change all the time. My most proficient first language was \"C\" (and they also made me switch amongst half a dozen languages in college as well.) Now, I'm very much Java. In between I was C++. Now, much of your world seems to be embracing Python or Go. (I have no idea how python got so popular. I dislike it but that's a rant for another comment.) So whatever we teach you, or whatever you learn... It probably won't be what you do industry ten years for now. But you WILL be using all the same techniques, concepts and problem solving skills. You'll just be doing it with a different language, that's all.\n\nSo: We have too little time to play and learn together before you have to go make it in your career. We have too many subjects/topics to squeeze into you. I have to give a little taste of everything as the best preparation I can. Which language isn't really the important thing to focus on. Focus on what you're doing with the language.",

But I'll try to provide a professional explanation.\n\n1) This field is a constant learning curve. For the rest of your life you're going to be learning new tools, techniques, subjects you hadn't needed before. And you're going to be n your own. There aren't going to be professors available you can pay to \"teach\" it to you. Companies will just expect the product to get built and they aren't going to put an educational system in place for you.\n\nI had a student placed with Northrup Grumman. I supervised her internship. I asked her how she's doing. She said: \"They have me programming in HAL! No one taught me HAL. Where you suppose to teach me HAL?? Do you know what it is\" I said: \"I've heard of it. No, we didn't teach it to you. not part of the curriculum\" She said \"How the heck am I suppose to program in HAL?. I replied: \"But you're doing it right?\" She answered: \"Yes\". I asked \"How did you figure it out?\" She said: \"I had to learn it from the textbooks in the corporate library.\"\n\nI said: \"What I taught you was how to find the books, gave you the skills to identify the right books from the wrong books and the ability to understand the material in the books. Nothing is beyond you now!\" ;-)\n\nSecond, You live in a brilliant world. Google, wikipedia, infinite online tutorials and videos. All professors are limited. We have flaws. We only know a small subset of everything our selves. We hold different values for the importance of things such as \"Listen to me, do what I say and obey me\" to \"I value independence and self learning as more effective.\"\n\nEverything you hit in school should feel like a challenge. Every topic in every class should feel unknown/\"Why isn't this class being done like other classes?\" Aside from the risk of drowning in the analogy the best way to learn how to swim is to jump into the unknown.\n\nI know it feels like the instructor isn't supporting you. But they are providing an environment where you can jump in without drowning and if you screw up there isn't any real negative consequences.",

    "postText": "Specifically (kinesiology)  Guys I'm so triggered unsure if alot of you guys deal with this out of kin, but the advisors/ counselors are the most disrespectful useless people I've ever encountered.\n\n So a few years ago my counselor was Dr. Sanguita Dube she was a total bitch. I had meetings a few times and everytime never got the help I needed. Once I did a walk in I was like oh hey my name is ..... are you available to have a meeting rightnow regarding enrollment? She was with her daughter or something she said \"uh sure\" and then she was like oh I can't log in so can't help you. Like huh?! I had to drop out that semester cause I never could get the help I needed and wasted gonna take bs classes.\n\n So fast forward I've taken 2 prereqs and plan on taking 1 more during the summer (at community college) and these are all prereqs for my new classes I have set to enroll in for this semester. My enrollment is in 2 days and I've been panicking. So I just got off a zoom advisement meeting with Rocio the advisor. She's just as useless this bitch gave me the rudest tone and basically professionally told me to get fucked and talk to csun admissions. I don't understand? Why do they treat students that HAVE to come to them like this? Why do they choose this job? And why are they so bitter??? \n\nMy amazing academic advisor that I emailed first about my enrollment issues is currently on vacation i got on automated email back and then he still replied and told me to contact the kin department for enrollment codes! I didn't expect a reply on his vacation at all but seriously he's the only nice one I've delt with.\n\n They honestly should fire these advisors Idk what happened to Dr sanguita but I'm glad I don't need to deal with her anymore. My point is don't stay at jobs you hate especially if they involve helping other people and their futures. It's not our fault you choose the wrong job. Does anyone else go through this?",

They don't understand that when we go to them, it's bc we really need advise on what to do. I've been with maybe four so far and only one of them was understanding and empathetic.",

            "comment": "They are so unhelpful!!!!! I\u2019m in kin too. Both of them have caused me so much anxiety. I had taken classes at different schools and asked them if I needed to retake them at csun. Both of them said I still had to. I found this odd so I talked to the department head who said I didn\u2019t have to take them. So basically both advisors almost made me retake classes wasted time and money. My enrollment date is 6/16 I need to talk to someone. I was thinking of talking to the one assigned to me? Paulo manchetti I think. Have you heard of them?",

Then I decided to switch majors to business and they were nice and efficient. Super helpful and I never felt judged. Maybe you could request a different advisor? Good luck :/",

They said they\u2019re either the best or complete landmines, and here\u2019s a few to avoid. I finally enroll and look at the wrong ID number so I think I got a good advisor. Turns out I got one of the ones I was told to avoid at all costs. The other advisor told me he\u2019s good at getting back to people because some don\u2019t even do that, and all but confirmed what I had heard about the guy. I shop around a bit because yknow I don\u2019t play around with bad advisors and land on Booth, who is a relatively recent graduate from another school so he\u2019s still fresh enough to Get It. Dude has been a wonder, wish everyone was like him. He doesn\u2019t take people who request him though, so hope you get him if any ME ppl read this",

            "comment": "For Kinesiology specifically, there are professors who are also advisors by option that aren\u2019t Sanguita or Rocio, based on the last three digits of your student ID number. You can look on the CSUN website to see who\u2019s your advisor, and ask them instead. It should also be posted in Redwood Hall where the athletic training labs are held.",

I might not be against having to redo my classes since they're gen Ed.

I'm really not sure how to best protect myself at the moment. I also had a feeling we wouldn't be coming back but I also have a feeling online learning won't work out. To many things we aren't prepared to do online. So I'm really thinking we're gonna have to choice between having a withdrawal or not really learning things for classes that can't yet be taught online.

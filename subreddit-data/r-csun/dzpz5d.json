Alumni giving is indeed higher than ever during her tenure by on average 10 million a year during her tenure.\n\nhttps://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/university-news/csun-alumni-and-friends-set-new-giving-record/\n\nPlus, research funding is also higher, it is around 35 million on average. CSUN recently also got 3 million from NASA.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/CSUN-Receives-3-Million-from-NASA-to-Study-Artificial-Intelligence-563643431.html%3famp=y\n\nAlso, graduation rates have been rising at CSUN, especially the 6 year rate. The 6 year rate is now around 55% compared to 45% a few years ago, the 4 year rate is pretty stuck around 14 percent. But people have been taking a higher course load in recent years so that will likely move up faster soon.\n\nhttps://www.csun.edu/counts/graduation-rates.php\n\nSo what did she do so wrong?",

Almost all professor I have had, had doctorates from the UCs, Stanford, or other elite U.S. universities. Some have an accent, but they are always understandable. I took one accounting class with someone who ratemyprofessor says had a horrible accent and was super hard. She was totally fine (I am not a native speaker so I would have noticed if it wasn't) but half failed the class simply because they were too lazy to do the work or could simply not deal with the level at university. Apparently they take it out by writing bad reviews.\n\nSo I feel you are really over exaggerating here.",

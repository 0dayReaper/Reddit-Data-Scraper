If you are immunocompromised, if you have an underlying conditions that you aren't aware of, you can pretty much kiss your own ass goodbye.\n\nWe're now finding out that even though healthy 30-40 year olds don't typically suffer from the same ailments, COVID-19 (The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) can take different forms in those people, [which may cause strokes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/24/strokes-coronavirus-young-patients/). In 30 year olds. \n\nChildren and adolescents who have recovered from COVID-19 are now developing [Kawasaki's Disease] (https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/86393) at an alarming rate, causing the deaths of two children. \n\nIf we open things up too early, we risk sending the R0 (infection rate) of the virus back up to over 3, when it's currently just barely above 1, right now. For reference, [Swine Flu has an R0 of around 1.5, while SARS-CoV-2 is between 3 and 6.](https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number#covid-19-r-0) This means that, if everything is open, and you get SARS-CoV-2, you are probably going to spread it to at least 3 people, maybe six or more. On average. It's a pyramid scheme in the worst possible way (and this one actually works, unlike that company your old high school bully tried to recruit you into to \"make money from your phone...\")\n\nAdditionally, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is sitting at a around a 3.5% rate, while the flu is &gt;=0.01%. \n\nThis virus isn't \"as deadly\" as we actually feared because we shut everything down to prevent further statistics and to enable our hospitals and health-care workers time to prepare for a prolonged pandemic. All of the models show that if we open things up too soon, we're gonna have a second wave sooner than expected and we'll be back in the same boat as before: shutting everything down, again, and waiting for things to settle.",

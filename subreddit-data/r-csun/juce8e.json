I\u2019m not retaining anything. I\u2019m not making friends or growing my knowledge, I\u2019m just working to do the work. Especially classes without lectures/zoom meetings.  \nAnd spring semester is going to be online... I\u2019m a transfer student so I hope I get to spend at least one semester on campus. /:",

It's just so odd that the professor would say on the syllabus that the exams are open note and open book but then choose to make it difficult for people to access their notes/the book. What about the students who only have one device? Lockdown browser shouldn't be a thing in this class (and in general, that shit is 2 steps away from being ransomware and I hate having it on my computer).",

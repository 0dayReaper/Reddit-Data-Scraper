    "postText": "I am kinda freaking out right now because my DPR says I am short some credits for graduation (I was under the impression I was going to be completely finished after this summer). I meet with my advisor twice a school year to make sure I have a plan and know exactly what I need to do, i don\u2019t know how this could\u2019ve been missed. My grades are posted and I see my most recent courses on my DPR, but maybe they\u2019re not added to total credits yet? Helpppp:(",

Let me know if there's anything I can help with and maybe we can chat over zoom to discuss. I would have to see your DPR to understand where your current progress stands and to figure out what remains.",

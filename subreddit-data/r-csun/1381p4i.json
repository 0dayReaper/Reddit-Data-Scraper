Also maybe this will help you out but when I talked to the representatives who run the commencement ceremony at the gradfest, they mentioned to me that even if 1-2 of your siblings don't have a ticket, they still have a high probability of being let in. The only thing is they would probably have to wait like 10-20 minutes until more room becomes available. It's certainly worth a try if you can't get another ticket on time. Best of luck and hope all goes well!",

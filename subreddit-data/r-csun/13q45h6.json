    "postText": "Hey all!\n\nI just graduated yesterday (yay), and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to go ahead and go for my masters. I know I missed the priority deadline, but there\u2019s still a little time left to apply. \n\nAs a recent graduate, do we still have to go through Cal State Apply like a new student? On CSUN\u2019s website it says to apply there &amp; apply with your individual program, but not sure if that applies to current students as well.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "You are no longer a current student and need to apply on Cal State Apply. The question will probably ask if you are continuing from CSUN and prompt you further but yes, as you move forward to your Masters go with the mindset of being new.\n\nEdit: Please keep in mind that although you received your degree from CSUN, that does not guarantee acceptance and you should consider applying to other CSUs or universities as well as CSUN to increase your acceptance chances. Just saying from experience.",

There were a few I was looking into, but they require some professional work experience :( I\u2019ll have to look a bit more\n\nBy any chance do you know how to go about sending transcripts? I know it\u2019s through Parchment, but I just do CSUN to CSUN?",

That could be different for your department but that\u2019s what I know for my department. If it\u2019s a school outside of CSUN then yes, it\u2019s official transcripts.",

If your GPA is a 3.0 or above then you need fill out the GRE/GMAT waiver with your application.

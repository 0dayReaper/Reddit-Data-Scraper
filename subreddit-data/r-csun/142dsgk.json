    "postText": "Hi, I received an email about the Multi-Factor Authentication, so I decided to set it up. However, my student portal has shown me that I already had Duo Mobile (which I did) and to select phone numbers. I selected my phone number to send the passcodes yet I didn't receive any passcodes. I've tried so many times yet I never received any passcodes. Phone calls also fail, and I have no bypass codes. I also cannot change devices or numbers unless I enter passcodes and such. \n\nMy Duo Mobile screen also just shows \"Use QR code\" or \"Use activation code\". I don't have either of them. \n\nI emailed the IT Help center but they just sent me an email about my ticket number to see in the Self Service Desk which I CAN'T SEE UNLESS I LOGIN TO MY PORTAL, WHICH I CAN'T. \n\nI am seriously unsure of what to do and panicking heavily. Is there anyway to change the settings for the Duo mobile stuff? or are there any other places in csun that I can contact to inform about this problem that I'm facing?",

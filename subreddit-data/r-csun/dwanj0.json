The company\u2019s park them on the border of the school and people ride them in. \n\nFor a time campus police was collecting them when on campus and corralling them at the police station. But that was too tedious because of the catch and release situation.",

I opened the app, loaded my account with $5 balance, and then tried to activate a scooter that was apparently parked in a bad area. I tried to start the scooter, but it wouldn't run because the area it was parked it was not allowed by the app. Somehow it was there already.\n\nBasically it charged me $2.00 to tell me I can't move the scooter \ud83e\udd23",

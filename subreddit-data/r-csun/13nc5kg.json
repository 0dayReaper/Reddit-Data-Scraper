    "postText": "hello, everyone.\n\nrecently i checked my financial aid award, and it says that i have an expected family contribution of more than 7,000!! last year, my efc was only around 400 and i qualified for the pell grant. and i have been receiving a pell grant for almost 4 semesters now because our family income is low. so i am shocked by how much my efc significantly increase! but my parents\u2019 income did increase to almost 80k and im so scared i will not receive any financial aid because i have no money and can\u2019t pay out of pocket.\n\ni really rely on my financial aid awards to pay for everything or else. if i don\u2019t get anything, i can\u2019t pay for my tuition and textbooks. \n\ni am wondering if this happened to anyone? did you receive anything with this amount of efc? or did you end up paying out of pocket? if you did, how much? and how can i possibly lower this efc? and do i actually have to pay 7k? my family and i don\u2019t have that money. :((\n\nthank you for the help.",

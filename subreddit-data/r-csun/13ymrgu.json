IMO it would depend on your career goals, how long you\u2019re willing to stay in school, What you want to do with data?\nDo you know the difference between Data Science(Analytics) and Data Analysis? \nA lot of these terms are used interchangeably\nSo I\u2019d think it\u2019s good to have an baseline understanding and then a direction to go about. \nI am minoring in DS too but I am thinking of dropping it and coming back for a masters emphasizing in DS once I have an established career in Data Analysis. \n\nCurrently I am minoring in Math along side CS. \nA lot of the classes CS majors take cross over with math; If done in a certain order Cal 3 could be the only extra class needed to get a math minor. If you still are interested in a type of minor. \n\n[Analysis vs Analytics](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/data-analytics-vs-data-analysis/)",

If you are not able to matriculate through the prescribed 4-semester Film Production Option sequence starting in the Fall 2020 semester, then you must notify joel.krantz@csun.edu asap so that we can make your seat available to another student.\" During orientation it was also said that if you don't stick to their four semester outline you will be removed from the program (however finishing in three could be okay I believe). \n\nHowever! I'm hoping given the unprecedented nature of this situation, they could make an exception to this rule. But realistically, I know how complicated it would make things for them if they let us take this next semester off (could screw over future prospective Film students; this is another discussion in and of itself but I digress).\n\nWhich again is why I hope they can either move our production classes (Intermediate Production and our Skill Emphasis) back a semester, or if Film falls under required on-campus teaching, then we at least wouldn't be screwed out of our practical classes.",

With Cinematography though you'd either take the Short Film Screenplay class or the Producing class your 2nd semester (since there's only one Cinematography course unfortunately). \n\nDepending on your emphasis maybe you could take both skill emphasis courses in one semester? During orientation it didn't sound like you could though. I'd strongly suggest speaking to Nate or Joel to ensure you can finish in two semesters if you haven't already.",

I believe not having that face to face interaction diminishes how well we absorb the material. Obviously, every major is different and some can thrive more in this type of online environment but nonetheless can still thrive in in-person classes as well. We should not be looking at it as \"we are still getting our diploma.\" After a university/college career, I would expect all of us to be better human beings with different perspectives and better understanding of the world. I want this rather than us just having something extra to put on a resume. I most likely will not be attending for this reason.",

It certainly wasn't the same as in-person courses; however, I believe many students aren't even cutting an ounce to the faculty and staff and giving them some credit where credit is due.  This wasn't an easy transition, especially for those faculty, staff, and students that do not normally take online courses. \n\nI'd like give my professors the benefit of the doubt and think that they are least tried their best given the dynamic situation at hand.  A different perspective and understanding of the world would be to see that there was effort put in by the university to do their best with this.  \n\nI can understand why people are upset but I am not.  I'm sad not having a graduation but this semester was definitely made to be the best that it could've been in my opinion.  You don't have to agree with what I think; however, I think far too many people are complaining about something that I do not think they could've truly handled better than the university has so far. \n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

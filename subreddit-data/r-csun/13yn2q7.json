    "postText": "Hey I\u2019m a prospective student looking into getting my MFA at CSUN for screenwriting. I got my bachelor\u2019s degree at UCSC in film and digital media but wasn\u2019t able to make any long lasting connections for networking partly due to covid but also due to not being too close to Hollywood during my undergrad. I\u2019ve been out of school since Dec. 2021 and graduated last summer. I live like an hour out of LA and as such haven\u2019t been able to work or network out there and have been stuck at a dead end job. Would it be worth it to go to grad school at CSUN, is the program good for networking and for pushing my skills as a screenwriter to the next level? Or is the program mostly for people looking to teach?",

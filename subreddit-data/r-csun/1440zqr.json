    "postText": "I was enrolled for spring semester until 2/21/23 when I decided to drop out. Before I dropped out, I went to the Financial Aid Department at CSUN, because I had already received a check from FAFSA for my semesters tuition, but my student account on the portal said I had 0 outstanding dues. I went to double check to see what I do with the FAFSA money, and they advised me to keep it and cash it and that I would just have to pay it back when the FAFSA payments start, which shows that its not until 2026 in my FAFSA account portal. I then had them make sure I didn't owe anything and they confirmed my outstanding dues were 0. I recently received a letter from CSUN saying I owe the school $4800+ dollars. I went to Cash Services, and a man told me that since I dropped out after the drop-course deadline, that they charged me 1% of my tuition from the day I REGISTERED way back in the beginning of December. I have never heard of this policy and am worried that i'm going to have to pay an extra $1400 for going to school for like a month.",

If they are acting based on their own policies, then you owe what they say you owe. \n\nIf you are no longer enrolled anywhere, your loan repayment will begin six months after dropping all classes, so you're actually looking at starting payment in August 2023 unless you enroll in 6+ credits at a college or university. The 2026 date was based on what your college was reporting as your expected graduation date, but is no longer valid if you're not taking classes.",

            "comment": "If you don't enroll in any other colleges, FAFSA will start charging you in August. This is because the loan payments are deferred while you're enrolled in college (and they estimated that you would graduate in 2026, so they were under the impression that you would still be in college until then) and then kick back up 6 months after you are no longer in college. Since you dropped out in February, I'd imagine they'll be knocking on your door in August.\n\nAs for CSUN's additional fees, you do indeed have to pay that amount. Unfortunately, there is a penalty applied when you drop out after the drop-course deadline.\n\n[Please visit this site](https://www.csun.edu/financialaid/what-affects-my-aid) and click under Withdrawal From the University to see more.",

                            "comment": "i'm in my final semester this fall with 1 class remaining\n\nwithout a doubt, some of these professors are unhinged idiots, and teach either useless or completely outdated information\n\nIf you're doing radio frequency or transistor engineering, you're in luck because the single best professor, Dr. Jackson is teaching it (his class is very difficult, so be prepared to grind hard), and Dr. Ou for transistors (jackson is better, but Ou is still structured and will answer your questions)\n\nIf you're doing power systems, it's a mixed bag with radmanesh who is an unhinged scientologist who keeps talking about his books, and Berhe who is a very nice guy, but has extremely unorganized lectures.\n\nFlynn is knowledgable and if you have any classes with him, you're in for a blast because you'll learn well and be entertained by his stories.\n\nIf you're going into digital (FPGA/ASIC), you'll be taking 520, 524, 526, and/or 527 which use VHDL/Verilog/SystemVerilog.\n\n520 and 524 are devilishly hard classes as you go into them doing design, and not learning as the prof expects you to already know all the foundational principles. If you know it already, you will do well and be rewarded as the things you do in that class will be things you do in the industry and you can be guaranteed a job, especially if you go to office hours and milk the professor for all he knows (Prof. Mirzaei). If you get prof Saba, he's an ass because many lazy students took his class and he got pissed at them, so instead of overhauling the course to be more intuitive to learn (the previous courses leave students underprepared), he just became a hardass, give him a miss and take mirzaei if possible. Saba is still a good resource, and he is easy to talk to and still explains things to you if you press him and he sees that you're trying, but just don't expect him to go easy on you if some unexpected shit happens and you have to be in the hospital for half the semester.\n\nFor 526, you'll likely get Orod, who teaches it as an intro to Verilog as there is no lower level verilog class. If you like or do verilog, this is an easy class but also a waste of time. \n\nI haven't taken 527 as I pivoted to software engineering, so once i finished 526, I was out and all I have remaining is the final math class, ECE 480 Control Systems.\n\nAs for intership opps, the chair, Geng is constantly emailing us with many job or internship openings, majority paid but some unpaid, but quite a few are defense or govt related so you may need a citizenship or a security clearance.\n\nEvery spring, there's a techfest where EE companies have booths where you can give your resume to and ask questions, however their answers are relatively shit and give boilerplate crap, such as when I asked total compensation and they didn't want to answer (I found the answer online anyway as Cali requires it to be public). My friends got internships from this year's techfest for the summer, and their resumes are all very doable for someone on Master level.",

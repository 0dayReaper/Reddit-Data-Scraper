It\u2019s kinda like the same transition when it comes to high school to college but it\u2019s a bit more dependent on yourself.",

As far as picking classes, there is a Road Map for your major. Find it and use the catalog year for when your started at Community\u2026 prerequisites can change all the time so it\u2019s important to lock into that date. Start working with your DPR and plan your degree. You can map the whole thing out and be done in 2 years!",

However, you must also consider that the classes you take at community colleges, right after high school, are going to be in the 100-200 range. Upperclassmen transfer students who are in university are going to be held at a different standard.\n\nThe biggest difference was figuring out the tech on my own. The website's UI for community college was way easier to navigate and basically did all of the course planning for me. I was able to see my progress, register for classes, make payments, etc. easily. CSUN's system, on the other hand, is a nightmare. You would think a university would have a course search/planning/registering website a little more integrated. It looks and operates like it crawled out of 2003. Super annoying.",

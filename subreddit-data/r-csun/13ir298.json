    "postText": "hi!\n\ni\u2019m in community college and will be applying for transfer starting this upcoming fall. CSUN is one of the top 3 schools ive been considering (next to SJSU and CSUF, but i havent been able to find really anyone talking about the quality of their art programs. \n\ni\u2019m perusing a bachelors in art, with a focus on animation / game design. is there anyone in the program that is willing to share any experiences they\u2019ve had here, positive and negative ? are there lots of other art students? are the facilities \u201cmodern\u201d enough?\n\nthanks !!",

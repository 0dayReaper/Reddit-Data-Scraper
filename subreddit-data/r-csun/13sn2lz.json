    "postText": "Hello there!\n\nI\u2019m planning to apply for Spring 2024, and I was wondering if I can still apply as a freshman student even tho I took 3 courses at a cc out of state?\n\nI\u2019m planning on not disclosing that I went to a cc as my grades were really bad, and just with my high school grades. But what are the chances that the college finds out? I\u2019m planning to apply for fafsa and be possibly enrolled in the WUE",

Idk if that makes sense. But in a community college I believe you do have the opportunity to remove classes that you\u2019ve only taken once.",

Good thing is that my cc is on another state, but I\u2019ve heard from someone else that when they run the fafsa they can find out every other previous college that I\u2019ve attended? Don\u2019t know how true that, but I\u2019ve never filed fafsa yet, so I don\u2019t know how do they verify that",

I will definitely! \n\nSomething that confuses me is that other universities don\u2019t usually care if you apply as a freshman student if you have taken a few courses in a cc, but csun seem to care idk why. Will give it a try\n\nAnyways, thank you!",

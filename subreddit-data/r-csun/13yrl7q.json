Or do I have to wait to graduate with my first Bachelor\u2019s Degree before I can apply?\n\nThanks so much!",

I had a 3.6ish GPA overall, but I got all A\u2019s (except 1 class) in the required pre reqs and I had a year of healthcare experience, but I do know a good number of people who had no experience in medicine beforehand. Use your personal statement to shine. And how am I doing? Lol I\u2019m surviving \ud83d\ude02 the nursing coursework is definitely doable though!!",

It recalls the early 2010\u2019s format, which historically involved specific wording that was then changed to fit the context of the unique posts made by internet memers. The original bugs bunny meme template involves the unfinished phrase \u201cI wish all _____ a very pleasant____\u201d which can then be filled in with specific terminology. \n\nIf anyone ever makes a history of internet memes hmu.",

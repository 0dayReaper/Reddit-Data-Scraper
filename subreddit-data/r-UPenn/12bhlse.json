    "postText": "I am keeping this pretty vague because I am seeking advice on the general academic environment and atmosphere for graduate students at either institution.\n\nI will be pursuing my PhD in social work this fall and am having trouble deciding between UChicago and UPenn. I feel extremely lucky, fortunate, and grateful to have the option to decide between such great institutions, but as the April 15th decision deadline quickly approaches, I constantly find myself growing more conflicted.\n\nI would love any advice, feedback, thoughts, in terms of UChicago vs. UPenn, what helped you make your own PhD decision, important factors you considered, etc!!! Thank you so much in advance!\n\n(Despite the names of the programs being slightly different, they are very similar programs in terms of being schools of social work and social welfare policy.)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12bhlse)",

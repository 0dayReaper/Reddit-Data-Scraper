    "postText": "I\u2019ve been accepted to the MES program and was hoping to know what the program is like and if there are good opportunities available to pursue interdisciplinary research. Especially because it\u2019s mentioned that 59% of the cohort takes it up part-time, I was wondering if the student community is as vibrant.",

            "comment": "Current MES student here, graduating in a few months. Congrats on being accepted to the program! \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve enjoyed the MES program, but you really have to know going into it that it does not follow a typical thesis or research-focused master\u2019s program. It\u2019s a course-based professional master\u2019s with a capstone project that you create and manage yourself. Research opportunities depend on what you\u2019re hoping to research - for example, the program has a lot of students in the sustainability concentration, and that research is really well supported. Other disciplines are still encouraged, but resources available may be weaker. Also, some people come into the program with no idea of their capstone while others have a fully formed project in mind - both are just fine. The research you decide to do is entirely up to you, but that also means there\u2019s no guarantee of having supervisors for your project who are experts in your field. \n\nDeciding if the MES research opportunities are right for you also depends on what you want to get from your program - again, this is not a thesis, it\u2019s a project. If your further academic or career goals absolutely require a thesis-based master\u2019s, it\u2019d be best to look elsewhere. For me, I\u2019ve found that the skills I\u2019ve learned from carrying out my own self-directed and independent research on a topic of my choosing have been really valuable to building my career, but it doesn\u2019t fit for everyone. \n\nAs for the student community, it\u2019s in part related to what concentration you\u2019re in as that will determine who you tend to cross paths with the most in classes, but in my experience there\u2019s been a lot of opportunities to get to know people through events hosted by the school and also by students. For example, the department hosts a coffee hour meet up once a month. There\u2019s also a program-wide group chat that\u2019s regularly got event invites, job postings, and commiseration about capstone work. And while many students are part-time, some of them are just as active in social events as full-timers.\n\nThat\u2019s what comes to mind right off the bat, hope it helps!",

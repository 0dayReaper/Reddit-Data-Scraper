            "comment": "Hey! We are subletting a 4 bedroom and 4 bathroom apartment at The Radian for this summer from May-End of July. We are currently paying about $1.7K/month per person, and we would like someone willing to pay about $900-1K/month; however, we are also flexible with negotiating the rent price too. In addition, we don't mind if you are the only party subleasing, and we are okay with all the way up to 3-4 people subleasing the place at once. The Radian is a well-known apartment at Penn and offers luxury amenities and helpful maintenance service if ever needed. Please feel free to DM me if you want to discuss pricing and see some pictures of the place. Thank you!",

Emt and future Pa student here. \n\nI can\u2019t say for sure, but look into:\n\nKeystone quality transport, might be free if you do some work with them. \n\n\nOther options:\n\n\nGood fellowship\n\n\nVirtua \n\n\nI think Drexel\u2019s program is closed, but worth a check. \n\n\nIf you really want the cert quickly, there are boot camp programs on the east coast, but you would need to travel and the tuition would not be cheap.\n\nDo NOT do some school called something like all pro by the airport. They charge insane tuition and too many of their students fail.",

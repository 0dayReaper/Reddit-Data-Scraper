    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm planning to do the PFP program this summer. I'm also planning to follow the pre-med track. I have to take the math diagnostic for them to determine the math course I will be placed into during PFP. I know the math diagnostic usually doesn't mean anything and is just a suggestion for what courses to take, but I'm not sure if this is the case for PFP since it seems like they place you into one of four courses (labeled A to D).\n\nI didn't find AB Calc necessarily difficult in high school, and looking back at older posts on this sub, people have said that if you took calculus in high school, you should take math 104. However, when looking at the descriptions for the PFP math courses, they state that people with a strong background in AB Calc would take Math C, which would prepare them for Math 103. \n\nI'm a little confused because the description for Math D states it covers derivatives, applications, and integrals which we learn in AB Calc and Math D is supposed to prepare you for Math 104. However, the description for Math D also states that it is for students who have taken BC Calc and feel confident in their background. \n\nDoes the math diagnostic score actually determine which of the four math courses I will be placed into during PFP or is it also a suggestion? Does the math course they place me into during PFP determine what math course I have to take at the start of the year? I feel like I'm past learning limits and derivatives (Math C) and I'm decent with integrals and stuff so I should go into Math D, but I never took Calc BC and I heard the math diagnostic has a bunch of Calc BC stuff which I probably would not do good on.",

I am a math major and i got rear ended by 104 and 114, and I actually like math.\n\nEdit - i\u2019m not pre med so I have no clue, but I have heard pre meds saying they are just doing 103. Talk to an advisor, and look at your major course requirements. I think bio major requires 104 and 114 iirc\n\nAlso, the math courses at penn are totally different than ap courses in HS. Not necessarily content-wise, because AB roughly covers 103 material. I struggled in 103 (i ended up with a B though because it was curved at that time. They are no longer curved), yet I got an A+ in AB.",

I took Calc AB in high school and it was easy.  So I opted for Math 104.... I got absolutely destroyed, and after landing in the D/F range after the second exam, I withdrew.  I just wasn't prepared for Penn's level of rigor.  \n\nMost people will go from Calc AB to Math 104.  Not entirely sure why they are suggesting Math 103 unless they are just trying to set you up for success by playing it safe.  Especially if you're pre-med, this may be a prudent option.  Your GPA is too important.",

I'm not sure if I need 104 eventually or if just having 103 is okay. Like would people that take 104 be \"ahead\" of me in any way I guess? I am fine taking 103 only if there's no real reason for me to take 104 other than an interest in math (which tbh I don't have really) or pride",

Everyone here is super crazy and competitive, and so you'll definitely find a lot of people assuming that the more advanced the level, the better.\n\nWhether you need 104 (or higher) may be a function of your major more than anything.\n\nI'm not pre-med myself, so I'm not going to confidently state anything other than what the advising program has listed on its page!",

By this I mean the ability to work for or to found your own startup at a university. Can anyone give me some insight into penn\u2019s startup programs, as from an outsiders view, the school seems heavily business oriented, with not much engineering reputation.",

The reason that elite private schools are revered is because of the amount of funding and resources they have and while flagship state schools can top subject rankings due to department size, the undergraduate experience will remain superior and better funded colleges. \n\nLike you can argue about it all day but a college that spends 100k per student will provide better resources than one that spends 40k per student, it's just reality.\n\nExplain to me how a class with 1500 people can be as well taught as one with &gt;200 (that's just some intro level classes at Penn and some grad level CS classes).\n\nSource: I also turned down Berkeley EECS and do not regret it one bit based on what my friends tell me about it.\n\nPS there are a couple of things at Berkeley that might compete, namely Math department (ours is garbage) and weather.",

We have opportunities like VentureLab and Pennovation where if you have an idea, you can nurture it into a working business model. There are also hackathons and awards like PennApps and the President\u2019s Engagement Prize that allow for this. There are people who also drop out to do startups full time. For example, there\u2019s a group of Penn dudes building a decentralized cryptocurrency market place and they\u2019re based in center city. Berkeley is cool with the silicon valley proximity and all, but nothing beats being exposed to the most driven people who I wholeheartedly believe you\u2019ll meet here in Penn. There\u2019s a reason why we are the #1 or #2 spot for the most billionaires in the country, whereas Berkeley isn\u2019t.",

Berkeley is probably solid too in this regard and I wouldn't know about that, but I can't really imagine many places being that much more favorable to student startups or entrepreneurship than Penn. I have lots of criticisms for the school but that is the one thing that I would single out as a particular strength of Penn.",

This is especially evident watching CS faculty here have a relatively more difficult time trying to create startups (compared to what I saw at Berkeley).  Berkeley has one of the best incubators in Silicon Valley, SkyDeck, directly affiliated with the school.  And most EECS alum go on to make it into top incubators such as YC.  I would also say from my observation that the EECS department is much more startup motivated than the CIS department here (considering both faculty and student).   Lastly, Silicon Valley proximity is important for a whole host of reasons that perhaps fields an entire different discussion.\n\nI know this may get downvoted since this is Penn\u2019s sub.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love this school. In reality, if you are motivated enough, you can succeed in startups at either place, but the opportunity is better at Berkeley.",

            "comment": "So i\u2019m a student at neither of these places (though i strongly considered berkeley, but I have founded and exited startups with backing from top tier VCs and angels, and I have also spent time in VC. \n\nUPenn M&amp;T is pretty fire \u2014 know some really smart guys/girls out of that program building cool stuff or otherwise chasing cool opportunities.\n\nThat said, I think a lot of the penn students here, either due to not having been in the game or being prideful, are overestimating/hyping the entrepreneurial     environment and startup world clout @ penn. Someone here was bragging that upenn has the biggest eship lab in the world. First of all, doubt that is even objectively true. Second of all, are you really gonna tell me that Penn can even begin to compare to the entrepreneurial resources/culture found at places like stanford/harvard/mit or even berkeley for that matter lol \u2014 can tell you that\u2019s a hard fucking no. Thirdly, i can tell you from experience that the guys who are building actually cool/promising shit are very very rarely found at their school\u2019s \u201centrepreneurship lab\u201d. Shit like pennventures or pennovation or whatever the fuck that even is is a net zero value add at the end of the day.\n\nAs per the \u201cwharton\u201d clout people are throwing around\u2026 no one in vc/startups gives a fuck about wharton. If anything, lots of ppl look down on wharton/bschool kids. Wharton is for IB/PE/consulting hardos and its network outside is a drop off. I think the m&amp;t program in particular lends itself to some unique credibility in certain circles (maybe that\u2019s just my sample bias though cuz i certainly respect m&amp;t kids), but even then those guys will tell u that wharton was useless and a waste of time.\n\nListen, Penn is just in no way the engineering/startup hotbed that berkeley is. In a raw sense, I personally don\u2019t think there is a program in the world that will give you the technical foundation that EECS will, save for maybe MIT. Berkeley is synonymous with tech/startups in a way the more preprofessional penn just isn\u2019t. When u think startup schools, literally nobody is going to be bringing up upenn \u2014 the answer is always berkeley/stanford/mit &amp; sort of harvard. Idk these penn kids just need to fuck off they r being so naive \u2014 berkeley\u2019s vc/ startup network &amp; heritage run so much deeper.\n\nThat said, here\u2019s what you genuinely need to think about at the end of the day, because the truth is you can build anywhere and good products will get funded.\n\nWhat kind of person are you. Are you super technically minded / gifted, do you want to be the guy who is building the tech stack and basically an engineering weapon? Like is the hard skillset there ur priority? If so, berkeley EECS is where you should be headed.\n\nOn the contrary, if you fuck with engineering and want to have that skillset but you arent \u201cthat\u201d like go to technical guy\u2026 if you want to be like a ceo that knows whats going on in the stack but has a more dedicated cto type co founder breaking ground on that side\u2026 like generally if you expect to be leveraging your soft skills more/maybe maybe some more flexibility to pursue a variety of other career paths, then penn m&amp;t makes a ton of sense. There is no comparison when it comes to the ease of getting mbb consulting/IB/PE other top private sectore roles between penn &amp; berkeley. Less spots and way more competition @ berkeley.\n\nPersonally, I would probably take m&amp;t because i\u2019m more of a generalist/ops guy. But if you want to get super deep into engineering, berkeley will take you there and also give u a ton of respect when u get to fundraising.\n\nThe reality is you will be totally fine at either of these places. It is going to completely come down to what you as an individual are capable of. Neither of these places are going to hand you some billion dollar idea, or otherwise make entrepreneurship some easy path. You need to come to the table with the heat. You need to build your own network. And you need to hone your skillset.\n\nSo it really doesnt matter tbh. Just all these penn kids suggesting that penn is more plugged into the startup/vc world than berkeley, or otherwise the real kings \u2014 being HSM, is a joke dude. \n\nTldr, pure tech / u know u want to found \u2014 berkeley. Flexibility to pursue a lot and have broad prestige \u2014 penn.",

In fact, both the faculty director of Berkeley M.E.T and head of Berkeley's main accelerator are former Penn professors or Penn alum founders lol. I follow Saikat Chaudhuri on Linkedin so I know that much. Berkeley literaly has needed inspiration from Penn (and Stanford) to help build their programs.",

Berkeley has an acceleator too and some funding opportunities, but they are going to be extremely difficult to acquire due to sheer population of school. Penn even funds recent alumni founders through our Venture lab and sets recent alumni up in SF (Wharton has an SF campus believe it or not).",

I've met the Wealthfront founder (Andy, former Penn undergrad) when he came to visit and we had intimate conversations. I've also quite literally seen the Venmo founders in NYC at a Penn alumni event (but didn't speak with them unfortunately). Its very easy for Penn folks to help fellow Penn folks. It starts at the college level in classes and alumni events, and goes all the way up to asking partners at KP like Ted Schlein (former Penn undergrad) for guidance on funding. Ted literally visits an engineering entrepreneurship class every year to give advice on startups. AND thats the thing, Penn literally produces founders across all its schools. We have Physics majors like Michael J. Biercuk starting the world's top quantum computing company and Elon Musk obviously, to former Bio/Chem majors starting Life science/Therapeutics startups (there's too many to note lol). Without Penn alum, there literally wouldn't be everything from electric cars (Tesla) to simple p2p payments (Venmo)\n\nI do 100% agree than MIT/Stanford/Harvard have more resources and probably easier time than Penn, but we are comparable to those 3 institutions and Berkeley is a distant fifth or sixth.

Like its still one of the best and will serve you well. But when it comes to being in a culture of engineers/tinkerers, you will just find way more company at berkeley where those things r the dominant overtone on campus. It\u2019s gonna be way easier to find yourself in convos about complex AI/ML topics or you know whatever the fuck at berkeley vs penn. EECS is THE thing at berkeley, and the kids there are some of the most talented in the world (its like a 2% acceptance rate now lol no?). Penn engineering is good but its just a part of penn, not the focus or source of the school\u2019s culture in such a dominant way. K im off my soap box now i got locked in there for a sec. Stay strapped bro",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm trying to throw a Pokemon Showdown tournament in the fall, and hopefully if it goes well, another tournament later in the semester. I don't know what format to do for the tournament yet, but I was hoping to gauge possible ideas/gain and idea of how many people would like to participate. Here's a google form, I would really appreciate it if you could respond, apologies if its long (should only be 3 required questions).\n\nThe form is mainly to gain a sense of possible competitors, ideas for a reward at the end of the tournament, or anything else. \n\n[https://forms.gle/5eModz7Xw2Q8VWcx7](https://forms.gle/5eModz7Xw2Q8VWcx7)",

But the highs are memories that can, and will, last you a lifetime. I can\u2019t tell you how many times over the past four years I\u2019ve said to my friends, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell my kids about this.\u201d On top of that, I\u2019ve met some incredible people, learned more than I could have imagined about the world and about myself, and truly feel ready and prepared by this school to take on the world. There is something for everyone, and there is something for every part of myself. I have my academic crowd, my creative crowd, and my \u2018party\u2019 crowd, but what\u2019s amazing is that all of them mesh perfectly \u2014 most even overlap \u2014 United by our shared experience. \n\nPlus, while all of this was happening, the name on my degree was doing most of the legwork for me professionally to secure an awesome job\ud83d\ude05\n\nThat\u2019s what penn is to me. It\u2019s something worth retelling and reliving, so get ready to cherish every moment and take every road bump in stride\ud83e\udd72\n\nCongratulations, I hope you come to realize how lucky you are!",

I\u2019m not gonna blame people for their lack of socialization because I know how busy they are.

For undergrad Penn is super great, and you are very fortunate to have an opportunity that opens doorways the rest of your life. I would give anything to go back to college, esp. to the econ major in CAS. (I was a dual degree in Wharton and CAS but not affiliated with a program like Huntsman.) I became friendly with many of my econ profs, did an honors thesis in econ, and even became friendly with the nice staff. (Full disclosure: I went on to get my PhD in econ.) Agree with most other sentiment--not sure what the student who hates the admin hates about them. I never had an issue with admin other than Penn, like the Ivies in general, is bloated with staff/admin. There are too many of them tbh, but they are trying to make the Penn experience a good one and even though I've been out of Penn for years now, it was a simply amazing experience and truly made me into the person I am today! Have a blast, and congrats! You made it...",

I have known many professors who don't give a shit about students and just ramble on for the sake of rambling. I've only been here for one year, so I guess I got the best of the lot.\n\nI feel teachers getting bad reviews should not be allowed to use slides, just the board and chalk/marker. It is easier to catch them when that's the case, also they look stupid when they try to skip stuff.\n\nI've had only one professor using the board and chalk piece and he was the best of the lot in terms of teaching. He encourages students to ask questions and he literally goes above and beyond to get students not to feel shy.",

I've had organizations/working groups/individuals in the Philly area just give me a shot because of the Penn name alone. It's almost frightening how much you get to experience + do as an undergrad. Definitely made me much more prepared going into the real world.\n\nSocially, as others have said, you often become really tight with your friends from student orgs/select classes (since you spend so much time with them!).

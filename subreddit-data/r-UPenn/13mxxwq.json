    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman and am a little confused about the math requirements at Wharton. Obviously, it's too early to finalize my concentrations, but I am currently interested in Finance and Business Analytics.\n\nI've heard that there are many options to take during your Freshman Fall Semester: MATH 1070, 1100, 1300, 1400, and 1700.\n\n* 1070: I honestly have no clue what this is and the Penn website isn't the most helpful.\n* 1100: Formerly \"Calculus for Wharton Students,\" which apparently isn't even available anymore.\n* 1300: Super easy class, but doesn't seem like it satisfies many prerequisites (?)\n* 1400: Apparently super difficult, but required for STEM-based concentrations at Wharton (?)\n* 1700: Easier than 1400, but satisfies the math requirement at Wharton if you're not looking to concentrate in a STEM-focused field\n\nFrankly speaking, I'm not looking to overexert myself or do what is more than required when it comes to courses and put my GPA at risk. Can someone please advise me on what is true and what I should do? Should I take the placement tests during NSO? Thanks in advance!\n\n(NOTE: I don't have the ability to use AP Calculus BC or IB Math for credit)",

I'll study for the placement test and will take that whenever that ends up happening.\n\nIf I do well enough on the placement exam, am I exempt from that credit or am I supposed to take another calc class? Sorry, this is all just very new and confusing.",

    "postText": "If anyone's taken STAT970 before, could they attest to the appropriate background and their experiences taking the course? Thing I'm specifically curious about are:\n\nHow much will you struggle if you've only taken undergraduate real analysis (MATH360-361), as opposed to the master's level (MATH508-509) at Penn? Is there material exclusive to the master's level courses  that are helpful prerequisites? Or is it more just 'mathematical maturity'? If the latter, could you give examples of where significant mathematical maturity is useful in the class (eg. topic x requires familiarity with technique/idea y)?\n\nIs STAT930 (Probability Theory) a strict requirement? What about other rigorous graduate classes like ESE530? MATh546? How much of an issue is it to take the Probability class at the same time?\n\nHow much time/work does the class take up?\n\nFinally, in the larger scope of things (eg. as a researcher), how do you feel the topics you learned in this class end up being helpful to you? Would you recommend this class to someone interested in developing new statistical methods in practice?\n\nSorry for asking so many questions, but there's not much information on this available outside of the syllabus! Thanks in advance!",

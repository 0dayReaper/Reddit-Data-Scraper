    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm going to start medical school at UPenn in the fall. I was wondering what are the best areas to search for apartments based on my criteria:\n\n1. Safe. Obviously, one should always be cautious in a big city. But could I take walks there or go out after dark?\n\n2. Located near public transportation. Especially transport that would take me to campus. Please note, I don't necessarily mind a bit of a longer commute as criteria #1 is more important than #2.\n\n3. Located close to nature would be nice. Going to parks and getting fresh air will be essential for my mental health.\n\n4. Convenient access to stores and supermarkets. I plan to cook a lot of my own food to save money.\nI'm not really big on night life, so restaurants and bars aren't a concern.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you all can offer!",

The other 20% gets scattered in West Philly/UCity/Rittenhouse/Fairmount area. Fitler may be the first place to search because it\u2019s closer to the Schuylkill river park and considered \u201csafer\u201d.",

Try to avoid living on market st if you have options - gets a bit desolate after dark compared to chestnut-locust because it is a commercial/office corridor with primarily office buildings. \n\nFairmount is safe, as is grad hospital and parts of west Philly, but much less foot traffic at night. \n\nTry to avoid having the MFL be your only mode of transit\u2026 lots of drug users on the train. Used syringes and people nodding off while high are a common sight. I stepped on and almost had a used syringe go through my foot once. It runs through Kensington, which is the epicenter of the opioid epidemic in Philly. \n\nBuses are safe. Sometimes you can be waiting for the Penn shuttle/bus for a long time, but that\u2019s also an option. \n\nRittenhouse and parts of wash square west and filter square are highly trafficked and you would feel comfortable walking at night alone up to 9-10 pm or so alone. \n\nSomeone got mugged (no gun used) on the walnut st bridge recently before 9 pm and occasionally people get mugged on campus, so be aware after dark. It\u2019s very rare, but it does happen. I think the relative wealth of Penn students makes them a target. \n\nIt is probably not the best idea to be wandering around alone and drunk at 2 AM while wearing a Patek Philippe/Rolex in many parts of Philly due to the low density compared to NYC and other cities after dark, but the more foot trafficked areas are safer. When in doubt, Uber. \n\nhttps://spotcrime.com/crime/206886253-9242b4d78e36762a2468b875e9ca3d15\n\nThis website and Niche let you compare relative crime in each neighborhood.",

However, do not live on market street. \n\n2. You can take the trolleys to campus. They run every 10 minutes or so. Depending on your tolerance for exercise, you could also walk to campus from Spruce Hill if you felt like it.\n\n3. Clark park is right in the middle of Spruce Hill. There is also a lot of nature on campus, including the Schuylkill River Trail which is at the east end of campus. \n\n4. There is an Acme on 40th and Walnut, but I prefer Trader Joe\u2019s, which is on 22nd and MArket. The trolleys stop exactly at the trader joes on the way to Spruce Hill, which I found to be convienient, especially if you typically get 1-2 bags of groceries at a time.",

There is a mini market next to the building that sells everything you\u2019ll need to cook. Safe neighbourhood and there is a beautiful park nearby. It\u2019s at 4605 Chester ave, which is an approximately 25 min walk from campus and has the trolly literally right outside which will take you to campus in 10 mins. The rent is 945$ and you can get the first month free. Lmk if you\u2019d be interested?",

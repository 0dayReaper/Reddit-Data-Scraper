            "comment": "I took BIOL 205 (basically BIOL 2010 but a bit more in-depth) with them and Orgo 1 with Percec in the Fall of 2021. They're definitely a hard combo of classes to take together and you need a very good background in bio and gen chem if you want to succeed in the courses. If you're planning to study both at the same time, it definitely requires good time management since the course content for both courses can be very challenging. Whether it's memorizing biological mechanisms such as GPCR vs. RTK cell-signaling pathways or learning about the basics of Sn1 vs. Sn2 reactions, you need to be on top of the content. Definitely try to go to the professor's office hours whenever you can since the TAs for those courses weren't as helpful as I had hoped.\n\nRegarding Svitkina and Guo, I preferred Guo's lecturing style to Svitkina's since he often asked students questions and demonstrated the concepts in decent detail to students.",

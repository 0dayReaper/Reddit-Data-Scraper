    "postText": "Just unbelievable reporting by the New Yorker. I'm truly aghast at the actions of the University...specially the questioning by Provost, Beth Winkelstein.\n\n\"After asking about Mackenzie\u2019s time in foster care, Winkelstein moved on to her college essay. \u201cYou describe an experience,\u201d Winkelstein said. \u201cAnd ultimately you say it was your mother. If we review your medical records, is it going to show broken ribs and injuries to your facial area?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Mackenzie said.\n\n\u201cAnd you reported this to your school?\u201d\"\n\nI guess the University's point is that there was not enough damage done to Mackenzie. Not enough blood. Not enough neglect. That some picture of her riding a pony erases her story. But the cherry on top of the sundae.... the fact that all of this unraveled as she helped the case of the widow of a man who died, allegedly, because of the University's negligence. Yikes.\n\nI really hope this goes to a grand jury.\n\n[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/04/mackenzie-fierceton-rhodes-scholarship-university-of-pennsylvania](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/04/mackenzie-fierceton-rhodes-scholarship-university-of-pennsylvania)",

Most of it was UPenn and their biased narrative regurgitated by uninspired and un-investigative journalists.

UPenn and the media outlets they used to smear an abuse victim should pay enough in damages that this sort of thing never happens again. As far as I can tell the only problem they have with Mackenzie is that she hasn't been poor and abused long enough and that she has witnessed in a wrongful lawsuit against themThey are monsters.",

In my (former) capacities as both a student and staff member, I speak from direct experience. My \u2018journey\u2019 involved UPenn\u2019s President\u2019s office, Penn\u2019s internal \u201creview\u201d process, HR, Penn\u2019s internal counsel as well as Philadelphia court civil litigation.  Penn is a major employer and pours money into civic projects; this gives Penn a lot of leverage in a small city like Philadelphia. Penn also has nearly unlimited financial and political resources which they will freely use to completely squish anyone who steps out of line. For Mackenzie to succeed, she will need an advocate that is more powerful than UPenn and that will stay by her side during a long and ugly process.",

Not that they haven't been entangled in many controversies at this point, but just how they conducted themselves, especially Beth Winkelstein and Wendy White, is outrageous. It's like they went out of their way to throw a student under the bus to save PR face/the billion dollars endowment of name... only to create an even bigger scandal for themselves (which is the lesser issue here, but the common sense/principals of morality and decency is majorly lacking).",

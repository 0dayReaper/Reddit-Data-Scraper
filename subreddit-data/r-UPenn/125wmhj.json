    "postText": "I recently got accepted into a master's program at Penn and they offered me a partial scholarship with my admission ($10k/year). I know funding can often be negotiated at many schools -- does anyone have experience/success with this at Penn? It's one of my top choices but the tuition cost is likely prohibitive considering the salary I'll likely get in the the field I'm going to school for. \n\nI'm also planning on pursuing TA/RA jobs to help cover costs no matter where I end up going, but it seems like they are paid hourly at Penn and don't directly provide tuition remission like a lot of other schools, so there would still be substantial costs for tuition even with a TA job and my scholarship. Would love to know your experiences negotiating for more funding -- thanks!",

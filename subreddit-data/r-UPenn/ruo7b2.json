Where\u2019s the white supremacy in Indians joining the US upper class, having the highest income, and deciding to push racially divisive virtue signaling, unsupported by facts and clearly contradicted by their own personal experience, and then being cheered for it by all the US elites and institutions.  Where\u2019s the white supremacy come in? It\u2019s just more trashing of the working class by US elites of all races.  Spreading racial hatred doesn\u2019t lead to good things.  Replicating the caste society of India is at odds with American values.  Plenty of immigrants see through the upper class immigrant virtue signaling and hate it.  It\u2019s why Democrats are starting to see the immigrant vote defect.\n\n****\nThis post got me BANNED by the Penn-commies\u2026 \n\nUpper class immigrants coming to the US from a caste society and claiming they\u2019re facing racism while smoothly joining the top 10% of the US class structure and spreading false narratives about discrimination while the elites clap and cheer for them  \u2026 are spreading racism, and promoting racialization of politics.  They\u2019re not victims by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nHa ha ha Obama was discriminated against? Or rather, did every institution bend over backwards to elevate a mediocre guy with a weak track record?  There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s never released his transcripts from any school.  He\u2019s the President who destroyed US ability to deter.  Let Syria commit genocide.  Let Russia invade Ukraine and refused Ukraine weapons.

I\u2019m not against the discussion and think Penn could definitely improve in hiring POC but to make it seem like it\u2019s in the hands of lower level faculty is disingenuous. Wonder if Professor Wax was forced to participate in these monthly book clubs? Doesn\u2019t sound like it.",

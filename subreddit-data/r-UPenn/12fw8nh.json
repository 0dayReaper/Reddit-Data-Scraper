I would love to jam with them, if I find any. ;-;  \n\n\nPS: Also, so many cool Prog bands perform here. I saw Riverside and Porcupine Tree live here which was super fun. I am planning to go see Haken. Hmu if anyone else is going. ",

I\u2019m making my way through Radiohead right now, recently listened to Kid A and loved it. You have any good recs?",

Stranger Heads Prevail and Terraformer are my favorite albums of theirs. Then there're other bands that are arguably prog-like such as Snarky Puppy (who are btw performing tomorrow in Philly), Mark Lettieri, Corey Wong, House of Waters, etc. \n\nThen there's Prog/Djent stuff which has a lot of promising artists such as Plini, Polyphia, Intervals,etc. With vocals - Periphery, Tesseract \n\nI also listen to a lot of Indian Classical Prog Fusion. Loafs of cool bands such as Advaita, Mrigya etc. \n\nThen there's the prog rock in the conventional sense. I like Karnivool, Haken (coming to Philly on May 10), Porcupine Tree (My favorite - has a lot of similarities to Radiohead), Opeth, DT, Mastodon, Riverside, Rishloo (similar to Tool), the Mayan Factor, Caligula's Horse, etc. \n\nSorry I might have included a lot of popular/mainstream ones but you might find something new here. Let me know which ones you love as well. :)",

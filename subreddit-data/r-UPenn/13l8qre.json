No culture of grade deflation and students aren\u2019t competitive with each other (maybe internships but not in class), there is a shitty club culture here but certain clubs are open recruitment so I had extracurriculars without serious applications. Students are\u2026 rich? But they aren\u2019t mean, just can be daunting sometimes if you come from a middle to lower income background like myself. Resources and professors are incredible though.",

I didn't think it would gay so much within schools. I did CMPE (so mostly CIS classes with some ESE) and I did not find it to be deflated, most classs were curved to somewhere in the B to A- range. Especially upper-level CIS classes, for a lot of those over a third (or even over half) of the class was getting A/A+",

Like if someone earns a 97 in a class and ends up with an A-/B+ instead of an A/A+? Lack of inflation does not mean deflation and curving classes up at all by definition would be inflation, not deflation. Penn just doesn't curve the class average up to an A like some other Ivies do (though even here curving to a B+/A- seems pretty common)",

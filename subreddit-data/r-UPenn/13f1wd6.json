    "postText": "Incoming freshman here :)\n\nI was looking at potential majors and currently, my two top choices are either PSCI or IR. However, I saw on the PSCI website that there's a \"track\" in IR, so I was wondering if there was a significant difference between the two. So far, it seems as though IR is a little bit broader given that you have to take PSCI, history, and econ courses (and I think I would prefer the freedom to explore different subjects), but I also saw somewhere that IR is just a minor to PSCI, so is one department \"better\" than the other? Thanks!",

            "comment": "To answer your question, you\u2019re right that the IR major is more interdisciplinary than PSCI.\n\nWith PSCI, you have a choice of taking a concentration within the major. Last I remember, there are four - political theory, IR, American politics, and comparative politics. You can do this by taking a certain amount of CUs within the major that qualify. You can concentrate if you\u2019d like but it is not necessary to graduate.\n\nThe IR major will allow you to focus on the topic almost exclusively. With the PSCI concentration, you\u2019ll have to take other unrelated PSCI classes in order to fulfill major requirements. You should just pick whichever one interests you more, because when it comes to career or grad school, either major will open you up to more or less the same opportunities.",

But I think the main reason you\u2019re seeing all those PSCI professors is because IR isn\u2019t really considered a core academic discipline in the way political science or economics would be. Rather it is supposed to be an interdisciplinary area of focus. There are a few other majors like this, and in these cases, your requirements would mostly just be a combination of relevant courses from other departments. Hopefully I\u2019m making sense \ud83d\ude05",

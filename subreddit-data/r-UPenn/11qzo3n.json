    "postText": "So I'm an Aussie and I have always dreamt of studying in the US. I'm kinda questioning whether it would be worth doing a degree of computer science with someone who has no experience in computer science. \n\nI did my bachelors in finance and want to transition to tech. I'm planning of doing master in Aus if the US doesn't accept me, but just wondering is the program worth it for an international/aussie student whether that be in job opportunities or competitive standing in America and Australia if I want to go back to Australia.\n\nAlso how is the social uni/college life in Upenn and is the same for both masters and bachelors program. Such as joining clubs, making friends in dorms etc. Would love to know everyone's experience or things they have heard from people?",

            "comment": "Like the other comment said, the MCIT program ([Master of Computer and Information Technology](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/master-of-computer-and-information-technology/)) is designed for people who don't have prior experience in computer science. I don't think you would be able to complete the regular computer science masters ([CIS MSE](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/mse-in-cis/)) without prior experience.\n\nThe MCIT program is 10 courses, and for an additional 6 courses you can also get a CIS MSE as well.",

Only if the medical fraternity stop making claims that aren't true just for propaganda will the public have trust in them, otherwise, they will trust literally any other source including random conspiracy theories.\n\nNow imagine we actually have a vaccine that is very safe and really stops the spread of a disease and all we need is for everybody to take it, nobody would step forward and countless will die unnecessarily.\n\nThese days, people are questioning if the prominent politicians actually got the vaccine or if they are just placebos. So much distrust everywhere.\n\nThe only way to earn trust back is to atleast develop algorithms which politicians have to take part in to ensure they actually got the vaccine shots.",

Will it be hard being so much older than other freshman or will people not care? Do many people make friends with students in other years or in Penn\u2019s grad schools? Is this super atypical or will there be other older undergrads?",

I believe that students 22 or older can opt to waive the on campus housing requirement, but it might also let you make more friends even if they're quite a bit younger (read more [here)](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/two-year-housing-dining-requirement/)",

Incomings are likely 17 years old and that's a pretty big gap in terms of mental age as well. There are plenty of other ways you can make friends though without feeling weird - join Castle, club volleyball or any other clubs. You don't need to limit your friend pool to Penn either - Philly is huge.",

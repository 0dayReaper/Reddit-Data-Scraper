    "postText": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any sample sophomore year pre-med schedules and how it was for them? I think Im kinda behind classes wise and requirement wise as I am a current freshmen but haven't taken bio or my chem labs. I also don't know which major I want to do just yet. Any advice or guidance is super helpful! Thank you!",

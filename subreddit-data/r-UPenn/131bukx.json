    "postText": "Hey guys so I recently got the Gates Scholarship and I am currently filling out the acceptance form. However, as I was reading it, I came across the waiver section and the stuff I have to sign if I choose to participate in the Summer Institute event. This year I saw we are going to Florida. The details of the waiver section sound very cautious especially where they highlight on releasing the program from any liability if something bad happens to you. Like you can\u2019t blame them if you get injured, died etc. I read it with my parents and they also found the details fishy. So they asked me to research more about it before choosing to participate in the summer Institute (since it is optional). I was wondering if any Penn Gates Scholars on here are familiar with the schedule we\u2019ll have there/the activities Gates does, or how careful they are during the summer Institute?",

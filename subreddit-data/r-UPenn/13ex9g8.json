I\u2019m trying to set up an automatic forwarding to my personal email but I haven\u2019t been able to do so using the instructions on gmail. Has anyone been able to do this successfully? Also, do we get an alumni email at some point? Would this allow me to view the emails I\u2019m getting to my current Penn email? \n\n \nAlso, does anyone know when exactly we\u2019ll lose access to the accounts?",

I wanted to know how the two compare, and who teaches the freshman seminar, CHEM 022? Also how many people major in CS in this program, and how do premed requirements work with waivers?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot",

Pursue the minor if you have an interest or go for computational concentration of the Biology major which includes all of the foundational cis courses without requiring many additional electives",

    "postText": "Sorry if I'm bad at reading and this genre of question isn't allowed, but I'm a prospective student who applied for the MA Art History program. The application deadline was three and a half months ago and I haven't heard anything back yet. My application status still just says \"submitted.\" The internet reveals no information on when decisions are usually released, but I know most universities want to hear back from you about committing sometime in April or early May at the latest.  I'm starting to think I've essentially been rejected through ghosting, which feels incredibly unprofessional. Anybody been here before and have any insight?",

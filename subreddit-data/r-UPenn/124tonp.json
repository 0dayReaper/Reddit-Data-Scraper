    "postText": "Hi! I was thinking about pursuing grad school after finishing up my undergraduate degree at Penn, so I wanted to start thinking about potential ways I could get recommendation letters from professors.  \nUp until this point, all my classes for my major are huge lecture classes (and will continue to be in this way because my program is pretty big). So, I haven't gotten to know any of my existing/past professors well enough for them to write a letter for me.\n\nIt is crucial that I get at least 1 recommendation from an academic source (ie. a professor) in this upcoming Fall semester, do you have any recommendations on how I can do so?\n\n(Enrolling in small seminar-style classes is not really an option for me at this moment)",

I find the easiest way was taking small seminars multiple times with the same prof \u2014 repeated exposure over several years. You say this isn\u2019t an option for you, so I would prompt you to evaluate whether that\u2019s truly the case or if you could swap in a seminar this semester and punt one of the other classes to a later time. Or even take an higher course load so you can take a seminar. \n\nOffice hours can help as a starting point, but you\u2019re not going to get great fodder for a letter by that alone. As the other commenter pointed out, another route is becoming a research assistant.",

I\u2019m in the same boat, the reality my friend is that you just have to make the time during officer hours one day to ask or shoot them an email. Look for the \u201cchill\u201c professors in your subject area. Tell them how you\u2019re in a bit of a bind as it pertains to finding a recommender and ask them if they could write one up and say it doesn\u2019t have to be specific. If you have the the time maybe even make a template and send it to them in the email to make their life easier. Most professors are just low on time but if you\u2019re willing to do the majority of the work they\u2019re more than willing to sign off on it. Depending on what kind of grad school you\u2019re applying too most of the time the rec letters are overrated. As long as they\u2019re not negative it\u2019s hard to quantify an inherently subjective thing. This does depend again on what kind of grad school you\u2019re applying to. If you\u2019re applying for a Phd in clinical neuroscience, eyebrows will be raised on why you have no research experience and a non personalized rec letter. If you\u2019re applying for a masters it\u2019s a lot different.",

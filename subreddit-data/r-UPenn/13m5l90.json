    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising fgli junior who will be off the dining plan next year. I applied for snap benefits since I am given work study from penn and thought I was eligible. However, I received a notice that they rejected my request. Does anyone know how to appeal? I don\u2019t work for the work study anymore but I did freshman year. Would that count for anything? \n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

I have some experience with them since I am from Philly.\n\nEdit: Ik you said you get work study but that you don\u2019t work for it anymore so I was just curious if you were employed or not",

And I'm sorry that happened to you.\n:( I'm also from Philly, and as you also likely know, the system is *significantly* less than perfect at times. Mistakes definitely happen, but my org really tries to advocate for these cases. It's angering. Thankfully, it doesn't always happen, but it really sucks when it does.",

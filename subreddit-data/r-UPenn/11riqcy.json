    "postText": "Hey, I'm a freshman taking a class in session I and another class in session II this summer.  Was thinking about staying with family and commuting, but want to explore opportunities for on-campus housing. \n\nIf I know someone who is doing on-campus research and got a housing stipend would I be allowed to live with them?  Not sure how housing stipends through research opportunities work, would they be able to select a 2 bedroom accommodation?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other suggestions?",

On campus housing is soooo expensive and like the other comment said, its you can get some good deals for off campus where you'll have more freedom and likely better accommodations (bigger rooms, kitchen, living space, etc)",

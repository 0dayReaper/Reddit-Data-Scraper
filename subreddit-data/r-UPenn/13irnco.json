The real competition happens via extracurriculars. Everyone vies for a chance to join the best labs and shadow the best doctors and it can sometimes feel like you\u2019re behind. But there\u2019s more than enough opportunities to go around so just try to stay diligent and keep your eye out.",

Penn believes in you -- so have some faith in yourself! !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Don't let fears of competition scare you (nobody has ever gone out of their way to screw me academically). Social life is what you make of it -- some folks stay in VP all day while others join PhiDE. Penn is your oyster.!&lt;",

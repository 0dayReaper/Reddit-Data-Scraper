    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m an incoming freshman so I\u2019d love to hear some opinions from people who are already going through this. I know your major doesn\u2019t matter for premed, but what are some majors that hit a decent number of prerequisites that can also get you a job making good money (like around 80k+ usd) with a bachelor\u2019s in case I decide down the road that becoming a doctor isn\u2019t for me? Right now, I\u2019m thinking of double majoring in English and neuroscience (maybe neurobiology or cognitive science instead). Please let me know what you think and thank you!",

            "comment": "Because its Penn, I've seen both English and Bio/Neuroscience majors get consulting type jobs after college which typically pay base 100k USD. In fact, I've seen Communications majors break into consulting from Penn too. Its definitely much harder for Humanities and Life science majors to break into this compared to Wharton and Engineering/Quantitative majors but still very doable.",

    "postText": "Particularly medicine, dental, nursing, and maybe the social work school if yall feel this is applicable: how does your clinical training work? \n\nA common complaint in the vet school is we don't get a lot of training prior to clinical year in the \"doing things\" part of medicine (eg. placing catheters, POCUS, blood draw, injections, etc etc). Understandably this is hard to train ppl on because there are risks if you fuck it up or requires some degree of skill and so having a student doing it takes 4x the time. \n\nRight now our clinical training (edit: part of, there's other classes and labs for practice tbc) is a kind of sad sign off sheet we have to complete in our 2nd year that mostly amounts to us talking through common procedures with 4th year students during clinical rotation shadowing. I have a lot of thoughts on it but suffice to say I don't think this is a great way to train future clinicians. Which leads me to wonder, since I imagine there are a lot more limitations to practicing on humans vs. animals, how do yall get your clinical skills? Do you feel like it's working well? Or is this more of a veterinary problem since many of yall will do post grad training and vets are not required to?",

            "comment": "I realize I'm not the audience you're targeting with this post but as a graduate of Penn vet I can tell you that the \"clinical training\" you get through school in the basic skills you described is abysmal. A major downfall of the school's program, in my opinion, is their huge inability to provide sufficient hands-on practice in these clinical skills. And this doesn't only apply to blood draws; they fail to give students any real surgical experience as part of their curriculum as well. Penn vet essentially makes it the responsibility of the student to seek out extracurricular opportunities (summer jobs, shelter volunteering, the Thailand trip, externships, etc) in order to gain these skills. Offering a few labs, the opportunity to do one (heavily guided) spay surgery, and maybe the chance to assist with some hands on things in your clinical year is not enough. It somewhat makes sense considering their intense focus on academia; ask almost any (non-ER) vet professor to do a blood draw or place a catheter and there's a 90% chance they can't, because that's not what their day-to-day job entails. Penn prepares you to deal with complicated cases, to try to change the world, but it doesn't teach you how to be an everyday doctor. I highly recommend doing an internship after graduation to work on those skills.",

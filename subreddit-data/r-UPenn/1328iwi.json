I have listened to several of her lectures, and she is highly skilled!\n\nShe has said some inappropriate, hurtful, and outright wrong things - to be sure.  However, she has a degree from Yale in biophysics, a medical degree from Harvard, a board certification in neurology from Cornell, a law degree from Columbia, and has argued over a dozen cases before the US Supreme Court.  I can learn a lot from someone with that kind of experience, and I can respect what she has accomplished, without zero risk of being indoctrinated into her old-school attitudes of white supremacy.  Only an idiot would even wonder whether her opinions represent the values of the University.\n\nTenure does not provide \"total freedom\" as suggested by some.  In my time at Penn, I have seen tenured faculty rapidly dismissed for mere suspicion that they falsified some data, for [entirely consensual] sex with a student &gt; 21 yrs old, for sexual contact with a minor in another country, and for sharing an illicit drug with a student in their office.   Are we so afraid of mere words from a 70 yrs old woman who grew up under very different standards that we are going to punish her in the same way as those offenders?  You didn't choose Penn because it offered you purity of thought, did you?\n\nI suggest that we all avoid the [\"Streisand Effect\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect), learn what she can teach that is of value, and ignore the things she says that were normative at one time, but have now become distasteful.  Let her be, and don't give MAGAs an example of cancel culture to champion against.  \n\nAlso keep in mind that tenure works both ways: without tenure, progressive faculty in Florida are at risk of their jobs because of conservative politicians and judges gone off-the-rails.",

I've never been to her lectures, but how highly skilled does this argumentation sound?\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just that Democrats love open borders, and Asians want more Asians here,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPerhaps they (and especially their distaff element) are just mesmerized by the feel-good cult of \u2018diversity.\u2019 I don\u2019t know the answer. **But as long as most Asians support Democrats and help to advance their positions, I think the United States is better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration**.\u201d\n\nYou see that argumentation?

That's wine-drunk, Jeanine Pirro levels of spurious bigotry, maybe the most laughably ridiculous and STUPIDEST thing I've heard someone with a law degree say, including \"release the kraken.\" \n\nThat is not just horribly offensive. I wouldn't even call it \"intellectually dishonest.\" That would imply she even thought about what she said before saying it. It is just knee jerk, freewheeling racism from an extraordinarily bigoted person. If she allows that to poison her reasoning, how can you ever respect her output as an academic? She's a fucking idiot, and so are you for even deigning to appeal to whatever credentials she has.",

Many call various religions dangerous for being racist, misogynistic, warmongering, or whatever.   I personally believe that anyone who promotes gun ownership is dangerous.  Is the solution to revoke the tenure and fire anyone who speaks out in favor of a religion we don't like, or in favor of owning assault rifles?  I just don't think that conformity to thoughts &amp; beliefs that you deem to be 'not dangerous' as a condition for continued employment is wise, or even viable.  We must focus on fighting bad ideas with better ideas, not fighting bad ideas by cancelling whole people.\n\n&gt; Letting her stay just because she has a degree from some prestigious school is exactly the line of reasoning of the average retarded american; it\u2019s like glorifying the unabomber just because he went to Harvard. Stop falsely appealing to her authority.\n\nNo, the degree on the wall doesn't impress me, but the long string of accomplishments do.  I'm not falsely appealing to her authority because it's an undeniable fact that she knows a helluva lot more about neurology, law, and the supreme court than 99+% of people.  Hate her or not, she is an authority on these subjects, with credentials conferred by other authorities on those subjects.  Suggesting that the unabomber might be better than me at math because he taught that subject at Harvard is hardly glorifying him, it may well be a fact.\n\nBTW: let's not use the word 'retarded' any more ... it's offensive, and I've only recently become an American.\n\n&gt; Relying on the Streisand effect for your argument makes me laugh. It\u2019s like saying \u201cignore every problem just because making light of it will make it worse.\u201d Are you saying that we should never bring to light the things that are wrong? How do we fix anything then?\n\n'Never bring to light'?  No, not at all.  Argue all you want, but argue about the ideas, not whether the person deserves a job at a university you had no role in building.  You take away her freedom to speak, even stupid stuff, and you take away everyone's freedom.  Also, if her tenure is revoked and she is fired for merely expressing ideas, she is likely to win a lawsuit.  I'd rather ignore her and thereby minimize her visibility, than give her and her views front page coverage throughout the country.\n\n&gt; And nobody said it had to be political, but you formed your argument in that way for obvious reasons. It\u2019s not political she\u2019s just wrong. Racism is wrong.\n\nI agree, although it's one of many things that are wrong, and I aim to improve things that are wrong, not make them worse.  Newton's political law saying that every action prompts an opposite action seems to apply in this kind of situation.  Attempting to cancel the **person** Amy Wax because you don't like the **ideas** of Amy Wax is exactly what energizes the MAGAts of today, and I believe they are truly dangerous.\n\n&gt; To top it off, there is very low demand for law professors because there are many many more qualified candidates than available positions, meaning that Wax is very replaceable.\n\nActually, not even close to true, but that's another subject.\n\n&gt; Just say that you\u2019re racist and go",

But there are times when \u201ccancelling\u201d somebody is the right choice, usually under 2 circumstances:\n\n1.\t\u2060No room for \u201cbetter ideas\u201d: Better ideas would be things like education, dialogue, and constructive criticism. Like you said earlier, Wax isn\u2019t going to change from \u201cher old-school ideas of white supremacy\u201d and she filed for grievance against penn law - meaning that she\u2019s not going to change no matter what we do. This means that removing her from her position forcefully or at the very least forcing a leave of absence (which is what penn decided to do) would be the best course of action to prevent further harm.\n2.\t\u2060Objective \u201cbad\u201d: People who automatically turn to cancelling a person whose ideas differ from their own are horrible and it\u2019s what cancel culture has come to. Things like abortion, for instance, is debatable, and there\u2019s no clear objective winner in this topic. Being racist towards students and promoting a white supremacist ideology, on the other hand, is an objective \u201cbad\u201d that you and I can both agree on. It\u2019s a clear \u201cdangerous\u201d that we can both agree on, since instilling racist ideology to our future lawyers can have large rippling effects on our nation.\n\nWhen you combine these two scenarios, an \u201cobjective bad\u201d and an unwillingness to change from this objective bad, cancelling is the best choice.\n\nYou argue that freedom of speech trumps all of her harms to society, but it\u2019s widely agreed upon throughout every court in the states that people in positions of power should have their freedom of speech restricted if it causes harm. For example, the president saying that all muslims should be banned would warrant the restriction of this speech, since the harms to society would be huge. In this scenario, it\u2019s clear that Wax should have her freedom of speech restricted instead of letting her spew racial slurs at her own students and promote racism for our future lawyers.\n\nYou missed my point about her credentials; I\u2019m not discrediting her accomplishments, but rather saying that it\u2019s important to look past them. For example, if the best neurosurgeon in the world has a history of rape, it would be wise to relieve him from his position as a doctor.",

Your 2 circumstances are not codified in the law or in university policies.  In contrast, rape is a criminal act, and conviction for any criminal act is well established grounds for termination at Penn. \n\nI don't agree with your statement about an objective \"bad\".  As repugnant as something might be, that is not what the term \"objective\" means.  Many, for example, would equate abortion to \"baby killing\", and assert that it is objectively bad.  Others genuinely don't, so there is nothing objective about that label.  If a cop has a device that accurately measured your speed at 47 in a 35 zone, speeding is objective label for that because it is not subject to personal beliefs or perceptions.\n\nI also don't agree that we are at much risk of instilling racist ideology into our future lawyers.  Law students are subject to countless influences and we can hardly expect any of them to adopt all the ideas of any one instructor.  I had a flagrantly outspoken communist for a science professor once upon a time, and many were up in arms about his potential corruption of us young'ins.  He was an excellent science professor, but had as much chance of making me communist as converting me to pastafarianism.",

            "comment": "I study english and polisci in undergrad. I came to Penn with an iPad from high school (it saved me for the IB diploma) but after two years in college I am using it less and less, now barely. My classes are content heavy, there\u2019s a lot of theory concepts and readings. For lectures, I prefer taking notes by laptop because it\u2019s much faster and you have a lot of freedom with copy pasting, finding things quicker, looking things up during the lecture, etc. I have adhd so I am more efficient / less distracted with a trackpad than with manual work/stylus work on the iPad during class. For the lecture classes where I used the iPad, I ended up being too much of a perfectionist with how my notes looked and it was hard to catch everything the prof was saying and write it down. There weren\u2019t any diagrams or visuals that were really necessary, and I didn\u2019t have to draw anything so my iPad essentially became obsolete. I don\u2019t annotate lecture slides, I take separate notes anyway. And even if I do have a lot of readings, I have found that taking reading notes from a blank page helps me learn much better than annotating directly on the page, so again I prefer the notes-reading split-screen on the laptop than highlighting on my readings. For classes where I need to learn by heart, I use quizlet and laptop is much easier to copy paste what I need directly. Most of my classes are essay heavy, and I prefer planning on paper. I reckon I will still use the iPad for requirements like physics ans environmental science, but you do not have to worry about that in graduate school. For calculations, problems, diagrams it\u2019s really helpful, but I think for humanities and some social sciences just a laptop and a small notepad is better and less heavy in the bag!",

Lots of people like to use an iPad to take notes on the actual lecture slides, but you could also do this by printing out the slides on paper.\n\nAn iPad is nice to have because it can make things more convenient, but there's a lot you have to buy with it (apple pencil, a cover, a screen protector, notes apps like GoodNotes). If you're fine using pen and paper, I'd stick with it -- you can always buy an iPad after you start your classes if you think you absolutely need it.",

I\u2019d say an iPad is not necessary but I found it incredibly helpful. You can have an infinite amount of different colors to color code and highlight your notes, add additional notes in a different color, your eyes find the right locations to read on the notes. You can also move text to different places so organization is also easier. Of course you can do these things with a laptop too, but then you can\u2019t really hand write equations or draw diagrams.\n\nI find it easier to read notes on my iPad than notes I take normally because of these options",

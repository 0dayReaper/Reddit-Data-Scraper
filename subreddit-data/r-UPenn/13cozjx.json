    "postText": "Hi! Sorry to be yet another incoming freshman asking housing questions, but I could use some advice. My number one priority is facility quality (I.e. no bugs/rodents). I know that Hill and Lauder are supposed to be nice and that the Quad is not great (when it comes to roaches and such) \u2014 How nice are Gregory and KCECH? \n\nAlso, do SEAS students in Gregory find the walk to classes really far (especially in winter)?",

I started the moot court team and we don't cut people because the club is generally work intensive and penn students are frankly averse to actual time commitment/ extremely flakey. Feel free to PM me if you want any help/ have any questions. I stepped back and didn't do anything for it senior year but I basically ran the thing for three years. (Can't help you with mock trial though - I did it in high school but not at Penn!)",

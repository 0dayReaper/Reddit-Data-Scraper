    "postText": "As stated above, I\u2019m a rising junior. I am also queer (bisexual). I was never able to come out at home, so when I came to penn and saw (what looked like) ample LGBT community, I was elated. I came out to campus towards the beginning of freshman year, and I was initially ecstatic at how it had went. I didn\u2019t encounter any homophobia or outright discrimination and all of my friends (who were and are predominantly straight) were nothing but accepting of me. But then I started to engage with the queer community itself, and the experience quickly soured. Note that when I refer to the queer community, I am speaking of both explicitly queer organizations (LGBT center affiliated clubs) and to a lesser extent, implicitly queer organizations (things predominantly made up of queer students like Elmo\u2019s, Excelano, etc. ). Despite an initial welcome, I was quickly in an odd place - they would recognize me as queer, but would want nothing to do with me. As with all things, I decided to put my best effort into fitting in and gave it more time, but two years has done nothing for me in this regard. I would assume that this rejection from the community is likely tied to the fact that I\u2019m not exactly the most queer presenting person there is appearance/fashion wise, and add that to my bisexuality, i get the vibe that they all see me as \u201cnot queer enough\u201d. Granted of course, these are generalizations. Not everyone in these organizations has actively ostracized me, but I would argue that there are serious flaws with the community\u2019s acceptance of its own. I highly doubt other affinity spaces on campus are this \u201cselective\u201d about who they accept (though please correct me if I\u2019m wrong). Quite frankly, it\u2019s been an incredibly souring experience for me and I didn\u2019t have any other places to express my frustration at not finding acceptance from those like me at penn. If anyone has dealt with similar issues, please let me know how you managed them.",

                            "comment": "It is absolutely invalidating and quite frankly, the exclusive and selective nature of these circles are toxic. I'm sorry you experienced this. I definitely understand. Penn is a somewhat socially isolating place, and it's not uncommon to not find your people (but also very possible) especially when everyone is doing 30+ things for career and academic advancement. Social capital is unfortunately a thing many people care about, and I also experienced a lot of surface level interactions or people appraising how knowing me might help them. And in full accountability, I was doing the same thing. That's why I wanted validation by the people who seemed cool to me. I was close friends with the Elmo class of my year and felt excluded despite that because I wasn't in Elmo. And when I quit my sorority and stopped being \"in the scene\" I became less \"relevant\" and saw who my real friends are. It's sucks to be judged, and if you were accepted into the circle, you'd probably still be judged. Finding self love and being into who you are is the start of not caring what people think. When I feel judged, I no longer seek to try to prove myself to people. Rather, I see the suffering that is occurring within these people and I feel bad for them. It's their loss at the end of the day to be so superficial to not be able to see the gem that you are. The people who have patience to get to know you will be lucky. I will also add that perhaps there's other reasons for a lack of resonance and connection. It sounds like you've tried to fit in rather than to show up as your most authentic self. Who would you be if you weren't trying to be the person you think these peeps would accept?",

I also had parallel experiences with the established queer groups at my own undergrad institution. Unless there are specific experiences that indicate biphobia or discomfort with you not being \u201cqueer enough\u201d, you could just be encountering the usual sort of catty \u201ccool kid\u201d social climbing behavior common at schools like Penn. The Queer Community\u2122\ufe0f is not a monolithic thing. Rather than try to enter social spaces where you feel unwelcome, you can create your own queer community with your own friends. Chances are there are others that may be in your position who would appreciate that.",

I personally respect someone having the confidence and means to have that expression, but many people come from backgrounds where this is not accepted at all, let alone normalized. I wish queer spaces were more tolerant of those who aren't \"outwardly\" queer, and recognized the privilege that comes with being able to express so openly at places like Penn and elsewhere.",

It seemed like there was a group of \u201cpopular kids\u201d who looked and acted the \u201cgayest\u201d out of anyone. I think many people are coming into their identity and trying to figure out how they want others to perceive them. I also found it exhausting to have to constantly be hyper aware of my speech in queer spaces, that one verbal misstep (not knowing a certain historical event, saying \u201ccrazy\u201d, etc) would lead to getting castigated. I agree with the other commenter that a lot of events were BYOs and parties at the gay frat and other stuff that\u2019s tedious and uncomfortable to me. \n\nI think as an adult (it\u2019s been 6 years since graduation for me), I don\u2019t feel as deeply attached to being \u201cqueer\u201d as I did at Penn. I have settled more into my identity, and while I do love being around queer people organically, I don\u2019t seek out queer spaces anymore.",

Not saying it doesn't happen, though.\n\nI had LGBT spaces I went to at Penn, but tbh yeah I did sometimes find it kinda alienating. Maybe for different reasons? A lot of queer community is centered around partying/nightlife (see the queer senior society for one example), which has never been my thing, and the LGBT center affiliated groups are super decentralized and often pretty hobbled by the restricted event funding.\n\nI know it's a cliche, but I actually made most of my queer friends through performing arts. If you're open to it, theatre tech crew is the easiest way in and a super welcoming community.",

The world has ALWAYS misunderstood or shamed its most intelligent and critical thinkers. Don't take their ostracization of you too personally. ;) But yes, thank you for speaking up since this conversation is so needed.",

I'm not a part of the community, but I'm an ally, and although this issue arises in more places than just Penn, what you're describing IS happening *at Penn*. So, by all means, it's more than valid for you to talk about it here. I wish you the best of luck, and I'm sorry you're having to deal with this.",

Campus organisations are unnecessarily selective, but communities exist beyond them even though it's oftentimes way too difficult to find them. Feel free to DM to vent or whatever, we're somewhat in the same boat haha",

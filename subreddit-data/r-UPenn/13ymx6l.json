    "postText": "im a rising sophomore and i come from an area where there is basically no public transport. for the past year, i've been ubering everywhere and now that i'm in philly for the summer, i'm hoping to start using septa instead (possibly getting a septa pass for the summer). does anyone have any info about septa as a penn student and if it would be more economical to just get the pass? i don't know if i would continue to use it during the school year though\n\nif someone could just pm and lead me thru how septa works and getting a card and knowing where to get off like im a kindergartener that would be appreciated haha",

            "comment": "Getting a card - If you plan on using septa I'd definitely recommend getting a key card. When you ride the bus or train, typically the fare is $2.50 if you pay cash. If you pay with the card, it's only $2. The card costs $4.95, but once you link the card to a septa account online, you get the $4.95 refunded as balance on the card that you can use to ride, so it's pretty worth it. Once you make an account, you can check your balance and reload it via your phone which is convenient. \n\nAs for getting a card, tbh I would just go to the market-frankford station on 34th or 40th, go underground and buy it from one of the kiosks there. \n\nAs for riding, download the Transit app and it'll tell you when buses are coming. You can find out which buses/routes to take using google/apple maps. When the bus comes, you hop on, scan your card (or pay cash), and then wait until you're close to your destination. Once you're approaching the corner where you're getting off you pull the cord and the driver will stop. You can get off wherever you want, but you can only get on buses at certain stops\n\nFor the train, they stop at every stop so you can get on / get off. There are also express trains that you have to be careful about because they don't stop at every stop but that's not too much of a concern\n\nFor penn students, I believe lucy buses are free if you have a penncard. Additionally, the pennrides app allows you to call rides around campus at night and stuff and it's free, so take advantage of that. That's all I know, lmk if u got questions lol",

I've never had the best luck with the kiosks tbh.\n\nCan confirm LUCY buses are free with PennCard, though the routes are really only convenient for Penn Med. But if you don't mind the detour, they do have AC, so on the hottest days of the summer it's quite nice.",

It only works out to be cheaper if you're riding more often than ~12 times per week (so commuting 6 days a week). Instead, you can just set your travel wallet to auto-reload and then it's just as easy as having a pass.",

There will be signs above the station entrances, and you can find the other direction by crossing the street.",

Yes. \n\nThe baseline for MCAT is gen chem, gen bio, o-chem, biochem, physics, and some basic math. +CARS section. \n\nGo over to r/MCAT if you're not already there. There's a lot of insights available there.",

You could also argue some basic anatomy and physiology, but I've managed without taking a course on that. But don't get too hung up on the details of each subject, it's not about the depth that's the issue, it's breadth. You don't have to necessarily memorize specific cell-signaling pathways or kinetics of actin polymerization but you need to leverage the principles of cell and molecular bio and understand the major features and functions of major cellular and genetic elements such as cytoskeletal elements or the central dogma (i.e., RNA --&gt; DNA --&gt; protein and how that is achieved).\n\nOn a similar note, you need to get familiar with some basic laboratory techniques such as blots (e.g., Western, Northern), gels like SDS-PAGE and gel electrophoresis, and many different flavors of chromatography. \n\n  \nBIOL 2010 is definitely not easy and you need to be on your A-game if you want a good grade in the course. BIOL 2210 is more manageable but still not a walk in the park.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, you still need to put in the effort yourself. But perhaps some of the magic bullets I provide in the guide will remove the shock factor and make one more equipped to tackle the course.\n\nEDIT: Important disclaimer as pointed out - I took CIS 1600 specifically in Spring 2023 with Val Tannen, so the advice for midterm 2 and the final are not accurate to how Rajiv teaches it in the Fall.",

Maybe I'll have open Q&amp;A for those struggling to understand material that the guide doesn't cover, since I could inform myself on the conceptual stuff ahead of time. Then, I make edits to the guide once I figure out how the course specifically wants you to use the material.",

Our graph theory stuff was completely different as Tannen covers some stuff rajiv covers in 121. Also Rajiv\u2019s exams aren\u2019t as direct and are more of coming up with a clever proof for something\u2014more like competition math.\n\nOff the top of my head Rajiv covers: Probabilistic method, Ramsey Theory, Matchings/Relations (Halls Theorem), Eulerian/Hamiltonian cycles etc \u2014 don\u2019t think Tannen covers these?",

Val should cover relations to a solid extent (he\u2019s a logic/databases guy and I would even argue it\u2019s more up his wheelhouse than Rajiv\u2019s). I would agree that Val\u2019s exams are typically more \u201cvanilla\u201d but also often end up tricky in that students often make mistakes in ways we don\u2019t expect; the tough points of Rajiv\u2019s exams are generally more along the lines of \u201cokay we expected this to be hard but it was harder than we thought.\u201d\n\nRajiv was also typically pushing the pace of the course pretty hard \u2014 in my time there, he pretty much added one new topic every year, but based on your comments, it seems like it\u2019s somewhat stabilized.",

            "comment": "Overall, this is a solid (and very thorough) guide to the course concepts \u2014 with the caveat mentioned above that different versions of the course can differ in content. The TeX and graphics in particular are very nice. The intuitive explanations can lack rigor, but it should serve as a handy companion to the course materials. Some notes on the graph portion:\n\nThe claim that \u201cwalks can be turned into paths\u201d should be made slightly more precise \u2014 I believe the point you\u2019re getting at is \u201ca walk from x to y can be turned into a path from x to y,\u201d which is evident from the explanation afterwards, but not the blurb itself\n\nThe \u201cmaximal path property\u201d has a couple issues. For one, a maximal path is any path which is not contained in a strictly longer path (i.e. cannot be extended). This is different from a path of maximum length \u2014 you can have very short maximal paths. However, it is true that the latter forms a subset of the former so it\u2019s generally safe to just pick a path of maximum length when you\u2019re not sure (since these generally lend themselves to contradiction, you now have another avenue through which to produce one). Additionally, the well-ordering principle shouldn\u2019t be required here, since all graphs considered in the course are finite (or at least they were when I last saw the material). On a similar note, the well-ordering principle/minimal counterexample technique is one which was part of the course in my time there (though perhaps it no longer shows up) and which would fit appropriately alongside induction, as the two assumptions are logically equivalent.\n\nIt might also be good to have a discussion on graph induction (or more generally, induction on objects more complicated than algebraic expressions). You should generally start with an instance of the k+1 case (the object you\u2019re trying to prove something about) and delete something to go to the k case, rather than starting at the k case and adding something on. (As an aside, this usually isn\u2019t strictly necessary, but other methods typically end up making the solution much more complicated). This strategy falls under the more general umbrella of \u201cto prove a \u2018for all\u2019 claim, start by picking an arbitrary member of the domain.\u201d The reasoning here is a bit subtle but intuitively, there can be instances of the k+1 case which can\u2019t be reached by addition.\n\nOne example of this in play is the (false) claim that any graph where all vertices have positive degree is connected. For the base case, start with k=2 and clearly there is only one valid graph, which is connected. Then if you assume this is true for k, consider how you can get a graph with k+1 \u2014 well, if you start with k vertices and edges, clearly when you add in the new vertex, it must have an edge to an existing vertex to have positive degree, so the graph is connected. But the claim is not true \u2014 we just never got to consider the cases that do not arise as a result of adding a single new vertex and edge(s).",

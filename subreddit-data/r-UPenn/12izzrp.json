I understand that Penn doesn\u2019t force kids to live on campus all 4 years like these schools, but does the housing system at least promote some degree of finding a community within the building you live? Or is is really just a building where people only come to sleep? Any insight would be appreciated!",

If you frequent these, you\u2019re likely to see some of the same people repeatedly and get to know them. Plus, each RA holds some event for their hall every month or so.\n\nI don\u2019t think college houses are the primary way people meet most of their friends, but you can definitely meet new people through them. Not sure how it all compares to the other schools you mentioned, though",

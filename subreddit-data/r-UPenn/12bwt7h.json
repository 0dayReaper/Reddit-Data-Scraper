            "comment": "Probably not a hot take, but some people take more time to figure things out. I coasted through my freshman year with no clubs or activities or anything because ... there just wasn't anything I was passionate about. It was tough being surrounded by people who all seemed to love something super intensely - environmentalism or education or startup culture - and I just ... didn't love anything like that.\n\nI got into computer science later on in my junior &amp; senior years and it clicked pretty hard for me. I'm glad I took some chances on different subjects and found something interesting to me. I still ended up in kind of a weird career path but eventually found my way back into cs. \n\nMy advice would be just keep an eye out for anything that excites you and lean really hard into that. If you find yourself coming back to certain topics or subjects or projects over and over, lean into it and explore more. Sometimes you'll hit a dead end (like ceramics lol, fuck ceramics) and it's okay to let things go. Don't force it.\n\nWe aren't really taught much how to \\*be\\* happy. We know what happy looks like, but how do we \\*do\\* happiness? One place to start is to try to observe what's satisfying to you and put more of those things in your life. Marie Kondo style... ask if it sparks joy. \n\nAnd just try to be patient with yourself. Some people have it figured out and that's great for them. It sounds cliche, but you're on your own path. You can only be you. If things aren't clicking with you right now, you don't have people you click with, you're not clicking with subjects, just acknowledge and move on, and be observant/ready when something you do click with comes along.\n\nYou will get through this.",

Penn has a lot of people who care a lot about personal branding and all kinds of personalities. They are also young and often naive. I also felt like OP, and I realized pretty late in college that my biggest mistake wasn't being different from the way those people seemed to be, but feeling bad about myself because of that. If you feel lost, you're probably just more honest with yourself than a lot of people. It is not at all unlikely that you'll seem more interesting, valuable, etc in many future situations than the people who seem to have everything figured out from the beginning. Realizing this helped me to be patient with myself and to feel good about the things I did have.",

There are clubs to join that are more service oriented and collaborative clubs that should be relatively easy to get involved with or join as a member even if not as an officer etc..  As far as making friends, it can be really hard, but just be open to doing things with others, participating in events, sitting down with others at lunch, etc. Take a professor out to lunch, get a part time job or volunteer to do something and share your interests with others.  You said you have  \"no Clue what I'm doing\".  That is a pretty big statement. I would dissect it, it is obviously an exaggeration but maybe you do need to refocus your goals, change your major, change your roommate or living situation.  Read your textbooks if this is about not understanding work and just focus more in classes (and go to them). You are not alone for sure!!!  If you are feeling unwell, mentally or otherwise, go to CAPS, join and participate in wellness groups and activities like Active Minds or Penn  Benjamins... etc.. (I don't know which ones are active, but you can find many of them easily and reach out to them to join or to ask for resources).  At the very least you can talk to others and perhaps meet some potential friends and also feel better or get the tools to do so.  Wishing you good health and peace.",

I don't care if you feel like your college experience is being cheated away because of the pandemic.\n\nThere are people who paid way too fucking much money to come back on campus. There are people who cannot return home because of health or other issues. There are people who absolutely has to be on campus for their own personal reasons.\n\nForget about jeopardizing your own life by partying. It's clear that you don't take this shit seriously. However, your actions not only put unnecessary strain on healthcare workers and the healthcare systems, but also are fucking over the lives of your neighbors, classmates, and community members.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/l2whpg/video/cgm5b4w93yc61/player\n\nThe attached video was taken Thursday night. \n\nDo better.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: The specific address of the house is now removed due to mod request. The house is located on Pine, between 39th and 40th. The house is on the even-number side of the street.",

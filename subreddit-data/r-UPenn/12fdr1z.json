Any relevant information would be much appreciated! (If you have anywhere you really like/dislike, it\u2019d be great to know as well!)",

I had the exact same issue as you back when I was finding grad accommodation. Feel free to DM me and I\u2019d be happy to recommend my building or tell you other places to check out that I\u2019ve heard are good :)",

It\u2019s at 4605 Chester ave, which is an approximately 25 min walk from campus and has the trolly literally right outside which will take you to campus in 10 mins. The rent is 945$ and you can get the first month free. Lmk if you\u2019d be interested?",

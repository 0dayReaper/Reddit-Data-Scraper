    "postText": "I did not go home for spring break, I stayed in the northeast. I was fine then, I missed home and all but not the way I do now. Since Monday, I have been feeling this sensation of impending doom, my head filled with memories of when I was younger and in high school and stuff. I haven't felt this way since I got here, and it is making it extremely hard to focus on schoolwork and studying, because I long for nothing but to be home with my friends and family. I don't know why it happened so randomly now. How do I get over it? Is anyone else feeling this way right now?",

Being from philly is an underrated advantage because you don't have to abandon your own life per se when ur in school lol\n\nBut yeah looking back can be.. surreal and homesickness always hurts. You'll get through it",

I miss having classes filled with familiar faces and not having to travel to see my family. I've gone home four times so far (including spring break) and every time it has been relatively boring and I don't even get as much quality family time as I want to. I only miss an idealized version of the past- many parts of high school were rough!! I'm not discounting your experience at all though.",

    "postText": "One of the things that always bothered me during my time at Penn was the lack of school pride. Yeah, sure, Wharton quarterzips are endemic in Huntsman and boomers love buying school-branded nappies for their kids and during spring you can't walk two steps without running into someone wearing a P sweater, but let's face the facts: if a school's pride was based off what people wore, our mascot would be a goddamn flock of geese.\n\nThere's a state school to our northwest that knows a thing or two about pride. Why? Simple: they're better at marketing themselves. And the most important part? They have a catchy phrase to tie everything together: #WeAre.\n\nYou see that hashtag everywhere in State College. On Twitter, at their football games-- hell, they'll even shout it at random campus groups when they walk past. #WeAre has taken over their entire school identity. Their alums can yell \"We Are!\" and be instantly recognized for who they are. What catchphrase do we have, \"Go Quakers\"? \"Yeah, Let's Get Lunch Sometime!\"?  To up our school pride, Penn needs something similar. Something short, catchy, and yellable.\n\nWhich is why I'm proposing a new catchphrase: **#PennIs**.\n\nThis single catchphrase has the ability to take our school pride to the next level. We need to get #PennIs trending on Twitter. We need to yell \"PENN IS\" at the top of our voices at random unsuspecting prefrosh during Quaker Days-- which, incidentally, should be renamed \"Penn Is Days\". Aptly named because it gives freshmen the main thrust of what #PennIs during their time here!\n\nFootball game attendance is-- has been-- declining. If we give the masses something catchy to yell at football games-- \"PENN IS!!\"-- more people will show up. The band can brand #PennIs on the toast before throwing it on the field. Adopting #PennIs might allow us to top Playboy Magazine's Party School Rankings once again. Penn could even partner with Canada Goose to make high-quality winter coats with a #PennIs emblazoned proudly on the sleeves.\n\nSchool pride is shrinking, but if we work hard, we can spread school spirit like never before.\n\n**PENN IS!!!!!!!**",

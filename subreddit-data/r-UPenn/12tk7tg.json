    "postText": "I'm an incoming student looking into this double major, and I'm wondering how feasible it is to graduate in 4 years with it.   \nWhat I'm most confused about is whether CIS courses count toward the free electives req for CAS. On Penn's website it says, \"Courses in the Bachelor of Arts Degree are considered Arts and Sciences c.u. if they are courses offered by a department or program in the School of Arts and Sciences.\" Since CIS courses are in SEAS, I would assume they do not count toward the free electives req, but I've seen two ppl on this subreddit plan a schedule with the assumption that CIS courses do count toward the req.",

So while I don't have specific numbers for you, I can assure that doing a second major in CS from the college is extremely doable in 4 years, it's very common",

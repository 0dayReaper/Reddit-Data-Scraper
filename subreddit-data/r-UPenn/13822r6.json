    "postText": "Hi! I will be attending Penn cas in the fall and I just have a quick question. I am mainly interested in computer science and eventually want to be a swe at a faang company but I\u2019m also interested in quant. Would it be worth it to transfer to seas after my first year or will a cis major at cas be looked at in the same way? I also want to major in math and maybe get other minors at cas as well, so I was wondering if it\u2019s worth it to transfer to seas. \nThanks in advance!!!!",

I\u2019m a math + cis major and I transferred from CAS to SEAS because imo the BSE looks better than the BA and is more attractive to FAANG and trading firms. (I\u2019m saying if you're doing math + cis I think you should do it from seas not the college. Not commenting on other majors + cis)",

The courses that you would take freshmen year can also count between both cas and seas (cis 120, cis 160, math 114, phys 150, writing sem, etc), so I think it\u2019d be best for you to try out both cs and other college courses that you\u2019re interested in to see if you\u2019d prefer a liberal education or an engineering one. I\u2019m a math major with a cs minor so feel free to dm me if u have any questions!",

The reason I stayed in CAS is cuz I also want to take lots of humanities so I\u2019d rather take those classes rather than more technical electives. U can definitely make CAS CIS just as/or even more rigorous than SEAS CIS just depends on the classes u take. \n\nPersonally I really like the balance of classes and would def recommend CAS CIS second major if u have broad interests. If ur very engineering focused u prob should transfer cuz ur not gonna like the CAS gen eds\u2014also transfer is very easy I hear.\n\nFeel free to pm cuz I asked the exact same question last year.",

I will have taken math 1410, math 2400 (plan to place out), math 312 by the end of next sem. I\u2019ve taken cis 160. Should I take Math 2020 before Math 360? Should I be taking 314 instead of 312 (trying to avoid this because I have some other hard classes next sem)? My only proof experience is cis 160\u2013not taking the honors math sequence.",

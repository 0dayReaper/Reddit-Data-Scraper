I am an international student and no one really uses LinkedIn, much less college students, where I\u2019m from. I always see people talking about it irl and on here but I\u2019m not really sure what it is, how it works, how to \u201csucceed on it\u201d and what is the point of it when resumes also exist. Any clarification any advice I would really appreciate :)!",

            "comment": "Imo, LinkedIn is useful for 2 main reasons. I'm also international btw\n\n1. If you are interested in a job or career, you can see people who currently work in that position and then see the path they took to get there and also give you a sense of what companies to apply to. This is particularly useful for internationals because you can see what companies will sponsor ur visa\n2. It helps you network. Because you can see who works where, you can easily reach out to them using LinkedIn (or email which is prob better) to chat and get ppl at the firm ur interested in to remember ur name",

It's basically a self-updating rolodex(aging myself here probably) or contact list for your professional network. It helps me get connected to folks I've worked with or went to school with when I'm in need of something like a referral, and I like to return the favor as well. Once you have 3+ years of work experience, recruiters also contact you pretty regularly on Linkedin for interviews, which is useful when you decide you want to explore the job market again.",

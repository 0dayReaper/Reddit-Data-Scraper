    "postText": "Hello everyone, posting again about a possible Penn Pok\u00e9mon showdown tournament for both the fall and spring. Right now we have about 7 people interested. If you fill out the form below it\u2019ll really just ask what you prefer to be the format, possible rewards, and username registration details. \n\nRight now, most people are leaning to Gen 9 OU Singled (tragic i want VGC, but I\u2019ll go with whatever the group wants)\n\nAdd if you\u2019re interested in having a tournament for the summer too. Here\u2019s the link to the form in case you can\u2019t scan the QR code.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/VRUyFrczqD7yP9vg9",

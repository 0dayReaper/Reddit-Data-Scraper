            "comment": "I took STAT 1110 but tbh there isn\u2019t a whole lot of statistics on the MCAT. The most you\u2019ll need is basic understanding of graphs, what does correlation mean, and basic statistical measures such as mean, median, mode. Even things like normal distributions would not likely be tested on the MCAT outside of the significance of p&lt;0.05, so don\u2019t sweat too much on statistics. Unless you\u2019re majoring in Biology or are really interested in Biostatistics, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to take BIOL 2510 especially when taking it in conjunction with CHEM 2510, which won\u2019t be easy regardless of whether you\u2019re taking it in the fall or spring semester.",

    "postText": "\nI\u2019m having a bit of a crisis. For context, I\u2019m an English major hoping to work in entertainment (either creative or business) but I\u2019m starting to think I just don\u2019t have the proper experience or something. For more context, I\u2019m FGLI - so I\u2019m really learning about career stuff as I go along, and I\u2019m in desperate need for a job to be able to survive. I am involved in clubs that surround entertainment and have had an unpaid internship at a podcast studio, but I still feel like I\u2019m lacking something and that I\u2019m not a competitive candidate for internships. For back up, I\u2019ve been applying to communications/copywriting/digital media internships as well. I\u2019ve applied to about 50 summer internships, only to have interviews with 6 and so far 3 rejections from those 6. Still waiting to hear back from the other 3, and I\u2019ve grown very pessimistic. I got an offer for an unpaid internship but it doesn\u2019t meet the requirements for FGLI summer aid which I need to be able to pay my rent. Should I keep applying to internships, or switch my focus to just getting a part time job so I can pay my rent for the summer?  What did I do wrong? Should I have applied to more? If I don\u2019t have an internship this summer, what can I do to ensure I\u2019ll have a job after graduation? \n\nAnyone else in this situation? how are you coping because I\u2019m personally ready to drop out and fuck it all \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab \n\nTLDR: am I fucked for still not having work for the summer as a junior",

I\u2019m not trying to snark but I probably have done like 800 applications at this point. Your conversion rate from application to interview is pretty high but I\u2019d suggest applying double to triple the number you have done at this point. What you are experiencing is honestly pretty normal as this is a shit year too and there\u2019s a ton of ppl who don\u2019t have shit.",

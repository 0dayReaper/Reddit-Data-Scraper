    "postText": "I'm applying to medical school this cycle and wondering how previous applicants who completed CIS 160 listed the course on their AMCAS application. I'm unsure if the course is officially considered a math course or a computer science one and worry my application verification will be delayed if the application service disagrees with how I list it. The [AAMC course classification guide](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school-amcas/amcas-course-classification-guide#collapse-223917) is unhelpful on the matter. I'm leaning towards (and would benefit from) a CIS classification.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I saw the settlement amount and thought it was a victory for Penn, particularly if you take the settlement amount and divide that by the number of students.  For me, as a parent of a senior, I felt and believe still that the pandemic's affect was the loss of experiences, learning and opportunities that are irreplaceable by money.  Accordingly, I was hoping that Penn, with its large endowment and motto to use knowledge for good, could come up with free or subsidized experiences and opportunities that would enhance their careers and overall education.  This could be a free summer session, a study abroad opportunity, free networking, conference and other types of academic or networking retreats, discounted master's or doctoral tuition...  things that are tangible and meaningful that a graduate or current junior or senior affected by the pandemic can avail themselves of.  Little thought was put into making meaningful enhancements to a college experience that was substantially diluted, without any significant discount. Penn could still be the leader in this effort which does not need to include a cash payout. Waiting.",

            "comment": "Seeing this post, I cannot help but reflect upon the many intense efforts of the Penn community, students, teachers and staff, to address social injustices, such as to cause Penn to invest in affordable housing and to solve the UC Townhomes problem, to perhaps pay PILOTs, and any number of important issues facing society.  I understand these causes, I support some of them to varying degrees.  I note that all of these efforts have one thing in common, Penn it is argued, should spend 10s of millions to 100s of millions of dollars to address these issues over time. And Penn has agreed to apply substantial funds towards these causes, in certain ways, by way of compromises that are ongoing.  But, Penn won't use its spectacular resources to correct the most obvious of problems with the watered-down education and experiences given to students during the pandemic.  Is this not Penn's core mission?  You cannot recoup a semester in quarantine or argue that an online course is anywhere near as meaningful as an in person experience.  I would argue that Penn's first mission is to the education of its student body and I am somewhat surprised that the passionate efforts and energies of protest and dissent have not found itself to address Penn's core purpose.",

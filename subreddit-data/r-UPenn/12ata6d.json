            "comment": "Hi! I live in a 1b/1b in Graduate Hospital, which is right next to Rittenhouse square. Internet is about $35 a month (though you might be able to get some new customer deals), water also $35 a month, no gas (heat is central air), about $150 electricity\n\nThat being said, I used to live in a 2b/1b in Fitler Square (also next to Rittenhouse Square) where water and gas were paid by the landlord, electricity was about $50/month and internet was the same price as now. Only moved from there because they didn\u2019t take dogs, otherwise I\u2019d have stayed because it was a really good deal.\n\nHappy to give more details if you want",

I lived in one of the two I just mentioned, but a friend lived in the other and had the same experience in terms of price of utilities and rent. Happy to give more details about renting in the area more generally as well, feel free to DM",

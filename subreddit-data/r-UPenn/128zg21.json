Just be careful when you go because campus sketchiness goes from like 20% to 80% once you cross 40th and market. If you\u2019re gonna go later at night, walk in a group or Uber or something. \n\nI also used to love Terakawa (40th and Walnut/Sansom) right in front of Acme, but these days they\u2019re just okay. \n\nYou can also try Kpod",

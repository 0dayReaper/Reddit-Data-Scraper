            "comment": "Depends on the degrees. Especially if it\u2019s uncoordinated, it can be a ton of extra classes that fill up your schedule. I personally would rather take the interesting/useful classes or maybe pick up a minor instead of an extra degree, since (in my case) there\u2019s not really any huge benefit from an additional degree. I would lose more by not being able to take fun non-major classes in a busy schedule.\n\nThat being said, I do know people doing dual degrees and it is possible, but it\u2019s not easy. I would ask yourself if you really need the degree part of a second degree. You don\u2019t have to answer this immediately though, especially if you\u2019re an incoming freshman \u2014 you can see for yourself if it\u2019s something you want to do, or ask people who\u2019ve already done it before.",

It's pretty difficult not because of the number of classes but because the classes are usually much more difficulty than the other ones, since it's two STEM degrees. But it also depends on which ones you choose, MSE + CHEM is less difficult than CMPE + Physics. Take a look at the sample schedule. Also there are things that make it easier for example VIPR 399 credit or using VIPR 120 for engineering ethics. Overall, it's also harder because you don't get as much of a buffer from hard stem classes, because you have very few loose credits to choose outside of majors.",

For example, you should try to take courses that fulfill multiple requirements so you don't have to take as many classes per semester. Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions!",

It really depressed my grades across the board\n\nI wish I\u2019d used my electives on interesting classes. Some of my favorite classes were the random ones I took like bio or criminology.  And I wish I had some 4 class semesters instead of 5 every time, so I could have focused on getting better grades.\n\nI don\u2019t think the second degree has helped me much, if at all.",

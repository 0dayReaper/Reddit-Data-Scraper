Has anyone on here attended sees/pif? And If so, what did you think about the experience?\n\nSide note: I\u2019m interested in the legal studies and business ethics major at Wharton, and the HSOC major in CAS. Any current majors want to talk about their classes, and what they love the most about their program?",

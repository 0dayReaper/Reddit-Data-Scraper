    "postText": "As an incoming freshman, if the highest level of math I\u2019ve ever taken is only AP Calculus BC, and I\u2019m not super talented at math, do you think I would struggle a lot as a math major? I feel like people normally majoring in math are really good at it, so I was wondering if you think the classes would be too hard for someone who is only average at math.",

            "comment": "That depends on how you're measuring your math skill level. Penn Math is widely hated by many students that take the intro calculus sequence, but as someone who enjoyed those courses (I switched to a math major from PPE because of how fun calculus is here) I think there's a reason for that: the courses are taught in a way that encourages, develops, rewards, and occasionally requires a mathematical intuition. Many students come into Penn having only ever memorized and applied formulas, without developing any sort of mathematical thought, which is very possible to do in HS &amp; AP calc. Many of the questions on the weekly calculus quizzes, especially in Math1410, require a level of conceptual understanding that is not required or encouraged in most HS math coursework. \n\nIf you're the type of person to understand where formulas come from and why they work, and perhaps to occasionally derive/develop/tweak/prove formulas on your own, then you have plenty of intuition. If you feel like math consists primarily of moving around symbols that you don't understand in the way that you're told, or your only answer to \"why does this solution work\" is \"because that's what my teacher did on the board,\" then you will likely struggle in Penn calculus. It's entirely possible to, through Penn's intro courses, develop that intuition, but it will take work! The honors sequence, which is proof-based, will work specifically at developing that intuition, but it is entirely possible (and equally as necessary) to do so in the standard, primarily computational courses. \n\nGenerally, math at Penn isn't too bad! Homework assignments usually aren't too long -- 4-6 proofs per week per class -- and if your intuition is keen and you see the reasoning quickly, those proofs don't take too much work or time. It's a small(er) major at 13 required classes, and the intro calculus classes count towards several other majors and minors, so it's easy to make math work with other programs of study. It's great for the brain, a wonderful subject to study, and will impress most people you talk to (lol) so I say at least give the intro courses a try and see how you fare!",

Most people who hate the math department hate the lower level courses that are either gen ed requirements or general part of STEM majors. Once you get into the math-specific courses it is an entirely different experience.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t be afraid to take a course like real analysis early; this is a very useful course also for applied topics and if you want to take probability theory sooner rather than later.",

            "comment": "The math major is harder because of how bad the department is more than because of how difficult the classes are. Sucks but if you take all the honors version classes early on 1610, 2600, etc... It will be MUCH more tolerable since the upper level classes are apparently much better. \n\nMath 1410 will make you hate math, life, and yourself. Do not take it if you can take 1610 (which is recommended for math majors) instead.",

It seems like KCEH is peaceful and other 4 year dorms too, but other recommendations? Thank you in advance!",

Only thing is they have no singles so you would be required to live with a roommate if you\u2019re fine with that. Overall, the 4 year housing if less social because freshmen only housing is full with kids that want to get out and know one another.\n\nFor this reason, if you choose a \u20184 year housing\u2019 i would say don\u2019t choose Lauder as it will be only Freshmen for the next couple of years",

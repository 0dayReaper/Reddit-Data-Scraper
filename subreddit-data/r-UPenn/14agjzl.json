    "postText": "Hey, I'm sure you've seen a few of these. I was committed to Duke, but just today I got off the UPenn waitlist. I am genuinely unsure of what to do, so I'm asking you guys! If you could give any insight as to why to picked Penn that would be incredible. Programs at both unis are similar. Only thing I can really see is the difference is sports which I don't really care for.\n\nAlso, I was admitted to CAS, but I want to do CS which is in SEAS, is it easy to transfer from CAS to SEAS?\n\nI also fully understand that this is a subreddit for UPenn students and that I will be getting a very biased answer pool. For this reason I have also made a post on the Duke subreddit. Thank you for your help!",

But like the other comment pointed out, I absolutely love Philly as a city and couldn't see myself being as happy in Durham.   \n\n\nAs for transferring to SEAS for CAS, it's generally not difficult - as long as your GPA is okay and you've taken the SEAS prereqs to show that you'll probably graduate on time, you should be good",

Personally I love Philly as a city which is biased to your point, but I'm in grad school now with a bunch of ppl who went to Duke for undergrad, and wayyy more of my friends stayed in PHL post-graduation than their friends stayed in Durham. take that for what it's worth and good luck!",

Anyway, I have no other comments except that if you do decide to enroll at Penn and plan to transfer to SEAS make sure that you take classes that will count for SEAS credit in your freshman year and/or focus on general requirements that will be accepted by SEAS. You may have issues graduating in 4 years because I have heard that there are a lot of credit reqs for SEAS people. (If anyone from SEAS has any advice on this, please expand further since I am a CAS student.) Best of luck on this decision and also remember that Philly winter and summer will be very different than Durham winter and summer.",

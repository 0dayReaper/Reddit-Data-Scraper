And it can become overwhelming to go through them all, esp with some slumlords out there.  \n\nWhat size are you looking for and what\u2019s your budget?  Are you able to tour them in person before making a decision or will you do it virtually and then decide.  For me, seeing some in person really helped with deciding.",

If you have the opportunity to see them in person (or one of your roommates), that would be ideal, but there are places that will also do virtual tours in case you can\u2019t make it in person.",

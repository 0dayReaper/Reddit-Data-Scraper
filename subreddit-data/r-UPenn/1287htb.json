It will be easier for you to focus on engineering and in the long run you\u2019ll have an advantage. I know some people in my class ended up working for hedge funds on Wall Street with an engineering degree so you can make it work",

            "comment": "SEAS alumni and it's been awhile. My two cents is it would be easier to transfer to Wharton than double major but I know very little about the process of transferring between schools. \n\nPenn engineering is no joke - especially if you overdo the partying but this can also be true just based on your study habits, educational background, and personality. If you are an engineer who is looking outward, don't neglect forming good friendships directly within your engineering school class.  I fell behind on my studies very fast and isolated my issues instead of asking for help. I was lucky to catch up by somehow being better in the more advanced classes junior/senior year when computer use, design, and presentations became more important.\n\nIn hindsight, it took a very long time for me to put my engineering degree to happy use. Not that it wasn't worth it - the classes I took still prepare me for taking on new scope 15+ years out and it's incredibly easy for me to work in renewables (which makes me happy). But despite the many advantages a Penn engineering degree brings, my Wharton friends seemed to have an easier go of it, both during and after college. \n\nSo again without knowing more, if you are seriously thinking about a Wharton major, my advice would be to skip the party scene freshman year, work very hard to make top grades, and start making your transfer interests known midway through first semester.\n\n And don't worry if you end up having to take an extra semester or summer classes in order to do so! One of my good friends took an extra year at Wharton (the market really, really sucked for business students when we graduated) and he's doing incredibly well as a VP for a Fortune 50 airline.",

    "postText": "Hey y'all, Im looking for some advice from current students who have had to request an incomplete on a course. Im a junior in CAS who has been dealing with some personal and mental health related issues for a couple of months now. On top of that, my finals workload this year is the worst it has ever been (50+ pages worth of papers and a cumulative STEM exam all due on the same date). I've been trying to time manage the best I can but I'm seriously struggling to keep my head above water. \n\nIm wondering if talking to a professor about taking an incomplete in one class is a good way to get some relief? With the Dean's list being gone and not having any worries about graduation, is there any more unintended consequences or related issues with taking an incomplete? Thanks!",

The only thing is make sure you finish your incomplete work by the deadline next semester \n\nOtherwise you\u2019re right, it changes on your transcript after you finishes it from I to the grade, and as long as you finish, it should have no ill effect on you",

If you don\u2019t get it done by the next semesters deadline it could turn into an F. Sometimes you have to work with an advisor. I\u2019d look under the specific schools guidelines. \n\nThose are a lot of the negatives but there are so many benefits as well especially if you really need it so asking the professor is best!",

            "comment": "Back when I was at Penn I, too, used incompletes when I was really struggling with my mental health. Give yourself a break, take an incomplete to allow yourself to breath. Also, I hope you're seeing someone about how you're feeling, I wish wish wish I'd reached out for help sooner. I'll also add that, those mental health issues meant that, some of those incompletes wound up as \"withdrawn.\" Not the result I wanted at the time, but, in retrospect, it didn't impact my academic or professional ambitions in any discernable way, so try to make sure you're ok before you start worrying over an incomplete.",

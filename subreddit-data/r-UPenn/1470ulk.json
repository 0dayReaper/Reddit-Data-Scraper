But Mallouk ensures that the class Emma is a B on every exam (he give bonus points if it\u2019s below) and he allows a cheat sheet every exam, and for the final he lets the class vote for in person vs online (online is the way to go)",

I don\u2019t know about more recent semesters, but he also included a small amount of biology/biochemistry at the end of the course when I took it back in 2020. As long as you took some decently rigorous chemistry courses in high school you should be fine.",

However, from personal experience, Cirri does a tad bit better in explaining concepts. \n\nAs for exams and such, Cirri make sure you fully understand the concepts, which I think is very important especially for orgo. Mallouk is more of you could either try deeply learning the concepts or you just memorize it. Both has a unique way of teaching. \n\nSure, Cirri's exams may be a bit harder, but it is NOT impossible. If you put in the work, you can do well. \n\nI personally found Cirri to be more fun and engaging. ngl, cirri's class was my favorite.\n\nTake this as you will :/",

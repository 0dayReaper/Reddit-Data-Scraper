[This](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/independent-student) says FAFSA considers you financially independent if you are married (meaning your EFC reflects your income instead of that your parent(s)/guardian(s)). Particularly for students who are on a lot of aid but have an EFC &gt;0, it seems like marriage would also work out financially not too bad.\n\nNo actual advice or recommendation to go out and marry anyone, but kinda nutty if there are no catches",

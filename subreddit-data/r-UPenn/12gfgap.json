You can do SWE if you want to maximize pay early on but you'll have to take some more cis heavy electives, which would make the workload pretty hard. Not sure how it compares in terms of gpa, most engineering classes are curved to similar levels so gpas across majors are pretty similar. \n\nA lot of SSE majors go into finance but that's all of Penn really, engineering doesn't pay as much.",

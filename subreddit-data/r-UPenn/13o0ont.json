The actual workload is low with just a weekly problem set that is graded on accuracy but you have 4 midterms and a final covering 2 semesters of bio in 1 semester so you will still have a lot of reviewing to do, luckily they post all of their past exams so you can take those and they are very representative of the exam questions with some being exact copies.",

This can definitely be time consuming, but the workload depends on how strong your bio background is coming into college, etc.",

    "postText": "Hey, I\u2019m currently looking for volunteering opportunities and considering about the Penn vet center. Can anyone please share their experiences overall, the application process, what do they do when volunteering and is it possible to just walk the dog instead of doing too much of the busy works like file scan, cleaning, videotaping as listed on the webpage? Thank you so much!",

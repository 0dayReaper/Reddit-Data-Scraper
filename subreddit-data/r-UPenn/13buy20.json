The workload is low, and the language immersion is phenomenal as all the instructors are Deaf. I highly recommend taking ASL!! \ud83e\udd1f\ud83e\udd1f\ud83e\udd1f",

            "comment": "ASL isn\u2019t bad, but in comparison to other languages, the workload is heavier. There are a lot of before class preparations where you are expected to know the material before even being taught it. Not just that, but there are several papers that you write for the class along with something called video journals that are due often. The workload isn\u2019t hard, but it is a lot when having to take other classes.",

I've never taken an ASL class at Penn, but I wouldn't assume that they're easier than any other language -- the grammar of ASL is different from English, and it operates in a different modality. If your difficulty with foreign languages is speaking them out loud, I suppose it would make sense as a choice, but otherwise not necessarily. \n\nIf you're looking for easier language \\*classes\\*, then you may want to check out Hungarian, Polish, or Zulu -- classes for smaller languages are more desperate for students, so they tend to be very forgiving. I took Polish and it was pretty much an automatic A as long as you showed up and did homework.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming exchange student set to come to Penn in Fall this year (: I had a few questions about how the course registration process works:\n\n1. Are we allowed to add/drop/swap classes during the entire registration period from mid April till shortly after the term begins? Or are there specific windows/rounds for registering? (My home university does the latter)\n2. Are there any restrictions on how many times we can add/drop/swap courses, or are we free to change our course list as we like until the course selection period ends?\n3. Are registrations on a first come first serve basis, and if so is securing courses generally competitive? Understand that this may vary based on the course, I'm planning to take mainly Psychology courses (PSYC 1210, 1440, some undecided 2Ks) if that helps!\n\nThanks in advance for the help, really appreciate it! :)",

            "comment": "1. typically no, there will be a period for advance registration though im not entirely sure if you have access to that due to you being an exchange student. for current students, that period has already ended, though penn may have a time specifically for exchange students to do some sort of advance registration. after schedules are sent out, add/drop period begins and continues until a few weeks into class, after which you\u2019ll still be able to drop a course but not add one. \n\n2. you should be able to change your schedule as much as you like until add/drop period ends, though once classes have started i would recommend not swapping around too much because you\u2019ll likely miss a bit of class content (most classes start teaching in the first week, if not the first day)\n\n3. advance registration is not first come first serve, there is an algorithm that takes into account class size/major/grade level and it assigns you classes based upon that. not everyone gets all of their choices though, so don\u2019t count on getting every class you\u2019re wanting to take. once add/drop period begins, then classes are first come first serve; i.e you can add classes as long as they aren\u2019t full. if you want a certain class but it\u2019s full, penn course alert is a great resource as you can sign up to receive a notification when someone drops the class, though keep in mind that that spot will still be first come first serve so if you don\u2019t get to it quick someone else could take it. \n\nhopes this helps and welcome to penn! fall is a great time to be here :)",

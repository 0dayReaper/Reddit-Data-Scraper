    "postText": "Hi all! I'm an incoming transfer student conflicted on majoring between PPE and Political Economy within the Poli Sci Department! I'm definitely interested in Economics, but on more from a theoretical standpoint, and since I'm coming in with a lot of POLI SCI credit, it makes a lot more sense for me to major in either PPE or Political Economy and graduate on time rather than major in purely Econ and potentially spend more, expensive years here. I would love some insight into both majors, and what all of your experiences with them are! Some background, I'm *also* conflicted between pursuing careers in law and consulting, so a major with lots of career diversity would be sick too. Please hit me with any advice! Thank you!",

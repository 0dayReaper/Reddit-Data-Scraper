    "postText": "I'm currently attending a large university (ranked around top 30ish) and was accepted as a junior transfer to Penn. I'm a premed student, and have a very good research position at my current university as well as several volunteer positions. With the transfer, I'll have less than two years to start all over again (though I do plan on taking a gap year), and at the same time trying to maintain my gpa (Penn being a lot more academically rigorous than my current college).\n\nPenn transfers/premeds, in your opinion is it still worth it to attend Penn as a junior transfer? I'm super grateful that I'm given the opportunity to choose in the first place, but I'm just worried that I'll choose Penn for the prestige when it might be better in the long run to stick with my current school.\n\nThanks in advance for all your advice!",

If you already have a good standing with volunteer work, leadership positions, research at current university, I don't think it' worth the time and effort to transfer to a new school where you have to start all over. Plus, from GPA point of view, it's easier to get better grades for pre med science requirements also.",

Penn has core strengths in economics, physics, engineering and finance/healthcare management, and I know plenty of premeds here who have gone this route and benefited a lot. if you simply plan to do a bio major here, please check out the courses offered, professor names, clubs/orgs, etc and see how that compares to your current school. chances are it's not too different.",

As long as you go to a decent school, have a high gpa, and do well on MCAT, you'll have a good shot for med school. \n\nMed school is going to be hella expensive and there is no reason to take on debt and stress just to graduate from Penn. IMO transferring this late would be a very bad idea.",

    "postText": "I'm trying to choose between BIOL 4004 (Immunobiology) and BIOL 3310 (Principles of Human Physiology) to fulfill one of my major requirements. One of my minor classes for this semester got cancelled so I need to fill it with something, and am not sure which to take.\n\nFor info, I am also taking Cell Bio, Orgo 2, and Evolution and Ecology of Infectious Diseases. This would be my 4th class (but also 4th STEM class) this semester. I have heard that 3310 is very much memorization based, which I am pretty decent at, at it is at (kinda?) a better time than 4004 (TR 12:00 - 1:30 vs M 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM, respectively). 4004 has slightly easier ratings on Penn Course Review, and if I take it I will have zero classes on both Wednesday and Friday, vs having one recitation on Wednesday (and possibly 3 midterms on one day). \n\nI have a pretty good idea of what 3310 will entail, but has anyone taken 4004 that can give me more info on it? I think I would like the subject material better for 4004 anyways, so that is what I am leaning towards.\n\nThanks in advance!",

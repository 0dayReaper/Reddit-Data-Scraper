I have gotten admission to Upenn's IPD masters program and trying to get students' or alums' perspectives on this course. \n\n\\- What kind of internships and jobs do students mostly get into since the program scope is soo vast? Any info on salary range or compensation after IPD?  \n\\- Do you get to collaborate with students outside your program eg from all schools like SEAS, Wharton, Design?\n\n\\- Feedback on the level of design thinking and user research learning there?\n\nIf you have taken classes in common with IPD folks or are a student there, what has been your experience like? Any input you have for an admitted student?",

            "comment": "Internships, jobs and salary vary drastically. Many continue in industries they were from originally but some do make the leap into product management, strategy or UI/UX. \n\nJust keep in mind some transitions are harder than others. Yes IPD has components of mechanical engineering or industrial design but it's going to be extremely tough to get into those career paths without a background in them.\n\nRecent IPDers have ended up in all kinds of places, from Tesla and Apple, to big consulting firms, as well as startups, boutique design agencies and education. But then again, many have struggled to find work as well. \n\nWhen you are given this much freedom to do all kinds of stuff you can end up not doing anything in particular.\n\nMost of the classes are not going to be IPD core classes so you will inevitably collaborate with other students from SEAS, Wharton and Design. You also have a lot of freedom to find classes beyond the list from Penn Nursing, Neuroscience, Bioengineering and more so you are not restricted to those three.\n\nDesign thinking and user research is infused into everything we do here. It's important but you're going to be sick of hearing that phrase by the end of your 1st semester.\n\nIf you are wondering about courses ask students before you ask faculty. Some have a tendency of recommending shit courses.",

IPD will definitely give you a more holistic understanding of Product Design but it won't turn you into an engineer if you weren't already one.\n\nYou can maybe land a spot as a UX or service designer, but there are more engineering roles than design roles in tech companies.\n\nFor some people who did their undergrad elsewhere, leveraging the name and network has worked out for them but no guarantees.",

I chose Penn because I would get to work on projects I wouldn't be able to anywhere else.\n\nThere are so few hardware designers in tech companies that your best bet to get into Silicon Valley is to join a top agency like Frog or Ammunition. This, I think IPD is not so good at. The program is better at channeling people into corporate or startup roles than design agencies.",

Now of course not every project by everyone is amazing, but still people are making robot arms, medical devices for motor function rehabilitation and turning food waste into containers but none of that is publicised. Instead, it looks like we pour candles and prance around all day.\n\nIn terms of unique opportunities. I'm not aware of anywhere else where you can enter with no engineering background and take hardcore graduate level data science or mechatronics classes, or come with no psychology background and take a cognitive science class.\n\nIPD also has a much stronger focus on the business aspect. Truth be told I didn't care much for that and didn't come here to learn business, but within just a few months that completely changed. I think if there's anything I take away from IPD, it's the business stuff. It's more important than I could ever imagine. I always thought of innovation as design and engineering but none of that matters without the business side.",

Engineering courses vary drastically in difficulty from into HTML/CSS, to making physics simulations for computer graphics or robotics. \n\nObviously not all are realistic but professors are usually pretty good at gauging if you're gonna manage. Many non-engineering IPDers have taken notoriously difficult engineering courses like Mechatronics or Intro to Robotics. There definitely is extra EFFORT involved, but as someone with a BA, I got to make a self driving robot last semester.\n\nWhen it comes to business courses, it's a lot easier to get into ones from Engineering than Wharton (seats are reserved for IPD in the case of Engineering Entrepreneurship 1). This is going to vary depending who you ask but I'm fine with only doing buisness classes from Engineering. They have a pretty good variety (look up EAS) and some of the professors are from Wharton anyway.\n\nBut if taking a Wharton class is a big deal for you it's still doable. You just have to go for the 8:30am section when everyone else is still sleeping.",

            "comment": "Hey! I'm an IPD First Year and congrats on your admission!\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. The internships and jobs that IPD students pursue vary widely, as the program is highly customizable to each student's interests and career goals. Some common paths include product management, strategy design, industrial/product design, UI/UX design, consulting, or UX research. Regarding compensation, it is difficult to provide a range as it greatly depends on the individual and their experience level (my cohort ranges from fresh grads to 15+ years of work experience). However, our alumni network is quite extensive and global, so you may be able to connect with individuals who are working in fields that interest you.\n2. Yes! One of the strengths of the IPD program is the academic freedom to take almost any course you're interested in, so you will have the opportunity to collaborate with students outside of your program. For example, I come from an engineering background, but I am currently taking a class in Penn Nursing and it's been awesome having the opportunity to learn from the perspectives of student nurses. If you ask my friends, I'm sure they would agree as well (they're taking classes such as Mechatronics, Human Factors Engineering, Semi-Fictitious Realms, Engineering Negotiation, and more).\n3. I personally appreciate IPD's take on Design Thinking. I think what sets IPD apart is the emphasis on creating products that embody the three schools that we draw from: design, engineering, and business. Not only are we taught how to make products that are useful for people, but we also learn how to make them functionally work and how to successfully market them through good business practices (One of our required courses is Engineering Entrepreneurship I and I cannot tell you how useful that class is. Highly recommend taking it with Prof. Babin). While I wish IPD provided more opportunities for user research, they intentionally require us to shorten initial user research to make time for multiple project iterations based on user feedback later in the semester, emphasizing the idea of MVPs. Overall, it balances out and gives students the chance to perform user research in multiple rounds with activities such as co-creation or functional prototypes.\n\nA few notes I'd like to add:\n\nI've had a few people ask me why IPD seems like a generalist program, but I actually view it as an opportunity to mold the program to your personal wants and goals. The IPD core classes teach you the principles of design thinking, but the majority of the program is an opportunity for you to work on teams to practice and explore those principles on projects of your choosing. Outside of the core classes is where you can specialize and take any course you're interested in. The curricular freedom is an excellent opportunity for you to grow your knowledge in whatever you want, but it is truly up to you to capitalize on it. Also, be advised, many of your peers will be making career pivots, so class at times may seem trivial to you but might be an entirely new experience for your classmate. Although this might seem bad, it's actually quite refreshing and fascinating to see how people from other backgrounds approach different problems. It's what truly makes this program unique.\n\nI also do want to note that IPD's cohort is one of the tightest-knit programs I've seen on campus and even from what I hear from friends at other schools. We are always hanging out with each other, either grabbing a meal or working in the studio. It's great to have such a close connection with peers as it strengthens project teams and opens the door for frequent 2am feedback sessions.\n\nOne last note, if you are a driven person who seeks out opportunities and knows what you want, I think IPD would be a perfect program for you. IPD opens a lot of doors by granting access to everything in our 3 departments (professors, labs, etc) as well as the extensive Penn Network. However, if you aren't willing to put in the independent time or effort, I would not recommend this program.",

However, most of the courses you see on the website are courses that students have taken in the past. It also really depends on your background and experience as you sometimes have to ~~argue~~ give reasons to take a class. If your background and interests align with the class, you often won't have an issue getting into the course. For example, I had to explain my reasonings for taking a Nursing class before it got approved, but since I had a background in healthcare engineering I had a valid argument. The only times you will have issues getting into courses (and trust me, this is rare) is if the spaces are limited and it's a popular class (which honestly are most Wharton courses). I have to say, the curricular freedom of IPD is actually very useful if you have an idea of what you want to do in the future, and it does give you an opportunity to get into new fields without required backgrounds which is something I love about this program.",

    "postText": "Hello! I will be joining UPenn in the MSE-CIS Program this fall and had some questions about it, would be great if someone aware about them could answer it-\n1) Which courses should I take in the first semester/ in the complete two years considering faculty and course load? And which courses should I completely avoid ( maybe due to faculty/ being too hard)\n\n2) What is the current Internship and Job scenes for the current batch in the same program? Are people easily getting them?Also, are there career fairs taking place and do good companies recruit through them?",

    "postText": "Hi - Thanks for your time.\n\nI made a post about this before, but I am a Huntsman student who took a year gap and will join in the fall. I'm trying to graduate as fast as possible because I don't want to pay 90k a year but also don't qualify for AID as an intl HcoL student.\n\n**What is the maximum number of credits by exam courses I can take?** \n\n**Is there a list anywhere of all credits by exams?**\n\n**Can I take placement exams for stuff like** CHEM 1012 &amp; 1022 EQUIVALENCY **and get two credits to slap on my transcript even though I don't have anything to do with it lol? (I specifically did chem in HS btw)**\n\nI don't have any IB/AP credits.\n\nI read before that this credit doesn't count towards CAS/Wharton graduation requirements but then whats the purpose of the credit all together? Is this wrong?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you very much.\n\nReally appreciate.",

            "comment": "Uhhh in theory I think you can do:\n\n* Chem: 1012, then 1022 (1.0 CU each; you must pass the 1012 exam to take the 1022, iirc)\n* Math: 1400, 1410, 2400, 2410 (1.0 CU each; you'd have to take 1400/1410 in the fall then come back for 2400/2410 in the spring, I think). There's also exams for 1300, 1070, and 1080, but I don't remember the rules for which math courses you can have credit for simultaneously. 1400/1410/2400/2410 is the standard calc sequence. 1300 is equivalent to AP Calc AB. I've also never heard of anyone taking and passing *all* of these tests, but it is technically possible.\n* Foreign language: if you score high enough you get an exemption (0.0 CU, not sure if you need to replace them with other credits). Caveat - I have no idea how this interacts with Huntsman's \"target language\" requirements, presumably you just test out of lower levels and skip to the higher courses.\n\nMath credit by exam page says it counts as \"AP credit,\" so it *should* count towards graduation if there are requirements you can count the courses towards. Chem I'm less sure of, ask your advisor and/or the contact email on the placement test info page - I'm pretty sure I had friends count them towards SEAS graduation requirements, so my gut feeling is it should count towards any natural science requirements you have?\n\nThese are the only credit/placement exams that I'm aware of. If you want to graduate early at any cost, your real answer is to take summer courses at cheaper institutions while getting them pre-approved through XCat. But doing that will also mean sacrificing internships and other opportunities.",

Yes, very pricey, but worth it for me since my \"internships\" were remote/WFH (and thus very, very flexible with scheduling). Only would recommend if, like me, your #1 summer opportunities are flexible + leave you with enough bandwith to take a midterm a week (plus do multiple hours of homework/studying a night).",

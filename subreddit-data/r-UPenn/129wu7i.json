    "postText": "I am an international master student at Penn. This is my first year studying in the U.S. and English is my second language.\n\nI got nothing beside my current degree\nThat is means I didn\u2019t get any on-campus jobs or students related leadership (like panelists on a program or school fair, student advisor\u2026.)\n\nI am feeling stressed that I didn\u2019t have anything that worth of saying and I don\u2019t make any great progress here. \nI know it is my first year, but I still have a lot of peers who are also international students, first year, that have those experiences already\u2026.\n\nI am just writing an email to a professor who will teaching in next semester, to ask if there are any RA opportunities. I am even thinking about phd in Stanford, I am eager to get the degree and I m also passionate about my current field\u2026.but the situation now can not satisfied me\u2026..",

My fav is Lauder because it has suites and everyone gets their own room and suitemates. Each suite has a living room and bathroom(s) that suitemates share. I lived in lauder and it is clean. It is also the closest to engineering so if that matters to her then it's even more worth it. \nCVS, food carts and Drexel campus are the closest to lauder. Van Pelt library is also pretty close to lauder. But distance isn't a huge deal because Penn campus isn't huge. The hill which I assume is also a freshman dorm for next year is in front of lauder. Hill has a huge dining hall. Lauder also has a dining hall but it's smaller and more \"bougie\" so it has long lines. Lauder dinning hall times are always Changing. Lauder also has a great courtyard and community BBQs.\n\nEverything is gonna work out eventually for her dont worry too much :)",

            "comment": "Welcome! My D is class of 2026. The freshman dorm situation is changing for next year as they are refurbishing parts of the Quad (this is the traditional freshman dorm quad. Very very old historic bldgs. With many issues - mold, bugs, mice, too hot or too cold). Mine is in Lauder this year and loves it. Lauder was a 4 year dorm but is changing to all freshman next year. It\u2019s the newest of freshman dorms. And each person gets their own room but it is in a suite with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 others. Mine is in 6 Person suite so 6 small bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a living area with small fridge and microwave. These suites are on a hall so you meet others same as you would in a regular dorm. Penn is tough so it\u2019s helpful to have your own room at times. The Quad will still be the place most freshman live but it\u2019s a traditional dorm with 2 to a room and some are very small. Quad is also kind of a party place and is close to frat houses. Lauder is in a great location for engineers as classes are just across street. It borders Drexel but it\u2019s still very much on campus. Hill house is also next to Lauder and that will be all freshman as well. Hill is OK but rooms are doubles and small. She will only get to provide her top 3 choices and then it\u2019s luck. The other option (which mine did) is to apply to a community program that is based in that house. You have to write essay but if u get in then you automatically get that dorm. As to \u201cbest\u201d I would say Lauder. And reason is that you get your own room but still have suite mates. Plus it\u2019s newer and much nicer. There\u2019s also dining hall in the building and at Hill. And it\u2019s super close to engineering classes.",

Lauder can be isolating since people don't really hang out as much in the common areas--it is more like an apartment and you will hang out with the people in ur room 99% of the time. However, lauder is much nicer in terms of food/amenities if that is more important to u. \n\nI had quad. Hated it. Basically lived in hill cuz I disliked it sm. None of my friends are from my dorm.

Hill has an atrium (huge common area + study lounges) where ur basically seeing all ur friends all the time. Quad is more disconnected and people split off into their own smaller groups. On my floor there was close to no dorm interaction, and I barely knew the people next to me. Quad tends to attract more partier types while hill attracts people who are a little more academic-focused (and kinda more friendly/less exclusive from my expereince lol) -- so this was just my preference. \n\nI honestly think hill is the safer option. Ur basically guaranteed to make friends there cuz everyone knows eachother. People def still go out to parties. In quad, u can easily go the entire year not knowing the vast majority of people in ur dorm/hall just due to the way quad is constructed (little common areas, kinda a maze). Quad is only good for like the first couple weeks during NSO.\n\nThis is a hot take but I would rank hill over lauder. Lauder is much nicer in terms of what the dorm looks like. However, lauder is more apartment style so it isnt really condusive to meeting lots of people. Lauder is great for sophmores and above, but for a freshman where u really just want to meet tons of people, I would not necessarily recocomend it.  \n\nDM me if you have more questions.",

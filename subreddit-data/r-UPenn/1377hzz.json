    "postText": "hello, incoming quaker co 2027 here :)\n\ni applied for BFS, but after thinking about it, I'm not quite sure it's the right choice for me. i'm looking to double major in history (14 credits) and dual major in romance languages (18 credits) on the pre-law track (not that this means much), and my main worry is that i won't have enough class space to take all of the classes needed along with my sector requirements since BFS takes up half of my freshmen schedule given that i'll be during ISP. ISP would knock out three of my sector requirements, but it would take 4.5 credit hours, which means that i'll be basically taking an \"additional class\" for the same amount of credit. i took a look at the syllabus and the content looks super interesting, especially given that i'm very humanities-focused and probably wouldn't switch to a STEM major with a very different set of course requirements. however, i do want to explore other classes as well rather than being limited to my major and BFS. to any current BFS students / CAS students in ISP right now, would you say the benefits of BFS outweigh the lack of flexibility in course selection? thank you in advance for the input &lt;3",

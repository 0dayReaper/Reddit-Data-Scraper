    "postText": "As an international student who's got an admit as a grad student, I am wondering how common is it to get RA/TA positions? Do all of the students in a cohort of 40-50 students get that opportunity? Any ways to start getting it from the first semester itself? \n\n\nIf not are there any other options to reduce the heavy cost of tuition for Upenn? I have another offer from Purdue but I would really like to go to Upenn  and am wondering how best can I sustain myself with the high tuition?",

I was talking about a MS program, specifically in Scientific Computing, do you have idea about it and how to find any scholarships/other resources to fund it?\n\nI have heard great things about upenn, but the cost  would almost nix any chance of me enrolling into a PhD after the program. \ud83d\ude05",

I would reach out to your program contact and let them know you are interested. I'm also getting the Grad PLUS loan to help. That should according to the people I spoke with, help buffer the rest of the cost that initial scholarships didn't cover.",

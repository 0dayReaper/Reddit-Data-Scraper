    "postText": "I am a current freshman who wants to internal transfer to MEAM but am unsure of how strict the process is. I have taken all of the freshman year classes for the major I want to transfer into but only took one semester of math this year (Math 1410 first semester) and got retroactive credit for Math 1400. I also am concerned I'll end up with a B-/C+ in Physics 0151 due to extenuating circumstances with the accommodations process here being so slow. My major GPA would be around a 3.2 if this happened and my total GPA would be around a 3.6. \n\nMy question is, has anyone had a similar experience in transferring with a low-ish grade in one of these classes but a GPA that's still decent?",

Honestly none of my advisors tried to stop me from transferring out/transferring in, so I think you'll be ok. As long as you can prove you'll finish the degree on time and aren't too behind, the advisor should sign off on your transfer form.",

    "postText": "Why the fuck are people going to parties? Why? I'm actually afraid that there'll be an outbreak after this weekend. \n\nI get that you've been starved of social interaction and you desperately want your lives to return to normal. I really do. We all do. But we also know how many people have died, how many more people are getting sick every day and how many sacrifices people have had to make. \n\nTo people like this: Fuck you. There's no way you don't know how bad COVID is or you don't know what you're doing. You obviously don't care about the lives of other people at all, but the fact that you'd party even knowing that you're contributing to the prolonging of this entire shitty situation for yourself is unbelievable. You're not just selfish, you have no sense of priorities and the impulse control of a toddler. \n\nMaybe getting COVID will give some of these people a much-needed slap in the face, or maybe it won't, but why does it even have to get to that point? The worst part is that the people who really need to change their behavior are just going to do whatever the hell they want anyway while everyone continues to suffer. \n\nThis post probably achieves nothing aside from letting me vent out my anger, but so be it.",

I don't have any high school friends around either because all their colleges have returned  in person. It sucks not being able to see almost anyone and I really don't want people messing up my chance to come back to campus. Call me selfish and jealous (the latter of which is definitely true), but please know people are making greater sacrifices than you are and sometimes not even by choice.",

Like people were either never gonna do that anyway or the people who would were never gonna be discouraged. Ugh if they can sanction frats for shit like hazing and unauthorized parties during a regular semester they can do something right now! Fuck it just be like Cornell and kick some of these people out as a warning to everyone else.",

Cases are already rising like crazy across the country and my hope is that maybe we'll have some sense of normalcy next summer but at a rate like this it seems crappy. I've literally seen people brag about their whole house getting covid not to mention the fact that a lot of people off campus atm are travelling back and forth going on vacations and coming back home and back to Penn. People literally do not care y'all, especially administration because they refuse to shut down frats that are hosting parties. Hopefully once they get all the freshman on on campus housing things will be better",

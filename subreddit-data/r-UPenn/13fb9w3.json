The pressure is on the faculty to submit on time so that the \u201cbooks\u201d on the semester can be closed out. Faculty are very bad at meeting deadlines, so they build in a grace period assuming some percentage of faculty will be late. There will be increasing pressure on late faculty to get their grades in because you can\u2019t just close out the term if some students don\u2019t have grades (what would they get? Incompletes?) so the longer it takes to close the later the process of actually graduating students starts. That\u2019s not a simple process, lots of checks and rechecks to make sure everything is in order (it would be VERY VERY bad if a degree was conferred erroneously). \n\nSo any pressure on students to submit everything by a certain date is because there\u2019s pressure on the faculty to stay on schedule. If you did everything on time you won\u2019t be punished if anyone else along the chain misses their deadline.",

    "postText": "hey! I am subletting an apartment in Berkeley that is 5-10 mins from the bart stop and has buses right outside the apartment that run to SF. The apartment is around $850 per month with utilities and right next to all the amazing food places in Berkeley. Super safe area and tons of students around you. DM if interested. \n\nPerfect for those interning in SF or east bay",

It's in a big city, offers great connections, there are lots of opportunities for premed students and Perelman is right there, there is Wharton if you're a business student, and a great nursing school. The Penn vet working dog center seems really cool. There's a crap ton of clubs so there is most likely going to be something for everybody. There's also a crap ton of variety of possible courses in so many different fields. There are a lot of research opportunities, and you can get involved with research during your freshman year.\n\nA lot comes down to personal fit too.",

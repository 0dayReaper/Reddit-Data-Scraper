However, if you are an introvert that is not okay with being an introvert and occasionally gets the case of FOMO, this is not the place for you because you will get FOMO a lot.\n\n** edit, also go with your gut. I\u2019m sure you got into other great schools and Penn vs some other T10 or even T30 if you are a hardworking individual will not make a difference. Choose the school that will give you the most happiness and nurture your mental health.",

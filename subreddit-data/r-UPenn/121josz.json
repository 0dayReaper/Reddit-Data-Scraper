When I signed up to do research as an undergraduate student, I was aiming to launch a research career, and I felt fortunate to be in a position to be able to work without earning my living expenses.  It was a privilege to be taken-in, allowed to use very expensive resources and equipment, and to be personally mentored by the multiple faculty members who did so.  It was an amazing learning experience that I never had to pay tuition for, never a burden or requirement in which I felt used as \"labor\".  \n\nMake no mistake about this: undergraduate students are a costly investment in time, resources, and risk to equipment for a lab, and any return on investment doesn't come for years.   There is no way that an undergraduate can be worth what it costs a lab to host them until a year or two has passed.  A lot of labs here at Penn refuse to take undergraduates for this reason.  Most of the labs that do take them are taking them simply because someone took them once upon a time.\n\nEveryone here at Penn chose to attend a major research university, and could have gone most anywhere else.  And then there are hundreds of labs to chose from, and no obligation to stay in a lab that isn't giving you more than you are giving them.  How is it that anyone feels like \"free labor\"?  Would you be happier at a school less focused on research?  Is the dynamic completely different in other fields at Penn?\n\nTo the person who doesn't want to start until Fall '23: definitely reach out now, make a commitment, stay in touch, and follow through with the commitment.  Just make sure that whatever you're doing in the interim is genuinely more important than the research opportunity you are postponing.",

Personally, I would be thrilled and honored just to meet Joshua Bell, and I would jump at the chance to learn from him and perform with him.  Who in their right mind would expect to get paid for taking lessons from him and practicing?\n\nYou've got a lot of faculty here at Penn who are as good in their fields as Joshua Bell is at the violin.  Two of my colleagues stand a good chance of getting Nobel prizes next year.  We are under no obligation to take you, and you will cost us in time and resources if we do invite you to work with us because you simply have no useful skills to start with.  You don't even know how much you don't know.  But we will offer you lessons and expect you to study/practice what we teach you to develop useful skills.  Who in their right mind expects to get paid for that?",

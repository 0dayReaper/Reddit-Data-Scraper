            "comment": "He\u2019s actually a pretty good professor! Even if you\u2019re not an English major or you\u2019re just taking the course to fulfill a Gen-Ed requirement, Eng\u2019s relatively chill and accommodating for many students. Since he\u2019s the director of the ASAM program at Penn, he\u2019s very committed to teaching students about issues Asian Americans face. He even often recommends students to participate in really cool events, including one where he interviewed the director of Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nA lot of the literature he teaches is very relevant to modern struggles of Asian Americans. So long as you can keep up with the literature and discussion, you will do good in the course. He is also very open to students and very much enjoys talking with them. If you decide to take his course, take advantage of his office hours, as you will likely have a fulfilling discussion about whatever appropriate topic you bring to the table. Professor Eng is overall awesome and I would definitely recommend that you take the course. \n\nYou may want to do it soon since spots fill up very quickly.",

FWIW Asian-American students at Penn had to fight hard to keep him here but it's worth it; he's amazing!\n\nVery nice guy and very sharp; has a lot of personal experience that he can pull in to make a conversation that much richer plus very knowledgeable about pretty much everything. Really cool dude; #1 regret was not taking more classes with him.",

I usually check quiz compatibility on several browsers and saw the graph, but there might be something I missed since I don\u2019t have a Mac. Can you email me about this so I can scale your score as if the question wasn\u2019t included in the quiz? Also if anyone else is experiencing this problem, feel free to email me/make a follow up on this piazza post. Right now, I am unsure if this an issue with people\u2019s specific computer or the quiz in general.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t that hard. It\u2019s an even shorter response than his rant.",

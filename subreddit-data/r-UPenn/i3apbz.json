You have to link out to [fall-2020-planning.upenn.edu](https://fall-2020-planning.upenn.edu) for half of it. At least that's on a banner on the corona virus site, I guess.\n\nAnd then! Some of the housing info isn't in the fucking housing FAQs on either of those sites, you have to go to [residential-services.business-services.upenn.edu](https://residential-services.business-services.upenn.edu) and then click on \"Fall 2020\" and dig through their vaguely named sections.\n\nIt doesn't seem like a lot, until you're expanding every single FAQ on every website to track down specific details *you've read before and* ***still*** *can't find* and make sure you're not misinforming the confused little baby Quaker who's trusting you to give them accurate info. Because god knows Penn doesn't care enough to make those details easy to find.\n\nFuck your sleek website redesigns, give me **plain text** FAQs on one page and that I don't need to click through sections and expand little dropdowns to read. I don't give a shit if it's red text on blue background web design straight out of 2002, **I NEED INFORMATION, NOT YOUR STUPIDLY INEFFICIENT AESTHETIC CHOICES.**",

There's even more websites that only sometimes link to each other and when they do oftentimes only provide a little link at the top with no info as to what's on that other website. They pop out new url's like Tribbles and I. am. sick. of. it.\n\n^(also I'm venting a bit of quarantine stress but) **^(god damn)** ^(has this been bothering me for a while)",

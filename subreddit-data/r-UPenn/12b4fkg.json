    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm a hopeful high school junior planning on applying ED to Penn next admissions cycle, and I wanted to ask about the likelihood/ease of being permitted to double major in, say, the School of Engineering and Wharton once you have been accepted by the School of Engineering. By this, I'm referring to applying to dual degree as an Engineering student during freshman/sophomore year, either to double major in an uncoordinated way or to apply to the M+T program (once you're already in the school). \n\nDoes anyone have experience or success with this? Is it possible as long as you are able to keep your GPA up and complete the required forms and classes?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Doing an uncoordinated is easier than MnT. You need to apply to your school in the 2nd semester with some basic courses taken in the school of your dual degree. There is no guarantee to be successful and no released statistics about the odds.\n\nThere is single digit of transfer to the coordinated every year. When people drop out, then you may fill the spots.\n\nYou may apply for MnT then Wharton and SEAS in a single application. Even if you failed MnT, then you are automatically considered in SEAS or/and Wharton.\n\nMnT needs people with a dream, however crazy or small it is, and then WORK to achieve it. You may demonstrate that in your application. Acadmic-wise, achieving 5 in AP CS A, Physics C: M + EnM, Chemistry, Cal BC, Statistics helps SEAS, whereas Macro, Micro, Cal BC, Statistics helps Wharton.\n\n22% of SEAS and 30% of Wharton students work for dual degrees, which is more common than other schools. Imo, dual degrees may be the largest asset of Penn.",

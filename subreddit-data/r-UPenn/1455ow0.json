    "postText": "hi! I'm an incoming freshman in CAS and was wondering if there's anyone doing an uncoordinated dual degree between CAS and Wharton that would be willing to answer some questions. I'm looking into PPE in CAS and Legal Studies and Business Ethics Concentration in Wharton(the legal studies aspect looked interesting bc I want to be a lawyer, but idk if it's really worth it...would appreciate any input on that as well).",

(Apparently law school committees don't like it?)\n\nLaw school admissions largely comes down to GPA and LSAT.  A dual degree means more coursework (possibly sacrificing GPA) and Wharton GPAs are, on average, lower than PPE grades.\n\nKeep things simple and stick to PPE to max your law school chances.",

Law school would much rather accept candidate with ancillary interests in like tech or international relations or something of that sort that can be applied to law.",

First and foremost, of you\u2019re uncoordinating, you better have a good reason. Remember that a Wharton concentration CU is about equivalent to minor, and if Wharton already has a dedicated minor for what you want to uncoordinate with (statistics, legal studies, etc.) there\u2019s actually no point. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re past this and still down horrendous for that wharton degree. It becomes a three step process: 1) Take hellla Wharton classes including all the uncoordinate prereqs (this goes without saying but get a good gpa plz), 2) join hellla Wharton clubs \u2014 \u201cdemonstrated interest\u201d, 3) pick one of the less popular concentration (NOT FINANCE you can always switch later) and churn up some garbage story about it\u2019s your life and everything you\u2019ve done in hs and Penn relates to it. Then Boom, with a little luck, you\u2019ll probably get it. At the end of the day, there\u2019s probably not that much value add if you want to become a lawyer, but if you want to sell or out and become a consultant or banker, this might help",

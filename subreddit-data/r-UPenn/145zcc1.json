It ruins a lot of peoples first semester. I had prior experience and felt like death towards the end of the semester doing this combination. But I think once ur through the rajiv sequence it is worth it cuz u do actually learn more. There tends to be a bias on Reddit esp among cs majors to say things r \u201cdoable\u201d when for most people at Penn it definitely isn\u2019t. So just proceed with caution ig. If I\u2019m being totally honest the people who take 160 first sem r some of the most hardworking people in the university. 160 in the spring is like 5x easier there\u2019s no comparison.",

If you budget your time well (mainly referring to 1600 with Rajiv here) you will be totally fine\n\nAnother option is grinding out multivariable calculus or linear algebra this summer and testing out of 1410 and/or 2400. Good classes but getting them out of the way opens a lot of space for some cool ass electives you can take earlier.",

If you have experience with proofs and enjoy it, 1610 is the move fs, even if you have no experiences with proofs and plan on taking any upper level math, cs, and stat, I\u2019d still push you take 1610 simply because it\u2019s a great, lightweight intro into what\u2019s to come should you choose to pursue some of the theory heavy stem classes Penn offers.",

Taking too many classes without college time management skills can really mess with your ability to go out and socialize in the fall (and there isn't as much of a benefit as you can always tag a credit on to a later semester if you really need it). Taking hard classes just means that you need to make the most of your class time and OH (and also has the reward of preparing for later classes).",

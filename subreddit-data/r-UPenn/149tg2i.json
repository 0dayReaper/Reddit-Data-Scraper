I can't imagine how my Penn experience would have panned out had I not done pre-NSO but that alternative likely would have been a lesser experience.\n\nBut there are other people who walk away from pre-NSO claiming they didn't get anything out it.\n\nI recommend doing a pre-NSO if you're authentically passionate about the program's content and not out of a sense of fomo or because you merely want an early move-in.  Like all opportunities at Penn, you get out of it what you put in.  I wouldn't expect amazing benefits for showing up but then not buying in.   \n\nI spent my junior and senior years involved in the pre-NSO programs, and I can say that they are largely about building strong communities within the freshman class. \n\nThe framing of your question implies that the program will not be worth it to you if it's 'just a fun getaway.'  But the fun getaway (focused around a common interest) is how these strong community gets forged.  So, maybe pre-NSO programs are not for you.",

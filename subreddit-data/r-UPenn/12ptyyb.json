    "postText": "How well do the required CS major classes prepare you for a SWE job?\n\nHow well do they teach you important concepts in programming?\n\nLastly, how would you say that Penn\u2019s CS program compares to other programs in terms of education quality (not based research or job placement like many of the online rankings use as a metric). Specificaly I mean against big CS schools like CMU, UIUC, UMich, and the rest of the ivies? (for instance if you have a friend at these schools or talk to students there, do you feel like they have a much better, worse, or similar understanding of important cs topics (i mainly care abt actual programming not theory tho)",

            "comment": "If you are dead set on going into industry, Penn CS is great. There are a variety of project electives and most if not all the upper-level classes culminate in a resume-worthy final project (compiler, operating system, full stack web app, you name it).\n\nEducation quality for programming principles does not differ much from school to school. The intro programming class uses Java and OCaml and what you learn is (not surprisingly) dependent on the amount of effort and practice you put in.\n\nThe intro sequence covers the basic theory you do need to land a job. Beyond that you have to take one advanced algorithms course and then it\u2019s up to you to pursue theory further.",

I went to Penn but have attended several lectures at CMU and I have to say the lectures at CMU were a lot more interesting and polished with more engaging practical demonstrations. I agree about the projects being a strong point for Penn. The startup culture and options to learn by making some marketable application are good too.",

In any other case Penn\u2019s CS resources are heavily underrated, and Penn\u2019s breadth is much stronger than schools that are only strong in CS.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was just recently admitted to Penn as a transfer student for the Fall 2023 semester, and I will be coming in as a sophomore. I am *sooooo excited* to join such a vibrant community, and I'm hoping some of you can help me with some general questions!\n\nAt my previous school, I was majoring in a unique major called Joint International Relations &amp; Economics (essentially a International Relations and Economics double major). I took an equal distribution of classes for both parts of the major, and most of such classes will transfer over as credits for Penn. However, I'm considering focusing on *one* of these subjects at Penn rather than both, and was wondering if anyone had any insight as to how their experience went in either Economics or International Relations in the College of Arts and Sciences. I'm strongly focused on going to law school, so whichever major provides an \"easier\" (poor diction, but it gets the point across) experience getting a 4.00 in would be nice.\n\nPlease let me know what you all think! Once again, super excited to join the Penn community!",

            "comment": "Econ major here! I think it depends on what you think your strong suit is. Are you stronger with quantitative skills (math, data analysis, etc), which will well prepare you for econ, OR, Are you stronger with qualitative skills (reading, writing etc), which means IR makes more sense. I would encourage you to try both an econ and IR class at Penn to get a feel of both. One thing I also wanna note is that the econ major is pre short (not sure about IR). The IR major also requires a thesis while econ doesn't! Hopefully this helps and feel free to msg me",

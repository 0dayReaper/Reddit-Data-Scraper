    "postText": "Hello everyone, I got admitted at Upenn weitzman school of design in the Masters of Urban Spatial analytics. I am currently working on my application to the Graduate Residence Advisor position. I need some support with how my letter of interest should be like, it would be more helpful if someone went through the same process and got selected. Furthermore I want to know the best college houses for Graduate students and also a breakdown of houses that are more competitive so that I can put a blend of competitive and less competitive houses so that I dont miss my chances. \n\nMy priority deadline is on the 10th I would appreciate any help regarding my questions. Thanks in advance and I\u2019m looking forward to join Penn\u2019s enriched community.",

    "postText": "I graduated from Penn yesterday. I\u2019ve also been on r/UPenn for the past year or so, so I\u2019ve seen the many posts about depression at Penn, the school\u2019s toxic culture, etc., as well as the questions from prospective students asking if everyone at Penn is really so miserable. I\u2019m making this post to say: my time at Penn was incredibly happy. I\u2019m not especially wealthy (wouldn\u2019t have been able to attend Penn without a LOT of financial aid, which I was lucky to receive, although I did have to appeal a few times), and I wasn\u2019t in Wharton \u2014 i.e., I\u2019m not part of the groups that Penn is known for catering toward. But my four years at Penn were characterized more than anything by a sense of extraordinary joy.\n\nThis post is part reflection for me and part advice for anyone who\u2019s wondering where to find happiness at Penn. Here\u2019s a list of things that made me happy at this school:\n\n- First and foremost: a culture of passion about acquiring knowledge, rather than doing the least amount of work possible to get good grades (I know this isn\u2019t true for every department, but I found it to be the case in my arts, humanities, and social sciences classes)\n\n- Opportunity \u2014 including institutional funding \u2014 to pursue what you\u2019re interested in, including research, travel, arts projects, etc.\n\n- Support and mentorship from department faculty (again, this may not be true for every department, but I found that almost everyone was happy to support me if I asked for help \u2014 this includes professors who responded to cold emails without any obligation to help me)\n\n- Extracurricular communities linked by shared passion (shoutout to the theater community and the Kelly Writers House &lt;3)\n\n- The multitude of paths for meeting incredible peers: classes, clubs, dorms, work, being in the same audience for events, etc.\n\nFundamentally, what I think is so extraordinary about Penn is the concentration of brilliant and kind people. The academic departments (particularly the smaller departments, I\u2019ve noticed), the cultural houses, and the work-study job communities stood out to me as hubs of people with shared passions. But even though Penn people are linked by common interests a lot of the time, some of the best experiences I\u2019ve had have been meeting those who have incredibly different knowledge from me. What really links us, I think, is my first bullet point: how much people care about things, especially how much they care about learning.\n\nFor the sake of keeping my Reddit at least a bit anonymous, I\u2019m not posting the specific departments and clubs I\u2019ve been involved with, but feel free to DM me if you\u2019d like recommendations for where to find the kind and passionate environments that have characterized my time at Penn.",

For the moment, let's use all three subjects' names and hope noone really processes that we're doing that. \n\n\"It could set a precedent, if successful, though. We could combine all sorts of subjects and call 'em programs!\n\n\"For instance, imagine an MCPV program, combining Music, Computers, and Pre-Veterinary studies!\"",

So many permitted and time-restricted areas - \"No parking, except permit E, and only on the second Tuesday of each month, but never during a snow emergency, or during an Eagles home game, or ...\"\n\nParking garages around campus are expensive, as well. Market demand and all that.\n\nOnce I learned the ins and outs (much diffetent than Boston with its AWESOME public transportation, and much different than the suburbs of Columbus), I was golden.\n\nI parked my car near my apt. and let it sit.\n\nAround campus - easy walking. The campus is pretty much altogether - even the med school and hospitals.\n\nBiking is easy, too, but always lock it up. Even locked, it can get stolen if you're studying late in one of the academic buildings. (Ask me how I know.)\n\nPublic transportation isn't bad - there are some buses that run an assigned loop around campus every few minutes, and the subway can get you from downtown/center city/etc. to campus easily, too.\n\nBest recommendations if you're coming to study (and not an undergrad who's required to live on campus)?\n\nFind a place near the subway and groceries. Park your car if you have one and let it sit until it's absolutely necessary to use it. Use a bike for the quick/short jaunts that might be time-consuming on foot.\n\nIf an incoming undergrad, most college houses have spots to store your bike inside; you can walk almost anywhere. It's a beautiful campus, in my opinion.",

                    "comment": "Of course! They have an official appeal form, which you should always fill out. It\u2019s also helpful to couch your appeal in terms of one of the official items on their list of reasons why you need more financial aid than your FAFSA says (high medical expenses, COVID, etc) \u2014 you can and should write a letter explaining how this affects your ability to pay for college. But don\u2019t stop there! Call them once you\u2019ve submitted the form, and make sure they make a note in your file saying that you\u2019ve submitted it. Then if they haven\u2019t processed the form by a week or two before the deadline to pay the next bill (which is likely), call again. And again. And again. Learn the name of your specific financial aid counselor, as well as anyone in the office who is especially helpful to you. Essentially: keep bugging them until they process your form, and if they don\u2019t give you enough aid once they do the processing, continue to call until they give you more.\n\nAlso: if you got into Penn while needing financial aid, it\u2019s because Penn thinks you\u2019ll benefit them for a reason other than giving them money. So emphasize the ways you\u2019re an asset to their school, and remember yourself that you are an asset.",

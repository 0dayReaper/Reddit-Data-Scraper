I don't think you can rank twice. \n\nThey removed room preference for freshmen coz apparently we're not eligible to choose the type of room we want. \n\nThere is a personality quiz you take in order to group you with roommates/suit mates with similar characteristics. \n\nYou can visit the housing website and see pictures of the rooms. You can also pre-select roommates.",

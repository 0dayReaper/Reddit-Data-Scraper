Penn has a deal with the city of Philadelphia to fund a certain number of Mayor's Scholarships for Philadelphia students.\n\n2. On top of that, Penn has a fraught relationship with Philly *at best*, and is incentivized to take as many Philly students as is feasible to demonstrate a commitment to the local community.\n\n3. Many schools in the Philadelphia School District are underfunded, with only [43% of high schoolers testing as proficient in reading, and 32% in math](https://www.usnews.com/education/k12/pennsylvania/districts/philadelphia-city-sd-101796)\n\n4. Therefore, the Philly students they do take will be disproportionately from a few top schools, like Masterman.\n\nI think it's a good thing for Penn to prioritize students from the local area. That this takes the form of drawing from specific feeder schools is a side effect of a larger problem.",

But many legacies get in RD and received no preferential treatment.  Let's assume that's one-third of legacies who gained admission RD, meaning that 240 matriculated students applied and **potentially** received legacy preference.\n\nWell, we also know that a lot would have been admitted without preferential treatment, let's say half.  So, that leaves 120 matriculated students a year who would not have been here otherwise.  They were marginal and would have otherwise landed at the likes of Tulane, USC, NYU or another Ivy.\n\nAre these 120 students a year worth a heated debate?  Which elite school they attend?   I don't understand you Americans because so often you seemingly fight over scraps.  Debating how to tax your trillion-dollar companies would be more fruitful, IMHO.",

And maybe they'll get in somewhere else good. But that doesn't mean that policy should be ignored or we should just do nothing?\n\nAlso, weird false binary cuz we can debate two things at the same time. Plus they both fall under a broader debate about incentivizing those who are already at the top for, like, reasons or whatever",

And by that, I mean fuck my future children. They should have to find their own way in based on their own merits and not mine. Just like I had to.\n\nEdit: for anyone downvoting this - and assuming you're a legacy admission - you don't deserve your place in this school.\n\nLegacy admissions will end sooner rather than later. You deserve no advantage over other applicants because mommy or daddy attended Penn. And the fact that you seem to believe you do is the weakest most despicable shit I've ever heard.",

It seems so odd the only argument people have is \"it doesn't affect too many people\" as if that really correlates to whether or not the policy is a good one  And furthermore your kids will demonstrably have better odds even removing legacy policies, because of all the benefits of having an ivy league parent. So you're already passing down a huge advantage (due to the fact that most of the meritocratic stuff in our systems are broken anyway)",

                    "comment": "Hi, I'm really confused about your argument here.\n\nFirstly, what's this business about equivocating stuff? I guess there's a broader \ncontext of the supreme court equivocating legacy admissions with affirmative action policies, which I think is pretty terrible, but I'm not sure at all that's what you're talking about.\n\nSecond, I sympathize with the next part about the cruel phenomenon where the attractiveness or utility of something from which a group of people was once excluded ironically disappears when they are finally included. What comes to mind for me is the history of white people filling in public swimming pools with concrete rather than being forced to share them with Black people. That is maddening and wrong.\n\nBut by your own admission (admission ha) your children will already be privileged with an Ivy League parent. Let's set aside alumni reactions to legacy for a quick second. Abstracting from that, legacy has has nothing to do with merit, and, crucially, it's a benefit that goes to people who need it the least. According to the article, legacy can be used as a tiebreaker. Maybe removing it means future ties will break towards more disadvantaged people? So who is virtue signaling here, and how? You seem to buy that Penn is lessening advantages from legacies, even though it seems as though they're trying to do it quietly, so they're already not doing the all important \"signalling\" from this famous invective. \n\nPerhaps the change is indeed a drop in the bucket, (you say \"we don't achieve much\" so you agree we achieve some amount of good?) but that's surely better than no drop at all right??\n\nI guess it might not be better if, as you state incredibly vaguely and quickly at the end, it \"erodes the Penn alumni community,\" which comes back to the alumni reaction/\"equilibrium effect\" of the policy. But what does your erode statement even mean? Will \"wrong people\" become alumni? Or will alumni get salty that they don't have special privileges so they tank the school through lower donations and engagement? First of all, it sounds hard to truly diminish the 10s of billions in the endowment and all the centuries of academic and social prestige the school has, especially with the lack of evidence mentioned by the article that removing legacy policies hurts donations or alumni satisfaction. \n\nBut much much more importantly; isn't \"Alumni tanking the school because they get less privileges, ruining it for everyone\" the *same thing* as the swimming pools? \n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding you, but it seems the only reason to be angry about the policy is if other people are angry at the policy, or the only way it's ineffective, i.e. virtue signalling, is if other people see it as such, otherwise it just slightly increases fairness. It all sounds circular and really just like cover for wanting to keep an unfair advantage. If privileged alumni just acted like good people it'd be fine. Idk but you sound really out of touch",

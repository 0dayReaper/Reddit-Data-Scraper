    "postText": "Context: Pre-Med, Rising Sophmore Transfer\n\nI'm a prospective transfer student and I was wondering whether it was a good idea to finish up my general BIOL and CHEM sequences before transferring to PENN. At my institution, advisors recommended me to break up my sequence (taking CHEM 1 first semester, BIOL 1 second semester) and then continue into my next year (CHEM 2 in fall, BIOL 2 in spring). Since I decided to transfer, I planned on taking these courses over the summer before I transfer. Should I wait to finish these courses once I get to PENN or should I still try to take them over the summer? If I don't take these courses, I may be behind in my credits. I also worry that the curriculum may be too different between the first level of these courses at my institution and the second level of these courses at PENN. \n\nAnother dilemma: At my institution, I was placed in College Algebra and then moved on to Precalculus. So basically, I was never able to take Calculus. I was wondering if it was abnormal for sophomores at PENN to be enrolled in the Calc 1 course.\n\nI'd appreciate it if someone provided a contact that I could speak to (in case this question is too specific for Reddit). Thanks! :D",

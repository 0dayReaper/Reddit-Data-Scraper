Insurance won\u2019t cover it because of \u201cnon-emergent use of the ER\u201d. I only got a glucose test, no stomach pumps, no other scans. What do I do!? I can\u2019t pay that much money.",

However, MERT largely doesn\u2019t transport patients, that\u2019s done by PFD, which does charge a ton bc of shitty American health systems. I believe there\u2019s some arrangement in which ambulance rides may be covered by Penn for at least part of the week (Wednesday through Sunday, iirc), but you\u2019d need to check on that.\n\nGood luck, and I really hope this gets worked out!",

Someone witnessed and offered to call 911 and I said no. Few hours later a friend drove me to HUP. The physician was angry saying that I should\u2019ve come by ambulance  and that I\u2019d have to wait 2 weeks for an MRI anywhere. When asked why I didn\u2019t call 911, I told him that I had a feeling that my student insurance would cover it. As bad as it sounds, I\u2019m glad I said no \ud83d\ude23",

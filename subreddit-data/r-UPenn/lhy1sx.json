    "postText": "I'm a senior now and identify as an Asian-American man. First off, to start- My academic and pre-professional experience at Penn has been phenomenal. I was able to take classes under some of the most interesting people I have ever encountered. I co-published research. I interned abroad at a top notch lab under a Penn grant. I even took two completely unrelated classes in Nursing and Marketing! Above all, I became close with majors in my department and developed mentors and a mentee. Because of all these awesome experiences, I am confident I will be successful in my future grad school and research endeavors.\n\nNow the shitty part- I came to Penn having worked my ass off much like 99% of the school. However, as an Asian-American man going into science, I had to sacrifice a lot during high school to get to Penn because I knew very well I would have to differentiate myself in more than one way. So, when I entered I was incredibly relieved and excited to be here but unexpectedly, I had a major culture shock.\n\nThe kind of values cultivated in Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, etc households were at clash with the social expectations of an American college boy. I really struggled reconciling the two and there was almost no emotional or social help for someone like me. I was facing burnout from high school and recovering from a bad sports injury as well. CAPS and the multicultural centers and Greek life all failed me. The therapist at CAPS simply couldn't understand my issue. The multicultural centers were almost entirely dominated by a politically correct orthodoxy which didn't reach out to men in the way they did for women. And the fraternity system at Penn greatly privileged White and wealthy International students over others and I did not find anyone inside Greek life minding that at all! So, I decided to go my own way socially and joined research groups and club sports. I had a decent time and it all worked out in the end. But I have a confession: for every day for the first 3 years of college, I thought about leaving- just disappearing- because I felt no one but my family seemed to even notice me. I still sorta feel this way and I wonder if there are other Asian-American men who feel this way as well at Penn or have had a negative social experience especially in the first 2 years ?",

I can say that what you may feel is not only unique to being at Penn, although yes, maybe other institutions have a better CAPS equivalent. But outside those specific things, I can totally relate to what you wrote. Especially the culture shock. \n\nYou only get to do undergrad once, and for the most part, only live thru it at one institution. So it may feel like many things are a result of just being here at Penn. But the Greek life, the privileged kids, the feeling you\u2019re just a number in a sea of other students, the multicultural centers with sometimes ironically one-dimensional ideologies, etc. are issues at many institutions. They were at my own. And after spending time at another institution and working with many undergrads, I have seen there\u2019s very typical progression of maturity and thought processes of 18-22 college people I believe transcends time and institutions. \n\nThings like having an American identity but being raised in a different home culture is something experienced by many people over the last centuries. My mom worked so hard and sacrificed so much to get me here, but when I visit back home, there will always be a disconnect. She has not seen the interactions I have had, the opportunities I have seen, the diversity of thought processes, the formalities of academia (like what is the difference between an associate professor and a full professor, who is a dean, what do they do, how can ur department help you get a job or prepare for grad/professional school, etc.). \n\nCollege in America is a unique experience. The time from 18-22 years old is when you form your own identity, away from your home. Millions of kids go thru this every year. Sadly, this identity is further than from your own family from now on. Or at least it is for me. I am neither American white nor Asian (I don\u2019t look like a pure bred, I don\u2019t look like anything at all really lol), so I just be myself.",

                            "comment": "There's a concept in psychology called \"precarious masculinity\", where manhood has to be _earned_ through acts rather than something that you become simply by virtue of being male and over 18 years old. It takes the form of initiation rituals, formative experiences, and constant trial. In ancient times, this might've been being recruited to become a warrior or running miles across empty grassland. In modern times, men often recreate it in the form of various forms of community service, manual labor, and (in the case of some fraternities) alcoholic hazing rituals and pushup contests. \n\nOur part of American culture is one that prizes effortlessness. Consider trends ranging from \"just woke up like this\" to the feeling that everyone who talks just a _bit_ too loudly about Penn Face may secretly be working incredibly diligently under the surface in their endeavors. I'm sure you've seen people (often dudes) complain about women wearing makeup, saying that they prefer a \"natural look\" not knowing that said \"natural look\" often is actually light makeup (which takes effort!), or people who consider it impolite to have reminders to buy gifts for others around the holidays, thinking one should \"just remember who to get them for\" (again, feeling like there's something inherently wrong about the effort of writing out those reminders).\n\nNow it gets tricky, for you will feel as though manhood has to be _earned_ through your _efforts_ while inhabiting a culture that prizes _effortlessness_. If you've grown comfortably into your new role as a man instead of a boy, you'll often feel like being a man in the world is like being a fish in water-- totally natural. If you haven't grown into it yet, you'll feel strangely compelled to speak up for help but can't, because that would show your ugly, straining efforts to the world.\n\nSome will conclude that precarious masculinity is the problem, that going from a boy to a man should be given out like confetti. The reality is that this won't happen. No large institution, university-run or otherwise, will solve this for bringing boys to manhood. I'm not demanding action of anyone else, but in my eyes one of the core responsibilities of being a grown man is to lift others up as they progress through life. No multicultural organization will do that alone. There are only two options: face the uncaring void alone, or face the uncaring void alongside our brothers from another mother.",

The feeling of having to *prove* yourself to be accepted seems existentially terrifying and inherently unsatisfying--if people only value you for what you can *do*, not who you *are*, it seems like they're not actually valuing *you* at all.\n\nI wonder if it's because of my background--I grew up relatively poor, but I never got the sense that I would have to support my family or that we weren't going to make ends meet.  When people are literally *counting* on you to get by from an early age, I think I can see where this mindset might come from.  Like, if you don't make it, you're literally failing your role as a son or future husband/father.\n\nA lot of my Asian friends (particularly the dudes) have this relationship with their parents where it's not like there's any doubt that they'll be able to support their parents/their parents won't even *need* help, but there's this feeling almost like, \"We worked so hard for you, and *this* is what you do with it?\"\n\nI'm sure their parents don't actually see them as a means to an end, and their feelings are actually motivated by wanting more for their children, but it often seems to lead to unhealthy/resentful dynamics.

            "comment": " I'll DM you with some more insight but my personal experience (granted it was like 7 years ago that I graduated, so some of the culture may have changed since I was at Penn) below. TLDR It wasn't an easy time and I got lucky because I found a peer group who was able to accept and support me at the level of social I was comfortable with, but it very well could have gone wrong otherwise. \n\nI was super involved in the Asian American community on campus - ran for positions in APSC, was super involved in various multicultural groups (even outside my own ethnicity) and programs from the multicultural centers, to the point where it legitimately impacted my grades (still graduated but with a way less than stellar GPA). Didn't really get involved in Greek Life at all until my final semester when I pledged the community service frat (which many of my friends were already in), if you count that as Greek Life lol. \n\nMy first two years at Penn I didn't really partake in any drinking or partying, partly due to my strict Asian American upbringing with the idea that I was at school to set myself up for a career after college to the exclusion of all else since my parents had immigrated to this country giving up a relatively easy life in their home country and sacrificed so much for my sake. Like I remember early freshman year I had joined one preprofessional extracurricular group and they were having a welcome dinner down by 69th street (RIP Don Memos) and my parents called and freaked out when they found out I was off campus (they got better after a while). Even when the multicultural groups I was part of helped co-host downtowns or mixers with other groups, I'd go but not drink. I won't say I was a hermit per se but I definitely was not the life of the party and didn't meet the typical \"social expectations\" of American college males. \n\nI will say through my multicultural groups and some of the programs of the multicultural centers, I was fortunate enough to find peers who kind of \"got it\" and never pressured me to do stuff I wasn't comfortable in. The cultural org I was in had upperclassmen who had a reputation for being partiers, but they never made me feel uncomfortable for not drinking and supported my choices. And as they graduated and my year in that group found more members, it so happened that those in my year weren't heavy partiers and we had a more low-key approach to socializing. And the benefit of the multicultural group was that we kind of \"got it\" when it came to talking about having a shared childhood even if we were from different parts of the country - we got the pressure that our parents had been placing on us over the course of our lives and were able to have frank discussions about it - not in any formal fashion but just understanding \"yeah I get where you're coming from I've been there\" without having to explain the cultural nuances. \n\nFWIW From my perception as an alum I have seen the multicultural centers become more politically focused since I've graduated. I won't pass judgement on if that's net good or bad but I can also see how the me of 7-10 years ago who wasn't as comfortable (and still isn't fully) about talking about politics in the same tone or fervor or perspective might now feel unwelcome in that atmosphere. In my specific 4 years at Penn, I think I was able to exist somewhat apolitically - there were definitely political elements in the MC centers that I personally chose not to partake in, but in the same way I found peers who were okay with me not partying in the same way they did, fortunately my peers in the MC centers didn't quite push me to the same degree. At the same time, I definitely got most of best memories and experiences from Penn because of the MC centers.\n\nMy time at Penn definitely wasn't easy. Like I said I invested a lot of time into my extracurriculars (which I don't regret - I learned a lot of valuable soft skills wrt project management and group dynamics I apply now that I never would have learned in the classroom, esp since my individualized major didn't quite translate to a finance or management consulting role) - to the point where my senior year I completely burnt myself out after having commitments on my plate literally every weekend from August through November, and then throwing more on my plate last minute for December (again don't regret it, the last minute stuff was a series of fundraisers to help victims of a natural disaster). But by the time my spring semester rolled around I was exhausted. And since I had rolled off executive board of most of my extracurriculars in December I was suddenly feeling a lack of self worth - I realized I had tied my self worth up in my extracurriculars and being involved in the community that without those I didn't feel worth anything. Combine that with trouble finding a job while my peers did and my looming graduation where I'd have to face my parents and not have a job to show for their investment, I spiraled hard and basically failed out of two or three classes, spiraling further leading to a major mental wellness breakdown involving my friends talking to me through a locked bathroom door trying to affirm my self worth. The funny thing is at the time there was a big push in the community to use CAPS and take care of your mental wellness which I was preaching but didn't put into practice myself (tied to what I now realize was some deep seated beliefs about mental wellness from my Asian American upbringing that my parents and I have both come to terms with and moved past since then). Eventually I graduated (thanks to one of the professors of the classes I failed letting me do makeup work to raise my grade) and faced my parents. There were definitely a rough few weeks but after some episodes of literally running away from home with the intent of couch surfing and yelling matches and heart to hearts we kind of came to a realization of where their upbringing as immigrant parents impacted me and how I had perceived their intents and motivations faultily to some degree and we're in a better place now. \n\nThis has gotten long and rambly but I think it's important to share both for you and any other Asian American males out there who might be reading this.",

But the disproportionately large number of frats do privilege White students over others even when you control for family income. it is obvious, not just anecdotally, but from the statistical makeup of frats compared to the statistical makeup of Penn. In fact, for Asian-Americans or most other American PoC, the number of frats they even have a \"decent shot\" at are too few and no one tells us this until it is too late unless you have alumni connections. Anyways, I never said I didn't find a group that I identify deeply with- I continued playing my sport competitively for the Penn Club team and joined a research group which was plenty of intellectual stimulation.",

No, because it\u2019s never an issue. We haven\u2019t had to have a \u201ctalk\u201d about what\u2019s not okay to say in the house.

I never said the system was against having PoC or intolerant of other cultures... all I said was one group was preferred over all the others, and that simply doesn't sit right with my senses... maybe it's the Darwinist or competitor in me- I believe you earn your place by merit (as I did at Penn) not just by being White with an Anglican or Jewish last name",

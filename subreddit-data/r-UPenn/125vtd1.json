    "postText": "Hi! Is it recommended to double up on Physics and Chemistry? I'm a freshmen in The College and I've already fulfilled my Biology credits. \n\nI was planning on taking CHEM 1011 next semester, and then possibly starting Physics in Spring 2024. However, would this be a bad idea? Should I just take them both starting Fall?\n\nFor more background, I'm also a Neuroscience major and I plan to take some neuro course  (possibly Drugs, Brain &amp; Mind w/ Kane) next semester as well, so I didn't want to throw myself straight into the deep end.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Best!",

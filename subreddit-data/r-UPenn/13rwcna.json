Son starting grad school in the fall at Weitzman School of Design and saw it\u2019s a 26 minute walk.  We are from out of state and having difficulty finding affordable housing for a 1 bdrm non studio unit.",

Turned out we dodged a bullet, because by all reports that place was a nightmare for at least a couple years after that, while they rented out units while the building was still under construction.\n\nNo idea what it's like now, though.",

The place where i just signed a lease at is a further walk from campus, but I plan on taking the commuter rail which will make it a 15 commute to campus. The apartment building has a 1bed room available",

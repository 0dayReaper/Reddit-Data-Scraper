Because I was never super set on going here I never did much research into the culture/ common speak of students. So out of curiosity, why do so many people call it Penn rather than UPenn, to me it feels like saying Chicago, rather than UChicago. Just sounds odd \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Also comment any must-know terms associated with the school!! \n\nJust let me know what to say on campus so I don\u2019t sound dumb and uncultured \ud83d\ude2b",

We're here to expose the campus's deepest, darkest secrets. Buckle up and prepare for a wild ride through UPenn's eccentric vocabulary! \ud83c\udf93\ud83c\udfcd\ufe0f\r  \n\r  \nFirst things first: the notorious \"Penn\" enigma. Why ditch the \"U\"? Simple: we're rebels with a cause \u2013 and that cause is cutting corners on syllables. Who needs formality when we've got our Ivy League street cred?\r  \n\r  \nNow, brace yourself for a legit guide to the most peculiar (and borderline scandalous) campus terms:\r  \n\r  \nLocust Walk: A picturesque pathway designed to make students feel like they're starring in their very own indie coming-of-age film. Cinematic moments mandatory.\r  \n\r  \nQuakers: The official nickname for Penn's students and sports teams. No bonnets required, but you may receive enigmatic nods from time-traveling pilgrims.\r  \n\r  \nThe Quad: A residence hall with a top-secret initiation ritual involving Pop-Tarts and interpretive dance. Results may vary.\r  \n\r  \nPottruck: The David Pottruck Health and Fitness Center, where students go to flex their muscles, intellectual or otherwise. Nietzsche-approved workouts only.\r  \n\r  \nSmokes: Short for Smokey Joe's, a popular campus bar where students can unleash their inner James Dean or Sylvia Plath. Existential angst highly recommended.\r  \n\r  \nSPEC: The Social Planning and Events Committee, a shadowy organization with alleged connections to the Freemasons, the CIA, and the world's most exclusive karaoke clubs.\r  \n\r  \nWith this guide in hand, you'll become a true UPenn renegade, navigating the school's peculiar lingo with ironic flair. Embrace the chaos, seize your college experience by the horns, and remember: it's always sunny in Philadelphia (except when the sky is channeling its inner emo phase)! \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udda4",

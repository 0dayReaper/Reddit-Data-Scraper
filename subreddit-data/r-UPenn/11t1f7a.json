    "postText": "Hey guys, I was just accepting Into UPenn  GSE for the clinical mental health masters program and I was awarded a merit scholarship of 15k. From what I saw on the website, tuition for the whole program is 150k (135k with my scholarship) That\u2019s a lot of money!! For those of you who accepted, how are you affording this? I\u2019m curious how so many students are in this grad program with costs so high. It\u2019s truly the only reason I may not go. I\u2019m bummed because I\u2019d love the school and I\u2019ve worked so hard to get into a prestigious school but this is disheartening. Thanks to anyone who can provide some insight!",

(4k) but it beats 13k per semester. The struggle is balancing both work and grad school.... but it beats 130,000 debt.",

Unless you are going into a field where the school you went to will have a large impact on how much you get paid, I am doubtful that it\u2019s worth the stress of the debt and the opportunity cost (what you otherwise could have done with that money). In addition, when I find a specific educator that intrigues me, I often find I can learn a lot from them online- through podcasts they\u2019ve been a guest on, their books, free courses etc. Best of luck whatever you decide!",

Other programs out there are good, great even, and can get you to the same goal all without financially crippling you. $135k seems like a lot of money to become a teacher, but to go for like superintendent or principal or something then I\u2019m sure a solid argument can be made in favor of Penn",

            "comment": "I got accepted into it as well and have these same issues. The total is astronomical and I'm only getting $20K directly from Penn.  The fact is that you can probably get a full Master's education with that money and still have enough left over for books from another really good/prestigious institution and I honestly believe that there are two things we should consider when making such a huge decision:\n\n1. How is the financial strain of a program going to affect our mental health?\n2. Is the cost worth it when really (in my opinion) the only thing you're paying that much for is to say you graduated from a well-known ivy league institution?\n\nBecause at that point the prestige may not be worth it.  The opposite side of that though, is employers can be shallow and may be more likely to give someone a chance having come from a well-known university than a lesser known one all things considered and that's something else you have to take into consideration.\n\nFor me the debt is going to suck and the idea of it is crippling, but I think that as an ivy league institution, Penn may have more connections than smaller universities, and after having worked so hard and being a nontraditional student, I think I've earned the right to be here despite the anxiety the debt brings.\n\nGood luck whatever you do and make sure to take your own mental health into consideration because that is always really important!",

I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to decline because I\u2019m not sure I want to have that much in loans when in the counseling field, you don\u2019t make a lot of money up front and there\u2019s not much room for growth unless you create a private practice or get into management.",

I know for me, it was a really tough decision and what it ultimately came down to was that the professional world sucks ass and doesn't give two shakes about our mental health. They're going to care more about the name on that piece of paper because they already have preconceived notions about the big names. I fully believe (in my opinion) that that will determine the ease with which I am able to even find a job and start a career.   \n\n\nThe debt is astronomical (imo) at $151,152 for the two year program. It's absolutely disgusting. But then again, I think a decent 70% of that is just paying to say you went to UPenn and nothing more. The other 30% are for you actual education. I'm debating on the route I want to take professionally after graduating, and I am not entirely sure I want a private practice.  It's not totally outside the realm of possibility, but for now, I think I wouldn't mind taking a job making less. But I think a lot of professional careers are structured that way and you rarely make the big bucks right out of the gate. I could be wrong and a bit pessimistic. But I like to think I'm just a bit more realistic about the prospects than most people are comfortable with.",

I think really seeing the breakdown will help me see if it can help meet my future goals. I\u2019m hoping you also have an open house or some way to learn more to make your decision!",

    "postText": "hi! i'm an incoming freshman at the college studying bio (premed track) and i was invited to apply to the benjamin franklin scholars/integrated studies program (bfs/isp).\n\ni'm not 100% sure i want to go into premed, thought (i do think i will major in something stem-related); i look forward to exploring different majors/fields of study, which is why the interdisciplinary approach at bfs is exciting! the only thing i'm worried about is if i'm going to have enough space in my schedule given that isp takes up half of my freshman year schedule.\n\nif i end up doing premed, isp can make that pretty difficult, too. as far as i know, it's worse for premed students because it takes up space in your schedule that would otherwise be used to complete premed requirements, graduation requirements, etc. i've heard that a lot of premed students regret joining bfs/isp.\n\nalso, i definitely won't be the strongest academically at penn in any of my classes. on top of that, i know isp is very challenging. i'm kind of worried that my gpa is going to tank, which won't be very helpful especially if i apply to med school...\n\nsorry for the long post, but any advice is appreciated!! i know there are a lot of benefits to the program, but i'm not sure whether it's worth it. to current or ex-bfs/isp people (especially those in premed), how was your experience?",

Everyone I know who did it said they said it wasted class space and was annoying because it gave u way less freedom in ur first sem classes. I was accepted to bfs when I got in an immediately declined for this very reason (I am doing a double major so this plus isp would make things hell down the road). There isn\u2019t much upside academically or in terms of prestige that I\u2019ve seen. \n\nOnly advantage I can think of is that u get hill automatically if u do it which imo (controversial) is the best freshman dorm by far.\n\nIf you want to explore other types of classes I recommend looking through the course catalogue. I really like taking classes that in departments that specialize in a certain region (ie. REES, NELC etc). These r mostly really interesting classes and they are pretty interdisciplinary\u2014can be a combo of language, literature, film, history etc.\n\nAlso don\u2019t automatically think u won\u2019t be the strongest academically. U got in for a reason, go in with confidence!",

            "comment": "I did ISP a few years back.  Anecdotally, the premed students in my year did fine and ended up with solid placements, although it may be a bit of sample bias because my circle was pretty small and I wouldn\u2019t remember, e.g., if they may have opted to change paths earlier. My information may be slightly out of date, but here\u2019s what I remember.\n\nIt does take quite a bit of the schedule (4 credits over 2 semesters) but it also satisfies 3 of your general ed requirements so it isn\u2019t so bad as it seems. You can also choose the 3 BFS seminars in your second year onwards to knock out a few more of the requirements, so the net effect on your total courseload after 4 years should be minimal (some of the seminars count for both sector and foundational requirements, which is even better). The drawback is that it is quite front-loaded, so if you have a lot of intro courses you plan need to take in your first year, you may feel overwhelmed. But I would say that a sizeable proportion (close to half?) of the class ends up with multiple majors or degrees; it doesn\u2019t place excessive restrictions on what you\u2019re able to do in other courses.\n\nAs far as the course content goes, I very much enjoyed it. I don\u2019t think grades were an issue for anyone there \u2014 perhaps a symptom of more widespread grade inflation, but I think if you put in the work, you\u2019d get at least an A-. You essentially take 3 courses in parallel (though the workload in each isn\u2019t really up to that of a full course) and then have a lecture + discussion to compare parallels across the different topics of the week. In my day, the science stream was often a bit disjointed from the other two (I think the others were both humanities courses) but still a fun experience, and living with everybody else in the program helped create a natural community. This was probably the most valuable takeaway from the program imo. Pretty much the only friends I kept through all 4 years of college were from ISP.\n\nIf you\u2019re really interested in exploring multiple potential paths, ISP is probably one of the most efficient ways to do so (with the caveat that you don\u2019t really get to pick what the subjects are). If you\u2019re know what you want to do already, it can still be a valuable experience, but probably won\u2019t be the best fit; it\u2019s basically an interesting way to take care of a few graduation requirements without affecting your major at all. The program has evolved since I was there, but there were a number of students in my time who dropped the second semester after realizing it wasn\u2019t for them, so that may be an option as well.",

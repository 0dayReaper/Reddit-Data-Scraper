    "postText": "Hello! I am an incoming freshman and I do not know how I want to rank the housing options. I really like that Gregory offers suite style accommodations because I value privacy and clean bathrooms. However, I understand it is located in an isolated area, and is not very social. On the other hand I am interested in the quad and hill because they are known to be social. Yet, specially the quad the facilities are not good and the bathrooms not very private. Further I do not want to be in a double room. I know I want to rank Hill high on my list, but I am unsure of what to do for Gregory vs Quad. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I lived in Hill freshman year and in Gregory this past year and loved both! Hill is an almost guaranteed double, but other than that it's a great building - has a lot going on, wonderful faculty fellows, and an in-house dining hall. My hall was rather quiet which I enjoyed actually. You will likely not spend too much time in your room and I didn't mind the shoebox sized double, but lack of privacy was hard at times. The house has a new director and almost all RAs will be new next year, so I can't promise anything about the programming, but my year there were 3-4 events per week and that really helped me to socialize before I made friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGregory, if possible, has even more going on actually! When people say it's not social, I think it's more in terms of, no parties or non-residents flooding the building. Inwardly, Gregory can be very social if you go to the house events and talk to people :) I found most of my best friends through Gregory's cafe in fact, and found the residents in general more approachable than in Hill. Gregory does have a quirky vibe and it houses people who might not fit in elsewhere (maybe that's why it's so hated? a place where many typical Penn students feel a bit out of place because it's not a fit for them?). Anywho, Gregory is social in its own way. Especially now that the larger building (Gregory consists of 2 buildings) is freshmen only, I wouldn't worry about the not social part too much if Gregory otherwise seems like a good fit. No house guarantees a social life, not will living in any house preclude you from one. But Gregory, I'd say, has a slower, exist as you are vibe that's very different from most spaces at Penn. Gregory also has a very high return rate, so people who intentionally choose it tend to love it.",

It\u2019s super dirty and the food is so nasty. This isn\u2019t just my experience. Honestly, Lauder is the best place to be at. Kinda upset it\u2019s a freshman dorm now, I would live there if I could. Also, Gregory is nice too. People complain about the quad being dirty but, it\u2019s actually been cleaner than Hill this past year. Everyone I know from the Quad was talking about how nasty Hill is. Also, the Quad isn\u2019t that social. You can find just as much social opportunities anywhere you live. Do Lauder or Gregory is my advice",

            "comment": "This all depends on what you value more! Personally, you couldn't have paid me to go Quad. I value privacy (LOVED a guaranteed single, and preferred a bathroom that isn't communal/shared with more than 3 other people), cleaner facilities, and a chill atmosphere that isn't overly social. I still made friends while living there, though! There are plenty of events held there that would connect you with others. The walk from Gregory to the rest of campus isn't at all as far as people like to frame it. \n\nIn terms of the order you're looking for (or a tl;dr):\n\n1.Hill\n\n2.Gregory\n\n3.Quad\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck! :) DM me if you have any more questions about Gregory.",

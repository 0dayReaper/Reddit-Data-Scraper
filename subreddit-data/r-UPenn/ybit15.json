I'm a UPenn student who absolutely loves the food from Chez Yasmine Truck, and I was gutted to see his post recently.\n\neach order comes with a free fruit and bottle of water! the owner also remembers you and your order, and even decided his soup of the days by student requests.\n\nI sincerely hope more people will support his truck as he has banging food with a banging personality to boot. the food also definitely tasted amazing and is honestly not too expensive considering the ingredients he uses. \n\nhe doesn't have a Google maps presence (I've submitted one for him today) but he's along 3700 spruce, and I believe he closes around early afternoon.\n\ndo Google him to see articles about his truck if you're not convinced :)",

I always miss Chez Yasmine when I'm back home - you basically get a $30 entree from white dog cafe for food truck prices.",

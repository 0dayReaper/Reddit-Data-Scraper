    "postText": "I was recently admitted as a transfer to the LGIC major; however, I'm having second thoughts. I am really interested in the major, but I think I will need a few more CS classes to be hireable as a software engineer. How difficult is it to enroll in classes outside of your major? I was a CS major at my previous school, so I am almost done with the core CS curriculum. PS: I would've applied CS but, I did not have the chemistry requirement for the engineering school.",

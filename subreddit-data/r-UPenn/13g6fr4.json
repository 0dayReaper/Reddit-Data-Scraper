This is the one for student who have internships for the summer in Philadelphia. If so, how competitive is/chances of getting funded? I recently applied for the last round and am wondering what my chances are.",

It\u2019s just you get what you need(assuming that you don\u2019t earn more than 4.5k throughout the experience in which case they classify you as \u201coverfunded\u201d or sumn like that and you risk getting denied).",

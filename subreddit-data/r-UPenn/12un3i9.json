The intro sequence uses java (cross platform), and ocaml in codio (browser), major classes using C are in a vm, lots of classes use jupyter notebooks (colab), etc. The classes where it might matter would be embedded systems and maybe some of the computer graphics courses like gpu programming which uses CUDA.",

Which is why I do most of my coding on the cloud. While, I love my Mac for some of the other stuff like ease of use, and convenience, and compatibility with my iPad, I definitely think other laptops might offer way more freedom and compatibility. \n\nFor the price of a good Mac you could get your hands on a good high performance notebook with powerful GPUs as well! Something to think about, I feel. :)",

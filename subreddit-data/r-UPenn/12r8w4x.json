    "postText": "hey guys, I would really appreciate any and all honest opinions on penn and advice, especially in regards to these questions.\n\n1. Is the Huntsman Program worth it academically if I am on the fence regarding wanting to go into the financial field, especially if I am considering Stanford and UC Berkeley? \n   1.  *I am mainly interested in economic modeling and math as well as international relations and policy, which is why I love the Huntsman program, but is there opportunities for all of that at penn? or is it all very much finance finance finance focused* \n2. How competitive is the school atmosphere in your opinion, especially in comparison to berkeley or stanford? Is the community encouraging and welcoming? Are clubs and opportunities difficult to get into or are they relatively welcoming to anyone?\n3. Are internship and research opportunities easy to come by? Are most opportunities on campus or are they in the city?\n   1. *My biggest issue is that I am very much a non-city type of person and really would have a difficult time trying to navigate trains, traffic, and people just mentally so I want to know how much that would hinder me (at least at the start bc I think I should be able to slowly adapt).* \n4. How is the safety? \n\nWhat else do you wish you guys knew as prospective freshmen considering Penn? Please let me know because I would love to keep that in mind as well! *might be updating this post with more questions if I come up with any.*",

I had devlin and he was \ud83d\udd25. The material is so interesting. You don\u2019t need to know any physics or math at all. There is some math involved, like calculating gravitational force or doing a conversion formula, but it\u2019s all multiplying/dividing and you can use a calculator. Devlin curved to a B+ and on top of that he added extra points to exams.",

Very minimal math and most math is just plugging into a formula like density or something of the sort. \nI love the class and Dr. Dmochowski makes it easy to keep up (even though her syllabus might look a little intimidating). Love this class and I actually think about the things she has taught in my daily life. When I go to the beach or see rocks etc. I definitely recommend.",

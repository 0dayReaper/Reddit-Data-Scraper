I\u2019m tryna sit in on FNCE 203 just for the knowledge, but it looks like it\u2019s just a more in depth version of FNCE 100. \n\nDo I actually need to learn/know the content from 100 before trying to learn 203? \n\nOr is it something like AP Calc BC vs AB, where you could j take BC to start with?",

FNCE 100 introduces the basic tools, and 203 provides stories (so called cases) of companies and you recommend the nuances. 203 assumes the knowledge of 100. You may study 100 alongside with 203, but surely that be lot of work.",

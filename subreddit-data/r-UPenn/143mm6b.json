I work at World Cafe Live and we\u2019re holding our Beta Hi-Fi competition July 26-29 \u2013 this thing is open to ANYBODY 30 miles within Philly and is fully designed to give unknown / up-and-coming bands a chance to get their name out there! We\u2019ve got Philly scene movers and shakers judging the bands and literally hundreds of dollars worth of prizes. I\u2019ve been a musician here for almost a decade and know the struggle, I rly want everyone to seize this opportunity! There\u2019s nothing else like this in the city! Submit by Friday June 16th to be considered!!! https://forms.gle/7wRYwG4S5XjckgEr8 :)",

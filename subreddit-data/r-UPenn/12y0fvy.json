            "comment": "took a look and this is actually pretty funny. almost all of the men's and women's lacrosse players have Alexsar capital on their linkedins. i did some searching and seems like Gari Kitchen is the founder of Alexsar and he is a Penn alum. he was also a lacrosse player. and he revisits penn's lacrosse matches quite frequently. presumably he has some sort of connect with penn athletics administrator or coach or he is close with one of the current player's parents. wasn't able to figure out who exactly knows him (or maybe he knows someone who knows someone. u know how it goes). in any case, the whole thing is pretty hilarious. i think they r basically just doing a wallstreetprep online course. they're also using the same description lol. alexsar-gate",

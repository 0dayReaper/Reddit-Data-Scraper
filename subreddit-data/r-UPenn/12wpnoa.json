I am wondering if anyone could share their experience with disabilities services at Penn? \n\nIt can be the good, bad, and the ugly of your experience with them. I want to mentally prepare as I navigate the process with them soon.",

I ended up getting a copy of mine because the office here kept asking if I was sure I still had my disability (I have somewhat visible physical disabilities as well as autism) and they kept being a pain to deal with. Like yeah, I'm still autistic and my body is still pretty messed up, that isn't really changing anytime soon and a new evaluation isn't going to magically change anything.",

            "comment": "I am a current undergrad and use Weingarten myself and it's been quite frustrating using their services. I have extended time on exams and it's difficult to coordinate times and scheduling has always lead to some issue. Professors also sometimes like to \u201ctake extended time into their own hands\u201d which is even more frustrating. I am actually currently sitting on a zero for my computer science midterm as the semester closes because the professor forgot I was extended time -- I'm meeting with him to discuss this Tuesday. It will feel very inconvenient and tiresome to have to do this especially when others can simply pop into the exam normally. U just have to gut it out. Best of luck in grad school! Congrats on Penn!",

            "comment": "Congrats on Penn! \n\nI\u2019m a current grad student at Penn.Depending on your disability and program requirements, you\u2019ll need to interact with Weingarten but may also need to disclose/work with your program and research group. Weingarten is good for class accommodations and accessible transit but anything within your program (seminars, meetings, dissertation) or research group (lab space, meetings, accessible workspace) are harder for Weingarten to directly regulate. And thus communicating your access needs with your program director (if you haven\u2019t already) is super important! I\u2019ve done this with directly disclosing my disability or by just requesting the accommodations I need without naming specifics.\n\nI would also definitely recommend meeting with Weingarten early and often \u2014as soon as your pennkey is active you can request an appointment. I would also recommend getting involved and reaching out to student groups \u2014 such as the Disabled Coalition at UPenn. The student community has a TON of knowledge on how to navigate everything from testing accommodations to dissertation. \n\nGood luck!",

Yes, disability services is very mediocre, even downright bad in some cases, BUT the professors are very understanding. Even during the pandemic, it was the faculty, not admin, that was giving its students special accommodations. Please make sure your professors have a general idea of your disability in the start of every semester. In fact, the only reason this school functions is probably because of faculty not admin.",

            "comment": "5th year PhD student here. Weingarten (the student disability services center) primarily handles course accommodations such as extended exam times, etc. They also handle housing accommodations if for students who live in campus dorms. I\u2019ve found that beyond that, they are shockingly unknowledgeable and lack the ability to support students. Although I have an extended exam time accommodation for courses on file, Weingarten was unable to get that to apply to my comprehensive exams, since they weren\u2019t tied to a class I was enrolled in (but are a program requirement).  \n\nPre grad school, I was used to working with HR at my job on workplace disability accommodations. I have ADHD and autism, so sensory accommodations, like removing fluorescent lights and getting a standing desk in a private quiet space rather than in the open office layout, were critical to my functioning at work. My Weingarten counselor plays blind to everything but the course accommodations in their system\u2019s drop down list, and has repeatedly told me that Weingarten cannot support disabled students in accommodations that are not listed in their system (mainly course and housing related). This has been incredibly frustrating, so be prepared. \n\nBuild a positive relationship with your grad program chairs, committee, and admin, and advocate for yourself and the accommodations you need (be specific in asking for precisely what you need!). Document whether those requested accommodations were met , and document when they were not. While Weingarten has been useless in ensuring I get the non-course accommodations I need, I\u2019ve found that the ombudsman and the deans have been willing to send emails to anyone from my program who refuses reasonable disability accommodations I\u2019ve voiced , and this has often been an effective nudge. It\u2019s fucked that it\u2019s all on us as students to ensure our accommodations are met (rather than Weingarten). But it\u2019s not hopeless!",

What you have shared\u2014does not surprised me. \n\nI will be a part-time graduate student, so the fact I will not be on campus full-time tells me I may have a huge battle on my hands. Also, the the master\u2019s program I am in does a lot of social events, so based on what you have shared, it seems that will be the bulk of the battle in getting accommodations for social and related events to my program.\n\nAnd thank you for the tips and encouragement of me working with my program director. I may have to do that and lean on her for additional support.\n\nAlso, it seems I am not able to start the registration process with the Disability Services yet. I suspected because I was recently accepted and haven\u2019t registered for classes yet.",

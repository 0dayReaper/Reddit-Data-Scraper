As long as you know what a variable is and what a for loop is, and are at least somewhat comfortable writing a few lines of code, you're basically good. I went in with zero Java knowledge, didn't even know what a class was, and I did fine. Of course, the more programming and Java experience you have the easier the course will be, so 110 helps, but since you have significant experience in another language (Python) you're completely ready, there's no need for 110.",

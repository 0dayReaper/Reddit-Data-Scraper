I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the opportunity but wondered if students would describe it as collaborative or cut throat?

If you want to run the hospital, go to UPenn.",

Since you have a degree prior, were you eligible for any need based financial aid? This is part of my concerns, I know the accelerated program is still around same price of than but I wonder will I qualify for aid at UPenn the same as any other undergrad despite having attained a bachelors at another institution?",

Jefferson and Penn ABSNs have around a 20k cost difference so if I\u2019m in loans either way I may pick UPenn as I intend on doing CRNA at some point. As an ABSN applicant did they even ask for financial info as part of your application? I did a double major at USC and graduated May 2022. though I don\u2019t want to do physical therapy school anymore so my human bio degree kinda knocked out 99% of the pre reqs needed for nursing. But now that I have a degree perhaps loans are my only option, which I suppose is okay given the career potential.",

There are a few people who get tuition covered by an outside nurse corps scholarship, but you don't find out until after you have to commit and it's pretty competitive/has requirements for service after nursing school. I don't think it's the same as normal undergrad FA bc the program is a big moneymaker for them. I would call or email the office to ask, I'm not very aware of the process! I will say most people complain that it's too $$",

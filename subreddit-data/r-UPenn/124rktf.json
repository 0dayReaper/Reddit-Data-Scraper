Not necessarily to get away from Penn, I love the comfy little confines of Locust walk. But I also love the novelty of going to new places, passing people I don't know and will never know because we're in our own parallel worlds. Not every experience off campus is shiny and gold, there are uncomfy moments that you can't avoid, but leaving has been generally net good for my motivation and experience.",

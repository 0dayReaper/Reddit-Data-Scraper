    "postText": "Hi all! I'm an incoming grad student and I am trying to figure out Philly's rent market. I'm hoping to save on housing as much as possible without living in a dump, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what a realistic budget range is because most housing listed right now is for immediate move in or for a month or so from now. If I wanted to live in any of the standard grad student areas (Fitler, Clark Park, Graduate Hospital, etc), what would a realistic price range be for a 2-3 bedroom apartment for an August-August lease? It seems like things could be as low as $600/person in a 3 bedroom with roommates, but I don't know if they jack up prices for August leases because of the academic calendar.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all! So I recently came across this beautiful opportunity called the Quaker Consortium where Penn students can take courses at Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford and vice versa. I think this is a great opportunity that many students can take advantage of. However I have a question, when I was doing research it said that you can\u2019t take courses at the other colleges if they are taught at Penn. Is that true? Furthermore, if it is true, what courses does Penn not have (more specifically for Pre-Dental) that the other colleges do? And is it a good idea to take advantage of the consortium or simply just depend on the courses Penn offers?",

I honestly can't speak for the experience, but I've heard that the minor doesn't really prep you for the LSAT, which (rather than some minor on ur transcript) seems to be much more important for law school apps. I would engage in some LGST classes just for fun and see if you like them first. Its also an 8 credit minor which is more than most others...I have a friend studying Philosophy who got an insane LSAT score because they studied well before the exam (no lgst concentration). I'm also interested in law school--current sophomore, so I'm happy to chat about this!",

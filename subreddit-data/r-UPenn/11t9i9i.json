    "postText": "Hey all, I decided to accept admission into GSE now I wanna look for housing close to campus (within 2-3 blocks) or on campus. Affordable, will allow my animals (cat and two Guinea pigs), and won\u2019t insist I have a roommate since I want to live alone. Any good recommendations?\n\nBudget is between $1200 - $1900\n\nEdit #2: I've seen Chestnut Hall is affordable and within that range...but the reviews I read weren't stellar.",

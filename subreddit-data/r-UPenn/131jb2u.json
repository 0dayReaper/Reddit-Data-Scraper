    "postText": "I was admitted to UPenn CIS and I'm wondering if I should go (Brown or UW as other option). \n\nI heard that the CS majors super hard. Could anyone give me an idea of roughly how many hours a CS student spends on homework and studying per week, and the average GPA for CIS majors?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I debated Brown vs Penn CS asw. Penn CS will be much harder/more intense than Brown. I prob would\u2019ve liked Brown better socially. But I\u2019m glad I went here cuz it\u2019s more academically rigorous and our grad programs r significantly better\u2014u can get priority into an Penn masters or PhD, an underrated aspect of coming here if ur into that. Brown would\u2019ve been way more chill/less competitive but academically speaking I made the right decision. Go to Penn.\n\nIf ur taking the intro classes with rajiv prob 20 hrs a week. All other cs classes prob 10 hrs per week. I wouldn\u2019t not come here cuz of workload tho\u2014u just gotta survive the intro classes. Pretty much the only way u can fail is if u give up. In my biased opinion u will be better trained/smarter coming out of Penn.\n\nEdit: avg gpa prob around 3.3 idk tho",

            "comment": "CS classes on average takes 25 hours per week, besides class time, so normally 2 CS classes are taken per semester. Comparing with other SEAS majors, CS and SSE are still on the easier side. Honestly, the core classes for any majors are pretty similar across schools. The only difference is the alum, electives, culture, and location.\n\nWhat set Penn apart is the inter-disciplinary education. Many students are doing a dual degree in SEAS, WH or SAS.",

Also depends if ur taking it with rajiv.",

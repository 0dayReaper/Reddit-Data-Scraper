And what they would ask from me to be placed in it? I am afraid of doing this request in case it comes with extra costs or limitations or weird requirements. What are the benefits and the disadvantages \n? I can be a very anxious person and sometimes have expression ticks.",

            "comment": "\"Sometimes having anxiety\" is normal and does not get any accommodations. If you mean you are diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), that does count as a disability for some people but you'd need to figure out what kind of accomodations you would be seeking. You need to provide medical documentation of your disability and meet with a \"disability specialist\" to register as a student with a disability and request accomodations, but unfortunately this school has the most frustrating office to deal with out of the three universities I've had experience at. For example, I am autistic- a permanent condition- and have a permanent physical disability. It took forever to get my very simple/minor accomodations request approved last year, had to wait forever for an appointment to begin with, and now I just got a notification that my accomodations were temporary and to contact my assigned person in the disability office... which I did on Wednesday morning and haven't gotten a response yet.  I start summer classes on Monday and apparently don't have accomodations now even though nothing changed with me from a disability standpoint.  I am beyond annoyed at how pain in the butt it's been dealing with Weingarten. There are no additional fees or anything (since you asked) but at least in my experience it does give extra stress and frustration.",

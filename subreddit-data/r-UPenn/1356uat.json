Upper level coursework is not \u201charder\u201d it\u2019s more advanced but completely within reason for anyone with the proper background. Upper level coursework is also more valuable in the market",

I would love to take a bunch of very hard and interesting classes but if they all have a massive weekly homework, I'd end up learning very little from any of them. I don't know what OP's curriculum looks like but if wanting easy classes was a goal, I was demonstrating a way to do so while also learning along the way.",

There are still many ways to get good grade with little efforts, e.g. take foreign language courses which you are native.\n\nTaking more advanced course early help in your internship interviews.",

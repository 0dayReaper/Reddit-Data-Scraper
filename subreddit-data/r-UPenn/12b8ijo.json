    "postText": "Hello! I am a current hs freshman and I\u2019m really interested in applying ED to Wharton undergrad. Everything is so complicated nowadays that I have no idea what makes me a competitive applicant, so I was just wondering how I could make myself more likely to get in. Currently, my stats are:\n-4.0 gpa\n-Model UN\n-On the board of a non profit Indian youth organization that runs a 4 night summer camp for ~220 kids\n-Bronze presidential service award\n-Speech and Debate\n-Indian Student Association (club) (less active member)\n-Econ/public policy club (less active member)\n-1 AP so far (AP human geo)\n-Prob some more I forgot\n\np.s I don\u2019t really got any major awards or anything in my clubs\n\nThanks!",

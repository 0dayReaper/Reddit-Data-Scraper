    "postText": "You  can find out this Saturday (4/8) at 6pm. I'm hosting a Penn game of  Humans vs. Zombies, a zombie apocalypse simulation wherein zombies try  to infect humans (by tagging them). Humans can use nerf blasters (will  be provided, though feel free to bring your own if you have any) to  defend themselves from the zombies, but the zombies can never be  defeated, only temporarily stunned. Can you hold out against the  ever-growing horde? (Or hunt and infect the humans?)\n\nWe'll  meet at the DRL main entrance. Game should go until around 9. For more  information, or if you have any questions, feel free to DM me on reddit,  or join our discord or groupme:[https://discord.gg/8FcjPHanrG](https://discord.gg/8FcjPHanrG)[https://app.groupme.com/join\\_group/90298924/D442rAZ8](https://app.groupme.com/join_group/90298924/D442rAZ8)",

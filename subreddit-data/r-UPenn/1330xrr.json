Some even need to take classes during the summer to lower the workload in fall and spring... FNCE is not a hard major in WH (ACCT and STAT are harder), but SEAS courses varies in hours required.\n\nTalk to those in the program to assess the feasibility.",

            "comment": "Should be difficult solely due to the engineering component; with all due respect finance is one of the easier subject realms to study. I know many people who are pursuing uncoordinated dual degrees in SEAS and Wharton (or other school combos in general). However, keep in mind that engineering would remain time-consuming, so it\u2019d help to question why you want to add finance to your plate. Still, definitely doable for 4 years as long as you actually like what you are studying. An undue opinion from me: Private finance is not worth it; you\u2019re pretty much making the rich richer while slaving your life away. (I place a high value on equitable - a.k.a. anti-oppression - social impact from jobs given that we have the privilege to choose our paths and have more than our basic necessities met, unless you have quite a bit of debt.) The people who go into finance because they want to donate their salaries tend to be financially stable to begin with. If you want financial security for some time, your engineering degree alone will be more than enough.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming premed with a biology major (class of 2027). How hard is it to get good grades at upenn? I love the school and I would\u2019ve committed already if it weren\u2019t for this concern. I don\u2019t want to take gap years for medical school admissions.\n\nI\u2019m between upenn and brown for premed, schools I\u2019ve heard have very very different academic environments.",

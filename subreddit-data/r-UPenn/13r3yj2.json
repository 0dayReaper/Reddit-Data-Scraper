    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was accepted as a sophomore transfer to CAS! I'm excited, but also incredibly nervous and conflicted.\n\nI'm currently a student at Barnard. I hate being a Barnard student. I hate how Columbia College students treat us like we're not as smart, as good, or as deserving as them and that we're not \"real\" ivy league students. I love NYC, but I feel like I'm missing out on the traditional college experience (do people go to sports games, for example?). I do not feel academically challenged at or enjoy the environment of a liberal arts college. There's no real campus community and even our Greek life isn't very active. But, as a theatre person, I love being in the city though I know I'll end up in NYC post-grad for my career. Does anyone here have any insight into the on campus theatre community or community theatre in Philly? Another reason I want to leave Barnard is because the performing arts community has not been welcoming at all.\n\nSpeaking of a \"traditional college experience\", I joined a sorority that doesn't have a chapter at UPenn. What are the non-panhellenic sororities and pre-professional frats like? Are they solely resume padders or do they have similar cultures/environments to panhellenic groups? UPenn not having my sorority is one of my very few (but very strong) hesitations about leaving. I only really found community at Barnard starting in April and that was because of my sorority.\n\nAlso could someone explain the recruiting for pre-professional programs? What does this mean? I'm probably pre-law and currently planning an Anthro Archeology major but both still may change.\n\nI really, really liked the community provided by the TSO and loved the zoom open house so much today. But I'm still so worried about starting over especially when I only started to make friends at the very end of my first year at Barnard. I am SO conflicted. Can anyone give any insights, both transfer and non-transfer students? I'd appreciate it so, so much.",

            "comment": "Penn may have a stronger community through Greek life if ur into that ig but tbh Penn is a pressure cooker and it also has its drawbacks. I assume Penn will be a lot more high stress than a liberal arts college. People don\u2019t really go to sports games here so idt it\u2019s a traditional college experience in that sense. Also nyc &gt; Philly if I\u2019m being totally honest. There r pros and cons.",

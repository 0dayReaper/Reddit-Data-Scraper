Love hearing about how happy and excited you are.  Freshman year is filled with lots of changes, and the classes can be challenging,  My child is graduating this May and recently told me that he or she starting shedding tears of joy too; out of nowhere, as he or she  couldn't believe all of the things he or she did and experienced and accomplished and through it all learned, mostly happy for the opportunities gained and the friendships made. GOOD LUCK",

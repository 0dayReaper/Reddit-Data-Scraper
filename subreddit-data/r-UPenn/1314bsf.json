    "postText": "How is this class? James B. Haglund seems to be very highly rated. Also PCR says that the workload is only a 2.4-2.6, but I am presuming this is coming mostly from Math Majors. I performed well in CIS 160/121, and MATH 240, so how would I fair in the class? Is this doable with Math 314 next semester (considering a math double major)",

            "comment": "I've had Haglund for another advanced class. He's definitely a more relaxed professor and I don't think he likes to give Cs. The weird thing about Haglund is he's not a great orator (actually kind of quiet and dull lecture style), but the content of his lectures were excellent and right to the point. To this day, I remember everything I learned in his class but can't remember much of the details from the easier Calculus and Diff Eq classes.",

Haglund will prob teach it differently but the workload wasn\u2019t too bad, just weekly psets that you could finish in a day and three exams. If you haven\u2019t taken analysis yet, I\u2019d recommend 3600 before 4100 to get a better foundational understanding of math",

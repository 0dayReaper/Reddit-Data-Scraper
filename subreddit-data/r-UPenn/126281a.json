    "postText": "Hello there!\n\nI\u2019m doing an internship at UPenns Medical School this summer and I\u2019m currently looking for housing. I did find some offers on the Radian and Hamilton Court and I was wondering if anyone here can provide any insight on these options? Are these good off-campus housing places to stay at and if not, are there other recommendations? Thank you to any and everyone who can assist me with this bc I\u2019m new to housing and everything lol.",

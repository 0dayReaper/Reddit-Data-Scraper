If so, what happens if I am placed in a class below Calc I? Would I be required to take that class (1070) I think followed by Calc I?",

I don't think stats has a placement exam. If u place in a class below calc 1 it doesn't matter u can still take either math 1400 or 1070 and I think for wharton both fulfill the calc 1 requirement (not 100% sure cause they changed the system this year).",

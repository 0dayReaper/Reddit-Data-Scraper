I am an international student and have heard some stories about Philadelphia (good and bad ones).\n\nI am accepted into my dream program at Penn, seriously considering to accept the offer. Just wanna get some first-hand information from your guys. Thanks!\n\nEdit: thank you for all your replies! I have accepted the offer.",

Most of the drama you hear about Philly is not near Penn and you very quickly get a sense of what areas to avoid. The campus has gentrified a big wedge of West Philly (for better or worse).

In Boston, unless you run with the wrong crowd, the worst that will usually happen is you get mugged/jumped. I grew up in Boston and went to college there and didn\u2019t know anyone personally who had that happen to them and always felt safe walking around the city. I\u2019d say Philly is a bit different in that there\u2019s more gun violence and the drivers are wreck less so you do have to be a bit more aware of your surroundings and don\u2019t assume cars will stop at a red light. \n\nMost grad students live in one of three neighborhoods, WP/UC near Clark Park or across the river near grad hospital or center city. My neighborhood feels pretty safe and I\u2019ve never worried about my safety, though I do know two people who were mugged though that was WP/UC. \n\nPenn does have a good safety/escort/police presence and campus itself is overall pretty safe. There are areas of the city to avoid and if you do come here be sure to ask current grad students where the boundaries are. In my experience, the boundaries aren\u2019t places I would choose to live because they\u2019re simply too long of a commute for me to campus so it\u2019s not like I go out of my way to avoid some of the less safe areas.",

UC is mixed in with undergrads but might be closer to campus and I think there are a few big apartment buildings. West Philly has a more college town/suburb feel to it and you might get more space in your partner, might get a yard etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think one is necessarily better than the other, it just comes down to what you prefer. I would hate to live in WP/UC because I\u2019m from a city and love living on the city side, but I have friends who don\u2019t like living within the city and prefer West Philly.",

            "comment": "1. First semester was hell taking CIS 160 ngl. I liked the material but the workload was crazy. Second semester was great, although 121 is also very hard. Kinda depends on the other classes ur taking. That being said u will def learn a ton and become much much smarter. Penn CS esp w/ Rajiv is intenensely math-based and it'll give u a really solid foundation. Ur math ability will increase dramatically which helps for whatever field u go to.\n2. No, at least for the intro classes. You will pull all-nighters. I'd say the vast majority of Penn students would not be able to handle the workload in the Rajiv CS sequence. It takes a lot of dedication and u will be working most of the time. Idk what schools u r deciding between but Penn CS will be similar in workload and difficulty to like UCB, just our grading is prob more generous. From what I've seen our CS is def on the harder side compared to other ivies. For this reason, u should only do CS here if u geuinenly enjoy it. Otherwise, I feel like I would not have survived.\n3. Depends on ur prior experience and if u stick with it/don't give up on assingments. It will take a considerable amount of hardwork.\n4. CS at Penn is very hard, but the profs/TAs r generally very helpful/encouraging. The only way u will fail is if u completely give up.\n   1. Don't worry about bad grades because u will get a lot of them (I'm talking &lt;50% a lot of the time). If u r struggling in the class, literally camp out in office hours.\n   2. Also, CS takes a very different type of studying. To do well on the exams, you will need to look up questions online/in textbooks to almost \"guess\" what will come up on the test since the exams r a time crunch and the questions r very hard. If u r able to recognize even a few questions on the test u can get median since the avgs r very low usually.\n   3. CS is a competitive bunch. Most people will be smarter than u. Some people will stress u out every time u talk to them. Don't get imposter syndrome. Being around the mean in CS is very good.\n   4. It will feel like u r failing for the entire semester until like the very end.\n   5. There is a no collaboration policy for a lot of the classes. This is very annoying and even tho people do collaborate anyway it creates kinda competitive atmosphere.\n   6. Penn CS is more math/theory-intensive than programming intensive compared to other schools. That being said, we do have a lot of practical classes asw. Tbh u really get the best of both world here. If ur more of a math-person who isn't as interested in the programming side of things, Penn is a great fit. If ur just interested in learning how to code/swe, a place like Cornell might be better?\n   7. Professors and course quality r generally very good. I have heard very few complaints in this regard. It isn't like UCB where there r like 2k students in a class and the profs dont know who tf u r. The profs will sit with u 1 on 1 to help out if need be.\n   8. You are much more likely to do well if you come in with prior experience in discrete math/coding. That being said, you can still do well wihtout these things--if u don't have experience, take the slowest sequence, no need to load up on classes so fast.\n   9. The accelerated masters program is a great deal and a lot of people do it.\n\nEDIT: I assume u r comparing w/ CMU. Similar in terms of workload for the intro classes. After that, Penn CS is prob a little more chill (relatively lol). I know lots who took Penn over CMU cuz they have other interests outside of CS. If u r only CS focused I'd go CMU. Otherwise, I'd go Penn.",

                    "comment": "wow-thanks so much for the response. the only thing holding me back abt penn cs is im kinda scared of the grind and being worried that the only way ill be able to keep up is with immense time sacrifices, leaving me to do nothing but work at college basically. \n\nat cmu im in for data science and it seems to be a LOT more reasonable than cs here in terms of workload. there are less hard classes and they are very well spread out, and my major allows me to plan with lots of flexibility. to add, a lot of the kids there in my major that I talked to have ample time to do other things like ECs and seem genuinely content with their time. penn cs i just dont get that vibe at all, correct me if im wrong tho.\n\ni also dont have an amazing background in cs (soph yr 4 on apcsa and i forget almost all of it) or discrete math (im doing calc bc this yr and have never done like proofs or math based comps) so im esp worried abt some of the theory classes. for my major, at cmu, there's much less of these from what i can tell.\n\ni would love to hear ur thoughts on my apprehensions abt penn cs and if they r valid or maybe slightly an overreaction. past that, last questions i have:\n\n1. if im not on track to do cis 160 with rajiv (with [this](https://advising.cis.upenn.edu/assets/images/csci-start1100.svg) schedule for example), is that gonna be an easier workload or harder or what\n2. is the no collab policy strongly enforced?\n3. what do u think is the average amount i'd work on studying+classwork a day or week?\n\nthanks again for ur input :)",

                            "comment": "Feel free to dm as this thread is getting kinda long.\n\nIf it isn't CMU CS then UPenn is the obvious choice, there really isn't a decision here lol.\n\nDon't be scared of working a lot/taking difficult classes! This is the only way you improve at something and it is the reason you are at an ivy league school. Tbh the ivies arent worth it if u arent gonna put in max effort.\n\nI did not have any discrete or competitive math background--I have a much stronger calc background but this was useless for this sorta classes. Tbh I struggled in Rajiv's classes but my grades ended up alright (in the B+ range). I have my 121 final monday lol. Woudlve done a lot better if I knew how to study for his kind of tests from the beginning tho. I had a decent programming background tho which allowed me to go faster trough the programming hwks in 120/121.\n\n1. If you don't do it with rajiv (the schedule u sent) it is significantly easier but you will be less prepared1 (I think?) for the upper division classes. A lot of people who take it with rajiv have prior expereince in math comps/discrete and are CS majors so the competition is stiff. He also gives a lot more work (ie. 2 psets a week for 160). Basically rajiv will kill you with work but by the end you become extremely good at math and all ur other STEM classes seem easier (at least for me).\n2. The first 1/2 of 160 there is no collaboration. Second half of 160 and 121 there is collaboration with max 2 other people (can only discuss approaches). They will give a lot of empty threats. Just never share ur latex or code with anyone and u won't get accused for anything (they have p good plagarism checkers for code). Tbh they help u enough in OH that breaking the rules isn't necessary to do well. You just have to wait in the queue for a while lol. This doen't apply if u don't take it with rajiv as the other prof's collab policy is a lot looser. Tbh what caused me the most stress was not the hwk, but it was the exams. I would be way above avg on all the hwks then nuke the exams (like &lt;40% :( lol). The exams r super long and nobody really finishes the test.\n3. Really depends on how good you are at the classes. I was pretty average at them. If you do 120+160 at the same time 1st semster with ur background, maybe 30-40 hours a week on CS? Again it will be a lot more painful if u don't actually like CS. I really enjoyed the material in general so that is how I survived. In a rajiv class, the day the psets were due for 160 and weekends for 121 ur working like the entire day. There are only 2 midterms and a final tho. Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays I had most of the day free. So basically grind for 4 days, relax 3 days. Twoards the end it was painful tho. 121 isn't as bad, only a few all nighters--but I am also taking easier classes alongside it. My freinds in 160 without rajiv aren't working so much on 160 but if u don't take it with rajiv u also are behind the other kids so u usually have to take more classes at once = more work down the road if that makes sense. I am also doing a double major Econ/CS (like many Penn students) so I wanted to get the CS reqs out of the way early before Econ ramps up.\n\nSo basically, you won't be able to go out like every other day, but there are a few days where u can relax granted u dont have many other commitments. Tbh i don't think CMU will have less work anywhow.",

            "comment": "We all have different definitions of \"enjoyable, valuable, attainable, good amount of time\" etc so I'll just tell you what I have felt so far and I have completed my freshman year so far so keep that in mind. I'm not someone who has gone through all 4 years but I have met countless CS majors from all years and this is what I have gathered (according to my definition of those words) \n\n1- time at Penn is valuable and can be enjoyable if you don't constantly live in imposter syndrome and are not stressed or guilty of not doing enough. You will make so many memories in college wherever you go so it is definitely going to be memorable. \n\n2- No, I did not think I could relax a reasonable amount but again That's based on so many factors that we may not have in common. \n\n3- average GPA at Penn engineering is below 3.5 so I would not say attaining an above 3.5 is easy. Classes definitely take so much time here hence my answer in #2. \n\n4- come to Penn knowing you will be challenged and don't let that beat you down and discourage you when you start to feel average but that is easier said than done. But hey some have a harder time while others have a relatively less harder time.  Nevertheless we all grow and we all learn here.",

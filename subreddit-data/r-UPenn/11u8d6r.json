            "comment": "So in context, I took stat 1110, and my friend took biol 2510. Content-wise, it literally *almost* the same exact thing. It's just that biol 2510 has more analysis on bio context/scenarios while stat 1110 is more generalized in terms of scenario (business, bio, health, etc.). However, the actual data analysis, interpretation, and testing you will learn are the same.\n\nMy personal opinion is take stat 1110 because (1) more forgiving in grading since stat 1110 is not just exam based, but homework and participation points as well and (2) I like the environment (which could be a bit biased).\n\nIf ajazi is still teaching, take her. I really liked her style. Lots of examples, practice problems, and very, very straightforward exams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: i dont think the course itself matters for premed since u learn the exact same thing lol. its just gonna look different on your transcript, which i highly doubt the admission will care if u took a bio or generalized stats course.",

            "comment": "I took the grad version of statistics for biologists. Same course, we just had to do extra work. I personally hated that class- the TAs were not very helpful, there wasn't much partial credit on the tests, and to me the weekly homework was pretty challenging and took a long time. Granted, grad students had to do \"bonus problems\" that we weren't taught how to do in class so that took up probably half my homework time. However, the (pre med) undergrads in my lab took it the previous year and thought it was a good class; the main reason I took it was because one of them recommended it. From what I've seen, the material seems to be about the same between STAT 1110 and BIOL 2510 so you could probably just go with whatever one fits your schedule best.",

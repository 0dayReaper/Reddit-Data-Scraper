            "comment": "The first part of the course introduces basic UI/UX concepts, and was very straightforward. Classes were slide-based and the professor would ask questions or run activities (building paper prototypes, user interviews, etc). The homework assignments were project based (as mentioned by the other comment) and sometimes had coding. TAs were always accessible. The second part was research based, where you'd be split into groups and assigned a research paper to read and present to the class on. The homework during this time was discussion threads. There's a final project that runs semester-long, where you and your team choose an area of HCI you're interested in and design an experiment, conduct trials, and present findings of.   \n\n\nOverall I'd say the course is fairly simple in that if you regularly attend class (participation points) and do all the assignments you'd likely get an A or A-. Often it's completion grades. During the discussion posts, the students presenting on the study would grade your responses, so part of your grade depends on your peers. I personally felt the class demanded a little bit too much time (conducting research trials in person, busting out a web app, reading papers, etc.) but if you're familiar with these types of assignments then you'd get by much faster. I personally read research papers pretty slowly, and they assigned 2 per week with some being up to 10 pages.  \n\n\nI took UI/UX under the Design department, so what stood out to me were the other applications of HCI in research. The crash course web app assignment was fun but as a CS major, it's much more simple than anything I'd have to work on. I know last semester when Prof. Metaxa wasn't teaching the course, it was project-based with much less research. I think Prof. Metaxa will likely adjust their syllabus to accommodate for this, but just my speculation!",

            "comment": "Prior to getting it's sparkling new course code as CIS 4120, the course was listed under CIS 3990/7000 Special Topics. (Check if course review has anything there?)\n\nYou can reference the syllabus from last semester (although taught by a different professor): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fPKdiA33jGlUTg6-nCpXovWq1N-QOgqZWQ9qFYcRnHc\n\nFrom my experience, the class is rather project heavy so it's really up to you on how much work you plan to put into the course. There were also several programming assignments scattered throughout the semester so those who had web development experience (in HTML/CSS/JS) found the coursework easier.",

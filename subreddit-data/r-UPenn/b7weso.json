    "postText": "Congratulations! You did it! \nIf you're eager to learn more about Penn, here are some words of advice for the Penn Class of '23 from a current Penn freshman. \n\n**Put yourself out there.**\n\nNew Student Orientation (NSO) is when everyone is looking to make friends. Try to balance between making quality vs. quantity friends. For me personally, I knew most of my high school class since elementary or middle school, so I really put a lot of effort (especially as an introvert) on being able to make new friends in college. This is the chance to forget all the dumb mistakes and embarassing moments from high school. You don't have to be the same person that you used to be, so put yourself out there. These could be the last four years where you'll be in the same space as a large number of your peers where people are open to making new connections and learning from each other. \n\n**Develop time management skills.**\n\nThere are so many things going on all the time on campus. You will likely need to devote some time to learn how to use Google Calendar and an agenda/planner or some organizational system if you don't already. If you got by without being very organized in high school, I can guarantee that it's much harder to do in college. \nI'd recommend scheduling the important activities in your life first: sleep, eating, being active, and having time for yourself. These are my priorities because if I don't take care of myself, my mental and physical health both go to shit and I can't get anything done. \n\nStop procrastinating. Try to start your homework as soon as possible. One strategy I learned was to schedule time in between your classes to do homework so you don't waste too much time doing nothing. Another I learned was to set a cutoff period of time: work as hard as you can until, for example, 9 PM, and then just cut yourself off from work and chill with your friends. This helps you avoid burnout. Also, it's much harder to break a cycle of being behind in college. If you start strong, it's much more likely that you'll end strong. \n\n**Consider what you want from college.**\n\nI decided that I wanted to grow in a number of different ways. For me, I was finally able to accomplish a lot of goals that I had for a long time, but never pursued previously. I think I learned somewhere that with big life changes, you're more likely to be able to form new habits than on a daily basis. I started lifting (7AM Pottruck, anyone?), eating healthier, became more organized, got more sleep, and procrastinated less. \nPersonally, I want to learn more about myself and the world. \n\n**Figure out a *tentative* four year plan by the end of your first year.**\n\nThis is especially important if you want to study abroad or do multiple majors/concentrations/minor! Although it is a bit much to plan out all four years of your college within the first 25%, I believe that it's important to do a tentative plan so that you can research the requirements and understand what you really need to take. Consider what classes can count for multiple requirements. Some schools use RateMyProfessor, but we have PennCourseSearch and PennCourseReview (the latter requires PennKey access, I forget about the former). \nIf you're in a special program (M&amp;T/Huntsman/BFS), there will be specific requirements for your curriculum, and it's important that you get started as soon as possible to fulfill these requirements.\n\nYour advisor will help you register for classes! We have this thing called \"Advance Registration\", where within a two week period, as long as you have your requests in by the end of the period, your requests will be submitted. After advance registration ends, an algorithm will determine what classes everyone will take based on everyone's requests and how everyone ranks their preferences. Schedules will be available for view a couple weeks or so after the end of Advance Registration. If you don't get into your classes, use PennCourseNotify; it will email you when someone drops the class! \n\n**You don't have to go into consulting or finance.**\n\nYes, a LOT of Penn students do, so it is feasible. But if you don't give a shit about consulting or finance, don't do it just because everyone else is. Find something you're actually interested in so that you don't have to suffer learning and doing things you don't actually care about. Penn is such a great institution and there's so much more to learn than consulting or finance. \n\n**Figure out what your limits are.**\n\nIf you're not sure if you want to drink or do drugs when you get to Penn, I'd recommend making the decision before you come to campus. If you say no, stick with it. You can still have fun, but the odds of you having fun at parties are significantly lower, and that's completely okay. \n\nIf you say yes, please have tried these things in a safe environment and know what your limits are. Count your drinks. Be careful about who you accept your drinks from. Don't do anything too stupid. It's not fun waking up in the hospital having blacked out and gotten MERTed (Medical Emergency Response Team). \n\n**Get the Penn Mobile App when you get to campus.**\n\nIt tells you what washers and dryers are available, what dining halls are open, and lets you book group study rooms. I'm sure there are more functions, but these are the most important/useful ones. During NSO, dining halls' schedules are subject to change and may not be reflected on the app, so be wary of that. \n\n**College shopping list with miscellaneous advice:**\n\nInvest in good waterproof shoes and an umbrella, and keep the umbrella in your backpack. (Check the weather daily.)\n\nAcetominophen/Ibuprofen, thermometer, cough drops: you will likely get sick. If you don't have meds and your friends don't either/are busy, it will be treacherous to walk all the way to CVS when your limbs feel like they're going to fall off your body. \n\nGet a warm winter jacket: it doesn't have to be Canada Goose or Moncler. \n\nLearn to layer: invest in thermals. I recommend Uniqlo Heattech-- super lightweight and very warm. \n\n**Don't necessarily listen to everyone who says to get the dining plan with the most dining dollars.**\n\nThis is an unpopular opinion, but if you want to eat three meals a day, I recommend getting the dining plan with the most swipes. Yes, you'll have to sit down and it's not convenient if you have many back-to-back classes around lunch time (Hill just introduced continuous service though, so this isn't really an argument anymore anyway), but nothing's better than being able to eat until you're full and not worry about how many dining dollars you have left. If you really don't have time to sit down in the dining halls and eat, you can also get a to-go container. \nHill and New College House (NCH) and Hillel are the best dining halls, hands down. They have healthy options that still taste good. Mclelland is convenient for breakfast and late-night, but their food is slightly questionable. Only very slightly. Anyone who talks mad shit about Mclelland breakfast has probably never actually eaten breakfast at Mclelland. \n\n**Don't be afraid to ask for help.**\n\nPenn is going to challenge you in many ways, and that's perfectly okay. Don't forget that Penn is an institution with all the resources it has. CAPS, your advisor(s), your RA/GA, and your friends! CAPS has a bad reputation. But if you need someone to talk to or are just going through some things, I'd HIGHLY recommend going to CAPS. Also, be real with your friends; they want to help! Don't be afraid to talk to friends from home; they're probably going through similar things. And if they're not, then that doesn't mean that they aren't willing to listen. \n\n**Consider your mindset.**\n\nNo matter what happens, it's ok. Having resilience is much more important than being successful at first. Eventually everyone is going to have setbacks, and if you're resilient, then you can get through anything. Accept that shit happens. It's okay. \n\nGrades aren't everything. Don't take them too seriously. They aren't everything.   \n\nYour mindset is a large determining factor in your success. Know that things will be okay and that you can keep moving forward. \n\n**Enjoy the rest of your senior year and your summer!**\n\nIt only comes once!\n\nBest of luck! :) Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or just want to talk about Penn.

Take the first year to explore, but if you will explore beyond first year, definitely keep in mind the sector/liberal arts requirements along the way by doing @ least one a semester to stay on track for graduation.\n\nAnd please be sure to ask other, older Penn students and Penn redditors for course recommendations, best professors, classes to avoid, etc. Don't settle for less, make sure you get the best professors for the courses you take, especially the large lecture ones (Ex. Prof. Nakia Rimmer for math courses).",

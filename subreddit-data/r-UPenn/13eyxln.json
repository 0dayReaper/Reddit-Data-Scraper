The website doesn\u2019t offer much information about what kind of activities they do during the two programs, so is there anyone who has participated in either and can tell me about their experience?",

Great experience and tbh I think I would\u2019ve hated freshman year without it cuz orientation was super overwhelming.\n\nBasically u go on a backpacking trip for four days with a small group and hang out a camp site. Lots of different activities they will keep u busy every second of it.",

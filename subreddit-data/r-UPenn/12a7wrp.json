            "comment": "Quaker days were a big part of why I chose Penn, and I highly recommend making time to go them rather than doing a standard tour. \n\nDuring Quaker days, not only do you get to walk around campus/get the Penn-approved tour info, but you also get to meet a lot of your potential classmates. \n\nWhen I was first deciding on a school, I was more concerned about the \u201ccampus vibes\u201d than meeting my peers. I honestly didn\u2019t think that getting to know my potential future classmates mattered as much as what campus looked like, school resources, and the prestige of the program. However, when it came down to it, the experiences I had meeting other admitted students was a big part of why I chose Penn.\n\nThis is also true of other admitted students events! I was able to go to admitted students days at not only Penn but also UCLA, UCSD, and Brown. All of the campuses were beautiful (especially in spring with all of the flowers in bloom) and the programs, while different, all brought something desirable to the table. This I could have learned from a simple campus/program specific tour. When choosing between these schools, I found that my experiences at admitted students days were the reason why I gravitated towards UCLA and Penn more than my other options. This is not to say it was the deciding factor, but it helped a lot in narrowing down my options.\n\nAll of this being said, the people you meet at Quaker days won\u2019t necessarily end up at Penn/in your future friend group. Moreover, if you don\u2019t connect with people at Quaker days, it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be able to find a wonderful community for yourself at penn. It just provides a more holistic view of \u201cwhat you\u2019re getting yourself into\u201d and helps you to imagine what the next 4 years will be like and who you will be spending them with.",

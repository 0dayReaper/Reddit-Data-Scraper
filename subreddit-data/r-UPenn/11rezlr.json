    "postText": "I'm thinking about taking MATH 2400 over the summer (Currently in MATH 1410 and it is going fine overall). I was aiming to take MATH 2400 in the first summer session so that it would be online for 2 hours at night MTWH. I am working remotely this summer and would not be aiming to take any other summer classes. I want to know how feasible this is/ If anyone has taken MATH 2400 or any math course in the summer. Does it follow the same quiz setup? How do they structure it if it is online?",

            "comment": "I took MATH2400 online over the summer last year, and we had a (asynchronous) midterm and final, and 5 homeworks. There were pre-lecture quizzes based on the videos as well, but if I remember correctly we had two attempts on those and they were worth a very small percentage of the grade",

I was working full-time during that summer and the one before when I took MATH104 and MATH114 (not sure what the numbers for those are now, sorry), and I could manage as long as I was being intentional in doing homework problems/studying consistently instead of right before the exam.\n\nI also think the exams were fair, and the professor did give us a time limit (90min for the midterm and 120min for the final once you start the canvas quiz) so it wasn\u2019t designed to be a 24h exam or anything like that, but I appreciated the flexibility to take it when it was most convenient for me. He also gave us plenty of practice problems beforehand\n\nPS: My Professor was Davi Maximo (he is great)",

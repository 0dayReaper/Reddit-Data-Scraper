As students, you get discounted shipping through [Pennship](https://mail.business-services.upenn.edu/external-mail/express-shipping/personalship-discounts) but lately I\u2019ve found [Pirateship](https://www.pirateship.com) just as good and more choices.",

I\u2019m honestly not worried about the costs since it\u2019s just a box or two, I\u2019ve just had multiple horrible experiences with the mail the past couple months and I\u2019m trying to find someone to help so I don\u2019t have to be anxious for multiple days as it reaches there, but I\u2019ll look into insurance",

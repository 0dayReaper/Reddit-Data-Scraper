    "postText": "I'm a mechanical engineering freshman for the upcoming year, and I'm trying to figure out a laptop to get as I haven't seen any recent posts that are relevant to me. I'd much prefer a Macbook as it works conveniently with my other devices and I'm used to it (+battery life and m2 makes it speedy for its weight)(and it works well with the software i use for personal projects (blender)), but windows is definitely an option. I'm just mainly concerned with the software I'd need to run (like solidworks for example), and whether or not they're too heavy to run on Parallels desktop. I was also considering getting a macbook to use for general heavy work and a smaller cheaper headless windows computer, using the macbook as a monitor when i need to run windows-only software, though it seems like a sub-par solution. What do y'alls think?",

Am aware that career will use windows as well - I have a windows desktop with a Linux VM that I use for robotics stuff. My main reason for a Mac is cause I have an iPad + iPhone and by god airdrop is so convenient. I also use Blender and fusion 360 a lot, and apple silicon updates makes blender render pretty fast. I also am looking for a laptop that I can run heavier software on, and don\u2019t really want to get a heavy gaming laptop that has such a short battery life that I\u2019ll have to plug in to use anyways.",

            "comment": "An often overlooked aspect of laptops is upgradability. Even simple things like adding RAM or swapping out the SSD are a pain on a Macbook. For someone who plans on using heavier software, and assumably wants to use the same machine for several years, a different manufacturer is likely the better choice. I\u2019d recommend finding several models that fit your current spec needs and googling to compare their repairability and upgradability.  \n\nPersonally I also prefer to install a better OS than Windows, as a dual-boot if necessary, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing that if you\u2019re fine with Windows and aren\u2019t familiar with Linux and installing an OS.",

Technically yes you can use through remote desktop but it\u2019s not super reliable and it\u2019s much better to have it running on your own machine. Be sure to get one with plenty of storage because solidworks alone takes up about 25 GB for just the installation",

            "comment": "I have a 2016 MacBook Pro 13\u201d with an i5 and 8gb of ram and it\u2019s honestly the perfect computer. Aside from needing adaptors for everything bc it only has USB-C ports, it\u2019s really nice cuz I can do usual work and whatnot on MacOS which makes things a lot more efficient because I can airdrop from my phone (or iPad if I had one), and then I can switch to Windows with bootcamp and do solidworks whenever I need to. It can run solidworks perfectly fine and only starts to slow down for really big assembly files. \n\nMy suggestion would be to either get a certified refurbished intel MacBook Pro if you have money to spend or get a used one on eBay if you\u2019re trying to save. \n\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t go for the headless setup like you mentioned because Penn already allows 24/7 access to remote PCs and they have much better specs for CAD than most people will want to spend money on. However I would consider getting maybe an m1 MacBook Air and a separate desktop if you wanna do some occasional gaming or rendering.\n\nHope this helped!\n\nEdit: \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Retina-Display-Six-Core/dp/B09X68DHM1/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=1QNS5LDB6FJIV&amp;keywords=2020%2Bintel%2Bmacbook%2Bpro&amp;qid=1681863570&amp;sprefix=2020%2Bintel%2Bmacbook%2Bpro%2Caps%2C80&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFRUU0wTzZBVVZNOEMmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxNjk1ODkzNldZTlYzVzlOSENMJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwOTcwMDExS1ZSWk9GVTE0N1Emd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl&amp;th=1\n\n^ this looks like an incredible deal",

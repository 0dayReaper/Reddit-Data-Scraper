All this blackmail to sign NDAs and to put her in jail from the highest offices of Penn, just because media misrepresented herself as fgli from birth, and because Fierceton might have unknowingly benefited from this in her Rhodes scholarship application? \n\n  \nobviously we can't have a perfectly unbiased opinion at this point without reading her entire Rhodes application, but I find it extremely hard to believe Penn officials will target a student so maliciously just because a student was 'exaggerating her resume'. \n\n  \nPenn's statement in court focusing on all the detailed suburban life that Fierceton had prior to foster care and denying all the faults about their emergency protocol that recently led to a death of another student... i think its 100% clear penn has an agenda to bury Fierceton alive. this is screwed up.",

With the callous way Penn talks to their students about everything (cough innate talents cough), hearing that they have taken it a step further to legitimate malice is sadly unsurprising. The fact that they wanted her to sign an NDA and agreement to not sue makes me think that they were afraid she would win and knew they were in the wrong.\n\nEdit (because I\u2019m still so upset): this is one of the reasons why children who suffer abuse (and victims of violent crimes) don\u2019t speak up. At every step of the way they are questioned, forced to relive their trauma, and not believed. Did Mackenzie maybe exaggerate on her essays? Sure, but it\u2019s her narrative told from her memories as a child in pain and in my opinion understandable. All these statements from Penn that she didn\u2019t \u201cactually\u201d suffer severe injuries, she spent 3 weeks in the hospital. You don\u2019t spend 3 weeks in the hospital for something that\u2019s not severe. Moreover, people so often overlook that doctors and \u201cprofessionals\u201d are perpetrators of domestic abuse, no matter how clean their record is. I\u2019m so angry on Mackenzie\u2019s behalf and hope she gets the justice she deserves.",

They took issue with the fact that she said she was at her sixth home when the foster care system only documented five. Her explanation was that she did a university summer program and lived in the dorm (Penn doesn\u2019t accept this as a new living situation). She also couch surfed with friends which is typical of foster youth that age. If anything, she played down her experience. Also, when have they ever scrutinized other kids entrance essays? Have they ever investigated a Manhattan private school app essay to see how involved students actually were in their clubs and community service? Or is this investigation reserved for survivors and former foster youth who want to help other foster kids? They freaking made her produce pictures of delivering a baby bc they accused her of lying about being a doula. They were so obviously on a predetermined mission, digging for anything they could find to take her down. \n\nThe questioning of her abuse on its own is enough to warrant firing every admin involved. Mackenzie submitted mountains of evidence of her abuse. She had medical records, police reports, witness statements from detectives, nurses, lawyers, teachers, and friends, and contemporaneous childhood journals. Pause to reflect on the fact that Penn forced her to dredge up this evidence to \u201cprove\u201d that she suffered horrific abuse under threat of criminal charges for fraud and rescission of her degrees and coveted Rhodes scholarship. She had all of this evidence only because of the duration and severity of the abuse she suffered. I also suffered from domestic child abuse and have no evidence to offer. It was never bad enough to go to the hospital. I had journals but the abuser destroyed them. My abuser denies it happened. So I guess according to Penn, it never did. I\u2019d like to know which survivors they WOULD believe? How much evidence is enough for them? Do they know anything about how abuse works? \n\nThe claim that she lied about income status is equally frustrating. FGLI\u2014 first generation and/or low-income. As a financially independent foster youth, estranged from her bio family, Mackenzie indisputably met the FGLI definition as intended by the FGLI community. The audacity of Penn to argue that financially independent, low-income foster kids should be disqualified from financial assistance if their estranged bio family/abusers wouldn\u2019t qualify for financial assistance is infuriating! They are almost explicitly arguing she didn\u2019t deserve to go to Penn because her abuser was a well off radiologist who could afford to take Mackenzie horseback riding before Mackenzie was removed from her home by the government and became a ward of the state. It\u2019s so obviously disingenuous.\n\nI am holding out hope that the courts see what the public sees\u2014 a blatant attempt to discredit a key witness in a wrongful death lawsuit by any means possible. I think it\u2019s a good sign only trash publications (NYpost, USA Today, and Newsweek) picked up the Penn narrative. Their PR team no doubt pitched and were turned down by more credible/critical publications. \n\nAll around devastating indictment on UPenn and Rhodes. Not many people could fight back the way Mackenzie has and as a survivor I\u2019m so grateful to her for holding these monsters accountable so they think twice about treating others like this in the future.",

I can't find much in the way of material misrepresentations.\n\nEssentially, she probably exaggerated the extent to which she provides funds for her sister when she filled out financial aid forms. It's hard to say because it seems she is estranged from Ms. Shaw, her stepmother.  It seems like her father gave her some of the money for the 529 for her and she instead set it up for her sister and then made regular contributions. She contributed financially in other ways at times, but this was probably the main way.  Penn's own report on this indicates that she might have more evidence of support but they didn't investigate any further. I kind of wonder if she had been trying to get her sister to move in with her, but that's just speculation based on the very toxic family environment (her stepmom seemed to be less than truthful in other ways, see below).\n\nAlso, she was involved in a non-profit her stepmom helped start out. According to Penn, Ms. Shaw, her stepmom, said Fierceton basically did nothing. But then Fierceton provided Penn with evidence of her involvement and her work (which makes me question the stepmom in general). But the gist is, they aren't saying she misrepresented her work (their report states she was enthusiastically involved in many aspects). All they are saying is that she gave herself a title when the non-profit gave her no official title. The titles she used in applications were \"Volunteer Lead Advisor\" and \"Volunteer Deputy Director.\" I mean... advisors commonly tell students to put a title on their resume and, if they don't know what their title was or don't have one, put something down that demonstrates your involvement. These titles might have been exaggerations but, honestly, it seems weird to focus on this given that it's pretty common practice on resume applications to create a title to illustrate your role. Moreover, it's odd that Penn would be so hung up on the fact that she put down a title when it concedes she did the work.\n\nAnd that's... pretty much it. Everything else was either Penn not having a clear definition of FGLI and blaming her for not figuring out the one they would eventually come up with, or other people (including Penn) mischaracterizing her youth--not because she said anything to that effect-- and the fact that didn't correct every journalist who did this, like she's got an effing press office or something. Hell, most of the mischaracterizations were based on Penn's language and not hers, so unless they are arguing that she should have divined what information they were sending out to her recommenders or been responsible for their website, I don't see how they can blame her for that.",

I read the Rhodes report (and Penn's report). It was surprising how much it didn't support their conclusions.\n\nFirst, they messed up in some places, saying she lied about her sister because she's an only child. She's not--even the Penn report was like \"yeah, Rhodes got that wrong.\"\n\nSecond, they say she lied about the number of times she was a ward of the state because at one point she says \"I was once again a ward of the state.\" She had had some involvement with CPS in connecticut and a guardian as litem was appointed for her. This doesn't technically make her a ward of the state when she was younger, but damn if it isn't splitting hairs on a teenager's use of the words \"once again\" when relaying a traumatic experience. Like, if a teenager was telling you and your friend a story about how hard it was arriving at a foster home and they said \"I got to my foster home--once again I was a ward of the state\" and your friend butted in with \"Um, so actually you previously had a guardian ad litem, so this was technically your first time as a ward of the state\" you would be like \"are you kidding me?\"\n\nThird, they say she lied about her involvement with CPS. She certainly exaggerated when she said she knew the names of all the police officers in the county. She admits that. It's also a pretty obvious exaggeration.  She says she had multiple situations involving CPS, and Rhodes says no. Actually, CPS did investigate her family more than once, including in CT, but those records are very, very hard to get details from. She says she had broken bones, and Rhodes says this must be a lie because her hospital admission in 2014 doesn't indicate any previous admissions or surgeries--yeah, my admission records from my hospital stays don't have my full medical history either.\n\nAlso, note that so far none of these were representations she made to Rhodes, but rather ones she made in an application to a different program in 2015 when she was a senior in HS and still in the foster system and couch surfing. It's weird to nitpick like this for a teenager still recovering from trauma.\n\nThey also state she lied about her injuries, but their reasoning for this is piss poor. She said she had dried blood in her hair, but the hospital records don't say that--why would they? A nurse the NYer interviewed said she remembered helping her wash dried blood from her hair. But it's also not an injury and thus not something that would be in the medical record. They also use the fact that she says \"I can't breathe\"  because of rib injuries and didn't recognize her swollen features. They argue that she could breathe. I mean, her words were clearly intended as her saying how breathing was painful for her. This is ridiculous. Obviously she is breathing. Also, they argue her features weren't THAT swollen because the medical records don't say they were distorted. I mean, really.\n\nFinally, they say she misrepresented getting intimidating packages from her family because the Penn Police have no record of that. But she did go to Penn when she received a package with a bracelet from her mom, and her family also tried to contact her through Penn. Honestly, this just seems to be them saying \"that's not intimidating enough from our perspective\" and anyone estranged from abusive parents can tell you sometimes that's exactly what it looks like.\n\nPlus, the intimidating package language wasn't even hers--it was in a letter of reference written by someone else.\n\nI have gone through these documents again and again and I just can't figure out what the hell is going on here with Rhodes and Penn. They seemed to have agreed on a narrative and then done mental gymnastics to get the facts to fit it. I don't get it.",

On the one hand, one should never lie or otherwise misrepresent their background in order to gain an advantage, especially as this takes resources from those who truly have those backgrounds. See Rachel Dolezal and other inexcusable persons. On the other hand, academic currently rewards certain narratives in a way that rewards those who lie and exaggerate. I'm not excusing her. But she is not the only student here, or anywhere, who stretched the truth in big or small ways to make their applications more appealing to universities. I strongly suspect that many applicants do this. The university is not motivated to know whether these narratives are true or not. If many students lie to say they are minorities for example, this goes into the university's statistics, so it's a win for the university to look the other way. In this particular case, the university pushed back on her hard to avoid embarrassment for the university. They were perfectly happy to let false sob stories open doors without worrying about whether it is true. Somewhere there is an actual foster kid who went through what M claims to have experienced who is finding out they didn't get in here.

Teachers and her pediatrician took note of her many bruises--which she insisted at the time were 'her fault.' She kept a journal of what was happening. She was placed in foster care.

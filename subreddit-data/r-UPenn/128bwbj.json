    "postText": "Hi\u2014thanks in advance for reading! Here's a quick summary of my situation, any advice would be appreciated:\n\nI'm planning to study Urban Planning/Studies+Economics. \n\nI was recently admitted to the UPenn college of arts and sciences, where I would try to double major Urban Studies+Economics.\n\nAt UVA, I was admitted to their School of Architecture and Planning\u2014I called them and they said people can and do double major with their college of arts and sciences so maybe I could pull off Urban Planning+Economics but I'm afraid it could become a scheduling nightmare.\n\nI was also admitted to Amherst College and UChicago but I'm not considering those as seriously as UVA or Upenn (For Chicago, too many \"where fun goes to die\" horror stories, Amherst doesn't really have urban studies).\n\nAdvantages to UPenn:\n-In an Urban environment, which I prefer, especially for urban studies.\n-Economics and Urban Studies are in the same undergraduate school\n-Connections? \n\nAdvantages to UVA:\n-In-state, so it would save me about $150,000 on undergrad education.\n-Less competitive?\n\nAny thoughts on the feasibility/ease of double majoring at penn, and advice/thoughts on the decision? Thank you so much!!",

Philly was great, but if you\u2019re saving $150K as you say you are\u2026 take that and run. Seriously. Wasn\u2019t that long ago I graduated, but man if you ever do a grad school track, it *will* save you so much.\n\nEdit: Feel free to DM me if you want more in-depth advice, OP.",

And tbh Penn can also be quite depressing, but any school is what u make of it and if u go in with a positive attitude u will have a good time.",

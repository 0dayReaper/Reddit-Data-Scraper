    "postText": "\nHey Penn fam\n\nI'm an incoming grad student who's super excited to join the Penn community this fall. As I missed out on the typical undergrad experience due to COVID lockdowns, I'm curious about the interaction between undergrads and grads, as well as the social life opportunities available to the grad students.\n\nHow friendly are the undergrads towards grad students? Do they hang out together and form social connections or undergrads seem to have a typical \"privilege\" as the undergrad program acceptance rate is way lower to the grad programs. \n\n\nIs it possible for grad students to participate in Greek life at UPenn? Or is it typically limited to undergrads only? I'm not desperate lol just trying to do the things I didn't have an opportunity to do during the pandemic.\n\nI'm hoping to make the most out of my time at Penn and create a fulfilling social life that I didn't have the chance to experience during COVID. Any insights, personal experiences, or advice from current students  would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "I'm not sure about greek life, but from my time I don't recall there being any grad students.\n\nBut social wise, from when I was at Penn most of the grad/undergrad interactions tended to happen through extracurriculars. For example I know grad students who joined majority undergrad performing arts groups, or cultural groups or religious groups. \n\nThere isn't any real animosity or the privilege you're talking about. Really the lack of interaction tends to be mostly due to just being on different parts of your life. Undergrads tend to hang out with other undergrads who are taking the same entry level classes (except perhaps some ambitious seniors) and living in the same dorms, and who are usually around the same age (18-22). By contrast, grad students tend to skew a bit older (23-30s) and are just at a different stage of life in terms of what their priorities are and how they want to spend their free time. There is interaction between the two but think of it like how a college student doesn't really hang out around their old high school every day. \n\nTo my knowledge though there is a pretty robust graduate community. [GAPSA](https://www.gapsa.upenn.edu/) is kind of the equivalent to the undergraduate assembly, and your specific program will have graduate student mixers and such. Penn Law and Wharton/MBAs especially have a very tight knit community, but every school has their thing. So you won't be lacking for social interaction if you seek it out.",

Most of the grad student interactions I\u2019ve had have been as a result of class and depending on age it can be a bit hard to form friendships, but I\u2019m sure it happens! As for Greek life, I\u2019m not 100% sure but I don\u2019t know of any grad students involved. \n\nAnd as for the \u201cprivilege\u201d, it definitely happens, especially when grad students and undergrads take the same class. In my experience a lot of undergrads can kinda shit on grad students for being a bit slower to pick the material up, but that was just the case in the two mixed classes I\u2019ve taken, again, def not universal. As long as you\u2019re good on that front I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be an issue.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not sure on the Greek Life part. Regardless of age, I did not notice a lot of mixing with undergrad students while a grad student - I was too busy with research + programs/events with law/Wharton/other SAS grad program students. A majority of my social life came from my program itself. You\u2019ll also be focused on very different things professionally. Socially - sure, you might end up at some of the same bars as some seniors, or in the same extracurricular clubs/groups. You won\u2019t be lacking for events or socialization if that\u2019s what you want, I promise!\n\nThere are plenty of orientation events the first few weeks for grad students - even if they seem cheesy, go! I\u2019d also recommend taking a class outside of whatever school you\u2019re in, if your program allows it. Expands your network (socially and professionally) ie law students in my BEPP classes (even if not dual) became quick friends. Took a class at the law school as well and as a result, joined a lot of their events. Join clubs or attend their events/mixers!",

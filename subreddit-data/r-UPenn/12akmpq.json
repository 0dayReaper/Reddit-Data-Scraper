            "comment": "Let start with the majors. Data science is statistics + a bit of computing and CS compasses system, software, AI and vision, etc. DS is a subset of AI. DS workers often use only 25% of the technicals they learn in their degrees because the job emphasizes persuasion, influence and boss management. It's better for your boss to accept your ideas than you use the best statistic models. Exception is machine learning research, where you have to invent new tools. DS workers are placed under the domains of investment, marketing, product management, sports... So DS is a hybrid business and engineering field.\n\nOther CS realms are a more technical and rely much less on the softer side. You don't need to have a rich dad to get into the best job. But you need to be used to the life and workload of engineers.\n\nJob market: Working in a hybrid field, you need to, hence, socialize to get a good offer in DS, and possess the knowledge of a business domain, as well as the CS/SSE technicals. Honestly, ML and DS have less openings than other CS fields. The recent and persistent decline of start-up and Tech worsens the trend, since the central bank claims to ends the policy since 2008 to provide cheap capital to start-up and Tech.\n\nCMU: the workload in home work and class is lower than Penn CS or SSE (the two majors for DS), but the business side is less than Penn. However, if one wanna work in machine learning and DS researches, CMU has better vibe since Penn is too pre-occupational... CMU have more peers who wanna push the knowledge boundaries. Technical resources-wise, I dunno which school is better... you need to research\n\nPenn: Among the CS or SSE programs of top schools, Penn already has the lighter workload... Not in the number of courses but at least some courese are less rigorous. Penn is famous for the softer skills, such as putting of knowledge in a team setting, negotiation and networking. Also, Penn's brand allows switching to a better job after your 1st one.\n\nHowever, since the vibe is very pre-occupational, the peers are like your colleagues, or even competitors, instead of friends or at least classmates. The 1st semester is similar to a school, but then your are suddently in Penn Corporation, preparing for internship or job offers, studying 2 degrees in 4 years, or trying to submatriculate into master programs since the 2nd semester. In essence, the expectation gaps depress. Many people wanna enjoy a bit longer in a school, not to mess with networking, internship, job, submatriculation that early and frequent.\n\nThe courses in CS/SSE concentrating in DS are among the easiest among the engineering because you may choose to pick statistics and business courses, which consume significantly less hours. But you need to compare the number of engineering and math courses with CMU to guage the hardship.\n\nSuggestion: whichever school you go to, consider to do another major or degree in business, alongside with DS because it's hard to get a job just with DS skills. Penn allows students to an uncoordinated dual degree in business, you just need to plan early and speak to your advisor. I think CMU is similar. Also, DS and engineering jobs value a master degree, so you may consider submatricate into the master programs.\n\nCongr! Both acceptance are very good offers. DS is the best major to be an entrepreneur, and work on your own. Just follow your heart and the years coming will be fulfilling.",

                            "comment": "Honestly, I do not think any one relams of studies are easier than others. I claimed Stat/DS/ML is easier merely because the top thread mentioned 30 to 40 hours per course every week is unreasonable. Therefore, I reckon less class time is preferable in your opinion. Concentrating in data science as a CS/SSE major enables one to take some business and statistics classes to be counted in the curriculum. These classes takes less time in class and homework.\n\nNevertheless, less time in class and HW does not mean it is easier to get a high grade. More importantly, engineering courses pretty cover most of your responsibility as a tyro CS worker. However, business/statistics courses do not cover leading employees in other organizations, soliciting business when you are just 2 years into the job market and persuading your boss to accept your DS solutions. These skills are essentials if you want to work in DS, a subset of ML.\n\nI guess your easiness means straighforward to be understood. Then still engineering classes are still more difficult than statistics classes.\n\nIn short, do you want to work in the research/pure technical or business side? They call for very different skills, lives, characters, and salaries. If research, CMU is a better pick. If business, you may further research for the school you like and a dual degree/major in business is a good pick.",

You can go more applied if that\u2019s what you want, or you can do more theory. Career prospects are really good here as well.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions regarding any Penn\u2019s curriculum, research, or careers opportunities, let me know and I can try to help more.",

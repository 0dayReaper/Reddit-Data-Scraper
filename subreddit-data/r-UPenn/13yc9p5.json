Would appreciate any insight regarding certain professors and what the differences in course material/projects are in these courses. Trying to see which course is best to just learn as much relevant and actually applicable knowledge as possible.\n\nThank you all!",

If you are aiming for a course that can give you an overview of internet and web systems (as the course name suggests), and wants some hands-on experience in building a search engine from scratch (language is Java), then 555 is the right place. I took it just this Spring with Prof Haeberlen, and this coming fall Prof Linh is going to take over. Linh is very nice and she used to teach CIS505, which is about distributed systems. To be noted, not sure if you are aware of, 555 is definitely a heavy-loaded course. Keep this in mind, but I definitely recommend it! It worth the time and effort, and also have fun with the final project",

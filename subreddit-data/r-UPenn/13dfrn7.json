Are there worksheets online with the answer keys that can help me? Does anyone have worksheets with answers or any online resources they're willing to send? (I accept pms)",

Pretty much the only other thing you should do in terms of preparing for the test is practicing with the prior final exams, found here:\nhttps://www.math.upenn.edu/undergraduate/calculus-homepages/calculus/mathematics-104\n\nAnd don't let anyone make you feel bad about studying for credit??!?1? I did what you are doing, and relative to the whole summer, I didn't spend that much time studying for the credit exam, and I'm very glad I got the credit. So you do you.\n\nEdit: in terms of answer keys, I thought they had them for the posted finals but maybe not. The ones that are straight up computational use an online tool, and the rest you should also just Google. Hell, chatgpt might even be able to help (although you should never trust it without other confirmation)",

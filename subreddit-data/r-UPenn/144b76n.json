    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm an incoming freshman interested in psychology/cognitive science, and I'm wondering if I should take a math course my first semester at Penn. My current plan is to take intro to psychology, French, a writing class, and intro to computer science or intro to statistics my first semester. I haven't decided if I want to do premed or focus on computer science in cog sci yet. Should I take math 1410 my first semester to keep my options open? Please let me know what you think!",

Unless you\u2019re super confident about both, my advice is to not take cis110 and math114 together in your first semester. Let yourself get adjusted to college and the course difficulty at Penn before you take 2 hard classes in 1 sem. \n\nI am an \u201cunder achiever\u201d at Penn though and I struggled a lot transitioning from an urban, under funded HS. If you came from a great school or did something that already has strong rigor then you might be fine. Also, whatever you end up doing, request a tutor for your hard classes at the very beginning of the sem!",

                            "comment": "Ah ok I see! Sorry, I misunderstood your question at first. Well, do you have any other reasons for taking 1410? Because i think it would be irrelevant for all the options you\u2019re considering. You don\u2019t need it for pre-med requirements, cogsci, or psych. You do need a calculus class for premed, but it doesn\u2019t have to be 1140. Also, stat 1110 would count for psych major, cogs major, and premed. I think taking stat is your best bet in terms of keeping your options open! \n\nTaking cis 1110 isn\u2019t a bad idea either if you\u2019re more leaning towards cogsci, because if you want to do the computation concentration, you\u2019ll need it as a pre-req for some of the other classes. In my opinion, you have no real need to take 1410 at this point, unless there are other reasons behind that that you didn\u2019t already state.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re pre-med, avoid 1410 unless you need it for your major because it\u2019s a GPA killer. The class isn\u2019t curved and it\u2019s tricky.",

Stat 1110 definitely seems like the better option. I think I'll do that and save CIS 1110 for spring semester. Thank you again! This is all very helpful.",

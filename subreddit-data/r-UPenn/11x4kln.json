            "comment": "I took it with Professor Nelson. It's a cool course, and Professor Nelson is great as well. However, I have some advice/comments, coming from someone who did not do as well in the course as they should have:\n\n* The course really isn't about biology or even biophysics. You will learn some things about biophysics, but that's not the focus. It's more about using statistics and programming to answer questions in biology, creating mathematical models for phenomena like feedback loops, etc.\n* You'll be programming in Python and using Numpy and Matplotlib, so you should probably know the basics of those before the class.\n* The statistics part of the course was the hardest for me, as I had no real statistics/probability background. If you're the same, I'd recommend reading up on basic probability and probability distributions before the course. (I really like this Harvard guy's probability lectures: [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/youtube).) You'll be more prepared for the parts of the course dealing with Bayes theorem, Poisson distribution, etc.\n* Professor Nelson gave us a weekly assignment to write three brief questions/comments about the textbook readings. I assumed that these were basically a completion grade and were given 100%, but when the course ended, I learned that this was not the case. So... make sure your questions/comments are \"good\" (not sure exactly what that entails).\n* The course isn't very structured, and sometimes Professor Nelson will just talk about whatever new biophysics research thing excites him (which can be cool to listen to!).\n\ntldr: It's a great course, but you should approach it with the right mindset and preparation.",

But if you\u2019ve never coded before or you don\u2019t know any probability, you might find it more frustrating/confusing.\n\nFor me, the coding was pretty easy, as I had taken Phys 2600, which prepared me pretty well. But some of my classmates had never done any coding before, and they found the coding assignments to be long and difficult.",

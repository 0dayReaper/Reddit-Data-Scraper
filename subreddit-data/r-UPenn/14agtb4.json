When you add a class, the lectures will be labeled LEC, and right under that there will be many different sections labeled REC. On the path@penn course finder it tells you if that class has a mandatory REC section.  From what other have said these are like small group discussion led by TAs or other staff (not the actual prof) where u can ask questions and review material. Some have quizzes during these times (like math).",

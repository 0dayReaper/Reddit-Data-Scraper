(I was kinda sad BSE gets lumped with BS, lowkey wanted the engineering orange.)\n\nIf you keep an eye out for grad students doing photoshoots or going to their commencements, they'll generally have the more specific colors for different fields, eg business drab (beige/tan) for MBAs.",

The color assigned to a given hood trim and/or tassels and\u2014where appropriate\u2014gown facings, should be as closely related as possible to the field studied. For example, one who has earned a degree in animal husbandry would wear the maize of agriculture, as no color is specific to the subject of animal husbandry, and it is generally included within the broader field of agriculture.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/UPenn/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

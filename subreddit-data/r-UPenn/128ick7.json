    "postText": "I am an international student who was admitted to Penn in the ED round. \n\nWhen I opened my portal yesterday I saw an update which invited me to a program called Penn Global Scholars. Apparently, you cannot apply for the program; you have to be one of the ~15  invited international students to be a part of it. \n\nThis all sound perfect on paper, but I was wondering if the program is as good/niche as it sounds. Is it a big deal? Do you think it will significantly impact my life at Penn? Are there other programs at Penn which are invite-only? If yes, is the majority of students involved in such programs?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I don't think there's anything comparable to it at Penn Global (or anywhere else that I know of), most other programs are NSO based or residential communities (and those you also apply to). Most people don't know about PWS but I do think it's good for your resume and networking.     \nIf you opt in you'll have the option to attend some workshops and dinners at Perry World House, a DC Trip and you're automatically accepted to ILP (if they're still doing it).\nYou're invited to ~2 big events per semester.     \nSo it's fun and doesn't take a lot of time, I also got to know some of my best friends through the program.    \nI recommend it, but it's just one more thing you can do on campus.",

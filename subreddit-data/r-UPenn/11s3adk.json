    "postText": "I'm a CSIS certificate student who will be visiting campus for about a week. My husband and daughter (6) will be traveling with me. We're traveling by train and are staying just west of University City. While I'm in class during the day, my husband and daughter want to explore a bit. Being from a rural part of Virginia ... my only experience with public transportation in the city was a brief time we visited Philly in 2017. I mistakenly drove in and attempted to navigate on my own. Then we discovered the wonder that is the Philly Phlash (aptly named as my life certainly did \"phlash\" before my eyes as we jetted around the city - but that driver was damn impressive).\n\nThat being said, I'm trying to map routes for them to get to places like the Liberty Bell, Mutter Museum, etc., with relative ease. From what I understand, the Phlash isn't operational this time of year. Any tips for travel around the area and any ideas for things to do with a kid in University City during the day?\n\nThanks!",

Sometimes is a little bit dirty, but its an easy way to get around the city, and especially to old city (the market Frankfort line drops you right in front of Independence Hall at 5th st). directions using it are incorporated well into both apple and google maps. Get them a SEPTA key, have them register it, and then you can use it anytime you come back to Philly (reduces fares by a little bit and is refillable). there are busses, trains, and trolleys on the system that go all over the city",

            "comment": "Phlash is nice but is a bit of a tourist scam. The subway is the easiest public transit to navigate in philly. The way that I know which public transit stops to use, I just search the location on Google maps and then click the transit tab that is next to the car and walking options. You can toggle which modes of transit you want under the modes tab, so you can select to only show subway options if you want. At the subway stop you can just walk down the stairs and there will be electronic kiosks on the wall to pay for a ticket. After you buy the ticket you can pass through the turnstiles and board when the next car gets there. The stops are labeled by street numbers, so listen and look for the stop Google maps says to know when to get off. Pay attention to whether you are boarding on toward west or east on the Market Frankford line! \n\nHowever the subway isnt for everyone since it can get smelly and sometimes the seats are wet. Another popular option is the bus. I believe you can now pay with your phone but idk how that works. You can also pay $2.50 in exact cash when you walk in or you can tap a septa key. Google maps will tell you the location of the stop to board, the arrival time, and it will say the bus number you will get on (make sure you board the right one). Google maps should show you which stop you are at at all times, and then pull the cord when it's the about to get to your stop. Then you exit through the back doors.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a high school senior who got admitted to Penn off of ED. Unfortunately, senioritis hit me like a tank and there is a real possibility I have a B semester grade for all 4 of my core classes (should all be from the 87-89 range). Is there any possibility of me getting a warning email from Penn or worst case scenario, rescinded? Thank you so much!",

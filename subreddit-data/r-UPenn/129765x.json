    "postText": "Hello :) I am writing an article for the Daily Pennsylvanian investigating policies surrounding being rescinded/given warning messages after receiving receptance offers.\n\nI've seen that many students during last semester of high school year start to get very bad grades, like Cs, Ds or even Fs and began freaking out because they fear that they might get rescinded. And apparently Penn did not rescind them in the past but they did send a very angry message of warning. If anyone can tell me more about how Penn responded, their policies about  maintaining academic excellence after receiving offers, any relevant experiences or details about it, **please pm me!!**\n\nYou can be quoted anonymously on the DP if you want. Thank you!!",

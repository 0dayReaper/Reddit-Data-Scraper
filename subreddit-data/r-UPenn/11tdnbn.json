    "postText": "Does anyone know the why Brian Halak has a much lower difficulty and work required compared to the other professors for this class? \n\nAlso in general how much work does this class take - how hard are the weekly quizzes, how hard are the weekly essays (and how does chatgpt affect these assignments)?\n\nLastly, I usually get distracted in class/don\u2019t go which is fine for engineering classes since they\u2019re content focused and recorded? How is the classroom structured for this class, how much participation is needed to do well? (does it depend on the professor too?)\n\nThanks!!",

            "comment": "I took EAS 545 with Halak and I really liked him! Def one of my fav professors at Penn. I think the workload is probably similar across all sections cuz we all get weekly essays and quizzes. Quizzes are pretty straightforward as long as u do the readings, same with essays. They were not graded super harshly too as long as you touch on the main points. Attendance is mandatory unless you\u2019re excused. The classes were not recorded but lol I didn\u2019t pay much attention and did just fine. Hope this is helpful! :)",

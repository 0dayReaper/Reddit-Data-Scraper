This is typical for american liberal college. BDS, palestinian organizations, all garbage to be aware of. Make sure you keep yourself safe as they are loud violent and rude. If you need anything regarding them let me know, they\u2019ve been disciplined in the past for disgusting behavior",

Grow some balls and stop whining about war-related anti semitism, and this goes the same way for muslims complaining about Israel and war-related islamophobia. Take example from Balkans or Eastern Europe, no one victimizes themselves there because someone from an enemy country mocks them or does whatnot. This being said, I strongly condemn any form of criticism/phobia/negative sentiment that does not have its root from an ongoing military conflict.",

We do not provoke. Ever. this is not russia and ukraine, it\u2019s not a war and there\u2019s no invasion. Just this week 2 British jewish girls were killed 15, and 20 by palestinian terrorists. They were not israeli. this is hate",

            "comment": "The only class/department I know of that will hire second semester freshmen to TA is CIS. TAing doesn't reduce tuition, it's just a job. Generally to be hired as a TA you need to do well in the classes and often express interest in TAing to your professor, and they may consider reaching out. Some departments have an application to TA. (Notably math, but I think also some wharton classes?)  \nYou should not RA if you have any real level of aid as Penn will take that aid away and give you free housing. If your grant based aid is low, RAing can be a great way to reduce your overall bill (but you don't have housing during the summer and can sometimes have terrible bosses.) It's also extremely competitive to become an RA, so it can't be counted on.\n\nAnd if your expected family contribution is high but your family isn't contributing to your education, request repeals from FinAid. Sometimes it works. (Sometimes it doesn't.) Best of luck!",

Other than hustling with that and RAing for free housing, I can't think of anything else you could do. You can also find summer opportunities that pay well like an internship or an REU or something \n\nBiggest hustle is getting financial aid lol",

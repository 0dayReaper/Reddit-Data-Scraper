If you book a flight thinking you would get approved then it is your responsibility to take risks of it being denied. They literally delay the move-in date one week to mitigate spread of COVID on campus. If they approve too many requests then this delay is meaningless...\n\nAlso for those arguing the low wifi speed or bad conditions at home... It is literally just 3 days between the first day of classes and the first day of move-in. I do not see why it is bothering this much.\n\nYou have been through 2020 starting March up to the end of spring of 2021. And the pandemic situation now is even worse than at those times.",

They want Penn to allow them on campus to accommodate their already existing flight schedule.",

I know Penn admin sucks but I cannot see why it has any responsibility in this event. At the time of pandemic, an outbreak is very likely. If you book anything in advance, you would need to take risk of it being disturbed by the outbreak. It is very simple logic.",

I have encountered many assignments due week before they teach the material on how to do the assignment. Exam questions that are designed as \"stretch\" to see if you can figure out out. Not to mention exams intentionally designed so that is not possible to compete in the time allowed. So basically portions of the grade are measuring how good you are at self teaching and supplement the intentional sabotage. Yet we pay them to teach us, and they claim grades reflect mastery over taught subject.",

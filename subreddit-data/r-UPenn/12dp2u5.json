You don\u2019t get to choose whether or not you want a single or a double, but you do get to add a roommate if you want too. 1/3 of the quad will be renovated next year, so Lauder and Gregory are being converted to freshman housing only. On the application, you do have a questionnaire that you have to fill out in the chances you do have a roommate(s).",

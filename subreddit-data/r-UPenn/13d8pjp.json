I am aware that we'll be meeting with our advisors over the Summer, but I also want to get a sense of what my coursework may look like prior to that meeting so I don't feel like a complete idiot and can ask valid questions and express legitimate concerns.\n\nAre Huntsman kids subjected to the same first-semester requirements as a typical Wharton or CAS student? Actually, could someone who is familiar with this please PM me? Thanks in advance :)",

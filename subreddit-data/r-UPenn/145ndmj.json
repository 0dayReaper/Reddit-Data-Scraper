            "comment": "HES degrees are conferred by the President and Fellows of HU, w/ the consent of the Board of Overseers, and the FAS and HDCE/HES deans. They are standard HU diplomas, and the ALM is printed entirely in Latin. The elitist condescension towards the School \u2014 as well as its analogues across peer universities \u2014 is laughably unwarranted. With a \u201cbrick-and-mortar\u201d Penn BA and HU ALM myself, I can tell you they are of the same caliber; HES was grueling. The difference: At HES, _working_ adults overwhelmingly in their mid-30s and older are held to the same standards as all other HU students. The programs are delivered in an appropriate manner needed by executives. Plenty go on to other HU professional schools, incl. HMS and HBS. I could go on about similarities and differences. If curious, send me a DM. \n\nWhile I can\u2019t speak to LPS\u2019 current online-only programs, I would say this:\n\nThe post-secondary educational paradigm has drastically changed over the last five to 10 years. The executive/extension schools offer the same rigor and deserve the same respect. Those who balk at them as less \u2014 however well intentioned \u2014 are ignorant. Do not cut yourself short; consider on-campus and executive programs as appropriate for you, and go for it! Check the ego (and others\u2019) at the door. \n\nBest wishes on your academic journey!",

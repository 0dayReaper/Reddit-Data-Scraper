            "comment": "In my 3 years at Penn so far, Grit Lab has been my favorite course. I have no regrets after taking this class whatsoever. In fact, I wish I could retake it!\n\nYou learn so much about yourself and your dynamics with those who support you, your goals (and how to achieve them in a realistic, step-by-step approach), the science behind our passions (focusing too on the science of grit itself, of course), skills, and personal attributes that contribute to our success. It changed the way I see myself and others, and how I look at my current and future goals. The class is large, but Dr.Duckworth makes it so easy for community building to take place. I'm still in touch with some of the seniors that were in my group when I took the class (I was a freshman).\n\nThis is the only course I recommend everyone take, regardless of major. The things you learn in Grit Lab can be applied is just about every aspect of your life (the research is very well-supported). The projects/activities are eye-opening, and you are often encouraged to base them on your personal experiences and talents. Grit Lab gives you the tools to improve yourself and your life, make better decisions, and use your strengths to your advantage. You may also get to participate in interviews with important people (won't say who we got to interview previously, but they were all highly influential in their fields, and even outside of them). And to top it all off, Dr.Duckworth is an excellent and genuine professor who really wants to see you succeed. The TAs also rock. I could go on and on about this class, but only because I found it to be the most valuable time I've spent at Penn.\n\nTL;DR- Do yourself a favor: take Grit Lab!!",

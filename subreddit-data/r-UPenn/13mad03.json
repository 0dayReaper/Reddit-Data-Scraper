    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am hoping to be assigned a single room wether in a suite or a \u201cregular\u201d housing option. I can be a very anxious person so I really appreciate having a space for myself. Is there a way to show on the housing application that I would prefer a single room? For example for Hill where there are singles and doubles I understand, is it possible to specify on the housing application I prefer a single? I appreciate all and any help, thanks in advance!",

Something similar also applies for Lauder, but I\u2019ve heard Lauder is not guaranteed as it\u2019s pretty popular.\n\nAs you mentioned anxiety, if you were referring to it in a medical sense (it would be easier if you have some documentation or a note from a doctor), you can go through Weingarten and they might guarantee a single room.",

If you need a single for medical reasons, you should fill out the self identification form for Disability Services now (their priority deadline for that is Monday and to have the whole process, incl meeting with your assigned specialist, done it's June 7 to ensure you will be placed into a single before other students). Even if you don't have all paperwork, get the process started so that they can help you forward!",

And what they would ask from me to be placed in it? I am afraid of doing this special medical reason request in case it comes with extra costs or limitations or weird requirements.",

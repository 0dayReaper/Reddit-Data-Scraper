    "postText": "I have an old iPad (iPad Pro 9.7 in) that works perfectly fine. However, it's not my iPad; it's my parent's Ipad. They offered to give it to me because I would benefit a lot from it, especially in college. Sometimes I find it annoying because it's not connected to my iCloud account, so I have to airdrop and message any files I have. Should I consider getting a new iPad? Do you guys have any recommendations? I have a tight budget. Does the apple education discount work?",

            "comment": "Apple college discount works, I used it to get an iPad last year. I forget how much it discounts but its a decent discount.\n\nPersonally I think an old iPad is fine. All depends on what you plan on using it for. I only take handwritten notes on mine (I have a windows laptop), so most of my work on my iPad just stays there. All complex or document work I do on my laptop. If I was in your shoes I see little to no advantage to buying a new device.\n\nAlso... just change the icloud account on the iPad? Or use apps that sync, like google docs to prevent having to constantly throw files back and forth.",

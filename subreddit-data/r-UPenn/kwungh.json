    "postText": "Thank you. I am silently thanking you when you stand far away from me, when you follow the guidelines of exits, and arrive to the dining place on time. \n\nI almost had a panic attack in Hill just trying to find what I wanted to eat. If you are traveling in groups, talking back to the cafeteria workers, or ignore me when I ask you to step back.... you are a child. I have zero respect for you and it makes me question your intelligence. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re cool, and I am taking notes of who to never trust or befriend. \n\nTake the responsibility seriously. No one cares that you get to flaunt your Canada goose in front of 10 people in hill. There are others trying to just get in and get out.",

People going the wrong way through exits, large groups of people not even distancing from other groups, and 6 feet apart signs means fuck all apparently. I felt bad for an older couple waiting in line since they were surrounded by people not distancing. Stay safe out there.",

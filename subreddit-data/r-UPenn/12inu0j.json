If she violates it, she definitely has to be fired.\nShe can't go around discriminating in a classroom because no one should feel excluded or discriminated against in a class.\nIf she is this bad up front, I don't know what kind of advantages she gives to white students compared to other races behind the curtains.",

Everybody will wait till they don't have to deal with her at all.\n\nAs per the above article, students don't have to come forward to say anything. She herself started to claim that black students are incapable of succeeding in law school.\n\nHow does she know who is getting good grades and who isn't?\nThe article has a link to how she violated the school's blind grading policy.\n\nI also read another article at that time where she exclaimed, \"Oh, finally a normal white student.\" That is not holding views outside the classroom. That is clear discrimination inside the classroom and easily shows that she is capable of treating different students differently.",

She then sees after the fact which students received which  grades, and she would know all of the students based on Cold-Calling. The technicality is that on the margins, professors can give higher grades to three folks per semester on the edges based on participation. That's very marginal though. She was referring to top 1/4 of graduating class which can be shown thru Latin Honors publicized. Even that is factually incorrect, but she prefaced \"I don't think, not \"I know\" Her statement about 1/2 is complete bogus so that's something. She also tends to make arguments around succeeding at 'elite' institutions, and admissions standards, not the right to attend assuming they I guess in her mind make the LSAT cut. She didn't violate any policy w/grading because she didn't reveal anything related to individual groups within her class specifically, nor did Dean Ruger mention that in his 12-pager to the Grievance Committee. \n\nShe's not in an at-will situation so hate the system, not her for pushing the boundaries of it. If she were an employee at a corporate company she would be fired tomorrow. Also, pretty sure discriminative is a compliment vs discriminatory.\n\nIn academia, repulsive voices have a place unfortunately and at least in my view it's good practice bc the real world is a lot more unsafe than Penn.",

Is it possible that some individuals may have different definitions of what constitutes bigotry, and if so, how do we reconcile these differing perspectives? I'm not saying I have the answers. But I don't think it's as black and white as you make it.   \n\n\nAs I said to others, I appreciate you sharing your perspective.",

Amy Wax has (to my knowledge) done 0 of those things. It\u2019s not a debate/discussion with her, it\u2019s her going on her racist cronies talk shows and saying she rarely sees black students in the top half of her class (proven false by alumni) or that she thinks Western culture is superior and societies ills are due to immigrants. These aren\u2019t debatable/discussable. There is no apology even though these statements are wildly hurtful. So how can her perspective be respected and considered diversity of thought when she at baseline does not think certain groups equal? It can\u2019t.\n\nDiversity of thought is based on a level of mutual respect and a same basis of facts. Amy Wax does not follow those tenets.",

Also, her three most controversial comments were not made on \"her racist cronies talk shows\". Her argument that western culture is superior was made in the Philadelphia Inquirer (and then restated in the Wall Street Journal). Her comment about Black students not finishing in the top of the class was made at a forum hosted by Glenn Loury who, while he may be conservative, is also a ground breaking Black economist. Her comment about Asian immigrants was made on Loury's podcast.\n\nMore to the point, these statements are the ones that get the most notice, but they are part of a larger argument she is making and this is where OP's concern comes in. Her argument about Western civilization was made in response to what she saw as a growing argument that Western civ doesn't hold positive value.  Her argument about her Black students was that affirmative action leads to mismatch. Her argument about Asian immigrants was that assimilation is a good thing. We may disagree with her about these things, but these are not positions that should be simply shunned as unacceptable within academia. \n\nSo, then, the problem is distinguishing between someone who makes these arguments respectfully and someone who makes these arguments harmfully. But, a great many who oppose these arguments believe that there is no way to hold these positions without it being harmful. So we're back at the problem originally raised by OP. \n\nAs far as Wax's tenure, this discussion should feel much more familiar for most of us. These arguments, in the way they are positioned and leveled, are nearly identical to anti-communist arguments during the Red Scare. Communism, they argued, was simply incompatible with American culture and any argument for it is a bad faith attempt to destroy society. I'm much more sympathetic to Marx's ideas than Wax's, but any decision to sanction Wax based on these arguments (incompatible with common decency, is a fundamental threat to community, no good faith version of the argument) is setting up someone I do agree with to face the same sanctions in the future when fickle cultural attitudes inevitably shift again.",

It\u2019s the interpretation and consequences of those sets of \u201ctrue\u201d facts that is debatable. For example, a creationist and someone who believes in evolution will not be able to have a productive debate because they pull from two different sets of \u201cfacts\u201d: the bible and science. Thus there is no overlap because there is limited mutual ground of truth.\n\nAmy Wax pulls from a set of ideas that sees other cultures as inferior. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you come at her with evidence from a factual basis of equality that this is not true, she will continue to not believe it, or deny that the studies were conducted well, etc. When there is this mismatch and unwillingness to accept all of the data put forth as true, there is an inability to debate or discuss or be productive. So there isn\u2019t diversity of thought because there is an unwillingness to find a mutual set of facts to be debated.",

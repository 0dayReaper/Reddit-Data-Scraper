    "postText": " \nI\u2019m going to be a junior, so I\u2019ve completely and utterly missed the boat on IB recruiting for next summer. And to be honest, it was never really on my radar, as I didn\u2019t think I was cut out for that type of job. But now as summer dawns upon us, I\u2019m really starting to regret my inaction. Just seeing the salaries for some of these positions is making me regret not going after it, as that sort of financial stability would be hard to pass up regardless of what it took. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m wasting my Wharton degree by not pursuing the most lucrative type of readily available employment - I just didn\u2019t have that foresight going into the past year and missed the ship. Has anyone else dealt with this situation and made it into the field or is it too late? Or am I just misguided about my interest in IB and regrets not to get a job in it in the first place? Any thoughts appreciated.",

There are still countless handshake postings, LinkedIn inmails, etc etc etc. As someone who just went through the process with respectable results, I think it's almost a blessing that you haven't had to commit yourself so early in the process, and you can practice more discretion when it comes to figuring out what ib means for you, and what it is about the field that makes it worth it to you.. I know people here and there that managed to get things going that were marginally related to IB, then recruited for full-time off-cycle. all in all, I think it's in your best interest to make the most of what you have now,  leverage the people you know, and hope that timing is just right for full-time (IF its something you know you still want to do).",

You gotta try and do it, you have to shoot for the moon and hope you land for the stars, you have to do everything you can to get it, and if you never give up, you'll never fail. And even if you did, is it better to have tried your best and failed or to regret never having tried at all?\n\nBeyond that, financial security is important. The economy is also going to shit, but even if you're making 100k a year (def feasible as a wharton grad) or some shit like that, I'd still say that's financially secure. My family came from nothing and I never dreamed of that kind of money. So yeah, 200k is more financially secure than 100k but at the end of the day I'd still say you're secure. Do you think that once your needs are met, will you still lament not having that extra money? You have to think about what money means to you. Does enjoying your job matter to you? How much does it matter to you? These are questions no one can answer and there is no universal answer, if there was than everyone including myself would be doing IB \n\nAnd if you want something, make sure it's not because it's the \"best\" or because everyone says you should, because you'll feel like an idiot later because it doesnt satisfy you. or maybe it won't. But if it's what you really wanted, deep inside of you, then everything would be so much more clear.\n\nYou have some soul searching to do, and I also think it is not too late to do IB, or any career for that matter. But think about it",

They make a lot and spend A LOT but they are already talking about exit options because they are miserable at work everyday. Sure they have a lot of fun when they are not working but that time is small compared to working hours. Basically most people get burnt out quickly though some people dedicate their life to money and stick with it. Depends on your personality",

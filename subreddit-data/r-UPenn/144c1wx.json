I am a memory athlete (basically memorizing random stuff as quickly as possible) but have not met like-minded individuals at Penn. I was thinking of starting a memory club for Penn. If anyone is already in the field of memory training or is interested in it, I would love to hang out and make Penn's memory club/team happen.",

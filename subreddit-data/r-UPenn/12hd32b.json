    "postText": "I was admitted to Penn as an international student on a full-ride. I was thinking I would only have to pay for my personal expenses, but I stumbled upon [this article from Daily Princetonian](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/03/international-students-financial-aid-loans-tax-burden) which states that international students have to pay taxes for the portion of the scholarship that exceeds the cost of tuition.\n\nIt seems that [Penn DOES NOT pay this tax](https://srfs.upenn.edu/financial-aid/international-taxes) on behalf of low-income international students. I wanted to ask how much y'all were taxed (as a student on a full-ride, I estimate I'll be taxed at $2500) and if it's possible to get a loan from the University. I'd also be grateful if you could comment on the payment deadline, payment plans etc.",

            "comment": "Yes, there is a tax on financial aid on the portion that's beyond tuition, fees, and books. In fact, financial aid beyond tuition, fees, and books needs to be reported in taxation by domestic students as well, though many don't.\n\nI don't know why the amount is that large for Princetonians - mine (EFC 3k ish) was $998.48 this year and (if I read the documentation correctly) $1,236.62 last year. However, depending on whether your home country has a tax treaty with the US, you may be able to claim this amount back.\n\nSince Penn pays the tax for you and bills it from you, you will be dealing with SRFS for this. I haven't had any special arrangements for this, but generally, you should be able to work with them to figure it out and get a loan if needed.\n\nAlso, depending on your exact situation and EFC, you may get a refund from Penn that you can then use to cover this expense, or you can use what you earn from work study. Penn budgets a good amount of money for you personal expenses, and at least I don't use/need nearly as much.",

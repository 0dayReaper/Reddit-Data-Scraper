    "postText": "Hi all! I am hoping to bring my car to Philly when I start my grad program this fall, but the places I'm looking at don't come with parking. How is street parking in the Spruce Hill, Walnut Hill, Clark Park, and West Powelton neighborhoods? Will I need to have an assigned parking spot or will I be okay with street parking?",

You\u2019ll also have to either (1) be a little bit careful about finding the untimed parking spots, or (2) if you have a car with PA license plates you can pay for a parking permit with the PPA.",

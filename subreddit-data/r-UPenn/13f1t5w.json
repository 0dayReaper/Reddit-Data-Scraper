    "postText": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone has any insight into the acceptance timeline. I know the acceptance deadline is the 31st, but I was wondering if they usually release decisions before then. For current students or grads - What did your applications look like? What was your GPA, and what did you have on your resume? How much time do you have to accept the offer if you are admitted? Enough time to figure out finances? I can't believe how late the application process is for a program that starts in August!",

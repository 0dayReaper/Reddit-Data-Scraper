    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone, I got admitted to Upenn Weitzman School of Design for the Master of Urban Spatial Analytics. I am currently working on my application for the Graduate Residence Advisor position. I need some support with what my letter of interest should be like; it would be more helpful if someone went through the same process and got selected. Furthermore, I want to know the best college houses for Graduate students and also a breakdown of houses that are more competitive so that I can put a blend of competitive and less competitive houses so that I don't miss my chances.\n\nMy priority deadline is on the 10th I would appreciate any help regarding my questions. Thanks in advance, and I\u2019m looking forward to joining Penn\u2019s enriched community.",

            "comment": "Hi! Some general advice: \n\n\\- high rises are most competitive (rodin, harnwell, and harrison) and the quad/freshman dorms are least competitive (because they don't come with kitchens -- not sure how different this is if you are a grad student though); four year houses are usually a good shot too I think (stouffer mayer, dubois, gregory)\n\n\\-focus on specific examples of what would make you a good RA -- the job requires a lot of event planning, communication, and being able to handle conflict (probably most common). Try to focus on what makes you good at those skills\n\n\\-Lastly, if you are considering being an RA, I recommend just becoming familiar with the unionization issue going on right now.

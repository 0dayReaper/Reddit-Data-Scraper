            "comment": "I have been where you were. In December 2014 (my sophomore year of undergrad), I knew I needed help and did not seek it voluntarily for both financial reasons and pride/feeling like I didn't deserve it. I did attempt something stupid and the only reason I'm here today is my best friend found me in time. I spent 10 days in the hospital involuntarily (normal followed by psych) and while it felt impossible back then, I am so, so grateful I failed and got the help I desperately needed. \n\nSpeaking as someone who knows how it feels, please, please get help voluntarily and don't let financial concerns stop you. The student insurance is actually good, looks like it's even better than what I have, and a hospital will work out a payment plan if you need one. If you truly do not feel like you are safe right now, you do not even need to go through CAPS. You can walk into any in-network ER (not urgent care), tell them you feel suicidal, and they will help you and admit you if needed. Penn Presbyterian and Pennsylvania Hospital both have inpatient acute care psych units. You can skip ambulance fees if you can get to a hospital yourself. Given that you do have insurance, it really is better to go and risk a bill than risk hurting yourself. Most acute stays are short and stabilize you enough to be managed with outpatient psych services. I promise you, things can get better if you can just get through right now.",

As a reminder, you can also always call or text 988 if you need to talk and cannot get ahold of CAPS or another resource. Its 24/7 and free to use. There are a lot of caring people who work and volunteer for that hotline.",

            "comment": "Please DM me. I have strong opinions and can provide info since I was institutionalized by Penn in February.\nI believe I'm qualified to answer this. I was voluntarily sent to an inpatient mental hospital by CAPS on 2/20.    Since a lot of other people have already talked about the insurance specifics (100 USD/stay if in network), I'll talk a little about what to expect.\n\nFor me, CAPS ended up bringing me to the Penn Hospital ER, where they evaluated me and O stayed there for about 24 hours while I was waiting for them to find me a bed open at an inpatient mental hospital. That was the most boring since it was just me waiting with one book, and there weren't really other people to talk to. From there, I got sent to an actual inpatient mental hospital. \n\nI will say, that the largest aspect of my negative experience there was because of the Penn administration, which happened because I went through CAPS. If I were to ever go through something like this again, I would tell a therapist, but not a CAPS therapist. I had some pretty significant issues with SIS at Penn that really hindered my recovery.",

            "comment": "Hi there! I used to work as an EMT on my undergrad institution campus and encountered a lot of students who had the same concerns as you, and I recognize that for low income students the financial factor might make people worried about getting care. First of all, you are certainly far from the only student who is feeling this way, and the most important thing is that you get whatever level of help you need!  There are lots of options, but if you need inpatient services, then your student insurance would be billed just like with any other hospital stay. If you sought help voluntarily (I.e., you are not being admitted on a hold) then most likely, you would be evaluated in an emergency department and then admitted for further evaluation and treatment if the team thinks it makes sense. I know this is overwhelming to think about, but money should not be a barrier in you getting help to stay safe and alive. There are often hospital financial relief programs to support people who can't afford the bills if there are left over charges outside of what insurance will cover. My suggestion is to contact CAPS asap. Communicate your SI with them, and let them know that you are feeling concerned about the cost of treatment. Hopefully they can help you figure out your options and assuage your fears. Please reach out to any other friends, family, hotlines, or resources as well. I'm proud of you for taking the first step in recognizing these feelings and figuring out how to get help!",

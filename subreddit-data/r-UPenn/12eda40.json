Invested donations to Wharton go into the Penn endowment and are earmarked for Wharton use.\n\nRead about endowment performance here: finance.upenn.edu/financial-reports/\n\nAccording to Penn FY23 budget, Wharton got 91M from investment income which I think means from the endowment, and endowments typically take 5% out annually, so you could consider the \u201cWharton endowment\u201d to be 1.8B. (The total Penn endowment is about 38.5B, so this seems about on par). \n\nFY23 Budget: budget.upenn.edu/operating-budget/ (pennkey access needed)\n\nThis was back of the napkin though someone correct me with a more rigorous answer if it exists.",

Where did you get the 38.5B figure?\n\nYour estimate sounds reasonable to me. I guess the only way to have a better answer would be to apply the same logic to previous years",

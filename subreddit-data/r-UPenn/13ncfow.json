    "postText": "Hey everyone I am filling in the housing application and I am unsure of where to rank Du Bois College house. I heard that it is often regarded as a safe community place for black students. I am not black or from the USA so I am not 100% sure of what this means, but I do hope to act respectfully and responsibly. I am unsure if it is okay to rank this college house high in the application list, as I am interested in the accommodation style it offers and it would be cool to meet people from different cultures. I would really appreciate any and all advice! :)",

If this does not apply to you then you should not apply because your presence takes away from the community the house tries to foster.",

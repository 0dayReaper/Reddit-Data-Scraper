Seems good and has more effective features than Penn course review.\n\nPenn Course Review just has ratings which are indeed useful but quite hard to make a judgement. We always have to ask around a diverse set of students to make an informed decision. \n\nBoth review systems can definitely be made better and I'm looking forward to it  cus the quality of teaching would skyrocket!",

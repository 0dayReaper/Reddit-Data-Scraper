They say to be prepared to spend 5 hours a day in class and to do hw. In your experience, is it more of a summer school experience, or is it more laid back and social rather than academic?",

            "comment": "I just finished my second year, but I did PFP before my first. It was a great experience and I'd definitely recommend it! The workload really wasn't too bad; yes, you have to spend time outside of classes working, but it's mostly stuff that will help you prepare for Penn classes, so you'll have seen a lot of it before. There's plenty of time left for socializing, and a lot of planned events that will help you meet people (this was really helpful for me because I don't naturally approach people on my own). Most of my friend group is still made up of other PFPers, and as an added bonus, I felt extra ready for my first semester of real classes because of the work I did in PFP.",

I could be totally wrong but I think Wharton students take one math course and two Wharton-specific (i.e. business-related) courses. The grades don't mean anything - the program is pass-fail, and you'll receive an elective credit if you pass all three courses.",

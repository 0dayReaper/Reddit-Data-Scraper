    "postText": "The Drexel Flea Market is almost a week away!\n\nThere was some questions about what will be sold there under my last post. I am a recent Drexel graduate that only vends at the Drexel flea market twice a year so I am looking to get rid of everything. I am only bringing items that I think college students would be interested in. \n\nI can not speak for others but I will be selling lots of shot glasses, maybe some shot skis, many decommissioned road signs (many more than last time), a couple of fold-up 8\u2019 beer pong tables, a lot of affordable jewlery (earrings, necklaces, rings, bracelets, anklets), and some miscellaneous collectibles and items. \n\nI have made it a point to not bring anything that would be considered overpriced. I am there to get rid of everything, so items will be priced to sell quickly. If you come and disagree, please talk to me. I can try to explain my reasoning behind a price or I am very open to discounting an item if convinced it is overpriced.",

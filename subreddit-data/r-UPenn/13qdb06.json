I won\u2019t go too into the details but suffice to say it\u2019s hiking and camping for 3 days and tons of fun. You can list dietary preferences so don\u2019t worry about food",

The program itself doesn\u2019t teach much other than getting involved in student government and is essentially ice breakers for 3 days straight, but by the end, it becomes a really tight knit community where everyone knows everyone. It\u2019s comforting entering Penn with 50 friendly faces when NSO is a mad dash to make friends. Although you\u2019ll definitely make good friends at Penn, it\u2019s nice to get to know a smaller group intimately. Another huge pro would be that the leaders are all prominent leaders on campus (ex the president of UA/student government, other big consulting/finance clubs, frats/sororities) and are really willing to help you succeed and get into these positions (nepotism goes hard ). I\u2019m biased towards Pennacle, but any Pre-O is going to be an amazing experience. You or anyone can PM me if you have any questions or want more insight.",

I didn't worry about making friends at all because I found people I truly loved in this program (I am also rooming with one of them next year). It makes sure your not lonely in those first few weeks. It also gives you good connections with the leaders, who are often very heavily involved in the Penn community.",

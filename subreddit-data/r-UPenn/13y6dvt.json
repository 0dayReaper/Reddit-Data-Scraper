    "postText": "So I've been working in a translational medicine lab since spring semester. It was slow in the Spring, but I figured it would pick up in the summer. So far, all I've done is run extremely long PCR and gel experiments. Every day, I spend about 40 minutes doing the same thing as the day before. That's it. I spend the next 5 hours sitting there doing absolutely nothing waiting for the instrumentation to finish running. I've expressed my concerns to the people that are training me, asking for more to do, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. They assure me that it will get better eventually, and that they can't really give me more stuff because I'm not trained yet.\n\nI personally feel very frustrated. I understand that there's not much for me to do, but I just do the same basic things over and over, and don't understand how it will get better. I'm personally a little slower when it comes to doing research, as it often requires several repetitions before I can do it seamlessly myself. The people that are training me have clinic obligations as well and are so busy I don't really get the oversight and training I feel I need.\n\nI could be overreacting--I've only been working for about a week this summer, but I've felt this way since January and just assumed it would get better. It hasn't. It's really frustrating. Spending the summer away from friends and family, waking up early every day, all just to have a really negative experience thus far that doesn't feel like it will improve all too much.\n\nI was thinking about going to school for an MD or PhD after I graduate, but this experience really makes me hate that idea. Biology and chemistry have always been my thing, but now I am unsure if I should even continue on this path. I am really confused as to what I should do. Should I try to stick it out and just hope it works for me? Should I seek a new lab even though it's the summer? I would probably try to avoid translation medical research after this experience. Based off of previous research projects I've worked on in high school, I've found that I enjoy working on hands on projects that keep me busy all day, providing consistent work from 9-5 or 6. While these projects are often more tiring, I've found that they are more fulfilling and I enjoy the fast paced learning and the day to day lifestyle much more. Should I change labs? If so, what subject might be interesting and keep me busy? For reference, I have fairly solid chemistry, physics, and math backgrounds as well. ",

If you find the lab not engaging, most likely not because of the lab environment but bio lab itself.",

Unfortunately, sometimes lab work is monotonous.\n\nIf you have the skillset for it/are willing to build the skillset for it, I highly recommend something away from the bench. I'm talking about something either engineering-heavy (i.e. computational biology, clinical informatics) or something more in the humanities + social sciences (bioethics, health disparities, public health). In either, you can find unique ways to apply your bio/chem knowledge.\n\nWorst-case scenario, you should also schedule an appointment with Dr. Ann Vernon-Grey at CURF. She's really good at teaching undergrads to advocate for themselves and can even help you think of what to say to your PI/postdoc.",

As a full-time researcher, I sometimes stack experiments to minimize true downtime or do data analysis/assay planning/budget stuff/literature review/cleaning while waiting for things to run. If you really can't stand long wait periods, this may not be the field for you because they're pretty much inevitable. Lab work also does involve a lot of repetitive elements- I've been doing nothing but DNA extractions 3 days a week for the past month because that's what currently needs to be done for our research. (1 day a week I have clinical sample processing and data obligations, 1 day a week I have meetings almost all day)\n\nBut what PCR or gel are you running that takes 5 hours of downtime? My PCRs and qPCRs usually take around 2 hours and gels usually run for about 1 hour max...",

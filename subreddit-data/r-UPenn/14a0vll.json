    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI am an incoming international student and I would like to know if the ISO and PSI insurance plans are as good as the PSIP. They cost approximately a third of the PSIP, so I am wondering what is the catch. Has anybody bought the PSI or the ISO plan? Do they have the same coverage, deductible, coinsurance, and covered services, and if so, how is the difference in the cost explained?\n\nThank you very much!",

I just think that this difference in cost has to be explained somehow, and I do not want to find out the bad way, should I purchase it.",

As for the difference, I went through the same thing, but for some reason this isn\u2019t available to domestic students so it feels to me like some sort of \u201cbulk\u201d deal with Cigna/Aetna but I\u2019m not certain. A lot of domestic students are likely on their parents\u2019 insurance so may not opt for PSIP. All I know is every international student I know had one of these. But I\u2019d suggest you wait for more responses :)",

    "postText": "I know a lot of people already have made posts about this in the past but I wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts on my situation. I'm an incoming freshman and am debating over whether I should take Math 1410 or Math 1610 in the fall. I took AP Calc BC my junior year and took what my school called \"multivariable calculus\" my senior year. While my teacher was great, we didn't get to cover what would be Volume 4 (Fields) of Prof Ghrist's 1410 videos and we didn't go as far in depth as 1410 does in the other volumes.\n\nI'm planning on majoring in economics at the college and doing a minor in math. It says that 1610 and 2600 are recommended for those wanting to be math majors. But, I've also heard that 1410 would be more helpful for the math used in econ as 1610 is more proof-based and theoretical while 1410 is more computational. I feel like I'd be interested in learning all the details in 1610, but I was wondering if 1610 would be worth it and helpful for my course plan.",

            "comment": "1610 is generally considered to be an easier class to do well in(grade), but as you noted its far more proof based making it harder to learn. Depending on your background and how you learn, the proofs may be more compelling. \n\nHowever most people who are non math majors (even those minoring in math) probably benefit from 1410 more.",

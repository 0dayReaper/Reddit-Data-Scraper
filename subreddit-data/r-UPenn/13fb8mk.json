I have not had trouble finding a description of it online, but I am curious as to \n1) how to apply\n2) how I can become eligible\n3) would I benefit from this program\n\nI am also looking into the Penn PFP program this summer. I haven\u2019t received an invitation. Should I be concerned about this?",

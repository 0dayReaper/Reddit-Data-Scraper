    "postText": "Hi everyone. I received the admission confirmation from UPenn CGGT a few days ago, and I am excited. Nonetheless, I still need to decide on which university I should choose. Hence I am trying to get more information on this program. Unfortunately, I can't find much about it...and the ones I found are mixed reviews (even from years ago), and I am not sure whether they are still valid. The sites I've checked are [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/27897613/answer/92266212), [this website](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-803230-1-1.html) (sadly this page can't be automatically translated to English..), and ofc Reddit. My major questions are:\n\n* How is the teaching quality?\n* Are the modules useful for future career/research?\n* What are the career prospects of the graduates (especially for those who need immigration working visa sponsorship)?\n\nI think the best place to ask my questions is in this thread. \n\nThank you very much, and your answers are highly appreciated!",

You need to find a Chinese student at CGGT to answer your questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can find Penn CGGT 2021 placements here:\n\n[https://cdn.uconnectlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2022/07/2021\\_SEAS\\_Masters\\_Career\\_Plans\\_Survey\\_Report.pdf](https://cdn.uconnectlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2022/07/2021_SEAS_Masters_Career_Plans_Survey_Report.pdf)\n\nSeveral are Chinese positions.",

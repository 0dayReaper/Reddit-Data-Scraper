You can't change it at this point (as far as I know), but its pretty common for availability to change rapidly in courses following Advance Reg result release. If you're a senior that needs this class to graduate or a sophomore who needs it to declare, it wouldn't hurt to reach out to both your advisor, the prof, and someone from the dept head, but I wouldn't sweat it. Turn on course opening notifs and try to snag an opening if you don't get it early on. Good luck!",

            "comment": "OP, honestly speaking, this is a bad schedule. I think it's general consensus among premeds not to take 3 STEM courses in ur first semester unless ur doing a special program. Start with 2 STEM (math, chem), a writing class, and a freshman seminar or another class ur interested in- a mixture of 2 heavy stem classes with 2 \"simpler\" ones. Then in Freshman spring, once ur used to the rigor and once u build ur studying habits, u can take 1 more STEM class.   \n\n\nIt's up to you, but that's what I learned after researching for over a year now.",

I guess my reasoning was that by getting more STEM classes out of the way in freshman year I could just take easier classes alongside Orgo in sophomore since that is so difficult\u2026 but maybe your way is better\u2026. I wonder if anyone has tried these three together and if they were successful?",

            "comment": "Your really want to take an easy course load your first semester. College is much much harder than high school. You should take chem, writing seminar, finish your language requirement, and then a sector/fundamental requirement (I suggest into to sociology, it is tested on the MCAT) don\u2019t worry about making your life later easier (taking easy classes w orgo), you will be used to college then. Your GPA is the most imp. Part of college when your premed and if you get a very bad gpa freshman fall (which is very easy to do, ppl get Cs in 1300) you will be trying to make it up the rest of college.",

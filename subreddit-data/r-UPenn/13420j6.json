I was wondering if there is a difference between fisher and ware in terms of the events that the houses have for its students, the rooms/bathrooms, or anything else.\n\nFor additional context I am pursuing either a double or triple.\n\nThanks again in advance!!\n\nedit: for those of you saying ware or fisher, are there any reasons in particular you guys are saying one over the the other?",

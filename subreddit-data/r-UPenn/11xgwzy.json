    "postText": "I would really like to be a software engineer after graduation and unfortunately have had no luck getting an swe internship this summer. I at least have a data science internship for this summer which is nice, but I\u2019m not as interested in data science. \n\nI would love to get some experience working as a swe in a professional setting  in order to set me up for summer 2024 internships and recruiting for jobs (I graduate spring 2025).\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone has done a fall swe internship while in school here and where you happened to do it at. Any advice would be appreciated!",

Am I missing something here? \n\nThanks!",

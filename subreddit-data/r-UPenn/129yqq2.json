            "comment": "Harvard don\u2019t think twice. Applied math doesn\u2019t exist at Penn. The math major is overly theoretical and the stat concentration is a sorry excuse for a technical degrees. You\u2019re best bet is the engineering school, which brings with it far too much work for it to be worth it for you. Penn also deflates pretty hard and can be sometimes toxic, but the social scene is pretty epic. Regardless, I\u2019m of the opinion that if you find your people you can have fun nearly anywhere (within reason). Yale shouldn\u2019t even be in the conversation here.",

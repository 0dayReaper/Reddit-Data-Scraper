    "postText": "Do courses that are from other undergraduate schools (like CIS, STAT, etc) count toward CAS cu if they are part of the major requirements? For instance Mathematical Economics has options for ESE, CIS, and STAT courses to fulfill the MathEcon major reqs, but would taking those classes as a MathEcon have them count toward the required CAS cu?\n\nI found some info on the CAS website but im not sure if it answers my question\n\n\"Because the Bachelor of Arts degree is fundamentally an Arts and Sciences curriculum,\u00a0students are required to complete a minimum number of c.u. in the Arts &amp; Sciences across the entire degree including [General Education](https://www.college.upenn.edu/gen-ed),\u00a0[minor](https://www.college.upenn.edu/minors-list),\u00a0\u00a0[major](https://www.college.upenn.edu/majors),\u00a0and\u00a0[Elective\u00a0](https://www.college.upenn.edu/electives)requirements.\n\n\"Courses in the Bachelor of Arts Degree are considered Arts and Sciences c.u. if they are:\n\n* Courses offered by a department or program in the School of Arts and Sciences (with the exception of courses for the BAAS program)\n* Courses in the\u00a0Communication Program in the Annenberg School\n* Advanced placement credits given by the above departments and programs\n* Transfer and away credits given by the above departments and programs\n* Non-Arts &amp; Sciences courses used in the [General Education requirements](https://www.college.upenn.edu/gen-ed) or non-Arts &amp; Sciences courses that are cross listed with an Arts &amp; Sciences undergraduate department or program.\u00a0 They can be identified by the \u201cCollege 16 CU (AU16)\u201d attribute in [Path@Penn](https://path.at.upenn.edu/).\u00a0\"",

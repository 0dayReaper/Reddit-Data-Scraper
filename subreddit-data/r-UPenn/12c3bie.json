It's stupid to think that Penn being a part of an athletic conference makes it super relevant in diverse areas of research. A lot of schools aren't considered elite overall but some of their programs are incredibly competitive and well reputed. Take Gatech for example, they are so behind overall but have incredibly strong departments in a lot of Engineering Fields. It's definitely harder to get into Gatech CSE than UPenn CIS.\n\nThe people hiring at elite companies would be incredibly dumb if all they cared about was a label. Also, how do people put Harvard and Princeton with Penn lol? UPenn isn't an Elite School, it's just an Ivy. Stanford and MIT are elite but not really Ivy.

Places like MIT are probably really up high for all of these but that's not true for UPenn. I was one of those people who was looking for places to apply for a PhD in Condensed Matter Physics, and Penn isn't even in top 20. Penn being a top school in Physics is almost definitely wrong. You'll see places like UIUC and Maryland ranked way above it.\n\nBiomedical research and Penn Medicine are incredibly strong departments, I agree. But that's an area, we have a strong forte in, which is not generally true for all other areas.\n\nAcceptance rate isn't a great standalone metric to determine how good a program is. Penn is definitely famous and a lot of people apply here. Doesn't mean that the average applicant is actually very good. Penn's Physics department is also pretty small so obviously it doesn't have a huge intake.\n\nUPenn is not an elite school, it's an Ivy! And in my honest opinion, in STEM research there are no elite schools, there are elite departments.\n\nPS: The fact that people are downvoting me for stating something without actually showing the stats or data for it is saddening.",

If you are talking about business and finance, Wharton at Penn is pretty strong and has its own reputation independent of the Penn Ivy context. Although, arguably even that label won't take you as infinitely far as you claim.\n\nIn STEM fields, Penn is nowhere as superior. Our career fairs themselves show how bad the scene is. Rarely, you see top employers come here. I would say it's just a terrible idea to see brands and labels in grad schools or even research.\n\nIn academia, things become even more blurry. So many influential researchers are spread everywhere. They themselves make and break entire departments. You will see Fields medallists and Nobel Laureates in places like UCLA, UChicago.\n\nEver since, I have come here I am becoming increasingly annoyed on how inflated an average Penn student's ego is. It's not a big deal, geez!  \n\n\nPS: I know most career fairs aren't the best way to get jobs. But my point was to show how much value Penn's STEM programs hold for recruiters.",

It seems more like a justification to why people spend thousands of dollars on them. Penn is certainly one of the best schools for some fields like Medicine. But for a lot of STEM fields it's actually not deservedly better than a lot of non Ivies. Not all Ivies are elite now. Some have fallen down in rankings. \n\nReading more about this culture, it seems to me Ivy League schools were more like an attempt to preserve capitalism. A way to ensure that the rich people study and make connections with other rich/competent people so as to come across good opportunities and stay rich. It only makes sense to also have some people work really hard and get scholarships to study here. And while people are growing out of it, it still holds true in some fields, I guess. Coming from STEM though, I have a different perspective on it. \n\nEven in my earlier comment, I said that for undergrad, it actually might be worth it also because Penn Neuro is actually very good!",

Penn CS grads, from a program which you assess to be not as good as UMich, make more than CS grads at any other school in the country.

All funding is need based and the average student pays like $25k. All of these everyone are based on YOUR friends. But an undergrad program with a 5% acceptance and a master's program with like an 80% acceptance are completely different worlds.\n\nThat being said, even based on those subject rankings, which have very shallow criteria and basically only measure the size of the department, Penn still ranks like top 15 in stem fields. But importantly, are you really gonna convince me that Penn CS which has like 200 people in intro CS with a 1:15ish TA ratio is worse in CS than Berkeley which has 1200-1400 people in their intro class with 1/triple digit TA ratios, just because they have more research professors.",

It's entirely possible that for undergrads, the strength of their department isn't as important. That being said I feel top undergrads in universities with a stronger department have a slight edge on doing some great research.\n\nSo Penn doesn't have scholarships that are based on merit. But is there no way possible for people to get into Penn without actually being deserving? Is merit the only criteria to get in Penn? Penn is also really expensive. Do you not know of smart people who priortize learning debt-free or aren't as rich?Also, my point isn't to demean Penn's undergrads. It was to convey that while it's hard to get in here, it isn't the end of the world.\n\nThere are no scholarships for master's students as well, that I know of. We don't even have need based grants. I understand Master's programs are obviously inferior in terms of quality and my observations were not based on that. Although, the acceptance rate for Master's programs are definitely not that high which again I feel does not tell you how inferior they are.\n\nFinally, what they mean to say by department size has almost nothing to do with the number of undergrads. Department rankings are often compared on the volume and quality of research output. Undergrads usually have very little to do with it. More number of professors working in your field definitely becomes more advantageous when you plan to do research yourself. Also, Penn's rankings on all STEM fields is diverse. There are certainly areas where Penn is not in top 20. Often, a lot of non Ivies are probably above us even when we are ranked amongst top 15.\n\nRegarding classes, I feel the class material covered is mostly the same and the professors who teach them are great in both the cases as well. How much do you think the TA/Student ratio matters?",

The huge hospital within campus limits and the UROP program for research allow you to have ample opportunities to grow your resume. If you\u2019re planning to pursue more of a consulting or untraditional neuroscience route, maybe penn is the best fit. Talk to your family, but in my opinion go with the option that puts the lowest amount of financial burden on you/family. Best of luck",

UMich deserves its recognition as a top public school, but if you are asking head to head which university is better, it's no contest for UPenn.\n\nA piece of unsolicited advice: it's good to have a field of interest in mind, but don't pigeonhole yourself into one track too quickly. One of the most valuable things about these formative years is the access and exposure to a wide range of career options.\n\nEvery year, countless students switch tracks. Premed to CS, engineering to consulting, poly sci to biology, the list goes on and on. It's hard to know what you truly want to do without a ton of exposure yet. \n\nPick an institution that will open doors for you no matter what you might end up doing. A harder question will be how much of a cost differential justifies attending UPenn once your financial aid comes back.",

            "comment": "I will start with Neuroscience at Penn, but with a cautionary note that many undergraduates change their majors before end of sophomore year.  Penn's neuroscience major is really special and there are related majors and minors such as computational neuroscience, cognitive science and others that you might be interested in too depending upon how your journey evolves.  If I were in your position, I would go to both schools departmental sites to look at the research they are doing and faculty and see what undergrads are doing etc.  Neuro is also a great match for those that are pre-med or want to keep that option (but I assume that is the same a Michigan) because there are several overlapping courses for the neuro major that are pre-med requirements. There is a yearly symposium for undergrads to demonstrate their research (you would do at least a senior thesis).  There are plenty of ongoing neuroscience research projects and labs both a part or affiliated with Penn within walking of the dorms.  There are related institutes and clubs to join that can be rewarding - from societies, to mental health advocacy etc...  (you can look them up). The new multibillion dollar Penn Hospital facility (essentially on campus) has a cutting edge neurology wing/section.  There are PHD's and MD/PHD's teaching novel neuro classes at Penn and researchers teaching freshman seminars who do well-regarded neuro-related research.  Putting aside the perception and prestige of an Ivy League school, which is important to some and rightly or wrongly, can help a career,  I think you should do the basics; which school has the better living and learning environment for you (campus setting, location, weather, etc.).  Will you be able to afford it (which is also a complicated question). I have a child that is graduating this year and majored in neuroscience which used to be called BBB (biological basis of behavior or something of that nature) and this graduate is extremely happy about his/her choice.  If you wanted to DM me, I could share the ups and downs for his/her journey but in the end, this student is extremely happy about what he or she learned and the opportunities he or she has now. Michigan is a world class school and I don't think it is fair to say one is \"better\" than the other.  It truly depends upon who you are and what is right for you. Penn is a spectacular urban campus, situated on what I would describe as a huge, mostly flat rectangle.  The core of that rectangle is mostly filled with students, teachers and staff most of the time, but as you go toward the perimeter of the triangle, you have busy open city areas like Market Street, the Hospital Center, Hotel's and on the Eastern Edge, Franklin Field and the Palestra (I still love these iconic places).  These outer edges have more of a pure city-feel with all the benefits (restaurants, cultural events) and detriments (higher crime as compared to suburban and rural campuses).  Hopefully you will or have visited both campuses.  Great choices, good luck.",

The university \"agreed\" to pay them the Michigan minimum living wage, but then made individual departments pay that extra wage themselves. The departments aren't all equipped to pay that extra wage difference, so the grad students aren't getting the wage the school promised. \n\nJust two cents on how UMich treats their students. I know you're a ugrad, but the schools attitude towards students does not change *that* much between ugrads and grads. Also just an fyi that the \"research\" you may see happening at UMich at this moment in time are heavily influenced by that strike.",

Statistically, you can see the acceptance rate of all Penn pre meds to med schools which is very high, something generally over 80% (I think it was 86% recently but would need to go back and check). Its very high compared to the rest of the country, but never compared to Mich. The average MCAT for those accepted 2 years ago at Penn was a 517 (which is a wow figure, to me).  Penn's core pre-med classes are tough (orgo in particular) so you might very well find it easier to get As at Michigan, but I doubt the statistics will prove that Mich. pre-meds are more successful in getting into Med school.  If the OP is interested in pre-med, he or she should look at these statistics carefully.  And according to some other sources I have looked at (pre-med advising firms) Penn and other ivies will give you a slight gpa advantage as compared to a student attending say a state college, whether fair or unfair.",

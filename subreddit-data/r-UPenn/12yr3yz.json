            "comment": "if you take painting 1 with ivanco, he's very nice and encouraging - but he does expect you to put time in your projects (at least 6 hours on the weekends)\n\nas someone in engineering, I thought i could take painting p/f and not have to worry about it.  But instead, I felt obligated to spend enough time working on all of my pieces that I think this class stressed me out more than my major-related classes.  I realized halfway through the semester I was putting in too much time and effort to only get a p/f grade from this and switched it to letter grading system.  Got an A, and it's probably my most enjoyable class to date, but it sure was not stress free for me",

If you\u2019re gifted artistically it\u2019ll still be work but it\u2019ll feel fine, if you\u2019re - as my TA said - \u201cclearly analytically minded\u201d it\u2019ll be hard (you still won\u2019t get lower than a B+ if you put in effort).",

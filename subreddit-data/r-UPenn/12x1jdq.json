    "postText": "Basically the title. How does the waiver work? I wanna use the AP micro and macro waivers, and I figure that means I\u2019d just bump into a more advanced econ class. But what does that entail for the required number of course units for the graduation requirement (econ major at cas). I know I wouldn\u2019t get any c.u.s, but if I waived the intro econ classes with my ap waivers, what would I do about the c.u.s i would have otherwise gotten from econ 0100 and econ 0200? would I have to fill the cu requirement with other electives?",

If you waive 100/200, you will need to replace them with higher level courses.\n\n&gt;And do you have to use the waivers if you send in your AP scores?\n\nNo",

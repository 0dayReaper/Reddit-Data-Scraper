            "comment": "Depends if you\u2019re actually interested in conducting research and will go through with it.\nTheir main thing is that student research is independent, so it\u2019s a lot of work outside of school and you can\u2019t use the research for a class paper or a thesis. They pride themselves on enabling students to pursue interests otherwise difficult or impossible to research at Penn. So if a lab on campus or a professor is researching something similar to what you want to do, they will not accept your project. \n\nBut it\u2019s perfect if you have a niche field of interest for which you need a lot of funding (like travel, housing, etc) to research. If you\u2019re in STEM, you will find a great community of researchers and mentors who can help you pursue something only you are interested in. Humanities is less represented i believe. You do have participation requirements like going to a lunch research presentation once/twice a month. I find them all really interesting tbh.. \n\nThe biggest advantage is the network of mentors, flexibility, and the funding they give you. Out of all Penn grants they go up to 5k per project, which is way higher than the usual 1-2k. That\u2019s a whole summer project, and possibilities r endless. Plus this much funding always looks good on a resume. If you use it wisely and uniquely, it can be an amazing experience. Dm me happy to chat about it",

I'm in nursing school and the only research I really want to conduct is LGBTQ+ related, just simple stuff. \n\nI will share this with my friends who also got admission who are more keen on STEM research",

Some people never end up proposing anything and still attend events and consider themselves University Scholars. It\u2019s defo a good opportunity, u don\u2019t lose anything",

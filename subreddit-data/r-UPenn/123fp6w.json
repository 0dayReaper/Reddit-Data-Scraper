Most of the people in my cohort could say the same. Obviously having publications helps, but I wouldn\u2019t assume this is a necessity. \n\nThough I can see this varying my discipline but from what I\u2019ve seen, the overwhelming majority of my grad school colleagues in social science and humanities departments did not arrive to grad school with publications. After all, the purpose of grad school is to teach you how to produce research articles.",

    "postText": "Hello, Tuesday is my first day working ( work-study) but both me and my supervisor are new to workday so any help will be greatly appreciated! Can anyone kindly explain how workday works such as how to enter the time worked? Do we need to sign in once and sign out once or do both at the end of the end? What to do with lunch break, do we must include in tracking or we can skip it over and do a whole time period of shift? Thank you so much and I greatly appreciate any other advice for first time user\ud83d\ude4f",

You don\u2019t really need to do it every day. \n\nAs for lunch break, you can mark time from like 8-12, give the \u201cOut\u201d reason as lunch break, then mark down like 1-5 or however else you worked. Feel free to reply or dm me if this didn\u2019t make sense or you want further clarification!",

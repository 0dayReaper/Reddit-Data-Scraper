My fin aid for penn wasn\u2019t so good (&amp; I have a scholarship for Rice), but would there be a significant difference between the two uni\u2019s in terms of a pre-med experience? I\u2019ve heard about the borderline toxicity of pre-med at Penn, but was hoping to get some more insight from a current student :)",

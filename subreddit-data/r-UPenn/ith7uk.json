            "comment": "HYPS and MIT are generally considered to be the top 5 national universities/colleges and toughest to get into and probably still are.  What is surprising is that Stanford has not been in that top 5 in the US News ranking for a while and is no 6 this year.  On the flip side Columbia is no. 3.  I wonder if MIT but more significantly Cal Tech should be ranked above elite schools with broader and expansive excellence across all disciplines but I understand either point of view.  Other than Columbia being ranked over Yale  (and perhaps MIT being ranked over Yale -closer call) I really have no problem with the list which is  really not that meaningful if you are fortunate enough to attend the top 10-20 of these schools.  I have no idea where these applaud emojis came from and it either a dumb mistake or bad humor... but it doesn't bother me.  I can see Penn being ranked anywhere between 6 and 10 depending upon your priorities and anywhere in the top 12 is terrific.  Any lower than that for Penn, I would have an issue.  I believe Penn has many solid top 5 and top 10 subject concentrations and is in the top 20 in almost all major disciplines with major interdisciplinary opportunities and research opportunities galore.  The business and medical schools are always in that top 5 tier as is nursing and the graduate programs are strong across the board.  Penn is doing just fine.  This year they put more negative emphasis on student debt and I hope that is not the reason why Penn lost a couple of notches.  But I have not looked into this so I am not sure what the reason is.",

In the end, this pandemic is a HUGE problem and has enormous financial repercussions for all universities.  I can completely understand wanting to put your resources into the students whose research and clinical and lab experiences have been eradicated by this filthy pandemic. But, it should show all of us that this is serious, not only in its health effects but in its effect on education!  Penn is probably not going to be able to do things like pay PILOT (payments in lieu of taxes) to help fix the Philly school system or to fund all the social or other absolutely righteous causes that may need attention at this time.  Penn is your educational institution and needs to be generous but this generosity must be to provide undergraduate and graduates students with the college experience and training and financial aid that are part of Penn's core values.  I argue that Penn should begin to figure out how alternative and cost effective on campus experiences beyond four years should be made available to Penn students that are having multiple semesters diluted by this pandemic.  During this time, we should be asking Penn to use its vast endowment for educational purposes for those adversely affected by the pandemic.  If there is ever a time to break the piggy bank a little, it is now.  If you want to go up in the rankings respond to this pandemic by steadfastly holding on to what Penn does well, educate scholars by committing to a real on-campus and affordable experience, even if drawn out or provided over several summer sessions, so that Penn students can truly go out  in the world to use knowledge, hopefully for good.",

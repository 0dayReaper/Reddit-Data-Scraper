    "postText": "* They want us to come back to campus, but it depends on the situation (on testing availability, contact tracing, treatment availability, etc. )\n* Four possible situations they're considering for the fall, some of which could be combined:\n   * Smaller classes (&lt;25 people) will meet in person with distancing/protective measures implemented. Larger classes will meet online even if you're staying on campus.\n   * The semester will be in person until Thanksgiving and will be online for the rest of the semester. Some classes might add more meeting times because of this.\n   * An increase in Summer 2021 course offerings\n   * An entirely online fall semester\n* Undergrad/grad/professional situations are likely to be different\n* Effects on campus life, if we end up on campus:\n   * We would be expected to wear masks, practice social distancing, avoid large gatherings\n   * We should be prepared to be regularly tested, self-report symptoms and work remotely\n   * The availability of regular testing is very important\n   * Travel to/from Philly would be discouraged, if you have to travel you'd have to self-isolate when you get back\n   * Less students in dorms\n   * Limiting hours/the number of people allowed in at once for high-traffic locations (libraries, Pottruck)\n   * Dining halls/nearby retail could have a take-out/pick-up system\n* They're planning to resume research in phases, starting with priority research",

But the biggest one IMO: describing it as \"getting ahead of the second wave\" makes no acknowledgement of the impact that university decisions have on strengthening and precipitating this second wave. It reads as if \"second waves\" are something that are wholly independent of what universities do, which is untrue. Opening universities and then sending kids back home will undoubtedly make any second wave come faster and stronger and will cause unneeded death. Early research (https://twitter.com/danielmangrum/status/1263513039397101568) has shown what a large impact travel of college-aged people had on Covid deaths two months ago.",

I don't see how any form of having students on campus is going to be effective at containing a virus. I think the best compromise the university can make is to strongly reduce the density of students on campus to only those who need to do labs and clinicals, but otherwise, even holding small seminars doesn't really make sense to me, unless they're holding 7 people seminars in large lecture halls where students can actually distance themselves. But then that just removes the point of having intimate seminar environments... \n\nI'm also highly doubtful the US will be able to achieve correct testing capacity, and if they do, I kind of doubt universities are high priority for testing availability.",

Why is Penn being so persistent about re-opening campus? What are international students who can\u2019t get visa processed and have to find a place to quarantine for 14 days gonna do? What will happen to members of the community with weak immune system? I don\u2019t see the point of taking online classes on-campus.

If they\u2019re being asked to teach in person and virtual classes, all of the virtual classes are going to be absolute trash. Give professors the time now to develop their classes to adapt to virtual learning rather than having them figure out how to do both.",

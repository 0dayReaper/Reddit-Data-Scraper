I can't seem to find the right info on this to help me answer this q.\n\nI know that external transfers can't internally transfer to a diff college once enrolled at Penn, but I can't seem to figure out if double majors are not allowed across colleges. \n\nIf anyone has the answer to this or could help, please do lmk! Ty :)",

For any other major from SEAS you need to apply to do a dual with SEAS. Although, all students in SEAS are allowed to do any major in CAS without transferring and they do not need to do the CAS General Requirements. This is the easiest way to do a major in SEAS and a major in CAS because the application to transfer to SEAS is easier and you don't have to take as many classes",

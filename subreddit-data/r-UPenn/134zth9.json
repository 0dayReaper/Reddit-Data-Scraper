    "postText": "Hi! Is Derenoncourt really that bad at teaching and organising his course in comparison to the other DSGN professors? I'm hoping to take DSGN0010 in the fall just to learn more about design and balance out some hardo classes like econ &amp; cis etc with creativity, so I'm not necessarily fazed by his work required rating being harder than the other professors, but I'm concerned a little by the 2.07 ratings.... \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h08fhdxa1axa1.png?width=2784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d64784a84c1e23924a3502bfe21545b37ffe542",

Don't know if he will, so you may have to ask around, but he's super helpful when it comes to student questions, a chill professor who genuinely cares about what he teaches, and overall just pleasant to learn from. \n\nBut that's a low rating for Derenoncourt. I hope someone else has insights as to why. Good luck!",

This is really offensive, and I\u2019m going to send an email to admin asking for a public apology for the \u201capathy, thoughtlessness, and general disrespect showed toward the most vulnerable members of the student body in the midsts of an unprecedented spike in cases in the midsts of an unprecedented global pandemic.\u201d \n\nThis tasteless response demonstrates how the Penn administration continues to be prejudiced against the less privileged members of our community, and as an alum, I am disappointed that the \u201cinnate talents\u201d of our administration could not be put to better use than shaming undergraduates for circumstances out of their control. I would recommend that this email be added to the writing seminar curriculum, so that no Penn student graduates thinking this kind of email is appropriate to send.",

            "comment": "I was deciding between these two iPads and ended up going with the 12.9 inch pro. It is heavier, but I like the bigger screen because I often use the multitasking/split screen feature in landscape mode to take notes next to lecture slides or the e-textbook. I also use my laptop for the e-textbook or lecture slides while having my notes up on my iPad next to my homework so I can see everything while doing the problems. The 12.9\u201d looks massive compared to the 11\u201d but it\u2019s been a lifesaver for me. I am a stem major and i only use my ipad and laptop, i do not take any notes or complete any homework on paper. \n\nI am someone who likes a big screen though (i also have the pro max iphone). Most people have the smaller ipad. Just personally for me, i like using multitasking while studying or doing problem sets. I carry around this ipad and the 14\u201d macbook pro. It does get heavy but it\u2019s not terrible.",

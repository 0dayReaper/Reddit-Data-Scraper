    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm an incoming sophomore transfer student at Penn planning on studying the Political Economy concentration in the Poli Sci department.\n\nThis summer, I started a finance internship with a local startup, and it's gotten me really interested in the field of management consulting and other finance roles. I know Penn is *the* place to be when it comes to these types of fields, and was wondering if anyone could offer me some advice regarding the following questions:\n\n1. I'm aware that consulting firms often recruit from a variety of majors and backgrounds, and I've already come into contact with Political Science majors landing MBB offers; however, when it comes to advanced Finance roles such as IB, PE, or even Asset Management, I've heard recruiting can be quite tough without a Finance-related major; please let me know what your thoughts on this are!\n2. If I were to pursue a career in Management Consulting, what sorts of internships should I be seeking for Summer 2024 (summer after my sophomore year), given that I have never had prior consulting experience. I intend on applying for several of Penn's premier consulting clubs and I hope to land an MBB internship for Summer 2025, so some insight into what I could do in Summer 2024 would be greatly appreciated!\n3. In terms of Finance, I know Finance internship recruiting is much more brutal than that for Management Consulting; I was wondering if I would be considered \"late to the game\" if I somehow wanted to start a career in Finance and land an Investment Banking internship for Summer 2025 (since recruiting for top banks usually start in Feb. 2024) &lt;-- I could also be completely wrong on this, please correct me if I am. If I *do* have time, how should I prepare for a Finance career in the absence of a Finance education?\n\nThanks for all of the help everyone! Please feel free to PM me or just comment on this post -- can't wait for all the great advice!",

You are forever stuck in CAS, babe.  \n\nReally hope you didn't blindly accept your admission offer without any research.",

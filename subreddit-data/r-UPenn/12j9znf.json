    "postText": "Hi guys, \n\nHas anyone ever taken ENM375 with Dr. Vadim Markel? I have a final exam for this class, but am unsure how to prepare, and he said that the textbook problems were not helpful. Does anyone have any old resources (i.e., old exams, notes, practice tests) that helped when they took this class if they are comfortable sharing? I'm grateful for any reply.\n\nThanks!",

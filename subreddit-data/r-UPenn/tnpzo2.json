    "postText": "In an undisclosed room inside College Hall, SPEC committee members are gathered around a table, about to discuss the 2050 Spring Fling lineup. On the dimly lit wall behind the committee chair sits a framed comment from u/chemtiger8: \"People say this \\[the lineup is bad\\] every year lol, can't please everyone.\" \n\n\"First thing's first,\" someone chimes in, \"we should set the price for tickets.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we make them free for students, or at least somewhat cheap, I feel like that would make sense,\" another member answers.\n\n Immediately, this member was voted off of SPEC, held back two years, and unrecruited from Goldman Sachs. Quickly after, the committee voted on a price of $250, lowered to $240 before the lineup reveal, with an extra $3 off anyone who followed SPEC on Instagram. This price might seem high to the (unknowing and ignorant) everyday undergrad, but what they don't understand is that every member at the table was currently off two tabs and a gummy, which obviously don't pay for themselves. This was a fairly recent rule, set by the 2022 committee, who had collectively experienced ego death after Temple was able to get Jack Harlow for their fling (this part is real).\n\n\"Now for the lineup - I was thinking maybe we could use the extra ticket funds to get someone like Doja Cat or Drake?\" one member asks. Right after she finished her sentence, the entire room erupted into hysterical laughter.\n\n\"But then how are we supposed to afford our suite room at the Super Bowl??\" another member quips in between two chuckles. \"Regardless, those two were relevant in 2022 - we need people who fell off 10 more years before that at a minimum.\"\n\nA week later, in a far away geriatrics room at HUP, the krr-huhh of a ventilator can be heard. In the hospital bed was Amy Gutmann, who, after falling ill from the Covid-**\u03a0\u039a\u0391** variant, had been extradited from Germany in 2030 by the student government to act as a puppet president. Gutmann, now 101, laid unresponsive as the SPEC member sitting beside her read out the pre-written email announcing this year's lineup: Riff Raff ft. an 84 year old Elvis impersonator.",

    "postText": "Recently a bunch of girls I know (myself included) have encountered this one guy who has asked us all out in practically the exact same way. It's happened in a bunch of different locations on campus (locust walk, coffee shops, acme). He's come up to us and complemented something we have (jacket, backpack, shoes), ask a couple questions about us (name, major, class year), and ask us out by saying something along the lines of, *\"Well I'm going to be honest here, I saw you from far away and thought you were gorgeous, and I was wondering if I could get your number so I can ask you out.\"*\n\nIf you say no, he starts to say things like \"Oh now I'm so embarrassed\", \"This is so embarrassing\", \"I'm such an idiot\", which often made whatever girl he was talking to be reassuring and apologetic to him (I was anyways).\n\nI found out recently that this exact sequence of events has happened to a **lot** of girls with the same guy (he says he's either in med school or a senior, but it's unclear if he's a Penn student). I found the whole experience and everything around it to be weird and uncomfortable. I wanted to make a post here about it to make other girls on campus aware of this. Please be safe guys.",

There\u2019s a big difference between if you walk up to a girl once to ask her out vs if you do this to multiple girls per day. While I thought it was fine for him to initially come up, it\u2019s the fact that so many girls have had this exact experience that makes it feel wrong. Asking someone out in person at random isn\u2019t common, so when it happens it can make someone feel special or flattered. This changes if you then find out that this guy just does it for every girl he sees. It feels manipulative, like he doesn\u2019t actually care about the girl, he just wants to find some girl.\n\nOn top of that, I think the fact he starts to berate himself like \u201coh how embarrassing\u201d and whatever else is also kinda messed up. He\u2019s done this a dozen times\u2014if he was actually embarrassed, he should stop. Instead, I think he does this to either 1) get the girl to change her mind or 2) get the girl to apologize to him and feel bad (even though she did not ask to be asked out, and there\u2019s no reason to feel bad).\n\nedit: Some ppl have reach out to me that he actually did continue to persist them even after showing that they had no interest, forcing the conversation to continue. e.g. one girl was on locust, he came up to her, and when she realized he wasn't undergrad, tried to leave but he wouldn't stop asking her questions so she was stuck in the conversation. It's that type of behavior that also makes girls uncomfortable.",

I agree that it could be flattering and even somewhat romantic in the rare situation that a \"good\" guy feels compelled to approach a girl due to something that catches his eye, which could be more than just looks.  But clearly, this is not what is gong on and the disingenuous nature of his subsequent actions shows his colors.  I am sorry you went through this experience.  When I was at Penn, and this is truly terrible, the boys in the frat houses used to randomly cat call and approach women walking down Locust and this was a huge issue on campus that caused numerous conflicts between women's organizations and the frats.  Things have improved that way for sure  (and probably not enough) but what will never go away are jerks --some guys are just jerks and unfortunately some are even worse than that!

He is just some nerd who read a self-help book/post somewhere online about facing your fears. He was not predatory at all and if anyone is scared of him he is so harmless. I'm a medium-framed girl but I definitely could have knocked him to the ground in a heart beat. He is just a nervous little nerd tbh. For some fact checking, I know the following about him (I am super talkative so I found out a lot): He's from California, went to UCSB for undergrad, and is a 4th year at Perelman (I also know his name but I won't put it publicly ofc). Now all this could be lies, and to me then that would be considered a problem. I genuinely don't think it's that deep and just feel sorry for him because he is just trying his best. I wouldn't read so much into it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bigger issue: I got covid a few days after speaking to this guy...no one else around me has it so I blame this asshole.",

I would be extremely uncomfortable if some random guy came up to me when I'm just minding my own business, walking or sitting somewhere on campus, and asked for my contact information. Also, why did you list the gym? Obviously, you shouldn't be hitting on people at the gym. They're not there to get hit on; they're there to work out. As a woman, I'm already self conscious about men ogling me during my workout. Having some dude hit on me when I'm trying to work out is just not okay. The fact that you think it's okay to ask for people's numbers at the gym just feels like a red flag to me. Also, just because something used to be normalized doesn't mean that it's okay.",

You should be more concerned about potentially making people uncomfortable than the low chance that you'll find a date from hitting on random women in public. If you think that being uncomfortable with creepy men ogling me and hitting on me at the gym when I'm just minding my own business is unique to myself and my friends, you need to get out of your own bubble and learn to empathize with women. Even if a woman doesn't react outwardly negative to your advances, that's more likely an attempt to avoid making you angry so that you don't attack/verbally harass her (unfortunately, many women have been harassed or even killed after rejecting men's advances). I'm not sure how you plan on having a relationship with someone when you don't care whether you make people uncomfortable. \n\nI'm not saying not to talk to people if you're polite and genuinely interested in learning about them and becoming friends (if they don't seem busy and are open to the conversation), but walking up to a woman in a space where it isn't normal to approach people with romantic interest because you find her sexually attractive (which is really the only kind of attraction you could have to someone you haven't even met) and talking to her with the intention of obtaining her contact information so you can potentially date/fuck her is creepy.",

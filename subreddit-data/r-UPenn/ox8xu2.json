I want to go to classes, I want to go to parties, I want to perform, and I want to enjoy just one normal year of college. That\u2019s not selfish to ask. The selfish people are the ones who deliberately aren\u2019t getting vaccinated despite being eligible and frankly it\u2019s not our responsibility to indulge stupidity.\n\nThis whole situation is making me feel so hopeless. This is never gonna end.",

You think the only people you\u2019re going to interact with in West Philly are Penn students and faculty? Where are those parties you want to go to? Where do you shop? Where do you go out to eat? I get that everyone is emotional and stressed, but please think this the whole way through before you act on any of these feelings you\u2019re having.\n\nMy point is that if the ADULTS we're interacting with at restaurants, stores, and anywhere else that we go are not vaccinated despite every PSA telling them to (even goddamn Mitch Mcconnell) and every public resource at their disposal to get the shot, then they have exercised their right to live with the potential of contracting COVID at their own risk. What more can we do for those people but hope for the best? I don't wish death, but I don't think it's our responsibility to act as if they're helpless when they've made the active decision to avoid being vaccinated.",

Please try and understand mine.\n\nI get that you don\u2019t feel like you have to care about those people. That\u2019s fine, that\u2019s whatever it is. But they exist, they *will* get sick, and there *will* be more restrictions unless the responsible among us make the effort. That\u2019s the careless part - that you\u2019re only thinking in the short term about your happiness over the next three months.\n\nE: I assume you\u2019re not going to reply to me, u/jack0223 but please consider the spread of the delta variant (that you acknowledged above) as well as the prof with unvaccinated children. The combination of those two points is exactly why we have to stay vigilant.",

It's awful that people can be so selfish to others. Maybe they don't care about Philly because they come from other cities they can go home to, while leaving a mess behind here. People need to be forced to act right with a mandate, but when it turns into a recommendation they act like it's no big deal to get others sick and that the vaccine protects everyone completely. And no, this won't be a normal academic year, no matter which angle you look at it from.",

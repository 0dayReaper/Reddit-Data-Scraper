    "postText": "I went to undergrad at a state school, got a degree in Biology, decided I didn\u2019t want to become a doctor and instead want to pivot to getting a software engineering job. I have no loans from undergrad. \n\nI got accepted to MCIT (basically a computer science degree) which costs 80k for two years. My parents can cover the living expenses for the two years, so I will be left with exactly 80k in debt which I will need to pay off myself. I am 100% sure I can get a 6 figure job out of graduation (especially bc my parent can refer me to the company they work at that pays about ~110k starting in Texas), but there\u2019s a huge range of what I could get depending on how good I am. I could get a job making anywhere from 100-200k+, but the 100k I\u2019m sure I could get while the top end is possible (assuming the CS market is back up by 2025) but unlikely. I already have some really good projects and stuff on resume, but I just need the formal education.\n\nMCIT also has an online option that is only ~30k which would be way more affordable, but people who do online MCIT cannot get access to the on campus career fairs and ig it could be harder to learn through online only.\n\nAnyone have any advice on handling student loans and determining what amount is too much and not worth it? Thoughts on on campus vs online to save money?\n\nMy goals are to work for the highest paying company I can out of my masters and ideally live with parents for a year so I can pay off most of my student loans before moving out.",

Having gone through the CS classes here I found that many of my classmates who did it solely out of the promise of high compensation tech careers suffered when reality turned out harder than a easy get rich quick scheme.\n\nIf you know you\u2019ll get the job go for the cheaper option. For my SWE position the company cared that I went to Penn as an undergrad but didn\u2019t even ask for my gpa or transcript. What was far more important for them was my previous work experience and projects that I had built.",

Spend 2.5 years in philly with your parents paying your living expenses, work full time (you can be like a parking attendant or work in dining or something like that).  Go to school to get your degree and come out with 0 debt and then just start your high paying job.",

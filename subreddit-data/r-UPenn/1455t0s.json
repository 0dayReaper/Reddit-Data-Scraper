    "postText": "I wanted to try \"Big Data, Big Responsibilities: The Law and Ethics of Business Analytics\" out this fall as an incoming freshman in CAS but the class is full according to Path.\n\nIf anyone here has taken the course, is this a good class to take during freshman fall? Did you enjoy the class? And is Werbach someone who is likely to let me into the class if I email him?\n\nALSO: what is the difference between 0.5 credit and 1 credit classes?",

            "comment": "You need to accumulate a certain number of credits to earn your degree (in CAS this depends on your exact major).  If a class awards 0.5 credit, it counts less than 1.0 credit.  Typically, Wharton 0.5 credit classes only meet for half the semester.  This particular class appears to meet for only 14 sessions (twice a week for seven weeks).\n\nThis course should be okay for any freshman.  Grading will be fairly relaxed.  Hell, the professor will accept multiple assignment formats.  Want to write an essay? Great!  Want to just do a PowerPoint or video instead?  You good.\n\nAnd how can we turn down a class in which watching BLACK MIRROR is a requirement?\n\nIf you have any doubts, I would just make use of office hours.... that's a great way to build/refine your ideas before producing graded work.  They're not going to grade their own ideas harshly :0)",

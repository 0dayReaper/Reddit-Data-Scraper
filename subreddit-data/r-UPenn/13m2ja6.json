There's also a homework which takes a few hours (3-5 hours), I think there's 10, so nearly every week. The homeworks are graded instantly with unlimited submissions and the late policy is pretty generous. There's two exams that are not particularly difficult and the class is also curved generously. Overall, probably one of the classes I've learnt most from at Penn, though if you've taken 545/520 there's a good chunk of redundancy.",

It\u2019s a beautiful woman,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been beautiful women in art history since the dawn of time, but this is atypical in that this is a beautiful woman of color.\u201d\u2019\n\n\nHahaha. Cool. It seems a little naive and misguided, but I think the school just took what it got without any real agency of their own, so I\u2019m not gonna pass judgment or anything. I get the sentiment, though, thank you",

Nobody is \"making\" this political; it was already political and those criticizing the move are concerned that this is performative and not a genuine attempt to improve the lives of black people in the Philadelphia community. The statue itself isn't the problem; the lack of meaningful action to accompany it is.",

    "postText": "What kinds of careers do people who choose the accounting concentration at Wharton usually pursue?  The website mentions the usual suspects: IB, consulting, general management etc but if you were going to go one of those routes wouldn't you just pick the finance concentration?  Or one of the others that is more applicable to general management and strategy?  Given how few Wharton students end up in accounting practice it just seems curious to me.",

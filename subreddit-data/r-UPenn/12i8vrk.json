Cash back has been significant too.\n\nIf you end up going with it, I\u2019d recommend trying to find a referral by someone already with it \u2014 it gives both of you a credit around $100 if I remember correctly.",

You can open up a checking account there and also try to get their Cash Back + card which gives 1.8% flat cash back on all purchases. Not the best credit card by any means, but pretty solid and it\u2019s quite convenient app wise if you have a Citizens checking account, too. \n\nGood luck!",

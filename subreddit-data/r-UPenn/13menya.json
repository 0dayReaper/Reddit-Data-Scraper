I\u2019m thinking about joining Alpha Kappa Psi but I don\u2019t know much about it other than that it\u2019s the largest business frat.",

Ended up dropping the business frat bc the preprofessional vibe made it very power politics based and cliquey imo\u2026 honestly you can get a lot of the same career/mentorship benefits from a business frat that you\u2019d get in a finance/consulting club.. and if you\u2019re just joining to meet some cool ppl, highly rec the social frat route",

All social frats have connections within the business industry and have older mentors that could help during recruiting. The main reason to join a business frat is if you genuinely like the people in them.",

You won\u2019t have to live in a house freshman or sophomore year because Penn requires you to live on campus (ex: hill, high rises).",

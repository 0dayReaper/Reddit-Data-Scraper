The mean and median were 90/120 and 94/120. \n\nMy homework average is a 95 right now and should stay the same until the end of the semester. No, I do not cheat. I have severe time-management issues. The 60 minutes of allocated exam time isnt enough for me. I missed half my exam (I am very slow).\n\nAm I fucked? If I keep the same performance as my midterms on the final, will I get a D? People who have taken this course, please comment.",

Bc it seems like you got most of the stuff correct you attempted, but the score makes it seem like you\u2019re completely lost compared to the rest of the class. Maybe you can even get approved for extra time if it\u2019s something behavioral / medical? Or, you\u2019ll just need to work on being faster (put yourself in that standardized testing situation where we all had to work overly fast in order to finish the tests).",

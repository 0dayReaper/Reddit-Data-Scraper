You should think of it as high school over again and that will help you succeed. The only things that matter is GPA, MCAT and getting that health professions office letter. The premed scene is the same everywhere: gunners and cut-throat.",

No offense, but as other Quakers mentioned, only an insecure student at the #10 university would feel the need to specify they're at a \"T10.\" Just say Northwestern; it's still elite and you seriously have nothing to be insecure about.\n3. If you're seriously more worried about premed \"culture\" (???) than you are about academic/research fit, opportunities to get involved with the West Philly community, et cetera ... *yikes*. Please get your priorities straight and go touch some grass -- for your own good, as well as the good of your future patients.\n4. Penn doesn't need (yet) another \"T10\"/prestige-chasing assh\\*le. If you're committed to your ways, please do us all a favor and stay at Northwestern.\n\nPS: As an alum, trust me -- grades aren't everything (in premed, at Penn, and in life)! Yes, 4.0/528's at Penn get rejected from med school.",

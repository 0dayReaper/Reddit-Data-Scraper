I would say your best guess is to use last year\u2019s return as a guide. If you make more, you\u2019ll get more back. As a dependent, you can\u2019t claim tax credits really (or large ones) which is what people with big returns sometimes get. It\u2019s about how much you\u2019re overpaying your actual taxes due. And in my experience, Penn is much better about estimating your taxes than other employers were in past jobs. Which means I just get less back compared to other jobs I\u2019ve worked. Typical tax dedications in my experience (depending on county, etc) are about 20% (from a PA native!).",

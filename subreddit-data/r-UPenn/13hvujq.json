There\u2019s honestly not much applied math in these courses (think 2 weeks of 2400 content at most in 2600).  Also like AssuasiveLynx said, take 1610 if you want to take 2600.  If you can commit a lot of time per week (at least 4 hours for the problem set, maybe up to 10 in total per week or even 15 on bad weeks) for 1610 and 2600, the grade is not something you need to worry about, but the other side is that you really don\u2019t get much guidance at all and the problem sets get a little bit crazy sometimes (topology, real analysis).",

Im leaning towards possibly testing out and going for 2400 in my first sem itself\u2026 what would be better doing the prep for 1410 and doing 1610 in my first sem or doing 1410 test and 2400? PS im not a math major, im doing econ at wharton and huntsman lol",

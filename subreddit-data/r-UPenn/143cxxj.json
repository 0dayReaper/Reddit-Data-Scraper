    "postText": "Hey Penn community,\n\nI am an incoming freshman at Penn and am a little lost in the process of preparing to select courses.  I wanted to post some questions here (College of Arts and Sciences btw).\n\n1. How many classes are you allowed to take your first semester?  Is it only 4?\n\n2. I was originally interested only in poli sci (IR) but now I am thinking of also exploring some classes in finance or business economics.  Is it possible to take these intro classes even if they aren\u2019t in the College?\n\n3. What do you all recommend as a good course pathway generally for freshman?  I know the curriculum is broad but I want to take a wide range of stuff while fulfilling requirements if possible.  I may consider going for a dual degree but I want to be in a position to have options.\n\nThanks for the help in advance!",

You can take classes from the other schools but be aware that you can only take a certain amount of non college classes that count for graduation\n3. This is too broad of a question imo. Think about what interests you and take a class. Then go from there! It's hard to fully figure out a pathway when you haven't even began college yet. For now, just take what you like :)",

Just submit a request saying you want to take so and so course and after Penn approves it, take the course and upon completion, send a transcript to your respective school at Penn. The process is pretty straightforward, but it took a longgg time for the XCAT staff to post my credit to my transcript.",

You go to XCAT and submit it under \u201ccredit away\u201d just makes rue you have the syllabus of the course and know the equivalent penn course. Then just wait to see if they approve it or not.",

            "comment": "Highly recommend. It\u2019s not super difficult just get it approved in XCAT first, sign up for the class at the other university, then send the transcript to Penn when you\u2019re done.\n\nIt\u2019s oftentimes way way cheaper plus you don\u2019t have to worry about grades as much since it doesn\u2019t factor into GPA. For most depts/classes I think you just needa get like a C or above to receive credit but don\u2019t quote me on that.",

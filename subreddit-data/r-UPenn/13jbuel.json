I remember reading that when Harvard had a cutoff, they once gave Latin honours to 80% of the class and henceforth capped it at 50% (something in between for Summa and Magna).\n\nPoint is, until otherwise stated, it's a cutoff",

If you're one of those unlucky souls with a 3.799, my sincerest condolences (but also, congrats, since Penn can be damn hard!).\n\nRegarding top x% -- in reality, nobody cares too much (incl. employers, grad schools, etc.). Totally understand being curious (who isn't?), but don't waste your time worrying about stuff like that. :P",

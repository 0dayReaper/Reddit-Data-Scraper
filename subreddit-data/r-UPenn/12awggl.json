    "postText": "not tryna waste your time. I'm very fortunate to have entered all of these colleges, and hope not to harm anybody's feelings if my takes seem a little condescending/ungrateful.\n\nI'm an international, I got into Berkeley EECs with regents scholarship, as well as Yale. I also got into the Jerome Fisher Programme(M&amp;T) at UPenn, which I believe is very similar to MET Berkeley.\n\nI'll be very blunt, I'm trying to make hella money after college or grad school. Initially, I had the idea of following the education plan of most billionaires(coupling an engineering degree with another business degree or MBA), but I'm definitely open to other options to financially succeed. I want to work a job that invites me to do something different everyday, to lead a team, to execute strategies, or to accomplish company goals. I don't mind it being in the office, I just don't want a job that wants me to do the same boring s\\*\\*t everyday(like accounting or software engineering). I want excitement, and I want to be in a leadership position.\n\nRight now, I'm really inclined to go to berkeley. The culture seems cohesive, everyone's there for a cause, the campus is relatively big, people are diverse. From the pictures and youtube videos online, it seems like the place to be, even if the classes are, or at least are exaggerated to be, demanding. From the rankings it seems like berkeley is premiere in engineering and cs. My question is whether it has a reputation as prestigious as yale and upenn in the work force, not just in california, but in the whole world(opinions from international students are much appreciated). With so many people on campus, is the alumni network excellent, or is it average? mediocre? Will I be able to forge long lasting ties with people at Cal?\n\nBig or small school to me doesn't matter. Cost doesn't matter. I do value my life outside of school, though I don't see how I could undergo loneliness or burnout in any of these colleges with so many resources at hand.\n\n**also, any criticism of berkeley about class availability, research with professors, and housing being difficult to find doesn't apply to me, since regents automatically get priority in these affairs**\n\nEveryone at school is telling me to go Yale or Upenn, which has made me realise just how powerful the names of these schools are. Berkeley, as much as its strong and I like it, isn't recieving that kind of respect in the international school I go to.\n\nWhat I love about yale, other than its prestige and reputation, is its incredible flexibility of classes as well as the tight knit bonds of its community. I have the impression that it's very studious(neither a pro or con for me), though also has a big element of work-hard play hard. The place seems like a vibe, though the engineering program seems a little dogs\\*\\*t. But again, its name may outweigh this discrepancy\n\nPlus the school is new haven, the middle of no where, and its 300 years old, so its buildings must be very ancient(I'm a big fan of modern buildings\n\nUpenn on the other hand, also seems like vibe. The name wharton seems massive in the money making industry. I love the modern campus. I know the business education is premiere, not so sure about the engineering department but I can imagine is still strong(maybe not at the level of Berkeley).\n\nif u need more info to give advice, let me know\n\nAny takes are much much valued.",

            "comment": "First off, congrats on these great acceptances\n\nI'm going to be very blunt. There is a huuugee disconnect between what you want and what the reality is. The only way to make \"hella money\" out of college is with your own money. No one is going to give you a leadership role + a 250k-1mil starting salary just because you got a degree from Penn or Cal EECS.\n\nThe only way to make \"hella money\" out of college is take the huge risk of starting your own tech/engineering venture or starting your own hedge fund. But, both require you putting in your own money. Not to mention, even startup life or trading on your account can become distasteful or boring. Any career has its boring sides. What you really wish is you were entering college before the 1970s when just getting an elite college degree opened big leadership roles and instant path to financial domination. That era is long gone.",

There are quants out of M&amp;T making easily into the 600-700 range, and some making 1 mil plus starting. A lot of banking positions get around 250 and if you can make it to quant it\u2019ll definitely put you over the edge, so that\u2019s the way you can make \u201chella money\u201d out of college (usually 2/3 M&amp;T\u2019s a year go to quant).\n\nI vote M&amp;T personally if money is not an issue, the small community is really great and you can get lucrative jobs by working hard enough. The biggest downside to M&amp;T is the course load preventing you from doing other things if you aren\u2019t careful with time management, but other than that, it\u2019s really amazing I think.",

I have a friend (2 years ex-Penn) at Jump as a VP and he's a quant and he is not making in that range, and he's been transparent with his friends about the whole quant world. There are PhDs and Managing Directors making in that range, and yes there will always be a 1%er under 28 year old in every shop who is making 600k because of a very good trade. People have extremely overblown understanding and expectations of high frequency trading. This is not the era of Renaissance Technologies when there were only a couple players. I can definitely say that Jane Street pays base 250-300k for certain starting roles and Citadel and Getco pays base 150-250k but you would be hard pressed to find companies paying 600k even with bonus for kids right out of college. Of course, if you stick to the industry by age 28-30, you will be making 600-1mil at Jane Street, Citadel or Getco, yes.",

For example, Rentech literally only hires PhDs since the Recession. Try to do a M&amp;T alumni search on Linkedin/Penn directory and you will see what I mean about Rentech. This is a well known fact in the industry and they don't even pay 7figs starting (but they do pay the highest after Virtu). You just happened to be having a Reddit discussion with a guy who has close family in this industry.\n\nno one in M&amp;T is getting a 7 fig offer out of undergrad in quant trading UNLESS he/she has made 7 figs investing in their private portfolio in the past and can prove it. there are people getting into Jane Street making 300k base and that is not even dominated by M&amp;T anymore than just your average SEAS student. In the quant world that you are imagining, it isn't about being great at math from a classes/GPA perspective, it is about citations on papers and how much you have contributed to math related research ... and there is at least one individual who graduated from Penn and moved back to China due to CCP connection and made 7 figs. his dad/uncle is actually very well known in the Asian industry and you might be able to easily find who it is if I just shared the firm.\n\nadvice: If something seems too good to be true.....",

My sister did her PHD at Berkeley in EECS. \n\nBerkeley is a wonderful school. They've got really great engineering there (world class in EECS). It's also a huge state school. I would imagine this makes it less personable to instructors. I'm not sure how great the instruction is (as it's a giant research university, so intro lecture classes with probs hit and miss). \n\nYale is not in the middle of nowhere. It's an easy train ride away from New York which costs \\~$20. Also, the buildings are not old haha. Most were all built in a 1930s as a shameless ripoff of Oxford/Cambridge architecture. They are super fun to explore have lots of amazing rooftops and steam tunnels. \n\nYale's community can be great, but can also be limiting. Residential colleges are wonderful if you click with a bunch of people in your dorm (I happened to), but not everybody does. \n\nYale CS/engineering is good, and people end up in FAANG all the time. Yale CS is super theoretical though (pretty much the entire school is). That means you will be spending your time doing C and proof-based math instead of learning whatever framework is hot (react/node/etc). \n\nMy experience at Penn is in a CS grad program (MCIT), so I can't really speak to campus culture that well. Grad school has been a lot more head down+studying versus actually meeting community people (but that's just me). \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAlso, like the commenter said... unless you invent the next Facebook, it will be very hard for you to make a boatload of money by yourself. I know a few people from Yale who did (maybe like 1-2 out of my whole class). They started companies and got acquired. \n\nThat's not to say you can't get rich. The rest of my class has/is getting rich in the more traditional sense. There are a few tracks:\n\n* CS Degree -&gt; FAANG\n* ECON Degree -&gt; IB Analyst at a bank -&gt; Private Equity (I know one guy who went right to PE, but that was pretty rare and he got pretty lucky).\n* ECON/Liberal Arts Degree -&gt; MBB Consulting -&gt; MBA -&gt; PE/Management \n* Liberal Arts -&gt; T14 Law School -&gt; White collar law firm\n\nThis of course is a gross oversimplification (I did not pursue any of these tracks haha. I went into law enforcement and had the time of my life). Money is definitely not every thing :)\n\nAnyways - best of luck, congratulations on your decision, and hope you make the right choice for you!",

            "comment": "First - congrats. It's quite an achievement. Here's my perspective as an M&amp;T who also got into Regents but in IEOR and very well connected with Cal people - I've since graduated my undergrad. I can't speak to Yale. Long-winded, but hopefully some helpful datapoints.\n\nStarting off - making \"hella money\", or being in a leadership position very early on is quite untenable - this is something that your receive over time. No educational opportunity will directly provide those benefits, barring entrepreneurial pursuits. This is something you should aspire to, but cannot guarantee with any measure based on a university. My advice - don't index on this, but instead on the culture and the network you receive. You will find that making money and job excitement comes naturally after the \"exploration\" phase you will find in college to find what you are interested in, and more importantly, what you are good at.\n\nFirst, Berkeley is actually more reputable than UPenn to the lay person in the US. Ironically, more people know Berkeley offhand. Your random person will think you go to Penn State rather than an ivy (this has happened more than you can count). The difference for UPenn is that **the people who you need to know about your college, will know it is more prestigious**. How do we know this? Consider many competitive such as consulting, IB, and other groups - the most prestigious office, the NY office, will almost never accept Cal students but will accept Penn students. But for SF office, it's mostly Cal (cuz their resume will be autorouted away if they choose for example SF and NY) and Penn students have no barriers (Penn makes up a strong population of IB, Consulting, PE, Quant across almost all cities and companies). (While this is not the sector u are interested in, it's a relevant datapoint to your question on prestige)\n\nSecond - For something like CS, I argue that prestige does **not** matter that much. Most of the evaluations are indeed indexed on a algorithm interview, which is much more meritocratic and hence most SWE situations disabuse themselves of prestige as much. However, as far as I saw from my time in Big Tech, I saw that Penn students are quite competitive with other schools , and also have strong placement. Also, remember that being a **big fish in a small pond** is *MUCH* better than a small fish in a big pond - you will suffer this in Berkeley EECS.\n\nOne other reason you should not index yourself that much on the academics - admittedly, your success on leadership and execution is less a barometer of your academic persuits but on your **extracurricular pursuits.** EECS is more rigorous. In other words, I would almost argue that you want the easier program.\n\nAnother thing - Regents is overrated, for the people I know who have this, you will find that most people find the crush of a large school still debilitating. It's helpful, but not a complete remedy. Remember, a class year for Cal is 8000. Penn is 2500 (with around 500 Wh and around 500 SEAS). You might think this makes Cal's alumni network  - from the majority of people I've talked to (CS and also Haas), it's very meh. Penn is polarizing - I've heard quite strong successes (mostly in IB, investing, consulting), moderate successes (PM), and some mehs (CS). However, the M&amp;T network is **underrated**. We have a dedicated alumni portal and system, some positions (startups, though this is *very helpful* for freshman internships) are specially sourced for M&amp;Ts, and in general, M&amp;T is known to be a pretty well known program among investors, investing, and business circles. SWE, not so much. However, I have found that M&amp;T does garner some more respect (albeit M&amp;Ts are a little bit excessive in flaunting their dual-degree status) to the general Penn alumni.\n\nA stronger point for Cal is entrepreneurship - it's  more conducive to entrepreneurship than Penn. The founders I know from Penn vs Cal (all of whom have received top investors in their seed and Series A), have felt that Penn's culture is more stifling given most people go the traditional safer routes of FAANG/SWE, Quant, MgmtConsult, IBD, and PE. However, Penn is working hard on this, and they recognize a potential inflection point in a few years. However, I might have circumstantial thoughts on this, as Contrary capital (a student VC firm) states Penn and Cal as pretty similar - [https://contrarycap-com.cdn.prismic.io/contrarycap-com/501ff789-0f1f-4fb4-85f2-96f897942d17\\_2020-university-report.pdf](https://contrarycap-com.cdn.prismic.io/contrarycap-com/501ff789-0f1f-4fb4-85f2-96f897942d17_2020-university-report.pdf)\n\nA potential downside of Penn is its culture - it's quite fratty, and fairly cliquey. I can't speak to Cal as much, but if you are not a party person, I would consider this a strong negative. I can't give you a great input on Cal on this, as most of my friends when talking about this are in Haas, or CS students in Haas, and felt that it's a business clique and had somewhat similar experiences. But, if you love parties, Penn is known as the social ivy for a reason. Cal EECS - ehhh, the feeling I got was, nerdy. Penn CS is similar, but Penn is known for interdisciplinary aspects, so it's more muted.\n\nA final thought to close this out:\n\nConsider **deeply** what you want from a school. Think of the the **goals** you want **that you garner from the** ***experience of the school, NOT its output***\\*.\\* (you can't control what your exit is from your school, you can only determine your environment)\n\nHere's how I figured, Penn M&amp;T (very biased, but that's why you need to formulate goals and use this as your determining factor - also I only included decision factors that were indeed correct):\n\n\\- Penn Alumni network better in the industries that count - SWE is more meh.\n\n\\- Penn CIS is not bad (#16 on research), but Wharton is #1 (everyone in Haas will say this is true with no concession), and while EECS is #1-3 CS doesn't care as much. Further, Penn CIS allows you to submatriculate and if timed properly, you can complete your undergrad in M&amp;T and grad in CIS in 4 years - around 4 students do this every year. 4 years, 3 degrees - what a bargain! Finally, support for CIS is better when you have a class of 200 versus a class of 1900 for the equivalent intro-level CS class.\n\n\\- Entrepreneurship is something I thought was interesting, but I felt was something I didn't want to pursue in college as I felt that I wanted to get a stable career first.\n\n\\- M&amp;T is a much bigger differentiator for me, and the intersection of Business and Technology is something in which many people I respect when talking to them always note as \"smart idea\". Degree doesn't matter, but having it in your career narrative is helpful. It aligned with my overall career trajectory.\n\n\\- Getting into Haas/MET afterwards is a pain, so why the hassle. Wharton alumni network also keeps your doors open - and a fair number of people feel like you don't need an MBA after getting a Wharton undergrad (in fact, many WhMBAs I speak to feel the undergrad is more rigorous and demands more respect).\n\n\\- Wharton you can choose your concentration pretty late. SEAS you can change from CIS to SystemsEng as well. Cal it's very tough, and often, you can't change without some bs requirements.\n\nFinally, **there is no wrong decision**. You'll find that most successful people will tell you - \"I don't know how I got here\", and more importantly, there is no one right way. What matters more is how you use your environment to differentiate yourself and form your narrative, this unique narrative will achieve the success you desire (money, leadership, etc.)\n\nGood luck!",

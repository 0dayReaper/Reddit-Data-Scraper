    "postText": "I\u2019m renting an apartment for 3 mo. over the summer, and it doesn\u2019t come with furniture. It\u2019s 5ish hours away and I will have a minivan to bring all my stuff, so the way I see it I\u2019m mostly just lacking a bed\u2014 other furniture can either be brought or I can live without. Does anyone have any recommendations on how to get a cheap bed? I can\u2019t take one with me and I can\u2019t bring it back. I know there are some furniture rental places, but those are usually complete sets and more expensive than I want, but maybe I could order some sort of cheap bed to meet me there? Has anyone else had this problem?",

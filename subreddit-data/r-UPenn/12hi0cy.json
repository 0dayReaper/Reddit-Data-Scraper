    "postText": "I'm looking for info/feedback on the health insurance and housing options available to graduate students at Penn. Right now it's a real possibility I'm coming here in the fall so I'm looking into all the variables now. I know there's on-campus housing for grad students but the feedback online seems equivocal or contradictory. I haven't seem much about the health insurance. Any info appreciated regarding either (or ideally both) of these topics from current or past grads at Penn. Thanks!",

            "comment": "If the grad student housing is still just Sansom Place, I\u2019d recommend looking elsewhere. Lived there for a year and the building is old and janky, maintenance took forever to fill requests, and you pay outrageous rent for the quality of living space. Some people are fine with the building but personally I\u2019d put my money elsewhere after my experience there. It really was just brutal how much money I was paying for what I was getting. Also I think they are planning to tear it down in the near future, in case that indicates its quality. \n\nThe Penn health insurance strikes me as expensive, but if you are fine with the price tag I\u2019ve found it pretty good. Student health services will provide a lot of services for free with the student health insurance including doctors visits, vaccinations, and sexual health care. If you need coverage for dental, I believe it\u2019s an extra cost but I could be wrong, but if you need coverage for physical therapy and/or mental health, you\u2019ll probably want a different provider as I don\u2019t believe Penn offers those services. \n\nCaveat: this is just going off my memory and personal experience",

Probably depends on past experiences with housing, lol.\n\nMental health not being covered or even offered is interesting and even surprising. At least it doesn't sound like there are copays directly for visits otherwise. Do you remember if there are specialists working at Penn directly, like through the hospital?",

The perk of PSIP is it\u2019s coverage of things Penn offers through its Student Health Services. But if you have PSIP and are going to services off campus, like a psychologist, physical therapist, or other type of a appointment, I\u2019m not sure how well PSIP holds up there versus an independent plan. For example, Penn Student Health Services has fully covered any vaccines I\u2019ve requested with my PSIP. Getting vaccines off campus at an independent clinic cost me out of pocket even with PSIP. \n\nAs you noted, the comment below goes into much better detail, and checking out the PSIP itself is a great idea too. Best of luck!",

Unfortunately, the majority of them flat out do no accept private insurance plans; you have to pay cash/check/credit/debit in full.  There are enough patients using their services that are willing to pay cash such that mental health providers see no reason to deal with insurance hassles nor accept lower reimbursed rates.  They collect cash, they get to keep everything.\n\nIt's a major problem that we dealt with on [SHIAC](http://www.penn-nec.org/universitywide-committee-descriptions) (for which I was a grad student repesentative for six years).",

            "comment": "Are you an international student?  If not, I would **not** do on-campus graduate housing, to the extent it even exists.  [Sansom Place](https://residential-services.business-services.upenn.edu/sansom-place-west) is closing this May, and there is only one privately-managed option affiliated with Penn coming on board called The Accolade.  The only reason why I say international is graduate housing solves all of your problems, all the furniture will be there.  But there are hundreds, if not 1,000+, international students at Penn and plenty of them live in off-campus housing.\n\nBeyond that, why would you want to live in essentially undergrad dorm housing?  There are so many wonderful rowhomes and neighborhoods in University City or even Center City that are an easy walk/bike/bus/trolley ride away from campus.  You'll feel like an adult having an actual off-campus apartment.\n\nRegarding health insurance, there is only one option offered by Penn - the [Penn Student Insurance Plan](https://wellness.upenn.edu/immunization-insurance-compliance/insurance-compliance) (PSIP).  It is very robust with a very low deductible and out of pocket maximum.  [Here is the page](https://wellness.upenn.edu/about-penn-student-insurance-plan-psip) with details about cost, and here is a [more detailed PDF from Aetna](https://www.aetnastudenthealth.com/schools/upenn/pdbs2223.pdf), the underwriter for the plan.\n\n**You must** have health insurance to be a student at Penn.  If you choose to waive PSIP, you must have coverage under a different plan (potentially your parents' plan under the ACA 26 years rule), but it must satisfy certain requirements.  For example, if your parents have a minimal plan, it likely will not satisfy the coverage requirements and you'll have to enroll in PSIP or get an ACA exchange plan, but PSIP is definitely better value for the premium cost.\n\nLastly, depending on what graduate program you are in, you may be offered PSIP health insurance as part of your fellowship. This is usually reserved for PhD students, and I'm not sure if it's covered by all PhD programs.  I was in a biomedical research program, so our PSIP premium was covered since this program generates tons of research dollars that are used to fund R&amp;D operations.",

My main goal with housing is it being very close to the campus - within ideally 10 minutes walking distance - but also safe, well maintained, and ideally not outrageously expensive. Probably a studio too since that's best for my ability to study, even if it costs more. I'm going to read through the PSIP pages later --- thanks for sending them.",

I still haven't accepted it because I don't know a lot about it. Can anyone that went through it in engineering before share their experiences? I'm planning to major in BAS in biomedical science (premed track).\n\nSome questions to guide your answers:\n\n* How is the social scene?\n* Are the pros worth taking three extra seminars?\n* In general, what are some of your experiences in it?",

Bfs restricts ur schedule more hence why I declined.\n\nSocial scene is prob good cuz u will get hill college house which imo is the best freshman dorm (and I live in quad lol).",

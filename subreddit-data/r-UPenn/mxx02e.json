    "postText": " Hi. \n\nThis is long overdue, but it's taken me a while to process and admit to myself what happened. First of all, fuck you. In no way do I want this to start a lot of shit, I frankly am doing this as a way of closure for myself. I know you\u2019ll know who you are and I hope you feel fucking guilty. I suspect you don\u2019t even know you raped me unfortunately, so hopefully this will fucking enlighten you and make you feel like shit for the rest of your pathetic life. \n\nI knew from the moment I woke up at 5AM to find myself in your bed, that what had happened was wrong. I tried to play it off like I meant for it to happen, but I knew I wouldn\u2019t have chosen to have sex with you while sober. After I immediately walked home at that absurd hour, I stayed in bed the entire next day, confused as to why it happened. How it happened. You raped me and I knew it even if I didn\u2019t want to admit it to myself at the time. \n\nI always thought that if I got raped I would report my rapist. I would never let someone get away with that. But it was different when it happened to me. I thought you were my friend. I had always considered you a good guy, which was why drunk me was okay when my friends left me alone with you at your frat\u2019s party that night. I thought I\u2019d be safe with you. I thought you\u2019d protect me from other guys and even walk me home. I never knew I\u2019d have to be scared of you.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the walk back to your dorm. I don\u2019t remember taking off my clothes. I dont remember what your fucking dick looks like. I don\u2019t even remember if you wore a condom or not. I only remember a single flashback where I asked, laying flat on my back, if you were done yet. To which you replied \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nI wish I didn\u2019t remember that. It was actually disgusting how you were using my body as a vessel to fuck while I was barely even conscious. How is that even attractive? Or were you just so desperate that you were happy I finally was drunk enough to get home? Tbh you hovered around me at every party I saw you at. It seems like you were trying to use me for a while and I was finally drunk enough that night. I was literally just a warm body for you that night. You\u2019re disgusting.\n\nEven though I knew it was rape for the longest time, I couldn\u2019t admit it to myself. I couldn\u2019t make myself a victim. But subconsciously I knew. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to wear the clothes I was wearing that night. I still can\u2019t.\n\nNearly a year and half later, I\u2019ve processed what\u2019s happened. I can assure you that this semester has been the worst part of my entire life. I sob almost daily to the point where I can\u2019t breath. I have to take prescribed anxiety medication whenever I feel overwhelmed by the incident. I can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve had to turn off my zoom camera in the middle of class to cry about what you did to me. \n\nAnd you know what? Even after hours of therapy and multiple antidepressants to cope with what YOU did to ME, I still blame myself. Part of me still thinks you're a good person which is why I haven\u2019t reported you/confronted you. But you can\u2019t be. The more I think about that night the more I am in complete shock of how you could've done that to me while I was in that state. I was clearly not sober. How did you not know? I was fucking starfished on the bed. Did I even have my eyes open? I was definitely WAY too drunk to consent and you should\u2019ve at least realized that if you didn\u2019t recognize I was blacked out. I did not ever want to have sex with you under ANY circumstances. You\u2019re fucking perverted by being so desperate to get your fucking dick wet that you had to rape a blacked out girl you were \u201cfriends\u201d with. I know deep down you\u2019re the guilty person, but even after all of this my heart still puts more blame on myself than you. I was supposed to protect myself. I never wanted to become a part of the statistics, but it feels like I put myself there. But no -- you're the guilty party. \n\nNow, every relationship I am and will ever be in, this is something that I will have to tell my partner. It will forever affect my ability to have sex and form relationships with men normally. You violated and disrespected me the most by raping me while I was blacked out, completely out of my own control and under yours. I don\u2019t understand how you thought that night was okay.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I want out of this letter. Maybe I want you to know the intense guilt and shame I feel from that night. Maybe I want you to know that your crime has made me feel disconnected from my sense of worth and self-identity. Maybe I don\u2019t want to be slut shamed anymore. Maybe I just want you to know that you aren\u2019t a \u201cnice guy\u201d whether you raped me intentionally or not. You still raped me and I want you to feel guilty for that. I won\u2019t ever accept an apology. I know you knew better. You\u2019re fucking pathetic. Please feel guilty for the rest of your entire life, you . \n\nYou\u2019ve made me feel like my body isn\u2019t even mine. You\u2019ve made me question whether I\u2019m more than just an object or not. You\u2019ve made me question how every guy looks at me when I pass them on the street. You\u2019ve made me ashamed to be a woman. I\u2019ve had to (and still have to) work through so much shit to get to a healthy place with myself.\n\nI know you know who you are. Do not contact me under any circumstances. I can\u2019t believe you casually texted me just 2 days ago. I already have you blocked on everything now anyways. I do not want an apology from you, you could never apologize enough for the pain you\u2019ve put me through.\n\nIf you ever see me again, don\u2019t fucking look at me, don\u2019t fucking talk to me, and stay out of all places you\u2019ll know I\u2019ll be at. Just leave me alone forever. \n\nHope your life sucks and no woman ever has to interact with you again. \n\n\\-Anonymous",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t know if this is for you or me\n\nI know no expression of empathy or sorrow can resolve the daily turmoil you feel inside. Those who haven't experienced rape can never begin to imagine the magnitude of pain a single person can inflict on another: it\u2019s a psychological civil war. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to believe it was rape either. I didn\u2019t need that trauma. I didn\u2019t ask for that trauma. \n\nI only agreed to go to a date night\n\nThe saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies. I believed my pre-med predator was one of the sweetest people in the world \u2013\u2013 it didn\u2019t stop him from trying to have sex with me while intoxicated and physically injured.\n\nThe most fucked up part? I blamed myself for it. I knew I wouldn\u2019t have had sex with him sober. I wore boxers to the event. I didn\u2019t shave. I could barely remember it. I was injured. Yet, just like you, I couldn\u2019t help but think it was my fault it happened. \n\nIt felt like someone reached inside my chest and took a piece out. I struggled with this nagging sense of worthlessness. The fact a \u2018smart\u2019 guy thought having sex with me in that condition was O.K. made me feel subhuman. This is the conflict. This is the war. I knew I was worth it and the people around me loved me, but that didn\u2019t stop the voice inside from asking if all I was was an object. Cue depression. \n\nThat part of you that thinks he\u2019s a good person, I understand. I never said anything to my rapist either. Even our mutual friends still think he\u2019s a good person. Inside though, I know he\u2019s a piece of fucking dogshit just like your rapist. I don\u2019t expect you to agree, but guys don\u2019t get a free pass because they're drunk. I wondered how someone could do something so horrific to another human being and not even recognize it or be apologetic. Meanwhile, I woke up sad on a sunny day.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you will really hear this, but please try to. You are not that event. The incident doesn\u2019t have social meaning or value, and it cannot define you. You have to decide whether you accept this. \n\nI don\u2019t know what therapists recommend, but I became spiritual after CAPs patronized me. The ideas, opinions, events, etc. we give power to in our minds will manifest themselves in different ways. Be wary of what you allow yourself to believe about your personhood, because I promise you it will shape the person you are. I dissociated from the event and stopped giving it meaning. I don\u2019t speak of it, the few ppl who know aren\u2019t allowed to mention it, and I removed the person from all my social medias. I don\u2019t know what your circumstances are to allow you to do this, but practice being conscious of your negative thoughts, critically observe them, and then let them go. You won\u2019t be cured of the trauma, but you can work to make the burden bearable. \n\nI still get triggered when men make me feel devalued in a similar way, but this has become rare because of how much I\u2019ve worked to detached meaning from that cursed night. You shouldn\u2019t have to put in extra work to fix your mental health. This is something fucked up that life put in your way and it\u2019s unfair. Don\u2019t let it weigh down your spirit though. You are strong, and you can get through this. I believe in you.\n\nBest, \n\nProtect your energy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s. he isn\u2019t in sig chi",

I can relate to a lot of if bc I was raped by someone who I loved and who loved me (or I thought) and I was complexly destroyed by it. The flashbacks, the crying, the not eating, the feeling dead inside, all of it. I want to say that today I am much better and that healing is possible but I just takes time. I can\u2019t even vocalize it so I totally get how you might not be able to report it; it\u2019s just too traumatic to speak about. That is totally ok because we all have our limits on what we can handle, even if it means that the perpetrator gets away, or gets away for now. If you haven\u2019t found a support group, I highly recommend it. Even online can be helpful in the healing process. Wishing you all the best.",

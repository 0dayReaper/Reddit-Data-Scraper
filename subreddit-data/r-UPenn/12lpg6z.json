    "postText": "Hello y'all,\n\nMy first Reddit post, here we go!\n\nI'll be starting at the MUSA program this fall intake and was wondering if someone could help me out with the following questions:\n\n1. How heavy is the workload in the first semester? I will start my first semester with 4 standard MUSA courses (Public policy, Data science, Statistics, and modelling geographic space) and consider taking two more electives (one free elective, one within a certificate program). Is that feasible?\n2. What are some of the best electives? I know that this depends on what I want to specialize, but are there any elective classes that have outstanding teachers or content?\n3. Are there any research / TA opportunities? \n4. What do you wish you had known before starting your studies?\n5. What is the biggest takeaway you have from the program?\n\nThanks in advance",

Depending on your coding experience the workload can be a lot as Public Policy goes right into heavy R. Spatial Statistics complements Public Policy well as you go through the same modeling concepts in each class, learning that statistical concepts in stats and applying them in R in public policy. \n\nDo you mean geospatial data science? it is similar to Public Policy but in python instead of R. I didn't take it, as I did the JavaScript path instead. I also didn't take modelling geographic space, but it should be good.  \n\n2. Yeah there are many elective paths to take, depending on the main urban planning concepts you want to focus on. I took economic development courses but also transportation, housing and community development  and others are options. Really if you can convince the program admin 2 courses make sense for an urban content focus then you can take them. \n\n3. Yes definitely, if you seek it out. \n\n4. I dont know lol\n\n5. Biggest take away is an appreciation for open-source technologies and the positive impact they can have. Also I've made many wonderful brilliant friends. \n\nOverall its been a great program! I won't sugarcoat the workload, it can be intense at times, but the material is so fascinating it is worth it. \n\n\\- u/chuembucket",

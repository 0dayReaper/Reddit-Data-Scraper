I wouldn\u2019t really mind a roommate but definitely prefer a single. I heard Lauder has suites with single rooms? Any other residences for freshmen like this? Thanks.",

As far as a single in the quad, kings court, and hill, it would be best to answer the questions on your application that would indicate that you really don\u2019t want a roommate.",

If you put Lauder as your first choice and choose options such as you want your room to be really quiet, you can\u2019t sleep with any noise etc, getting a single isn\u2019t too hard. \n\nMy friends and I(we\u2019re all freshman) did this and got into Lauder last year when it was arguably harder to get into due to it being a 4 year house.",

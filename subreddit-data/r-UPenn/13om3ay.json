    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm an incoming freshman in CAS weighing if Hill/BFS is the right housing and program environment for me and wanted to see if any of you have experiences or thoughts. \n\n\\- I am planning on doing an uncoordinated dual-degree or double major, most likely in political science or some humanities/social science field as my primary major and I'm undecided otherwise. I love the ISP courses and that is a significant component of why I applied to the program, but the amount of credits, although they overlap with Gen Eds, does concern me a bit as I'll have \\~less room for exploration. \n\n\\- I would prefer a single due to lifestyle/personal accommodations, but I'm open to a double and it's not a dealbreaker. \n\n\\- The research emphasis/allocated internship funding is a huge plus for me, for those of you who have done BFS, is the funding adequate and does being in the program help at all with support for finding, securing, or conducting research?\n\n\\- Personalized advising is also great, as my schedule is currently complicated and having someone to iron that out with is helpful.\n\n\\- I really value the opportunity to immediately gain a community and socialize, connect with profs/peers, and stay involved extracurricular wise. Are these aspects that tend to be present within the program? \n\nOverall, I enjoy the idea of being in a structured program and community like BFS and I genuinely enjoy all of the aspects of BFS including the course topics, interdisciplinary focus, and the tight-knit housing experience. The only aspects holding me back are that I am really drawn to other housing options like KCECH and Du Bois and pursuing a somewhat rigorous and inadvertently credit filled schedule. Although I'm very interested in BFS, I don't want to be drawn in and ultimately realize I didn't consider my options and what would be the best overall experience for me. Do any of you have thoughts on the possibility of getting a single in Hill, how BFS/ISP was for you in terms of rigor/credits (particularly if you're a double major), or any advice?\n\nThank you so much for any insight!!",

Im also doing double major and I declined bfs cuz it would put me behind.\n\nYou can very easily find research opportunities without being in a specialized program.\n\nBut hill college house is awesome, the best option imo",

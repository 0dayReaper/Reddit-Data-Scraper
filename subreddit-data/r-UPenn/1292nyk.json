    "postText": "* Should I write in paragraphs or in pointers\n* My non profit just reached the 5000 children milestone and got featured in 2 national newspapers but they are in my local language. Should I mention this ?\n* I got accepted to two flagships schools in my country (with a less than 1% acceptance rate for CS). Should I mention this ? And go on further to write down why I am still interested in attending Penn.\n* My startup also got a good amount of funding and my co founder, who also happens to be my mentor, is willing to write an LOR. Will this be useful ? My company aims to take an industry worth USD 3,674.95 million online and has relatively less competition in my country.\n* I was also working on a project which has been till date considered almost impossible to implement by humanity. But I think I *might* have found a way for it. Should I talk about it ? It would be a very technical thing for the AO to understand, but I can try.\n* Should I provide notion links to all of my works ?\n* How many pages are sufficient ?\n\nAlso if anyone of you is willing to personally help me out, please comment and I'll pm you or you can PM me directly. Would mean a lot.\n\nThank you.",

An IIT CS degree is only comparable to Caltech/MIT in technical rigor. You\u2019re not missing out on anything tbh stop being neurotic. Write a concise 1 page letter if you want to quickly highlight anything new that you haven\u2019t mentioned on your initial app. Realistically in the non pandemic years UPenn\u2019s waitlist acceptance rate has hovered around 0.5% so don\u2019t waste too much time worrying about it.",

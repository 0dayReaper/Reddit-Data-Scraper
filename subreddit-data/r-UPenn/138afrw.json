    "postText": "Hi, your average grade grabber here. About to tank my gpa with a cis class this semester and I want to know if say, I got an A- in that cis class but got an A+ in another class, assuming all A's otherwise and assuming all credits equal, will the term GPA still be a 4.0? (would the A+ and A- complement?) I know if I got all A's any A+ wouldn't do anything to the GPA, but curious in this case. Thanks y'all!",

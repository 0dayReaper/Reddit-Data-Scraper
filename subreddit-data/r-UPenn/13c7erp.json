    "postText": "I am an incoming CAS freshman so I guess this is a question for sophomore year I think? But eitherway I am interested in doing Urban Studies at CAS and Real Estate at Wharton. How feasible is this?  How heavy would the academic burden be? Should I simply stay in CAS for Urban Studies and instead do a double major on Econ or PPE? Or Major in Urban Studies in CAS and get a Minor on Real Estate at Wharton?",

If you wanna do the dual degree it's a lot harder but pretty doable. Note that most of wharton curriculum is just fundamental business classes. That being said if you want to work in real estate, you can't really do it without taking accounting and the like so it might be worth it.",

Just keep your grades decent and try to join groups that represent this interest. The dual degree is meant for interesting combinations like this.",

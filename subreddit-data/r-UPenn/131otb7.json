If I could make a geofence for where things are *nice*, I\u2019d say:\n\n50th and woodland\n\n51st and chestnut\n\n32nd and Wallace \n\nAll the way down the river till about 47th and grays ferry",

(I was in math, which is at the eastern end of campus.)    I could walk it in 25 minutes; Google Maps says 14 minutes by trolley, but that's excluding waiting time.  So I pretty much always walked, because I don't like being crammed in with people and I was cheap.  But it was nice to be right on the trolley line for access to Center City when I wanted it.\n\nI can't comment on what prices are like these days...",

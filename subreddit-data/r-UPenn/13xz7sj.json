    "postText": "Hi folks!\n\nI'm an incoming PhD student at Penn GSE, and I've just set up my Office 365 account with my upenn.edu email address.\n\nI've been using Gmail all of my academic and professional life, and am pretty annoyed about the required switch to Outlook. Does anyone know of a way to make their Penn email flow out of their personal Gmail inbox? \n\nI was able to successfully set up my Gmail to \"Send as\" my Penn email, but when I try to set up my Gmail to receive messages at my Penn email, I get an error message.\n\nThe IT department told me that this wasn't supported, but I figured someone must have found a workaround. \n\nMany thanks!",

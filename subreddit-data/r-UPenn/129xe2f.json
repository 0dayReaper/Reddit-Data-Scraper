A lot of the core classes ban or severely limit collaboration and I didn't like how in 160/121, they would bluff about catching people collaborating to scare people.\n\nSome people will be willing to help you out, but not everyone. I assume it becomes more collaborative as you move forward in CS, which is why upperclassmen might have different opinions.\n\nThis is kinda an unpopular opinion, but I feel like if you take the \"Rajiv sequence\" the envrionment is a lot more competitive than the other cohort.",

(Besides the disgusting 8:30 am class \ud83d\ude2b)\n\n* Pre-med \n* Planning to concentrate in Medical Anthropology and Global Health \n\n1) should I take an English/writing instead of 2 anthropology classes? (I\u2019m really good at writing so not super worried, but love anthropology!!) \n\n2) I\u2019ve seen that other students were recommended Chem over Bio, not super sure as to why. If anyone could explain a little more I\u2019d appreciate it \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd!\n\nThx :)",

I would only take Biol 1121 if you're really confident in bio. Biol 1101 is an easier option (but you will have to take biol 1102 as well)\n\nMost people recommend starting off with chem (instead of bio) if you don't plan to take a gap year because there are much more chem requirements (gen chem 2, Orgo 1 &amp; 2, biochem). It's just better to get those started earlier if you don't want a gap year.",

I took AP chem junior year, and while I feel confident in a gen chem class, I really don\u2019t want the bio stuff to fade. I definitely see what everyone\u2019s saying about the chem requirements now ! Thx for sharing and I\u2019ll be sure to ask my pre-major advisor too!!",

            "comment": "My freshman schedule was VERY similar to yours. I did just fine, and keep in mind that your anth classes will be easier than both biol 1121 and math 1300, and from experience, ANTH 1238 is a fantastic class (especially with Petryna - I absolutely loved it), and anth classes tend to be more writing heavcy, since you said you're good at writing.\n\nAs someone with strong bio experience (took HL IB Bio), biol 1121 wasnt too hard at all. i think people just arent used to college level classes straight into freshman year, but if you're well adjusted they aren't too difficult. As some other commenters said, past midterms wil be your best friend when studying for it, my first exam i didnt use them and then learned from my mistake. It's nice if you're premed, as you can get your intro bio out of the way in one semester instead of two, and if you've done a lot with molecular bio (as i had in the past), it will be largely review (which is what is was for me).\n\nI'm NOT premed -- keep that in mind, but I am a bio major. As to what other people have said, most people take gen chem first sem instead of bio, which i didn't do, but i dont have the MCAT to study and prep for, which you will, in which case it's best to have all your chem done by fall sem junior year, or even spring sophomore year. As a premed, you have to take 5 total classes of chem (2 gen chem, 2 orgo, 1 biochem, but orgo 2 and biochem can be taken the same sem, though it is challengoing). Personally, I didnt take gen chem freshman fall and i would be fine on the chem aspect if i were to take the MCAT, but keep in mind that you'll also have to take physics as well.\n\nLast note, i would super recommend taking anth 1238. As i said before, its a great class, and when it comes down to it, writing sem is more focused on the writing rather than the actual content, so you'll learn a lot more about med anthro taking anth 1238 than if you were to take it as a writing sem.",

I think I\u2019m leaning towards gen chem since that seems like the best option for a premed having to worry about MCAT, like you brought up. Will still try to iron it out with advisor but I managed to switch chem into the schedule and keep everything else pretty stable (mainly had to jumble the recitations- which I\u2019m still wondering how mandatory some of those are?) \n\nI was already excited for medical anthropology BEFORE, but now I\u2019m so freaking hyped. Thx for reassuring me in that decision!! Decided I\u2019ll be taking the writing seminar on global health for spring semester if all works out in my favor. Still connected to the general medical anthropology theme, but going into it with the experience from 2 ANTH classes (hopefully that background makes the writing seminar even smoother sailing). \n\nAgain thx for taking the time to write this out. I\u2019m a first gen student, so I\u2019m already unfamiliar with college as is, but a freakin Ivy makes everything feel 10x scarier. Keep up the awesome work of helping the little guys \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd \n\n*same to everyone else who responded with such nice advise \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

For the most part, those were the large topics covered, though there were some other things covered which I can't quite remember.",

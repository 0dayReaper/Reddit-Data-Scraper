    "postText": "It seems like most freshmen cs majors are taking CIS 1600 with Rajiv in the fall rather than in the spring with an easier professor. Is it really worth taking this class in the fall instead of the spring, especially since freshman fall is students' first semester at Penn and it's suggested to get accustomed to it first? Why or why not?",

It seems like most take it with rajiv because we tend to be on Reddit more lol, but it\u2019s like half and half in reality.\n\nIt is significantly easier in the spring to the point it\u2019s not even the same class. U will prob get a lower grade taking it with rajiv but u will learn more. That being said 160 and 121 with rajiv will prob be the most brutal classes u take at Penn especially cuz it\u2019s ur first year. If ur coming in with no prior experience and actually following the collaboration rules it\u2019s even more brutal. There were moments in 160 where I wanted to transfer cuz it was taking up all my time and I still was doing horribly. \n\nId say if u don\u2019t really care that much about cs theory and u just want the degree to get a job take it in the spring. If ur more of a math person wanting to go to grad school possibly it might be worth it to take it with rajiv because one bad grade won\u2019t kill ur gpa \u2014 most people get around B+. Also don\u2019t take it with rajiv if u don\u2019t have a strong math background, a lot of the people in the class will have prior experience.\n\nA lot of people on here r gonna say the class was fine but there\u2019s a huge sampling bias on Reddit.\n\nFeel free to pm.",

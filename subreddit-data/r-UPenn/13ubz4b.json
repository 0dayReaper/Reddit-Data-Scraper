    "postText": "Hi guys. Im a rising junior in Wharton studying finance and statistics (with my fair share of coding courses), and I\u2019m interested in entering the quant space, mostly with a focus on trading. In terms of my career trajectory, I\u2019m kind of taking the typical route, and doing IB next year, and I know it\u2019s misguided, but I was hoping for security, and feel that there\u2019s so little people here at these places I imagine doing something other than swe, that\nI\u2019m not sure what \u201cpath\u201d to take, even though I recognize mine is probably not the right one. My grades haven\u2019t been the best either because of some more personal struggles, but I\u2019d love some guidance on this, and help figuring out how to move forward on this front. Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "This is my situation too - studying stat/fnce, taken coding classes, want to do quant but I'm in IB next summer.\n\nAfaik a lot of quant shops don't like applicants from business schools or those that appear interested in wall street jobs so they often penalize business/econ majors because of what they're studying for trading roles. In reality for trading you really only need strong mental math skills and a great understanding of probability (which anyone can develop) but they prefer people explicitly majoring in math, CS, etc. I've also heard the GPA cutoff is usually 3.5 for trading.",

I'm thinking I just invest my time in research and improve a bit on the academic to break in in the long run. hopefully this is a way, if not 'the' way",

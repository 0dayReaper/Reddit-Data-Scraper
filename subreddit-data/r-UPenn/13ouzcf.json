And most importantly, how do you deal with the loneliness of working alone everyday?  \n\n\nI am new to this, and am having a super hard time with my work rate. :(",

            "comment": "It probably has to do with temperamental differences in personalities and the kind of dispositions one has towards socializing with others. For me, in relation to studying at least, I\u2019ve always worked alone, as far back as I can remember. I have a relatively vibrant social circle and have collaborated on different classes but I find myself too distracted if I am even remotely social while studying. Apart from productivity, I find it more convenient to work on my own schedule and at my own privacy. In combination, I find that it\u2019s crucial to have designated times/plans to spend quality time with others in order to not feel alientated and drained.",

At least at the moment, I am unable to commit to the plans I make. I think I will try to find some place for this. Sticking to some kind of a schedule seems very important.",

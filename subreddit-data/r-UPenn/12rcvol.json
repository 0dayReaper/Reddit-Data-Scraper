I will be renting the pods space for the duration of my internship and was wondering if anyone else is staying here as well.\n\nI am from nyc, and so I am not familiar with Philly or the building. Has anyone actually stayed at the Mason? How was the experience?",

Haven't stayed long enough to comment on hygiene. Bathroom for pods seemed ok. Maybe spend a day or two to come here and look around options.",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm currently living at The Mason in one of their pod rooms but moving out for the summer.\n\nIt's convenient for the price but don't expect luxury or anything. During my stay there have been a lot of utility outages so bring a fan for summer if you move here and be prepared for wifi issues and some days without hot water &gt;:(. The pods are listed as $750 a month but with utilities and fees it comes to \\~$905 a month. I'm tryna see if I can get money back/discounted since the utilities have been so iffy but idk. \n\nThe common spaces are clean and people are responsible for cleaning their own rooms and bathrooms. Its an apartment in a city so it's not gonna be sparkly clean but in my experience it's fine. The guest policy is kinda annoying because info is inconsistent - on the outpost website it says no guests but on my lease they said up to 4 days a month which still sucks if you want to have a friend or a partner say for a little while. \n\nThe pod rooms are great timing wise because they let you sign really short leases so if you want to stay in the mason for only one semester/over the summer it's convenient. Honestly I would only recommend staying here if you want a pod room because for the prices of the bigger spaces I'm sure you could find a much nicer apartment in the area. \n\nIn the pod they give you a bed with a mattress, a small desk, an uncomfy desk chair, and a decently sized dresser with mirror doors. The bathroom has one drawer for you and one for the other person you share it with. The communal kitchen has an induction stove top and a dishwasher and a microwave. The washer-dryer situation is in the basement and you have to use a app to pay $1.50 per load and per dryer cycle. mail is pretty simple - there's an app you register with and you go to the basement to scan a code and a locker will open (just make sure the address name and apartment number match what you registered on the app). \n\nThe people at the front desk are really a coin flip in helpful and responsible vs rude and negligent (I saw them getting yelled at by their boss for not watching cameras/being rude to residents so maybe that will change.) The people who helped me move in were super sweet and helpful and I only ever go to the front desk if I see them on shift. \n\nIf you have any questions about the mason I can try to answer but that's all I can think of rn. good luck with finding a place and with the internship!",

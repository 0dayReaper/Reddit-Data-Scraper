    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI got into upenn lrsm reu which means I'll be staying at upenn for about 10 weeks during the summer. This is the first time I've independently lived outside of my house (I don't travel much or do anything without my family) and I wanted to make the most out of my ten weeks at upenn. Any recommendations for activities or places worth checking out?? doesn't have to be on campus since I'll have a car. Also what do you guys usually do on campus if you have a free day? what areas do you like spending your time at and where do you find good food? thanks!",

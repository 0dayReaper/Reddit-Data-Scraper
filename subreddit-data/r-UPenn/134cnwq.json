I am currently pursuing a Biology major with a Bioethics minor, and the course load is manageable but decently high. In your case, I\u2019d recommend either drop a major or switch to Neuroscience as a major to get the pre-med reqs out of your way followed by a minor in either English or Mathematics. \n\nJust letting you know, Math department at Penn isn\u2019t great, so do what you will with that.",

I made the ridiculous decision to do 2 engineering majors and I\u2019m making it work. It really depends on you personally and how much time you\u2019re willing to dedicate to make this work. Some people can barely just fit premed, but lots of people do a lot on top of premed. If you\u2019re motivated, go for it, and you can always drop stuff if it\u2019s too much. Also if you\u2019re interested in being a math major, consider taking the honors math sequence ( it used to be MATH 160/260 but I don\u2019t know what they changed it to). The difference is that it\u2019s proof-based, which you probably would like if you like the major. It gets you out of the general calc classes that lots of people are forced to take and the profs don\u2019t really want to teach, which is why everyone says the math dept is bad (it\u2019s not, just the first few general classes are).",

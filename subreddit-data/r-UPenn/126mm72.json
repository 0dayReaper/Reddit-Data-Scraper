When I graduated I moved to 47th and Chester, and eventually 49Th and Baltimore, and can say confidently that in 4 years of living in that west Philly, it is one of the most beautiful, spacious, safe, friendly, and \u201cdiverse\u201d parts of the city. I put diverse in quotes because the diversity is a consequence of gentrification, so take that with a heavy grain of salt. Walking to work every day I could meet the local junk collector, a set of new white parents with a stroller, a set of new Indian parents with a stroller, a father and his disabled adult son, a black yuppie on their way to the financial district, tons of privileged wealthy students, an elder from a local group home, a generational house with little kids spraying each other with a hose, a professor I knew, and a landlord who owned a dozen homes in the area.\n\nI really *really* miss how homely that area of Philly is. I would actually recommend trying to live further from campus, just so that you can experience it. Especially if you can be near Clark Park.",

I like chestnut because of the bus line, but spruce, baltimore Ave, etc are a bit prettier and less... industrial imo. But in terms of safety, I've never felt unsafe and have walked home alone on several occasions, and by myself as well (not saying it's a good idea lol, but I have!).",

They have cool happenings there on weekends like farmers markets. Also, the 34 trolley is convenient to get to campus or downtown. The bad area of west philly is past market to girard called \u201cthe bottom.\u201d Its not really too terrible by my standards, but if you\u2019re not from a city or urban environment i dont recommend it. I honestly dont understand why penn students on average are scared of going past 40th. It\u2019s a safe area, lots of families, young professionals, hipsters. The only area I always recommend other Penn students not to go is North philly, like if you\u2019re on the El train, don\u2019t go past Berks or Girard, period. (Broad st line - don\u2019t go past Girard). West philly is perfectly fine, especially if you stay to the left of Market. \n\nI\u2019m from philly &amp; when i tell other penn students where i live they are always shocked. Lol (past 45th). I\u2019m a girl.",

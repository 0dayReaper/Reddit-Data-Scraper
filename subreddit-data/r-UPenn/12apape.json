    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m reaching out today a little concerned with the academic rigor at penn. I was accepted to a few other schools-vanderbilt, Columbia, Dartmouth, WashU, Emory. All for social science degrees. How do you think Penn compares to these? Do students find it difficult to balance work and social life? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Caveat: This probably changes somewhat over time and I've been out of school for a few years.\n\nThere is a wide spectrum of course difficulty. Sometimes you just get unlucky with teachers, but for the most part there tends to be a broad enough pool of available courses in social sciences that you have a choice between pursuing more quantitative, research-intensive classes or softer courses with more hand-holding and qualitative assignments. I suspect this is common to most of the other large schools you mention. Penn might have slightly more variation in course difficulty than some of the others, because my impression was that the central Penn admin tends to be especially hands-off with respect to workload and course difficulty, and they pretty much delegate all decisions related to that to your professor or the department.\n\nBasically, if you want to get easy As while still learning about the subject, you can almost always find a way to do that, but you might need to ask around a bit about specific instructors and courses. If you want to pursue an extremely rigorous path with grad-level material that requires significant quantitative background, that is also usually available. The specifics depend a lot on what program you are in, but I can confidently say the above applies to economics and linguistics at Penn.\n\nMy advice informed by my own mistakes has always been that pretty much everyone should mostly take the easy-A courses that still introduce you to interesting material while taking one or two of the more rigorous courses at a time. That way you can actually keep up with readings and absorb the material. I don't think anyone really learns most effectively when taking on more than that. This is not hard to achieve at Penn except that there is often a competitive culture among the students that will make you feel like you are supposed to take the most advanced courses and the busiest schedules to be a serious student. People who choose to drown in work don't usually end up winning out in the end, and it is much easier to develop good study habits when you don't start out by diving into the deep end. Penn might have a reputation for rigor based largely on that competitive culture and the harm it can cause, but it is ultimately your choice whether to participate.",

                            "comment": "Those should be very manageable at Penn. There are lots of easy but interesting courses to fill most of the requirements in those subjects. There are also lots of available research opportunities including many related to the local area. I would definitely encourage reaching out to profs about their research early and often because that is one of the main value adds of going to a big research institution like Penn. I personally learned as much from research as from courses and professors love it when you want to do research.\n\nThe biggest qualification regarding difficulty is that if you do psych or something adjacent, you will likely have to take at least a few pre-med classes. Those courses can be a shock because they sometimes have very unforgiving curves. They aren't necessarily very difficult in terms of cognitive challenge, but you need to treat studying for them like a regular job because they tend to be quite heavy on memorization.",

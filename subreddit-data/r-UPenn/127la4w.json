    "postText": "I'm a current freshman in college who is currently undecided but generally leaning towards more STEM disciplines, thinking of at least double majoring or possibly a dual degree with engineering, and I'd like to minor in English if possible. I also got recently accepted into the Penn Summer Abroad programs in London and Madrid. While I do think that Madrid might be a more interesting experience considering the fact that I have already been to London, and I\u2019m interested in languages and cultures, going to London would give me 1/3 of an English minor, which would make it much more feasible, and the minor is something that I really do want. Madrid would not give me credit for anything at all because I\u2019ve already fulfilled the language requirement (through AP Spanish).\n\nJust to add, I\u2019m excited by the London program too! (the above makes me sound like I\u2019m not) and I think both would be good experiences. I just think that Madrid has the potential to be a bit more of an interesting experience due to the greater differences (and the fact that I'd get to use the Spanish I've spent all these years learning, since I've wanted to continue with it if I got the chance), but of course I don\u2019t really know. I love English too (which is why I want to minor in it), and at the end of the day two credits is a lot.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with either program or advice?",

    "postText": "Incoming student here, I just took the AP Calc BC exam today and walked out pretty confident that I got a 5, but a couple hours later a friend and I was chatting and they told me that I shouldn\u2019t use an erasable pen for the frq cuz the ink might fade away from heat\n\nAnd guess what! I used an erasable pen haha\u2026thought I was smart about it. So if I don\u2019t get credit for MATH 1400, I\u2019d like to try placing out of it. How hard is it to place out of?",

Depending on where it gets shipped, it may hit that temp inside a hot car, but at this time of year it's unlikely for most of the US.\n\nAlso, using regular pen can save you time on super crunched exams - being forced to cross out is faster than trying to erase out of habit.",

Not sure about the passing rate, but generally somewhere around the 75-80% range is solid.

If you don\u2019t place out, I\u2019d still recommend taking 1410 and just trying your absolute hardest to get a B+ (the requirement for retro credit). If you don\u2019t get it you can always go back and take 1400 to fulfill the requirement. They aren\u2019t really the same content at all either so 1400 won\u2019t help you do better in 1410.",

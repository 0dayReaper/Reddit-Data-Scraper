    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming PhD student in 23 Fall. I have just started looking for apartments near the university city. I mainly searched through [apartments.com](https://apartments.com) and zillow but I found out many \"luxury\" apartments(left bank, 3737 chestnut, etc) are quite expensive considering my stipend (about 3k/month after tax). So I am wondering if there are options that are affordable(under 1200/month for a studio/1bed or 2400/month for a 2B2B) near the campus?  My non-negotiables are: safe street(there could be evening classes;  just want to ensure I could walk back home safely at around 9 pm), less than 30 min walk to the campus(I don't have a car), central AC. Also any recommendations for good leasing companies? I have heard of University City Housing and I am curious about the experiences working with them. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi, current grad student here. Grad students either live in West Philly particularly around Clark Park or across the South Street bridge (center city,Fitler square, grad hospital etc.). Many people pay 1000-1500 for a studio on the city side and anywhere from 800-1500 for roommates on the city side. So just wanted to say while it\u2019s alarming to spend almost 50% of your stipend on housing, that\u2019s just life right now with rising costs and is like that in every other major city. \n\nMight be worth checking those areas out. Also I\u2019d recommend looking at the route of the penn shuttle and the septa buses so you can live close to a stop if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.",

            "comment": "If you want a less than 30 minute walk, you are probably going to be constrained to just west Philly. I live just across the river in grad hospital and my walk to campus is just over 30 minutes. 1200 / month for a studio or 1 br is doable in west, but it might take a little searching to find a nice one at that price. Also, just a head\u2019s up. In big cities like Philly, rentals don\u2019t usually go on the market until a month or two before move in. So it might feel like places with an august move in are hard to find right now, but that will get easier as we go into the summer.",

I liked Philly so much more than my friends who lived in university city. I had better access to areas with people my age\u2026 the trail\u2026 Rittenhouse square park. Just my two cents!",

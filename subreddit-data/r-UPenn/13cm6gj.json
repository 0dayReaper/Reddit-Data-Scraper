I'm hoping to get a suite-style dorm with 2 other friends I met at Quaker days, but Penn only allows you to request one roommate, which doesn't work for our group of 3. Any recommendations on how we could try to get this anyway. Like for example, we all put the exact same, very uncommon, answers on the housing application. Although this is a bit risky, obviously. \n\nAny advice is great! Thanks.",

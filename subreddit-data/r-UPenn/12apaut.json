    "postText": "Hey! I currently have on-campus housing for next year but am considering moving off-campus. I don't really have a lot of knowledge about this process, if it's too late to join, etc. I am very very flexible about living situations - I'm a rising senior female, but am willing to live pretty much anywhere affordable (below 1300 or so a month) around campus, in an apartment complex, in West Philly, with any gender, undergrad or grad, etc. If you're interested, let's chat to see if we are compatible :)\n\nAdditionally, if anyone is looking for/open to two female roommates, please lmk! I have a friend who may be interested as long as it is affordable. If not, that's okay too.",

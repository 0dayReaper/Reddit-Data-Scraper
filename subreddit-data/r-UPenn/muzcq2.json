    "postText": "So I was saving up my saliva before going in to do the covid test like usual, and I guess I managed to save up an unusual amount. Basically I filled the tube a little too close to the top, so there was too much. They made me drink the extra off the top, and they chanted \"Spit drinker, spit drinker!\" at me. In all my life I've never felt so humiliated.",

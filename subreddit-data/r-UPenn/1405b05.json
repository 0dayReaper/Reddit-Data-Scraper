    "postText": "I am a student at UPenn and was wondering what would be better an accelerated masters in CIS or with GRASP doing Robotics. I am interested in robotics, AI, and coding. Would be on the software side of robotics. I may or may not work in robotics but I don't see myself just doing pure SAAS, want to have some electrical/mechanical skills. End goal for me is entrepreneurship.",

Besides you have 2 gen elective spots if there is a cis class you really wanna take that doesn\u2019t count for anything else",

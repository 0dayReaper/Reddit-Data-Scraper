    "postText": "If you\u2019re in a hurry or don\u2019t want to read everything I say, read the stuff about the sources of mental health problems (which is early on in the post) and then the solutions (which is near the end of the post).\n\nFirst off, some caveats:\n\n* Mental health is a tricky topic\n* I am no mental health professional or psychologist\n* This post is most likely not going to be helpful to everyone, since each person\u2019s situation is different\n* My perspective could be ignorant and feel free to give me constructive criticism in the comments\n\nHowever, some people could benefit from my observations. While mental health is not something that is easy to talk about, I think doing so is necessary to make progress. Since midterms are coming up, which is a major stress factor, I think now would be a good time to address this serious topic.\n\nObviously, heavy homework loads, tests, essays, and grades often lead to stress. But why stop the investigation there? I think the sources of mental health on campus are more subtle than that.\n\n**What I think are the biggest sources of mental health problems on campus:**\n\n1. Culture shock\n2. Numbers\n3. Image\n\nLet me paint you a story that might be relatable:\n\n&gt;So let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re in high school. You have a 4.0 unweighted GPA, you are the head of a club, and all your teachers are talking about how wonderful of a student you are. You consistently get awards for your academic achievements for the whole school to see. Then, it is senior year and to your joy, you get accepted into UPenn! Your family is crazy happy for you. Your teachers are talking about how you\u2019re going off to one of the best universities in America. You\u2019ve seen pictures of Locust Walk that are visually stunning, recognizing this is the heart of the campus you\u2019ll be at. You think you\u2019re off to what will be the best part of your life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fast forward to the end of your first semester at UPenn. But you feel disappointed because it is nowhere near as good as you expected. You feel that you didn\u2019t do well in your courses, even your major, and you think the professors\u2019 explanations are not coherent. You feel that you\u2019re \u201ctoo dumb\u201d to understand anything in the courses. You have a C on your transcript.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All you see on Facebook is people with 1000+ friends flaunting expensive designer clothing and their academic achievements. You think you have a horrible social life and horrible intelligence compared to those people. You think you don\u2019t belong at UPenn.\n\nLet\u2019s break parts of the story down to see what may be going on that isn't obvious on the surface.\n\nSo the happiness before the first semester at UPenn turns into sorrow after the first semester in the story. Perhaps there are things that changed that caused such a flip in emotion?\n\nThis brings me to the first reason I listed: the culture shock. There are multiple factors that I think go unaccounted in the transition in high school to UPenn that may require a change of attitude. For example, Cs on the transcript like I mentioned in the story. I\u2019m sure to most of us, a C in high school would have felt like a stain on your GPA, especially when considering ultra competitive universities like the Ivies. But that negative connotation of a C can subconsciously carry over to university, so some students don\u2019t react well to seeing a C. My view is that the attitude towards a C needs to be changed. Some definitions say C is an \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cbelow-average\u201d grade. But it is an \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cbelow-average\u201d grade among a pool of elite individuals. When you extend the scope outside of UPenn to the broader population, it is probably higher than the broader average. So a C shouldn\u2019t feel like an attack on your intelligence. But if you got a C and do want to improve, you should reflect on what went wrong in the course and what you can do in the future to be more prepared.\n\nAnother big change is that the people teaching you (the professors) don\u2019t have teaching as their primary duty, unlike teachers in high school. Professors are generally more interested in having their name attached to high profile research rather than their lecture notes. Yes, sometimes you\u2019ll have disinterested teachers in high school, but knowing that more of the professors are not interested in teaching, especially the lower level courses, is something one might need to have a shift in attitude for. Take your strongest subject and imagine having to teach it at a middle school level. That\u2019s basically what those professors feel about the lower level courses. So instead of thinking you\u2019re \u201ctoo dumb\u201d to understand anything in the lectures, think of the course syllabus as a roadmap of topics. In lectures, absorb the information, but don\u2019t fret over trying to understand everything the first time or if a majority of the lecture didn\u2019t make sense. Then, do your own research outside of class until you find something that fills in the gaps and you become ready to tackle the material with justifiable confidence.\n\nAbout numbers: whether it is people who have more friends on Facebook than you, more likes on their social media posts than you, higher GPA, or some other higher number than you. You\u2019re getting sucked into the numbers game. Let me tell you to not think a higher number of whatever means higher self-worth. So someone on Facebook has 1000 friends. But do you really think that each of those 1000 \u201cfriends\u201d are actually their friends by the definition of a friend, or do you think most of them are more like acquaintances? And tell me, would you rather have 1000 acquaintances, or 2 friends that will be your close friends for the rest of your life? So someone has a GPA of 4.0. That may be a measure of how high their grades are. But it does not measure how well they will actually use important skills in the future or how many meaningful experiences they have that speak far more than some numbers. See how focusing on just the numbers limits your view?\n\nMore on the subject of social media because it is an easy way for someone to build a persona on there: someone you see may look like they\u2019re having the ideal life (key word is \u201clook\u201d). But is that what\u2019s really happening? Think about it, do you think most people would rather post only their highs or only their lows? So by seeing someone\u2019s \u201cideal\u201d life, you\u2019re in reality only seeing a superficial image of them that ignores the hardships they\u2019re not drawing attention to. By the way, remember that students at UPenn, they were most likely top students in high school. Some probably want to relive the feeling of superiority over everyone around them, hence, why they brag. But others see that bragging and may try to one up the braggers. So then, it becomes an ugly bragging contest of people trying to look like the best.\n\nWhen you take a closer look though, why do people want to show their expensive possessions on social media anyway? Why do they brag? Because of their image. They don\u2019t need to be the best, as long as they can make you think they\u2019re the best. Image doesn\u2019t just stop at social media. When you think about it, a lot of the actions that relate to stress are subconsciously driven by image. Why are some people afraid of Cs and failures? Because they think it will tarnish their image with a blemish of ineptness or stupidity. Why are some people afraid to get help with mental health? Because they think it will make them look mentally weak (side note, there\u2019s never any wrong or attack on one's character to seek help with mental health).\n\nBeing perfect is unnatural. Mistakes are inevitable, and it is what makes us human. Using mistakes as your personal teacher to improve as a person, rather than creating a phony persona as being perfect, is what will let you progress further than those who pretend to be perfect.\n\n**Some solutions for the reader, having said all of this:**\n\n* **Know in advance who you want to reach out to when things go south:** Maybe a teacher from high school, a therapist, or a relative that has already graduated college (and one that you can trust obviously). Write them down on a Google Doc or wherever. Sometimes, mental health problems come up unexpectedly and out of the blue. So knowing who you want to reach out to when the time comes will save you the hassle of figuring out who to talk to.\n* **Similar to the point before, have \u201ccomfort\u201d entertainment when things go south:** Any nostalgic shows or videos that make you feel good when you rewatch them? Save it for moments when you\u2019re down. I have a YouTube playlist specifically for this reason. Also, if you\u2019re interested in anime, try shows from the iyashikei genre, which are specifically meant to have a serene and calming effect on the viewer.\n* **Remember why you\u2019re here at UPenn:** Did your friends, family, or teachers in high school praise you for any unique qualities you have? Use those to remind yourself that you're at UPenn for a reason. Think about why they praised you for those qualities.\n* **If you feel inferior to others because of what you see on social media, it might be best to get off such platforms for your own well-being:** Again, forget the numbers, forget how they portray themselves in a way that might not even be the big picture of their life.\n* **Try to ignore what others will think of you:** People are complicated, and it would be wrong for anyone to make judgements on your character by a small sample of all your actions. Maybe you\u2019re not convinced, so let\u2019s suppose someone does judge you by a small sample of your actions. Then, you can use their logic of a narrow view on character against them: \u201cThat person is inconsiderate. They\u2019re an unpleasant person. Might not want to be around them.\u201d\n* **Congratulate yourself for even the small steps:** I like the Weekly Win threads for this reason. Since every step of the way counts towards a bigger goal, there\u2019s no shame in patting yourself on the back for getting closer to that bigger goal. No need to wait until you reach that finish line to reward yourself.\n* **Have things to look forward to:** Is there a new video game or movie or event you\u2019re excited for? Use that as motivation to get through challenging days. It may not work for you, but specifically setting these days to look forward to when the game drops or whatever has made a noticeable difference in wanting to reach that day, which means moving forward.\n* EDIT: As u/UniverseBarce suggests in the comments, **try going to the gym.**\n\nIf I could snap my fingers and magically solve everyone\u2019s mental health problems, I would do so in an instant. But obviously, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been through the mental health wringer before. It was especially hard for a lot of people (including myself) to have their first few semesters at UPenn on Zoom with COVID running rampant. I thought the least I could do is write down my thoughts and observations from the lessons I learned the hard way so the UPenn community can benefit. Maybe these pieces of advice are obvious in hindsight, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re obvious to people hearing them for the first time.\n\nThis is a lot to take in, and my post is probably too rambly. But I wanted to articulate and demonstrate the issues at hand because they don't happen in a vacuum; they\u2019re interconnected.",

But as an extreme introvert and someone who doesn't enjoy sports/loathes the idea of being a gym rat and will never make that my personality, doesn't drink, doesn't party or bar hop, doesn't club, doesn't camp/hike/hunt/fish whatever the social life thing on most college campuses just isn't for me - personally. \n\nWhile I'm OPEN to making friends I'm also at a point where I wanna be left alone more because chances are, I'm not coming to anyone's party or riding the Erin Express or whatever the case may be. I'd rather be at home watching anime, playing with my animals, video games, or chilling out smoking a bowl. So if there are super low key people like that? I'd be all the way down to chill as long as they weren't asshats or misogynists - which is another issue I've seen on college campuses - a lot of both.  \n\n\nI think that while we are social creatures, it's important to fin a group you actually fit into because the whole fake it til you make it thing is just bullshit.

Everyone really does seem to feel like they need to keep up this facade that everything in their life is perfect, and at such a big school it can be hard for professors to see past that show even if they do sincerely care. Grad students do the same BS as undergrads, afraid to show any weakness, though to a lesser extent than undergrads it seems. Heck,  I've had a few people give me shocked looks when I've dared to admit I needed help with something or was struggling- but after the shock wore off, people generally do show they understand and try to help. Just... no one feels like they can admit they're struggling so everyone pretends they're totally fine, which further destroys mental health across the board. I was horrified when an undergrad I supervise told me this school really doesn't have any accessible mental healthcare options. Considering that UPenn has apparently ranked the #1 most depressed university in the US for several years in a row, this is an astronomical failure on the part of administration. Something's gotta change. Until administration makes a move, we all need to remember to be kind to one another and that this isn't a zero sum game- we can all succeed if we just help each other.",

Look at the middle schools who don't deal with bullying properly and then act shocked when a victim commits suicide or  opens fire on the school out of stress, look at high schools that handle mental health the same way, and even apparently colleges where they may have mental health resources, but there aren't nearly enough, they feel pretty limited etc. The issue I think is that the administration despite their grandstanding? Probably just sees most of their students as dollar signs and prestige brought to the university. We're handled like a business commodity and that needs to change I think before they will start taking the mental health of their student body seriously",

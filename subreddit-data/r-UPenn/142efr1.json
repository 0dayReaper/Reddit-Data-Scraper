    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'm currently a Highschool Senior interested in transferring to Upenn. I'm attending umich LSA in the fall and I wanted to know what it's like transferring to Penn. For those of you who got in through the transfer, what was it like trying to make friends and trying to get leadership positions in clubs? Was it a lot harder to get research opportunities being a transfer? At Penn, I don't know what I'll be majoring in because I initially wanted to bioengineering+premed but realized the sheer difficulty of the two and noticed how little transfer applicants got in so I opting for something easier. I'm not sure if I should do neurosci, bio or chem. Thank you!",

UMich is a great school there\u2019s like negligible difference. Also it might be harder to get a higher gpa at Penn which is all that matters for pre med. \n\nGo to UMich first and see if u like it. All my friends who go there really like it.",

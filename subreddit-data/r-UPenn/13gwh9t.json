    "postText": "Hello, I was considering taking Math 3120 after taking math 2400 this semester for the math minor. From the looks of it, it appears that this class is the proper next step (as opposed to math 3130?) Should I take it with Davi Maximo-Alexandrino-Nogueir or Peterka? I get the sense that this class is a bit easier than 2400, is this true?",

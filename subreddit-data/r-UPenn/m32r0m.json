    "postText": "***rant*** \n\nIt's a serious mood seeing half of Class of '23 go to Puerto Rico for vacation, posting pics/ig stories with a lot of people (I'm talking like 20+) with no masks, and thinking its okay. Obviously, no one is practicing social distancing guidelines, people are obviously still drinking though there arent bars and you cant drink openly and I doubt people are complying with the island wide curfew. To think that these people can't handle missing out on one spring break is absolutely disgusting to me, not only is Puerto Rico suffering as a result of COVID but the fact that they just tried to reopen schools and parents and children are terrified, most of their population is low income, and it is a literally category 4 hotspot made me shocked at how much students don't care. Literally some of these people will become public servants, or lawyers, or business owners, yet their putting the lives of those in Puerto Rico at risk, not to mention if one of them got Covid on the island (bc you dont need a test to come back to the mainland) and spread it to the Philadelphia community. I'm a pre-health student and I'm just so shocked at the crap I see during every break, knowing that my peers can be so self-centered to put the lives of others in danger. I understand that business on the island is important to the economy of PR, but seeing ig stories of crowds of college kids without masks makes me furious.",

Puerto Rico already has an extremely crippled infrastructure paired with a massively lacking medical system. We were fine at the start of the pandemic until you filthy fucking tourists started bringing the virus to the island near the summer. \n\nMost of y'all are unknowingly, but fucking selfishly bringing literal death to the homes of a disadvantaged people. There were americans who *knowingly* traveled to PR with the fucking virus. We have already been fucked by the US for over a century, we aren't your fucking pandemic vacation spot, stay the fuck home.\n\nSidenote: OP, thank you for having the awareness to know of PR's hardship. Very few truly understand more than just \"they got hit by a hard hurricane\", it's been one of the hardest things to deal with here. I appreciate people like you.",

I wish the government of PR would have just barred travel into the island. I understand that tourism is a big source of income, but the lives of PR's citizens are far too valuable to designate as unimportant or expendable. It's bull\\*\\*\\*\\*. The hurricane hit you guys *extremely* hard, and that has a long lasting impact on the island. I'm praying for la bella isla del encanto.",

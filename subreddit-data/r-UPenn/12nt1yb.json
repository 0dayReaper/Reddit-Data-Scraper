One girl in my class reads her answers out loud so she makes sure everyone knows she\u2019s \u201cahead\u201d, many other students don\u2019t send notes or resources if you missed a class, and they always talk about how unfulfilling a career in tech/consulting/banking is. \n\nAnd what really concerns me is how dumb they are; I\u2019m often gawking at how poor their thought process is during a problem: they always act like they know exactly how to solve anything and they jump right into it to prove that they\u2019re the \u201csmartest.\u201d Telltale signs of a dumbass. How did you even get in to this school?\n\nThe fact that these inbreds are going to become doctors is concerning: it feels like they have no sympathy at all and are giving themselves copium by thinking they\u2019ll be \u201csaving people\u201d in return for being heavily in debt and making 2-4x less than their peers in banking/tech/other pre-professional careers. Anyone else share this experience?",

If I had to take a guess, we were each dropped on our heads when we were little which stunted our brain function aside from memorization. Some of us are probably just more insecure about our handicap, which explains the overcompensation by the girl you mentioned.",

They\u2019re consistently told that PSOM is one of the best med schools in the country and the admission rate is so low - that does not exactly breed humility! The system disproportionately selects for people born on third base that sincerely believe that they only became MDs through hard work alone - the class divide is real.",

It's that there's nothing else to them *besides* being premed. Constant validation seeking (in the form of invalidating others).\n\nI say all of this as someone who is premed themselves, but quite frankly, I haven't had an experience like this, or met a person at Penn who would actually say that they're the \"smartest\" or \"saving lives.\"\n\nPremeds tend to be more condescending in more subtle ways. For example, people might always ask \"where are you doing research\" or \"what lab are you working in this summer?\" People that have to physically tell you they're smart aren't smart.\n\nI don't know if its because my social circles contain almost no premeds (because I don't even think they go out at all or do anything besides homework) but like I said, I genuinely have not met a premed at Penn like OP described, as someone who is premed. People love to complain about how it's impossible to be premed and social. It's not. I think they just want validation for being a loser? I'm pretty social (not tabard level) and go out on the weekends and I'm still able to get my work done and have a good GPA. They want solace in thinking that they're better for not going out. This is true.\n\nSomeone with this attitude won't make it to med school, and even then, only 50% of doctors match into residency anyways. It's rough.\n\nSorry you had this experience - a premed\n\nedit: saw another comment about prelaw. I will say, the ex-premed to prelaw people are the WORST! i don't think they have a  genuine passion for one or the other, it's like when premed doesn't work out, what is the next pre-professional grad route I can take? law. it's embarrassing. I would never admit to someone that I was premed and then after one semester switched the prelaw because math 1400 beat my ass\ud83d\udc80",

A specialist in the medic field makes around (generously) 500K in comparison. Plus while the med student is racking up debt for 4 yrs and getting a low salary for another 4 during residency, the banker is making (conservatively) 350K per year. Right when the doctor is finally licensed, the wealth gap between the doctor and the banker is already more than 3M. The doctor will never catch up to the pace of the banker\u2019s salary.

There was a pre-med who I once thought would be a good person to partner up with, but he eventually ghosted me and didn't respond to my messages soon after our initial conversation. He had a lot of the competitive pre-professional culture - someone who had written literature reviews, tons of publications, and even a website showing his work and accomplishments. He may seem nice at first, but as you talk with him you can sometimes get a feeling that he may be either condescending or dismissive of other types of people such as PhDs who he views as \"anonymous basic researchers.\" And one of his recent opinion pieces was lambasted by several physicians on both Reddit and the Student-Doctor Network. Not only did they say his argument is asinine but also said that he lacked humility and other qualities important for being a doctor and should even remove his website. \n\nThat being said, there are also several other pre-meds that you may find less detestable. A few of my friends who are pre-med are actually very nice and are willing to help me and others with getting towards their goal to med school/becoming a doctor, or at least discussing things both in and out of the pre-med life. I do agree that there is overzealous competitiveness in the pre-med culture who may be hard-committed towards medicine. However, there also exist many of us who are not entirely sure what we want to do with our lives and admire other fields such as technology and finance. I myself am a more well-rounded person who has been exposed to not just clinical experience but also bioinformatics and healthcare management, and understanding the work that other health professionals or clinically related fields do helps me appreciate how they support physicians. The pre-meds who have an air of arrogance in either their ability or the superiority of medicine over anything else often are those who will not succeed in becoming good doctors.",

            "comment": "- it feels like they have no sympathy at all and are giving themselves copium by thinking they\u2019ll be \u201csaving people\u201d in return for being heavily in debt and making 2-4x less than their peers in banking/tech/other pre-professional careers. Anyone else share this experience?\n\nWhy are you shitting on them for making 2-4x less than their peers and being in debt? Most of these people come from super rich families so they probably won't even have debt. Not everyone cares about money. Probably won't even pay for medical school themselves, they can get their parents to pay that shit and then make bank once they are out of residency\n\nAlso, on your point of sympathy, most people don't choose or like their careers because of goodwill/to help people. Jobs that have goodwill are often just a side bonus. As an M&amp;T student, I'm sure you know that\n\nNot to invalidate your experience with our premeds ofc, although I haven't met people as bad as you say lmao",

As many are saying here they seem to think they have the perfect major and many probably don\u2019t realize that even out of residency the salary of IB/tech/etc will be higher (VP/managers in 10 yrs) in comparison, which means that the people in premed should be doing it out of good will, which they don\u2019t seem to be. If they\u2019re only in it for the money and prestige go into banking instead of trying to make a false narrative of saving people to think they\u2019re better is what I\u2019m getting at. I respect healthcare workers to death but it\u2019s crazy to think that they would act like this in their undergrad years.",

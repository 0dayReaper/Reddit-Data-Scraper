    "postText": "Woke up ready for my biweekly Covid test speedrun today and was feeling it - the trick is to go at 7:00 AM when no one is there to interfere. Started my timer right after the guy at the front told me I could go in. I sprinted to the counter closest to me and smashed my PennCard on there before doing a lateral lunge to the #1 desk.\n\nUp until now I had been collecting spit and I had exactly 2mL in my mouth at this point. \"Hohn Thmith, May fif,\" I yelled before grabbing a handful of vials, alcohol wipes, and the entire printer to save time as I ran over to station #10. I uncapped the vial and hurled my salivary juices into it while I used my toes to rip open the alcohol wipe. I ran towards the nurse and started reeling my arm back, before pitching my vial, label, and the entire printer from earlier to her at 60mph once I got to the 6 ft. mark. I  made sure to take the entire hand sanitizer bottle as I ran towards the exit, as public health&gt;&gt;speedrunning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13.46 seconds!!! Up 2.31 seconds from my last run - I think the gleeking exercises really helped. Waiting for official verification rn but it looks promising!!!",

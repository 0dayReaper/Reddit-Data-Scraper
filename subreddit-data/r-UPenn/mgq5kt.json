    "postText": "shoutout to the guy who made me uncomfortable as FUCK by 1920 like 30 minutes ago while I was just trying to take a walk. did quarantine make y\u2019all forget common decency? he was creeping on me while going for a run and would slow down to walk next to me then run ahead and then stop to \u201cstretch\u201d and \u201ctie his shoe\u201d so I would pass him and he could stare at my ass then ran up to me and told me I look \u201creaaaally good\u201d while making eyes at my hips. and then he just kept running and ran away! how long is it going to take for it to get into your heads that it\u2019s just NOT appropriate to walk up to a stranger and comment on their body? it\u2019s predatory and unwanted. I\u2019m already having a shit day and like the last thing I need is a guy following me and hitting on me while I\u2019m minding my fucking business. ITS NOT ROMANTIC TO FOLLOW A WOMAN. \n\nLike this shit happens on the street REGULARLY like the amount of times I\u2019ve been cat called at night just waking from acme to my dorm and it doesn\u2019t matter what I\u2019m wearing I\u2019ll have my hair hidden, mask on, knee length jacket, wide leg pants, face down. I\u2019ve even been FLASHED by some old dude while walking a block past acme. Also I\u2019m realizing half of our male classmates don\u2019t even realize this shit is happening.\n\nit\u2019s just a whole different level when it\u2019s clearly a penn student and it\u2019s on campus. I thought I could expect a little bit more, u know? do better men.",

I'm so sick of this crap, and I don't understand the logic behind getting a kick out of making someone else uncomfortable. I don't care how desperate a guy is. It is NEVER *remotely* acceptable to do this. It certainly doesn't make them more \"macho\" or attractive (DEFINITELY not). I'm sorry this happened to you. A woman should never have to feel uncomfortable while walking on the street at any time of the day (I understand that going out at night *is* especially dangerous, but it shouldn't have to be), and the men doing this should be taught a lesson. A harsh one.",

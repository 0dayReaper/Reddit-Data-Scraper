Both of my parents are deceased and it\u2019s pointless for me to put \u201c0\u201d in all of the slots because there is no checkbox for deceased. Idk like I understand it\u2019s a unique situation but like it seems a little insensitive not to have it as an option at least? Then they wouldn\u2019t have to read the additional information section either every year.",

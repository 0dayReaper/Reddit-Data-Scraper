    "postText": "Would taking Chem 1011 instead of Chem 1012 hurt me as a premed? Would it be easier to get a good grade in this class since probably students with more chem experience take 1012? Will med schools care that I took the easier class? Any advice you can offer would be very much appreciated :)",

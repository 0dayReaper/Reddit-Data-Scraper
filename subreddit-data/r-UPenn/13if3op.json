The homeworks are half written (mainly math) and half coding (python).\n\nI would recommend reviewing you linear algebra before starting the course. Vectors, matrices, rotation matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Also basics of calculus. It had more math than I expected. You can pm me if you have more questions.\n\nWhat other courses are you planning to take at the same time?",

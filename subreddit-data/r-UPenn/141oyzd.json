The other options are to pay for the garage which is roughly 2-300 per month the last time I checked. The parallel parking is not really viable because you\u2019ll need to use meters and they have time limits. The signs that say 2/3 hour parking mean that you have to pay for a maximum of 2/3 hours and then you have to leave the spot. There are non-metered spots at and above 40th street but those always have time limits during the day.\n\nsepta is garbage but the traffic is horrible, there\u2019s always something going on like construction, streets being blocked, etc, and philly drivers will swipe your car with no remorse lol. When i am coming to campus from the suburbs, i usually take regional rail to penn medicine station. Or if a specific line doesn\u2019t stop at PM station you can get off at 30th and take a trolley /walk to campus.",

There's 12 hour metered parking on Walnut (8 to 8; after/before is free). If you're willing to hike a bit, the residential area north of Lancaster and Spring Garden is unsigned and permit-free.",

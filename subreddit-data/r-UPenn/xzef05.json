    "postText": "I have lived on-campus at 2 different Ivy League colleges but have experience with many more colleges' campus experiences. Penn's staff culture problem is without question the worst I have ever experienced and is the worst that anyone I have spoken to has heard of, especially for a school of this level. Aside from professors and other academic staff, **every single person I have had the displeasure of interacting with at this university has either been rude or straight up maliciously incompetent.** If you have noticed the same and thought to yourself that this is normal for colleges, no, it isn't. And it shouldn't be accepted the way that it is.\n\nMy experiences with people in SRFS, housing, dining, and more have all been horrible. There is a huge \"not my problem\" attitude where people will just say whatever they have to say to get you out of their sight. I have tried to contact offices where they just had their phones disconnected at the phone terminal all together. I have sent many emails of importance that have all been ignored. Dining staff have made extremely rude (and borderline racist) comments to me **for just asking for another scoop of food.** This shit is seriously not normal. I don't know how anyone here is living with this and thinks it's ok. And if you don't think it's ok then why isn't anyone doing anything about it?\n\nOh right it's because this university will take action against you if you try to speak up about anything. If they'll revoke the degree of a rhodes scholar they'll do much worse to you, a random college student.\n\nThis school needs a complete overhaul of its administrative staff. Everyone needs to be fired. I'm not exaggerating - **everyone needs to be fired and replaced with people who care even 10% more for the students here paying tens of thousands of dollars per year.** Do not think that this is ok. It is not. And we deserve better.\n\nRemember me when I'm kicked out for posting this.",

Last weekend we had class, on Saturday we ran out of toilet paper and paper towels in both, men and women's restroom. It was horrible. 150 women and 3 men attending classes for 9 hours a day without toilet paper. This weekend, on Friday, I approached the program director and asked if she could please ask the janitor to leave extras of tp and pt and I didn't mind replacing when we needed. Her response was.. \"oh, so now I am responsible for toilet paper? Ok!.\" I said, if you mind, please let me know and I will bring it from home. \nYesterday, we ran out of paper towels. I know this seems like a small annoyance, but we pay much more money than the program is worth, the least we should have is toilet paper and paper towel, in a clean bathroom.",

And Penn continuously shows it does not care about the Philadelphia community. So, honestly, if I was a worker who was barely making it by because I got paid shit and had to deal with obviously privileged young adults 24/7 I would probably be losing my shit all the time, too. I feel like if you're rich and complaining about this it's kind of ignorant and insensitive. This is capitalism and being nice is not a requirement. Not to mention, Penn has a huge issue with diversity, where in its overall employment, it's quite obvious that white people are at the top and the black community is forced into these shitty underpaid jobs just to get by. I would want to murder someone if I were them.",

It really depends on where you are. Most Penn students don't even know about NE Philly, and couldn't even try to tell it apart from North, South, and West. Different norms in different neighborhoods. Sure, trashy people can be very rude, but have you been to any other large cities? You're not in the 'burbs anymore, Dorothy. \n\nAlso, how you treat the city and its people matters. I've seen a lot of out-of-towners trash this city and leave their mess expecting us to clean it up. Pieces of hot garbage, all of them. We're a tough crowd overall, but we're not generally rude to you if you show us some respect (which we don't just owe you because you come from elsewhere). You're in our city. Don't expect us to baby you. But if you ask for help, we'll give it to you, because we're people, not monsters.\n\nEDIT: I don't care what staff wages are. It doesn't entitle them to be rude. I've met people paid less in this city (in various areas) who are a joy to speak to, and really deserve to be earning more. Yes, we need better, kinder staff. Should wages be raised? Sure! I'm all for it. But no one forced the current staff members to work those jobs at their current wage, so a change in attitude is certainly warranted. Or a change in staff.",

Yes, obviously, there are business aspects to campus management, but at the end of the day, we're running a school where the service is education. \n\nKeep in mind, also, that many of the people who staff the units you mentioned specifically are not trained educators and have not dedicated time and effort to understanding the myriad issues around educational protocol, policy, student experience, etc.",

It genuinely impacts my day because if I want food I know i'll have to deal with people being mean- which sounds silly but it piles up. i haven't been back to houston since i was very aggressively accused of stealing (when I did not) and there was nothing i could do about it. Penn doesn't give us a way to report inappropriate behaviour of staff and I didnt want to risk arguing back. I dont even know where to start with tackling this issue. Encampment no. 2 perhaps?",

West Philadelphia has been a historically redlined area where the residents have been basically trapped in poverty for generations. Shut out of nearly every opportunity to gain generational wealth, gain a good education, or even leave the area. Yes, they are pissed off and taking their aggression out on you. Once you see it you can\u2019t unsee it, but you will understand the situation better and have a little compassion, even if it\u2019s unpleasant. Believe me, you have no idea how unpleasant most of the staff\u2019s lives are. I\u2019m sorry that this is happening. At the same time, much of Philadelphia has become a war zone. Venture out past 42nd street and you\u2019ll see. I recommend taking the Market Frankford line all the way out to 69th street and back. You will SEE things.",

As a Philadelphian, I've seen people make less and act far more pleasant than that (they really should be making more, because they're actually nice to interact with). And take the El past 42nd OR towards Frankford after Girard, and you'll see a lot. Poverty, and the people working to make ends meet. Most of them don't end up taking it out on you, though. There's no excuse.",

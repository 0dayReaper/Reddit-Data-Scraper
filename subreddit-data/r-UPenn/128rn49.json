    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all!\nI\u2019m a first gen student about to graduate with my BS in Biology from a local state school. \nI\u2019m from a pretty rural area and have been stumbling my way through university and academia. I started doing research, TAing, fellowships, and conferences because I thought it was fun and love to learn and help teach others. I\u2019ve fallen in love with UPenn and the focus on interdisciplinary learning for real world problems (I heard about the the IoT4Ag project at the MEAM open house and haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it). \nI know it can be difficult to get in but I\u2019m determined to try.\nI have no idea how to apply or write a CV/resume or if I should reach out to potential advisors or really how the grad school process works so ANY advice/help/ resources would be deeply appreciated.",

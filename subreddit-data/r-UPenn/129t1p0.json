Any experience or advice you guys have is very helpful! Is premed very stressful at Penn and is the community collaborative or very competitive?",

One thing to consider is browns admission to their medical school from their undergraduates: https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/health-careers/medical-admission-data-snapshot\n\nAll are amazing schools and give ample opportunity for premeds, just another thing to consider!",

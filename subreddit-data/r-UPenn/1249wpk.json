He\u2019s willing to sit with you for a LONG time if you have issues and meet with him in office hours but the class itself is brutal. To be fair most class in Neuro are brutal though it\u2019s kind of a pick your poison I guess. Check if any courses by Professor Kaplan count toward major requirements I don\u2019t remember off the top of my head. He teaches a couple music based Neuro classes which are super interesting and fun. Do yourself a favor and avoid Cato or McLean, YMMV but I had a terrible time.",

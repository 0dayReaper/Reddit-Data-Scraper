    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming graduate student.\n\nI'm really satisfied with riding electric scooter in my hometown so I am planning to get one in Phily as well. But it seems the law is prohibiting the scooters while people dgaf and are riding ones in Univerisity City. I'm a bit confused. Can you explain what exactly is it like to ride scooter in the area? Will cops fine me if I'm unfortunate?\n\nAdditionally, where do you lock your scooters? There seems to be no building-inside bike racks at Penn. Is it safe to lock the scooter with U-lock at outside bike racks?\n\nThanks in advance : )",

I think there many obvious reasons why that\u2019s a good thing. But I agree, walking is probably better for their physical health. I just don\u2019t see why the risk of hitting people should be a reason to not ride scooters. Almost like people shouldn\u2019t drive cars in certain parts of the city because the risk of hitting people, which would be kind of nice because I like to walk and ride PEVs, and like you said, accidents happen. \n\nI\u2019m not around Philly as much as I used to be, but I was in the city just a couple days ago when someone hit a biker, then a parked car and flipped their own car.",

I'm from Philly, and I see it way too often, in every corner of the county. \n\nRiding scooters and other similar vehicles in Philly is more than normal. But I understand why most of campus is a no-go for that. My point is, if the signs are there, just follow them. If they're not there to keep people safe, they're definitely there to avoid liability. I'd love to roller skate down Locust, but I get why it's not permitted, and I have to respect that!",

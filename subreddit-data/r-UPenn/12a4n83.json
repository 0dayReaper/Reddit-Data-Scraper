    "postText": "Hey all, \n\nI was recently admitted to UPenn, but I also have a full ride scholarship to University of Maryland. I was also admitted to their honors college. Going to Penn would cost me about 45k, but if I was theoretically able to get some more aid, what do I do? \n\nFor context, I'm planning on majoring in bio/on a pre-med track. How would the environments and opportunities compare? Both are great for research, but one thing that sticks out about Penn is how close it is to the med school and various medical facilities. UMD is closer to DC while the med school is in Baltimore (like 1 hour away when accounting for traffic). However, both have similar med school acceptance rates. I'm just so conflicted and don't know what to do. Would love any and all advice/tips!",

Only reason you should pick an expensive school for pre-med is if your family is loaded enough to pay both college and medical school.",

With the full ride narrative and assuming you keep up a similar performance in undergrad, you should have no problem getting into med school. Penn has an edge in terms of perceived prestige and networking (and to some extent if you want to do research as an undergrad), but in terms of educational preparation for med school it's a wash.",

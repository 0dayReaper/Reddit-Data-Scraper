    "postText": "just another rant to add to this mess: I'm just so upset at how pre-health students are responding to this pandemic. the supposed care and empathy for other individuals that many pre-health students show in this place is so incredibly superficial. here are some examples:\n\n\\- pre-health students going to Puerto Rico (yall know who you are). what the absolute hell is wrong with you?!\n\n\\- pre-health frats deciding to rent two air bnbs for 50+ people and saying that physical and social distancing will occur. like in what universe will this really happen?? thankfully this was canceled but even the thought of doing this while no one is vaccinated is so appalling.\n\n\\- rich kids taking vaccine doses from people in classes 1a and 1b - you come to Penn from your home and decide to not only put these individuals at risk, but then also take what is meant for them? what???\n\n\\- some of you guys post so much shit on your stories about protecting the community, about healthcare disparities, about the lack of resources and healthcare thousands of individuals face and then head to a party or large gathering right after. seriously??\n\n\\- the obvious partying and lack of physical distancing. going into other people's dorm rooms and holding gatherings is NOT ALLOWED. it's not that hard to just meet outside, is it? this is just so exhausting to have to keep talking about, but it has to keep being said for these individuals to feel even an iota of shame for their actions.\n\nI hope that yall who are doing the above know that you don't deserve to become physicians. Physicians hold some of the highest honors and responsibilities in this world, and you think you are worth becoming one when you 1) can't even stop your urge to disregard covid guidelines for a time period of a few months and 2) don't give a single shit about the unbelievably fragile and vulnerable community you are surrounded by? absolutely not.",

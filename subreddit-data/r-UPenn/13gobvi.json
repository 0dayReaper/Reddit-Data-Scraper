    "postText": "I have Lauder as first but really have no idea how to rank between Quad, Gregory, KCECH, and Hill\n\nMain things I care ab rn:\n- want a single/suite-style single\n- Social Life: I want a social life but I\u2019d much rather be in a close-knit community than party and get drunk \n\nAnd one more thing that I think only pertains to Gregory. I\u2019ll prob take most classes in engineering, and Gregory is pretty far from the buildings there. It seems like around a 15 minute walk. Im not rlly sure how important this lack of proximity is, or how inconvenient it is. Can any Gregory students share their experience with this?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m also an incoming freshman, but from what I have heard, quad is the most social. you have a better chance of getting a single, but its more of a party environment i think. \n\nHill is also pretty social, but the chances of getting a single there is very slim. The common areas in hill are really great to make friends i think bc the dorms are so small that nobody wants to stay in them longer than they have to. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about kcech\u2019s social scene, but everyone i talked to about it said the people were always very chill there and it was less of a party scene. i doubt youd get a single in kcech bc only 2/73 of the rooms are singles and they are probably reserved for RAs. \n\nYou might wanna put Gregory further down on your list because its relatively far from campus and really isolated. I heard there will be an all freshman section of gregory in the next year so maybe the social scene will change, but im not entirely sure by how much.",

However, no singles. \n\nDo you have a particular reason for wanting a single? Having a roommate freshmen year can be a great experience, can provide you with a support system, and help you branch out. If you still want a single your only real option is quad, although there's often no real community there imo outside of getting sloshed.\n\nEdit: I forgot, but hill is a pretty good middle ground, there's sorta community between floor sections and it has singles. So it seems perfect for you.",

I just think that having a roommate is part of the freshman experience and an integral one at that. I don't know if I'd be concerned about your roommate taking over the space. I'd also not plan to go home every weekend, a lot of stuff happens on campus on the weekends so you might wanna stay for some of them. More importantly, you wanna be a little independent, branch out and really learn how to be an adult. But I digress. All I'm saying is consider the possibility of getting a roommate, even a random one and it might change your life.",

There are plenty of social opportunities at Gregory - your RA/GA will organize hall activities or drop in hours at least once a week, and there are also larger house-wide activities (movie screenings, language table, group cooking sessions, etc). I was also big on privacy, so I liked the suite setup. I still talk to some of my suitemates today.\n\nAs for the walk to the engineering part of campus, it\u2019s only an extra 5-10 minutes walk. You will have to leave a little earlier but Penn\u2019s campus is pretty compact anyway. I had some classes at DRL and never had an issue with time or commute.",

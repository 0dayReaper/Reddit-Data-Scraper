            "comment": "Imo CHIN 021 is more tedious (and moves faster obviously) than the regular track BUT if you already have a background in Chinese, you\u2019ll be fine as long as you study. My writing was ass before I started so dw if you don\u2019t have too much experience with writing. And since you have a Chinese background, you\u2019ll def do fine with some studying. \n\nWhat I noticed from talking to other people is that students with Chinese heritage who take the regular track find that their courses move too slowly. So if you want to take a super super chill class, then go with the regular track.",

    "postText": "So I was accepted to the CAS as part of the class of 2027 and I will be attending this August! However, I was accepted as a Math major. I applied back in December, and in the past few months I've realized I would prefer to study statistics instead of a more general math degree. However, statistics is in Wharton and not the CAS, so I would have to switch. I understand that statistics is just a concentration in Wharton and I'd be doing other business classes and I am ok with that, since I wanted to take business classes anyway. I know that I can try to transfer after my freshman year but I'd prefer to transfer to start as a stats major in Wharton? Is this possible? Thank you!",

The Stat minor on the other hand is like 7 classes, so even that is better. I am not sure if you understand what statistics is and what exactly you want to study, but to put it simple - best major for studying statistics is either math(honorary mention math econ) or CIS at Penn. That is if you view stats as a stem subject. If you view stats as bs ooga ooga draw a linear regression plot a histogram type of stuff(so useful stuff, but very low-level), then Wharton is the best place to study that",

A good chunk of them will count towards your math major (I think like 3 of them?). You can complete a minir but it isnt necessary I think? (I took almost 10 courses from the STAT dept and still dont have a minor). Math courses are also very important for deeper stat stuff too. \n\n STAT department at Penn is a weird thing. It is in Wharton but is generally much closwr to either math or cis dept than anything within Wharton.",

I was also dual degree in CAS (Physical sciences) and quite honestly I would say stick to CAS or SEAS if you want to get an intellectual STEM experience and minor in Stats or Data Science, which will still give enough experience in the subject..\n\nIf you really want to do a more Stats oriented curriculum and switch out of CAS, I'd recommend checking out the ESE programs in SEAS which have a large focus in Data Science and Stochastic Systems Analysis. Another thing I'm pretty sure you know is getting a math degree basically means you would be equipped to understand stats (especially the non-programming/R aspects) faster and more deeply than even stats majors. That's the power of a math major if done right.",

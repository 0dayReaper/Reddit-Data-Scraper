            "comment": "Everything that I write here is 100% anecdotal and the advice I give is be geared to what my situation was. It is possible that the current summer CIS 160 professor has changed the structure of the course, which is likely if the summer professor also teaches CIS 160 during the year. Before acting on my advice I would verify who the professor is and see if you can get your hands on the syllabus for summer 160 to compare to that of fall/spring 160.\n\nHistorcially, CIS 160 is more lax than the normal CIS 160. I did it\u2014got a good grade and was able to take all my classes in the correct semesters, but I always felt that I was at a disadvantage in the subject matter in many subsequent classes, including 121, 262, and STAT 430, which subsequently hampered my knowledge base in other more advanced classes where those initial classes were foundational. My understanding of graph theory and statistics to this day is weak because it was skipped altogether in my iteration of CIS 160, and I am planning on revisiting those topics in my spare time once I have a better grip on my work life balance.\n\nIf you\u2019re planning on doing the minor, or you don\u2019t really care that much about CS and just plan to collect checks after graduation, or you don\u2019t care about having rock-solid fundamentals, then summer 160 is good enough. If you like CS as an academic discipline and want to be highly competent at it, bite the bullet and take it during the year. You\u2019ll probably have at least one bumpy semester where you compress several difficult classes into the same schedule but it\u2019s worth it to get the higher quality learning and build a stronger foundation.\n\nEdited to reduce drama and egotism in response",

That's what, a few hours a week? You could self study all of 160 graph theory in like 2 weeks if you do it for an hour every night after your 9 - 5 job. I'm not exaggerating \n\nNot to invalidate your experience of course! I just don't think it's that critical",

It\u2019s not at all an exaggeration to say that lacking those fundamentals will increase the difficulty of everything you learn afterwards, including in industry. That\u2019s not to say you\u2019ll be an abject failure, you just won\u2019t have as much of a depth of knowledge ready to tap into. For that reason I advocate taking CIS 160 during the year, since it generally has a better quality of education.\n\nThat said you\u2019re probably right that it\u2019s a bit of a dramatic line of reasoning. I\u2019ll edit my original response.",

I wouldn't know whether the stuff from 160 shows up in industry but I still maintain it's not hard to just learn it then",

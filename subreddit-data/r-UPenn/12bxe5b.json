How is the leasing office attitude/responsiveness, maintenance request turnaround, pest/mice, safety, laundry, etc!\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Campus apartment is ok for the price. I think the maintenance is decent but some buildings can be old. So in my experience, some rooms can get cold in the winter and the utility bills can rack up from running the AC. Also have had bug issues one time which took a long time for maintenance to resolve. \n\nBasically, I think it's cheap but be aware of potential maintenance issues",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm a freshman that's been seeking for summer opportunities and recently got some results back. Currently, my best options are a CDC fellowship or PURM research position.\n\nThe CDC fellowship is at the Atlanta office (hybrid) and the PURM research is totally virtual. Since I'm from Atlanta, both options seem like very good opportunities for me.\n\nFor the CDC fellowship, I will be part of a \\~3 month project while the PURM research project lasts for 10 weeks but can extend to when I'm back at school. CDC will pay me around $3,000 per month while PURM gives out a one-time $5,000 stipend.\n\nMy concern is that although CDC has better pay and provides more real-world experience, it does not extend long-term like PURM would. I'm not even yet sure if I want to go into industry after college or pursue a higher degree.\n\nWhich option would you guys go with? Thanks!",

You'd have the option to try PURM the following year and the CDC internship is 1) going to pay way better tbh and 2) will look much more impressive on your resume later on. It's harder to get your foot in the door anywhere government related than it is to get into research here.",

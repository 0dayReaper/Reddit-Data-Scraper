Description:

The subreddit for the University of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, PA.

Rules:

Be respectful to others. Hate speech will not be tolerated.: * Racism and/or other forms of hate speech (including **but not limited to** sexism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-semitism, and islamophobia) will not be tolerated and will result in a ban.
* Disrespectful speech/trolling will be reviewed on a case by case basis.
* Harassment of any type will be met with a ban

No Buy/Sell posts: * Examples of violations include selling exams, essay writing services, application help, leases/subleases etc.
* In general we don't want the sub to be a buy/sell place since we (as mods) have no way of verifying the authenticity of offers.
* Try craigslist or facebook marketplace instead.
* If you believe that your post is an exception, feel free to PM us and we will review on a case-by-case basis.

Do not ask questions about general application help.: * You are free to ask about UPenn specific questions (however, there's a chance that your question may have been asked already, please utilize the search history function). 
* Do not ask about "chance"-ing you (/r/ApplyingToCollege would be more beneficial).

No political posts/comments will be allowed unless it is immediately relevant to campus life: * Stuff about politicians visiting campus, information about penn student political groups, current opinions on campus events, etc is allowed. 
* Use your best judgement here. If you have questions about what may/may not be appropriate, reach out to the mods.

Mods have the final say: * Moderators can ban/mute users and delete posts/comments as appropriate if there is a violation of any of the above rules (or anything else the moderators think is not appropriate for the subreddit).
* Also if you post a poll without a "See results" option, your post will be removed.
* This rule serves as a `else` block for situations not covered by the above.

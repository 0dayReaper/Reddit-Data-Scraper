    "postText": "As of late, there has been a large influx of \"Should I go to Penn or xyz for abc?\" type of threads. Most of the threads aren't really helpful because the vast majority of students can only testify for Penn's end, and many other concerns (such as financial costs) are generally more individual, with the exception of, again, students who can give insight on what Penn's financial aid is like.\n\nPosts comparing different schools should go to /r/ApplyingToCollege and not r/Upenn. That being said, specific questions about people's experiences here at Penn are more than welcome. Vague or general questions may be removed, and please, google first, then use the search function on the subreddit, and then make a post if it fits the guidelines.",

Anyone have any opinions? Which is better?",

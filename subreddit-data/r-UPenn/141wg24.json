            "comment": "i'm in the same situation this summer! i'm not sure about reading terminal, but so far the cheapest and most convenient way I've found is by using a combination of patco + septa. take the patco line from collingswood to 15th/16th and locust, then walk up to 16th and walnut to catch either the 21 or 42 septa bus into campus.\n\nget yourself the freedom card for patco and the septa key card for the best price if you're commuting in everyday, and you can easily top them up as needed at stations or online. i tried to see if penn reimburses us for commuting or gives student discounts but it seems like that's only for fall and spring semesters. hope this helps!",

            "comment": "The biophysics major is a broad paint stroke into the 3 big sciences, biology, chemistry, and physics, depending on the route you go you could end up taking more Chem classes than anything and with minimal effort end up a Chem biophysics double major. It\u2019s perfect for pre meds or grad school but are unsure of which of the 3 sciences you want to really get into for grad school. Biophysics as a discipline in and of itself is sort of niche and tbh I don\u2019t know a single biophysics major that wants to do biophysics as a career, while physics with a biological concentration is still a physics major which means you\u2019ll have a stronger background in math and physics than chemistry. It\u2019s less suited for pre meds imo, as part of the biophysics major requires you to take cell bio and biochem two essential classes for any aspiring med student. I personally love the biophysics major for being demanding but also very broad I feel like I have a better math background than anyone in biochem but I also have a better Chem background than anyone in physics. So if your an Uber nerd I guess it\u2019s right up your alley.\nTldr: biophysics is going to gear you up for grad school/ medical school, physics major will narrow you down to grad school in physics or a job in industry off rip.",

But from what I\u2019m hearing it is an established course of study so that\u2019s good to know! Is biophysics largely premed? I\u2019ve also been considering premed route but idk how cut out I am for it. As of now I\u2019m physics with a concentration in biological sciences but I am considering minoring or double majoring with biophysics since there\u2019s a large course overlap. Again, thank you so much for the information!!!",

Yeah the best thing about biophysics is the ability to double major with minimal effort, im currently a Chem biophysics double major so that\u2019s really fun!",

Is there anyone in this sub who is in this program who can tell me a bit more about their experience within the program and how well they are faring? I'm heavily considering coming to UPenn but I am seeking more insight into how students enjoyed the program and what their review is.",

            "comment": "Hi! I was in the specialized studies program but had a fair amount of close friends doing the core program.\nI really enjoyed my time during because for me, starting a new leaf felt so freeing. And I was surrounded by people of such interesting and unique life stories, all with great ambitions and awesome personalities. So I grew a lot as a person, too.\nThe research opportunities here are very accessible and easy to get into. Penn's post-bacc is a very well resourced program if you're looking for extracurriculars to boost your app. Tons of opportunities get emailed your way every week. Not something any post bacc can provide.\nThe work it takes to do well in the core program really depends on how strong your study habits are and how much other stuff you're juggling at the same time. The classes I've heard are sometimes challenging, but fair. They don't hand out A's like candy or artificially pad grades, but if you work hard at it, you'll get what you deserve. \nPenn is well regarded and has a myriad of linkages to other schools too, which is definitely something to consider. The coursework prepared me very well for my MCAT too. \nIf you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help!",

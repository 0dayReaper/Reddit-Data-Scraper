    "postText": "I'm not sure if anyone will have perspective on this but I'm a current senior looking to commit to Penn. Part of my financial aid package was a work study for $3,500 but I'm looking to walk on to the track and field team when I get to campus. Would work study still be a possibility as a student-athlete or would I not have time? I would only be on the outdoor track and field team as I'm a javelin thrower so I wouldn't be competing in the fall or winter, just practicing.",

You don't have to do it to pay for your tuition or anything like that. So if you find that you won't have time you don't have to do it. \n\nEssentially, the impact for work study for you is it just makes it easier for you to find a student job (because the fed gov pays half to the person employing you).",

    "postText": "Hi, I have a question: this summer, I am planning on taking Organic Chemistry I with lab, working in a research lab, and volunteering at a free clinic. Do you think this is unrealistic? I'm asking because I have a chronic tendency to bite off more than I can chew, and really need to safeguard my GPA as well. Additionally, I am taking the course with Simon Tong, who is said to be a really good instructor. I would appreciate any insights!",

His main area of research is like ??? DNA and migrations??? My guy???\n\nHe has literally included blatantly false information in some lectures, unnecessary nudes in others (seriously!! WHY! defining things would have been enough, thanks!)...\n\nGenerally everywhere disrespectful language towards trans people and bizarre takes on the lgbt community\n\nHe's been banned from teaching this class once already in 2019???? Why is he still doing it\n\nProbably bc he has tenure\n\nPenn moment fr",

I will preface this by saying that it is preferable to refer to transgender people as \"transgender people\" rather than \"transgenders.\" I don't mean to be nitpicky, it just has a more friendly feeling to it.\n\nSchurr's presentation about gender stated that the majority of transgender people are heterosexual -- this is pretty easy to look up and double check. It is also factually incorrect (according to the 2015 US trans health survey, this number is actually around 15%). \n\nWithin the same presentation, he also used language that is generally frowned upon such as \"transgendered\" and \"transsexual,\" as well as putting up an old picture of Elliot Page along with his deadname (name prior to transitioning).\n\nThe same presentation also described the result of FTM bottom surgery as a \"fleshy protuberance that is shaped like a penis.\" Firstly, I'm not quite sure why he thinks a cis man's penis is anything more than a \"fleshy protuberance.\" Secondly, I'm not sure why *anyone* would describe *anyone's* genitals that way. Third, it's directly from a WebMD article saying that trans youth shouldn't be allowed to transition (\"Transgender Docs Warn About Gender-Affirmative Care for Youth - WebMD\").\n\nDuring the same class, he encouraged students to question why trans healthcare could be controversial, opening up some students' points that \"a fair number of people detransition,\" that \"taxes should not be spent on trans healthcare and should instead be going to a useful place like the military,\" and that \"the treatment of transgender people is driven by big pharma who just want the money.\" He did not in any way refute these opinions.\n\nBesides that, I just remember this one infographic of a bunch of cartoon men on the Kinsey scale Schurr uses where the gayer it gets, the less clothing and the more flamboyant they are. It's kind of funny, but I don't think it belongs in an educational context.",

We had a short lesson on transgender people and he seemed genuinely confused on the matter (idk why he taught it then) and kept switching pronoun usage when talking about trans people. I'd like to think that it doesn't come from a place of hate but out of ignorance, but idk. He gave us assignments where we were required to weigh ourselves and publicly compare our weights during recitation, but the TAs changed that assignment (and others) without him knowing. He also gave as an assignment to track every food we ate everyday for a few days. Which isn't necessarily horrible, but for people suffering from eating disorders such an assignment would be horrible. For the last recitation my TA hinted that we should voice concerns during course evaluation.\n\nI just stuck with the class because it was an easy A and I didn't have to pay attention during lecture.",

The TA told us we could make up a weight but we had to measure height, arm circumference, triceps skin fold measurements etc. It was so that we could learn about body mass indexing. What still felt violating is that other students in the class had to be the ones to measure us. All in all it was a weird experience",

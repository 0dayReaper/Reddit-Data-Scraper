    "postText": "Hi! I was wondering if we're allowed to decorate our cap or if it's even a thing. Online it says Penn \"discourages\" it but it's not disallowed. Further, I'm concerned about being the only one with a decorated cap. I'd appreciate any insight! \n\nI'm excited to decorate my cap because my HS didn't even let us wear cords let alone decorate anything. Any guidance would be appreciated",

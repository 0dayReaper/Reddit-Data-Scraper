            "comment": "The College Butler is definitely reliable and last year they said most the delays were due to new parking rules for trucks that made them park many blocks away from the residences. This year they are officially the recommended company through Penn ResLife and will have better access to parking and the dorms and all compared to last year which caused a lot of the delays. I\u2019ll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they will probably be more punctual this year",

    "postText": "Coming out of undergrad with a year of internship experience at a top missile company\n\nWanted to pivot towards Product Design route for consumer facing products\n\nGot into Penn IPD and Berkeley MDes\n\nBerkeley will cost 60k for 1.5 years (3 sem program; will TA 20hr/week) and Penn will cost 130k for 2 years. No scholarships so far.\n\nMy main goal is to have a startup.  I'm of the understanding that the Penn network can help land VC deals\n\nFall back is a PM/PD tech job which also Penn can (low-key) guarantee\n\nWill the ROI be worth it with &gt; 130k in student loans?",

Yes there are plenty of great resources to learn more and build something for yourself but that\u2019s a large and vaguely defined scope as your reasoning. Great ideas attract VC deals but I wouldn\u2019t weight network for VC deals into your selection before you even have a start up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nid also be careful saying Penn can low key guarantee you PM/PD tech job. At top compansies it was still a lot of my top performing friends who got the jobs. Penn might have been some nice polish to their resume or helped facilitate an introduction but I think they would\u2019ve gotten the same positions had they gone to any other top schools.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwith a year of internship experience I\u2019d consider working a little longer or trying to pivot without going back to school first.",

If I\u2019m taking on six figures of debt, it has to be for a house\u2014which you may never be able to afford if you\u2019re in the hole $130k for a masters.\n\n\nI\u2019d find a job in the field, build out experience / network / resume, and let them pay for a masters.",

(In some cases, advanced preparation might actually make you worse off.)\n\nIntro econ is not math-y at all... at most, some arithmetic.  Do you understand basic subtraction and division?  If so, you good.\n\nIntermediate and advanced courses, however, are a different story once they make use of calculus.",

Lowest midterm score was dropped so I basically didn\u2019t have to study for one of them (don\u2019t recommend this tho lol). There\u2019s no math but tbh in Econ, the math makes the concepts easier not harder.\n\nPre studying rarely works for Penn classes tbh esp if u have never taken a Penn class before and don\u2019t know what the typical course structure is. Enjoy ur summer, pls don\u2019t study cuz u will be sufficiently overburdened when u get here lmao.",

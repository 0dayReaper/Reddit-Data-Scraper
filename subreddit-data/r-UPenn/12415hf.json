    "postText": "Dear Members of the Penn Community,\n\n\n\nAs you may know, the City of Philadelphia has reported a spill of a latex product occurred in the Delaware River and may have the potential to affect the water supply in some parts of Philadelphia. The city has reported that all water remains safe to drink at this time. There is no need to buy water at this time. Residents can fill bottles or pitchers with tap water with no risk at this time.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, they have reported that the University\u2019s campus (19104 Zip Code) does not fall within the potentially impacted area. The Philadelphia Water Department provided a map to show the areas which may be impacted by the spill, found here: https://phillyh2o.info/spill-map\n\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Water Department continues to monitor and test potentially affected water sources. They will be providing an update this afternoon.\n\n\n\nDetails about the spill are available on the City of Philadelphia Water Department homepage: https://water.phila.gov/\n\n\n\nYou may also follow the City of Philadelphia\u2019s Water Department, Mayor\u2019s Office, and Office of Emergency Management or DPS on Twitter for updates: @PhillyH2O, @PhiladelphiaGov, @PhilaOEM, @PennDPS, as well as the DPS website http://www.publicsafety.upenn.edu\n\n\n\nThank you,\n\nPublic Safety",

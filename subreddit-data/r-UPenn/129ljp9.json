Two days after returning home I got the admission letter from Penn. My father went to Penn for debtal school and I would love to go. I worry about mental health issues I keep reading about triggered by acdemic and social pressure and \u201ccutthroat\u201d attitudes. Anyone in premed can  collaborate?",

            "comment": "hi! premed here. i think\u2013and i think this is true of pretty much any school\u2013a lot of pressure and cutthroat attitudes is determined by the people who you surround yourself with. penn is big enough that if you do happen to meet any toxic people, you can choose not to interact with them. personally i\u2019ve been surrounded by the most wonderful, amazing, and supportive people here at my time at penn, and i\u2019m sure many others here would say the same. \n\nregarding mental health issues, i\u2019m inclined to believe that while going to college might exacerbate it, a lot of people probably had some level of mental health issues before coming here. college in general is an important time to exercise kindness towards yourself and to others, and build up support networks you can turn to in times of stress. a lot of this also comes down to the idea of \u201cpenn face\u201d and the impression that nobody around you is struggling (spoiler alert: almost everyone is). it\u2019s easy to compare yourself to others and worry that you don\u2019t have enough job/internship offers, aren\u2019t in enough clubs, etc etc, but you don\u2019t always know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes. being open &amp; honest about your mental health and reaching out to those you trust is key. but i don\u2019t think that this mental health phenomena is isolated to penn and is in general very prevalent at \u201ctop\u201d universities.\n\noverall, it\u2019ll come down to (financials aside) what school you think is the best choice for *you*. you have two wonderful options and cannot go wrong either way. best of luck! if you have any specific questions about penn as well, feel free to reach out :)",

Visit and see what your gut tells you, if anything. \n\nFwiw i'm here for the vet school and i'm glad i didn't get in for undergrad because this place would have eaten me alive. a smaller school/city was a much better fit at the time but its hard to see that when you're ambitious and trying to get the ivy league on your resume, yknow?",

The catch with USC is that I have scholarships amounting to 76k/yr bringing the COA down to 14k/yr. \n\nShould I take M&amp;T at full price over it if I can barely afford it?",

UPenn MnT is one of the hardest, if not the hardest programs to get into. Coming from a similar situation during my applications previously, I can say that UPenn M&amp;T and Berkeley M.E.T are one of the best programs out there. If you got into M.E.T. you might have something to consider. Otherwise, even though it might seem that the price of M&amp;T is extremely high right now, a few years down the line you won't regret taking it over a scholarship at USC. Penn M&amp;T opens up careers in hedge funds, PE, and quant, and Berkeley M.E.T. in VC, startups, and tech which give out incredible packages so it will be worth it. Again if you are not on a student loan then this makes sense but in the end, it is your decision.",

A lot of people give up MIT, Harvard, etc to do Penn Coordinated Dual Degree programs. But also if you don't wanna go into Finance, or start your own business eventually the economic value is not that much. That being said you don't know what you wanna do now, probably, so I'd pick M&amp;T.",

Anywhere you go, you say your from this program- doors open up, opportunities, open up. Internships.  You are a golden child.

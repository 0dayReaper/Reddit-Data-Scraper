I love the program but I'm extremely worried that I am underprepared for my target language, and I was curious if I could get any course-schedule samples for a hunstman student and/or any advice on if any of you self-studied your target language.",

            "comment": "What language is it? Don\u2019t stress too much, because people in Huntsman enter with varying levels of fluency in their target language! I self-studied my target language and literally entered in the Beginner\u2019s level when I got into Penn, others entered in Advanced - it all depends.\n\nThat being said if you can test into a higher level for your target language (there are placement tests at the beginning of the year), you can get your language requirement over with sooner! I\u2019m stuck taking my target language for 3 years, which gives me less space/time to fulfill my other requirements and take other classes. So if you can self-study and place into intermediate or higher that would be better !!",

If you have even basic Russian under your belt, you\u2019ll be fine. Russian instruction at Penn isn\u2019t fantastic (at least in my experience &gt;10 years ago), but if you\u2019re motivated and practice you\u2019ll be fine",

I'm extremely interested in the huntsman program and a lot of my ECs are centered around language and study abroad.\n\nonly im worried bc huntsman is like a program between CAS and Wharton... and its the wharton part that scares me bc that's a business school and bc this program involves business... that involves calculus....\n\nbut the problem is im not going to be able to take calculus in hs so im scared if i take the shot at applying for huntsman, im gonna get rejected cuz of that. cuz ik you have to have calculus for wharton.... but like im kind of confused bc idk, by the website, it gave off the feel of it being more language-centered than like... math centered.\n\nidk what im asking here. just like, what is the business side to the program? how much math is involved??? do u know anyone who has gotten in without it?\n\ni do go to a feeder school to upenn however (like 30-70 get admitted each year) and a fair amount last year ik didn't take calc. but none of them were huntsman. in fact, only 1 of the people from my school last year was going to huntsman and they took calc so... ugh idk if i should risk applying for huntsman when id have a better shot at getting in with another major...",

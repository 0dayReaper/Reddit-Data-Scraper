But that usually stinks a little and this doesn't, the animals in the pond would likely have died by now if this were algae (red algae produces respiratory and neurotoxins) and as other commenters said there is pretty clear evidence something was poured in there. There's red splatters on the rocks outside the pond. It's not a bad idea; the paint on the rocks just rules it out.",

    "postText": "lately, i've been so overwhelmed with school and have been quite down at an all-time semester low, but i realized that it is because i'm focused on academics that i've faded far away from my friends made during freshman year. it's so so hard to find the balance between academic and social, and i feel like i can basically only choose one or the other. (for context, I study a rigorous STEM major). now that i'm almost done with sophomore year, i feel so lost because i don't really have anyone to turn to, so my sadness doesn't get resolved and i keep get lonelier and lonelier as a result, almost like a negative feedback loop.\n\ni'm trying to get out of this loop but i don't know how because i have basically lost all my friends at this school as a result of this problem and have no one to turn to. all the people i know are just acquaintances now, and i feel like i don't know anything about the people i used to call \"friends\" in freshman year anymore. i am in a couple of clubs but everything seems so pre-professional and goal-oriented, and everything is so superficial and fake. i also tried exploring greek life and everything (i rushed 5 places) but i'd figured it wasn't exactly my scene either and not what i was looking for at the time. i know everyone says that finding friendship takes a lot of effort, and i totally agree. but i believe i have already tried every avenue possible and put in as much effort as i can, yet i am not seeing any results. i am tired of this and have lost the motivation. i'm so lost rn and idk really where to go from here so any advice is appreciated!",

            "comment": "tbh, same, I feel like for most people, it's really a tradeoff between academic and social life, but my advice is that you can maybe focus on strengthening your relationship with just one or two acquaintances or one or two new people who you think will make great friends instead of putting too much effort into knowing everyone in all the clubs. Also, it's really normal to find that your life had been leaning more towards the academic side, which is totally ok, and I think it will help if you relax a little and do what you actually like such as spending time with your family or picking up a hobby instead of stressing too much on the relationships between you and others! I hope this helps",

Maybe plan a little afternoon trip to center city and invite a bunch of the random people you know from school.",

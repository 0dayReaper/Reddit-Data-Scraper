    "postText": "Hi! Prospective student here.\n\nHow hard is it to register for upper-div CS classes as a minor only? Are most classes really full already? Having trouble finding the answer to this online.\n\nFor context, as a prospective CogSci major, seeing that the major only allows 4-5 concentration courses out of the 9 to be a technical course in CS, trying to find out how difficult it would be to take more interesting CS courses without registering for a double major. Thank u!",

The homework structure is quite generous but exams are a bit difficult to make up for it. It\u2019s a useful class, especially if you don\u2019t have a ton of experience with ML or data science, and it does a pretty good job of introducing both.",

Only time I've been surrounded by a lot of extremely rich people in my life.\n\n&gt;- regrets or things you absolutely do not regret doing?\n\nNot getting out more my first year, and not trying more clubs and activities. Before I joined, they had \"pre-orientation\" events. One of them was a hiking trip, definitely should have done that to make friends.",

            "comment": "\n\\- what do you wish you knew before you enrolled? \n\n- i think i wish i would\u2019ve known the level of work that comes with each major. since this is an ivy league school i genuinely thought that every major would have the same level of difficulty. but starting out with a major that i thought i would love on a pre-med track blew my mind and i kind of died. i\u2019m not saying to not do something you have interest in but i also did my major for practicality so i\u2019m actually just considering how worth it the major is rn. \n\n- i also wish i would\u2019ve known that despite you putting in hard work and time to try and reach out to many professors they can still just be pure assholes. i\u2019ve tried to reach out to different professors just to ask them certain things and they\u2019ll either ignore you or respond a bit cold.\n\n\\- what do you hate and love about Penn? (brutal opinions welcomed)\n\n- what i hate about penn is the competition within the school. when i\u2019m there i constantly feel like sharing a small victory in a class feels like bragging and not doing as well in a class as someone else makes me seem as if i\u2019m stupid. i genuinely hate it because many people will thrive off of you doing worse than them so they have a higher chance of receiving an a, or will even mislead you on an answer in a course. i also hate how there\u2019s just so much pressure to be doing a bunch of things at once. my first semester i cared more about my grades and mental health and it just felt like i was so behind because i wasn\u2019t in 50 clubs, top of my class, etc.\n\n- what i love about penn is the school spirit. coming from a high school that lacked a lot of school spirit and different activities to take your mind off of all the stress you feel this school does a pretty good job at it. when the school comes together for different large events, they\u2019re some of the most fun (in my opinion) things you\u2019ll be attending.\n\n- i also love the people, or specifically my people. despite this being an ivy i think this is one of the schools with the most normal/semi-normal people, so as much as it feels like a competition sometimes i also don\u2019t feel like i\u2019m in a void of super wired people.\n\n\\- things I should be wary of?\n\n- i can\u2019t really think of any, maybe just always watch out for who you let into your life. a lot of people will seem nice on the outside but will be the worst people you\u2019ve brought into your life. also be careful of the work hard play hard mentality, if you genuinely don\u2019t have the correct way of balancing it you can potentially prioritize one over the other and be a mess (learned this freshman fall \ud83d\udc94)\n\n\\- culture shocks? social do\u2019s and don\u2019ts?\n\n- i think i\u2019ve experienced a lot of racial polarization, only in the sense that sometimes it seems that certain racial groups will NOT interact with you under certain circumstances. i\u2019m personally more connected with just my racial group so i\u2019m still alright but before penn i would be friends with people from a wide range of cultures so that shocked me. \n\n- in terms of social do\u2019s and don\u2019ts i can\u2019t necessarily think of any. \n\n\\- regrets or things you absolutely do not regret doing?\n\n- one of my biggest regrets is not taking advantage of all the opportunities penn had first semester. i will still adjusting a lot so i kind of stayed in my room after a certain point but there are just so many events, resources, etc. that the school has to offer that i wish i could\u2019ve experienced. however, i did second semester.\n\n- another regret is selling myself short with assuming my major and track and penn, it\u2019s kind of hard to schedule courses you just want to try for fun before you have to declare a major with both of them, but if you have more flexibility really experiment with the courses there bc there\u2019s some great ones! \n\n- something i don\u2019t regret is my social life freshman year, i think i was on the introverted side but when you put yourself out there a bit you will meet some of the best support systems out there! \n\n\\- or any memorable experiences you would like to share!\n\n- one of my favorite events was holi where you basically through dry paint (apologies if i\u2019m wording this wrong) at each other, but it\u2019s just such a fun thing to do. you get to see the cultural dances, spend time with your friends, it\u2019s great! \n\ncongrats on transferring to penn! i\u2019m also an incoming sophomore so pls lmk if you have any more questions",

                            "comment": "certain courses, im not sure if all have a certain amount of a\u2019s that can be be permitted from what i learned. so my theory on this or just how some penn students work in general is that they can genuinely be trying to do better with you, or pull you down. for being top of the class just naturally means being within a higher A range than most students how may be performing average or below. being in a bunch of clubs is created by the pre professional nature of penn, it\u2019s normalized to be doing a lot of things at once on top of classes which i think can be toxic at a point bc not only do some people join things just for the resume booster they also end up hurting their mental health bc they don\u2019t really enjoy it. i think that a lot of people consistently only talk about classes and grades there which annoys me bc that\u2019s what i\u2019m thinking about a lot so why carry it to like dinner lol.. but there are some people like how you described but not all! pls lmk if this makes sense! \n\nno problem :)",

The more I read about the pre professional culture, the more I dread the possibility of being sucked into it. Kinda scared that nearly everyone would be pretentious and superficial, but I know I shouldn\u2019t doubt before I find out for myself. \n\nAnd having a limit on how many A\u2019s can be given is new to me. That\u2019s so strange and honestly does not make sense to me at all. It just sounds like an instigator for competition rather than a true way of gauging a student\u2019s success (though grades obv do not determine worth)",

Only exception was hill atrium was kinda social but other than that the dorms r dead. Most of my friends came from classes and collaborating on problem sets.\n\nIt\u2019s also cuz of the way a lot of Penn dorms r constructed.

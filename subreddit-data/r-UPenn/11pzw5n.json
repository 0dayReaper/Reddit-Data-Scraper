    "postText": "In NETS, and want to dabble in some physics (perhaps minor). I got a 5 on Mech and EM which gives me credit for the classes, but I know that they are highly rated on PCR, so I was wondering if they were worth taking again (or if I should just review some and explore higher level / more specific classes).\n\nSidenote: I know adv reg is in a while but course planning is my form of procrastination",

Also (this may be outdated) they let honors track students skip the 200 level courses which are/were trash (may also be outdated)\n\nBe warned though, the courses are gnarly unless you are at a physics olympiad level of skill, but they are curved to median A- in the end.",

            "comment": "I second what was already said about them being intense courses with a high workload, but they're definitely enjoyable if physics c was your jam (you essentially do most of physics c in the first week and a half). It's not an easy A but it's probably a safe one. That being said, if you're not a physics major or don't really have a passion for physics, I don't think you should take it, especially because you already have credit. They're highly rated because the class tends to be full of physics majors and the style/material/class appeals to them.",

Do you think that other physics classes (especially those related to biophysics / comp physics) are of similar quality, or is there a course quality drop-off after honors physics kind of like there is with CIS 160?",

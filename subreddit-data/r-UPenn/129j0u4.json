    "postText": "Hey everyone, I just got accepted to the Biotechnology Program at the University of Pennsylvania and I couldn't be more excited. I was hoping to connect with some alumni from the program and ask them a few questions. Here are some things I'm curious about:\n\n1. What do you think of the program? Would you recommend it to others?\n2. How did the program help you in your career?\n3. Were there any particularly difficult aspects of the program?\n4. Which courses or professors were particularly memorable or impactful for you?\n\nI really appreciate any advice or insights you can provide. Thank you in advance!",

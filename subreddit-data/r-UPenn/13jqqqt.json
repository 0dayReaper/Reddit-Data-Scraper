    "postText": "As the title states, I\u2019m not in any scholars program. No bfs all the way to no dual degree coordinated program. I know I have a shot after my freshman year at Penn, but I worry that it will be more competitive since there will be limited spots. \n\nI have always thought that being in an \u201chonors\u201d equivalent program would be more beneficial. Would you guys say so too? I feel pretty discouraged even before stepping on campus \ud83e\udd72 because other students are in such wonderful programs",

            "comment": "It absolutely does not matter in the long run. Only a small percentage of students are part of any such programs, compared to the large percentage of students who were probably honors students in high school. You got into Penn, and that is a major achievement in itself, after all. So these programs very little bearing on your success on campus beyond a couple classes in your curriculum you may not have taken otherwise. (Whether or not that can get you more opportunities, is really up to you to take the reins and/or \"sell\" your story.)\n\nIn fact, a lot of my friends in BFS found it to be extra work and a greater inconvenience as these programs are also very restrictive. However, BFS is very different from a dual degree, so it's interesting that you would mention them in the same sentence - you say it's \"beneficial,\" but beneficial for what purpose? I hope that you had a specific goal in mind when applying to these programs, rather than hoping to join for the prestige and the name, or otherwise you probably won't get anything meaningful out of the program to begin with.\n\nThere are so many doors at Penn - not just academic programs, but clubs and societies and career opportunites - that you will get accepted to, but maybe not get accepted to. Everyone will be doing their own thing based on their own goals. Some sound impressive on paper, some may just be passion projects that don't see much of an outcome. But to compare yourself to others is always going to be a very slippery slope to demotivation and unhappiness on campus. So please don't put yourself down before even coming to Penn. You may even be glad you didn't enroll a couple years down the line when you have more freedom or flexibility to pursue other fields you're interested in.",

I\u2019m a junior who\u2019s also not doing BFS, dual degree, double major, etc. Most students are the same way, and there is no issue with it at all.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t try to get in some honors program just to be in an honors program. If you are applying to one, it should be because that program is specifically the best option for YOU.",

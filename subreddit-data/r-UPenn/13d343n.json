Do you still get to be a college student basically or is the workload just too heavy? I\u2019m also a part of the JWS program so should I even be thinking about a physics dual degree or should I go for a minor?",

The physics major is one of the largest (in terms of required credits) and many of those credits are arguably useless even within physics (the entire standard sophomore year curriculum). Take 170-171 if it\u2019s offered and take quantum or whichever other classes you are interested in, but the degree itself will take up all free space in your schedule with a bunch of bad courses.\n\nP.S. it it probably easier to dual major in math and ask your advisor to approve some physics courses towards the math major, as the math major is only 13 credits and some of those are electives + standard calc/LinAlg sequence you would need to take anyways to take the physics classes you are interested in",

[Here\u2019s a blog by someone who did a math major and wharton degree.](https://undergrad.wharton.upenn.edu/academics/completing-uncoordinated-dual-degree/). As you can tell, if you plan ahead and double count courses between the wharton requirements and college requirements, it\u2019s doable. I think this person\u2019s wharton concentration was stat, so if you pick something else, you might have a couple more courses (though they did stat 101 and 102 for the requirement but you can do 430 and 431 which both count for the math major). Definitely possible with minimal over loading",

Before pursuing the major, ask yourself why you want to pursue that. Is that out of academic interest? Do you want to be a physics researcher? I found you are also a JWS. Many JWS people research on how social science interacts with business. JWS and physics research are quite different. It sounds like you have lots of academic interests and you may not have time to do all. You need to reserve bandwidth for social and forthcoming opportunities.\n\nIf you are interested in machines like those of Tesla, perhaps a dual degree in Mech Eng... similar degrees may be for SSE, CIS, EE, etc.\n\nIf your goal is physics research or academic, go for PHYS degree. But be prepared to be a PhD.\n\nSome found data science to be interesting. Then she completed WH degree in 6 semesters and then submat into Master of Data Science. It's comparatively less course work than a dual degree, and also less prestige. What I mean is that you need to reserve bandwidth for further endeavors, unless you are sure of your path.",

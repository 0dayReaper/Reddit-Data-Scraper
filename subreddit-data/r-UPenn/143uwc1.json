I have two questions: does it matter if I start with Chem 1011 or 1012 if I have a very limited chem background? My school only offered honors chem but it was pretty watered down, so I know I should be taking 1011 but somebody told me that the courses are actually super similar, so it doesn't make a difference. Also, Cirri teaches 1011 (heard bad things) and Mallouk teaches 1012 (heard good things) and Cirri's doesn't really fit in my schedule unless I get rid of my freshman seminar. Also, does chemistry have a lab? When I scheduled bio in there I had to put a lecture + lab + rec but for chem I only see lecture + rec and no lab, even though my premed reqs say I need a lab. Thank you!",

I think it's definitely possible if you study smart and utilize the right resources! I didn't have mallouk, but I've also heard good things about him. chem 1012 also has a lab, which is Chem 1101. be sure to sign up for that too!",

I heard Mallouk tends to have easier exams (even though Cirri curves better I think??) and tends to be more interesting during his lectures (sometimes even singing to the class LMAO) and the only benefit of Cirri is that he sometimes will throw organic chem into the mix so it gives you more background in that. I also heard 1012 covers the same stuff as 1011 except 1011 has longer class time, so I\u2019m looking into taking Mallouk\u2019s class.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve heard that, at places like CMU and MIT, almost everyone is willing to lend a helping hand and the environment is very collaborative and non-competitive (everyone is stressed TOGETHER but works together as well to try and help everyone succeed). Is Penn CS like this? One thing I\u2019m worried about is I saw that some cs homework assignments specifically prohibit you from working with others\u2026 (might have misinterpreted this) which really worried me (is this even true lol?). To follow up, another big question I have in general is: do CS people often do work and study in groups or alone?",

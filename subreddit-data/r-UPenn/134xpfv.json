    "postText": "I am thinking about applying to the MA program and wanted the inside scoop on what it is like in the department. Is it collegial? Not sure if this is on the website but does anyone know the acceptance rate? I know there are approximately 70 graduate students total. It wasn\u2019t clear how long it takes to get the MA degree from the website - I think it\u2019s one year. I am a writer who majored in political science for undergrad, and I kind of missed that majoring in English undergrad experience. So I want to try to recreate some of that. Any insight into the program is much appreciated.",

            "comment": "i cant speak for the graduate english program specifically, but i can speak for the undergrad english department at penn. the undergrad english department here is very strong and close-knit, so it's likely that you will become familiar with a select few professors in specific sectors of english (medieval, contemporary, etc. a lot of professors specialize in different things). they are all very knowledgeable in their field domain, and generally are very good at teaching students the theory behind their class topic. i've had very positive interactions with all of the english professors i've had so far, and i assume that it'll be similar experience in the graduate english department.",

    "postText": "so i'm wondering how best to make friends i guess? and just meet people in general? that sounds so lame but idk what to do so i'm coming to trusty ole' reddit. my experience with penn so far has been kinda backwards tbh. like i started in 2020 during covid, but somehow my freshman year was my favorite year. maybe the best year of my life if i'm being honest. i met so many people, and even though the situation wasn't ideal, i made a lot of friends and genuinely enjoyed college life at that time. and then it sort of went downhill from there. cut to two years later and things have changed to the point where it's all become almost unrecognizable. i changed my major like a gajillion times and went between three out of the four schools in this goddamn place. my friends from freshman year have all gone their separate ways (at the time we all thought we'd be best friends for life). and i get it, like life happens, people grow apart, fall out of love, etc. but, idk,,, i look at myself in the mirror sometimes and just think 'who tf even am i now?' and i'm just at the point where i really wanna meet new people and 'start over' with friends / relationships as much as i can at least. any tips on where to start?",

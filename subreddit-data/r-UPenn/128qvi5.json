    "postText": "Coming out of my undergrad with my bachelors in data analytics and 3 years of experience as a data technician. I really love map making and a lot of the work in the course seems interesting, but I just can\u2019t seem to convince myself that it\u2019s worth it given the less expensive and remote options available. If I generally just teach myself, what\u2019s the use of an Ivy League degree? Just looking for some guidance or input since this program would give me a masters four years out of high school and that alone is overwhelming.",

            "comment": "At times it can be lonely, I will admit that. I do want to say two things though. 1) You\u2019re a freshman, you still have time to explore your groups/clubs/friends. People still join clubs/frats/friend groups sophomore year, even junior year. The thing is, you have to put effort into wanting to join those things. Go to PennClubs or talk to your friends to see what interests you and apply. If nothing works out, there\u2019s option 2. 2) Embrace your hobbies/passions that you enjoy alone. Whether it be TV/movies, walking/running, reading, or playing video games, just enjoy what you do alone. Not that this means to give up interaction all together, but it just means that you need to find the things you\u2019re passionate about. Eventually you\u2019re going to run into another person that\u2019s equally passionate about those things. Chances are you\u2019re still growing as a person, and so are others, you just need time for it to click.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal to feel lonely. It\u2019s difficult to get out of that hole, but it\u2019s not impossible. You also have 3 more years to grow in undergrad.",

What ultimately worked for me is I did a semester in DC through the Penn in Washington program, and that is how I met my first real friends and found thing like Philo that ultimately gave me a sense of place. So to echo the advice that was given earlier, think about what you're passionate about and then see what kinds of organizations or programs there are in that area. I'll also say, if you're having trouble connecting with others, or putting yourself out there, it may be worth a visit to the mental health folks on campus, or if the feeling of loneliness are starting to impact your ability to function. College can really, really change your mental state, and in my case, it brought out clinical depression that made things much harder. I wish, in retrospect, I'd reached out for support sooner than I did, because it probably would have saved me a lot of anguish trying to deal with my depression on my own.",

    "postText": "Hi Reddit,\n\nIncoming freshman at Penn Engineering here; I have a few questions about first-year dorm choices. Brief summary of my goals:\n\n1. Good facilities (just nothing awful to live in)\n2. Social life--I'm very much a social person (nothing too quiet) but I also don't think I'm the type to party hard.\n3. Vicinity to classes--this is nice, but the other two criteria are far more important to me. Ordering would be something like hill-&gt;lauder-&gt;KCECH-&gt;quad\n\nWhat are the best places to dorm off of these criteria? I've been told by an alum I know that Hill was awful, but it's also been renovated since if I understand correctly. I've been thinking KCECH, but I also keep hearing conflicting takes on whether or not it has a good social scene. Lastly, with Lauder being changed to first-year only next year, it's tempting (best facilities, close to my classes), but I'm unsure of how the social scene will look with no empirical evidence to reference. Any advice would be appreciated :)",

For engineers it is literally the perfect location. \n\nPenn isn't a big campus so you will be just fine going to a party by walking 5 minutes on locust walk. I don't think living in lauder will be an issue. But yes, lauder itself didn't have parties and was mostly quiet and peaceful before. But since it's all freshman next year it will see a big cultural shift for sure.\n\nOverall, I would totally recommend Lauder as the first choice. I'm sad I can't go back to lauder next year.",

            "comment": "Hey, I lived in Lauder freshman and sophomore year, and I can tell you it\u2019s not very social. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but that means you should room with your friends or people you know if you can, and try to make your dorm feel homey. You may also need to be more proactive to meet the other kids on your floor.\n\nLauder and Hill are as close to engineering and DRL as it gets (literally right across the street) and considering you are in SEAS, that will be very important for late night work days/early mornings. I would recommend it.",

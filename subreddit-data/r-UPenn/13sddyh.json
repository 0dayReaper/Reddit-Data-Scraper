Is there any way to expedite this (even with an electronic one) before this? I would need it quite soon. A letter would not be sufficient unfortunately.",

It will say in the top left of the first page that the degree was awarded on May 15 (if you're a Spring grad). You can generate an unofficial transcript to check and make sure your graduation has processed. If it doesn't show a degree awarded then your program hasn't finished the graduation checkout process. Reach out to them to see if you can get that expedited. Also make sure what you're sending them is official. Don't open the file in any way, ideally have it sent directly to them.\n\nThere are e-diplomas, but getting a diploma expedited is way harder than getting your transcript to show your degree.",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nMy younger brother decided to visit campus last weekend. While I was showing him around, he needed to take a dump. So I guided him to a restroom in Van Pelt. Long story short, his poop ended up clogging the toilet, and now he\u2019s panicking he will get rescinded for the inconvenience he caused. So as the title says, my question is will my younger brother get rescinded?\n\nThanks all and have a good evening!\n\n(If it wasn\u2019t obvious, this is a joke post)",

Not sure where else to ask this in.. \n\n[But I was searching the archives](https://dparchives.library.upenn.edu) and I couldn't find the article, does anyone remember this, or the title? There were so many hundreds of possibilities and honestly the search function is extremely limited. Thanks!",

But if I could speculate, since Jesus was a devout practitioner of Judaism when he was alive/when he died, I can't see any reason as to why he wouldn't continue to practice Judaism were he alive today.",

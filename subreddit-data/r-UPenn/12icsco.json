    "postText": "TW: mental health and illnesses, suicide\n\nThere is such a strong pre-professional culture at Penn (and even the highschool I graduated from) and it has been pretty discouraging. Like, everyone has great internships or research programs for freshman and sophomore years. Currently a sophomore with nothing coming up for the summer; there are part-time positions or work-study jobs I can put down on my resume for the summer but they are unpaid or give me barely any work. I'm struggling hard with several mental illnesses, and seeing that literally every other Penn student I know is successful and has something great lined up for the summer is really depressing. I also don't like the type of internships I'm applying for, but I have to continue applying for them because that's the only area I have experience in. It also feels like it's too late to change career directions since sophomore year is ending. On top of that, my mental illnesses tend to paralyze me, which slows my progress a lot and makes it hard to find my interests (it might not make sense but it's true--long story). CAPS and additional therapy have helped, but progress is slow.\n\nI do have a strong interest in research, and have some limited experience. I don't have a research program lined up unfortunately. I was thinking of studying Python and R over the summer/reading research literature while continuing the research position I have right now (prof barely gives me work even if I ask but better than nothing ig) but that feels pathetic and is probably not enough. It would be OK if I was a freshman, but I'm a sophomore already. And I only have junior year left to stack up my CV before I start applying for grad school senior year. I also discovered new academic topics recently that I'm very interested in (more so than current research) and I'm applying to the lab that studies it for the fall. But I'm likely to be rejected since the profs are not sure if there will be a spot and I don't have much relevant experience since it's a new interest. \n\nI know this is a shitty thing to say, but with career anxiety I've been seriously contemplating suicide recently. By all objective metrics, in both pre-professional areas and research, I'm behind compared to others at Penn. I discovered things I'm interested in a little too late. Life is too stressful to be worth it and the only thing holding me back from trying to commit is the fear of failing the attempt and living with the scars. \n\nCan one of you physics people help me freeze time \ud83d\ude2d",

Life is not a race and you have plenty of time and opportunities. Most importantly, reach out to a suicide hotline for assistance with your anxiety (1-800-SUICIDE)",

Overcoming mental illness is no easy feat, and the overwhelming feeling of doom and thoughts of suicide is not something that anyone should ever have to live with, and is not a normal thing.\n\nPlease, please reach out to the suicide hotline or reach out to any other mental health facility asap.\n\nPlease take care of yourself by reaching out.",

I was supposed to intern at the CIA the summer before my senior year and found out in May of my junior year that it wasn\u2019t happening because of Trump\u2019s hiring freeze. Being an FGLI student from the rural deep south I did not have the time or resources to find something else, so I was a Hooters girl that summer instead. 5 years after graduating I am excelling in my career, loving what I do and where I\u2019m at. Hang in there. Your path may be bumpier and different than the typical Penn student\u2019s but you will find your way",

            "comment": "Hey! Just wanted to say that you\u2019re not alone here- I know a fair number of people with no summer plans (and even some graduating seniors with no long-term plans at all yet due to difficulties finding jobs). If you haven\u2019t already looked into this, I would consider making an appointment with someone at CURF to try to find an available route to research for you. I was able to make a next-day appointment with an upper-level staff member at CURF by trawling through their website, and I believe they have walk-in peer advising.\n\nAs to the mental health aspect, I\u2019ve also struggled quite a lot with mental illness, preprofessional culture, and suicidal thoughts in my time here. Penn is a really small part of a long life, and the things that do or don\u2019t happen here won\u2019t be impossible to fix. Something I\u2019ve thought about a lot is taking a gap semester to find my interests and try to ground myself- if that feels like an option it might be worth considering. I would also second the other commenter\u2019s message- please reach out to the suicide hotline or any of Penn\u2019s crisis resources if you need to. You\u2019ve got this!",

You\u2019re in a disproportionately high achieving environment; that environment doesn\u2019t breed any lasting happiness. Take it easy on yourself and don\u2019t let yourself be roped in. \n\nJust as keeping up with the Jones doesn\u2019t breed financial or emotional stability and contentment, getting sucked into the Penn bubble doesn\u2019t do anyone any favors. \n\nReach out to CAPS; the Penn insurance is really good and you should be able to find a HCP to speak with.\n\nAlso: many of these high-achieving people are absolutely miserable in their personal lives.\n\nThey are checking prestige boxes in a race to the top. Keep in mind that things are not always as they appear for your peers and classmates (see: social media).",

            "comment": "I would like to say that research and internships are not the only way you can demonstrate your interest in a field. I recently became interested in traveling to different parts of the world and have known a few of my friends who have taken gap years to pursue their own passions, sometimes through visiting the world and gaining different perspectives. Just because you don't have all the necessary relevant research experience doesn't mean that you can't find a lab. And don't feel like you're stuck on one path. I've known people who have completely shifted careers from med school to grad school or even became a chef after graduation despite their background suggesting otherwise. So you have all the time you need to decide what you ultimately like.\n\nI didn't officially start at my current research lab at Penn until junior year and really enjoy working with my PI and grad students on their research projects as well as my own small independent research. The fit in the lab is definitely something you need to always consider. If you don't feel like your PI is at least somewhat encouraging of your work or that he/she doesn't inspire confidence in you, then you may want to consider discussing with your professor about your feelings working in their lab and whether you're comfortable with them. If for some reason you realize you don't like working in their lab, you can always leave. Most professors won't take it personally and will understand your circumstances if you don't like to continue researching in their lab.\n\nFinding hobbies or different extracurricular interests are great ways to destress and not focus so much on \"pre-professional\" culture. If you like to play a sport, cook/bake, play music, etc., it'll be a great way to show you that there's more to Penn and life in general than just the next goal. And if you feel like you can't find a particular activity to cling to, just ask around! Many clubs and organizations are eager and willing to accept new members and show them the works, even if they've never had any experience before.",

Please DM me if you want someone to talk to. I will say that getting away from Penn, even for a summer, will help a lot with the constant feelings of comparison and that you aren\u2019t doing well enough. You\u2019re so young, and ultimately the marginal difference in career opportunities or prestige, etc, are not what really make you happier in life and are not what you are going to care about in the future. You are not behind in any way. As unimaginable as it sounds even if you were to leave school on medical leave for a year, you would end up being just fine. Give yourself grace.",

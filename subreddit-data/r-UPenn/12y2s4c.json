    "postText": "Hello! I am attending Penn this fall (co 2027 studying at CAS!) and am contemplating whether or not I should apply for the Benjamin Franklin Scholars Program. I have a few questions:\n\n1. If I were to join the program, am I able to drop the program anytime I want? Or do I have to stick to this program for the entire school year and drop it next school year?\n2. From my understanding, members of BFS can only room with others in the same program. If I were to drop this program halfway through the school year, how would roommates work? Do I continue to room with the same person or do I have to change roommates/move out? \n3. Is this program worth it/doable? Has being in the BFS Program somehow helped you get internships, jobs, get into graduate school (like med school for me), etc? I really like the idea of being a part of a tight-knit community and taking classes that are interdisciplinary, but as a person that wants to go the premed track, I am unsure if the amount of time commitment (I heard BFS classes consist of lots of readings + papers) is worth it in the end since I also hope to get involved with clubs + have a social life inside &amp; outside of school while fulfilling those premed &amp; gened requirements. All I've heard is that the BFS program is not recommended for those going on the premed track.\n\nAny advice/insight is helpful and appreciated!! Thanks in advance :)",

            "comment": "1. you enroll in courses per semester so you'd have to stick with the courses that semester (unless you drop before the drop deadline). you could not decide to do the 3 bfs seminars after doing ISP freshman year but that'd be a lot of work freshman year not to graduate with the program\n2. I think you just room in hill? doesn't have to be someone in BFS\n3. if you're doing the program for the 'prestige,' it's not worth it. but I had a good experience in bfs as a pre-med. we got to take courses I wouldn't have taken otherwise, and you get access to really great professors. the courses themselves are very solid; the professors/teaching team puts a lot of thought and work into it. I thought the program was challenging in a good way, it definitely pushed the way I think and made me a much better writer + made some really good friends. I definitely think you can still do bfs + be premed + be a normal college student but if you hate reading or writing then it probably isn't for you (ik multiple premeds in bfs that ended up double majoring, don't let someone tell you it clunks down your schedule forever).\n\nbfs gets this rap (mostly from ppl that weren't in the program...) for being so awful and impractical and hard and mb the program has gotten exponentially worse since I was in it, but genuinely I thought it was so fine and shaped my freshman yr in a rly positive way. like not to get all sentimental and sappy but it was a very formative experience to get to college, be pushed to engage rigorously w an academic field and actually think, and have someone value what you have to say. the profs are some of the best at penn and have signed up for isp bc they want to teach freshmen and hear from them.\n\nI learned a lot and when I compare the classes 'you have to take' w the random classes my other friends took freshman year, I don't feel like I missed out at all (the opposite actually). if you're premed you'll be taking classes like chem101, bio101 and writing sem freshman yr \u2014 isp is a welcome change. i'll prob never get a chance to take classes like isp again and it's nice bc freshman yr is the time to explore and do that.",

            "comment": "Lots of people r asking this, I think I elaborated more in a prior comment.\n\nBasically I\u2019ve heard for the most part it\u2019s a nuisance that clogs up ur schedule if ur in CAS. There\u2019s negligible prestige benefit. U will have more freedom to take interesting classes if u don\u2019t do it. If ur doing a double major def don\u2019t do it cuz ISP takes up like half of ur freshman schedule. \n\nU don\u2019t have to move out if u drop lol. U can def have a social life if u do it\u2014the workload isn\u2019t this heavy. Just tbh I prefer taking classes I want to take and there r so much variety at Penn it\u2019s kinda a shame to be restricted by a program that won\u2019t really help u all that much.\n\nI got BFS when I got into Penn but declined cuz I was gonna do Econ/cs so with bfs that would put me behind.\n\nOnly positive of bfs I think is that u get hill which imo has the toughest knit freshman community.",

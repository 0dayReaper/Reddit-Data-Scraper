At the time, I worked with Neal Lemon, but it looks like he has since moved to another insitution. There are current contacts listed here [https://pci.upenn.edu/inventors/disclose-your-inventions/](https://pci.upenn.edu/inventors/disclose-your-inventions/) \n\nBest of luck!!",

Go to uspto.gov to start, and then you can hire a broader search firm. \n\nPatents aren't what you think they are. Your invention may only be partly unique, and what's patentable may be a smaller part of the utility or process.",

    "postText": "Hi, incoming Wharton freshman, I was wondering if I could have some advice on my housing college rankings list as well as some more information on gender inclusive housing. Does it increase the chance of getting a certain college house as your potential number of roommates increase or can you only be matched with others who select the option. Thanks in advance. \n\n1.Lauder, 2. Gregory, Du Bois, Stouffer, KCEH, Ware, Fisher, 8. Hill",

            "comment": "for gender inclusive housing, you can either be matched with people of all the same identifying gender, or be selected into a dorm that is gender inclusive. the former only needs all members to be of the same identifying gender, while the latter requires that everyone selected \"gender inclusive\" on their application. in general, this does give you a *bit* more wiggle room of what dorm you want, although it's not a total game changer.",

Forms that are not only for freshman will be lonely and you will not have a group of friends \u2014 especially if you enjoy going out at night or on the weekends",

I would really prefer a single/ suite.",

    "postText": "I have been experiencing some psychological issues as of late. I don't know how the Counseling Services at Penn. Can someone please guide me on how to make an appointment with a therapist in the CAPS center? I don't want to go for the walk-in sessions. Also, Can anyone talk about their experiences? Is it worth going there?",

            "comment": "Give CAPS a call and they can schedule you in for a session with a CAPS therapist! Usually the first session is just to learn about your background and then the next few sessions are about the issues you are dealing with. After a few sessions with CAPS, You can either continue with CAPS or find a full-time professional (usually in Philly), which I believe costs $10 per session. In my experience, CAPS has been really helpful in dealing with some issues and I have been with a local professional for a while now. I think there are a lot of valid critiques of CAPS that you will hear about but it is still nonetheless a good resource imo! Best of luck going forward and lmk if I can help in any way",

            "comment": "CAPS can be very hit or miss. They absolutely helped me through a difficult time in my life, and I would die for my therapist, but I also know that she's not the norm at CAPS, and they can definitely have some issues. Regardless, I would say that they're a good first try, especially after watching people I know at Penn try to find therapists outside of CAPS that are covered by PSIP.",

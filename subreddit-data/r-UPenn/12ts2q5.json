    "postText": "I was looking at the course description and a lot of the topics covered seem to be topics that are covered in undergrad math classes (SVD, Fourier Series, Eigenvalue Problems,etc)but the difficulty rating on PennCourseReview is a 3.2. I was just wondering if anyone could speak to the difficulty and how similar it is to some of the undergrad classes.",

            "comment": "It's a math course that is/was? required for meam PhD students and when I took it that was pretty much the only people in it. It's probably rated hard because most us meam undergrad programs don't require a lot of math. (My undergrad math req stopped at diff eq/linear Algebra). It's more rigorous/theoretical compared to those classes which were largely computational at my school. Also you seem to be an undergrad, I would recommend just taking an actual undergrad math dept class if you want more math.",

I would have to take 6, 5, 5, 5 Cus over the next 4 semesters. One of my issues is keeping the number of masters classes equal to or less than the number of undergraduate classes so I\u2019m having to shift classes around in my schedule. \nIf I was to get my hands on the textbook and study it over the summer, do you think that might make enough of a difference? From what you have said, it sounds tough but doable.",

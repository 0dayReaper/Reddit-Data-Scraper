    "postText": "I am an incoming 20 y old graduate student in the MS Robo program at Upenn. I was wondering what options there are for housing as ideally I don't want to limit myself to interaction with just other graduate students (although I wouldn't mind :) ). I am assuming I can't stay on campus, but are there any off campus options that are a solid middle ground between undergrads and graduate students? I will have a car if that helps.",

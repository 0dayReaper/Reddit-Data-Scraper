    "postText": "STOP. You know who you are. There have been several parties broken up in the last few days. STOP passing your cards to other people. STOP pretending that COVID restrictions don't apply to you. Even if you're lucky enough to not get others sick, what if you get sick? What if you end up at HUP?\n\nWho the **hell** do you think you are? We're guests in this community. **None of us had to come here**. Respect the community or go the fuck home. This isn't a personal decision. If you end up in the hospital because of your shitty behavior, you're exposing more nurses, doctors, techs, and other staff to COVID, many of whom are at high risk for complications. Staff at Penn have spent the better part of 10 months getting things ready for us so that we can try to get back too some semblance of \"normal\". Your willful violations of COVID restrictions are a slap in the face to people who have worked tirelessly to provide for **YOU**. So, wear a mask, keep your distance, wash your hands, **AND STOP PASSING YOUR PENNCARDS TO OTHER STUDENTS**.",

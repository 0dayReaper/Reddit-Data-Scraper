But I would only do it if it's something you're interested in or find useful for your future career because otherwise you could be filling your schedules with other classes besides nutrition courses.",

These are requirements I would have had to fill anyways so they did not add much. You might be able to double count for other minors as well. Plus, I haven't felt as though the nursing major course load was extremely overwhelming in the first place so there's definitely room for additional work!",

None of y'all chose to talk to the DP when they asked. None of y'all are submitting further evidence to the DP's newstip email. You're just spreading rumors online. You're cowards, defending the richest spoiled kids on campus. xoxo",

We won't know anything else, other than assault being reported/investigated and medical records of the injuries sustained, for sure until we get good public information. \n\nThose who are spreading rumors to undermine the story and the victim though deserve a good slap in the face.",

If you're good with languages it's definitely doable, but be aware that college langauge classes do usually move faster than high school ones so getting a head start with Duolingo isn't a bad idea. (I mainly use the app to practice languages I already speak but am also using it to learn a fourth language-German- right now.)",

It's a good free option, but in my experience doesn't compare to actual classroom/formal language instruction. I've been doing German since last September (granted, I do jump between that and practicing my other languages) and while I could certainly get by if I had to have a basic conversation with someone I'd still probably try asking people if they spoke English instead. Don't let one month on Duolingo make you feel like you couldn't learn another language. I didn't go here for undergrad so know very little about the different dorms, but one thing I did when I started learning Spanish that helped was make friends with a native speaker and practice talking with them to see get better and gain some confidence.",

I also suspect it will change significantly this year, because one of the Gregory buildings will be entirely freshmen.\n\nI personally really enjoyed Gregory. There's a cafe in the basement where all the drinks are free, and becoming a regular there is a great way to make friends. Gregory also has loads of events with free food, which I appreciated a lot. I wouldn't call it dull, but Gregory definitely draws a nerdier population to it",

I ended up taking NELC as one of my majors and studied abroad which helped my language skills massively. I don\u2019t consider myself amazing at Arabic but I continue to use it fairly often.\n\nThe way I see it, university language classes build a solid foundation. And as long as you approach your target language with discipline, expose yourself to it in various contexts every day, and are willing to put yourself out there and make (lots of) mistakes, learning a foreign language is 100% doable!",

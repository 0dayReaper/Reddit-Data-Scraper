We accept applicants who are already NREMT certified on a rolling basis, meaning that the acceptance rate often varies and they are evaluated separately from those applying to the spring EMT class we offer. MERT has competitive admissions that change on a year-to-year basis. That being said, applicants who already are certified often have a better chance of being accepted. Feel free to ask any other questions you may have!",

Just be honest, don\u2019t be like those pretentious academic institutions pretending to be the king. \n\nI was interviewed by 7 students with no one at the authority position. They asked me stupid questions like tell me what you see yourself doing in 10 years. What? Why does it matter? You aren\u2019t doing a job interview on me. \n\nEven the application itself is full of crap. It\u2019s the single biggest club manifestation of corrupt student elitism at Penn.",

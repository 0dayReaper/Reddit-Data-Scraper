    "postText": "I've looked in past posts before deciding to post because we've been really stuck on what dorms to choose. We know lauder is the current best freshman option, but even with suites we'd prefer having two people, and lauder doesn't have doubles. I also acknowledge that no dorm is going to fit everything that we are looking for, so best fit would be loved! One of us is Wharton and one of us is CAS if that matters.\n\nHere's some of the things we want/are looking for in choosing a dorm: \n\n* A room for two people big enough to have a computer setup (even better if double monitor though I know that's a crazy hope)\n* Not too far away from general center of campus\n* Social\n* Generally good facilities\n* First year housing preferred  \n\n\nWe are currently at the Quad dorms...is that the best choice and if not, what are some other options?",

As for the social aspect since ur freshmen class is getting split up into more houses since wuad is being renovated I would say most social spot will be the lauder/hill area. I don\u2019t know how much of quad will be gone but if there is still a good amount of quad left for co2027 then it could also be social enough",

Unless you know your roommate well (like years before Penn) I\u2019d reco rooming with others as well. And Lauder is nicest of the options I think.",

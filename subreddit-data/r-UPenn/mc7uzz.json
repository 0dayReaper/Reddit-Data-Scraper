Normally, around moments like this, we fear \"contagion,\" or the idea that heavily reported suicides can cause a spread effect. \n\nThings are incredibly difficult right now, but I promise that you are not alone. Please reach out to CAPS or the abundance of student support services \u2014 I imagine they are linked somewhere here on the subreddit.",

CAPS has been one of the most helpful resources i've used at penn and i 100% support anyone who wants to try it.",

I see and hear a lot of people mentioning CAPS when discussing mental health. While CAPS is obviously not perfect and Penn has lots of mental health issues, it disappoints me when people are purely dismissive of CAPS as a resource on campus.\n\nI am not trying to say that people have not had bad experiences with CAPS, I'm not saying that they didn't fail to answer the phone when you called, but saying things like \"lol caps sucks\" is harmful because it delegitimizes CAPS as a way for people to get help and discourages people from calling CAPS or scheduling an appointment.\n\nCAPS is not perfect, but they gave me a semester of free counseling that was my gateway to more long term therapy. I understand that not everyone has had a good experience, again, I am not discounting the frustrations that people voice.\n\nBut please, if you're criticising CAPS, be more measured, and don't delegitimize it as a way to seek help. The more people see \"CAPS sucks,\" the less likely they are to seek help there.\n\nIf you don't feel right please seek help, whether from a friend, family, CAPS hotline, or something else. Yes, there's a chance CAPS will suck for you, but for me and a lot of other people it was very helpful.\n\nPlease also continue to pressure Penn and CAPS to improve mental health on campus, but please don't delegitimize helpful resources and push people away from them while you do it.",

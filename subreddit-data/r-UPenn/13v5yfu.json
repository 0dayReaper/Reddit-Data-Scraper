    "postText": "I'm thinking about transferring to Penn and considering going to med school as well. I can't decide if I want to do Bioengineering or if I want to do Biology/neuroscience at Penn. I'm wondering about the stress that comes from the school work at the engineering school. Is it really difficult to maintain a 4.0 GPA? Even if it isn't a 4.0 GPA how hard is it to have a good work/life balance? Are there any benefits to doing bioengineering over biology for pre-med? How much difficult is it to be accepted into SEAS over CAS?",

            "comment": "Rising sophomore in neuro!\n\nPretty generic answer but I think the easiest thing to do is what you are more interested in. Personally, I started out with biochem premed and realized that I wasn't interested in taking the pure math/physics/pchem that went beyond premed requirements, so I switched to neuro premed, which has a bit more freedom for classes that intersect with psych/hsoc. I would say  SEAS is harder to get into because of the fact that its smaller than the college and the popularity of the CS major (there aren't official stats, but outside sources give them a similar acceptance rate idk).\n\nAnyway gl on transferring or college (whichever you eventually decide)! Feel free to PM if you want more specifics. I hope you enjoy your freshman year :)",

Would also like to add that bioengineering =/= engineering + biology; instead, we take a class in every engineering major with an added biological perspective. Feel free to DM for details if you would like more information.",

It downgraded or eliminated the idea that applying ED for legacies will increase odds (presumably because it indicates stronger commitment).\n\nThat aside, legacies at the most selective colleges (Ivies) no longer work the way people like to popularly think.  So many top colleges are wary about perception of legacy preference that it almost requires legacies to be stronger than non-legacies.  So whether you have legacy preference or not is irrelevant unless you are no worse than accepted non-legacies.  And if you are - some would say legacies need to be even better to avoid doubt - then it makes the preference marginally more impactful.",

Also that paper used data only for Harvard.

The odds ratio for legacy is 8.5, and it is even larger for double legacies, those on the dean\u2019s interest list, and children of faculty. In a slightly altered model that includes athletes, the odds ratio for athletes exceeds 5,000.\"\n\nSo substantial effects even for those humble \"average legacy\" students, again while controlling for the hundreds of data points on applicant quality that were available.\n\nThe data are from 2009\u201314, that's not terribly long ago, but perhaps there have been sea changes since then.  I'm not convinced the kinds of effects identified in the model have been erased since then, and I would like to see what you can cite to show otherwise. And yeah, it's just Harvard, you got me there. We could still compare things like how much of other universities classes are legacy. A footnote in the paper says\n\n&gt;\"Legacy preferences are relevant at many competitive schools in the United States.Kochkodin (2019) indicates that children of alumni make up 14%, 22%, 18%, and approximately 12% of the 2022 classes enrolled at Princeton, Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina, and Duke University, respectively\"\n\nMy intuition is that other Ivies are going to have more similarities than differences relative to Harvard, but maybe not. I find this argument slightly more compelling than the \"9 years is too old for data\" argument.\n\nI do agree with a point you kind of implied that non mega donor parents aren't that big of a threat to the universities in terms of what they could withhold if they got pissy after legacy is removed. More reason to get rid of it in my opinion.\n\nBut please don't try to say that I'm \"following the wrong trail\" or whatever. It's clearly unfair. And it's easy to change it. And it doesn't seem like it would hurt universities that much in terms of money. Sounds to me like reversing legacy is low-hanging fruit. The authors use their model to estimate how many more students of color would get in if different preferences were stopped. How many more Black kids do you think is enough before it's worth it?\n\nEdit: Furthermore, when we frame it in this way, in terms of the marginal Black kids that get let it, I think it makes it more clear that the \"it's not that big a deal why don't you focus on other things to improve fairness\" argument is more of a \"don't look at the man behind the curtain\" affair.",

But again, even if the older Harvard data is completely apt, how would it confirm that legacy status is strong enough to give a material leg up for \"normal\" (non-mega donor) legacies to be accepted despite being less qualified than superior non-legacies? To the point where it is meaningfully unfair. The popular and convenient \"low hanging fruit\" reasoning goes along the line that based on observable merit a prototypically inferior legacy will have sufficient legacy advantage over a superior non-legacy to be accepted. That was the case at Penn/Ivies of a different era, or at other colleges today that still greatly value alumni givings of non-mega amounts.\r  \n\r  \nMy point which I stated outright is that that's not how legacy advantage works at elite universities today (again referring to regular legacies not megadonors' kids) imho. For the legacy advantage to kick in, they must not be inferior to the non-legacies the school wants to accept. But if they are equivalent, then legacy does become a real advantage... why? because there are more of such 'great' applicants (legacy and non-legacies) than there are available spots. In that final group/pot if you will - where legacies are indistinguishable from non-legacies based on merit - legacies may then gain some preference in priority.  Which is why the statement that they need to be as good or better than great-enough non-legacies. It's a subtle factor akin to element of last resort, but one that stands in contrast with easy posturings that legacy status is akin to magically giving the applicant extra testscore points or extra grade boosts or assuming they have special talent, just because.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I never said legacy has no affect. Just not the way people like to think about it. My view is that today legacy status doesn't help unless you're amongst the strongest candidates to begin with. The low hanging fruit to fix inequity may be more how much of a premium should colleges give athletes in money losing programs, or to non-disadvantaged candidates that fit diversity profiles... but that's a separate discussion.",

If we buy the argument that legacy admissions are good for a university financially (I think it's negligible these days), it seems like maybe other ivies wouldn't be that far off? \n\nThe other thing is that yes, let's fucking hope Harvard is especially egregious, because the numbers in that paper (again, data from 2009-2014, got published last year) are TERRIBLE. When white legacy admissions rates are 34.07%, Penn would have to prefer legacies multiple times less to be near what I would call fair, i.e, to have a legacy admissions rate much closer to the typical admissions rate (obviously yes legacies are going to have better credentials, but we can control for all of this and the gap left over is still huge). You're arguing it's more likely they're multiple times less legacy preferring to Harvard, which honestly sounds like the more unreasonable extrapolation.",

If it was easier to get accepted as a non-legacy, then no one would claim to be a legacy student on their application. That\u2019s not even close to true because [about 25%](https://www.ivycoach.com/the-ivy-coach-blog/ivy-league/role-legacy-admission-upenn/) of Penn students are legacy. Not only that, but I can almost guarantee (though this information is not available, perhaps for a reason) that less than 25% of students who apply to Penn are legacy. Therefore, the legacy acceptance rate is almost certainly higher than the non-legacy acceptance rate, in addition to the fact that legacy students claim their legacy status on application.",

My kid is a straight A student with tons of AP classes, coauthored scientific publications with top professors.  Team Captain, 99% SAT, lots of activities and academic competition awards, recs from top professors\u2026 Deferred from Penn ED then rejected. He\u2019s headed for a comparable school instead.  \n\nNONE of the kids I\u2019ve interviewed who got into Penn over the last few years have been a legacy.  My old classmates have similar stories.  Most people commenting here have no recent personal info and just write from outdated impressions or info about other schools",

If anything many have been outstanding and excellent students. Maybe it\u2019s just the sample I have come across. Yes there has statistically been more legacies getting accepted but that also doesn\u2019t mean they are less or not qualified or credentialed.",

    "postText": "The course looks fairly new offered for the first time last semester by Prof. Dana\u00eb Metaxa. Reading about the description of the course, I'm guessing it would be something about UI UX, but I wanted to know more about it before signing up.\n\nCan anyone who took the class last sem tell me a bit about this course? Any input on things like the course material, assignments, projects, difficulty, workload, whether you found it helpful or not, would greatly be appreciated!",

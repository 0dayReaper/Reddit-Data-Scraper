Thank you!\n\nI applied for both EE and CIS master, but I only got into EE, so I'm considering to enroll as EE and transfer to CIS. Does anyone know how difficult is this transfer? Or should I just choose a CS program at another school?\n\nI also saw that a A- or higher grade of CIS 502 or 511 is required. Does anyone know the difficulty and workload of these two courses? Is it possible to get a A- or A?\n\nI appreciate any comment and information!! This info is really important for me. Thank you!",

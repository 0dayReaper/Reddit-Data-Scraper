Should I try and study over the summer and place out of language? If I can't, does anyone here know how French classes are structured? Thanks!",

I am a rising sophomore, and I would say it honestly depends on what you want to do and also how hard your major is and if you want a GPA boost. \n\nI am a dual-degree candidate at Penn and I have a lot of hard classes and honestly starting at French I and not testing out was a good decision for me because the class took little to no time at all and was a GPA boost for my first semester at Penn. \n\nThe French department at Penn is great. Although you do have French for 4 days a week, 1 hour each which can be annoying, but it was worth it for me at the end of the semester.",

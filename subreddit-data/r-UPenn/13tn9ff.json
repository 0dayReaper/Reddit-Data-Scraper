    "postText": "This is really embarassing, but would anyone be willing to explain how recruiting, career fairs, internships, and things like that work on campus?  For example, what is the timeline, what do you do at a career event, or any relevant information. \n\nI\u2019m a rising junior math major/CS minor. I\u2019m not really gunning for a specific career or anything, but I\u2019m interested in software engineering or data engineering/analytics. \n\nIk this sounds really stupid. As a freshman, I was burnt out from the college application process and how competitive/busy it was, so i chose not to get involved in any clubs or anything that seemed like a rat race. I also took a multiple year long leave of absence because I had to financially help my family during covid. Because of these circumstances I\u2019m really out of touch with the career things that go on, and I\u2019m too embarassed to ask anyone I know in real life. I\u2019m fgli, and I don\u2019t have any family members to help out with this stuff.\n\n\nIf anyone ends up replying, thank you, i appreciate it a lot!",

This stuff isn\u2019t explicitly taught at university and is largely self-taught or through mentorship. \n\nTimelines vary by industry - consulting for example recruits very early in the school year, but software engineering roles stay open fairly late into spring. Since you know you\u2019re interested in software engineering and data analytics, that\u2019s good, you can try to look into various roles in these areas and understand what they entail and evaluate how you might like them (eg a data engineer role differs from a data scientist role which differs from a cloud engineer role, so google is your friend here). \n\nOnce you have an idea of what role(s) interest you, talk to people *at* those roles (connect through linkedin or talk to older students) on what kind of skills are needed to get those roles. Simultaneously you can find specific roles at companies you consider a good fit and talk to career services about how you can best apply to those roles - and APPLY. None of this means anything unless you apply! Simultaneously, put in the work to polish your interview skills in accordance with what you learned from talking to people *at* those roles. \n\nI won\u2019t comment on career fairs cuz I\u2019m a master\u2019s student and I\u2019m not sure of all the opportunities you have available as an undergrad, but I\u2019m sure someone in your major eyeing similar roles who has gone through the process can help you.\n\nAlso note, don\u2019t be discouraged by rejections. It\u2019s easier said than done, but it genuinely is a numbers game, and I\u2019ve gotten rejections from far \u201cworse\u201d options than my upcoming job. Rejections in tech are pretty much expected by everyone, and even people with years of experience are getting laid off. The market isn\u2019t promising right now for anybody, so please don\u2019t take it personally.",

            "comment": "pls don't be embarrassed!!\n\nif you want to get into software engineering, then you should be aiming to get an internship next summer. Applications start up in july/august and will continue to trickle in until late april/early may. As someone with little prior experience, you'll want to start early. For this summer, I think the best thing you could do is a) learn leetcode (follow [this list](https://neetcode.io/practice)) b) polish up your resume, and c) build a webapp or some other nontrivial cs project that you can put on your resume and talk about. \n\nthe main avenue to apply is through online applications. Last year, there was a list maintained [here](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2023-Internships). The list for this year is [here](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2023-Internships/blob/dev/README-2024.md). You'll also be able to find opportunities on linkedin &amp; handshake. Generally, employers don't give a shit about cover letters. \n\nif you'd like, feel free to send over your resume sometime in the future if you want me to take a look over it. i am also a rising junior but i got 7-8 offers this cycle for swe/ds.",

Even try calling them this week to set up an appointment ASAP or go onto Handshake! They can tell you what your options are regarding networking, recruiting/OCR, etc. Phone number is (215) 898-7531.\n\nAlso, student orgs are great for this sorta stuff. If you're interested in data science, try looking into the [Penn Data Science Group](https://penndsg.com/)!

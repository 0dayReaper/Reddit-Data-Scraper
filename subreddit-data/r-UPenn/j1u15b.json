    "postText": "hello,\n\nit is not my intention to \"expose\" you or identify you in any way. I do NOT want to start any sort of witch hunt just to be clear which is why I am remembering details for you to recognize only. I simply cannot bring myself to directly confront you but I hope somehow this message reaches you.you met me in march. I was in the neighborhood gym right before the beginning of the coronavirus. You hit on me there and got my Snapchat.  I ended up at your house a couple of nights later. We talked for a while and began hooking up. I explicitly told you I did not want to have sex. You ended up finishing in your pants from dry humping and awkwardly dropped me off at home. You didn't contact me for months which I expected and was honestly relieved by because the end of the encounter was extremely weird.\n\nin july, you actually began snapping me and I blatantly said you were too much of a \"player\" for me whereas I liked to date. I feel this detail is worth throwing in because I think I did convey in some desperate notion that I wanted a boyfriend and I was cognizant of the fact that you seemingly wanted to hookup. More importantly, you were cognizant of the fact I did not just want to hook up.\n\nafter we both tested negative, I came to your house around 7pm. you introduced me as a friend to your mom before we went to your room. We spoke breifly and began hooking up. I once again immediately and explicitly said I did not want to have sex. you took off my top and shorts as well as yours and I felt comfortable. You began to take off my underwear and I started to feel weird. I began to tell you I was on my period and you quickly put yourself inside of me without a condom while you were on top of me. I explicitly told you I did not want to have sex. I said, \"I don't want to have sex.\"\n\nwhen you penetrated me, I felt frozen. there was blood on your sheets and dick. you expressed some desire to sleep with me again and I responded affirmatively yet coldly because I wanted the encounter to be over and I don't think I could wrap my mind around what had happened.  I still can't. I walked home. Fortunately, I do not attend Upenn.\n\nI just want to know, how could you do that to me? I will be fine. I am sure I will fall in love and have normal sexual relationships and find happiness with someone I trust. But really... what the fuck? Everything about you disgusts me. I subtely detected your narcississm from your obsession with brand name clothes to your endless requests for verbal praise yet I wrote off these qualities as sexy arrogance as opposed to legitamate red flags and an indication at a larger lack of empathy. I will be fine but I can't ever articulate the profound ways this night disturbed me and shaped the way I view love and sex.\n\nI bet one day you will have a nice house with a nice wife and cute kids. A nice job and all the bells and whistles and an ivy league degree in tow. I always think you will be an insecure parasite.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nenjoy your pathetic life,\n\nanon",

                    "comment": "I honestly do not intend to. the reason being:\n\n1. It does not seem worth the trauma given the fact I lack any physical evidence of the event. I would endure the pain of the legal system if it meant I could actively prevent another woman's pain. However, because I have no evidence and so much time has passed even a rape kit would be negligible, I don't think it would be worth it. The only evidence I have against this person is merely my word. \n2. I'm genuinely scared of him and his family. I truly never want to see this person's face again and the wealth of the family is intimidating. The idea that they may investigate me to portray me as a whore is scary. I highly doubt they would simply allow the accusation to made without challenging me and defending their son. This person is popular and well-liked on campus.  The social repercussions also haunt me and I also don't want people to know what happened to me. That may seem ironic considering I literally posted the story on the internet but the idea of everyone in my life knowing me to be a rape victim (or likely just a rape accuser to a considerable amount of people) is not what I want. \n3. Law enforcement makes me feel uncomfortable and the thought of having to respond to cross-examination and spend months talking to officers is intimidating.  \n4. This post was my closure. I just want to pretend like this never happened now. \n\nI know this seems incredibly selfish and many of you will judge me negatively for this decision. I'm sorry.",

I just wanted to say in response to your last line, you are not selfish. You are not at fault, the person who assaulted you is, and not wanting to go to the police does not make you selfish, it just reflects our fucked up legal system. Please do reach out to any resources you feel can help you, but you are not selfish and this is not your fault in any way.",

            "comment": "hi,\n\nI've gone through something similar to the first part of your story. I was assaulted by a stranger but was lucky enough to get away before penetration could happen. Although it's only a one-time event, I was bothered by it for years (would cry for hours when I heard the word \"sex\"). I was friend with the harasser on social media so I would stalk him(hoping to see him get stumped to death by an elephant or something like that), which only made my anger grow. Last summer I finally recognized I was wasting too much of my emotion/time/energy on this shitty memory so I went to see a counselor. I was diagnosed for PTSD and did a treatment called EMDR and I'm ok with this unpleasant experience now(I still recognize that it has harmed me but it no longer triggers my emotion). \n\nI agree that it's hard to seak legal help/find ways to have the guy \"punished\", but if you feel like you're bothered by what this guy did in any way, talk to a counselor about it. I think the best way to minimize your loss would be to stop spending time or emotion on this guy asap.",

But I have noticed during my time here that there are unfortunately a lot of students who act like the typical elitist and egotistical douchebag. A lot of Wolf of Wall Street types, but I guess there are even some American Psychos mixed in there as your story shows. Again, I wish you the best OP.",

If you want, my DMs are open, and I can help you get in contact with Penn resources regarding assault (I think they apply to you even if you don't attend this school). Or if you feel comfortable there are ways to get the help you need at your school probably. These resources are available even if you do not intend on pressing charges. You deserve to live without this on your conscience, and you need to do whatever you need to do to get to that clarity. The audacity of some men at this school is astounding.",

OP said that this person is wealthy, so it makes a lot of sense that she hasn't gone to the police. Trying to come forwards could lead to even more trauma for her.",

But I found my people in roughly March of my freshman year and the rest was history!\n\nI had a fantastic academic experience. I was able to take a lot of seminars in PSCI, which is what I studied, and my friends and peers were just so brilliant. I grew a ton intellectually and feel like I really came into my potential at Penn.\n\nI also miss Philadelphia. It was a great place to go to school; awesome restaurant and bar scene, West Philly is a fun neighborhood, lots of opportunities for summer internships because you're already right there in the city.",

I'm sure this has been asked multiple times, but is UPenn's competitiveness truly so cutthroat, or is that something that's more inherent in Wharton and less so in the other schools? Thank you!",

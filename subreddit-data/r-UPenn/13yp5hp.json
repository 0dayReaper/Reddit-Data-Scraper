    "postText": "I'm considering applying to the Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science (MSE-DS Online) at UPenn and was hoping to hear some personal experiences.\n \nTo those who have been accepted into or graduated from the program, I'd love to hear about your experiences. What are some pros and cons that you encountered during your time in the program? How were the faculty, course materials, networking opportunities, etc.? Did the program meet your expectations or exceed them?\n \nOn a related note, could you also share a bit about your applicant profile at the time of your application? What were your GPAs, test scores, work experiences, or other relevant statistics? Any tips for strengthening an application would be greatly appreciated too.\n \nI understand everyone's experiences are unique and different, but hearing from you will definitely provide valuable perspectives and help me make an informed decision. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you're comfortable with.\n \nThanks in advance for your time and insights. I look forward to hearing from you all!\n \nBest",

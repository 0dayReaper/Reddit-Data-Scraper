    "postText": "I was wondering if there are any students that transferred to UPenn from another university that would be willing to let me ask them some questions? I specifically would like to talk to anyone who did *not* transfer from a community college, and preferably anyone who transferred to Wharton. I just want to ask about what students did in high school and early college to be accepted, though I do not wish to pry for any information that a student may not be allowed to/want to give.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not trying to be a Debbie downer but you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find transfer students on this sub who transferred directly into Wharton who were not internal transfers (which are already rare). I myself was a transfer into CAS. As for advice I can give, most of the time transfers are students who could have gotten in straight out of high school. There isn\u2019t any special advantage or different criteria for transfers and frankly you can\u2019t change much in a year. The reality is none of us can look into your mind/personal interests and how you wish to expound upon those so the advice I\u2019ll give is pretty cookie cutter. Focus on your grades in high school aim for top 10% of class. Get a good SAT score preferably north of 1500. Take as many AP\u2019s as you can and get 5\u2019s if possible. Academically aim to be your best, I just gave some minimal guidelines. Aim for Valedictorian and a 1600 but it\u2019s not a big deal if those things don\u2019t happen, just strive to be the best you can be. Ensure you\u2019re building out your extracurriculars through leadership in clubs or sports. Make sure you enjoy these as high school is hard as is, you don\u2019t want to be miserable in your extracurriculars. Aim for excellence in whatever avenue you pursue whether that\u2019s a president of a club/ a captain in a sport/ a presidential volunteering award for some philanthropy activity, etc. The reality is at the end of the day it might still not be enough or maybe luck wasn\u2019t on your side but you\u2019ll still end up in a much better position/school than if you didn\u2019t try.",

    "postText": "I transferred from another school as a rising junior last year, and I just wanted to rant on how unorganized/incompetent ISSS at Penn is. **Note: terms highly specific to F-1 students, pure rant.**\n\nTo start off, I plan on graduating May 2024, but ISSS put my program end date as May 2026. I was recently employed on-campus, and both I-9 and FNIS ask for program end date. I was not going to put the incorrect date on there so I contacted ISSS. Maybe it's just my advisor, but any email requires at least 3 business day for any reply of any quality (yes, picking only 1 question out of a long email from me), and she's almost never available for virtual appointments, and the earliest virtual appointments (by any staff) available is in at least a week.\n\nSo naturally, I walked in to ISSS office. The reception was empty and they seemed unprepared for my question. In the end, they referred me to use \"Program extension\" on my iPenn (not to mention the frequency at which iPenn goes down), but this then defers my request to my college advisor, making it look like I actually need more time to graduate rather than fixing an error they made directly through ISSS.\n\nOn top of this, my ISSS advisor just replied: \"please contact your ISSS advisor to change your I-20\".

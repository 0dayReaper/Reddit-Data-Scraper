    "postText": "I'm planning to take 2 classes this summer through my local community college. I submitted the application on the XCAT tool for both these classes and they both got approved, but I just read on the credit away webpage that credit doesnt transfer for 2 year or community college classes. Does the XCAT approval mean I will still get credit even though the policy says I wont?",

Since the community college courses is college rule, sometimes the people reviewing XCAT requests don\u2019t check the your status and will just approve them if there is a precedent. They can\u2019t still rescind the credit even if the department approved it.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am an incoming freshman and I submitted my housing application. I chose gender inclusive housing as part of my housing application. I do not mind if I am with people from my same sex/gender or not. However, my priority is being placed in the housing I prioritized in the ranking. It is very important for me to have my own personal space so I ranked housing with single-rooms in suit style accommodation the highest. However, I am concerned that by choosing gender inclusive housing I will not get assigned the accommodations at the top of my list. I would really appreciate all and any advice! Here is my list from highest to lowest:\n\nLauder, Gregory, Hill, Fisher, Ware, Stouffer, Kings, DuBoise",

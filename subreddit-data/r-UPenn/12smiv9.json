    "postText": "Hey all!!\n\nI recently got accepted (and committed) to Penn and want to visit campus before I officially attend. I was unable to attend quaker day or the admitted student tours and this weekend is the only available time for me to visit. Unfortunately all the tours for this weekend are filled up and I will likely have to pursue a self guided tour. I was wondering if you guys have any advice for places I should visit and tips to get into or avoid certain places (additional context: I am interested in pursuing economics and computer science) \n\nAlso, I was wondering if there is anywhere else to sign up for tours other than the Penn website?\n\nAny insight is appreciated. Thanks in advance!!",

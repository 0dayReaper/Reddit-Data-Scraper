If there's a groupchat for the class, join it. Make sure you have one or two people in every class you'd be able to ask for notes if you need them.\n\nWalking to/from class with people and grabbing lunch before/after is a great low-pressure way to get to know people\n\nLearn to use SEPTA and get a Key card (reloadable transit pass) - going into Center City, Chinatown, Old City (the touristy areas) during the daytime is easy, cheap, and as safe as you're gonna be in a city. You're in the best city in America, in my incredibly biased opinion, get out of the Penn bubble every now and then and enjoy it!",

Those comments are misleading.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure and you\u2019re in Wharton / want to go business: then try to join a consulting or finance related club. If you are sure what you wanna do, try to join that specific club then. Clubs are essentially to put something on your resume and help get a job. So, apply to as many as possible.\n\nIf you want to make friends tho, then join greek life. It\u2019s rare to meet your \u201cmain\u201d group of friends via low-commitment clubs. Frats can be social or pre-professional. Your choice. Exceptions include: if you\u2019re in varsity sports or in a religious group. Cultural clubs have mixed results. I\u2019m not sure about band or theater. But I\u2019m leaning towards slightly better than typical clubs. \n\nAt this point, you\u2019re going to be very busy cause of clubs, etc. De-prioritize easy classes. Focus instead only on the following: concentration / major specific classes, resume-building activities and recruitment. People call it \u201ctime management\u201d but it essentially just means doing a half-assed job for a lot of stuff and going all out on things that might contribute to the above factors. One way of doing this is by gaining access to \u201carchived\u201d classwork, homework, assignments, etc. This can happen through upperclassmen that are in your same club or even program that has been passed down. \n\nFor housing, Quad is for social people. Hill for academic-y people. Kcech is Huntsman program. Lauder is tempting interior-wise but it\u2019s an outcast. (This might be different tho cuz i heard theres construction in Quad). Basically, the more \u201cwell-known\u201d and ugly a dorm is, the more party social it is. The nicer the interior and less known a dorm is, the less \u201cparty\u201d typa social.\n\nInfo-session events whether for clubs or a company, are basically mandatory. It\u2019s a \u201cfilter\u201d for sifting through applicants.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to find an impressive internship summer freshman year.",

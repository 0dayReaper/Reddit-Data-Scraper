    "postText": "Incoming freshman here. Should I take math during the fall/spring? Is there any difference?\n\nMy schedule would be better with math in the spring so I can adjust well into college, but also I am planning on taking Gen Chem 2, NRSC 1110, and a writing course along with 1410 in the Spring... which is a lot? \n\nAny thoughts?",

            "comment": "From a former 1410 TA: it\u2019s typically slightly easier to get a better grade in the spring (the content stays the exact same) - likely because freshmen have a chance to experience Penn for a semester in the fall and are now more used to the workload, TAs gain more experience, fewer students in the spring, and those who take in the fall usually have more math experience. \n\nAccording to students, Ghrist is typically the best prof (he did write the new course tbf) but getting a good TA and going to office hours/study sessions is much more valuable for mastering content so would HIGHLY recommend those.",

He\u2019s also more engaging. Also, math tables are basically little sessions he holds in the Africana building Thursdays at 11am in which he goes over content that might be present on the upcoming Friday quiz, basically it\u2019s a review session. (HIGHLY recommend if you want to pass the class with a good grade)",

Nrsc isnt tht bad, you just wanna make sure to be relatively consistent (its j a lot of memorization) and gen chem will vary depending on ur background coming in, but as long as you understand everything properly you'll be fine",

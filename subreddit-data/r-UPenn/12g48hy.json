    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm a new freshman entering Penn as part of VIPER in Physics and either MSE or CS. I'm in quite a unique situation and have a couple of questions:\n\n1. I attended a boarding school in New England and took calc bc as a freshman. This gave me the opportunity to take multivariable calc, linear, and diffeq through my high school. However, Penn doesn't recognize anything past bc as credited since there are no APs. Would it be advisable for me to start from Calculus II (1410) again or try to finesse my way into Calculus IV (2410)? I'm familiar with almost everything in 1410 and 2400, including a good deal of 3140, but I think I would need to review the material (esp 1410) since I took it 2 years ago.\n2. I also have AP credit for the first two courses in the physics sequence. Would it be advisable to use the credit to skip the introductory physics classes (PHYS 0150, 0151) or retake them in the honors variant (PHYS 0170, 0171)? For context, I've also done a moderate amount of competitive physics, including the USAPhO.\n3. I was in Prof. Rajiv Gandhi's Program in Algorithmic and Combinatorial Thinking (PACT) summer program, which covers the entirety of the CIS 1600 course. Since Rajiv is a lecturer here, I also wonder if I should at least attempt to skip it. I did pretty well in that class, and I think Rajiv would vouch for me if I asked.\n\nSorry for the super long post, and any help would be greatly appreciated!",

He is absolutely incredible, and the best physics Prof you will have in your lifetime.\n\nFor math, I would start taking 314. You might have to email the Prof to get official permission, but it will be a waste of time for you to retake classes if you feel like you mastered the material in the past. Note that PHYS170-171 will also help you remember the important parts of multivariable calc anyways. If you feel a bit shaky with LinAlg even after a bit of review, 240 would be a better choice.\n\nWhen I was doing the calc sequence I heard from many people that math 241 was a pain and semi pointless, and to take the 400-level PDEs course instead. This is what I did and I liked it. The physics dep should accept this as a replacement for the 241 req.",

Tests that let you earn credit for math classes you wish to skip aren't until the start of the semester. \n\nAs for 1410 vs. 1610: My bias is that comfort with proofs is very useful for people in CS.  Be aware that, at least according to the website (https://www.math.upenn.edu/undergraduate/calculus-homepages/mathematics-116), 1410-2400 cover subjects in an order different than 1610-2600.  I'm not sure that this is likely to matter, but it's one of those datum that might be useful at some point.",

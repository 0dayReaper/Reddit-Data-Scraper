    "postText": "I am in the college doing Econ and second major in CS. I have 3 options:\n\nOption 1: CIS 2400, Econ 2100, 3 gen eds -- schedule conflict with cis 2400 and econ 2300, is it bad to delay econ 2300?\n\nOption 2: CIS 2620, Econ 2100, Econ 2300, 2 gen eds -- would have to take cis 240 with farmer in the spring which I heard is much harder\n\nOption 3: CIS 2400, CIS 2620, Econ 2100, 1 gen ed -- too difficult?\n\nMy priority is high gpa, but I do not want to fall behind. I am kinda struggling in cis 121, so I am def not a top CS student who can handle a really heavy courseload. Also, after Rajiv I def want to take classes with the \"easier\" prof lol. Which option is the best?",

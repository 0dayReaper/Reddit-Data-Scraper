    "postText": "Not to complain, but IT really needs to improve the Wi-Fi on campus. I either can't connect to the Wi-Fi or get kicked out and often I need a Wi-Fi adapter to connect. Even then, that doesn't work sometimes. I tried to submit IT support tickets in the past, and they weren't beneficial just telling me that I'd have to find \"a better spot\". This is a problem, since not every spot has good Wi-Fi.",

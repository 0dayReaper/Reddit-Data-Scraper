Do you have any recommendations for chem resources?\n\nAlso, besides courses, GPA, and MCAT, what else is important for premed applications? I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not the same as undergrad requirements lol",

I\u2019m studying for the MCAT right now, and reviewing all the chem stuff from Gen Chem to Orgo to Biochem using MCAT resources also helped give a refresher. Some I\u2019d recommend are Jack Westin, Anki, UWorld, and a supplementary prep book like Kaplan or Princeton Review.",

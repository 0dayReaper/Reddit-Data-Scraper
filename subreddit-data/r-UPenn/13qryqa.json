    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m currently an incoming transfer student, (rising sophomore, Class of 2026) planning to major in either Economics or Political Economy. I plan on pursuing a career in consulting, but I was unfortunately unable to land a consulting related internship this summer. I\u2019ve been LinkedIn stalking (hope this isn\u2019t considered abnormal LOL) and it seems like a good amount of kids at Penn with similar majors as mine have secured freshman year internships/opportunities, whether they be with smaller firms or summer insight/emerging leaders series with companies like Goldman, EY, Bain, etc. Was wondering if there are any of you out there who were ever in similar situations as mine, and how your recruiting the following summers went! I\u2019ve heard lots of mixed opinions from close mentors, but the general consensus seems to be that not having an internship freshman year isn\u2019t necessarily a defining factor in future recruiting seasons. I would love some insight from people who\u2019ve been through this process, it would be super helpful! Also, some advice as to how I could spend my summer in the absence of an internship would be awesome! Thanks so much for all of your help, and I\u2019m so so excited to join the Penn community this fall! Go Quakers!",

People aim for Jane Street, TwoSig, Boutique IBs, Hedge Funds, Private Equity, etc",

You will have plenty more opportunities to gain experience in whatever field you want. You should take a break and rest for a bit this summer. If you\u2019re looking for things to do, I\u2019d recommend learning a language, reading, getting a headstart on consulting prep (casing, behaviorals, etc), traveling around whatever area you\u2019re from (doesn\u2019t have to be anything fancy but just try to get out and connect with nature), exercising, learning how to cook, and just spending time with family. Also, since consulting can be quite stressful, meditation is worth attempting to learn too",

I've had a couple of internships not in the USA and definitely not prestigious. \n\nOne thing I am looking into is delaying graduation by 1 semester, so I have 2 summers to intern and come up to the level of the students who have been in the 4-year uni for the entire duration of the program. \n\nCurious to see what advice everyone has :)",

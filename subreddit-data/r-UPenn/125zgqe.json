    "postText": "I'm a current freshman, and I'm a but uncertain about when to take CIS 1600 (previously 160). I've been thinking about doing a double major in CIS (I'm in the college currently), so I feel like it would not be wise to wait until Spring sophomore year, as then I would have to do all the other CIS classes in 2 years (including 121). On the other hand, I've heard a lot of stories about Rajiv's class, and a 1600 TA I know told me to avoid it at all costs if possible because the difficulty difference between Fall and Spring is not even a comparison. Since I'm also planning on taking 6 classes, with a number of them being fairly difficult as well, (including  Math 2400 and ESE 2100), I'm not sure if this would necessarily be a good idea. Still, the other option would be to take it over the summer, so I don't know if this would necessarily be a much better option, especially since there are no office hours and everything is in 6 weeks. Does anyone have experience with 160 over the summer/an opinion either way?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: the Summer professor is Val Tannen, the same professor who taught the class this Spring",

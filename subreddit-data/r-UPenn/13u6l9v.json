One in particular that I was interested in is the [Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship](https://www.collegehouses.upenn.edu/life/programs/listing#residential_program_listing-block_9-23) program, but I am not able to find much information regarding it. I was wondering if anyone could provide any insight.\n\nThanks again in advance!!",

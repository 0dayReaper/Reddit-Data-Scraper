    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI missed the opportunity to apply to the NHCM program as a high school senior (didn't know 0.0) I saw that there is an opportunity to apply for the program at the end of my first year at Penn. \n\nMy question is: is this a competitive program to be in? How many spots would you guys guess would be open to first year penn students. How has the program shaped some of your undergrad thus far? \n\nthank you!",

We did all get to meet Biden only a few weeks before he declared his presidential campaign though. But that\u2019s because his staff thought we all wanted to run for office.\n\nI will say, it was a good community because of the people. You get pretty close your freshman year (even though you drift apart from most of the group throughout the next three years). Also, it\u2019s in the Quad which is cool.",

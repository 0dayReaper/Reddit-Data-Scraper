    "postText": "I\u2019m still looking for a 1 bedroom apartment off-campus for next year. HamCo seems like exactly what I want in terms of price, quality, and location. But many people say that the management completely sucks and leaves nearly every issue unsolved. I am unsure of what to do because I have not found another option close enough to campus in a location I like.\n\nI\u2019d love anyone\u2019s thoughts on where to look for housing, problems or good experiences with HamCo",

            "comment": "Hey! I don't know much about HamCo, but just be careful if you do move there, especially with what happened on Tuesday. It can happen anywhere around that area, but the point is that it happened there, and there are definitely not-great people always on the prowl for easy victims. Do check in with residents if you can, and see what they say! Of course, it doesn't happen there so often, but it's always good to not neglect details like these, and of course, not to go out at night (especially not after midnight, which is when the victim was just taking out the trash). My hope is that they'll take this seriously and up security permanently, not just for a few days, because paying residents deserve that.\n\nGood luck!",

Overall, my experience was fine. It definitely is a convenient location and the quality is decent enough. It may even be better now, since I lived there while there was still a lot of construction happening for all the new amenities and restaurants. I'd say if you don't have any better options, HamCo is fine as long as you don't have very high expectations and can tolerate any mishaps that may arise.",

People were left homeless because of water damage with zero rent compensation, maintenance is completely unresponsive, and the manager routinely gaslights the residents into thinking the problem is solved (had a broken shower the entire semester and everytime they tried to convince me it was working). Avoid if you can",

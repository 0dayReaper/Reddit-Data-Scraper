            "comment": "I am not meche, but I have had pretty great experiences with grad school at penn engineering. Coming from a state school for my undergrad, I definitely feel a large difference in environment and academic rigor. I had to adjust quickly to keep up which was hard but rewarding in my opinion. I also have never had so many good professors. I can't complain about a single one I've had so far. They are amazing at teaching, always willing to help you out, and easy to approach and connect with. I have heard mostly good things also from peers who have had different courses and professors than I.\n\nDo note, I am not sure if this is an ivy vs non ivy thing or undergrad vs grad school thing. Undergrad to Grad is a transition in itself that will probably cause these same points I bring up at other schools too, perhaps it is just emphasized here.\n\nIn the end a Penn masters degree will probably stand out more than a state school, but I am sure both will take you far.  Also from what I know, Penn State in particular has a pretty good engineering program. Its best to go with a program that you feel fits you. In the end you'll have a masters degree in engineering and that's valuable in itself.",

Some people found it challenging though. I learned so much and it was honestly my favorite class. Devlin is the goat. I also highly recommend sociology 1000 (cultural diversity). I am taking it this semester. The lectures are interesting and the workload is very light. The recitations are annoying though, but it\u2019s a good gpa booster.",

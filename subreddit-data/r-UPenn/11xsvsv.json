    "postText": "Fels Institute admitted student here for a MPA graduate program. I have a few questions, can people help me out? \n\n\\- does upenn have a strong sense of community and are there lots of parties where you can meet people outside of your school? \n\n\\- does Fels Institute for government have a strong standing in the uni? or is it another one of those places where its overshadowed by Wharton? \n\n\\- how is the intercollegiate football excitement?   \n\\- can MPA students join clubs across campus, especially clubs that have the Wharton label (eg. Wharton Investment &amp; Trading Group (WITG))?",

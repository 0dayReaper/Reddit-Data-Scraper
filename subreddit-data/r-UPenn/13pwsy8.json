    "postText": "I'm currently a UG at a public university that doesn't offer a degree in neuroscience and came across Penn LPS's neuroscience certification. I talked to an enrollment coach and she said that I'd be able to take the courses alongside my regular semester's courseload at my current school. I don't see any major difference between UPenn and Penn LPS in the material that is taught and the professors that teach, however, LPS seems to be looked down upon. I was just wondering if pursuing this certificate was a good idea and if the certificate/courses are worth it as the tuition is rather expensive and also if taking these classes would be acceptable/look good on my med school applications.",

            "comment": "I would say go for it if you are really interested in the neuroscience courses and want to learn them to learn them. Brand name wise, it is true that Penn LPS is not the same as Penn, but I can\u2019t see how getting this certificate could be seen as anything but positive if the price isn\u2019t that bad.",

            "comment": "I think part of it is just that LPS is designed for nontraditional students and doesn't have the same admissions requirements as Penn, so reputation wise some people (and students here) aren't huge fans. But I did the LPS advanced certificate in neuroscience before starting an MSE at SEAS and I really liked the program. Material wise it's the same as the College version of the classes aside from different tests and sometimes different assignments. If it'd be a major financial hardship I wouldn't do the program but if you really like neuroscience and can afford it, it's not a bad program",

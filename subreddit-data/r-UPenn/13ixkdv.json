Transfers can def double major within their own school, you might just have to do an extra semester or year. You can look at the major requirements and map it out.",

My experience was that you can become as integrated as you want, but you always have the transfer community to lean on. Probably 1/2 my friends at Penn are transfers. A fair amount of leadership roles on campus are occupied by transfers too!",

It's been a few years since I graduated so I won't comment on how students across schools view each other, but Penn engineering acceptance rate was lower than Wharton's around 2018 or 2019 (and might still be). If you're trying to figure out which school to pick, let me repost one of my older comments:\n\n&gt; Undergraduate CS curriculums in the US are quite similar across all elite universities, from MIT and Stanford to Penn and Yale. You'll get a great education at any of them - instead look at their culture to see if they're a good fit.\n\n&gt; Penn is a heavily pre-professional school thanks to Wharton. If you're majoring in CS since you want to go into industry, you'll feel right at home. If you want to go into academia, you'll receive a lot of (implicit) peer pressure to go into industry since most people around you will be interviewing for internships and talking about working at big tech or hedge funds. Somewhere like Caltech would be more research heavy compared to at Penn. I'm oversimplifying Penn's culture here but I hope it gets the point across. Don't think about the CS major itself, think about how the campus culture will impact it.",

Rather, ask what happens when an SEAS student takes a  Wharton class vs. the reverse (or how the two populations view shared math classes).\n\nI will write that it did seem like Wharton had more money to spend on facilities.  This was true years ago, and - based upon recent visits - seems to be true even today.  I admit that I've not actually peeked at budgets, though, so this is just my impression.\n\nSecond: there are small but important differences between CS programs.   I recently asked here about software engineering, and there doesn't seem much more now than when I was studying CSE at Penn.  In contrast, see for example Stanford's CS295.\n\nP.S. I'd love to be wrong about point #2.",

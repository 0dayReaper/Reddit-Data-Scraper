    "postText": "Hi all, apologies for the repetition of posts like this, but I could really use some extra insight! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student looking to move in July to Philly. I'm looking for a 1-2 bed cat-friendly place to share with my partner in the \\~2-2.5k range. We're having a lot of trouble deciding between living in West Philly, the Filter Square/Graduate Hospital area, or the Fairmount area. I was hoping to get some advice since I'm from CA and won't be able to make it out to visit beforehand. I'd like to be able to walk or bike to campus and feel safe as a female if I have a later night coming back. Prefer to be away from the undergrad party scene but would like to be near good restaurants, bars, farmer's markets, cultural events, etc. My partner will be looking for tech jobs, but since we don't know where that will be yet good public transit access would be a plus. We will also have one car and so reasonable parking options are important as well. If you have any pros/cons of these neighborhoods for our lifestyle that would be very helpful, TIA and excited to be a part of Penn! :)",

            "comment": "Would highly recommend Fitler Square, followed by Grad Hospital. Safest (and short) walk &amp; bike to/from campus of the neighborhoods you listed, and a quiet non-undergrad part of the city. Close to the restaurants &amp; bars of Rittenhouse or South St. Your budget will get you a unit in a rowhome that won't have pet restrictions; 2-bed may be near top end.\n\nFor parking: $35/year gets you a permit pass to street park your car with unlimited hours. Finding a spot can be annoying if you're coming back late on weeknight, but otherwise you will consistently get a spot in the neighborhood with a few circles. As long you're not using your car everyday, you can't beat the price and ease. Don't street park your BMW and leave a computer in the backseat, but the neighborhood is safe enough for it. Street parking will be harder the closer you live to Rittenhouse, better as you go farther west into Fitler or south toward Grad Hospital.\n\nOnly hit would be on public transit access for your partner if their job is outside of Center City. But lots of bus routes cross through, and still a short walk to 30th St or BSL.",

I had similar requirements and budget coming in (I pay $2100 total for 3/1 with my partner and two cats and a car). Where I am specifically Is a bit more west and is not the best but not the worst in terms of safety.\n\nWest Philly, especially around the Baltimore area (40-45) is nice. I will usually walk around that area during the week just to chill. Plenty of free parking (ive tried to park arpund rittenhouse, grad hospital, etc. And its always a hassle in my experience.. its doable with patience and planning), weekend farmers markets, food and Cafe options, etc. It's not as busy and dense with food options like center city, but you get neighborhood feels with a quick walk/bike ride to campus. \n\nThere are busses, subways and trolleys out here (for bus, I usually take either the 21 on Walnut or 42 on Spruce).\n\nIf you like city living and don't mind a smaller space for the price, center city is best. If you want a bit more space, a bit calmer vibes and not worry about parking, West Philly.",

So walkable and bikeable around Philly and to/from Penn. 10 minute walk to Rittenhouse Square. Just a great area.\n\nAlso, I graduated from CAMB and the DSRB program, so I\u2019m happy to chat more about the program with you (saw from your other comments that you seem to be enrolled in DSRB).",

My wife and I are also Penn grad students and will be sadly moving out of our apartment since we bought a house. We live in Northern Liberties/Fishtown and although its not as easy to bike to campus I would definitely say its one of the best areas Ive lived in in Philly in my 6 years living in the city.\n\nWe love the food scene in our area as well as cocktail bars and we have always felt safe walking around at any time. We have also really been able to take advantage of our proximity to headhouse farmers market (one of the best farmers markets in philly) and the amazing and cheap food in Chinatown. Hope this helps and let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nAlso my wife and I are looking for someone to take over our 2 br apartment lease (1600 a month) so if that interests you at all as well feel free to send me a message.",

Probably lower on the totem pole for restaurants/ambiance, but there are some beautiful historic homes and some new housing going up as well as you and your family being in the Mecca of the universities of Philadelphia, so all around good vibes\n* Filter Square - a bit more prestigious, more young family/professional oriented, love some of the leafy blocks and great neighborhood-y restaurants. I'd probably move there now of the three, since you can get some space, it's somewhat quieter and good amenities all around. Very safe\n* Fishtown - as you probably know, this is and has been the hip spot of Philadelphia for quite a while now (moving on from NoLib), very safe, too, with a younger crowd but some young families, too. By far the best restaurants, great apartments, super cool people, least convenient for getting to Penn",

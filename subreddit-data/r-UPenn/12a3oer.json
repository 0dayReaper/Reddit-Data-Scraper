    "postText": "As seen in title I\u2019m deciding between Stanford and Wharton except I have no clue what I want to do. I initially applied to Wharton under the impression I would do finance but after informing myself a bit more I\u2019d prefer to not do so unless it involves a couple years of finance and a switch to something better after I\u2019m financially stable.\n\nThat said, I could do end up doing anything from law, public policy, to finance to engineering to public health, maybe pre-med?\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m from the east coast and would know basically no one at Stanford. I have some friends at and around Penn and a great friend that also got into Penn this year.\n\nPenn:\nThe biggest 2 things going for Penn is the location (I\u2019d marginally prefer a city and more outreach opportunities is a big plus)\nAlso the great friend I have going to Penn would make adjustment easier.\nI\u2019m concerned about student body of wharton students \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. I\u2019m a male but i\u2019m not a \u201cdude\u201d. I actually enjoy learning and don\u2019t prioritize salary. I\u2019m at best a socialist, read theory and see humanity in women\ud83d\ude2d. I also lowkey want to take classes from David Eng. I also don\u2019t want to be funneled into IB but I can probably just make CAS friends. If I were to transfer to CAS I feel like then I should\u2019ve gone to stanford lol.\n\nStanford\nIt\u2019s literally Stanford. Way more freedom in doing things. Probably better student-life. Probably better student body for me as well. I\u2019m concerned about the Stanford bubble and the number of community outreach opportunities. Also if I don\u2019t do STEM will I be left out (might do stem but probably not big tech). The biggest issue is that it\u2019s very far and I\u2019d have to leave this friend of mine lol.\n\n(Both will be full-pay)\n\nAlso Brown and Duke are small considerations for me.\nPlz don\u2019t just say ignore your friend when choosing college. I know rationally I should but we are really close and I\u2019m irrational.",

I understand Penn has a diverse range of people but the density of people I\u2019d vibe with is important to me. Also it\u2019d only make sense that most of those in wharton would want to pursue IB and managerial consulting. Most people interested in this career path are interested because of salary. Those are not my ideal people. \nI do appreciate the feedback. My concern is mainly whether wharton will funnel students into IB and whether students are open minded and excited to talk about issues of social justice (and pursue their solutions) or not",

Yes, many ppl do IB and consulting but you can very easily make friends and find circles that aren't full of preprofessional hardos. \n\nStanford is amazing too! I think you should keep talking to people, visit the campuses if you can, and just go with your gut! No wrong choices here. Congratulations on great acceptances!!",

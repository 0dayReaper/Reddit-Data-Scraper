I made the same mistake and ended up wasting time with a bunch of people I def didn\u2019t vibe with when I got here. Check out the pre orientation programs, specifically PennQuest. \n\nTbh the friends u make before classes start and even in first semester will likely not be the friends u will have down the road.",

            "comment": "When  you go to [Upenn.edu](https://Upenn.edu), then go to College of Arts and Sciences and then go to the list of Majors and then go to the Major Requirements for that Major.  I will give you the first one here:  https://neuroscience.sas.upenn.edu/studying-neuroscience/requirements/bbb-major-requirements.   You can do that for all 3.   As a pre-med student, neuroscience will probably give you the greatest ability to develop interests outside of pure cellular and molecular science.  For example, courses in cognitive science and psychology are likely to fulfill more major requirements in the Neuro than in bio-chem, but I could be mistaken you need to go through it.  My recent family grad ended up pre-med with a major in neuro, minor in chem and minor in cogsci and a fair number of language courses.   Good Luck at PENN!!!!!!",

            "comment": "I also recommend looking up the course requirements of the three majors. Theyre in different departments (ex. Biochem is in the chem dept) so their classes will cover pretty different material. If youre premed id recommend taking what interests you - are you more curious about the molecular underpinnings? The larger view of organisms as a whole? Focusing more on the nervous system and its psychiatric manifestations?  Biology (and neuroscience to an extent i believe?) also allow you to focus more on a particular area in the major if you want.",

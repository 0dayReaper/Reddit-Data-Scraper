The requirement is the temperature has to reach a certain threshold several days in a row. Except every year the weather in Philly is becoming more volitile. So you end up with a couple hot days and then one cool one.\n\nBtw, the same goes for turning on the heating. We used to use a hot plate to heat the room up.",

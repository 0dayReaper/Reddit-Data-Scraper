    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman at UMD and looking to transfer. Main reason I want to transfer is because I cant afford UMD all 4 years since I am OOS and I didn't receive good aid at all, and Penn is still my top choice. Any advice for transferring to Penn CAS or Engineering like extracurricular and essays for example? Any transfers here that can advise how to prepare in first year of college would be extremely helpful!!",

            "comment": "It's definitely possible. I transferred in from a worse school into engineering definitely worse than UMD. What worked for me was getting  straight A's in my stem classes and near to that in my gen eds. I joined 2 engineering specific clubs but I wasn't even that involved. In your essays DO NOT COMPLAIN too much. It's a tricky line to toe but yeah. \n\nBut also dude don't be thinking about transferring before you even step on campus. UMD is a great place and you should definitely give it a chance. UMD engineering is also pretty fantastic so you'd honestly be transferring to a pretty comparable school. UMD seems like a fun school just do well in school ur first semester and have fun and if you're hating it after ur first semester then consider transferring. Apps usually aren't due until March ish.",

At the same time, I've met a Rutgers transfer here, and UMD and Rutgers are similar schools in many ways (tho I assume UMD is more selective). This is not advice but I think you should broaden your top choices beyond Penn and include larger schools Cornell Michigan or Georgia Tech which also have excellent STEM programs like Penn.",

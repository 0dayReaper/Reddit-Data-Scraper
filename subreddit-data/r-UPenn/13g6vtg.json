    "postText": "Took CIS 121 and I absolutely hated every moment of my time there. I have consistently been getting 2 standard deviation below the median on exams, and the homework took everything out of me to do but still underperformed. At this point, I don't know what to do to and I'm dreading to retake it. Can anyone give me advice to just PASS the class?",

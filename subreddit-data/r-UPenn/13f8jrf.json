Not sure about Gehrman since I didn\u2019t have him, although it seems like many people have had positive experiences with him. I would say both professors would still do a good job giving you the material needed for the MCAT.\n\nIf you\u2019re studying for the psych/soc section, you need to make a master list/flash cards of all the terms and be able to provide at least one example of each. For example, what is an example of a procedural memory? If I give you an example of classical conditioning, can you tell me what is the unconditioned stimulus/response and the conditioned stimulus/response? Things like that will be tested on the MCAT.",

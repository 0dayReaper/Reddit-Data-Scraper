    "postText": "Had quite a few people recently say stupid shit when Ive communicated that Im not feeling mentally well.\n\n\"Everything happens for a reason\"\n\"Aren't we all [working through some tough stuff]\"\n\"I chose to see it like [rainbows and butterflies]\"\n\nYes, being at Penn is tough and causes us all a certain amount of suffering. Yes, some people make a big deal out of little.\n\nBut for the love of those who are suffering from depresssion or other debilitating issues, please respond with empathy. It deeply hurts when people repeatedly diminish your feelings. You never know the burdens or inner worlds your classmates, professors, etc. carry outside of the roles you see them in at school.\n\nHere are some choices I like better:\n\n\"That sucks\"\n\"Woah, I'm sorry to hear that happend to you/ you're feeling ..\"\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"Why do you feel that way?\"\n\nYou can still maintain boundaries and keep conversations short. I know its uncomfortable, but positive words are toxic positivety because it is toxic to the other person.\n\nWe are Penn. We can create a community of care at Penn. Besides, we remember the best people in our lives not because of what they did but how they made us feel",

It's more important that your clinician knows how you are feeling and if you only see him/her once a week (like most folks), then drastically limit who you share with. It might be easier to just have a family member or childhood friend as a listener for the time being. There is 0 correlation between mental health recovery and receiving empathetic statements from peers. In theory, you can recover from depression without having shared your daily emotions with a single soul. In fact, CBT is not about sharing your mood with others at all.",

But a lot of times, their way is clearly not good enough. People often assume the nature of others problems is the same as theirs. They think what helped them will help others. All of this is not true. \n\nIt's not hard to just validate other people's experience and hear them out. That's already plenty helpful!",

This is how empathy and mental health advice are commonly dispensed in South Asian culture in my experience. There are reasons our tea was brewed this way; our ways of coping like this are understandable given the circumstances, but imo it tastes bad and we can spice it up and make it better :)\n\nJust because this is how it works and just because you struggled does not mean it is how things SHOULD be. We can stop cycles of abuse and shame, and make the world just a little bit better for others with minimal effort. This is a call to action.\n\nAlso, I object to your statement you understand me. Your make a wild leap and assume that my depression and the causes of it are similar to your own. To avoid exactly this I have suggested asking \"why do you feel this way?\" Or, if you don't have the emotional capacity a simple \"that seems like it sucks, OP. Hope you feel better soon\".",

I too have struggled with this but recovered well (sorta lol).\n\nNo one's causes of depression are same and that's not the point. You need to understand early that no amount of empathy is actually going to help you recover. And thinking about how others should be considerate is not just futile but paradoxically putting you in the same boat as them. Maybe the people who said something you did not like, themselves are suffering with something. Maybe its so bad they cannot even think that anyone could have it worse so they nonchalantly reply to you like that.\n\nTry to proceed by thinking that everyone you interact with has just been given a cancer diagnosis that morning. If you cannot imagine that some of the kids here lost a parent, grandparent or pet recently but are still happy enough to respond to you, then you don't understand how complex the adult world is. For all you know, you cried or got agitated by what a recent rape survivor said to you.\n\nI remember when the Brett Kavanaugh trials were happening in 2018 and my uncle got berated by all these women and girls in my family for siding with Kavanaugh from a legal perspective. My dad and I were the only ones who knew that he had suffered a decade of sexual abuse by the church. He just cracked open a beer and snickered at their insults; a very brave response imo. And I realized then, no one should ever judge someone based on their looks or demeanor.",

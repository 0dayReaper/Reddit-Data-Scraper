    "postText": "Jesus christ all my classes are full of people coughing, can you stay the fuck home? If you cough more than once every 20 minutes consider yourself sick and don't come to class spraying your germs everywhere! It's disgusting and self-centered behavior. There really is no excuse especially if the class is recorded.\n\nEdit: I have 2 classes where attendance is mandatory and both of my professors explicitly said that being sick is a valid excuse to miss class as long as they're notified so maybe try that? If you're just worried about content, people have been missing class and getting notes from a friend and they've been doing fine even before covid. If you're still confused email your professor/TA or go to OH. It's not the end of the world even if lectures aren't recorded. ",

The instructors literally had all the resources to accommodate sick, injured, and quarantined students this year while still being able to teach live and in person if they wanted to, and the university basically shut them down and endorsed in-person learning only. Like did you learn nothing from the last year and a half??\n\nThis isn't even just a COVID/pandemic issue. You just in general should not be expected to go to school or work when you are sick, for the sake of yourself or others. You are putting a mental and physical stress on you and your classmates by doing this. All you hear from professors and the university is about putting your mental and physical health first, and then when you want to do that you are penalized essentially. \n\nI'm thankful that most of my teachers are trying to be accommodating, offering virtual office hours and recording lectures when possible, but they can only do so much.",

They could be all optional and ungraded, just practice for an exam. This would benefit the students who work hard so they do not need to practice and can focus on other work instead.\n\nI don't think students are lazy in general. However it's just a human tendency that we view things that are due soon as a priority. We tend not to prioritize long term learning, but will focus on a paper due this week. People aren't lazy, they are still working hard, just prioritizing different things.\n\nUnfortunately this hurts students who attend class as well. In the end they have fewer students to discuss the material with and they might be working on a group project with 3 other students who aren't engaged in the course.\n\nEngaging students is an important part of teaching and a responsibility of an instructor.",

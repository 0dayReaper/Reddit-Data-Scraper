    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m an incoming Freshman to Penn and I was wondering which class is better to start with. I am currently taking IB Mathematics Applications and Interpretations HL and there isn\u2019t a lot of Calculus in the course (frankly, we haven\u2019t even finished the Calc units IB put in the course). My teacher told us that if we did do all of them, colleges don\u2019t even view our Calc to be equivalent as that of AP Calc AB - cause it\u2019s not a full year of Calc and you don\u2019t get enough Calc knowledge. Hence why I\u2019m stuck in this situation. I know you take a placement test before scheduling your classes but I was wondering if its a better idea for me to self study Calc on Khan Academy since they do have a free Calc course, prior to me taking my placement test so i don't have to take Math 1300 (Intro to Calc) in the Fall, and jump straight into Math 1400 (Calc I) or just wing it and take the placement test with the knowledge I'll get by the time I'm done with high school and if the results deem it be, ill just take Math 1300 in the fall and Math 1400 in the Spring?",

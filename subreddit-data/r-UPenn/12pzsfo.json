The questions on the exams are ridiculous and you never know what kind of answer their looking for. The professors are nice on their own but they are so tough especially on students who are just taking this class for a gen Ed requirement.",

To echo what other people said, the professors are extremely inflexible with curving and never make it clear what they look for in the short-answer type of questions on exams.\n\nThey're nice people but it's quite obvious that they put in the bare minimum effort to teach this class. I heard a TA said they admitted that they didn't like teaching big class, so they just refused to accommodate students outside of what they outlined in the syllabus.",

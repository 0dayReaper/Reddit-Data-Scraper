I'm not convinced that is a good idea ... life in a field is not at all like taking classes in that field.  Never let classes decide your major!\n\nDouble/triple majors may be fine paths to follow into law or maybe medicine.  But if you want to be credited with knowing something about a specific field someday on the basis of your undergraduate degree, then pick a field, go deep into it, and don't dilute it with other stuff.  Depth in one field is always more fungible than superficial knowledge in multiple fields.\n\nThen, if you decide to do a PhD in something, there are major advantages to focusing while an undergrad rather than doubling or tripling your major: it will be easier to get into a top grad program, you'll have more perspective about what you want to do in the program, and you'll be much more competitive in that program when you get in.  \n\nEverything is competitive in grad school: getting an advisor, getting approval for a thesis, etc.  You'll want to be studying grad-level stuff rather than making up for stuff you should have taken as an undergrad.  For example, math - there's so much math in econ!!!  The best students come to grad school with a lot of math skills, those without have trouble getting respect.  Entering grad school in econ with only the minimum math skills required for PPE will be a major handicap (if you can even get in).",

I think a lot of people view it as cheese because it's really broad on a surface level, and doesn't require as much math as econ, but that doesn't mean someone can't make the most of the classes they take. \n\nHowever, if you're really interested in those things, you might as well major in one and minor in the others - you'll get more out of it.",

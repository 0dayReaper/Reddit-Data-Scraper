    "postText": "I'm an international student from a 3rd world country and I can't access any of the vaccines required for Nursing school. \n\nI have emailed my nursing advisor and the compliance team but they keep directing me to wel-immun@pobox.upenn.edu, who havent responded to multiple emails.\n\nI know for sure I can't submit a filled form by July 1st. Since I'm highly aided, I assumed I could get the vaccines once I'm at Penn using the insurance cover they offer. But not submitting the form by July 1st means I can't register for courses. \n\nHow do I go about this ?",

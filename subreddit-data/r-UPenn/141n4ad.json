Summer's just begun, you have a lot of time to figure it out.\n\nIf you search the subreddit (putting \"site:reddit.com/r/upenn\" before a google search is a lot more powerful than reddit's inbuilt search, btw), you can find threads about housing, course selection, placement tests, etc. Just keep in mind that housing changes basically every year and a lot of the course codes changed for the 22-23 school year and keep an eye on post dates.\n\nA couple generic tips:\n\n* pick at least 1 course that looks fun and/or easy for freshman fall (double check the difficulty ratings on [penncoursereview.com](https://penncoursereview.com))\n* the math diagnostic exam you take online is only a suggestion and no one cares what you score on it - I actually recommend using your notes from high school as reference so you aren't bogged down with trying to remember\n* the course add period doesn't end until a few weeks into the semester, so whatever you pick over the summer can be changed later\n* anything you forget to pack can probably be bought through some combo of Amazon, Target, and CVS",

            "comment": "Just ignore studying for and taking placement exams for first sem tbh. U can bs the math diagnostic if u want it doesn\u2019t count for anything. Placements are offered every semester, there\u2019s no need to pass them or take them during NSO. I was so glad I just used NSO to meet people not worrying about preparing for an exam. \n\nOnly thing I have to do is set up ur Penn key/email/other admin stuff and meet with ur advisor to sign up for classes. That\u2019s it. \n\nIf u completed something incorrectly \n/forgot to do something the people working at Path@Penn r extremely helpful and they will resolve the issue in literally 5 minutes if u call them.\n\nJust pls enjoy second sem senior year. It is the best time of your life. Not to be dramatic but there won\u2019t be another time in your life where u have nothing to do and can just enjoy hanging out with the people you grew up with.\n\nAlso that feeling where everyone seems like they know what they are doing \u2014 welcome to Penn lol. Here\u2019s the reality: nobody actually knows what they r doing.",

If you\u2019re very anxious just get a little bit done every day, but try to spend most of this summer decompressing and enjoying time with your high school friends. Also at the end of the day be excited for college more than anxious, you\u2019re going to be fine",

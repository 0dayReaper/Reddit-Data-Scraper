But in a couple of years \ud83e\udd1e it will have taken about 6 years of not making any major purchases to pay my student loans in a career field where a majority of my peers and bosses went to community or state schools and getting my license from an Ivy League was 1000% unnecessary.",

If you\u2019re a new grad you\u2019re just a new grad. If you\u2019re not, the only thing places care about is your work experience. Even applying to programs it doesn\u2019t make a ton of difference as they\u2019re more concerned with GPA/relevant experience.",

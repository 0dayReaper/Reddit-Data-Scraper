I\u2019m under the impression that Du Bois, Stouffer, and Gregory are really similar but idk. I\u2019d like to have a not completely dead house (not necessarily parties just like i could go out and meet people in our house and social activitties etc).",

Gregory is a lot like du Bois but it has two buildings. Idk how the engagement is there. KCHECH is nice because the house is social typically and having a dining hall in house is really nice. It\u2019s also the closest to most engineering buildings. Stouffer, Gregory, and Du Bois are all pretty far. I\u2019ve heard stouffer is practically a dead house and isn\u2019t social but I\u2019m not close with anyone who has lived there.",

    "postText": "This would be for the sake of finaid. Looking for another person who did not get very generous aid and will not receive much support from their parents. This will grant independent status on the fafsa and css so that parents\u2019 financial situation is out of the picture. If interested, we would need to sign a prenup (this would greatly decrease the cost of divorce). Pls pm if interested.",

There are also tax implications to being married that a prenup does not alter. And keep in mind that creditors can come after you for some types of your spouse's debt. So overall, I would tread very lightly.",

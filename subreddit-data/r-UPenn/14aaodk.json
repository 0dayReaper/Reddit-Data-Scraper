    "postText": "Hey everyone! You might remember that I have been posting city council updates on this sub. I know it's a lot to take in, so I want to help ease access to local Philly politics for all of us. \n\nThe latest Philly City Council Meeting (on 6/8) was released today on YouTube. If you're interested in what happened, you can get the newsletter [sent to your inbox through this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNRmA31Loz25rSn55FCtVZ1KdX5Xk_YDD5qyYH1sfOy8fkVA/viewform).\n\nIf you are not interested in getting each City Council Meeting in your email inbox but would instead look at them through Reddit, [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTbaQdeV5dNTiJYEm7r6Q6Qy95UnsNq_veWuN25mNXr0FicoTqkSie6a4jNtu_oh-vW2ofDfAtHTIMv/pub) is the latest one. \n\nI just want to mention, there are no benefits for me in sharing this, I am simply interested in increasing access to local politics for us. If I can answer any questions, I would be happy to. Thank you all!",

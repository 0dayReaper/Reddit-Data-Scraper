            "comment": "Wait FUCK guys I was joking with my first comment but apparently not only can the virus survive in snow, it THRIVES in lower temps (and can survive in freezing temps)\n\n); this may be a super-spreader event\n\n&gt;A 2010 [study](https://aem.asm.org/content/76/9/2712.full) used two viruses that are related to the COVID-19 virus to look at the effects of temperature and humidity on viral survival. Researchers found that both lower temperatures and lower humidity helped viruses survive longer. In particular, at 4 degrees C, or 40 degrees F, and 20% relative humidity, more than two thirds of the viruses survived for 28 days. On the other end of the spectrum, at 40 degrees C, or 104 degrees F, and 80% humidity, the viruses survived for less than 6 hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This suggests that coronaviruses survive better on surfaces at colder temperatures. It is also [expected](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10676-can-flu-viruses-survive-winter-in-frozen-lakes/) that the virus would survive being frozen.\n\n[https://covid19.nj.gov/faqs/coronavirus-information/about-the-virus/will-the-coronavirus-survive-in-the-refrigerator-or-freezer](https://covid19.nj.gov/faqs/coronavirus-information/about-the-virus/will-the-coronavirus-survive-in-the-refrigerator-or-freezer)\n\nEdit: https://youtu.be/RqRLDaKexe0",

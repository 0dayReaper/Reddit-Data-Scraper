            "comment": "ABSN alum here - I got a great education and I think the core courses (pathophys/pharm) are much more in depth than most schools (my partner went to Jefferson and her courses didn\u2019t go nearly as deep as mine) but tbh I worked with nurses who went to community college programs and other schools in the area and we all ended up in the same place and they\u2019re all brilliant, fantastic nurses. Where you go to nursing school doesn\u2019t really matter at all to work as a nurse. Where Penn really shines is access to resources and academia - I was able to get a few publications during school and worked as a research assistant on projects I\u2019m passionate about. Is it worth the price tag? For me, at the time, I needed *something* to help me turn around a poor academic past to help me meet my future goals. For me, Penn gave me access to leaders in a field I\u2019m passionate about, leadership opportunities, and access to really fantastic academic resources. I was on the older side of my cohort so I got some more grants and scholarships  than my classmates who were still dependents and did not pay full price but I still finished with almost 4x the debt of my first undergrad degree. Most of my classmates parents paid for some or all of their tuition. Would I chose Penn again now that I\u2019m actually working as a nurse? Honestly I don\u2019t think so - I probably would have chosen a state program like Pitt.",

I think the UPenn ABSN is over $100k in tuition. \n\nMy take is that most employers don\u2019t care where you get your RN. \n\nRutgers camden has a program for around 35k - much cheaper! Holy family is probably much cheaper also. \n\nMaybe Penn hospitals want to see a Penn alumni, but if your goal is just to get an RN, there are other local options that will save a big bundle. \n\nDo they have the same resources as Penn? Probably not, but it is up to you to determine if it is worth the price difference.",

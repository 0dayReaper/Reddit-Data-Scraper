    "postText": "I attended Quaker days today and can say I enjoyed it. However, I know these events for admitted students are typically intended at showing students the positive aspects of the college. While it was clear that the penn community was vibrant and pretty diverse, I wanted a more realistic day to day opinion on the community on campus. Is it as competitive as people say it is? \n\nI\u2019m deciding between UPenn and Duke and I want to get a better sense of how I would fit in on campus.",

The \u201ccool\u201d clinicals like neuro ICU or neonatal ICU at CHOP or whatever filled up within minutes of the list dropping. And clinical sign up time was like 2 weeks of people pulling out their hair hoping for whatever specific thing or trying to meet with the Dean if they didn\u2019t get the one they wanted. Note for students from a nurse who\u2019s worked in 9 different hospitals now: unless you\u2019re trying to get hired at that specific unit, no one after nursing school cares where you did your clinicals. Sorry to the people who were all about it, hopefully takes some pressure off everyone else. \n\nNo: With a couple of outliers, everyone was *very* collaborative. The cohort was the best part of going to Penn. High achievers who wanted everyone else to succeed too. You could always find study groups, practice groups, groups to just decompress and hang out with. We didn\u2019t cut each other\u2019s throats. Just our own sometimes.",

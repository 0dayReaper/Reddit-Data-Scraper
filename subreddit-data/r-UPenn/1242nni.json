How bad would this be? they\u2019re on the same days (M - Th) and 1600 is right after 1200. \n\nThe other option would just to take 1200 this summer and 1600 with rajiv during the fall. \n\nHas anyone done 1200 and 1600 both during the same summer session? if so, honestly, how was it? \n\nAlso, if I do take 1600 with rajiv, any insight on that class? I heard it\u2019s hell :,(",

The course definitely lives up to its infamy as one of the hardest courses at UPenn. But it's also important to know why this is:\n\n* The homework and midterms are oriented towards solving problems. The problems are not straightforward applications of the material you learn. Plus, the thought process behind solving problems is not something that can be easily described with black and white principles.\n* The TAs are extremely nitpicky about grading. If you're using a formula or rule they teach you in the course, **make sure you explicitly cite that formula or rule.** An example of this, is the Multiplication Rule, which you will learn early on. If you're using it in your solution but you don't specifically say \"by the Multiplication Rule,\" you'll lose points.\n* Similar to the point above, if you fail to include certain buzzwords they're looking for, they won't hesitate to take points off. For example, you can only use the Multiplication Rule if \"the steps are independent.\" If you don't say the steps are independent, they'll take points off.\n* The sheer amount of material thrown at you is insane and the pace of the course is unforgivingly fast. If you fall behind, you need to catch up immediately.\n\nThat being said, if you take the course and you're struggling, know that others are probably struggling too. The TAs mean it when they say start the homework early and come to office hours.\n\nBut right now, try to familiarize yourself with the material before tackling 1600. That will save you the possible risk of the material taking too long for you to fully digest as the course moves on to another topic.",

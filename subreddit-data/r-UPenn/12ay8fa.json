            "comment": "207 depends lots on ACCT knowledge, i.e. how familiar you are with the double entries of items of financials. If you are good at ACCT 101 AND taking/have taken classes in 212/242/243, the class is easy, but many students do not... 207 is to remake the financials into investment sense, and then use your Excels to value the companies under different approaches. An excel and financial accounting intensive class. Classes like 251, 253, 402, etc and job interviews build on 207.\n\n203 concerns WHAT financial policies an investor, IB or corporations should pick under different situtations. The policies are based on FNCE 100 tools, so you are assumed to know 100 well. You are given stories/cases and you have to design or critique the policies. There is no black and white answers. However, there is few hands-on modeling. The materials suit the higher level interviews, but I don't know how much will be put in your 1st job.",

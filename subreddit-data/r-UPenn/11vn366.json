    "postText": "Look, I'll be completely honest, they did inform me that 7 taco bell burritos was too much for one man. But if anything that just proved to be words of challenge for me.\n\nBefore the red biopond incident, I grew up in a rural household. Totino's pizza rolls for breakfast, Shrimp maruchan ramen for dinner after I got home. Honestly I thought I had the experience in me. Maybe I went a bit too hard on the crunch wraps that night - i admit it. My last memory is opening 8 diablo hot sauce packets before being pushed in. It was never my intention to completely obliterate the biodiversity within the pond, trust me, my bad for sure.\n\nApparently when MERT arrived I was floating around propelled by my flatulence like some glorified RC motor boat. They had to grab a comically large fishing net to drag me out of the pond. My hot sauce packets had leaked into the water by then so the police suspected I had been driven to my wits and eaten one of the biopond turtles. The insane thing is that they completely ignored Noah Schnapp, my floater-in-arms next to me actively leaking hot sauce, and only fished me out.\n\nSo I guess this is my apology before the truth gets out. There's been rumors about it being a prank or whatnot but sadly it was just my taco bell eating ass falling into the water. Sorry to disappoint.\n\nAs for media please contact my mother she is on the board of trustees. She has firsthand experience in this matter as she pissing herself was the origin of the biopond in the early 1800s. Thank you and AMA!!",

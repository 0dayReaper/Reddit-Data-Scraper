            "comment": "I have enjoyed the BFS program along with the majority of the people that I know in my cohort, but it's definitely not for everyone. I like BFS because it feels like relief from the pre-professional side of Penn. It's more about intellectual exploration for its own sake. If that's not your vibe though, you probably shouldn't do the program. I don't know what the topics are for ISP for 2023-24, but if you don't like the topics I would also not do the program. In my year, it was history and classics the first semester and religious studies and positive psychology the second semester. I'm very much a social sciences/humanities person so I liked that, but I do know a couple STEM people who dropped the program during the drop period because they didn't love the subject matter and having to write essays.\n\nIn terms of the academic requirements, it does eat up half your courses freshman year, but it also fulfills a decent amount of gen eds. I'm double majoring along with being a BFS student, and I'm still able to graduate within 4 years and haven't had to take more than 5 c.u. any semester. The main thing it does take away from you, however, is your ability to take more electives since ISP basically takes up a semester's worth of courses.\n\nSocially, I already wanted to be in Hill so that wasn't a problem for me. I also made a lot of really close friends from the program which I'm grateful for.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to DM me!",

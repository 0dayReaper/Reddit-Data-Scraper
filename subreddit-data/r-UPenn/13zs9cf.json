    "postText": "I\u2019ve scrolled through the subreddit and I\u2019ve seen people recommending different computers for different majors/schools. I\u2019m entering the College and I\u2019m thinking about majoring in neuroscience on the premed track. I\u2019m highly aided, so I get to choose between a MacBook Air M2 or a Dell Latitude 7340. I\u2019m not sure if one computer is better than the other for my major or if I need to use a lot of windows stuff during my time at Penn. Any advice would be appreciated!",

It\u2019s great for downloading lecture slides and annotating/ recording lectures if you use apps like GoodNotes. It\u2019s definitely not required, but I\u2019ve just found it very helpful for stem classes in general, Im also a neuro major + junior",

If I were you, just get whatever's cheaper!\n\nFor pretty much every bit of software you need, there are both Windows and Mac versions. But if you're considering anything engineering-y, I'd go with the MacBook.",

I wanna try out things like animation and 3d design, so that's why I think windows would suit me better (ehem also easier to get cracked softwares haha). Plus, I'm not in the apple ecosystem so I feel like I wouldn't get the full advantages. But apple does have much better battery life meaning you can carry it around everywhere without worrying too much about battery. I'm still unsure too though so lmk what you decide haha",

It seems like you can\u2019t really go wrong with either and I\u2019m sure both will be fine since there\u2019s a mix of students with either type on campus. I\u2019m not trying to do any coding (unless a class asks for it I guess) or anything like that on it, otherwise I might have gotten the dell. Best of luck with your choice!",

    "postText": "Feeling sick to my stomach after the email we all just received. Second undergraduate death within one month, both of them presumably from suicide.\n\nI know this place can feel so overwhelming, sad, and lonely sometimes. Please just know that there are always a million more reasons to stay, no matter what is going on in your life. I\u2019ve been there before, I get it, but try to remember your family, friends, and other loved ones and how much you matter to them. If you don\u2019t have anyone to talk to, please talk to me. I know we all make jokes about how cutthroat this school is sometimes, but the truth is that this is a community and I care deeply about your wellbeing. All of us have our entire lives waiting ahead. Life has only just begun. There will always be a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBe safe, be well, and please put your mental and physical wellness above all else. I\u2019m here for you, and I\u2019m sure there are countless others that are too. We all need a little help sometimes, please don\u2019t be afraid to ask &lt;3",

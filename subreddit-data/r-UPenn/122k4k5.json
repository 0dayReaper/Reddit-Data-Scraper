Chem 1012 goes very deeply into a variety of topics (especially in physical chemistry and inorganic such as ligand field theory). Meanwhile, while chem 1011 may not as deeply as chem 1012, Cirri (who usually teaches this course) usually adds in a few organic chemistry topics that aren't covered in chem 1012. In either course, you definitely learn a shit ton of material, and grow your chemistry intuition (which makes sense... it's supposed to build your chemistry foundations). I personally think Penn does a good job with their introductory gen chem.\n\nRegardless of what course you choose, you **have to put the effort in.** All introductory chem courses are hard. Chem 1011 is hard in its own way and chem 1012 is hard in their ways.\n\nAs regards to professors, I enjoyed all of them. Although the 3 rotation chem professor was a bit eh (for chem 1012), I heard they won't be doing that anymore (I think). Dmochowski is very consistent with lectures, Tomson (while he is serious the majority of the time), like to joke around and very knowledgeable in inorganic, and Cirri is very engaging. I personally like Cirri, especially his explanations, but I know some who really enjoyed Dmochowski. Dmochowski is definitely elite.\n\nI promise, med school doesn't care... please don't be those type of pre-med; just learn and enjoy the course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, quick note, lots of students complain that the course is hard and the test was unfair... I completely disagree. The professors gives a LOT of practice problems / resources (even giving out selected textbook problems to do). Do your readings, redo recitation problems, do textbook problems, and ask questions. Put the effort in, and you'll be fine.",

My thought process was that since both classes are graded on a curve and you need to be in top 30%ish of class to get in A range that it might be easier to get an A in 1011 because less of the students in this class will have a strong Chem background or have taken AP chem\u2026.. do you think this would be the case? I\u2019m willing to put in the work and don\u2019t mind having a high work load, I just want to be sure I\u2019m in a class where I have a chance of getting an A, and I\u2019m worried I will be at too much of a disadvantage in 1012 since I never took AP chem.",

            "comment": "There are several ways you can get clinical hours. One way is through volunteering as an EMT at a local fire company which allows you to gain valuable experience in both treating patients and coordinating with other medical staff. If you\u2019re a freshman or sophomore, you can apply for MERT which does not require an extensive background in emergency medicine or EMS certification so long as you can pass through the interview phase of the application.\n\nOther ways in which you can get clinical hours include being a medical scribe where you help record and document patient EHR information for physicians. There are several medical scribe positions in Philly, although I\u2019m not sure if there are any close to campus. You\u2019d have to talk to some organizations such as ScribeAmerica for that. I\u2019ve also seen some of my friends serve as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) where, as the name suggests, you help nurses deliver patient care with various responsibilities such as patient transport and assisting with medical procedures. \n\nYou also need to make sure that in addition to clinical hours, you have non-clinical community service volunteering such as serving in a food pantry or helping raise money for a charity fundraiser. Medical schools want to see that you are dedicated to your community in some way and how you have impacted it.\n\nThe amount of clinical hours that is considered \u201cgood\u201d varies depending on each person\u2019s experience, but generally a few hundred would be solid for most people (200-300). For community service, try to have at least 100 before you apply.",

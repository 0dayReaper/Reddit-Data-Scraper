    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all \u2014 I\u2019m an incoming masters student and I need to get started on finding a place to stay in Philly. Ideally I\u2019d love to room with another first-time Penn affiliate, whether that be a masters or a PhD student, so I\u2019ve been trying to get into the Penn specific FB housing group. \n\nI submitted my request to join the group about two weeks ago and I still haven\u2019t gotten a response. I messaged admin on FB and Kopa on their website, all to no avail. It looks like everyday there are on average 10 new posts, and it\u2019s been really frustrating not being able to get involved. I don\u2019t wanna keep missing out on potential roommates / spots. I feel like a sad kid standing in the snow looking through the glass at the candy store.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with kopa? The last university I was at didn\u2019t have it and it was so easy to join the group and get involved. I could be wrong, but this feels like a classic example of an impersonal company getting in the way of something that should be community moderated\u2026\n\nIn any case, does anyone have advice on what I should do? Do I just keep waiting it out? Is the housing group actually that active? Am I missing out on much? Thanks in advance!",

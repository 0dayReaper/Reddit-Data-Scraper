    "postText": "I am an incoming ECS master's student and I am trying to figure out how many classes I can realistically take. I love taking classes and there are so many that I want to take, but I also don't want to overwhelm myself. Currently, I have scheduled myself for 4.5 credits, but there are 2 additional classes that I want to take outside of my program (French 1214--I was a French major in undergrad and have really missed taking French classes-- and AFRC 3515 which is just desperately interesting). The French and Africana Studies courses aren't specifically graduate classes, so I don't know how to consider them in terms of effort required outside of class. I basically flew through undergrad taking the max amount of credits for a full time student plus an additional credit, but I don't know if I can pull that off in grad school. Would it be crazy to try?",

Not horrible but I\u2019m genuinely so confused. \n\nProbably going to email the prof about this but I was wondering that if he says \u2018oh I forgot to upload xyz grades all semester\u2019 if I can do anything about it or am I just taking the (minor) L on this one. Any advice on how to go about this email would be appreciated as well!",

Canvas not matching final grade is a perfectly good reason to ask - and while it's a small difference, it isn't nothing, especially when you haven't taken many courses yet. A 3.7 vs 4.0 now will affect the GPA you might put on internship apps for next summer, e.g.\n\nI'd make the subject line something like \"\\[COURSE XXXX\\] Grade on Canvas not matching posted grade\" or something like that to really make it clear from the get go that you're asking if an error was made, not grade grubbing.\n\nKeep it short and polite, and be clear you're chill if the answer is no (eg ask if there were grades that were not posted, or something)",

Sometimes, I\u2019ve asked professors even months after grades are initially due about not even \u201cgrade grubbing\u201d but simply just reviewing things like my final exam. They\u2019ve then found errors in the grading and bumped up the grade a bit back to the supposed grade if it was calculated erroneously.",

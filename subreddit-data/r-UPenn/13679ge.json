    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m an incoming freshman at Wharton and I\u2019m hoping to pursue an uncoordinated dual degree in SEAS. I\u2019ve heard GPA is extremely important in recruiting, so I don\u2019t want taking on an extra degree to negatively affect my Wharton GPA. So my question is: when doing an uncoordinated dual degree, do you have two GPAs, one for each school, or do you have one overall GPA?",

It's a ton of extra workload for uncoordinated (think taking 6-7 credits a semester instead of 4-5). Very few jobs actually utilize two full degrees. If you're interested in getting exposure/ taking some classes you're interested in I really strongly just recommend getting a minor. Alternatively you can even just take classes that you're interested in and forget about the minor. I love history and was considering getting the history minor, but I didn't feel like meeting all the regional requirements for the history minor so I just took 8 history classes in my field of interest. These degrees/minors matter way less than you think I promise you! Don't get sucked into the mindset of taking on additional degrees for more prestige/clout because I promise nobody really cares that much.",

It does help to be a hard STEM major (i.e. CIS, EE, MEAM, Math, Phys, etc) if you plan on getting a lower GPA lol but honestly a 2.9 gpa student can in theory get the same job offer as a 3.9 gpa student even at one of those prime names. The only places where a low undergrad GPA will impact you is if you plan on going to med/law school or PhD right after college, or if you want to apply for a 2+2 MBA program.\n\nIm not sure why every freshman thinks this but the GPA madness has to stop lol. Instead, I recommend taking hard classes that will challenge you and take a slight hit to GPA.",

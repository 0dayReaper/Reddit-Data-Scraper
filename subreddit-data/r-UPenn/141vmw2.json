Upcoming Class of 2027 here and feeling slightly overwhelmed with all the choices I have to make for Fall so I wanted to reach out and see if anyone here participated in the Pre-Orientation Programs and would like to share their experience! I am currently drawn to PennArts as I am a dancer and would love the explore that scene at Penn, however, the page on the UPENN website does not give much information on what the program entails and I would like to know if it\u2019s more inclined to visual or performing arts. Thank you in advance!",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a research peer advisor on campus, and I am doing an outreach project where I am making a graphic research guide for students that includes various interviews from students currently involved in research. The \"interview\" basically consists of a google form about your interests, experiences, etc. that shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes to fill (also not all of the fields are mandatory). It's also for a really good cause and would be extremely helpful. Thanks!!!\n\n  \n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSff8Nlt1vtwv\\_CIKeAmOxU2gPtP1pm2X9uYYsgjc76PBO3r2A/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSff8Nlt1vtwv_CIKeAmOxU2gPtP1pm2X9uYYsgjc76PBO3r2A/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m a prospective pre-med student wanting to double major (one science and one humanities, but I might change my mind and do one major and one minor instead), so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even worth it to apply to BFS. \n\nDo the scholars get any perks? What about being a BFS is different from an average student at Penn? And on the website it says BFS students are required to take 3 of their seminars, but is there anything else? \n\nFinally, people who are in the BFS program right now, please let me know if you like it! \n\nThank you :)))",

            "comment": "BFS is pretty fun if you're really into academics. You also all live together in a certain dorm (IDK which one it is this year). I think literally all of my friends were in BFS with me or people I met through a BFS friend.\n\nThe 3 seminars thing is a pretty chill requirement, may be annoying if your credits are tight. The difficult part of BFS is the Integrated Studies Program (ISP). All BFS scholars take the same 2-credit class together for each semester of their freshman year. It's probably going to be 2 lectures and a recitation/2 lectures and a lab or something like that. It will also probably be a lot of reading. This is something you have to give thought to. Maybe the topics that these classes introduce to you are going to help you choose your major. But it might also be better to take 4 other classes that you choose on your own (since ISP takes up 4 classes of your freshman year). I personally regret BFS for academic reasons. Not only was it pretty hard, I also wish I took other classes in its stead. But this is probably just because I was super undecided. If you're set on pre-med, and thinking of both humanities and sciences, BFS will probably be good for you. Maybe try talking to BFS pre-meds to sort out how BFS helps/hurts the pre-med track requirements. \n\nTLDR will take up a lot of academic credits freshman year. May be good for your social life. Great if you're very academics-oriented.",

            "comment": "I'm doing BFS right now. Similar to the other commenter, I will warn you that in the college (and only in the college - a sore point for many of us in the program), the requirements are not merely the 3 seminars, but the main portion is the Integrated Studies Program (ISP), which is half of your schedule in your freshman year (4 credits). (This. is far from the only discrepancy in treatment you will see as a student in the college, but you won't understand that until you get here). These courses fluctuate in difficulty throughout each semester, and also depend on how much work you personally put in (for example, some professors assign over 10 hours of reading per week and openly say it could take more than that, but I don't know anyone who actually spends this much time on readings. Most people learn to skim, and some people basically don't do the readings at all). \"I hate ISP\" is a common thing to hear, and if you don't do the program but end up living in Hill College House (where all BFS kids live), you'll likely hear about 10 page papers on back to back weeks at least a few times.\n\nA lot of people actually drop the program in between semesters too, we started the year with 80 in the college and are currently at 49.\n\nThis is not to say that it is all bad, after all there is a reason I did it. I would say the best part of the program is definitely the people. Penn in a really pre-professional place (this is something you probably hear all the time but doesn't really make sense until you get here), and having people around who who genuinely care about learning in at least some capacity is really helpful, and I made a lot of great friends (in fact, I would say that almost all of my friends are BFS or BFS dropouts) \n\nIn terms of other perks, I would say that you will end up taking classes that you likely never would have taken before, and get to think about things in an interdisciplinary way, which in somewhat lacking at Penn despite the marketing saying otherwise. The classes are also much more depth than regular intro level classes. The mark on your diploma honestly doesn't mean that much in my opinion, but it is a distinction to add to the resume if that matters to you. We also have occasional field trips, events giving information on academic opportunities, movie nights, etc. (though all of these except the field trips are pretty open to anyone if you have friends in the program). A lot of this is just to build community, as is the fact that everyone lives in the same college house. Hill in my opinion was a much better fit for me than the quad, but that depends on the person. There is some research funding and such you can apply for too, and I think they're starting a peer mentorship program next year.\n\nAll of that being said, considering how undecided I was, I do mostly regret BFS, since it didn't let me take the classes that related to things I was interested in, and untimely that matters more than a small extra distinction, but that's only because of how undecided I am. If you have a clear idea of what you want to do in the future, than I would say ISP isn't too bad, as long as you're okay with possibly needing to take slightly more classes in later semesters. I know a lot of premeds doing it, and they're fine. I would apply if the classes interest you, but definitely don't do it just for the extra recognition because I personally don't think you get as much out as you put in, and there are a lot of other things you can apply for that are far less work. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

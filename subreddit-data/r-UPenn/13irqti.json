            "comment": "Lauder/Hill are more modern and have better city access but quad is more social (although there have been criticisms abt outdated appliances)\n\nthis also depends on whether you want a single. Lauder has individual bedrooms within a suite, which has a shared bathroom/living room (suite residents are responsible for maintenance). Hill has communal bathrooms, but they aren\u2019t stalls and have separate doors, which is an up from quad. also, only ~10% of Hill residents get singles and the rooms are significantly smaller.\n\nofc there are other options like kcech, gregory, etc. but these are thought to be the best in addition to quad",

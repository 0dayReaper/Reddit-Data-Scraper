I had people organize small \u2018fun\u2019 gatherings in quad, hill, kcheck. The best friends i made at Penn had nothing to with our dorms, and we would then hang out/pg/smoke wherever. If you make friends who like to party, you will be mostly going to frats anyway. Lauder is a bit far from wharton tbh, if you\u2019re ready to walk 10+ minutes every day to class during snowing winter, go for it. I had a single in the quad and loved it. It was cozy, well-lit, and I was lucky to get hardwood floors as opposed to tiles. Hope this helps!",

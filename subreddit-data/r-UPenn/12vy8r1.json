    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman on the premed track\u2026. Math 1300 is listed as a pre/co req for chem but I\u2019ve heard they don\u2019t actually check when you register? I was wondering if it would be okay to save math 1300 until junior spring or senior year after finishing all the required pre med science courses in order to lighten my stem load for freshman and sophomore year? Or is taking calculus sooner important to do well in any of the pre med science classes/ on the mcat?",

In the past they used to not check if you had completed the pre reqs but as of this academic year the registration website was updated and pre reqs are checked. Or at least that\u2019s what Penn has told us. I\u2019ve not tried to take a class without the pre reqs. \n\nOne thing you can try is when adding classes to your primary cart in path@penn you can click on request permission. You get to write a few sentences to make your case and someone in the department will read it and either accept or deny your request. \n\nAnother think you might try is adding both classes to your cart and dropping the one you don\u2019t want during add drop period. \n\nI would suggest getting math done sooner rather than later. You said you will have a heavy stem load your first two years. There is a good chance that some calculus appears in some of those classes. Not to say that you have too. A pre med person would have a better idea of the order to take those classes.",

Not that you can\u2019t but also each course is taught by different professors and the quality of their teaching can range pretty significantly. Only regular Professor I\u2019ve had who was at least decent was Blake for 102, and others I have heard mixed things about. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not a physics buff, but still good to possibly get a little familiar with the content before taking them regardless of what you get.",

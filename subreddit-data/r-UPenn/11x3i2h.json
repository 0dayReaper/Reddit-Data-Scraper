            "comment": "**Photos at the bottom of the post!**\n\nHey everyone!\r  \nI\u2019m Mason, I live in West Philly on Powelton Ave not far from Drexel and Penn's Campus. I have two rooms available August 1st so you can be an individual who wants to take just one of the rooms or a pair looking to grab both! You could even be an individual looking to take both and turn the exdtra space into an office or workout space.  \n\r  \nThe larger front room is available for $1098 a month\r  \nthe smaller rear room is available for 710 a month  \n\r  \nBut of course you don't just get the room. Not only is the house in a great and safe location close to both Drexel and Penn\u2019s campus, but it was renovated just a few short years ago so it's new, modern, spacious, and comfortable. It's a 2679 sqr foot with 2.5 bathrooms, plenty of space with 4 floors with a spacious living room, kitchen, and a basement. The house also has central heating and plenty of high-quality appliances like a washer dryer, dishwasher, and a gas stove among other things.  \n\r  \nYou'd be moving into the third floor, which has a full bathroom, and the two available bedrooms. Check out the attached photos for a floorplan. The washer and dryer are also on the landing between the second and third floor, so it's easily accessible. These rooms will be unfurnished when you move in.  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, the living room and kitchen on the first floor will be furnished, as you can see pictured below. My current housemate will take the TV and the bar cart, (as well as one of the toasters in the kitchen) but otherwise, everything pictured will be there when you move in. There's plenty of space to have people over or to just relax as the sun shines in. The house gets amazing natural lighting throughout. As for the kitchen, all of the appliances are some of the latest models that all work great.  \n\r  \nWe're incredibly close to a bunch of great local businesses and restaurants, including a soft-serve ice cream spot, bubble tea, a tiny cafe, and more pizza places than you\u2019ll need. The house is also very close to a Hospital and is within walking distance of two grocery stores and plenty of convenience stores.  \n\r  \nWe're also in a super safe area, with University City\u2019s Public Safety Office just a block away. Moving in also comes with the perk of living with a cute, kind, and cuddly medium-sized dog that you don't have to take care of at all!  \n\r  \nAs for who you'll be living with, I'm a 24-year-old guy working as a freelance video editor. I'm 420 friendly, and I spend most of my free time with my dog, playing D&amp;D, running, and watching comedy shows or Survivor. I'm welcoming and accepting of all people, so this is a BIPOC &amp; LGBTQIA+ Friendly space and I hope you are accepting too so that doesn't change. Anyone is welcome here, regardless of gender identity, race, sexuality, etc.\r  \nRent does not include utilities.  \n\r  \nPlease reach out to me via DM if you are interested so we can schedule a time for us to meet and check out the house, or if you just want some more details!\r  \nBe sure to act quickly so you don't miss out on this great place to live!  \n[Floorplan](https://imgur.com/gw343Iv)  \n[Living Room](https://preview.redd.it/9dyphqr1epta1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=15d88d2d34a5bd2b30c3187b7989d1c67b1ecfab)  \n[Living Room Perspective 2](https://preview.redd.it/04eatsr1epta1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ddce0c314ef4dcc4131849fb95a926ec02777fca)  \n[Kitchen on First Floor](https://preview.redd.it/nlihlnr1epta1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d14b3002d1c55d985af9123ff1bea77fff609f9a)  \n[Stairwell](https://preview.redd.it/yobzxnr1epta1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b63dcd9b7f2203d618986ec7f3ce475d467102ce)  \n[Stairwell and .5 Bathroom](https://preview.redd.it/75z90g6cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b85225add5ce362c91518497c0834b08505766fa)  \n[Stairwell and Laundry Unit](https://preview.redd.it/75z90g6cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b85225add5ce362c91518497c0834b08505766fa)  \n[Stairwell and Third Floor](https://preview.redd.it/pzr4c46cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d25a71699ad87c425f509f6564806b758ec387e2)  \n[Large Room on Third Floor](https://preview.redd.it/y0c7766cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f573c7f8e7a4cfad64e2f4a26c9d4705047e57af)  \n[Large room on Third Floor Perspective 2](https://preview.redd.it/tergth6cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=19304428318a70e0c42d8722d83253a315e22575)  \n[Smaller Room on Third floor](https://preview.redd.it/kdath66cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a0d8711c8e7d3bd07dcd79bbc6ea21beaa385f0)  \n[Third Floor Full Bathroom](https://preview.redd.it/wg6c486cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b572a194045a8d01508e18a04ba2486cec183e19)",

            "comment": "**Photos at the bottom of the post!**\n\nHi, I'm a Drexel Alum who graduated last year. I currently live in a townhouse on Powelton Avenue and 36th just a short walk away from Drexel and Penn's Campus.\n\nI'm looking to continue my lease, and am searching for one or two people who would want to move in.\n\nNot only is the house in a great and safe location, but it was renovated just a few short years ago so it's new, modern, spacious, and comfortable. It's a 2679 sqr foot with 2.5 bathrooms, plenty of space with 4 floors including a basement, central heating, and plenty of high-quality appliances like a washer dryer, dishwasher, and a gas stove among other things.\n\nYou'd be moving into the third floor, which has its own full bathroom, one large bedroom, and a smaller room that could be used as an office, workout space, or anything else you could want. It has also been used as a bedroom in the past, so if you have a friend you planned on living with you can both have space and privacy. The washing and drying unit is also on the landing between the second and third floor, so it's easily accessible. These rooms will be unfurnished when you move in.\n\nOn the other hand, the living room and kitchen on the first floor will be furnished, as you can see pictured below. My current roommate will take the TV and the bar cart, (as well as one of the toasters in the kitchen) but otherwise, everything pictured will be there when you move in. There's plenty of space to have people over or to just relax as the sun shines in. The house gets amazing natural lighting throughout. As for the kitchen,  all of the appliances are some of the latest models that all work great.\n\nWe're incredibly close to CoCo's, Spring Chinese, Woosa, and the Hospital, and is a short walk to Ed's, Savas, Chipotle, and the Heirloom Market. We're also in a super safe area, with Drexel's Public Safety office just a block away. Moving in also comes with the perk of living with a cute, kind, and cuddly medium-sized dog that you don't have to take care of at all!\n\nAs for who you'll be living with, I'm a pretty chill 24 year old man working as a freelance video editor. I'm 420 friendly, and spend most of my free time with my dog, playing D&amp;D, running, cooking, and watching comedy shows or Survivor. I'm welcoming and accepting of all people, so this is a BIPOC &amp; LGBTQIA+ Friendly space and I hope you are accepting too because I don't want that to change. Anyone is welcome here regardless of gender identity, race, sexuality, and so on.\n\nMy current housemate's rent is $1808 a month for a whole floor, the shared living space, and the basement. That can be split among two people if you and a friend move in. I'd also be willing to discuss readjusting that rent price if that's a bit too much for a single person to take on.\n\nRent does not include utilities. Please reach out to me via DM if you are interested so we can schedule a time for us to meet and check out the house, or if you just want some more details! Be sure to act quickly so you don't miss out on this great place to live!\n\n[Living Room](https://preview.redd.it/9dyphqr1epta1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=15d88d2d34a5bd2b30c3187b7989d1c67b1ecfab)\n\n[Living Room Perspective 2](https://preview.redd.it/04eatsr1epta1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ddce0c314ef4dcc4131849fb95a926ec02777fca)\n\n[Kitchen on First Floor](https://preview.redd.it/nlihlnr1epta1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d14b3002d1c55d985af9123ff1bea77fff609f9a)\n\n[Stairwell](https://preview.redd.it/yobzxnr1epta1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b63dcd9b7f2203d618986ec7f3ce475d467102ce)\n\n[Stairwell and .5 Bathroom](https://preview.redd.it/75z90g6cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b85225add5ce362c91518497c0834b08505766fa)\n\n[Stairwell and Laundry Unit](https://preview.redd.it/xifj4a6cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=503c21e65a07daec767c473a1bda321c1ad8b729)\n\n[Stairwell and Third Floor](https://preview.redd.it/pzr4c46cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d25a71699ad87c425f509f6564806b758ec387e2)\n\n[Large Room on Third Floor](https://preview.redd.it/y0c7766cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f573c7f8e7a4cfad64e2f4a26c9d4705047e57af)\n\n[Large room on Third Floor Perspective 2](https://preview.redd.it/tergth6cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=19304428318a70e0c42d8722d83253a315e22575)\n\n[Smaller Room on Third floor](https://preview.redd.it/kdath66cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a0d8711c8e7d3bd07dcd79bbc6ea21beaa385f0)\n\n[Third Floor Full Bathroom](https://preview.redd.it/wg6c486cdpta1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b572a194045a8d01508e18a04ba2486cec183e19)",

You can add photos of your place and anyone publicly can see and filter based on their needs. The general idea is to make something a little more helpful than comment threads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm doing a soft opening here before sending it to the broader community, so I would love it if you guys added your sublets.

                            "comment": "You should obviously know how to find derivatives and do basic integrals. Math 1410 is not focused on doing difficult single variable integrals. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll have to do anything more than a simple u-substitution, or maybe integration by parts. (I tutor 1410 and I think I\u2019ve seen one quiz where students had to do a trig substitution, but 99% of the time you won\u2019t need any advanced integration methods.)\n\nThe real difficulty with integration in 1410 comes with double and triple integrals where you need to think geometrically and do stuff like change between different coordinate systems (e.g. Cartesian to spherical coordinates). But this doesn\u2019t require 1400 knowledge.\n\nYou should also be comfortable with parametrizing lines in the plane (writing x and y in terms of a single variable t.) Eventually you\u2019ll also have to parameterize surfaces in 3D in terms of two variables.\n\nYou also should be familiar with Taylor series (e.g. you should know the series for sin(x), ln(1 + x), etc.), but you won\u2019t have to test infinite series for convergence or anything like that.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much advantage to taking 1400 when you already have Calc BC credit. You might learn a small number of new topics not taught in BC, and you might get a bit more mathematical \u201cmaturity.\u201d But you\u2019ll risk dropping your GPA, since 1400 has notoriously tricky quizzes, and skipping 1400 could give you more freedom to take a course that interests you more.",

Since they assume you already know calc bc content, the questions are never centered around those topics and normally are fairly straight forward( there\u2019s only one quiz involving Taylor series and you don\u2019t do anything with them other than plugging numbers into those formulas). Thus you can essentially learn those concepts the week of. I\u2019m also a 1410 TA so if you have any more specific concepts, I\u2019d be happy to help :)",

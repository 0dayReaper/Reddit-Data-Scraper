    "postText": "I know you guys have seen a thousand post like these so I apologize in advance. I was accepted in Penn-Wharton, Princeton, Columbia, and Cornell but I boiled my choices down to Wharton Vs Princeton. I plan on going into IB or consulting after my undergrad and I\u2019m looking to go where I\u2019d have access to the most opportunities. That being said I know that Wharton and Princeton are almost identical in terms of access to opportunities and no choice that I make would be wrong. I\u2019ve participated in Penn programs like PIF &amp; PEEP and talked with student leaders so I\u2019ve developed a strong connection to Penn. At the same time I\u2019ve fallen in love with Princeton as a school in terms of the focus on the undergrad and the strong alumni network. As of now the deciding factor is fin-aid and also the curriculum. I really love the curriculum at Wharton since I feel like it would prepare me for my future career but at the same time I understand the value of having a liberal arts education (Princeton). \n\nI\u2019m honestly super conflicted right now so I could really use some advice \ud83d\ude2d",

If you don't have that inate \"I hope it's tails\" feeling then just go with what the coin says. There's no wrong answer here.\n\nAlternately, for a spreadsheet nerd: make some sort of spreadsheet where you list out all the factors you care about, assign a weight to each factor, then assign a winner for each factor and sum up the totals by school to make your decision.",

            "comment": "Penn grad here, didn\u2019t apply to Princeton. I was college Econ with several IB offers. No bad answer here, but a few things I\u2019d consider:\n\n - what are you looking for culture-wise? Having spent some time on Princeton campus, it\u2019s a little preppier and, to my eye, somewhat less social and more cliquey. Penn is a party school. \n\n- princeton is much more rural. It\u2019s easy to get to NYC or Philly from princeton, but if you like the idea of college in a city, you might want to lean toward Penn\n\n- frankly, a lot of people think they want to do IB or consulting and will change their minds in college. Princeton will give you a more well-rounded education that can help you go lots of different directions, but will still get you to IB or Consulting if that\u2019s what you want.  If you\u2019re top of class at Wharton, you\u2019ll have your pick of bulge brackets and top consulting firms. Maybe even VC or PE. \n\n- Princeton is probably a bit more congenial and less blatantly competitive than Wharton. If you\u2019re the competitive type, you might like wharton. If you\u2019re not, you might not. \n\n- if you might be interested in grad school (apart from MBA), princeton might be a leg up\n\n- I transitioned from finance to tech (which seems to be where all the cool young smart kids are now). The kids I interview from Wharton for roles in my company are less well prepared than kids with well-rounded ivy+ educations like Stanford, Harvard, or princeton. I haven\u2019t hired anybody from Penn.",

            "comment": "Let's start with the market: the Central Bank just announced to shrink its balance sheet. The expansionist policies since 2008 end, meaning less capital avail. Start-ups, companies still making a loss and tech is affected most. Also, less business for the finance sector.\n\nimo, the market is moving towards industrials and businesses with mature business models. Jobs that really benefit the society will flourish, e.g. SpaceX and medical devices, but crazy, e.g. Cryto, or loss-making business wanes.\n\nThen back to industry: if you really love the nature of IB and consulting, then go for it. If you work for money or prestige, these are not good choices since the market will be different. Anyways, Wharton offer better training in finance and the alumni network in business is slightly better (more alumni). Princeton business training is less diverse but still provide decent training in traditional positions such as IB.\n\nIf you aim at consulting, logic, problems solving skills, persuasion and executive presence are weighed the most, not your major.\n\nCulture-wise, Wharton is very pre-occupational. The 1st semester is like a school, but starting from the 2nd, Penn becomes a large corporation, whose students are more like colleagues or even competitors than friends or at least classmates. Students mostly expect more interpersonal experiences than striving 3.5 years long for internships, networking, graduate job, spots in enrichment programs, part-time jobs, studying 2 degrees in 4 years and submatriculation into masters programs.\n\nSuggestion: culture is important. Besides, I suggest doing engineering/computer science/data  science/life science degree, and business because 1. you may change your goal, 2. if you are money driven, these combinations offer the best prospect, 3. business sector seeks people with training in these degrees, e.g. VC love technical degrees, PE is incorporating data science into its every work, consulting use machine learning (a subset of computer science), 4. Penn and Princeton allow students to pursue science/engineering and business in the curriculum, and 5. these combinations allow working on your own or start your little business in future.\n\nimo doing business + engineering/computer science/data science/life science is the greatest asset for the 2 schools. You may do an uncoordinated dual degree in Penn, and Science/engeering major with certificates in finance and/or entreprenship in Princeton.",

            "comment": "You seem really prepared to make this decision.  You appear to be answering your own question when you say the deciding factors are curriculum and fin-aid.  The latter is simply a waiting game which by now should be over with (although you can sometimes apply to amend your packages!).  You can get very specific information on both schools on their web-sites and the departmental web sites (your post may get taken down because of rule issues with reddit).  You should also know that you can change your mind and many undergrads do about programs and both schools have much to offer.  The schools have very different campus settings which of course you know and while Upon (and Wharton) is of course a highly ranked top ten University by most of the ranking publishers, Princeton is historically considered part of that first tier (HYPMitStanford) (which is a prestige and perception thing)  but obviously there are arguably 5 or 10 schools that can be argued are their \"equal\" or are more appropriate or better for for you and your interests, including Penn.  I think if you walk through either campus on a nice Spring day during classes, you will get a vibe and you will know. Its a very happy problem to have. Congratulations",

If you want a competitive, _professionally_ oriented program v. a more flexible, liberal arts curriculum, choose Wharton. \n\nVisit both schools.

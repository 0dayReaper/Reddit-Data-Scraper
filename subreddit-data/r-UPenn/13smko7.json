He teaches on the chalkboard, but he made a large effort to record his lectures with the camera zoomed in on the correct board. \n\nIMO, there\u2019s less stuff to memorize since the only things that\u2019ll be on the test are things he has explicitly written and discussed on the chalkboard (compared to 50+ slides that could be glossed over).",

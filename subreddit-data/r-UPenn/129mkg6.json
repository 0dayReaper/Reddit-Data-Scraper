    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI'm a first-year at Penn considering taking a summer course to knock out a pre-med requirement (want to so that I won't be forced to triple up on STEM courses down the line). However, the courses at Penn are super expensive (I'm aided but not highly, so I'd most likely have to eat the $5.5k cost). \n\nThing is, the course I'm looking to take does have approved courses through XCAT at other universities. In particular, there's an online asynchronous course that looks to be cheaper ($2.5k), shorter, and less of a time requirement per week (planning to do PURM as well). I'm a little bit worried about the way that taking the course would come off to medical schools, especially since it wouldn't report a GPA on my Penn transcript and I don't want them to assume I'm taking the easy way out. \n\nIf anyone has any tips or suggestions about what I should do, or even summer classes for pre-med in general, please reach out!",

At the end of the day, when you apply to medical schools, it's about your ability to meaningfully defend and explain your actions.\n\nFor example, if taking classes outside of UPenn made more sense over the summer financially, then isn't that the wiser decision? Why would that look bad? Why is being financially responsible bad?\n\nIf you're worried about what it looks like on paper, then just get good grades and do well on the MCAT. There are people who go through community colleges and still get into medical schools.\n\nYou're about to take *extra* classes in the summer, and you're worried that would look bad? You're already at a top institution in the country. Breathe a little. Adjust your priorities and focus on why you want to be a physician in the first place. Why is it important that you speed up your timeline? Instead of maybe spending time with friends and family over the summer? Find a good balance in life and build a meaningful narrative.",

I think we can assume she inflated her time at foster care or something for the Rhodes app? Not exactly sure what the Rhodes Trust found that was misleading about her foster care / injuries but they found enough evidence to release her.... but what Penn did in response to Rhodes was probably dumb, there was no reason to take away her master's degree\n\nthere's kids who inflate about what they did in college during the job internships process and that doesn't even warrant taking away someone's college degree... it does warrant not giving that kid a job tho",

Its all appalling really. So what if M spent less than a year in foster care? They are still a FGLI student by FGLI\u2019s own definition. So, Penn can fuck off. Another asswipe mediocre admin ruining the lives of people who are vulnerable and protecting assholes at castle.",

                                    "comment": "yeah I don't think the issue is M spending a few months in foster care.  I think the issue is that she inflated the amount of time she said she spent in foster care. My guess is if she had truthfully stated exactly how many months she had been in the system, none of this would have occurred. I doubt both the Rhodes Trust AND Penn (2 independent institutions) would come to the same conclusion about her application if not for her inflating/lying about something easily disprovable. Foster care is one of those things that there are clear gov records of that are easy to subpoena. The start and end dates are easy to acquire I assume.\n\nIt does suck that someone like her, who obviously came from a chaotic background, has to face this scenario. I don't see why its fair at all to take her degrees away even if she said she was in foster care for longer. The crime doesn't fit the punishment. But, I think this does bring up the conversation about whether trauma can be completely disqualified if someone finds a minor lie in your story. For example, there used to be this police officer in my town who was well known for serving in Iraq, surviving an IED blast, etc. He also kind of became a champion for PTSD and wounded vets. Turns out he had lied about the IED blast but he had still served in combat over a couple tours and been shot at. It was a complicated scenario but he made an apologetic speech at church one day and cleared his image like in good midwest fashion.",

There are real questions about whether Penn - through this reporter - were the ones inflating the story to gain positive publicity for the university. When the story of her Rhodes Scholarship achievement made national news, Penn was contacted by some of the people who knew her back in St. Louis and who objected to the Inquirer\u2019s characterization of her growing up poor. Penn was in contact with her vindictive mother during this period. After assessing that the new publicity was a net negative for the university, Penn, who had endorsed her Rhodes application, did a 180 and reported her to the Rhodes foundation, which biased the Rhodes investigation from the beginning.\n\nThe fact is that she was removed from her home at the beginning of her junior year in high school and entered the foster care system. She spent her final 2 years of high school and her entire time in college estranged from her mother and without any financial or other support from home. For those who object to the length of time she spent in foster care as too short, it should be noted that adolescence is the most common time for children to enter the foster care system because that\u2019s when the situation reaches crisis level. But typically as in this case, the abuse had been going on for years before it became public.\n\nAn update on the current status of the situation was published some weeks ago in the Daily Pennsylvanian, Penn\u2019s campus newspaper. The case continues to work its way through the courts. The court has ordered the university president and other Penn officials to be deposed. Mackenzie remains committed to seeing the case through to its conclusion.",

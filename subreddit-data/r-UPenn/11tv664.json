Midterms are worth very little. I think like in-class activities were worth 45%.\n4. The final project is very lenient.\n5. Professor Hoffman sends out a weekly form asking if there are ways to better update class. \n6. He is great with responses. Whenever I needed to discuss something, he responds quickly.\n7. The man is really passionate about paleontology. \n\nOverall, it's a great class 10/10.",

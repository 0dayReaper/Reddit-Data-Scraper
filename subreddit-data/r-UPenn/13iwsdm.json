            "comment": "Idk about the textbook but my #1 piece of advice is to buy the book \u201cOrganic chemistry as a second language\u201d. It introduces orgo concepts in a very straightforward, simple way. \n\nMany profs recommend skimming the orgo textbook before class to help prepare you for lecture. I found the orgo textbooks to be pretty dense\u2026I never got much out of reading them before class. Instead, I would read the corresponding sections of this book. Orgo lectures began to make so much more sense after I started doing this. Then after class, you can go through the actual orgo textbook for more detailed info. \n\nGood luck!!",

We used Wade + Simek but that might've changed (the last 2-3 previous versions should work; lots of textbooks keep the content the same but add new practice problems here or there between versions).\n\nAdvice: Be prepared to work your **fucking** tail off. But if you do put the hours in, you'll be handsomely rewarded -- chemistry is so interesting and beautiful! Orgo was seriously one of my favorite courses in college and what convinced me to get a chem minor.\n\n* If you can, get additional resources/textbooks (with solution manuals). Can be helpful to hear the same concepts be explained by multiple people.\n* Do as much practice as you can. Others may have better techniques for learning things, but I would normally repeat questions I got wrong until I knew the intuition/logic behind the problem cold.\n* Homework problems + past midterms = holy grail.\n* Go to office hours!\n* Know concepts from gen chem cold. Resonance structures are a big one. Be prepared to memorize a lot of stuff/understand how you personally learn best.\n\ngl;hf!",

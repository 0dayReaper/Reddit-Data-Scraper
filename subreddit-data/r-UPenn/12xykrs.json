    "postText": "im currently trying to register for orgo lab, but i notice that many of them take place at 8:30 am, which doesn't work for my schedule (10:15 classes, etc). however, i notice that there's not a lot of other times that orgo lab takes place - and the reasonable times are all locked airtight with no room to join. im wondering why orgo lab times have been so poorly designed in this way, and if space will open up during the summer to join one of the more reasonable time slots. i know that people will be dropping after the semester is over, but i've never really had experience with orgo before so i would like to know the dynamic of the class/how many ppl add or drop the lab.",

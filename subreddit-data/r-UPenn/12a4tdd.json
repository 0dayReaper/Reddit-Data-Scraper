UPenn has much better grad programs than Dartmouth and Duke's CS program is realtively weak, although it is still a great school.\n\nHowever, Duke will likely be a more \"chill\" CS experience. UPenn CS is pretty hardcore in that you will likely be surrounded by stronger CS/math students and there isn't grade inflation. Also, Duke's culture in general is prob more chill than UPenn, so it really depends on the person.",

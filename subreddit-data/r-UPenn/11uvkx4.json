Doing anything in life just for the sake of checking a box is not always the greatest in terms of building a cohesive and a meaningful narrative about who you are and what your passions are. \n\nWhat are your post graduation plans? Does the field you want to enter have anything to do with research? You say you're not interested in research, but are there *other* skills besides research you can learn by pursuing this opportunity that *do* interest you? If you have spare time to do independent research, are there *other* places and opportunities where your efforts could be more wisely invested? \n\nResearch in general demands a certain level of patience and reverence. Don't do it *just* for an extra graduation cord. Good luck with whatever decision you make regarding this.",

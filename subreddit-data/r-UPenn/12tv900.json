            "comment": "&gt;Are UPenn offers unconditional?\n\nNo. And that's the case for basically every US university.\n\nAcceptance offers are conditional on, among other things, graduating HS, maintaining grades post-acceptance, continuing to be a valuable member of society (e.g. don't commit a felony, don't be racist on sicual media).\n\n&gt;I applied as an IB student and got in, but I\u2019m confused to know if the offer stays in place if I drop down in points?\n\nIf you are attending a school overseas, a slight drop in scores vs predicted will not be an issue. A 3 in a subject or an overall 30 will likely be problematic.",

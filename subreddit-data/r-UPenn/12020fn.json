It was last sem, and I just used ctrl+f through my notes (Notability &amp; Good Notes) and the textbook for the concepts used in the questions. It seemed like the majority of the questions were based on his lecture material. He would write certain things or draw diagrams and they would be helpful during exams. I don\u2019t know of any online study guides though.",

But u really don\u2019t have much time looking at your notes because it\u2019s 50 questions within 60 minutes. What does it means \u201c use Ctrl+f through the notes(notability and good notes \u201c? Is it a function? How does it work?",

For the exams I would use my laptop and have the canvas window open on one side of the screen and the online textbook open on the other. I also had my iPad out for my handwritten notes. For example, if there is a question about Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, I would use the search function in my notes app to search for \u201cmaslow\u201d or any other key terms from the question. I would also use the search function in the online textbook (it is the magnifying glass I think) and it would pull up any mentions of that key term in the book, &amp; you could click on the specific instance to go to the page. Most of the time i\u2019d just be searching through my notes because i felt like most of the questions were based on lectures. I also sorted my notes by writing the topic in big letters (ex. Memory, Types of Memories, Implicit Memories) so that within Goodnotes i could see the thumbnails of the pages on the side and quickly get to the right page.\n\nI mostly feel like note organization is key for these types of exams. Even though it\u2019s open book I still needed to \u201cstudy\u201d by familiarizing myself with my notes and glancing over the book.\n\nAlso, i usually had about 8-10 new pages of notes after each lecture.",

A competent guide can write a raft in well under a minute anyways, and that's from being in the water. Neat party trick and deff worth some beers but really not all that practical in a real scenario. I'd rather go back in the water and be 100% sure the raft is writed than risk having to remount the flipped boat, which is the part that's actually hard.",

So I'm a raft/river guide and I'd like to shed some light on this. \n\nI would not call this a survival technique so much as a way to look cool in front of your buddies or clients. This is pretty hard to pull off and you can be a world class raft guide and still be unable to dry flip.\n\n While yes, this reduces the amount of water you're exposed to in practice the reason a raft guide would want to do this is to be able to get people back into the boat faster (this is important in white water). That being said, if you were in whitewater this would be 10x harder to pull off. \n\nAs guides we always say \"dress for the water temperature, not the air\", basically, expect to get wet and dress accordingly i.e. a neoprene wetsuit or a dry suit if it is cold. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions!",

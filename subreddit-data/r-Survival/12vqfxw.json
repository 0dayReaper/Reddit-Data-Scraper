It got them through long winters. You can also keep meat in a clay vessel buried in the earth to keep cool for several days.

Plenty of very healthy things don't taste good. And everyone has different tastes. You might think something is awful and I think it's delicious.\n\nAlso, your somewhat wrong on the \"boiling destroys vitamin B.\"\n\nCooking meat does cause it to lose a lot of its vitamins and minerals. *when it's juices are allowed to run off*.  \n\nIf you collect those juices, as would happen when the meat is cooked in a pot of water, you keep 100% of the minerals and the majority of the vitamins, you will still lose some to being destroyed by heat.  But you also shouldn't be boiling, you should be simmering. The lower temp will help retain more nutrients that would get destroyed at a full boil.",

Killing a rabbit by hand can be done by placing your left thumb into the base of it's skull/top of the back of it's neck then pressing upward on the bottom of it's jaw with your right palm. Press towards your thumb so the rabbit head faces skyward. Press until the neck is broken. I've also dispatched rabbits by laying a pipe over the back of their neck, standing on the ends of the pipe, and pulling upward on the rabbits legs so the neck breaks under the pipe. These methods can both be found on YouTube.\n\nI kill animals with a knife frequently but these are animals I've raised. Chickens and turkeys I'll hang upside down in a tree and slice their throat to catch the blood in a bucket. Rabbits I still kill by hand. I can't fathom trying to accurately Alice their throat and contain them. I just think it would be messier than a broken neck. The birds are not real messy this way because I can control the blood pour by holding their head.",

The boiled water kills most things in it and with a simple forager guide you can find at any store you can find plenty of edible herbs, vegetables and fruit all around you even in an over grown lawn. No matter where you live there is plenty of native species of plants that people use to eat every day and that can all be made into a soup! You need protein yes but you need carbs, starches, fibers, fats and vitamins and minerals and all of that can and will have to come from plants at some point. The best part about native species is that give mother nature 3 weeks or she'll begin to retake the land and youll have access forever to what she has to offer as long as you can work with her.",

It will probably run, so you'll ironically have to go find it again after giving it some time to die. Once you've managed that, you'll want to field dress it by CAREFULLY removing the GI tract. Field dressing impedes spoilage and makes the carcass lighter, which is important for the next step. \n\nYou'll now need to haul it out from wherever you managed to kill it to your vehicle or home. How you plan to do this should be figured out in detail well beforehand. \n\nCongratulations, you still have a fair bit of work left. You need to skin it and do the first round of butchering. Good knives and an appropriate work area are vital for this. Generally speaking, you'll want to cut off the bits not worth eating like the head and hooves. There are also likely some glands you will want to cut out too.The lungs aren't good for much, but save the heart and, if you like it, the liver. If you have a refrigerated meat locker, you will want to let the carcass hang in it for at least 5 days for the blood to drain the collegen to break down some. If you don't have one, quarter it and put the pieces on absorbent paper on the shelves of a fridge instead. \n\nAfter letting it hang, you now need to decide how you want to finish butchering it. Good knives are must but, there are other tools worth considering. Save the long bones for broth when you're done. Pack the meat in butcher paper or vacuum seal it. Then freeze it.",

After that, hang it by the hindlegs, cut the neck, skin it and let it drain, disenbowel from front to back, making sure the content stays inside. Save the liver, maybe the kidneys after rinsing them properly and toss the rest of the entrails. Then prep the meat according to taste/skill, etc.\n\nQuick, clean kills are important.

I\u2019m a big elk and deer hunter, and while I have generally been taught lots by older family members through my youth, I got away from hunting for many years. Getting back into it, there is a plethora of great field dressing (gutting and quartering animals to pack out) right down to tasty meal how tos all on the wonderful world of YouTube. Highly recommend figuring out what types of animals you will encounter in your area and then searching how to properly field dress (squirrel, rabbit, porquipine, deer, ect) in YouTube. Vast knowledge with video tutorial.\n\nAs the saying goes, 1000 different ways to skin a cat. You will find what works. Best first advice is to hone your accuracy skills with whatever weapon choice you take with you. If you are accurate at 100m on a target, only take shots at 3/4 that distance in the wild. You will become excited and raised heart rate can cause much lower accuracy. Another good tip is fast sprint (50-100m) 20-50 jumping jacks and push-ups, then pick up your weapon and aim and fire at target while practicing as that helps stimulate the adrenaline you will feel in the moment, especially if you have never killed an animal.",

Practice on lots on butchering and cooking small game. If you\u2019re hungry it out in the woods it\u2019s going to make it hard to hunt. It\u2019s going to make it even hard to butcher. So practice is your best bet. \nNot gonna get in the nutrition-preservation/cooking-method debate, but there are lots of ways to cook in the field without any utensils or cooking tooks\u2014Including burying your food in a coal pit, etc. Whatever works for you. But still practice your methods. Again consuming the entire animal is great. But believe it or not, that takes practice too.",

I know where you are coming from, and suffering alone will probably only lead to you dying. Running away to the south american rainforest isn't going to make you feel any better unfortunately.. we like to blame our mood on our surroundings but really, and I mean this coming from myself as an example; the bad mood is within you, not around you. Maybe you are going off into the woods as a suicide attempt, but it isn't going to be a soothing end, it will be very brutal and most likely you will be completely immobilized by exhaustion and then you will literally be eaten asshole first while you are alive.

Most other organs can be eaten (heart,liver,pancreas, tongue, brains and various others.)\nYou can cook the bigger pieces of meat over fire or boil them. The benefits of boiling is you get to drink the broth which contains the juices that would otherwise be lost in cooking over an open fire.\nBoiling also allows you to get nutrients from bones as well.",

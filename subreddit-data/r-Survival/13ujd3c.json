They make the CAT tourniquets for the US Military and use quality versions for the other components as well. \n\nFor beginners I definitely think it\u2019s worth getting a comprehensive kit like this from a quality source and customizing it as needed. \n\nAlso, as far training goes, Stop The Bleed courses are often free or pretty inexpensive and are a great starting point. They go over using tourniquets and packing wounds, including a hands on component with dummies. \n\nhttps://www.stopthebleed.org",

You don\u2019t need to worry about losing a limb from a tourniquet unless it\u2019s been on for a very very long time. They are the norm and are carried on every ambulance I\u2019ve ever worked on. Quikclot and compression bandages on the other hand, are not always stocked as they aren\u2019t deemed necessary.",

For him, a small nick in the skin can bleed for several days straight, but with a tiny bit of the powder applied, it stops within a minute. We had a plumber cut himself at the house last year and offered it to him, he loved it and said he was going to pick more up on his way home. I recently read a story on here by someone who had a chainsaw accident and applied it while waiting for the ambulance. He attributed his survival to it, saying the EMTs couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t bled to death before they arrived, based on the severity of his injury (he couldn\u2019t believe it either). Military and law enforcement both use it\u2014I believe they prefer the gauze. \n\nEvery situation is different, depending on the person and location/nature of injury. It won\u2019t be the right tool for every situation, and should be combined with other measures. Of course, first-aid training is going to always be the most useful tool. Any time you react poorly to a medicine, it\u2019s probably wise to avoid it going forward.",

Personally I find that a regular dressing works just aswell in the majority of circumstances, granted I haven\u2019t had to use either that many times so my opinion is off of a few anecdotal experiences. When it comes to someone with a low clotting factor such as your family member they can most definitely be useful, but for massive hemorrhaging such as the chainsaw story, a tourniquet would be better and if one isn\u2019t available simply packing the wound works wonders as well. \n\nHemostatic agents also increase the risk of infection, can damage your vessels, and can increase the risk of a blood clot that can travel and cause further damage.",

If it's deep you're going to seal on contaminants and there will be a space under the skin that almost certainly will become infected. Better to use some butterfly bandages and accept the scar. Or if you're in some remote location, your sat phone won't get a signal and the helicopter won't he out for a month to pick you up, you're better off packing it with gauze and changing it once or twice a day to bmbasically let it heal from the inside out.",

The adhesive seals the wound and it keeps tight like butterflies but it's even across the board which causes less scarring and there's less opportunity for infection because it's completely sealed off provided you cleaned it properly first of course.",

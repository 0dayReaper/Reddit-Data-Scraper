    "postText": "I've spent the last three years living off the grid, practicing survival, bushcraft and homesteading skills. \n\nMy understanding of a useful blade has changed a lot. \n\nI use to to love taticool blades. Things that I thought some special forces unit would actually use. And manufacturers know that stuff sell and they know their buyers don't actually use their knives. \n\nLook at the two blades above. \n\nOne is a \"Bowie\" knife I made for a friend out of a tramontina machete. No true collector would call that a Bowie knife. \n\nAnd the ka-bar raider Bowie clearly looks like a Bowie and looks much more capable. \n\nBut I ask, what would James Bowie actually choose between the two?\n\nWell, I took the ka-bar raider out for a day hike. And you know what it's good for?\n\nReally nothing except chopping and splitting wood. It wasn't good as a knife at all. Might as well bring an axe instead. \n\nIts blade geometry is too wedge shaped so it can't cut. It's too heavy to carry comfortably. It's too short to bushwack. Too large to do fine wood working. \n\nAnd to be blunt, too heavy and poorly balanced to be a fighting blade. I'm not an expert but look at historical examples. They don't look like the raider Bowie. \n\nThe thing is basically a sharpen crow bar and I've never needed a sharpen crowbar in a survival situation. I've needed a knife which this is not. \n\nThe tramontina bowie on the other hand.\n\nAt first glance, it looks too thin. But people have been using these machetes for heavy duty bushwhacking for decades. So obviously it can take abuse.\n\nIn terms of it being a large knife: it's comfortable to carry. Just long enough to do bushwhacking. Thin and sharp enough to cut well through thick vines, small trees, or even to be used a draw knife. It chops okay and can be used to take down medium-small trees in a pinch. \n\nIt's only weakness is batonning through wood. Which is a fair trade off for the weight and blade geometry. \n\nIn terms of fighting? If two twins were fighting, and one had the raider and the other the tramontina. I would put money on the tramontina everytime. That's how much of a mismatch they are. The raider sluggishly moves into position. The tramontina has more reach, better penetration, and \"points\" super naturally. It quickly becomes an extension of your arm. \n\nSo I ask again. In a survival situation or a depe woods situation, what would James Bowie choose?",

Turning it into a Bowie makes it more difficult to \"chop\" through vines, but changing the bevel allows it to \"slice\" through vines. So it's a less effective machete, but a better all around knife. \n\nIn this case, the Bowie was made for a friend who is really short and small statured, and wanted a machete that fit their body, yet also a van knife if they get attacked while van camping. So it was worth the trade off.",

Its like being a firefighter because you read the side of the extinguisher can.  It's a civilian course for people that want basic classes on first aid and chest compressions.  Saying you're an EMT when completing this is actually saying you're the same as being the same as any nursing home staff is trained in.  They aren't EMTs either.  Its saying you have CPR training, and that's it.",

Maybe your state has more stringent rules, but in most states an EMT basic is the minimum certification for driving a med unit.\n\n In my case, I'm paired up with paramedic who does the actual care. And when I was doing my clinicals, I was doing it in a system that had \"basic\" and advance ambulances.\n\nThe basic ambulance got sent to all the boo-boo calls. And the advance had paramedics and got sent to the actual calls. \n\nI wish that every ambulance was filled with paramedic but that's super expensive and most ems services are going to cut cost by running emt-b's. \n\nAnd yeah kinda on the basic skills stuff. What do you think an ambulance actually does? Like even paramedics are super limited on what they can do. If you're lucky, they can give medication to mitigate damage, but in most cases, even extreme cases, the most they can do is stabilize and transport. \n\nLike a doctor goes to school for 10-14 years. A emt-b for 2-6 months depending on program. A paramedic for 1-2 years. They don't let ambulances, even ones with paramedics, do very much.",

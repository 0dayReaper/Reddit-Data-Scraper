            "comment": "So, if you had literally nothing else, and you were very skilled at using both a knife and a hatchet, having it might outweigh the benefit of not carrying the extra weight.\n\nGernerally speaking, something that is both a hatchet and a knife is not very good at being either.  Generally, things that are two things are not very good at being either.  Unless you're talking about, like, duck tape.\n\nEdit: For those of you in the back of the class or who are just arriving:  Duck tape is so named because it was originally made from duck cloth.  The one application duck tape is useless for is taping ductwork because it is a fire hazard and quickly becomes dry and brittle under those conditions.  \"Duct tape\" has been accepted into common parlance.  So, you are not wrong if you say \"duct tape,\" it just doesn't make any sense.  Additional comments erroneously correcting \"duck\" to \"duct\" are unnecessary.  Evidence linked below.",

It's easier to carry and it's more versatile. Sure I can't cut down a large tree with a knife but in most survival situations you don't need to(I say with a bk9 you can cut down a tree about 6in wide no problem). Not to mention it's at least $100 cheaper. If you hike long distances, an axe of any size gets annoying fast(and let's be honest, if shit hits the fan you won't be able to use your bugout vehicle for long). In the end, it's nice to have both but if you are trying to acquire other things at the moment, a good knife or machete is good enough. \n\nFor the OP: I personally think you have the best of both in that tool. The most important thing is to actually go out and use your gear. That is much more important than having a ton of things you don't use or need.",

If you are running around in the Pacific Northwest woodlands... you can get away with just a 4 to 5 inch knife especially if you have the skillset and have practice at doing so.\n\nHowever for mid-winter or anywhere you need to process large amounts of firewood you'll want an Axe if you accept the wisdom of Canadian Les \"Survivorman\" Stroud... and I do. He always preaches looking to the local wisdom and would always change up his gear based on where he was... which makes all kinds of sense to me.\n\nI honestly believe the \"best tool\" depends very much on location. A person skilled with a big knife can do alot... but put that person in a Jungle and he'd still prefer some variation of a Machete. (Golok, Parang, Bolo, etc...) which you choose would depend on what you've been exposed to or are most comfortable with... but something relatively longish and light weight would allow you to swing it for longer and more comfortably while cutting a trail.\n\nI completely agree that you need to get out and use your gear... as that's how you figure out what works for you wherever you are and develop confidence in your skills so that when SHTF you aren't second guessing yourself.",

And if all you need to do is cut a piece of string or something it's fine.  But if actually have to use a leatherman for serious cutting, your hands will blister to the point of bleeding from gripping the sharp metal edges of the leatherman. And a blister in the woods is 100x worse than a blister at home. Carve a spoon with your leatherman and you'll see what I mean.",

You aren't gonna get terribly far with a 3\"inch blade/saw.. ( this also from the perspective of a PNW fall/winter/spring.)",

It's the real frontier knife. \n\nThey're great quality for the price and super modifiable. Personally I like to reshape the handle using an angle grinder and some files, but you have to be kinda skilled with the angle grinder or it'll be super easy to take off too much and fuck it up. Generally I thin the handle, cut in a notch with space for 2 fingers, leave a hump as a guard for slipping up to the blade, then round/smooth everything. Here's a pic: https://imgur.com/a/UZeiVVi\n\nThat one's a vintage one I picked up like... 15 years ago. It has prettier wood than what you'll find on current old hickory but everything else is the same. I usually just use it for actual butchering, yard work, splitting up kindling, and every once in a while I take it out to the woods. Personally I wouldn't pick the \"hop knife\" over the regular ones because they're thinner than I'd like. But people have used these for more actual bushcrafting and butchering in north america than pretty much any other knife (save for like stone axes or whatever before European arrival).",

Everything else aside about this knife, ask yourself: when are you likely to carry it aside from maybe a hunting/camping trip? Personally I wouldn't even bring this knife camping and at best, would live in my car.\n\nTo me, a survival knife is something you can edc so it's with you when the unexpected happens.  Something like a kukri or a machete can be a great blade for camping like situations, but even with those, since you aren't likely to edc them, wouldn't make the best survival knife imo unless you get yourself into a survival situation where you happen to have it on you.  \n\nI would look into something like a morakniv and a multi tool",

With that being said they are fairly hefty (roughly 500g for the machete and 700g with sheath) and expensive (90usd).\n\nAs noted the weight is close to the grip which makes it manuverable but relatively poor for the intent of wood splitting.  The saw is just better than a cheap machete or knife but not great overall.  The weird lack of point and overall head shape make it fairly awkward as a knife and as a machete.\n\nBasic butcher knife or a Mora craftsman or companion are decent budge knives that are usually between 8-20usd and usually are only 100-150g.\n\nYou can also find small pocket multitool with pliers that could fill the extremely niche need for turning bolts like on the machete for about 10usd and usually are less than 100g.\n\nA pocket chainsaw is about 200g and 10-30usd.  These are better than wiresaws and can still be mounted to a brach to act as a bowsaw.  All of which are better than trying to use the back serrations.\n\nThough I'd just skip the saw and go straight for a cheapo hatchet.  You can find fiberglass handle ones weighing between 500-900g and for less than 20usd.  A bit heavier than the taiga, but a lot more practical overall.",

This thing is the definition of unwieldy and you will cut the fuck outa yourself if you try to do hand crafts with it. \n\nIt can be used as short machete + saw combo.

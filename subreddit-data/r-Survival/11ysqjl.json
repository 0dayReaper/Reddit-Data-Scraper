Of course in extreme hot weather, dehydration and loss of electrolytes *can* lead to severe cramping, fatigue, confusion and weakness in as little as 24 hours depending on how much you're physically exerting yourself. So still serious, but not quite as serious as cold weather. The cold will always kill you much more quickly than heat will. And escaping heat, for the most part, is as simple as finding shade or stopping to let yourself cool off. Escaping cold on the other hand requires leg work. Insulated clothing, insulated shelter and fire. Plus cold just gets colder at night, so you never really find relief. With heat at least you have *some* relief after sunset. \n\nSo yeah I'd say, with maybe some exceptions, that surviving in extreme heat is less problematic than surviving in extreme cold.",

As someone who lives in a hot climate - it can be minutes.\n\nAlso the \"confusion\" always sets in first. Often you won't even recognise that something is wrong everything will be \"fine\" until you lose consciousness. Which is not a good thing if there's nobody to call a helicopter to get you to hospital right f'ing now.\n\nWhenever there's a heat wave, even a fairly mild one, there is always a spike in fatalities and that's not people in a survival situation either.\n\n&gt; escaping heat, for the most part, is as simple as finding shade or stopping to let yourself cool off\n\nYeah no - it's not that simple. When it's really hot you need active cooling, such as a large amount of water being continuously evaporated and sweat won't do the job \u2014 because you can sweat up to half a gallon per hour and if you drink half a gallon per hour (remember, it's only safe to drink about an eighth of a gallon per hour - drinking more can kill you). Sweating is at best a temporary relief - long term it's actively harmful and humans who have genetically evolved in hot conditions don't tend to sweat much even in extreme heat.",

We\u2019re talking about humanity as a whole. Maybe don\u2019t call me \u201cson\u201d though lol. A hundred thousand years is a long time but it\u2019s not enough time for humans to evolve to adapt to colder climates as well as we are to hotter ones, like in Africa. The fact we are able to live in nearly any environment is a testament to the anomaly of human evolutionary development into intention over physical capability in *general*. An animal most adapted to the climate of Africa if they put their mind to it is able to live in a frozen wasteland if they intend to do so enough. There\u2019s a good chance in the future of humanity even after we\u2019re obliterated by climate change or nuclear war or whatever, that eventually humans will become a space faring race. That doesn\u2019t mean humans are most adapted to space, but particular individuals can be. Humans have undergone rapid evolutionary changes in adaptation to environments such as higher hung capacities or fairer skin or different body hair etc, but it pales in comparison to the amount of already made human evolutionary adaptation to the climates of Africa which predate what we call humans even.",

Things like hair and skin are literally surface level... people from Africa still need to avoid the worst heat, and people living in the Arctic still need to protect themselves from the cold.",

Dig a hole in the snow, get some branches, etc.\n\nSleeping bags and warm clothes work by trapping air that has been warmed up by being in contact with your body. There are plenty of other ways to trap air.\n\nAnd of course, you can also light a fire.\n\nWater is basically the only way to cool down in extreme heat. And there tends to not be any water when it's extremely hot - because if there was water it probably wouldn't be hot (trees, for example, draw water out of the ground and expose it to sunlight evaporating the water, which cools down the air around the tree significantly).\n\nIt mostly only gets hot in deserts for a reason. Look at a sattelite photo of Australia for example, the entire continent is mostly deserts, but everywhere there's water there's thick forests, and it's far far cooler, sometimes even cold, under those trees, even though they have exactly the same amount of sunlight/heat energy hitting them.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded at the Daintree Rainforest was 39C/101F and that was an extremely unusual heat wave, it normally peaks around 32C/90F.\n\nCompare that to the Oodnadatta desert in southern central Australia (which is about a thousand miles closer to the south pole) where they have recorded 51C/123F and even in mid winter it can get reach the typical summer high temperatures seen in the Daintree.\n\nAnd by the way that 123F temperature was recorded in well insulated shade. The surface temperature if you put something in the sun would have been orders of magnitude hotter. Even just the inside of a house would probably have been hotter, because your roof would be a few hundred degrees and radiating heat down into the rooms.",

Also, they did not have access to the knowledge and resources needed to build warm shelters or to create warm clothing. Without these adaptations, early humans were at a extreme disadvantage when it came to surviving in cold environments. And harsh winters would have made it difficult to find food. Food sources become scarce or unavailable during the winter months. This would have made it difficult to survive without a reliable source of food\n\nSo humans tended to settle in regions that were more hospitable and offered a reliable source of food and other resources. It wasn't until much later that humans were able to successfully adapt to colder climates.",

Your hands don't work well in the cold, you burn 2x the calories to warm up than cool down, and if you can't make a fire, enjoy your slow, shivering death.\n\nIn the heat, you can lay down and do nothing until the temps dip later in the day without burning many calories and without needing a fire to ensure your survival.  If you find a water source, you can also use that to cool down, making survival pretty darn easy in comparison. \n\nIn the cold, the sun can still roast you, water freezes (double the reason needing a fire), and the temps can be so low that even getting a fire going is far more difficult.  If you find liquid water, don't fall in or you're dead.  \n\nObviously there's environments that are barren and hot or cold that are simply insanely difficult to survive in due to lack of resources, but for every other biome that has resources, pick hot over cold 100% of the time.",

Is there water because if there is water then you can survive and you will get use to the heat. \nI trained desert survival down by Yuma AZ summer time and sure the first week was rough but after your body gets acclimated and you learn what not to do you can survive without food only water and some shade for weeks or even a month depending on again your health.\nI did cold weather snow survival in Northern Idaho where we made shelter using the snow.\nBut sure there is plenty of water available but it's frozen and requires fuel and physical energy to get it and use it.\nYou need a lot of calorie intake in cold survival situations because if you don't your body will freeze and you will die a lot faster.\nSo from both of these situations I will take desert over 100\u00b0 F to tundra or forest constantly below 30\u00b0 F!\nOf course there is food in the desert and water can be found with a few basic things.\nWinter survival you need more to survive that's for sure.",

            "comment": "My two cents. I've lived and slept countless nights in temps ranging from 120 during day, to -50 below (F).Classic answer to a lot of survival related questions, \"It depends\". Imagine you are a northern Alaskan local with a snowmobile, going out on a recon trip for caribou. You have everything you need, and your body is adjusted to the climate (yes, it is a thing. Your blood vessels actually change slowly over a couple days to properly deal with hot or cold). A night with a snowmobile broken down would be no problem provided you have an emergency kit prepared for just this issue. On the other hand, say you are a fighter pilot and have to eject over an extreme arctic region. You are not acclimatized, and have a 1 man life raft and a parachute canopy. Even as smart to pack a couple snacks in your flight suit. Those poor fellows have no more than a day to sit in their life raft inflated, seal it, and wrap yourself around the entire parachute. Really freakin depends man.\n\nOn the other hand, extreme heat conditions. I have personally noticed that the cold overall is more physically uncomfortable and frightening than the hot environments. I spend a week in the deserts of southwestern America in Arizona. I noticed that the heat is misleading. I had some impressive, and to this day some of the most intriguing and incredible hallucinations from the heat. I spent 10 hours without water, purposely to give good ol' dehydration a shot for a real survival experience. It was hard, desperate at times but the heat oozes you to a half sleep almost. A curious feeling of comfort and lethargy. Finding water in the desert is hard, even peeing into a hole with sagebrush, and covered with plastic only yielded a cup of water. Unlike in the arctic being surrounded by frozen water.\n\nBottom line is, pack well, and know how to use your equipment to the absolute maximum. Desert: Water and dehydration is hard. Good amount of things to snack on. Barren arctic: Water easy, if you continuously melt with external heat or body heat (container within clothing layers). Food, very difficult. \n\nBoth these climates are oddly similar in fulfilling survival needs. Water and food seems to be a common difficulty in my experience. Shelter is an absolute must to protect from such extreme conditions. In the cold: A couple feet of snow around you, with a trench inside dug to let the coldest air settle inside, and placing your sleep spot above so will give you the warmest shelter. Push ups, flutter kicks and short runs during chilly periods do great to warm you up. Don't hesitate to rack them out. Bring you temp up to just below sweat. In the heat, a cave or large rock overhang will protect the best from massive heat conditions. If not, dig down and place multiple layers of fabric material above you to vent heat out. It still gets very hot on the surface and any wind will blow that heat in right on your face. Stay as hydrated as possible and just chill out during the day, let your improvised water collection systems run, and stay out of the sun. Night owls excel in the desert to do all your work. lol. \n\nAs always, LOVE Les Stroud. Ive talked to him a handful of times. Great guy, so so passionate about survival and experiential training. Watch his stuff, he posted it all on YouTube during Covid to save us. Ha. There is hands down nothing to get to know hunger, dehydration, overheating, and being frightened by extreme cold. Go out and have fun, lol.",

It depends on the individual, that's why humans (and many other species) are so successful in different climates, we adapt quickly as individuals and/or through epigenetics (a type of evolution which happens on a couple of generations). \n\nGive me ice over sun any day, but I won't claim that heat is \"worse\"",

The reason we aren't more hairy (in some cases) or can't photosynthesize is mostly down to the fact that your maternal grandmother was a human (hope you don't mind second person perspective). When your mother was conceived, she developed all the egg cells she'll have including you, when she was an embryo, so the hormonal experience of your grandmother at this time played the largest part in deciding which genes are turned on or off, think of it as which operating system should the hardware ship with. The male contribution occurs at the time of conception, but after this (specifically some time in the 3rd month) the experience of your mother added further to the epigenetic instructions which join your DNA, the analogy might be, what software do you come pre loaded with.\n\nOne example of this is skin colour, we all have the DNA to be both white and black, my white hormonal response to increased UV light is to turn on more of the melanin producing genes getting a (light) tan, some of this preference would be passed to my children, and after 100 generations or so my white ancestors would have black skin. No \"survival of the fittest\" needed fortunately.\n\nA more dramatic example is the Dutch Hunger Winter, a wartime induced starvation which had a powerful effect on the babies conceived and gestated at this time. Various metabolic conditions emerged in response to being born to a low calorie existence, which later proved detrimental in the high calorie post war world, as this cohort developed diabetes and cholesterol problems at a much higher rate than their siblings.\n\nAnd.... That's enough science geeking for me. Have a nice day.",

If you look at population graphs pre air conditioning, you\u2019ll see the south was very sparsely populated. If Arizona ran out of electricity, it would soon run out of water. Just real talk, people in the south have a fairly weak constitution when it comes to weather.",

So in the heat, a person has the time to seek/fabricate a shelter, while in the cold the person would most likely perish before being able to find or fabricate a shelter.",

It is easier to store perishable food in the cold, plus there are also less bugs, poisonous animals and disease not to mention parasites and shit in the water.

Granted getting set up initially in cold is much harder as you need to worry about staying warm on top of just food, water and shelter.",

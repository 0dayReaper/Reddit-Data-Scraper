All excess energy goes into the transition between liquid and gas states. At sea level, water gets to 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F) and doesn\u2019t exceed that. That temperature drops off with elevation, and at a certain point it\u2019s below the heat needed to kill harmful microorganisms.\n\nThe idea that the motion from boiling allows water to heat up faster than normal is the opposite of what happens in reality.

Because of this water will boil at room temperature if you put it under vacuum.\n\n\nThis same property is also why you shouldn't ever open the radiator cap in your car while the engine is hot. As the pressure in you cooling system increases it raises the boiling temperature of the water and antifreeze mixture in the system, and allows the water to stay a liquid at higher temperatures without turning into less-useful steam. When you're driving the water in your cooling system is often well above normal boiling temperature of 100\u00b0c, but doesn't boil because of the higher pressure. As soon as you open the radiator cap that pressure is released and the over 100\u00b0c water flashes into steam and burns your face as it escapes\n\n\nFucking LOL how the actual real facts are being downvoted vs someone pretending to know what they're talking about spreading false information.

We didn't know they had portable filters, but we would call pretty often because I was 13 and had a hard time with the mountain topography. When we would stop to cook food we would just boil a lot of extra water and fill jugs. Only issue was the increase in weight at the beginning of each day but overall it wasn't too bad. After the trip we did get a filter though.",

At least in terms of covering miles. You need to be doing 10 miles a day to start and gradually work up to 18 - 25 per day in order to complete it in good time. In my short time on there I did like 4 days, each day over ten miles. 7 miles a day would be for someone in absolutely terrible shape, or maybe they want to enjoy every flower and bush on the way. Hike your own hike and all, but at the end of the day you have to make miles if you have limited time and a plan.",

So just a PSA to folks in general, please be careful and treat your water unless you are absolutely certain that you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nWhen I\u2019m camping, I always boil all my water even when I\u2019m really confident that it\u2019s clean because it\u2019s easy and isn\u2019t inconvenient, so I figure that even if there\u2019s only a .01% chance of the water being tainted, I can eliminate that chance by taking 60 seconds to stick a pot by my fire.\n\nI understand that long distance hiking is different and I don\u2019t do much of that myself, so I\u2019m not going to comment.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re in a true survival situation and you can\u2019t find a way to boil or treat the water then you should obviously drink the cleanest water you can find before you die from dehydration.",

Cryptosporidium causes some significant symptoms that could potentially kill a weakened person.  \n\n\nSo keep that image of violent shitting in mind. It is just a sip away!",

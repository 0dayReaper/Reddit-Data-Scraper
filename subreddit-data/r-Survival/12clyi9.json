    "postText": "Stimpack is a reference to the post apocalyptic video game, Fallout.  It's an open world survival game that has drugs in it one of which is a \"stimpack.\"  It's brings your wellness and energy level back.  Obviously if I take a hunter's arrow to the knee, a stimpack wont work in real life.  I'm talking more of an energy mood and sense of well being kit. Is this a thing?  What's in yours?\n\nMy stimpack is Part of the complete first aid kit. includes a shot of pre-workout aminos (weight lifters take it), instant coffee (deathwish or starbucks), Moroccan hashish, Prednisone (corticosteroid), Dark chocolate, and a lighter.",

            "comment": "Keep a big pill fob with several days worth of meds just in case. These are mostly anxiety meds and meds that keep me calm, plus some actual strong painkillers legally in case I really need them. I never know what could go wrong or if there is like or horrible storm and I'm completely screwed. Also this way at work I never have to leave my duties to go take meds as I got some spare on me.    \nAside from that when I get really exhausted and weak after busting as for a long time I need a snack. Not sugared foods or anything. Protein. I need protein. Eggs, protein shake, nuts. I keep those in my small personal backpack/bag I bring everywhere with me. It also has my Powerade mix which I prefer to be quite diluted with water, some premixed Powerade. Antacids/tums, Ibuprofen and acetaminophen, kratom(it helps with pain, just don't take too much or you will get sick), ecig juice and kit, a few spare knives, a sewing kit with needles and threading and fishing line, a spare battery pack for my phone or mp3 player large enough to charge both about 3 or 4 times fully from one full charge, nasal spray, vitamin c, and lastly my m&amp;p shield 9mm and extra mags. While I work I stow it away in a lock box though. Sadly if I needed it I have to jog a block to go get it but that's ok.     \nSo yeah that's what I carry with me just in case. Sometimes I carry an MRE in my bag too if I have one to spare in case I need a full meal in a 24 hour period.",

(No, I don't mean kill yourself if you run out of coffee) it is actually not hard to quit caffeine. You should not cold turkey it, but it's pretty easy to taper it. I have gone from a pot a day to no coffee in a few days, multiple times.\n\nThe strategy is like this: a) you have to want to stop, b) drink no coffee on the first day until you start to feel negative consequences of withdrawal. In my experience, the residual effects from drinking it the prior day will keep you from actually experiencing harsh withdrawal symptoms for most of the day. You might be irritable, but things like a bad headache don't set in for most of the day and hit near dinner time.\n\n At this point, allow yourself a \"maintenance dose\" of no more than one cup of coffee. Or even half a cup is enough, it will take the edge off. That's coming from a pot a day habit. Half a cup of coffee (or literally one cup in liquid messurement terms.. who drinks literally one measured cup of coffee though? To me, a \"cup of coffee\" is a mug full, or about 2 cups in measurement terms.) --so one liquid measure cup of coffee, is enough to take away a headache and tension that would otherwise prevent you from being able to relax due to withdrawal. Then you can get to sleep that night. (Counter intuitive, a cup of coffee in the evening when you have a pot a day habit is a \"hair of the dog\" type solution, not enough to really stimulate you or keep you awake.)\n\nThe next day will be even easier. Go as long as you can before you drink any. I often dont need any coffee the second day.. the one maintenance dose on the first day's eve is enough to step me down, and I can cold turkey it the rest of the way. Mileage may vary. If so, repeat pattern with smaller maintenance doses until you're clear.",

I've kind of given up on defending the whole legitimacy and impact of ADD/ADHD and why these meds are prescribed. \n\nPeople are going to use them no matter what. At the end of the day it's just speed. It's going to benefit virtually anyone who takes it, so the confirmation bias is through the roof, even within the ADHD subs. So many people have it prescribed and then when it helps them improve their focus or productivity they just assume they must have a condition worthy of taking it. \n\nIdk. Sorry for the rant lol. Just kind of annoyed by the whole shortage and what not due to over prescription.",

They aren't specific to pre-workout (I take them 1-2 times a day, neither of which are that close to my workouts), and not all pre-workout has aminos.  Aminos are essentially protein without the calories.  \n\nThey are used in the fitness world to keep your body in hypertrophy, without necessarily taking in calories.  While it could help with some muscle soreness and maintaining muscle mass (slightly), since in a survival scenario, you likely won't be exercising for fitness AND likely won't have the excess calories to maintain, it just doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nYou will likely not be getting in electrolytes and minerals in, at the same rate you would have, pre survival situation.  Electrolytes or multivitamins can fill these deficiencies, and provide boosts in energy without a crash.",

Sometimes, due to bad weather or time constraints, or lack of fuel, I don't want to make a cup of coffee in the morning and take a caffeine pill instead to avoid a migraine from caffeine withdrawal later.\n\nI have severe allergies, and have a legit prescription for prednisone. When backpacking, there's been times I've had to start taking it due to really bad hay fever/allergic reaction to pollen to a point where i had a blinding headache &amp; no energy whatsoever. Also cetirizine &amp; benadryl, taken morning and evening, same issue. (Unfortunately, the doctor who prescribed the prednisone and trusted me to take it safely PRN-- reasonable amount, correct taper -- retired. I need to find someone else who understands that 'stay inside with the AC on and never go outside' is not a reasonable solution, especially for someone like me who loves outdoor activities. Or I may just need to get a passport sorted out and start getting it in Mexico again.)\n\nFor situations where I have to be awake and alert but don't want to be jittery later, cinnamon hard candies. I've used cinnamon to stay awake when sitting in a blind for photography or hunting.  If I was worried about people rather than animals, I might skip the cinnamon. Humans can smell cinnamon quicker than they can smell other people. (For animals, it doesn't really matter -- if they're downwind of you they're going to smell you, with or without cinnamon in the mix.)",

That way I could go from 10pm to 2am and get to sleep by 3am so I could function before 10am the next day. Now, I also never drink coffee, don\u2019t drink alcohol daily, so I get the most out of each substance. \n\nIf I\u2019m fading at 12:30am, I do 550mg of theobromine.

Still you won't burn that fat until the carbs are dealt with. breaking down carbs requires energy in and of itself that could be better used for survival compared to say freeze dried beef. Beef fat's melting point is your body's temperature. It's readily available energy that (unlike sugar which is the ultimate product of carbohydrate and starch) lasts all day.  Meat is what gave us energy to grow grains for our slaves and livestock and to paint bison on cave walls.",

These are a great substitute for Adderall if you're suffering from brain fog, or if you're just looking for some mental clarity as opposed to speed/energy. Though it does a good job at both. \n\n3. Kratom.  Great with caffeine. It's basically powdered optimism with some analgesic properties. (It is addictive) But think of it as like a cleaner, non-dopey feeling Percocet. \n\n4. Adderall, of course. But I mean, if it's the end of the world or something serious then just use meth? Prob more sustainable anyway. Either way it should be used sparingly lol. \n\n5. Taurine supplements. These.. work? I don't ever notice a huge bump in energy but something is there. I take them alongside L-Tyrosine or L-Theanine. \n\nIdk. I have ADHD so any uppers really just make me feel normal, or at ease. I don't get antsy or overly energetic so I use all of these (aside from meth lol) and usually feel at the top of my game. \n\nThese are all easily concealed without taking up much room in whatever pack you throw together.",

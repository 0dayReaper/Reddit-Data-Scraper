                    "comment": "&gt;Questions:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Would hydrochloric acid from a car battery be a viable substitute?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Could you mix a little Calcium Hypochlorite or Potassium Permanganate with antifreeze or brake fluid Polyethylene Glycol? Then maybe add a couple drops of water or battery a or to speed up the reaction?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Last, is potassium permanganate the stuff mixed with aluminum powder to make some m-80 type fireworks?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It\u2019s been 10yrs since chemistry class, I\u2019m really curious what reacts with what to keep a random cat from knocking over some containers and burning down my shed.\n\n1. No and car battery acid is usually sulfuric, not hydrochloric.  Unless you really know what you're doing don't mess with it.   Its really good at fucking people up.\n\nEDIT:  should clarify the first point,  YES sulfuric acid will likely react with them to burn your shed down, hydrochloric acid won't but will make chlorine gas which will really suck and potentially kill you.  Same with hydrochloric acid and any hypochlorite.  \n\n1. Yes.  Should work for both.\n2. no, that's potassium perchlorate which much like potassium chlorate is a pretty good oxidizer and explosive and while they will oxidize things won't really do it fast enough to start a fire.  Realistically they're both good at making explosives, but aren't really going to light a fire (unless you add very specific chemicals like sulfuric acid to potassium chlorate)",

            "comment": "Neither.  It's single use only and heavy in large amounts.  With a ferro rod you basically get infinite fire for almost no weight.  It'd probably be less weight and longer use to carry a 10 pack of bic lighters or just one lighter and some fuel.  Plus both of them are hazardous on their own so not really worth messing with.  There's better light weight reusable water purification and better antiseptics. Why waste all that space and weight in a bag for something so limited in use?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't use either on wounds or drinking water, though especially not the potassium permanganate.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSealed well both should be pretty shelf stable.  I've used potassium permanganate that was 10+ years old just sealed in a plastic bottle with a loose fitting lid.  No issues.",

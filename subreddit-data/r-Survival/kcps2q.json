And although I could have gone to college, I chose instead to save up a small nest egg, mostly doing wilderness therapy work with troubled teens, then bought land at 21, moved into a tent and built a passive solar stone and log home on a shoestring budget. Therefore, I\u2019ve never paid rent or a home mortgage and never worked a to 5 jobs, but rather strived to eliminate expenses so I didn\u2019t need regular employment I raised four kids on a near poverty-level income, yet never suffered because we had few expenses so we had tons of freedom: \n\nhttp://dirtcheapbuilder.com",

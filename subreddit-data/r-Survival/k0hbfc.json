It doesn\u2019t matter how hard I try to point out that\u2019s not what I meant, people will insist on turning it into that. The comment wasn\u2019t even intrinsically directed at you, I said \u201cI\u2019ll never understand why people...\u201d. Of course there was no way I could know your relationship with alcohol. I\u2019ll admit I was taking an educated guess but I purposely didn\u2019t specify you. The comment itself just made me think of a certain type of people. I hear people they say they\u2019re alcoholics all the time and in my head I just think \u201cshut up Karen you just like getting pissed\u201d.\n\nI suppose what constitutes a problem from person to person can vary. But my definition of alcoholism is a dependency, despite it no longer wielding any recreational benefits or otherwise. If you like having a drink too much and do it a little too often then in my mind your probably part of the broader majority, not an alcoholic. Drinking vodka when you wake up because you can\u2019t bare the idea of not being drunk for a second is dependency. I haven\u2019t had a drink for nearly a year now. I\u2019m doing really well so I\u2019ve got no reason to be bitter or anything honestly. I was literally just saying how in my head it sounds stupid when people say that sometimes, but hey that\u2019s just my opinion. I wish you all the best in tackling your drinking problem my friend.",

For me I wouldn\u2019t use it to describe drinking too often I\u2019d use it to describe someone who drinks 24 hours a day and develops physical dependency. Meaning you get ill when you stop. It really doesn\u2019t bother me how people wanna use the word though that\u2019s just my take on it. Which is why I said I\u2019ll  never understand why people use the word in that way.

If you have an old device with storage left I'd recommend downloading these apps. I use the play store but just search offline survival guide/manual/medical. Fare warning, if you get bit by a snake or find yourself cold... you don't wanna start researching. When traveling I'll bring both phones and spend my down time learning how to use the apps and how to find information quickly that I don't naturally retain. (My fav app is offline survival manual by ligi)",

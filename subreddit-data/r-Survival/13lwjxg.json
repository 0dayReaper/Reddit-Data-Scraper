    "postText": "The Manchineel tree fruit has the moniker \"little apple of death\" and is in the Guinness World Book of records as the most toxic fruit on the planet. I ate one and think these accounts are somewhat exaggerated (at least when it comes to the fruit).  I opened this post to describe my experience (which was still certainly unpleasant and to be avoided).\n\nI was on a beach in NW Costa Rica and stumbled upon what i later learned was the manchineel tree fruit. I saw an iguana next to me eating the fruit and became curious so picked one up, smelled it, took a small bite, tasted it, found it was sweet, and ate the flesh of the entire fruit (spitting out the large pit). (I know this was dumb, just opening this post to describe my resulting experiemce).\n\nMy symptoms progressed as follows:\n\n0-3 hours: mild swelling of mouth and throat with small lump in throat forming after ~1.5 hrs noticeable when swallowing but not particularly painful, after which all symptoms to mouth/throat subsided. (No effect on breathing.)\n1.5 - 48 hours: mild stomach tightness and soreness. There were stretches where the stomach pain approached moderate. \n2 - 36 hours: initially had mild diarrhea that soon graduated into severe diarrhea that lasted on and off for much of the next day and a half (with sensation of moderate sphincter burning at some points when pooping).\n\nThe worst part of this encounter was definitely the diarrhea. It wasn't soo bad that we were stuck at home but we had to stay within 5 mins of a bathroom. The experience was certainly uncomfortable and I learned my lesson about eating fruit that I hadn't positively ID'd (Something I'd been cavalier about my whole life until this point)\n\nTreatment:\n\nAfter eating, my mouth and throat became slightly swollen with a mild cottony feel and subtle almost bile taste. I didn't think much of it and thought maybe I was having a mild allergic reaction (though I don't have any allergies). I pulled out my phone and ID'd it as the Manchineel tree (distribution, fruit and tree characteristics, and photos all matched, also it turns out the striped iguana tends to hang out by and can digest the fruit). At this point I went to the closest urgent care. (I did not take any medication at this time as google said I should first see a doctor).\n\nIt was perhaps ~2 hours after consumption when I eventually saw a doctor. Neither the urgent care desk staffer or my doctor were familiar with the fruit. My symptoms were so mild that my doctor (after googling the fruit himself) was very skeptical that I had actually ingested it. I assured him that I had positively ID'd it but he didn't seem convinced (should have taken more photos, the ones I have were taken after the fact when I went back to the tree). I suggested active charcoal for poisoning and he didn't seem familiar (or I may have misinterpreted his reaction and he just didn't think it was a good idea because he didn't think I was actually poisoned). He said he thought I was fine to go and to just come back in if things got worse. \n\nI left and diarrhea set on. I was still able to eat, though in smaller portions. I started taking peptobismal and being sure to drink lots of fluids but did not feel a follow-up visit was warranted.\n\nIt could just be the case that I had a uniquely mild reaction or higher tolerance to the fruit (I am also in good health). However the local urgent care's lack of familiarity with it (the trees are common along the NW coast of Costa Rica where I was) makes me think the severity described online may be somewhat overstated; otherwise I would have figured they would have had more experience treating individuals who had ingested it and had more severe reactions.",

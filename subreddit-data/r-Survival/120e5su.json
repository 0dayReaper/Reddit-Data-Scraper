I also remember him saying to suppress the shockwave you have to get on the ground cover your ears and open your mouth. \n\nWatching the Beirut videos reminded me of it because apparently not a single person knows wtf a shockwave is and just sits there filming while it approaches and blows the hell out of everything LOL.\n\nI cannot find a single thing about it online and I\u2019m starting to think it was all a fever dream.",

Nobody tried to say \"hey I managed to get all the way out in BFE without a car or plane or donkey caravan helping me.\" No medical assistance, etc. Nobody did that. Bear was presented with scenarios in which to demonstrate techniques or knowledge, usually dealing with getting out of the danger zone. Les usually set up shop and waited for the bailout. The physical difference between the two was obvious.  Bear was a physical machine whom the camera guys could barely keep up with. He often did things most couch survivors couldn't physically do. His approach was all SAS commando. Les took a slightly more Canadian- mellow approach.  Both had value. I feel personally Bear was a wise cracker as many Brits are, having that oh so British humor, especially those guys in special air service, all serious wise asses.Les was well...less so.",

Les Stroud did have a rescue crew on standby but they were normally many miles away.  He was provided with a satellite phone to contact them if there was a medical emergency.  All of Les Stroud's survival was done on his own as well as the filming.  There was nobody nearby to assist him or to provide him with food and water.",

Not really sure why you would need passive television education when you could choose a topic and become an expert depending on your personal drive. \n\nFrankly, considering all of this discussion is post-YouTube it seems valuable to get people interested so that they can do their own research later pout about how ignorant the successful TV show host is. \n\nI'm sorry entertainment sells I guess. Discovery etc.  were never PBS. Shark Week has been going on since 1988 and it's just JAWS rehashed repeatedly with some marked negative effects on public education and perception. \n\nI understand the Les Stroud boner and I agree he's significantly better but you folks are a bit much.",

The particles themselves may only move in straight lines, but dust is carried on the wind, on clothes, on skin. It can be breathed in and swirled around, and it can navigate corners with a little help from the air pressure.\n\nYou need to cover your entire body, no gaps for dust to get in, and wear a mask to filter it out as well. When you get back to your hidey hole, you need to very carefully remove your clothing and leave it aside so you dont bring the irradiated dust inside. Wash your whole body afterward to get off any dust that may have come off your clothes. The dust/ash sticking to you is what's going to keep the radioactive particles shooting into your skin.\n\nYou also need to have a shelter where you can seal cracks and such so dust doesn't blow in.",

It is planed out and checked by a crew before hand but he does at least tell you what the better option is (even when he doesn\u2019t choose it) and gives general information and details like it taking however much longer, there being unknown aspects of it, etc. The reason he chooses to do the option that could very much kill you instantly or at least lead to it much faster is mainly because it draws in more viewers. Same as many of the shows out there. I doubt any of that is new information but the way I see it is, even if he was just selling out, would it have got half as many people watching it as it did if he had taken the slow and safe route instead? Definitely not. At least by drawing in such a large audience there were people (perhaps inadvertently) taught their options of what to do in risky situations. When really in the shit I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to choose the options Bear didn\u2019t take. It don\u2019t take long being stranded for all that extra \u201coh I could do that\u201d confidence to die off. So in the end I think his stuff is a good thing if you look at it like that. It\u2019s also because of him that the whole survival thing took off and got people interested in other more legit shows and survivalists out there. So I can easily laugh at it but I just can\u2019t hate on it all that much. I would like to think it did more good than bad in the end. I also think his skills are legit just that the show is exactly that. A show.",

            "comment": "The show I liked most in that genre was Survivorman, with Les Stroud. It was a lot more like watching what the average person, without gear, would have to do and endure to survive. \n\nHe put himself in positions even he did not like, and he had the same feelings about it that I would. Good morale is hard to maintain under extreme hardship, but that\u2019s when you need it most, and Les was very transparent in his struggles to maintain it.\n\nI learned a lot more from him, including what it\u2019s like to spend a night alone in the wilderness, unable to see what\u2019s crawling up your arm. I will always carry with me what he said about survival. It all depends on what you\u2019re willing to do. Or eat.",

It was on a steep incline vacant few acres and we took branches and rocks and make a fort with several rooms and levels.  That thing stayed there for a decade!  I mean the wood rotted and disappeared for the most part but the rock walls and dug out floors remained until it was finally cleared and built on.  \n\nMan those days were awesome.",

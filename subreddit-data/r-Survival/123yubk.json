            "comment": "I prefer the saw in a survival situation!\n\nEfficiency: A saw is often more efficient than an axe for cutting through smaller pieces of wood. A saw's serrated teeth can cut through wood quickly and with less effort than an axe, which requires more physical strength and can burn more calories when using.\n\nPrecision: A saw is more precise than an axe and can make smoother, more accurate cuts. This can be important for tasks such as carving or making intricate cuts for a shelter or other wooden object.\n\nSafety: A saw can be safer to use than an axe in certain situations. Axes can be dangerous to use if you are not experienced or skilled with them, and they can cause serious injury if used improperly. A saw, on the other hand, is generally safer to use and less likely to cause injury if used correctly.\n\nLightweight: A saw is often lighter and more portable than an axe, which can be an advantage if you need to carry your tools with you for an extended period. A lightweight saw can be easier to carry and can save you energy in the long run.\n\nVersatility: A saw is a more versatile tool than an axe and can be used for a wider range of tasks, such as cutting through metal, plastic, or bone. This can be important in a survival situation where you may need to improvise and use your tools for multiple purposes.",

About $60, IIRC.\n\nGet the curved blade version.  It saves effort.  It'll chew through a 5 inch diameter log in a few seconds, the trick is to not put much pressure on it and let the saw do most of the work.  The teeth only cut on the back stroke, and don't cut when you push forward.  It clears out sawdust so the blade doesn't bind, and consistently cutting in one direction versus two is more efficient due to how the wood behaves.  The blade also locks open in two positions; the \"normal\" position, and then a second one where the blade locks at an upward angle from the handle.  This is for sawing logs that are very close to the ground.  You can hold your hand in a more natural position and still be sawing parallel to the ground instead of pointing the blade down into the dirt.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I don't work for Silky in any capacity.  I just really loved mine(Some asshole stole it out of my tent).  It is the Mora Garberg of survival saws.",

                    "comment": "Wait.... a saw is more efficient than an axe for small wood? How small? Cause like... 15 sec of sawing vs one well aimed axe stroke seems in favor of the axe.\n\nI also disagree on versatility. A hatchet can fell, delimb, buck, and split wood of course. As can a saw. For bucking I give it to the saw vs a light weight hatchet for being slightly more efficient. Hatchets can carve wood too, personally I do 90% of my carving with a hatchet/axe. But now lets talk about the rest. A GOOD hatchet with a proper sharp edge can easily do most knife jobs. IE skin, process meat, clean fish, cut plastic, cordage, food prep, etc. You can totally use an axe to cut bone, as it is after all an impact tool. Personally I'd say the \"metal cutting\" point you made is moot because the kind of saw you'd carry into the woods would be ass when used on metal and in fact the axe would be better there too unless you had a hacksaw blade as well. It would be foolish to even use a good saw on metal which would then ruin its cutting edge which would be much harder to maintain than that of a hatchet. The only limiting factor is the length of the head making it unwieldy in tight spaces. A hatchet, given that you chose well for your area, can also be used for clearing out light vegetation. Finally... a hatchet can be a weapon. \n\nOverall you have solid points on safety, light weight, and skill requirement. But what you pay for in the above you gain in actual versatility.\n\nThe true answer here is both, use and carry both.",

It doubles as a hammer. Can be used as a fire steel, and is also is always a weapon for hunting or self defense. \n\nSaw can cut and thats it really it. Kind of a Uni-tasker in my mind. An absolutely great tool but only really good at one thing, cutting.",

            "comment": "FWIW, I'm a pretty experienced backpacker -- been doing this since the 80s, in some fairly remote areas. Got a different take on survival.\n\nI'm planning a two week, solo, no resupply, off-trail trip in May. I'll be taking about 75% of the food I need (will make up the other 25% with crawdads and fish, or go hungry -- not expecting to go hungry), very minimal gear because even 75% of 2 weeks of food is heavy, and I'll be route finding through super remote country without any trail. But, I'll also be camping 2-3 days at a time next to nice fishing holes and relaxing.\n\nNot taking a hatchet or a saw. At all. Don't need it.\n\nIf I need a fire, I can find enough down wood for it, or break off good sized boxwood branches (super brittle) by hand.\n\nFor shelter? I've got a 1 person tent, an air mattress, and a dridown quilt. The tent in question is a Kelty Salida, it's six years old, has several months of trail time on it, and still looks new. Buy quality gear, be willing to carry a little more weight than an ultralight backpacker, and your gear will last literal years. I've had that tent through howling winds, rain, snow, hail, you name it. Buy quality.\n\nOne of the spots I'll stay at has what I refer to as the \"Bear Grylls Fort.\" Some very industrious person built a ginormous (and illegal) bushcraft shelter. There's a table, chairs, benches, a lean to, six foot walls, a floor made of flat rocks, and the biggest fire pit you've ever seen in your life, etc. It gets added to and maintained regularly by someone(s) though I haven't run into them yet. Every time I stay there (it's on National Forest land next to the best fishing hole for miles, so yeah, I'm camping there if nobody else is!), I pitch a tent -- I *could* stay in the nice bushcraft lean to, but it's drafty, damp, catches  smoke from the fire, and there's daddy longlegs in it by the handfuls.  And that's on a *nice* night.\n\nMy tent is comfortable, even in bad weather.\n\nThat tells me from a survival standpoint, I'll almost always be better off with a good quality tent.\n\nSo, I don't need a hatchet or saw for ... anything, really. Or a big knife. I used to carry a big hunting knife, but never, ever needed it. Just carry an opinel now, mostly for opening packages of food and gutting fish.\n\nOnly time I might take a saw (and a whacking big knife) would be in super, super, wet conditions where you'd need to split wood to get it to burn. That's fairly unusual in most parts of the country.\n\nAnyway -- my .02 from actually being out there and doing the things.",

REI has one made along the same lines, but I think it's a few ounces heavier.\n\nWatch out for the off-brand Chinese knockoffs you find on Amazon, and the cheaper brands like Coleman or Ozark Trails. Tent may look the same, but there's a high chance of it leaking, the tent failing during a bad storm, and being much heavier for very little savings.\n\nOpinions are like assholes; everyone has one. I'm sure someone may come along and say that you need the latest and greatest &lt;insert ultralight option&gt;. Tents, like anything else, are tools, and you need the right tool for the job.\n\nIf you're  concerned about getting into survival level situations, shelter is one of the top considerations. A good, solid, bombproof tent in a time-tested design, from a reputable company is a good start. That, plus a good insulated air mattress and a good sleeping bag or quilt, mean you won't necessarily need a fire.\n\nDo take a saw (and a big knife to baton wood with) if you are going to be in extremely wet conditions, or you'll be staying at very popular campsites where the smaller stuff will be picked over, and you might have to cut some bigger wood up.",

A hatchet much more so than a saw.  \nIf you\u2019re under real time pressure to get sheltered and warm or purify water you don\u2019t want to be wasting it trying to make a fire or cut timber for a shelter.  \nIn extreme weather it can be impossible to build, light and maintain a fire for any practical purpose.    \nCarry shelter, adequate insulation and either a water filter or tablets or both.   \nFor a challenge, for fun, I\u2019d use a saw over a hatchet, it wastes less wood, it\u2019s often quicker, it\u2019s much quieter and much much less likely to cause an injury.  \nFor actual real life emergency preparedness neither is the right tool.",

The folding saw gets used for tree pruning, cutting up brush, and clearing/widening trails. I've cut down cedar trees with smaller axes and it's a workout. If I'm having to cut down trees without gasoline I want an appropriate sized ax, which is probably not something you want to pack in a bug out bag. If you pick up a folding saw, I highly recommend the Silky brand. I have a Silky 240mm folding saw that kicks ass, the 180mm saws would also be good lightweight choices for a backpack. Bahco also makes a nice folding saw, and Corona is a good budget option that I ran for many years. But if I could only pick one it would be the Silky 240.",

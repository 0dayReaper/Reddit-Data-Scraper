    "postText": "I'm looking to get a good outdoor hat and was wondering, what hat would you pick if you could only have one?\n\nI plan to use it for fishing, hiking, and possibly hunting. It's main use would be against the sun but it would be nice to have it work well in the rain as well. One requirement would be light weight and something I can roll up (or make flat) and stuff in a backpack without worrying about damaging it. Also able to float. I'm not a fan of the way bucket hats look so I'm mainly thinking boonie-style hats. I'm seeing Tilley, WindRiver, and CTR hats being sold in my area. And I'd rather not go much more expensive than the Tilleys.",

It it has a fold up flap you can open to reveal ventilation mesh (close it on cold days), and a chin loop clasp that is smaller so you can stuff it inside the hat without an uncomfortable lump.\n\nBut I really do prefer my waterproof (varnished) straw hat. Bigger for more sun protection and neater/better looking. Only sacrifice is it's not foldable or durable but I'm willing to make those sacrifices most of the time.\n\nSorry I don't know the brands, I ripped off the badges on both of them years ago.\n\nWhy have one hat? I also have a third high vis hard hat for working around heavy machinery/falling trees*/etc.\n\n(* my brother is an arborist, sometimes I help out)",

I also ride with a travel fishing rod and never know when I'll run across a lake or stream and feel the urge to fish (which I've had head/face burns from a few times already). Similarly, I'll never know if I might get stranded out there in the rain and need something to keep me dry (I do have multiple survival blankets and a bivvy though). But it sounds like a deticated hat for the heat and another for the rain would give better results. I guess I could carry two but free space is already pretty tight in my riding backpack.",

I've got mine somewhere around here. Take the top layers out first, then try it on/ wear it around and see how you like it. Keep the other one for cooler days. To me, they felt cooler like that.",

UPF50+. Moisture wicking and water resistant. Snap up brim and tuck away chin strap. Also a hidden pocket to stuff some emergency cash or personal information in case lost or in an emergency. It can be a bit warm but dunk it in the water to help cool you do. \n\nAnd I'm pretty sure they still are (double check) but the wanderer is guaranteed for life against normal wear and tear, defects etc. I had heard they would even replace a registered one at least once if it was lost. I may be mistaken on that though. Either way can't go wrong with buy it for life. \n\nNote: if you do go for a Tilley make sure you check how they are supposed to fit. They fit rather large so you don't sweat as much and if it's windy the chin strap keeps it on. Not the fit.  The looser the more comfortable with these.\n\nhttps://ca.tilley.com/products/t3-wanderer-hat?variant=37139994509468",

Very lightweight at 74g / 2.6oz. Specs say it also floats, though haven't tried myself.\n\n[https://sundayafternoons.com/collections/mens-sun-hats/products/ultra-adventure-hat?variant=37929306620094](https://sundayafternoons.com/collections/mens-sun-hats/products/ultra-adventure-hat?variant=37929306620094)\n\nBought mine for hiking, but due to great sun protection it has seen lots of use in other situations too.",

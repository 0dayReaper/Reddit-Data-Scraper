            "comment": "People always ask for opinions and reviews but never state what they're planning on using the knife *for*, and *under what conditions*.\n\nKnives are designed and constructed differently because there are different uses, different climatic conditions, different ecosystems with different materials, different hand shapes and sizes, different levels of ability, different levels of dexterity, different terrains, different sets of other tools and gear....\n\nOpinels are lovely, simple, inexpensive, and well designed and well made *for what they are*. But a so-called 'wilderness survival knife' will usually be quite a bit more robust than an Opinel.\n\nThe Opinel has a finer, thinner blade than a true survival knife, and its hinge and locking mechanism won't stand up to the torsional and sideways forces a survival knife is expected to withstand.\n\nIn the words of the great Mors Kochanski, \"a survival knife is a prybar that can cut.\" You might expect a survival knife to be able to wedge into and split off wood, widen openings in tree trunks, jam into locked coolers, hack through thicket, cut through airplane fuselage, baton firewood in place of an axe, open a tin can, lever up a slab of stone, drill a hole into a fireboard, and so on. These operations don't suit the Opinel. It might accomplish some or all of them, but not reliably; and in a survival situation you could find yourself suddenly without a knife.\n\nAnd that's before we even get into other operations like hammering and crushing, which are possible when you have a tough, full tang fixed knife with a hard pommel.\n\nWhere the Opinel shines is as a general use pocket knife. It's very sharp out of the box. It will whittle (though deep carving may loosen the hinge over time), cut cordage, fashion small wood tools, fillet fish, perform food prep, and produce nice long curls on a feather stick. Many think of it as the ultimate picnic knife -- picture it slicing brie and baguette in Provence, France. The Opinel is excellent when called on to *slice*, which may cover most of your camping and hiking needs, but it shouldn't be expected to excel as a bushcraft knife and it certainly falls short as a rugged survival knife.\n\nHaving said that, the most important feature of any knife in a survival situation *is that you have it with you*, and the small to medium sized Opinels are very light and comfortable in the pocket. For that reason, you might be more inclined to always have it on your person, whereas you might get tired of lugging that big Rambo blade around, and it could therefore conceivably get left behind. Sometimes 'better than nothing' makes all the difference.\n\nAs to carbon steel versus stainless steel: both Opinel versions are excellent. In common use, there's not much to tell them apart. But u/the_hucumber is right: the carbon steel will hold a finer edge, and hold it longer, whereas the stainless steel will resist rusting when used around snow or water. Another reason why the use and conditions are vital considerations: will you be using it in The Great White North, or in marshland, or will you be spending your time in the high desert where water damage won't be much of an issue?",

Usually I don\u2019t find myself in some hardcore survival situation, I need knife for like you said some small works, like cutting food, branches, fashioning wood etc. I wanted to know how are Opinels in general.

                            "comment": "Yes for those purposes, excellent price to quality. It's one of those knives that can almost grow to be a part of you.\n\nAnother design feature I didn't mention is the rounded wooden handle. Except for edge of the open slit, which you're more or less going to have on any folding knife, it's very comfortable, and affords many different grips. You could, for instance, reverse your grip to use the knife as a draw-knife, to shave fine layers off a piece of wood, or grip it with the fingertips to do fine mincing of herbs or mushrooms.\n\nOther knives with flat-sided handles, 'grippy' synthetic scales, or specific finger grooves really only work best with one hand position, and not for all hand shapes. This is another reason Opinel is known for its versatility.\n\nAnd one other possible drawback: the twist lock requires two hands. For a folding knife in a survival situation, one-handed opening is definitely welcome, in case one hand is injured and  you need the knife to cut dressings and tape, for instance.",

Great for customization and tinkering because they\u2019re cheap and the handle is beechwood that carves well. Slice like a dream, perform \u2018surgery\u2019 style tasks efficiently, sharpen up **great** (i always put a convex edge on them with a ruby hone). The spine of either is nigh on to razor sharp so strikes a ferro rod with maximum glory, can be fitted to harbor a sawblade next to the knife for a perfect firekit tool. I carry a ss no6 thats been flattened some, charred, with a divot for ease of opening, and a hiviz reflective lanyard; I have a carbon no10 with serrations, an added 14tpi sawzall blade, and a hidden embedded 1/8\u201dx3\u201dferro rod in my personal firekit and love them both dearly. The pair of them together aint worth half the Terava Jaakarippuuko 110 i carry on my belt, but i definitely use the no6 20x more often than i draw my belt knife.",

I was still in elementary school at the time.\n\nPersonally I like opinels for carving and slicing, like a lot of actual cutting where you need a comfortable handle and good geometry (it's either that, a MAM Iberica, Civivi Lumi, or something like a stockman or whittler slipjoint). These things are true workhorses. Especially if you're doing some leather work or a crafting project, IMO simple knives can't be beat. The thin slicey geometry will spoil the shit out of you, I don't think there's many mass produced modern locking folder out there that can cut as well as an opinel. The only ones I know of is the civivi lumi and the MAM knives.\n\nPersonally I actually think Opinel's stainless is the better steel in regards to edge holding. It's heat treated harder, more wear resistant, and if you're using it in the woods for food prep or fish/game it'll stay sharper longer due to that corrosion resistance. BUT, carbon steel has nice character to it and sharpens up ridiculously easy.\n\nI've worn out and lost a few of them, but I've never broken one or anything. Just respect that its a tool, it has limitations such as a thin tip and that the lock collar can wiggle loose and you'll be fine. I've done everything short of batoning with mine and had no issue. If you really want to baton with it just keep it unlocked and bent 90 degrees which will take the stress off of the pivot, you can overcome with technique and a bit of  care. Check out felix immler and how he does 95% of his bushcraft with a swiss army knife. Throughout history people have done more with less, an opinel would be a godsend compared to nothing!",

                            "comment": "I'm sure there are a lot of people with more expertise and knowledge on the matter than me who can comment.\n\nBut I'll reiterate that *it depends on who you are, where you are, when you're there, what you're doing there, who you're with, what you know, and what you're carrying with you.*\n\nI don't know if you're traveling through jungle, in which case a well-balanced machete or duku candong (parang) for swinging all day and crafting shelters might be in order, or whether you're trekking through a Boreal softwood forest, where you might need a bucksaw, axe, and a knife that's non-brittle in extreme temperatures, has a reliable grip while wearing gloves and mittens, and offers a lanyard tie point so you don't lose it in the snow or over water.\n\nBut then, do you know how to swing a machete all day without hacking your own limbs off, and do you know how to build shelters with it? If not, then you might do better to carry a standard knife on your hip and let someone else clear passage.\n\nLikewise, do you know how to use a saw and axe to safely procure a car-sized pile of firewood for subarctic nights? If not, then knife plus shelter, alternative heating, and motorized vehicle might be safer.\n\nHow your ability (including skill, knowledge, dexterity, and fitness) interfaces with the specific conditions and activities at hand will determine what kind of design and construction would best serve you. And these are balanced out by the other gear you carry (if you know how you use it) and the expertise and reliability of your travel mates.\n\nOne thing is quite apparent on these Reddit forums: guys often buy knives that serve their self-image far more than they serve any practical need. This is often carried over into how they treat their knives and other equipment (not to mention their companions). So another feature that might come into play is indestructibility (or resistance to stupidity).\n\nGetting on to the knives themselves: I personally don't buy combat knives. I don't fear encounters, I never intend harm to others, and most of all the features that make knives appropriate for combat make them pretty bad at a lot of other tasks I'm going to want to perform. But for those who are in the military or other security work, it could be an issue -- they'd want to be able to slash and stab without their hand sliding up along the blade, for instance. Ka-Bars, SOGs, and Glocks are popular here, as well as some offerings from Cold Steel. That kind of design is a whole other discussion, but through its evolution as *the one piece of kit you absolutely have to be able to count on* the combat/military knife has helped to define what we think of as a survival knife.\n\nBut if a survival knife isn't just a massive combat knife, it also isn't just a deft little bushcraft knife. Ideally, it's:\n\n* a good enough bushcraft knife (adept at fashioning natural materials into tools and implements)   \n* a good enough hunting knife (able to field dress game, and possibly to process the non-food parts for long term use)\n* also beefy enough to take a pounding  \n* using full tang construction   \n* tough enough at the edge to resist chipping and breaking  \n* depending on the terrain, possibly long enough to cut back brush and clean up harvested saplings  \n* of a length, weight, and balance that allow for a considerable amount of chopping (under the presumption that the user may be without all other tools)\n* sharp-spined to throw sparks from a ferro rod\n* not overly burdensome or injurious to use when weak or to carry over long distances\n\nOther desirable features depend on the conditions. If you're on the coast or canoeing/kayaking a lot, you might want a rust-resistant stainless steel blade, for instance. If you're hiking, you may not want a long and heavy chunk of metal chafing and bruising you as you walk.\n\nThere are a number of good knives that cross over between genres, playing in the zones between combat, bushcraft, hunting, and specialty knives.\n\nFallkniven have excellent knives, and their A1 is a classic. Very thick and tough (laminated layers increase its resistance to abuse), with a great point and large useful belly. No nonsense. This is a good option for use around water, as it's corrosion resistant and incorporates a lanyard hole.\n\nSurvival knives for hunters might include the Esee 5P and the smaller Spyderco Bill Moran.\n\nIf you don't need a particularly long knife, the Benchmade Bushcrafter 162 beefs up the typical bushcraft design with a thicker blade, excellent steel, and a handle that harkens back to the Becker and LMF designs, including tie-off and lanyard holes. The handle doesn't have 'affordability' (isn't adaptable to many ways of holding), but it does lock the hand in -- there's a give and take to the design.\n\nBack in the old days, a 'survival knife' among indigenous people was just a knife -- a hand-size blade that could be used adroitly for a thousand different tasks. Whatever the knife lacked in robust construction was more than made up for by the skill and knowledge of the user. A classic Finnish Puuko is the basic tool of survival for the Sami, but we consider it underbuilt. A massive Ka-Bar Becker will pry open ammo boxes or break a door away from its hinge in an urban setting, but the Puuko is perfectly adapted for use by an expert in a cold softwood forest.\n\n'Best knife' is a convergence of many different requirements and conditions.\n\nI tend to carry bushcraft knives in the wilderness and an inexpensive assisted-open folder in the city, because they suit what I use them for the most. In fact, I'm most often carrying a little 2\u00bc\" blade [Roselli Bear Claw](https://us.roselli.fi/products/bearclaw-uhc-steel), in Ultra High Carbon ('Wootz') steel: it's the most functional knife I've ever used. That little curved blade holds its edge forever and can't be beat for working with wood and small tasks around home or camp.\n\nIn northern winters, I use the [Knives of Alaska Bush Camp Knife](https://www.knivesofalaska.com/Store/bush-camp/bush-camp-knife---suregrip). I don't love the design, but it has an utterly non-slip grip when wearing bulky mittens, the D2 steel and heat treatment make it very resilient against chipping in the cold, and I do have it on a wrist lanyard. I guess this is the closest thing to a survival knife in my cabinet.",

No bigger than hand size, with a rounded wooden grip that allowed for multiple hand positions, a metal pommel, and a skandi-ground carbon steel blade that offered a curve practically throughout its entire length. It was a full-tang construction with lashing holes in the handle. He later upgraded the blade to include a hole a bit back of the point, so the knife could be nailed into a plank and used as a levered cutter for processing large amounts of material. He could use the spine to scrape a ferro rod, or pair it with a flint to strike sparks directly from the blade.\n\nThis knife (the Skookum Bush Tool) was a bit thicker than many common bushcraft knives, so it could have been used to pry things in a pinch. Mors used the sharp tip quite a bit to drill or ream holes, but I find it to be one of the weak points of the design. The more pointy angle in combination with the skandi grind leaves little steel to support the point, making it prone to breakage. But of course, Mors knew the limits of the design and materials better than anyone, and simply didn't use his tools stupidly. \n\n(He would often categorize both gear and people by distinguishing between 'Skookum', meaning *authentic, useful, dependable, true*, and 'Cheechako', which in his words,meant *\"a stupid bush idiot\".*)\n\nI had the honor to witness Mors using the knife and his other equipment. His extreme skill was deeply trained -- it was second nature. One got the impression that he could perform these tasks blindfolded. As such, due to Mors' profound knowledge and skill, *for him* his relatively small knife was a 'survival knife' -- it was pretty much all he needed to make a good living in the Northern forest. That, a large kettle, a self-made bucksaw (with extra blade worn inside the belt around the waist), perhaps an axe-head and two handles, and the right clothing were about all he needed to thrive in most conditions.\n\nMors was willing to review any knife or bushcraft/survival equipment at any hour. He'd be up at 1am, still tirelessly teaching and pointing out strengths and weaknesses of particular designs, when most of his students had long since gone to bed.",

I try to preach good judgement (via skill and experience) over extra-sturdy / overbuilt tools, following his lead.\n\nIt looks like the Skookum has a 3mm spine. I agree that that's pretty close to ideal. But many knives advertised these days are quite a bit beefier than that: \"brutish\" has moved on! The Fallkniven F1 is 4.5mm, the ESEE 5 is 6.25mm, a full 1/4 inch, as is the Becker Campanion.\n\nI think the two of us are on the same page. My only concern is that what people hear when we say \"sharpened pry bar\" these days leads them to believe that *only* these extremely thick knives are suitable for bushcraft or survival. The concept of \"the best survival knife should be thicker than your standard knife\" has drifted so far than a 3mm spine is looked down on as built for light, casual use only!",

If I am carrying a knife in a wet or sweaty environment I would consider the stainless steel, even though I do not feel that it holds an edge as well for my uses.  I regularly carry multiple pocket knives for varying tasks, some are stainless and some are carbon steel.  Also if in a survival situation you could strike a spark from carbon steel easier than stainless steel unless you are using a ferro rod which can strike off anything harder than it is.  Stainless steel is a relatively modern luxury.  I have multiple Opinels and I enjoy using each of them, regular knives and specialty knives like my pruner or my mushroom knife.  The price point makes these attractive and depending on your intended use they might be one of the knives for you.",

            "comment": "Great knives. I would opt for the stainless, and here is why:  \n\nAs other commenters have established, it's not a bushcraft/survival knife, so you will mostly cook and eat with a bit of package opening and paracord cutting on the side. Because you are out in the woods, cleaning it properly and drying it before you put it away is probably not as easy/accessible as it would be in your home kitchen.  \n\nExample: As you hike to the creek where you plan to camp, you come across many fiddleheads. You pop out your knife, casually cut them, and toss them in your forage bag as you walk, paying more attention to pace count and navigation target than the actual fiddleheads. Once you have enough, you put your knife away and keep walking.  \n\nNow sure, you've put some semi-protective patina on it. You have a canteen of water, and you carry a clean cloth. You absolutely could and probably did clean that knife and put it away without having to spend attention to it. But did you HAVE to? Isn't it nice not to NEED to?  \n\nDoes the carbone hold a sharper edge longer? Maybe. It depends on how good you are at sharpening. But you also probably carry a small fine pocket hone, a strop, or some way to touch up your knives in the woods. So does the difference in edge retention actually MATTER? The convenience of the stainless is more impactful.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: It's nice to have a small, easy-to-access, low maintenance blade on you, at all times.",

I cut them away with my opinel. The wood handle quickly swelled and was hard to open and close. It had to dry out over a few days. I had the walnut handle and stainless. That\u2019s for what it\u2019s worth. So it\u2019s not very great if it gets wet in a scenario like that. \n\nThe blade is extremely sharp and thin so it has limitations, it\u2019s not really a \u201cworking\u201d knife. The lack of a choil and a hilt make it extremely easy to cut yourself if you aren\u2019t careful. \n\nBasically, in my opinion it\u2019s a gentleman\u2019s knife that won\u2019t scare anyone in public. It\u2019s great for peeling a piece of fruit or cutting in every day light tasks. \n\nI own two opinels. One I bought a long time ago before opinels became popular and a common name. The other one I bought at REI off the shelf a few years ago. \n\nLet me say that they are a great all around knife because they are extremely light and inexpensive. You can afford to have one in every pack, vehicle, tackle box or anything else you might carry. \n\nAll my other knives are: Several spyderco salt knives, victorinox swiss army, one fallkniven full tang, a few different Moras, and a semi custom Bark River, Fox River.",

Place the value on those items and you have your individual answer. \n\nIn a survival scenario, it is not a stout blade or hinge design, so chopping of prying with it is a no no. \n\nIt does get very sharp and is easy to sharpen but loses its edge quick compared to other blades( choose your own philosophy here). \n\nIt\u2019s better than nothing, but for serious work long term, I think it lacks a lot. Buy a few and through them in a glove box for a rainy day. But for a serious work I\u2019d choose something else.",

            "comment": "Imho Opinels are very good knives for the price. But you have to know how to use them, and for survival you need a size 10 because the blade is quite thicker than a 8. I m not sure if there is a size 12? \nOpinel have their blades fully grinded so they are very easy to sharpen but the blade is very thin towards the edge. So they will cut very well but aren\u2019t good for carving for example. You can apply a lot of force cutting and driving the knife in a slashing movement ( I mean following the blade in its length-sorry for my poor english) but you might damage a size 8 if you do a carving movement where apply force in a perpendicular way to the blade.\nMy grandpa was a farmer in France and my cousin after him they always carried an Opinel, it is France\u2019s most used knife for edc. If you know how to use it you\u2019ll end up loving it. \nOne last thing: don\u2019t open it with your fingers, do \u201cle coup du savoyard\u201d grab it by the virole ( the locking ring) and tap the opposite end of the grip (on the groove side of course) against a hard surface: the blade will go out enough to open it without using the nail groove, and that\u2019s the way my grandpa always opened it (my grandpa was freaking cool!)",

            "comment": "If you go for the high carbon blade, expect it to blacken fairly quickly with use. This is not a flaw, it's normal. It can be polished back to bright reflective surface, but why would you do that. High carbon is also scary-sharp. One thoughtless moment could take a good portion of your finger off. Don't ask me how I know. But I use it all the time in the house. It is my best and sharpest knife. For the hiking backpack I have a few Opinel stainless steel knives that include other survival-oriented features, like whistles, cord cutters and fire starters.",

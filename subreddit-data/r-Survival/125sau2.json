Its usually pretty dry. \nRegular, live spanish moss is very very absorbent. Yes. I love piling the green and gray stuff around the tent, and also under a campspace spigot or otherwise, around the washing area. \n\nSo heres the thing. Even though its super absorbent, its also SUPER flammable.. it will emit a lot of smoke, really steam, and methane as well. Methane is also flammable. Dont decorate with spanish moss, lol!!! \nHowever, its always good for fire starting. No bones about it! But again, the black kind is dryer and much safer to use for fires..\n\nSpanish Moss is so flammable, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Maryland, bans it from school grounds..\n\nhttps://homeguides.sfgate.com/spanish-moss-flammable-86996.html\n\nMoss is also apparently good for wound care since it contains iodide.. and some mosses are edible!! Spanish moss takes some prep to be edible, however. \n\nhttps://www.outdoorrevival.com/adventure/great-survival-uses-moss.html",

Even if it hasn't rained for days (that's rare) the only way to start a fire is to get out of the forest \u2014 find somewhere with no trees which will allow sunlight to get through to dry things out.\n\nThe only place trees don't grow in the rainforest is on water - so... find a river or large creek and hopefully somewhere along it there's only water when it floods. You might find some dry driftwood or something. But again, only if it's in the sun all day long. And of course not in the river.",

Its simply a fast drying plant that is full of methane, and is therefore HIGHLY flammable. \n\nBtw it will simply look gray when its alive, and simply dry enough to burn. Idk if I want to recommend han\u011ding some in a tent, because its really very very flammable, but that could be a great way to get some of your spanish moss firestarters dried out, while you use your vaseline covered cotton balls, or fatwood, etc to start your initial fires.",

Possible that there are some brands that are not like this, but I wanted to mention it before you purchase any. May be worth looking it up. Otherwise, I bought a round container that sorta looks like 2 soda cans connected in the center. It was a first aid kit when I got it 15 years ago, but I turned it into a survival kit and then wrapped the outside with foil and then multiple types of fishing line, string,  wire and paracord.

Like orienteering with a paper map and compass.\n\nIt's not about surviving civil unrest or a major economic or social collapse. That's more of a /r/preppers thing.\n\nAnd even in the world of preppers there's a whole range of people. Like being prepared for a quake or natural disaster is one less extreme example, but prepping for the end of the world with 2 years worth of food in a bunker and a pile of guns is the other end of the extreme.",

I took my wife out on a camping trip a few years ago and gave her 3 hours to either set up the tent, or make a fire in the campfire area and maybe warm up some food.  She chose fire.  Gave her split wood, tinder, matches, lighter, my flint and steel, then I set up the tent. 4 hours later, had to use the inflatable mattress pump myself to make a fire after dark, and grill some fish by lamplight, and she learned a neat lesson in thinking outside the box.  She got it fine for breakfast the next day.  She just used the air pump to help her first efforts.  Lesson well learned.  I just want my wife and kids to have basic survival skills in case of a power outage for several days.  Lighting a BBQ with a Bic or flint and steel instead of lighter fluid, melting snow to have water to wash things with, or flush the toilet if the pipes are frozen and broken.  Things like that.  Plus zombies.  They are always my concern/wish.",

A container made of foil sheet is too unstable and difficult to handle on a fire to be a sensible choice for boiling in if someone\u2019s in a real emergency situation.  \nHaving to light a fire at all is several additional steps, any of which might not be possible.   \n\nSo my advice to OP is to reduce the steps, time and effort needed to obtain and sterilise water and, if they want something similar in packed size to a folded sheet of foil, carry a litre water bag and tablets.  \n\nThe other uses for foil are debatable and there are better, more reliable tools to meet each need.  \nReflecting the heat of a fire is something it can do pretty well but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth carrying a large sheet of foil just for that, unless a person knows that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ll need.

You can start a fire with a thin strip of it and a battery and some tinder. You can use it for crude repairs to electronics and make a circuit or wire. You could make shims with it to fix a telescoping walking stick or tent poles. \n\nShoot, you could probably make some shoe liners with it to keep your feet warm. Or cut some slits in a piece to make Inuit style snow goggles.",

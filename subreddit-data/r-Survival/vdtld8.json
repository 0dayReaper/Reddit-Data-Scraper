Weird way to respond when someone answers.  \n\n&gt;I like some of this guy's videos, but he often leaves important stuff out.  Tbh he comes off like he's repeating stuff he's learned from credible sources, but leaves some of the most important  information out that could protect his audience.  Back when I was WFR certified and more active in wilderness and survival communities I worked on medic teams for various outdoor skill sharing events.  Several of them would have mushroom foraging workshops and guess who got to deal with the sick folks when the instructors forgot to share all the crucial information.\n\n&gt;I don't think he should lie or be censored. I think if he's going to present himself as some sort of instructor, he should include all the pertinent information.",

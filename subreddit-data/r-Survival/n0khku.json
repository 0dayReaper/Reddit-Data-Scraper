I assume you mean the reflective mylar type and that simply isn\u2019t true.\n\nSorry to be that guy but only under specific conditions does the human body lose up to 70% of its heat via radiation, which can be reflected. Naked, indoors with no moving air currents and not in direct contact with the mylar. Outdoors a clothed person laying on and under a reflective bivvy or blanket loses most of their heat via conduction and convection and only a very small % to radiation, around 5%. Encouraging people to believe that a reflective bivvy alone is enough to keep safely warm is misleading. They need properly effective insulation both under and around them.",

The kind of lightweight reflective bivvy bag OP\u2019s referring to is widely advertised as reflecting 70% or more of body heat, which is grossly misleading. Personally I\u2019m fed up with seeing space blankets or bags promoted way beyond their capabilities to people who don\u2019t know better. In a real emergency in cold conditions hypothermia is a real danger.",

And you\u2019re not criticizing her music you\u2019re just saying it\u2019s not good, which is useless. AND this is an informative piece on hiking, why did YOU feel the need to put that little bit in there that YOU don\u2019t care for Billie\u2019s music. Maybe YOU thought \u201chey, I\u2019m going for a pretty informative little electronic pamphlet thing here but also I\u2019m trying to keep it a little fun and funny too to keep the reading interested. MAYBE, ooh this could be a good idea! People like to hike sometimes and have existential dread and listen to music. That one pop artist Billie Eilish has some pretty sad music, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually sad, I think it\u2019s not that good actually. I should tell random people people that I don\u2019t like her music.\u201d Or something like that I guess. Just seems REALLY REALLY REALLY dumb.

I think it's super useful and informative in a fun way - only minor criticism is the Billie Eilish comment - People like different music for various reasons even if they can concede to it being not so great, so throwing in that opinion kinda took me out of the informative aspect. I recognize the issue and wouldn't put it above the good info, but if the goal is to guide in a fun way it might not hit the goal throwing in \"popular musician not good\" (I know it's only a playful comment, but can also distract from the point!) Otherwise it's a super fun comic and will be passing it along to some friends and family for their summer trips!",

I am also annoyed by all the people that seem to think it's a great idea to blast whatever music they like at high volumes on Bluetooth speakers nowadays, like seriously no one wants to/needs to hear your music, keep it to yourself! I first noticed it a few years ago when visiting Washington State, and now I live here, but it seems like the trend is spreading everywhere now, what a way to ruin the peacefulness of being out in nature!",

Just below the mouth you need something flat stuck in the ground, like a flat rock or bark, so when the mouth is lowered it seals the mouth off. Throw some bait in the back of the bottle, mouse goes in the mouth, when it tries to get back out, the mouth end lowers and is sealed off. When it's at the back mouth goes up so air gets in and stays alive",

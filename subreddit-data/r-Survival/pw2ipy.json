With straight grained woods like this ash, it can be easier to split with a chopping axe just because it's easier to hit where you intend, and it takes less effort to swing.\n\nSo really, it depends on what you're splitting.",

I just happen to be amazingly good at aiming whatever it is I'm swinging whether it be a heavy maul or an axe, so the advantage of accuracy is not relevant to me personally.

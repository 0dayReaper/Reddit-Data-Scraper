    "postText": "Hey everyone. I was hoping to get some information and potentially some recommendations for usage of a giant fresnel lens to start fires.  Im looking to spend around $100-300 on a quality lens.  Im not necessarily interested in a small size, more so a lens that could rapidly achieve very high temperatures. Does anyone know where I could buy a high quality lens?  If not, can somebody expand on what specifications I should be looking for?  Thanks in advance!",

I just removed the Fresnel lens from that and polished one side so that only the magnifying lens component was left. It's about 1m^2 and sets wood on fire in seconds when held near its focal point on a sunny day.",

That's how cameras work.\nWith a small lens you don't notice it's the sun, just a small white dot of heat, and ASSUME it's focussing down to a point. But with a large lens you get a large spot of light - the sun's image!\n\nStandard concave lenses can't focus \"to a point\", it's the physics, it's not possible.\n\nA standard imaging Fresnel lens takes the \"unused\" glass from a lens, and flattens the active surface into strips of curves.\n \nA solar(non-imaging) Fresnel lens cheats - the concentric rings of chopped up lens are in fact prisms (not curved surface) that DO focus to one point at the focal length. Crap for making an image, but makes a smaller hotter spot for heating.\n\nJust a FYI.\n\nR. Winston, J. C. Mi\u00f1ano, and P. G. Ben\u00edtez, Nonimaging Optics, Academic Press, 2005.",

A fire piston is an equally strong choice but you're reliant on fragile rubber o-rings for it to work.\n\n\nKnowing how to start fire without tools is a boon. The \"best\" way depends on local climate (fire drill/plough/bow/etc). Certain slow burning fungi have also been used to transport fire to enable easier camp movement, saves some effort. And at least if you can start a fire without tools in a post apocalyptic world it means you can trade lighters to those that can't.",

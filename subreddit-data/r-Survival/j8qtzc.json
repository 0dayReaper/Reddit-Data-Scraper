I get equal results no matter what kind of configuration I use as long as I build it on top of a platform. I do three layers for the platform. Wrist sized pieces on the bottom, then a layer of finger sized pieces perpendicular, then a another layer of finger sized perpendicular to that. Then a teepee or log cabin on top. I've found that this starts the whole pile with less monitoring, leaving more time for setting up camp or maybe gathering larger logs. This method also produces a nice flat layer of coals for cooking",

I bring a small bushcraft grill, it's 6\"x9\" or so, get my bed of coals going, then lay two 6\" logs on top of the coals (keep the bark on them) far enough apart to rest the grill with a gap in-between. Then throw my steak or chicken on it. Off to the side, a small aluminum frying pan with potatoes and onions in it. I usually go with a blackened seasoning. You don't need much, but if you overdo it, it still tastes good\n\nI'm making my mouth water now....",

They're lower down and more evenly hot making them better for cooking and they produce a nice bed of coals\n\nTeepees are fast burning and bright! They're great for showy fires when you're camping and you want lots of light of that perfect picture. They also are kinda smokey--of maybe I'm doing something wrong. I have only ever built teepees for fires in a campground with lots of friends to hang out by it, not for personal cooking/heat needs\n\nLean-tos are my personal go to when I don't have much in the way of tinder &amp; kindling or if there's a constant wind coming from a certain direction because I can out the base board piece (the one everything is leaned on) against the wind to protect things as I build it up. When I'm camping or need a cooking fire fast, I do a lean-to of one log and lots of tinder and kindling, even some wrist sized pieces, and once the base board log is lit, I turn it into a log cabin. This is mostly cause I have more success lighting lean-tos probably just because I have more experience with them. \n\nI can't speak much to the other ones, but I hope this helps!",

Light the center. As the tepee burns, the outside logs will fall inward, feeding the fire. This type of fire burns well even with wet wood.\n\nLEAN-TO ( slightly different built but probably same function you can check at the wiki link) \nTo lay a lean-to fire, push a green stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle.\nPoint the end of the stick in the direction of the wind. Place some tinder deep under this lean-to stick.\nLean pieces of kindling against the lean-to stick.\nLight the tinder. As the kindling catches fire from the tinder, add more kindling.\n\nCROSS-DITCH( the star) ( slightly different built but probably same function you can check at the wiki link) \nTo use the cross-ditch method, scratch a cross about 30 centimeters (12 inches) in size in the ground. Dig the cross 7.5 centimeters (about 3 inches) deep. Put a large wad of tinder in the middle of the cross. Build a kindling pyramid above the tinder. The shallow ditch allows air to sweep under the tinder to provide a draft.\n\nPYRAMID( platform)  ( slightly different built but probably same function you can check at the wiki link)\nTo lay the pyramid fire, place two small logs or branches parallel on the ground. Place a solid layer of small logs across the parallel logs. Add three or four more layers of logs, each layer smaller than and at a right angle to the layer below it. Make a starter fire on top of the pyramid. As the starter fire burns, it will ignite the logs below it. This gives you a fire that burns downward, requiring no attention during the night.",

Feeding the fuel in slowly over time means you are in complete control if you have limited fuel, want to put the fire out quickly, or plan to be cooking for an extended time. It doesn't generate a lot of coals quickly, but it's a good way to keep a fire going. Probably started with a smaller version of one of the other methods.",

Otherwise they are great party fires.\n\nSlow burners are best for getting coals or keeping warm all night. The key here is restraining air flow once some coals are established\n\nIf you not able to cut and split wood wet days will be miserable.\n\nThe wood species, density, and condition plays a huge role.  Too detail to cover here, but if you can't id species or at least class and tell if it's green or aged your reliable sucess rate will be lower.  Generally wood that is heavy when cured and dry will have the higest btu rating.",

The initial image shows how to set up the wood, but the remaining images do not reflect the end result accurately. Would have been a good opportunity to show the outcome, e.g. size of fire, amount of coals, etc. Instead it's just a burnt version of the original image.",

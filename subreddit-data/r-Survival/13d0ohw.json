I have not shot any of these but am very experienced with archery.\n\nYou need something light, compact, and hard hitting like an Apache Bow. And you need to have everything on hand to make repairs and craft new arrows.",

Definitely fires hard, I believe mine has a 60lb draw and the bow itself feels pretty heavy in my opinion. That's about all the feedback I can give, I don't really have any real archery experience or actual training and I've never hunted with it. Also it was gifted to me.",

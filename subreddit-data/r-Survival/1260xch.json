    "postText": "Hello everyone. Forgive me if this has been covered, but I'm struggling to find what I'm after. The concept of a \"get home bag\" makes sense to me. So much so, that I EDC an unsuspicious backpack with basic supplies, and enough room to stow things I find. One thing that I don't have in there is any type of food.\nI work from my vehicle and bring enough food for a 12 hour day. I want to up that to enough *calories* for two to three days. Shelf stable. Long term. So my first though is field stripped MREs. But before I do that, I am curious what food other people have in their \"get home\" bags? \n\nThank You for your time.\n\nEdit: I want to point out one thing. A three hour drive is 3 days of walking, nonstop. On the road. So when I say I work from my truck. I could easily be three hours from home. Granted, I'd drive back, but in the worst of the worst case scenarios, I'd rather be able to sustain myself for that trek.",

                    "comment": "IMO most freeze dried food isn't ideal for a get home bag. The idea is to get home as quickly and potentianlly as stealthy as possible, so because freeze dried meals require boiling water to eat and aren't very handy for eating on the move they aren't as well suited as straight package to mouth food. Although freeze dried food has a better calorie to weight ratio on its own, having to carry a stove, fuel and extra water to eat it negates some of that benefit. Especially on shorter trips under a week or so. \n\nFor this kind of application I like first strike rations. They're very similar to MREs but contain entirely package to mouth food that doesn't need to be reconstituted or warmed to be palatable. They also weigh considerably less and take up less space than standard MREs.",

Eventually one will have to stop to replenish water and rest. This is where the dehydrated  meals come into play. Extra stove and fuel is not a concern if you have an esbit or similar type stove and use natural tinder, twigs, sticks as fuel. I get what you\u2019re saying though, and if its only a day or two hike, I\u2019d probably go without the hot meal. If it\u2019s cold or longer than 2 days, I\u2019m taking a rest and having a hot meal.",

You don't want a lot of redundancies of stuff that just isn't necessary. I say pack 1-2 quarts of water plus a disposable filter like a Lifestraw. \n\nAlso keep in mind that parasites like giardia that are common in water take 2-3 weeks to start causing symptoms. If it's an emergency and you need to get home fast, just drink whatever water you can find and deal with the consequences later. It's not worth dying of thirst because you're afraid of parasites.",

Freeze dried food will give you the longest shelf life since it has a practically zero moisture content. When you add heat and moisture, bacteria build up and cause you food to rot. Even with preservatives, they can only last so long. \n\nMaybe don\u2019t store you food in a hot car for months. It\u2019s a dumb idea unless it\u2019s freeze dried. And even then cycle the meals routinely to prevent spoilage.\n\nDon\u2019t put MREs on a pedestal as being the ultimate prepper food. It\u2019s not. Eat nothing but MREs for more than 14 days I promise you\u2019ll have constipation. I know from personal experience. Not a great day when your shit finally does come.

But that would be a good experiment. Evidently when people come upon the camps of antarctic explorers, rations more than 100+ years old are still edible.\n\nI experiment with lots of old recipes, but a good basic recipe for pemmican or Logan bread is using June Fleming\u2019s \u201cThe Well Fed Backpacker\u201c. I also like Calvin Rutstrum\u2019s old school recipes; his awesome book \u201cParadise Below Zero\u201d describes his fondness for high calorie \u201cfruitcake\u201d. This is a guy who could walk into the northern Minnesota woods, or Canadian wilds, in the fall, with a backpack and an axe, and come out in summer with a fully built cabin, thriving after over wintering and spending months alone. The food section in Cresson Kearny\u2019s \u201cnuclear war survival skills\u201d is also very educational. The food journals of Louis and Clark can be helpful too. If you want to keep things cheap and simple, have a bag of oats, some nuts, and some dried fruit (e.g.) raisins. That will get you through anything for weeks. Just add water, maybe a pinch of salt. Cold water is fine; oats don\u2019t need to be cooked.",

I have single stick pack beef jerky in the console sometimes, I forgot it for a couple years once, and consistency was like freezedried lol, but edible. It gets from 30 bellow to maybe 110 above sometimes here. I think the best idea is to go snacks that don't have icing to melt ( I do crunchy granola bars and or jerky type stuff) and rotate, you probably want more than me in the truck for sustained energy for a week or whatever. What if you get a case and keep putting a new box in the back to rotate? Then you could toss loose bars in the backpack if you need to hoof it. \n\nOn annother note, I remember driving through Washington once, and there were wild raspberry bushes all along the highway, we couldn't stand it anymore and pulled off where it was flat and stuffed our faces lol. Back home, I went with a native family once picking \"indian turnips\" in the plains. They told me the natives on reservations used to travel by foot  across the plains to US army forts to get allotments of goods from treaties, and they planted the turnips to eat on the journey. Once you knew what to look for, you could see the trail of them across the plain. They did it kinda as tradition, they braided the roots to hang in the kitchen but they are edible. My point is, what if a person could plant something wild and edible on their path ahead of time? Might work better in some situations than others of course.",

Fully saturated fats like coconut oil or hydrogenated oils dont oxidize easily, if at all, and so wont go rancid any time soon. \n\nI guess it partly depends on how frequently you intend to turn over your stock since nothing really lasts forever. I will say that freeze dried food ends up tasting like funky drier lint after a while.\n\nMy personal preference is to make a kit out of dried goods like granola (or oatmeal), powdered whole milk, honey, nuts, dried potato packets (i use idahoan cuz its cheap and easy to get), and any cheap produce i buy throughout summer and dry myself. Ill rotate out my kit, eat it and make a new one every few months. \n\nDried food saves on weight and i know that im packing food i actually want to eat.",

I live in NH, US.  So hot summer days can be 90s or sometimes 100 F.  In the winter it can be a \"high\" of below zero F during the day.  One thing I've found that survives those kinds of temps are nuts.  Peanuts are the cheapest.  But other types of nuts or mixed nuts are a good variety.\n\nBut then what allows you to store a better variety of food is a cooler.  You don't have to have ice in the cooler.  The principle is that the cooler will slow down the temp change between night and day.  Inside the cooler will remain the average temp, basically.  So then I'd add dried fruit.  Raisin are the cheapest.  Granola bars.  Candy.  Prepackage jerky.  Whatever other snacks you like.  3 days is short term, so you don't have to worry about vitamins, etc.  What you want is calories.  Not everything should be high salt.  Get unsalted nuts if you can.\n\nMREs and other perceived super survival food can be problematic.  Have you eaten it before?  If not, then how do you know that it will not make you sick?  Some of that stuff is hard to digest.  It can clog people up.  Disclaimer my medical training is zero.  For what it's worth, I believe that a person's digestive system can get used to things over time.  So if it were me, I would stick to familiar foods.  Brainstorm and think what kinds of food you often eat that would suit this purpose.",

            "comment": "Not sure what you mean by a three hour drive is a three day walk.  I can drive 180 miles in three hours and you have to be in great shape to cover 25 miles a day with a pack on back to back days. \n\nIn any case, when I\u2019ve done long hikes, like 430 miles in 26 days, I almost completely eliminated any heated meals. They waste time and they\u2019re too much effort for what you get out of them. I prefer to do things like trail mix, macadamia nuts, snack foods like chips and Cheetos, smoked cheese, summer sausage and crackers, and save the heated meals for when I\u2019m cold and need to warm up. That\u2019s usually super simple stuff like chicken bouillon, garlic mashed potatoes, or miso soup. Then I only need to carry an alcohol stove and a small bottle of multipurpose everclear for fuel (and wound care and hand cleaning and evening libation).  \n\nAfter hiking 10-12 hours the last thing I want to do is set up a stove, boil water, and wait for food to heat and hydrate. MREs suck and if you look at calories per ounce, they\u2019re heavy compared to so many other foods. Nothing beats macadamia nuts for calories per ounce for something you can eat on the move and enjoy. Cost-wise, macadamia nuts are cheaper per calorie than almost any processed food out there. They accounted for about 600 calories a day in my 2400 calorie a day diet on the trail. Trail mix made up another 900 calories a day. Beyond that, it depended on the day. Sometimes it was a clif bar, Oreo cookies, freeze dried strawberries, a ranger bar, beef jerky, and Cheetos. Sometimes it was kettle chips, mre pound cake, Quaker oatmeal bar, dried mango, and a snickers. Sometimes it was summer sausage, crackers, smoked cheese, SunChips, Lara bar, dehydrated apple slices, peanut butter crackers, and licorice. \n\nSo much less time and energy and I don\u2019t have to stop to cook. I can just keep moving.",

            "comment": "Freeze dried meals like mountain house might be preferable for taste and digestion but they need to be reconstituted with boiling water so they're not the most convenient. Military MRE's are not bad either and don't require preparation so they're a good choice. Anything from the shelf stable section at the grocery store will also work. \n\nThe closest thing to real food though is freeze dried since they're not riddled with stabilizers. Keep in mind if you're going to carry so much food you'll need water to go with it - which for 72 hours is a lot, so you might want to throw in some iodine tabs. Also 3 hours of driving is only about 1 day of walking.",

            "comment": "I once asked an Afghanistan veteran I know about MREs. He didn't have a very high opinion of them. There's much tastier food back at the base, and when you're actually out on a mission, getting shot at, there's no time to fuck around with the packaging within the packaging then waiting 20 minutes for the little heater to work, then opening your little spork and salt packet etc. The R in MRE is kind of a lie. So they just lived on granola bars and bottled water on missions. I don't do anything nearly that exciting but I keep some of those Gatorade protein bars around. Pretty filling, a little on the dense, sweet side. But fiber is for normal life, calories are what you want for emergencies.",

            "comment": "MRE's have a 5 year life span. They account for a full day's meal pack. Some are okay, while others can not be eaten without Tabasco sauce. Another way to go is dehydrated fruit and vegetables. You can eat them dry, and most are fairly good. It is cheaper to get a dehydrator and learn to do it yourself rather than buying them packaged. Be sure to have a water filtration device for each person. Extra would be recommended. Also, make sure to have iodine tablets and salt packs on hand... the tablets will aid in water purification, while salt can be used to prevent dehydration. Another item that is useful is glucose tablets. They are good for when the blood sugar drops, so if you or someone you know may have hyperglycemia. \nBe sure to make a list all food supplies in the bag along with the expiration dates of each item. They should be rotated as necessary.",

            "comment": "With MRE meals you will get the highest calorie count if you can get the ones used by the military. A full pack of military MREs tend to be a minimum of 3-4000 calories, and can be as high as 8-10000 calories. Two full packs of military MREs would easily get you through two to three days. They are a little bulky because they come in thick packaging and are full of individually packaged items.\n\nI would recommend staying away from any meals with vegetables. My experience is that the intended hot portion gets mushy and I've never had one that tasted good. Better than going hungry I guess. Beef stew type meals are fine. Alfredo spinach pasta and chicken primavera sound good but they aren't. Heating and seasoning won't fix mushy, tasteless vegetables. \n\nThe intended hot portions can be eaten straight out of the pack or you can use the hot pack and bag to heat it up without the need for a fire. Be careful with the chemical hot packs. They get very hot. I would recommend heating food outside. The smell of the hot pack inside is not good.\n\nAs a funny side bar I've heard Marines joke that the bulky, brown spoon that comes with it can be used as a weapon. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI've never had non-military MREs so I don't know what comes in the packages. Military MREs are nice in that they have a variety of incidental items like wet naps, paper napkins, toothpicks, dental floss, gum, drink mixes like iced tea or coffee, fruit punch, etc. The incidental packets vary on purpose so you can build up a small supply of handy non-food and personal care items. \n\nOne disadvantage of MREs is that they can cause mild to severe constipation unless you drink extra water. It can be an unpleasant experience. The longer you eat them the more important it is to drink extra water.\n\nAlso, as a side note, chocolate and crackers are still edible in the coldest of conditions.",

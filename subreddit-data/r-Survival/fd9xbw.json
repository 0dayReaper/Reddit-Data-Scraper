Bright blinky lights, laser pointers and such help a lot as well as very loud noise makers like whistles so you can get someone's attention that's pretty far away.",

That sounds trite; but it's a prep, and mentality, that goes a little deeper than that.\n\nLearn to use a compass, know your compass directions, how to follow them, and how to identify them if you find yourself without a compass. Know which way is out before you go in, Where's the nearest or most accessable road or civilization in an emergency or as an unplanned out, and how's the best way to get there. \n\nLet someone know where you're going and when you'll return, someone who is going to follow up on things if you don't return. One practice I believe in is I always contact the person that knows I left every time I return, they get used to you checking in and when you don't check in they may be more aware that you're missing earlier, and more motivated to contact someone. \nI always (somwhat) jokingly tell people to rely on someone that you owe money to as opposed to someone that owes you money, their motivations to get you back could differ greatly. \n\nKnow the area and the details and features of that area before you go. Learn to read a topo map and interpret the terrain you're in.\n\n\nHow to be found, as signalling/showing where you are? That's highly situationally specific. Lost hiking in the Western Maine woods is like a different planet from lost when exploring or fourwheeling in the deserts of the Soutwest.

Skills and awareness are the best tools one can have because unlike gear, they can't be broken or lost.\n\nEDIT; Link",

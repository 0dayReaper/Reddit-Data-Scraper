This concept is applied to a lot of traps because animals instinctively run forward to escape and not backward.  The tighter it gets, the more they want to run away, and the more they run, the tighter it gets.  But this trap does not allow the rat to run forward soo... The stick provides tension like a bow.  The string would have to be held just barely somehow where it first enters the funnel (before the loop of the string).  Otherwise, the loop would be pulled closed or straight and the rat could not poke its greedy face through.  Rat releases string and tension pulls the loop closed around it.",

Used the world over. \nThe bow is the machine/ mechanism that stores the tension. \nThe loop and slip knot is threaded through a gap in  the roof.\nIt's tied to a trigger  stick with a 7 knotched into it which is hooked onto the ceiling on the cage.\nThe stick baited or not and hangs down inside the loop. \nReally simple and super trap for rodents of all sizes. I've made this same trap a few times with down pipe which I cut a slot  in the top with a grinder, a flat piece of bamboo notched and a small branch for the spring.\nIt can be made as a foot snare too for other critters.",

I have never skinned an animal either or even hunted one.  Always wanted to do all of that.  I was figuring this trap out as I was typing and you're making me feel a little proud about my deductions and that much more eager to eat some campfire snake steak.",

Try looking up Shawn woods \"Tilong Bamboo Rat Trap\" he's really good and has probably 100s of videos on rat traps and how to make them. There will be others too. Hands on is the best way to learn anything.\nI used to trap possums for skins in my school years. But nowadays it's more of an interest than a hobby or a job.  Rats ,mice and Squirrels and other critters are good  for  straight out trap setting. On saying that you need an end game, as in somewhere to sell your skins, or a restaurant or buyer that will take the meat, because you don't to be wasting any of your catches or learn to cook game meats.  Then find someone local that will teach you, and there will be plenty of people who will share their knowledge and sills it's just a matter of hooking up with them.",

    "postText": "Hi. Not sure if this is allowed or not, but I couldn't find anything in the rules.  I'm writing a story about wilderness survival and wanted to have it checked for realism (as far as a fiction story can be realistic).  I was hoping the experts here would be so kind as to give some feedback so that I can adjust the story while I'm still in the earlier stages of writing.  I figured if it passes muster here, it'll do well in the rest of the world. Here is the Google Doc link for the story.  You can comment there or reply here.  Either is fine with me.  \n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubf3etXtyWs3yreYMOfK6wA6MoM79Ht3J5v8VzpkW0g/edit?usp=sharing",

            "comment": "Some typos, \n\nOpening with the x gf narrative felt rushed, also felt a little fake... Her being mad at him for lying I get but being mad at him for his job... Didn't feel it. YouTube channels make decent money and if they can afford the flights and helicopter and on site filming insurance she'd be fine with it.\n\nSpend some more time on entry to India, there needs to be more contrast between the bustling city/airport etc vs where they end up\n\nSwitch the pilot to an Indian (they would have rented through a local charter and a local pilot would have been a requirement)\n\nAdd or substitute an Indian guide who provides the rifles (it's not like tv where people can travel to another sovereign nation and have guns just like that) but hiring a guide who has the proper license is kosher. Reference is Sec10 of the Arms Act 1959 and Rule 32 of Arms Rules 1962 for India \n\nUnlikely insurance would require rifles be present. But they might require a local guide or an insured guide agency, support team etc.\n\nArmy vets are anything but unemployable... LOTS of marketable skills... Might want to do some research. In fact, it's the opposite to what you put in the story. In general you'd have more marketable skills than you would have survival skills. They don't really teach the kind of survival skills your talking about (bushcraft) in the army... \n\nOpening segments of the story paint a pic of the main protagonist as being a survivalist and then suddenly after the crash he's questioning his ability? If he ISNT skilled and this is a coming of age or stepping up story put that into the pre crash segments to give us some back story so were worried about him before he even goes to India... Suddenly his girlfriend has a valid point. Maybe he almost DIED in death valley and she told him to stop...\n\nHelicopter crash...\nWe strap EVERYTHING down, nothing would move but you have stuff floating in the air.\n\nHelicopters autorotate (you need trees or other obstructions to explain why even a catastrophic would result in what you have as a crash)... See comment above about local pilot and a charter. See film 6 days 7 knights with Harrison ford's entrance. He's working on the plane and it's broken... Add something like that when they meet the pilot and now you've added a reason for equipment failure \n\nI'll read more later",

This just happens to be a story that includes profanity since the characters speak and think with profanity included. That will turn some people off of what I write, which is okay. Not everything is for everyone. Thank you for that website. That's actually a great resource for finding alternate words when I need them.",

This won't just be sad for me, it'll hurt your sales. A lot.\n\nI'm fine with profanity. But I want to be able to listen to a book while my kid is in the car. And I don't know if you have kids, but there are things they just can't handle at certain ages. For my kid right now that's swearing, and chocolate easter eggs (we just learned that the hard way...)",

I'm just trying to tell a story that's lived in my head for years, and the language the characters use is authentic to how some people speak. \n\nI actually have three kids, all under 15.  They love to read, so I vet the books we give them. If I'm not sure, I look up samples and reviews to see what kind of content the books have. Because certain language and content isn't okay for them yet. \n\nSo I should clarify that when I say it's okay that some people will be turned off of what I write, what I mean is that given the choice between telling the most authentic version of the story while getting fewer sales or compromising the story to make more money, I'd prefer the former.",

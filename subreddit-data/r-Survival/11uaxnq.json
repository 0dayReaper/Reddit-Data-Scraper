If you get proficient with locking snare setups you can actually use the 3/32\u201d cable for larger animals up to smaller cougars. I would recommend that for squirrels try some deadfall traps as snares don\u2019t work so well for an animal as agile as them, and deadfalls cost nothing to make.\n\nEdit: I STRONGLY urge you to take a trapping course to learn. You will learn what\u2019s legal and efficient. There are some offered online. Just search \u201cTrapper Education Kalkomey\u201d.",

            "comment": "Braided picture wire is my go to. Cheap and easy to find in the hardware section of any of the big box stores. Boil it in baking soda water to dull. It's easier to show than it is to describe but I make my squirrel snares about 18\" in length. Small stick about 1/8 in diameter, last 1 1/2 to 2\" of wire wrap once around the stick, twist once then fold it back over and twist the remaining end around the main length of wire. What it should look like is a folded over figure eight. You can make multiple snares on one stick. To use snap off a section of stick freeing the snare eye, pass the main snare wire through the eye that you created to make the loop. For a squirrel the snare loop needs to be about the size of a golf ball \"two fingers in size and two fingers in height\" rabbit is about three fingers. I've caught most of my squirrels using leaning poles or suspended over logs laying on the ground. Rabbits over trails with small sticks stuck in the ground like a fence to guide them into the snare. For squirrels and cottontails you can get away with pretty light wire and small loops, for snowshoe hares you're going to want to go with a heavier wire with a bigger loop slightly higher off the ground.",

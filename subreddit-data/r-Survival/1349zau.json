I remember my dad had one that took like 8 or 12 AA batteries.\n\nThere are better choices for radios these days, but the question should be asked: What are you planning on doing with it? Signalling outside emergency services for help? Communications within a group? What's the terrain like? Are there repeaters in the area? How much weight allowance do you have and how much do you expect to use it?\n\nThose answers will better define the problem. If OP is looking for short-distance, lightweight radios that would be used in a small group for relatively close distances, I'd recommend FRS or GMRS radios. If looking for longer communications, I'd recommend getting a ham radio license and learning how to use repeaters. But that has a little bit of a training / time commitment.",

Since we lived in the woods, when I wanted to go play with my friend, who lived about 8 miles away through densely wooded mountains, we'd use CB to do the \"can they come out and play?\" with the parents. Looking back as an adult now, I'm sure we amused and annoyed a fair share of truckers in the area, when they relayed our messages back and forth for us like a game of telephone. Most seemed to get a kick out of it. I don't recall any getting upset with us.\n\nBTW, my handle was \"Silly Filly\" and my friend was \"Little Bear\". I once got the wrong friend to come visit because the relaying trucker asked if \"Bear Cub\" wanted to come play. Imagine my surprise when a completely different friend showed up on their bike instead of the one I thought was coming! We still had fun.\n\nOur little CB had a car battery powering it, and I would struggle even today to carry the CB and battery we had in a pack unless I left out other important stuff to make room for it.\n\nEta: Jason and Vicky, if you happen to read this, I miss you guys!",

With a small vehicle mounted antenna, somewhere between 2 and 10 miles.\n\nThese days HF or UHF radio are normally used (CB is in between those two). HF can bounce off the atmosphere (in the right conditions) allowing very long range communications (tens of thousands of miles). UHF is much shorter rage than CB but that's often a good thing. There's often too many people talking over the top of you with longer range systems.",

It is important to understand how to program and use these radios, and what frequencies you're going to be using to communicate. You can't just pick it up and 'call' someone, you have to be on the same frequency as the party or parties you're trying to contact.\n\nThey take very little power, batteries last a long time, and unlike satellite radio or cell phone are not dependent on functioning network infrastructure to operate.\n\nBut also it depends on what your context for survival is.

A power amplifier (kicker) helps with CB signal output but not receiving. For survival radio's I look into Ham or other Shortwave/Ship to Shore units.",

    "postText": "Hi folks! \n\nLast year, a shrew made an uninvited appearance in my camp and chewed on some of my gear. Luckily, I woke up before it made any serious damage. \n\nI've read about placing motion sensor lights, and spraying peppermint oil around your tent, shelter, car, or on your tires and engine (in you are car camping) to keep rodents far away from you. But I'm not sure if any of these would actually work. \n\nI'm hesitant to try spraying peppermint oil around my camp because I'm afraid it will attract bears.\nAnd I'm not sold on carrying motion sensor lights to the backcountry... for car camping, yeah sure  no problem, I'd give it a try....\n\nSo...any bushcraft, outdoorsy knowledge, tips or advice to keep rodents far away from my camp? \n\nThank you! \n\nPs: I always keep my food far away from my camp, or inside bins when I'm car camping.",

I keep all my food inside two layers of smell proof bags and then inside my Ursack both when in my bag and when hanging. I'll also keep any trash I'm packing out in there. Same caution can apply to other smellables.\n\nThey can also be attracted to salt. I learned this the hard way when I fell asleep with a pair of dirty socks sitting outside my tent on my shoes. They liked that enough to nibble holes through it. Never had any issue with dirty clothes inside my tent though.",

Most animals and bears included want nothing to do with you, unless what you have is easy for them to get. I have been living in the coconino Nat forest for some months now and the only problem I have is if I leave dirty dishes on the ground and the mice/whatever cleans them at night and shits in them. \n\nI also have a dog and dog food with me. \n\nSometimes you may just be picking a location that is a rodent family home. I've done this and nothing is more annoying than listening to mice chew all night long. Just be aware of where you set camp and what wild foods are in the area. \n\nPeace, stay vigilant out there.",

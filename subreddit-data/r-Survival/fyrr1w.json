Found out Filson does mostly parrafin.\n\nBeeswax gives a little pliability while parrafin extra stiffness and character to the clothing item. I made a mix of about 60% Beeswax to 40% parrafin, melted it down in a double boiler, and then cut it with half of the overall volume in mineral spirits. I tried turpentine and boiled linseed oil (the old Bob Smalser recipe with pine tar from the internet in the 90's if anyone remembers that) My wife would let me within 10 feet of the house with the first test garment. Smelled very pungent.\n\nSo I cut out all the extras and went straight for the mineral spirits. Thins it out and when it all cools its like a thick paste. Then you can use gloved hands to hand spread it, use a toothbrush to get into folds and seams then finish it off with the heat gun.\n\nAfter a couple days hanging looks and works great! Just remember to do it in a ventilated area when heating the paste up. Evaporating mineral spirits can't be good for you. Lol!",

We do a lot of \"teaching\" in high school, but almost none of it is with the intent or scope of teaching kids how to get through the most common aspects of life. \n\nIt was shocking to get to college and see how many 18 year old \"adults\" didn't know how to do laundry, or that their dishwasher doesn't actually wash the food off the dishes. Let alone more important things like what the effects of over using credit actually does and the negative effects of constantly buying new cars on payments before you pay off the last one. \n\nThese life skills should be an emphasis of school, not a luxury advantage for kids with good parents.",

We'd cook a simple meal, do the laundry, learned about chemicals when cleaning, cleaning schedules, organizing, basic sewing, and so much more. It was optional but there was always a full class. There was also Career &amp; life management which was (still is) mandatory to graduate. It taught about banking, leasing, taxes, rights &amp; responsibilities, grocery shopping, budgeting, etc",

But it seems that many of these same adults don\u2019t make an effort to learn, expecting that someone will come along an fix it for them, after all how do you think they made it this far without learning, but when all you need to do is look it up on your phone/public computer, call a parent, or ask a friend it makes it very hard to take these people seriously. A schools primary goal is to teach students the basics in math, science, etc. but it is up to you to choose elective classes. Most schools provide classes such as home economics and food nutrition which give students the necessary skills that they will need. For example, food nutrition will teach students the difference between healthy foods and bad food, how to measure ingredients, how to cook without burning your food and lastly how to wash dishes. It simply takes a bit of initiative and fighting the urge to take the class with the easy A. Learning how to manage your money is a much more complicated skill. Because you need to learn how save, and how to distribute your money based on your income and living within your means but once you learn everything else comes easy. In conclusion I believe that if you have a phone with internet you have no right to complain about not knowing how to do something, you have the ultimate tool in you hand your simple not using it correctly. So if anyone is reading this and doesn\u2019t know how to do something as basic as cook and egg or something equivalent to that, take a good look at yourself and grow the hell up. You bunch morons. (Not specifically talking about you op but if the shoe fit)",

            "comment": "Lots of misunderstanding on how sound works in terms of marketing. There are two very important factors to how far off you will hear a whistle. The first is the one you can do absolutely nothing about. That is the inverse square law. To save you a long winded explanation, every doubling of distance from where that 120db was observed, the SPL will decrease by 6db. So depending on how far away the manufacturer observed that claimed 120db will have a huge effect on how far that whistle can be heard. If they are recording 120db at the source, that's not going to be a loud whistle, even tho their claim is factual. \n\nThe other big factor is the pitch (Hz) of the whistle. In short, the lower the Hz, the further that sound will travel. So why not just make a whistle as low as possible? Well the lower the Hz, the more energy is needed to amplify it. This is why subwoofers are the largest speakers and require the most amplification. So there needs to be a sweet spot between ease of loudness and desired pitch. Especially when the lung power of a person in a survival situation is the source of amplification. \n\nSo unless a company is very transparent about their loudness claims, it can be very easy to be misleading. \n\nAfter all is said and done, the standard Fox 40 has saved countless lives. Not because it's the best at being heard at great distances, but because it's cheap and works. The whistle you have when you need a whistle is going to be the best there is.",

This suggests to me that the maximum distance is only a little over these.   \nAnd this will be under ideal conditions, without a wind blowing in the wrong direction and with low background noise levels.   \nCharts I\u2019ve seen for the range of 120 db alarm sounders show that for the alarm to be clearly heard above normal background noise (such as traffic or wind through trees), the range is reduced to 100m.   \nSo don\u2019t rely on a whistle attracting attention except at short range, unless you\u2019re lucky with the conditions.",

If I go off a road and get trapped, a whistle might just be enough for someone to find me.\n\nIf you want to talk about risk, look up fat tail risks. Probability is low, but the consequence is so high that some mitigation is warranted. Keeping a lightweight whistle with good performance (from my research, the best performance) within reach is a small price to pay. \n\nFor hiking I carry a personal locator beacon, phone, battery charger with solar and multiple light sources (including an LED road flare which will blink for hours), so I'm not relying on the whistle, but it just might be the difference.",

I assume this is with fingers.\n\nWeird that this seems like an Italian game... Anyway\n\nFox 40 classic claims 115 dB.\nFox 40 sonic blast claims 120 dB.\nStorm whistle has various results up to 132 dB, however in lab conditions it peaked out at 120 dB\n\nSo it's actually possible for a human to outperform the best human powered whistles! Not the result I was expecting. As someone who can't whistle with fingers since smashing my front teeth catching scaffolding shackles I'm happy that I can buy a fox 40 for a few dinari.",

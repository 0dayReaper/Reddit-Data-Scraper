Even radioactive particles and heavy metals in water can largely be removed by distilling. Chemicals are a much more difficult problem, especially since you might have a soup of nasty things in there. Even gasoline which when pure has a boiling point lower than water, has many other chemicals inside. Cleaning a toxic soup of chemicals can be difficult to impossible in the field with no way to prove it is clean. Even nuclear water could be tested with a Geiger counter",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, Im not a person actively interested in survival, however my stubborn brother is. He likes hiking, camping and saliling. I am a bit worried because hes very optimistic and tends to diminish risks. So I am looking for reccomendations of a personal GPS tracker that could ping his location at sea or in the wilderness to help with any search and rescue that might be needed, especially for sailing since he can be at sea for up to 72 hours with his team, and while the boat has gps and they thether themselves to it at night, falling overboard or a wreckage is always a risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm not sure if this is the correct community but I was hoping on any reccomendations of GPS trackers you might know-. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all",

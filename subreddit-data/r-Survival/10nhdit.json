            "comment": "This is my personal survival kit that I take with me when I travel and go into the woods. It is inspired by the survival kits that the US military would issue aviators during WW2 and Vietnam. It is large enough to hold everything that I think I will need if I find myself spending a couple nights unexpectedly in the wilderness or if I got into a situation while traveling abroad. But also small enough to fit in my jeans back pocket, hardshell jacket pocket, or a small backpack or vest pocket. It contains both wilderness and urban survival items as you will see as you scroll through the images. \n\nTo begin, the container was custom made to suit my size requirements while also providing a suitable container to boil water, make a shallow soup, and protect the contents within. The material is food grade aluminum and was created from a Trangia large mess tin. The container is two pans press fitted together with a seam in the middle. The seam is sealed with two layers of 3M 8979N nuclear grade duct tape (not even kidding about the nuclear grade thing) and then both sides of the duct tape seams are sealed with several wraps of 3M electrical tape. Not only does this seal the contents of the container from water, it also provides extra tape that can be used to repair items or used as a visual marker. The red piece of tape on the top is a pull tab to make retrieving the kit from a bag easier. \n\nAdditionally on the outside of the container is a laminated contents list and a Velcro cord wrap to keep the container closed after removing the tape on the outside.\n\nYou can see the amount of tape that is wrapped around the container to provide a water tight seal. The tape is replaced periodically to ensure that the adhesive is still working properly.\n\nWhen the tape is removed you can see how the two pieces (top and bottom) of the container come together to form an overlapping seam.\n\nThe top layer of items includes: a red cotton bandana (multi purpose), an Alok Sak waterproof bag to store the contents of the kit in after removing them from the container, a set of bogota lock picks, a piece of rite in the rain waterproof paper with emergency contact information and phone numbers for various people, as well as blood type and medical allergies, $60 in cash, and for morale \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d lyrics and music.\n\nThe Fire Starting Category. Some of the components in this category have multiple uses other than fire starting, but we will just focus on their fire capabilities. The list of items includes: 2 BIC mini lighters, waterproof matches and strikers (in sealed bag), beeswax tea light candle, tinder quick fire starter tabs, fresnel lens (in green sleeve), collapsable pocket bellows, large ferro rod, small ferro rod (backup), ferro rod scraper, 3 ranger bands (made from bicycle inner tube).\n\nNext is the water group. Within it is: 48 aqua tabs for water purification (30 min wait time), Water filter straw (good for 20 gallons), 2 coffee filters (for sediment removal), and 3 1-liter whirlpak water storage bags. (Water could also be stored in the aloksak if needed).\n\nThe food procurement category. It contains: 3 ft rubber tubing (It is more of a multi use item but it can be used for a sling shot if needed), stainless steel snare wire (also multipurpose), 50lb braided fishing line, spectra cord, fishing bobber, aluminum foil, 2 bags of peppermint tea, and a fishing kit. The fishing kit has various sized hooks, sinkers, lures, safety pins, and an assortment of sewing needles.\n\nThe shelter building category. It contains: Adventure Medical Kits Emergency 2 Person Bivy and 100 feet Spectra cord (350 lb breaking strength).\n\nThe signaling, light, and navigation group: Fenix LD02 flashlight with three lithium AAA batteries, orange flagging tape, AMK mini signal mirror, ACME whistle, mini button compass, SERE compass.\n\nThe medical equipment group includes: 3 packs of Steri-strips, knuckle style bandages, chapstick, electrolyte tablets, ibuprofen, a small cut down bar of soap, and a pill capsule necklace that contains personal medications.\n\nNext is the escape and evasion gear. This gear includes: set of Bogota Pi lock picks, Bogota mini lock picks, 3 piece quick pick shim set, small silver cross, diamond file rod, escape stick (with built in handcuff key, saw, shim), standard handcuff key, plastic handcuff key, $60 cash, and a USB drive with scans of important documents.\n\nLastly is the tools category. Within this category there is: multiple sheets of rite in the rain paper, fisher space pen refill, survival tips info sheet, Victorinox Swisstool, Sharpie mini, 2 metal zip ties, 2 plastic zip ties, cut down 24 TPI hacksaw blade, P-51 can opener, diamond/wood mini file from leatherman surge, derma safe razor knife, roll of duct tape max tape, small knife sharpener, super glue and cap, red bandana, and a point it internal translator guide.\n\nAll of the contents of the kit will fit inside of the included ALOK SAK waterproof bag.\n\nThis survival kit would be stored in a back pack inside of a Safari Tactical headset comms bag along with an Israeli pressure bandage, king size snickers bar, and an official US military Survival, Evasion, and Recovery manual (the most recent year I have in my collection is from March 2007). Along with that I would have a fixed blade knife. In this case my Randall Made Model 14.\n\nHope you enjoyed.\n\nEdit: So some of you expressed interest in buying a kit if a made them. I crunched some numbers and when all components are factored in (some of which aren\u2019t available anymore or have to be substituted) the price would be around $625. If interested still then PM me and I\u2019ll share more information on it. Thanks!",

                                    "comment": "This is my personal survival kit that I take with me when I travel and go into the woods. It is inspired by the survival kits that the US military would issue aviators during WW2 and Vietnam. It is large enough to hold everything that I think I will need if I find myself spending a couple nights unexpectedly in the wilderness or if I got into a situation while traveling abroad. But also small enough to fit in my jeans back pocket, hardshell jacket pocket, or a small backpack or vest pocket. It contains both wilderness and urban survival items as you will see as you scroll through the images. \n\nTo begin, the container was custom made to suit my size requirements while also providing a suitable container to boil water, make a shallow soup, and protect the contents within. The material is food grade aluminum and was created from a Trangia large mess tin. The container is two pans press fitted together with a seam in the middle. The seam is sealed with two layers of 3M 8979N nuclear grade duct tape (not even kidding about the nuclear grade thing) and then both sides of the duct tape seams are sealed with several wraps of 3M electrical tape. Not only does this seal the contents of the container from water, it also provides extra tape that can be used to repair items or used as a visual marker. The red piece of tape on the top is a pull tab to make retrieving the kit from a bag easier. \n\nAdditionally on the outside of the container is a laminated contents list and a Velcro cord wrap to keep the container closed after removing the tape on the outside.\n\nYou can see the amount of tape that is wrapped around the container to provide a water tight seal. The tape is replaced periodically to ensure that the adhesive is still working properly.\n\nWhen the tape is removed you can see how the two pieces (top and bottom) of the container come together to form an overlapping seam.\n\nThe top layer of items includes: a red cotton bandana (multi purpose), an Alok Sak waterproof bag to store the contents of the kit in after removing them from the container, a set of bogota lock picks, a piece of rite in the rain waterproof paper with emergency contact information and phone numbers for various people, as well as blood type and medical allergies, $60 in cash, and for morale \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d lyrics and music.\n\nThe Fire Starting Category. Some of the components in this category have multiple uses other than fire starting, but we will just focus on their fire capabilities. The list of items includes: 2 BIC mini lighters, waterproof matches and strikers (in sealed bag), beeswax tea light candle, tinder quick fire starter tabs, fresnel lens (in green sleeve), collapsable pocket bellows, large ferro rod, small ferro rod (backup), ferro rod scraper, 3 ranger bands (made from bicycle inner tube).\n\nNext is the water group. Within it is: 48 aqua tabs for water purification (30 min wait time), Water filter straw (good for 20 gallons), 2 coffee filters (for sediment removal), and 3 1-liter whirlpak water storage bags. (Water could also be stored in the aloksak if needed).\n\nThe food procurement category. It contains: 3 ft rubber tubing (It is more of a multi use item but it can be used for a sling shot if needed), stainless steel snare wire (also multipurpose), 50lb braided fishing line, spectra cord, fishing bobber, aluminum foil, 2 bags of peppermint tea, and a fishing kit. The fishing kit has various sized hooks, sinkers, lures, safety pins, and an assortment of sewing needles.\n\nThe shelter building category. It contains: Adventure Medical Kits Emergency 2 Person Bivy and 100 feet Spectra cord (350 lb breaking strength).\n\nThe signaling, light, and navigation group: Fenix LD02 flashlight with three lithium AAA batteries, orange flagging tape, AMK mini signal mirror, ACME whistle, mini button compass, SERE compass.\n\nThe medical equipment group includes: 3 packs of Steri-strips, knuckle style bandages, chapstick, electrolyte tablets, ibuprofen, a small cut down bar of soap, and a pill capsule necklace that contains personal medications.\n\nNext is the escape and evasion gear. This gear includes: set of Bogota Pi lock picks, Bogota mini lock picks, 3 piece quick pick shim set, small silver cross, diamond file rod, escape stick (with built in handcuff key, saw, shim), standard handcuff key, plastic handcuff key, $60 cash, and a USB drive with scans of important documents.\n\nLastly is the tools category. Within this category there is: multiple sheets of rite in the rain paper, fisher space pen refill, survival tips info sheet, Victorinox Swisstool, Sharpie mini, 2 metal zip ties, 2 plastic zip ties, cut down 24 TPI hacksaw blade, P-51 can opener, diamond/wood mini file from leatherman surge, derma safe razor knife, roll of duct tape max tape, small knife sharpener, super glue and cap, red bandana, and a point it internal translator guide.\n\nAll of the contents of the kit will fit inside of the included ALOK SAK waterproof bag.\n\nThis survival kit would be stored in a back pack inside of a Safari Tactical headset comms bag along with an Israeli pressure bandage, king size snickers bar, and an official US military Survival, Evasion, and Recovery manual (the most recent year I have in my collection is from March 2007). Along with that I would have a fixed blade knife. In this case my Randall Made Model 14.\n\nHope you enjoyed.\n\nEDIT #1: It seems like a lot of people are interested in purchasing the kit if I were to make and sell them. Based on the requests I\u2019m going to start crunching some numbers and see about opening an Etsy shop. I appreciate everyone\u2019s interest and enjoy the comradery that this community has. Thank you to each and everyone of you. You make this sub what it is.",

One to pack away nice and neat like this and a duplicate that you don\u2019t mind tearing into to practice with.  That manual will do little good if the first time you open it is when you need it.  Master fire making with each item you have in the kit.  Try fishing with just the equipment you have there and learn techniques needed for that. Practice land navigation, lock picking. Etc.    \nThe problem with an awesome kit like this is most won\u2019t want to get into it often enough to practice.  \nOne last note, hand cuff key buried in that kit will do you little good.  Some items you are going to want to find ways to stash on your person and accessible when needed.  If they have you in handcuffs, they\u2019ve probably taken your kit.  \nGreat job though.

You could even wrap a length of the black tape from end to end, rather than just a little piece on each end.\n\nThe reason is that duct tape often leaves a lot of gunk when you remove it from a surface, which may cause conductivity problems with your batteries when the duct tape is removed.\n\nSorry, it's the Electrician in me that hates to see duct tape used as an electrical insulator.",

The picks were $50 and the multitool goes for roughly $120 now due to price increases. So those two items make up a third or so of cost.",

If it's not, your bow will split easily at some point, and the weak point will be where that ring was damaged or cut through.\n\nBowyers will take a much larger stave and painstakingly choose which ring they want to be the back of their bow. They will look for a thick one at that right spot. Then they will carefully remove wood to expose only that ring on the back of the bow.\n\nIn a survival/quick method of creating a bow, the fastest way to ensure that the back of your bow is all one solid ring is to not remove any wood from it, then you are guaranteed that the bow back is all made up of the last ring. This isn't usually the optimal ring to use, but it's the easiest one to get right.",

I believe I read somewhere that he had some kind of gastro-intestinal issue that he was managing with meds but was unable to take with him on the show.   He had been working on managing it with natural remedies that could be foraged in the wild.   Unfortunately he was unable to locate any in his time out there.   He also had not eaten protein in some time because he wasnt able to hunt or trap anything.   That sharp reintroduction of protein combined with the lack of meds/foraged remedy caused his gastro-intestinal issue to flare up and he had to tap out.   He was great to watch on the show, I felt bad for the guy.  Ultimately he says he tapped out for his family.   He couldn't risk harming himself to the point where he couldnt provide for them long term for the sake of the show.\n\nThat being said, that muskrat he ate was nasty.",

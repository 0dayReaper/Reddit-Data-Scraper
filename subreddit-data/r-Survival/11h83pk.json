I agree with comments that the sharpness isn't the best due to the steepness of the secondary bevel. I have a worksharp so I just ground a new bevel and its great.\n\nThe knife is super heavy, super chunky, and super big. I like these qualities because I generally use it in place of a hatchet or small axe. It can serve for finer work, but it's not great at it until you have a new bevel.\n\nIf your goal is to have a one-tool solution this is a great option. Can do everything, but none of it really well.",

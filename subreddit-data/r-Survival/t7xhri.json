            "comment": "This shelter is located in Western V\u00e4rmland, Sweden. It's built on private land. I used dead pines, spruces branches and moss. The moss is not protected and will grow back in full amount within a couple of years, It will also keep growing on this shelter. \n\nOn this trip I improved a lean-to shelter, making it more suitable for long term living and for my dogs, by building a front wall. This shelter will be my home while constructing my next big bushcraft shelter, a dry stone house. I was accompanied by Whisky and we had the best time with beautiful views, cold weather and sunshine.\n\nIf you are interested in watching a video of this trip click here: https://youtu.be/i64DwW-hjnQ",

Doorways are traditionally straight vertical for extremely good reasons.",

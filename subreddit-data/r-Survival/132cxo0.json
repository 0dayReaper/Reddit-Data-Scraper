Teepee and log cabin fires are quick to get going, then they collapse and typically turn into an unstructured fire but can ignite larger diameter wood placed over it, like the star or lean-too in the pictures. Of the four types shown, the teepee is the best bet to start a successful fire, unless the wood is insanely dry, there is lots of kindling and possibly aided with a propellant.",

Do with it what you want to do. Then once it's ready to settle down, put a couple good large logs in a pentagram shape on the outer most ring of the coals. \n\nAs those logs catch and ignite, the coals will fall down into the center.",

Some type of structure on the prevailing wind side, keeps the embers from flying around and creating unintended nuisance fires and the rate of burn is greatly decreased. Rocks, earth, hole in the ground are examples of a wind shield. \nFor rain, if there is a natural overhang of rock or digging into the side of an embankment could provide some shelter, depending of course in the duration and intensity of the rain. If materials are available, in light rain a simple lean too made of sticks and covered with evergreen boughs, with enough clearance to avoid burning, can slow rain down but the fire will still get wet. If the fire is hot enough it can overcome light rain. Finding dry wood is the real challenge here.",

It\u2019s partly about how much fuel the fire has access to, and more so about how much new air can circulate underneath and around the fire. A fire with less air circulation will burn less completely and be colder and more smokey. \n\nFor example there are configurations with particular application, like self feeding long fires which feed themselves and burn much more slowly, while having a wider footprint to provide more spread out radiant heat. Less ideal for cooking, or heating a group of people, but more ideal for keeping you and your shelter warm throughout the night.",

I can make a small little cabin starter pill and make a bigger right on top of it (if I did that with the teepee it tends to fall over trying to set it up and having to start over). Light the little one and  forget it. I feel it gets more air all the way around it better.  You don't have to worry about logs falling around.  It's much easier to stack the logs than worry about them falling off or around like the teepee method.  I feel the cabin method gets hotter, but it does use more logs, which is fine in my situation because the group is always 4-12 or more  people,  so there is always enough firewood that is brought.  This takes place primarily in the winter,  so we really like the fire big.  I will normally use the teepee method when it's 3 or fewer people.  For one, the fire doesn't need to be as big, and I feel it uses less firewood.",

            "comment": "I find teepee fires to be a good way to ignite a lot of subpar or wet wood. If you create layers of similar size wood, as one layer catches and burns, it drys out the next layer. You just have to make sure there are enough tinder and twigs in the first to start the chain reaction. \n\nThe lean too is my usual way to start a normal fire with normal, relatively dry firewood. Usually one large log is used as a heat shield/ place to lean sticks. The. As the tinder goes, I add in two handful of twigs, then two handful if sticks. I wait for the previous handful to catch really well before adding more wood. \n\nThe benefit to a lean to is that it keeps wood off the coal base and allow you to fuss with the fire it grows. \n\nThe log cabin is my go to once the fire is established. The biggest benefit is that you can keep piling on wood, but avoid smoothering the coal base. It's also a very good fire to cook over. You can stack larger logs so you get coals, but feed small sticks and twigs in the middle to make the fire hotter on demand. \n\n\nThe biggest thing for a good efficient survival fire, is to not smother your fire's heart. Aka, your coal base where the fire is the hottest. If you out really large logs there, they act as heat sinks, block flow of oxygen, and cool the fire. Meaning you have to build a larger fire and burn more wood. If you leave the heart open, the fire will be hotter, use less wood, and be easier to manage.",

If you need to generate a large bed of coals this is a great method. \n\nIf you light them from the top they will burn for a long time without requiring additional fuel as the fire does not climb down very well except for where it touches the next level or pieces crumble down to ignite from below. Built well and with practice you can get a few hours without needing intervention and without the usual space required for regular low maintenance self-feeding fires, or the star fire that requires you routinely adjust the logs inward.

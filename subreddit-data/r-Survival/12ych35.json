Anger or frustration or terror burn calories and limit our ability to think. Being able to just breathe and think through a situation carefully make such a huge difference. Her plan with the insulation for storing water is the kind of thing that would not occur to you if you were panicked.\nI can imagine how awful and yet perfect it might have felt that her husband died on the anniversary of her plane crash and fiance's death. Like \"Oh. Of course.\"",

I can't imagine surviving in the jungle for eight days with the level of injuries she sustained. The broken hip, knee, and jaw alone would have been enough to do a a lot of people in. When you add in the punctured lung, the odds of survival have got to be in the single digits.",

I feel much more at home out in the wilds than I ever have in a city. However, even having ADHD myself, I still find it incredible that she was able to take a location associated with that much trauma and transform it into a place a relaxation and safety. I could see it being peaceful at the time thanks to shock and the insane amount of endorphins/adrenaline pumping through her system. Her ability to maintain that state, even years afterward, is astonishing though.",

My emotions were still there, just muted until everything that could be done, had been and it was safe to deal with them.\n\nThere are a lot of documented cases of people completely freezing up or shutting down under similar circumstances though. I\u2019ve heard multiple theories that being neurodivergent helps prevent that, but idk that it\u2019s ever been officially studied.",

You ask me about my life 5-10 years ago, I'm going to remember everything else about me that shaped where I worked first and then finally get there and then wade through the cringies in order to start to assess the dumbass question about \"duties and skills...\" Excuse me?\n\n...fuck it. If I had stayed in the same industry my entire life, maybe I could rattle it off without thinking or follow ups. But that is not the case....Application rescinded. :'( this isn't a therapists couch lol what a rude fucking question--To ask a person about their past wtf is wrong with you? I'm not a cultural fit at this company where you ambush people into memory lane (/S, in that I hear it is crazy but I also feel the truth of that emotion to my bones)",

The plane finally landed about 100 miles from home and sat on the tarmac with dozens of other planes.  Argued with the flight attendant that I was getting off NOW.  She was nasty and called the pilot.  Pilot must have seen crazy in my eyes, because they let people off that wanted to - about 20 other people got off with me.  The last thing the attendant said (insert snotty voice here) was \"You can't have your luggage if you get off now!\"  I told her she could KEEP my dirty clothes, and danced down the stairs they rolled up to the plane.  I rented the last car available at the tiny airport and drove home through the driving rain at 1 am.  Best drive I ever had, and I will NEVER, EVER fly again.  I used vacation days so I could take the train for business after that, luxuriating in the days of sheer boredom.  This lady is bat shit crazy to ever get on a plane again, God love her.",

At the end of the day, however, it is the PIC who is responsible for the lives of everyone under their care, on an aircraft. \n\nI frankly enjoy seeing out-of-control passengers getting their comeuppance... too many lives are at risk, when everyone is holed up in an aluminum tube loaded with jet fuel. \n\nIt is good you recognize your weaknesses. We all know, of course, that road travel is far more dangerous than flying. And there's nothing wrong with train travel. I just returned from a few weeks in Japan, and the Shinkansen is so awesome, outpacing even the ICE and AVE.",

An area near me that has a few of them is also filled with cow paths that can be indistinguishable from even the active,   official trails, so it's very easy to get lost. Due to the terrain, you could even get cliffed out or fall up there if you aren't careful. Following a bridge to look for a road to look for people is a great idea, but there's no guarantee you'll find anyone or anything that will help.\n\nEdit: in the local area I'm thinking of, your best bet would actually be to just ignore any bridges and follow the large creek down to civilization, instead of getting lost in a spaghetti of overgrown, mostly abandoned and dead-end trails on the side of a mountain. But it looks like these guys were on a island, and the whole thing could be totally uninhabited.",

A well-built abandoned bridge will easily outlast an abandoned road. The main road up that mountain I mentioned was abandoned in a reroute in the 80s, and the sections that aren't maintained as side roads have almost entirely vanished, swallowed by aspens and shrubs and now more and more conifers. There are so many abandoned old mining, ranching, and fishing structures out west. Some of the roads in that area I mentioned with old bridges were abandoned by 1900 because of changes in water rights. It's totally feasible to find a weird bridge to nowhere out here in the west.",

            "comment": "This is unfortunately how so many people are lost or killed each year. The fact is, situations like this video *don't happen to survivalists*. Because survivalists prepare. One of the first things anyone should do when planning a trip into the wilderness, is look at the weather forecast. They clearly didn't. On top of that I think I spotted one lifejacket between four people, and nobody was even wearing it. They didn't check their battery, AND didn't bring paddles. These guys were begging for catastrophe. \n\nIf they weren't found, with how gnarly that storm looked (and how utterly incompetent they clearly are), I think at least one of them wouldn't have even survived the first night. Clothes soaked through, temperature dropping, hail soaked ground. Hypothermia can happen in minutes. Worst part about this is that they all laugh it off as a \"wild adventure\" without realizing how close they all were to dying in those woods. I'm confident all of them would have been dead in days if they weren't rescued. But we better record it for tiktok so we can get internet points. \n\nIt's unfortunate because everyone, to differing degrees, has something I like to call \"protagonist syndrome\". Everyone just, in their hearts, believes they are the main character. It's like they think they have \"plot armor\". Where I live, people die *every single year* mere miles from civilization. And it happens *exactly* like this video shows. A person, or people, wake up and decide one morning that they're going to do a day hike. They aren't experienced hikers, but it's just walking up hill how hard can it be? They drive up to the trailhead, get out of their cars in t-shirts, shorts, and vans sneakers. Maybe one of them has a bottle of water with them that they bought at a gas station on the way there. They have their wallet, cellphone, keys. And that's it. Up the trail they go, and they don't come back. Next day they're in the news as rescue crews search, a few days later the body is found. \n\nPoint is, you're not the main character. The plot can change.",

I like the idea, but I\u2019m not entirely confident that it would even work well or at all. Anyone who has ever had a wire saw, do they work? What did you use it for. If it didn\u2019t work, what would you recommend instead?",

I've seen some people have some success with the chainsaw blade type ones but really your best bet is the folding boreal bow saws or a silky. Its really easy to waist alot of time and calories cutting wood with junk saws. Anything under 2\" diameter can easily be processed using two close trees to break it down, as long as it's not green.",

People seem to think highly of the Bahco Laplander as well. They're both available at $25-30 and will zip through any limb under 4\" like it's nothing.\n\nWire saws and \"chain saws\" are all pretty gimmicky and will bind really easy from the slightest amount of sideways pressure. They're also difficult to use right and maintain enough tension to keep them working right, which leads to more binding.",

It's in fact the superior tool paired with a stick and some parachord, targeting dead overhead on live trees. Your silky pole will make much easier cuts but for the weight and form factor there are use cases where I'd def prefer the wire. \n\nFor a &lt;$5 multiuse tool with close to negligable weight I'm surprised to see this get quite so much hate. \n\nYall, it's steel wire, if you break it, that's your fault, not the tools'. Take the time to make handles or a bow. Cut slowly and let the saw do the work. Be smart about the work you expect to get done with it. The teeth are tiny on these, maximize the length of contact to move the most material per stroke. It's more like a scroll saw than a chainsaw, don't try to make it do things it shouldn't and you'll be fine. If you plan to move a lot of material, bring a material saw.\n\nThey also make fine snares, shitty but better than nothing tourniquets or weapons (bolas, sling, flail, piano wire), potholders, and the components are also useful even after it fails. With time they will cut through wood, flesh, bone, pvc, and some can do stone or metal.\n\nEct honestly, idk the more I think about the things Ive done with one of these the more I feel like yall are trippin on this one",

Spent most of the day hiking in, so when we got there we had enough daylight left to scratch some line then start a warming fire &amp; bed down for the night. Sometime around midnight the rain rolled in, started with light hail then became a torrential downpour. We tucked our tarps around our line gear then ran for cover, and eventually found an overhang with a little dent you wouldn't call a cave but could get out of the rain. We huddled there freezing and waiting for a break in the downpour. When it finally came, some of us scrambled out to *try* and find dry tinder, while our captain began using a Pulaski to start chopping away at a smallish tree at the front of the overhang. He used the ax head to slice thin curls of wood off the tree to use as tinder. Combining that with the small amount of dry-ish leaves we brought back was enough to get another warming fire started and our teeth finally stopped chattering. Axes have their place.",

These have been great, not as light and small as a wire saw, but much smaller/lighter than a folding or fix-bladed saw, and cuts bigger logs. Miles better than a bow saw. The Nordic brand are spendy, but I've cleared trail with mine (20+ 5-12\" logs in one session) and no problems. I have cheaper versions too, but haven't put those through the ringer yet.",

They can work if you attach it to a curved piece of wood to act as a bow saw but not that well (which is how you're supposed to use them). They're also made in China and break easy. A much better saw would be a pocket chainsaw - these actually work pretty decent and fit in a small pouch. \n\nYou can also break wood pretty easily by either bending it between two trees, slamming it against a big sharp rock, or breaking it with your knee.",

They would be free to leave at any time but if they wanted to stay they would need to help with the chores. I\u2019ll admit my wording was a little strange I was trying to be humorous. I apologize if it came off as me wanting to enslave people that surely wasn\u2019t my intent nor would I do such a thing in a real world scenario. Have a good day I hope you don\u2019t think all preppers are doomsday jack asses. I prepare for all types of things mostly natural disasters and that kind of thing but with the current world situation it doesn\u2019t seem very crazy to prepare for a time when rule of law isn\u2019t being upheld. The people of Ukraine seem to be handling the situation in a humane way and that is what I would hope could happen here as well",

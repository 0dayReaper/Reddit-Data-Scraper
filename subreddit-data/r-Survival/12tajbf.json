I found its scratching on a dirt road where it had peed. Paw span as big as my hand. I got to thinking how little I knew how to handle it. Would bear spray be helpful? Loud whistle? If facing one that is approaching, I figured making myself look large with my hands up, not making eye contact, and backing away, NOT RUNNING, make sense. Thoughts?",

Dudes will back up dozens of yards with the cat slowly closing the distance before they shoot and kill it.  If you see the cat and it's approaching you go ahead and send one in the dirt beside it right away.  You got a good chance at scaring it from the sound and still got plenty of distance to line up a shot on target if it continues its advance.",

I can imagine if I were in that situation I would be pretty reluctant to take my sights off the big cat. Adrenaline gives you tunnel vision and all they're probably thinking about is making sure they can take a shot if they need to take one. Not saying that firing a warning shot is necessarily a bad idea, but I can kind of see why people don't usually do it.",

However with cats I tend to wonder more if they only slinker off in order to sneakily follow me! I\u2019ve had a mentor tell me a story of bow hunting and having a lion come up on him from behind in his fear he said he instinctively grabbed a nearby rock and threw it directly at the cats face and that it darted off. I can not remember his details on size but honestly as the years pass and with other footage I\u2019ve seen of determined cats \u2026 a rock isn\u2019t doing much persuasively versus a motivated and fully grown lion.

I think 10mm is most suitable and with training most folks can shoot decent groups of 2-3 shots in fairly rapid succession.\n\nAdditionally since we are discussing the shooter,\nI think the adrenaline dump one would have again with proper training with their carry gun that the felt recoil would be more manageable or at least less felt than if you are at the range and someone is allowed to compare the two cartridges.\n\nFinally, I carry what will work. I\u2019d rather not carry what feels as though it could be inadequate. Personally, I\u2019ve hiked in areas where lions are a concern but grizzlies are a much larger factor of consideration. And so I will carry the tool that works the best for the job it is needed for. I\u2019m not sure that you are considering 9mm wasn\u2019t designed for targets like lions or bear or moose too. Where as 10mm was made to penetrate. You\u2019re less likely to put down a charging bear/ attacking lion with a single or few bullets that hit vitals but rather several bullets entering and exiting the animal. &amp; I\u2019m sure in successes some do hit vital organs and arteries. The hide/ bones/ organs of a wild, large forest animal are much different than a squishy human.  \n\nMy point is the conversation should begin with what cartridge can actually be effective. 9mm is better than nothing but it really is not going to be the same level of reliability or versatility.",

When I used to hike a lot I would stop, turn around &amp; scan the area, then listen. Cougars can track you for miles, and will jump on you from behind, grabbing your neck, so basically stay aware, if you see one, stop, turn, face it. If that doesn't work, yell, throw rocks, sticks, or a gun blast near them. They don't normally go after full grown adults unless a dog you're with is the target, the dog starts messing with the cougar, you're running, or bike riding. They'll actually pick off the smallest person in a group, therefore children should be sandwiched between adults or in front of them. Never let kids get too far ahead or behind. Attacks on humans are uncommon, though.",

            "comment": "I don't see anyone mentioning this yet but if you ever actually see a mountain lion or cougar up close and personal there's probably something wrong with it AND you're in danger.\n\nThey're cats. They're experts at not being seen and stalking prey. They really, really don't like to be seen by humans.\n\nThe something wrong could be that it's sick. It could also be starving. Humans are not seen as attractive prey or a food source - which is different than brown or black bears who can become habituated to humans as a food source via their trash or the food they're carrying.\n\nCougar attacks in the US are extremely rare, and it's even more rare that a cougar will actually try to hunt and eat a human.\n\nAnother thing that could be \"wrong\" with the cougar is that it has a litter or kittens nearby, and this is probably the most dangerous kind of cougar encounter because while they don't see you as food or prey they do see you as a threat to their kittens.\n\nIn this case you do definitely want to leave the area without running, and you kind of have to cross your fingers and hope you're moving away from their kittens or den. Moving back the way you came towards civilization is likely the best choice.\n\nAnother thing I can share is that if you're out somewhere and you suddenly and intensely feel like you're being watched - you probably are.\n\nI've been in a lot of deserts, forests and mountains in the general west coast US area and southwest in cougar area and I've felt this about 3-4 times out of I don't know how many hundreds or thousands of adventures and the experience is very tangible and real. You just know something has a lock and eyes on you but you'll probably never see the cougar if they're watching you from far away, high up or even stalking you through the bushes.\n\nI had one encounter at night in the deep desert where there was something keeping pace with us off the fire road and we could barely hear pads on the sand and leaf litter paralleling us about 20 feet off into the scrub and we noped the fuck back to the fire and group.\n\nIn all of these cases I never saw the cougar. And out of all of my adventures I've seen a cougar in the wild exactly once and it was way up the side of a mountain on a rock perch, easily a good quarter to half mile away.\n\nI probably wouldn't have even seen it at all if I didn't notice a large, tawny colored rock shift and move, and I happened to have binoculars with me so I was able to get a closer look and confirm it was a cougar just being a big cat rolling around in the sun.\n\nI have, however, seen plenty of signs and tracks of cougars on hikes, especially in snow. Seeing tracks or signs is really common if you get out into cougar country on a regular basis and it doesn't mean you're immediately in danger.\n\nIn any of these cases what I start doing is intentionally making a lot more noise, starting with smaller stuff like letting my metal water bottle bang against a hiking stick, talking loudly and then maybe even escalating into some random yelling.\n\nI do also usually carry an emergency whistle but I've never used one for this purpose.\n\nMaking noise in the woods is generally a good idea anyway. While it's really nice to be able to walk silently through the woods to enjoy the peace and quiet, this stops being nice in a hurry if you startle a bear or cougar.\n\nAs for actual self defense with a face to face encounter?\n\nFor cougars, yes, making your self look bigger and making more noise and holding your ground and backing away slowly is the right thing to do. One tactic people talk about is inverting your jacket or outer layer to hold it overhead, or a hiking/trekking pole, or a bike or backpack.\n\nHaving something heavy like a pack or bike overhead can be thrown or dropped on them if they charge at you which may discourage them from continuing.\n\nPicking up suitable rocks and throwing them if you can isn't a bad idea either, there's that one cougar encounter video from a few years ago where the cougar was pursuing him back down the trail, and he probably should have picked up rocks and started throwing them much earlier than he did. As I recall, in the end the cougar fled after the first or second thrown rock.\n\nAs for guns I have serious doubts that a 9mm or even 45 will reliably drop or stop a cougar. It's not easy to hit a roughly human sized target with a hand gun at distances over about 20 feet even in the best of conditions at a range and a non-moving target. This is way more difficult if your hands are shaking and you're high as fuck on adrenaline.\n\nI'm even a decent shot with handguns, rifles and shotguns but I have absolutely no weird ideas or overconfidence that I could reliably hit a moving cougar charging at me or even have enough time to draw, stand and aim before they can get to me.\n\nUnless I happen to be already walking around with a shotgun with some buckshot or other scatter shot presented and ready to shoot I know my chances of being able to actually draw, aim and fire before a cougar rushes me are really slim.\n\nThere's also the extreme danger of trying to draw, say, a holstered handgun in a panic, fumble with the safety and line up a shot. Way more people are killed or injured due to accidental discharges like this than there are people killed or injured by cougars.\n\nAnd accidentally shooting yourself or a partner in the back country is a really good way to end up bleeding out and dead because services are so far away. \n\nAnd if you're carrying weapons in the back country you really should also have an IFAK with real tourniquets, chest seals and all of that and you and everyone there should know how to use it and have actually trained with it. (Google \"Stop the Bleed\" for online and real world training, or see /r/tacticalmedicine for more info.)\n\nTrying to shoot a cougar is even more difficult because when cougars attack or charge they don't move into predictable ways, especially when they're feeling threatened and not hunting prey. They're not going to come at you in a straight line if they want to attack you.\n\nEver see a house cat go into play attack freakout mode where they're like skittering around sideways and lashing out with their paws, kind of like they're swiping and attacking as they move with each step with their claws out and paws spread?\n\nIt'll be like that, just a lot bigger and a lot less cute. They're going to skitter and lope at you in really unpredictable ways and it won't be an easy shot like at a gun range.\n\nIt's mainly going to be the noise that scares them off, which if it works, cool, but you can do that with a 22.\n\nIf I actually wanted to drop a cougar I'd be thinking more in terms of a shotgun with buckshot or slug loads, or even a larger rifle.\n\nDo I carry a weapon into the woods? Nope.\n\nBut I don't live around brown bears or polar bears. I would carry if I was backpacking in Alaska or maybe BC or the North Cascades in brown bear territories but as a practice I don't carry a weapon.\n\nI do carry bear spray and a bush knife if I'm going more than a few miles out, but the bush knife isn't a weapon but a tool and I know that it isn't going to do a whole lot if I get attacked by either a cougar or bear. I'm reaching for the pepper spray first.\n\nI'm a lot more concerned about other humans within the first few miles of a trailhead or border to wilderness. Once I get deeper into wilderness the people you encounter out there tend to be a lot more mellow and sane because they're out there for the same reasons you are.\n\nAnyway, the chances of a cougar encounter or an attack are extremely rare. It's good to think about but if you obsess over it you're just stressing yourself out.\n\nYou're way more likely to die in a car accident driving to get to the wilderness, or even injuring yourself with a weapon.",

In Oregon, Idaho, and Washington combined, there have only been 3 recorded deaths caused by cougars in history. In the past 100 years in North America there have been a total of 126 recorded cougar attacks, 27 of which were fatal. For reference, 549 people died of unintentional firearm discharges in the US in 2021 alone. If you started carrying a gun around to protect yourself from cougars, the gun would be likelier to kill you than a cougar. \n\n Make noise as you hike, and they\u2019ll mostly move away, because they don\u2019t want to encounter you either. On top of that, like many people pointed out, if a cat actually wants to hunt you, you probably won\u2019t see it or have an opportunity to scare it off first. But if you do, you have the right idea about making yourself big, yelling, waving a stick, backing away slowly, etc. Experts debate whether you should maintain or avoid eye contact, but agree that you should stay facing it. Cats may be different than dogs in this way. If a big cat thinks you\u2019re not looking for even half a second, they\u2019ll take that as their opportunity to pounce. Some experts recommended staring at their ears or the top of their head, so they know you\u2019re watching them but you don\u2019t risk aggravating them. Bear spray can\u2019t hurt. If it attacks, go for the throat and eyes. \n\nA lot of people leaving these comments just have fantasies of shooting a big cat in the head and having a \u2018cool\u2019 story to tell, not actual info about mountain lions (edit: the same people downvoting my comment). If we were talking about hiking in Alaska during a salmon run, yes, bring a rifle. But this isn\u2019t that.",

At first, we thought it was a group of people at the boat ramp, which was about 1/4 of the way around the reservoir (~150 acres). We had passed them when we started our hike around the lake. However, it sounded different than what you'd expect from friends goofing around. Also, it was closer than they were. It sounded like a woman screaming a baby crying at the same time (hindsight IS always 20/20). The people got in their vehicles and left real quick. The screaming continued. Then we saw it. It stepped out onto the logging road we were walking down, and it was only about 50 yards away. There was enough light left to see it well enough... distinct face, long tail, and tawny tone. It definitely was not a bobcat. We had one of those on the farm i grew up on. This was bigger. I could still make out the dark end of the tail as well. I say all of this because I live in a state where they are not supposed to be, but there are many people who would attest to having seen them here. As soon as my friend realized what it was, he positioned himself to run, and I grabbed his shirt to keep him from running. I was scared but remained calm. I made sure it knew I was watching it as we walked, and we got to the side of the road closest to the water. If needed, we would grab rocks and big sticks to defend ourselves. It was starting to get dark and it cut into the woods to the side of the road that had 10-15 foot outcroppings that ran along the rest of that side of the reservoir. I could hear it pacing us as we walked for the next 1/4 mile or so. I didn't have a gun, but even if I did, I wouldn't have shot it unless it meant to harm me. I currently work in wildlife conservation, spending a lot of time in the woods, alone, in the dark, and I keep this experience in my mind when I'm working out in the field. I remember to stay alert and listen to the woods at all times.",

I think a lot of people hear stories and see videos of cat encounters like yours, and confuse that with \u2018cat attack.\u2019 They interpret a cat growling or charging a few steps as aggressive behavior/intention to attack. But the reality is that the cat is thinking the same thing we are: \u201coh shit, that thing\u2019s scary! I\u2019d better make myself as big, loud, and intimidating as possible so it\u2019ll hopefully leave me alone.\u201d Human and cat both just want to walk away unscathed, but have a little trouble trusting that the other won\u2019t make the first move. Give them what they want (space &amp; predictability) and things usually work out just fine.\n\nThanks for your conservation work! Without people like you we wouldn\u2019t still have wilderness to enjoy (including these animals).",

If you're really worried about big cats, protecting your neck is the best bet as they will almost always try to bite your neck and immobilize you. Bear spray that is accessible and not running away are your best bets. They can get territorial but big cat attacks on adults are extremely rare and most people who get attacked are joggers who trigger the cats hunting instincts.",

There are no shortage of videos you can YouTube and see encounters and what those people did. Generally speaking, if it has decided you are food, a threat, or are somehow infringing upon its territory, they are pretty relentless.\n\nAll that said, it has to be some combination of things that get you out unscathed. In no particular order, if you are hiking/camping in cougar territory, here's my list:\n\n1. Be aware. You can't have tunnel vision on what's just ahead of you. Look way ahead, look way off to the sides, and check behind you - often. These guys are incredibly camouflaged in their natural environments, and your best bet at seeing on before it's on top of you is catching movement.\n2. Be loud. If it hears you ahead of time, it's more likely to keep its distance. If you sneak into its little area, it's more likely to be aggressive.\n3. Don't bring little kids or animals out with you. A child or little dog are perfect sizes to encourage a cougar to engage.\n4. Bear spray/mace sprays can be great, but its effectiveness will vary by brand, and you just don't know for sure if it will work until after you've deployed it. Further, depending on how hard and in what direction the wind is blowing, it may not be an option at all. I'd still carry a reputable brand that has some range to it.\n5. A high caliber handgun as a last resort is effective but realize you might still take some damage depending on how things unfold. The problem, generally, with firearms is that barring a perfect hit - which is tough in a stressful situation with a moving target - the cougar isn't going to just drop dead, and it's also not guaranteed it will run off. It may actually provoke an attack, even if your shot was effectively fatal. There is also no shortage of videos of this. The one that comes to mind first is the lion charging the hunter as it eats rifle round after rifle round. It dies, but it takes a swipe at him on his way out. Similar results possible here. But if you can manage a shot to the head, lungs, heart, etc. you should be OK. Just make sure you're carrying .357 mag or larger. In this scenario it's not hunting, your goal is as quick a death as possible. As many controlled shots as you can get off until it's gone/not moving/you're out of rounds.\n6. Don't run. Do maintain eye contact. Make yourself big. Yell.\n\nThank you for subscribing to cougar facts. Hope you never need them!",

Spray, noise maker, firearm, something to throw, etc. Fight like you are the 3rd monkey to the ark and it's starting to rain.\n\nWhen I am in black bear, Cougar, bobcat, Grey wolf areas of MI, I carry my Ruger GP100 .357 mag with 158 grain personal protection rounds along with other accessories. I have drawn my pistol to low ready 1x and put my hand on the pistol ready to draw 1x - both times were for rattlesnakes. Neither time did I need to shoot, but the first time was instructive as I has just started carrying and had the pistol in hand in less than 1.5 seconds (so my training kicked in). Just before that camping trip, I kept getting hits for .38 Special Snakeshot but coming out of a rifled barrel it would likely spin out leaving a hole in the center (and a snake on your leg). She was damn big for a Massasauga rattlesnake, but she was just protecting her 2-3 little ones there.\n\nOn that same camping trip, one of the guys was taking a run on the Iargo Springs trail and a Cougar ran across the trail in front of him and up a tree, shaking it violently. He had that \"stare\" when he got back to camp and was shaken. Turns out, the DNR had trail cams up there and had been monitoring the cat for awhile, all while lying to the public about it. \n\nI had experiences with black bears before I started carrying and the sound one made I never want to hear again in my life. When you see a 300+ lbs black bear in the wild, you realize just how small man is.\n\nYou will default to your training, or lack thereof, when the \"moment\" arrives, which includes the mental/emotional decision to protect your own life above all else. I pray I never have to draw my pistol in the \"moment\" ever again but will do so when/if needed.",

See, aside from Vancouver island, it\u2019s REALLY hard to find a higher concentration of cougar than around here. And I know old dudes that have been hunting them their entire lives and have NEVER SEEN A SINGLE ONE.  \n\nSo why the marlin 3030? Why hunt cougars at all? Because it\u2019s a very light gun, and a great excuse to get out into the woods. They know damn well they\u2019ll never get one, the point is to get some peace and quiet.  \n\nSo think about that. People spend their whole lives hunting one of the densest cougar spots in America, purely because they know they\u2019ll never see one.  \n\nYou can more or less just plan for bear, and not worry about the cat. Statistically speaking, you will likely never actually encounter one, and if you do, it\u2019ll be trying to figure out how to get away without being seen. If you do somehow end up tangling with one, fight it. A fight is the absolute last thing they want to risk. Even if they kill you they probably die from injury, so they really won\u2019t bother. \n\nWith very few exceptions the people who DO get attacked are joggers that get jumped from behind. Let me say that again, actual attacks are rounding error rare, and almost exclusively against people doing something extremely dumb like RUNNING through the know territory of an apex predator that attacks from stealth.  \n\nKeep in mind also, you posted this in the survival subreddit, so the premise is already that you aren\u2019t running, you are staying put, being as noisy and obvious as possible, waiting for ground search and rescue to show up. Cougars are not a concern.",

Don't fire a warning shot. Not because \"insert hyper masculine monologue here\", but because that shot will send adrenaline down both your veins, and you've got a dice roll between freeze, flee and fight, the cat has a coin toss between flee or fight. Those cats are FAST. closing distance between you and it will be much faster than a person. Having said that, your non-warning shot may quickly become a warning shot if it starts running at you, so brace yourself for follow up shots.\n\n6.

If you already have the stick, lift it up and wave it around to look bigger and threaten back. If the cat is making itself visible and threatening you, assume she is protecting cubs, and back away. Keep backing away! If you can get far enough away from her cubs, she will go back to them. If she charges, throw your backpack and keep backing up.

But always be aware of your surroundings and if you encounter something try to scare it away with loud noise. \n\nI just wouldn\u2019t want to ever be in large predator territory without a firearm. Especially for cougars and bears. Wolves don\u2019t typically attack people. Buy the other two are pretty much all or nothing. Cougars are very stealthy and silent, and bears, especially brown bears, can be easily spooked into a bad situation and you can\u2019t outrun or overpower them.",

            "comment": "All of the above would be good if you are facing a lone wolf or a bear. If you're talking cats, there's not much you can do to prevent the attack as you will not see it coming. You might if you have some background hunting/tracking as you might be better at reading surroundings, but even then you wouldn't foresee an attack before it is too late. The only thing I would personally hope to have on me in the eventuality of this scenario is a quick draw knife. Well, and really cold blood to act as fast as possible, as they will jump for the neck first chance they get. However, most cats will not attack humans as they are really skittish and they chose their battles way better than people do. So your chances of being ambushed by one are really, really low. You might, however, stumble upon one by mistake. Depending on the terrain and the wind, you might surprise a cat by mistake. If that happens (again, highly unlikely, but more likely than being attacked by one out of the blue), you should back away slowly facing the animal. If it follows, it means you are on his turf. Just keep backing away using a slow and steady pace. You can make noise, throw stuff, DON'T start waving  your limbs around but try to be as big as possible. That is if you meet an adult. If you meet an adult and his kit, only move back slow and steady. No noises, no throwing, nothing that escalates the situation as the mother will respond to the smallest form of aggression to protect the kit.",

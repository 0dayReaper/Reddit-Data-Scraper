As a general rule of thumb liquid medications are pretty unstable whereas pills are more stable. For example I wouldn't trust liquid antibiotics past 3 mos the but pills are probably ok for years. The us military actually did a study in this and didn't find any significant deterioration years after expiration date.. If you know any basic chemistry, small molecules, for example salicylate (aspirin) are much more stable than large molecules such as insulin, vaccines etc. Then there are a few medications that are known to be very unstable, such as nitroglycerin, vitamin c. In general keeping medications at stable low temperature and low humidity increase shelf life, but those factors may be difficult to control and survival situations. However, keeping medications away from light can also increase shelf life for some are going to come and that is a factor that you can control in most survival situations. These are generalizations it may not apply to every medication.",

They had tons and tons of unopened medicine that they felt might be wasteful to throw away.\n\nSo they decided to send samples of everything they had for testing, 100s of different medicines. It was found that the majority of medicine lasts far beyond its expiration date and suggested shelf life, depending on its type.\n\nPills like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc were all 90%+ effective even years later. What's better, is that most otc medications also don't become dangerous to take, they just work slightly less effectively.\n\nThings to avoid: epipens, insulin, cough syrup, pain medication. Pretty much anything liquid, potent, or immediately important. These all lose significant efficacy past their expiration and can cause more harm than good in many cases.\n\nThis idea/\"study\" actually led to the creation of the Shelf Life Extension Program that the DoD uses so they don't have to throw medicine away. If it's still effective when they test it, the keep it. \n\nI don't have a full list of medicine for you, it's late right now and I work early lol. But I figured this is a good starting point. \n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/expiration-dating-extension",

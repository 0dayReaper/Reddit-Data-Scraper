            "comment": "When I set out to do this challenge last winter, I was hoping to build a debris shelter with walls at least 3 ft thick, but I soon realized I greatly underestimated how much work that would be. My shelter was probably only 1 ft thick on the outside for the first night, but it did manage to keep me warm enough to get 6 hours of scattered sleep throughout the night wearing only clothes I would take day-hiking. Needless to say, I spent a lot more time raking leaves for the following night.\n\nInside, this shelter featured a twig box spring and at least 6 inches of compacted leaves on top of that. This is likely the only reason I managed to stay somewhat warm for that first night. If I could do it over, I would definitely not utilize this fallen tree for a ridge pole as it severely limited the area around my shelter that I could use for leaf collection. It also made it much more difficult to construct an igloo door, although that could have just been inexperience on my part.\n\nThis shelter was part of a 48 hour survival trip I did that had a somewhat goofy premise: I only had a watermelon and the clothes on my back to survive. While a bit silly, it did give me an opportunity to practice bow drill without a knife, make a debris shelter, and learn to function on a rather limited amount of calories.

Was it long enough for you to stretch out in?\n\nI teach wilderness survival so this is a hut we have people build on their second day out and sleep in that night. We always do it in the summer though as it\u2019s a beginner\u2019s course and we don\u2019t want anyone fighting the elements. \n\nPeople often really underestimate how much daylight they have in the woods. People will think \u201cwell sunset is at 9 so I can take my time making it\u201d without realizing darkness comes much sooner under a forest in full bloom. Getting your structure built plus a fire plus getting it lit using a tinder bundle and ferro rod when you\u2019re a newbie plus getting water to boil and filter etc takes so much longer than a beginner realizes. We\u2019ve had to fail people on the beginner course because their lack of urgency meant their structure was incomplete and they couldn\u2019t get a fire going in time. And we give them like 5h+ to do it.",

But I think that is largely in part due to poor site selection (Y shape of the tree limited collection area) and partially due to the season (debris seems a lot more broken down at end of winter).\n\nIt was plenty long enough for me. The first foot or so into the shelter was actually a big pile of leaves on top of my watermelon to help seal the entrance. Once this barrier was in place, the shelter was pretty much perfect length for me with little to no dead space. However the width was a bit too roomy for my liking but that was largely due to the massive size of my ridge pole which forced me to build it larger than I otherwise would have.\n\nDefinitely agree with how easy it is to overestimate time in the day. I knew my daylight would be more limited in March, but there were still several points on the first day where I just felt so demotivated by how much work still had to be done.",

Deadfalls are unstable and a shift in soil or strong wind or rot giving out could cause them to come crashing down on you. If it\u2019s a true survival situation and that\u2019s what you have to work with on short notice then ok, but ideally you need to build your shelter strategically against wind patterns and water drainage which a random deadfall may not be able to accommodate.",

There's all of the work building this that you mentioned, but my body also had to burn a lot more than usual just to maintain homeostasis given that my shelter never fully reached the thickness needed for these temps. I was able to keep myself warm enough, but not comfortably so.\n\nSince you brought up the melon math behind this, I'll share my calculations behind them. I originally wanted to do this challenge with 1 large watermelon (roughly 20 lbs), but I couldn't find anything but 'personal' sized watermelons in March. Considering there is extra rind with 3 smaller melons vs 1 large one, I figured that 22 lbs would be about equivalent. Based on what I could find online at the time, this should be roughly equivalent to 2,700 calories. However what I didn't consider is the mental challenge of consuming that much melon. By the end of the second day, I was so sick of it that I knew I would just finish up my second melon on the final morning and pack the third one out. So in reality, I likely only had about 1800 calories in total across the entire trip, which seems to check out with what the USDA tested (1,360 calories in a 10 lb melon).",

I did make a rather rough bow drill kit, but unfortunately using only rocks to shape your kit was very error-prone for me, and I ran out of time on the trip. I did keep working on the kit using only the same primitive means afterwards, and I was able to achieve fire with an extra 3:45 min of work. So clearly my primitive-only bow drill still needs a lot of work, but at least I was on the right track.",

As long as you keep water/snow from falling on you, you don't need to build up a thick wall/roof - a tarp would do and it sets up in minutes.  The #1 cause of heat loss by far is conduction, and that is through contacting the ground.  What would have helped (i've learned from past experience) is to layer the mattress you are building.  The varying layers of materials will produce insulating properties.  Heck, even some fallen logs seen in that pic can be layed out to help keep your body from leeching heat onto planet earth.",

Stack it as high as possible as it will compress over time.  The idea is to trap air between the layers rather than making a single solid surface.  Body heat loss is due to transfer of heat, and solid surfaces will transfer heat better.  Sleeping mattresses have air pockets mixed in the material and can stave off conduction.",

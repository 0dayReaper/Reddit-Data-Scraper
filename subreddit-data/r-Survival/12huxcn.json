I\u2019ve got a three year old tomato tangle in my rental\u2019s back yard, and I can\u2019t go for a walk without tripping over carrots and fennel. Versus three months of ice and bare trees in Western New York.\n\nAnd New Zealand was shockingly hard compared to what the early M\u0101ori knew from elsewhere in Polynesia.

The parts of the world that developed global empires, well, it\u2019s partly because they couldn\u2019t produce enough domestically to keep everybody alive (definitely not the only variable, but it\u2019s one of them). Places that have a long track record of stable indigenous cultures with medium-low low levels of organization are where people can survive most easily. These are mostly low lattitude, coastal, warm temperate to subtropical. Move it a few degrees further from the equator (because climate change) and you\u2019re in the sweet spot. \n\nThe southeastern US, central and upper South America, the Pacific Northwest, Pacific islands, parts of India and Southeast Asia (though those areas are pretty crowded) are your best bet. Avoid the middle of big continental landmasses, as they tend to be arid. Jungle and rainforest are only hospitable if you know the area well, otherwise there are too many hazards. And remember that humans are biologically adapted to the tropics\u2014 we handle heat much better than cold.  For all the worry about heat stress and climate change, there\u2019s still nowhere in the world too hot for us, if we can find water, shade, and moving air.",

Unfortunately harvesting is a bit of a chore, I'm not fit enough to climb the tree and my ladder isn't tall enough so I need to get my brother to do it - then we have delicious coconut for a few days before they spoil. In a survival situation, I would totally be motivated climb a coconut tree every few days - which after a month or two would make me fit enough to do it easily.\n\nA lot of tropical plants are like that, which is unfortunate. We have some amazing fruit that some people are willing to pay a fortune to have it picked from the farm and delivered immediately by air to their city. Some of them spoil after just a few hours.",

As far as the former, like surviving as long as possible before tapping out, then pretty much anywhere in my neck of the PNW. Preferably lower latitude, low elevation, and on or near a decently large lake, in late Spring or Summer. The majority of my skills and knowledge are tailored to the PNW, because I live here. I'm relatively sure I could survive a good while if I didn't have any big surprises like injury or extreme weather. \n\nAs far as resources, we have half a million miles of river and over 20,000 lakes. So tons of fish. Fish are an amazing resource, since they come to you. You can scale up operations, setting multiple lines/traps/nets. You don't even really necessarily need to actively supervise your lines either, you can be doing other stuff and just listening to for the bell or watching the float/bobber. Other than that, being near water is great because you can scout for game trails leading to watering holes. Set your traps, and check them a couple times a day. Finally, lots of edible plants and mushrooms if you know where to look. Some folks might disagree, but in my opinion the wilderness of the PNW in late Spring and Summer is probably the most bountiful wilderness on the planet just looking at bare resources. \n\nHow long I could go really depends on what is in the survival kit, and how lucky I am.",

Keep researching, you'll be shocked at what is probably growing around you that is edible or medicinal.  That said, it's hard to get enough calories from plants.  You really need sugary fruits, fatty nuts, and starchy roots for the calories. \n\n When I  was wondering where I could be self-sufficient in the US, I figured central Florida would allow me to grow high calorie plants year round and have an aquaponics setup without climate control.  Of course, that's not exactly the survival situation you were asking about.  For survival, I'd ask to be dropped in the area that I live because I know it's resources the best, then I would slowly starve to death because I suck at fishing and have no trapping skills.  I've watched a lot of Alone too lol :\u2060-\u2060\\",

I know in alone one contestant was catching fish but ended up going home because his diet wasn't diverse enough and wasn't getting enough of some mineral (something like that). I think about that a lot because before watching it I thought he was doing great! lol. It's made me think that just hunting by itself might not be enough to stay healthy.",

They deliberately choose a drop off date that makes it extremely hard to survive. One bear is several months of food, and they're relatively easy to kill with just a harpoon (or a trap - or both).\n\nIf, for example, they were allowed to trap/kill a polar bear... even being dropped off in the arctic circle during winter wouldn't be so bad. They could spend all their time on shelter and just rely on catching a bear.",

My fire starter would be a ferro rod as there are lots of birch trees which have bark that can easily be lit.  I'd bring fish hooks as fish will help me sustain weight better than squirrels and rabbits.  I can cut thin sections of tarp off and use it as line.  Worms are abundant and will be used as bait.  If this is long term I would have a much easier time making a bow and a couple arrows rather than solid fish hooks that will last a long time.  If I'm trying to escape the wilderness and find rescue it is quicker to stay along a lake and fish rather than walk around a forest hoping to not scare off game while carrying a bow that requires close shots.",

Every winter until 2 years ago has been filled with 2 feet of snow but not anymore.  The most I had at one time this winter was 6 inches which was nothing compared to the max 2 years ago which was around 3 feet.  This winter we did get a day where the high was 14F which was a little frosty but wasn't that bad.  In the winter before that we had about 3 days of 10F weather.  The low that season was -5F and this season we got a low of around 10F.  I know that sounds cold but with a proper shelter and lots of firewood it wouldn't be too bad.  In other comments you said this was long term so I would assume I'd have a shelter with room for a small fire.  I would say in winter we average highs around 40F with a few days in the 50s.  Average temp is probably around 35F.  I know it sounds cold but with good clothing it's very manageable and quite comfortable.  Weather is based off of north jersey.",

I'd definitely recommend getting a guide for your region, but also reading up on possible dangerous look-alikes before you start eating random plants you found in a book. \n\nAlso, you should look up and find out what the water indicator trees are for your region. You'd be surprised how much easier it makes finding water from a distance. River birch is a common one near me, and it really stands outs from a distance away.",

They can certainly help with calorie needs, but the best source of that will be from meat.  Wild forage will be good for vitamins.  If you are in a short term survival situation, vitamins from plants won't be too high up on the priority list.  There are exceptions, but you probably won't find anything too calorie dense until the fall and winter when most plants go to seed and start storing energy in their roots.  As for things that we cultivate that you might be familiar with, like potatoes, prepare to be disappointed with wild varieties as they tend to be woodier.  I highly recommend learning how to id plants and becoming familiar with them, but if you are learning for the main purpose of meeting caloric needs in a survival situation, then mushroom ID might be the better thing to learn.",

I now live in SEAsia and it's amazing how much fruit is available year-round, and that's not even getting into how epic coconuts are hahaha.  \nObviously, I'd prefer a spot with a freshwater spring, but there's usually a spot of rain near every 24 hours (even in the dry season) that one could collect water from. A nice lagoon/sandy bay would also be a huge perk for fishing and digging up shellfish. Cassava is like the tropical potato (and even makes for a healthier alternative to potato chips that are both delicious and a bit denser with a solid crunch). I'd probably take me months to build a strong enough boar trap though. I wouldn't wanna try taking one of those bastards on in a fair fight hahaha",

Theres lots of wildlife lots of rivers with plenty of fish and water lots of edible floral life lots of wood and besides the occasional rain, that most other locations with good food and water supply would also get, the weather now would be pretty nice. Rain also would not be too big of a deal because it all runs off the hills and gets caught in the trees and it wouldn\u2019t take long to set up a decent enough shelter to keep the rain off of you pretty well. The smokies are just off the Appalachian mountains and with lows probably around freezing and not under it would definitely be manageable. If i got to choose to do it in summer it would be the perfect place because theres lots of cover from the sun and its not too hot but it would be comfortable all day and night",

            "comment": "I'd choose where I grew up in Australia, mostly because I know it.\n\nIt was a dry area (there can be zero rain from mid fall to late spring) near a ridge line that did have rain all year so there was reliable water flowing down from the hills.\n\nNot sure if you're watching the current Alone season of Australia... most of this country isn't that hard to survive. I'm pretty sure the biggest problem they're facing is most animals in the rainforest hide (and sleep) in the trees all day. Hunting at night is nearly impossible unless you use traps, and trapping is restricted because there are so many critically endangered (and protected) animal species there.\n\nHunting isn't my thing, I'd prefer to grow vegetables, but where I grew up because water was only available in a few places it's pretty easy to find animals. Only very small animals can survive without going down to the river for a drink regularly.\n\nThe climate was also pretty ideal. Cold enough in winter to want a fire to keep you warm but only for comfort, not survival. Summers were brutal in the heat of the day, you definitely didn't want to spend more than a few seconds in the sun, but as long as you're in the shade or even better go for a swim it was fine and really only like that for a few hours a day and a month or so each year (that would bring rain, and rain cools everything down).",

When I lived there, I grew bananas, papayas, basil, and aloe vera, and that was without trying. The papaya tree just grew after I cleaned one out and threw the skin and seeds out my back window.  \n\n\nIF you are talking about long-term survival, you will want to be able to not only forage, hunt and fish. but also to practice animal husbandry, and farming.",

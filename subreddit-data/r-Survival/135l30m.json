    "postText": "I don't comment on these threads because im too European to bother about predators, but I have a healthy understanding for firearms. Whenever the NA part of this sub gets onto the topic of personal protection against predatory animals, there is a noticeable clique of people who think firearms are not a reasonable last resort or back up. \n\nIs the opposition to it a cultural thing, like how some people think they are better than other people &amp; will never own a firearm? Or is it a practical reason? I'm not trying to stir the pot, im genuinely interested.\n\nFrom my POV, if you are hiking in an area of predatory animals why would you just want bear spray? What is the major issue with having a backup, even if bear spray works 9/10 times what if while hiking the can depressurise or you lose it?",

            "comment": "Culture war aside, there's also a strong \"less is more\" style of elitism in this sub (and the hiking and backpacking sub), a \"no true Scotsman\" argument if you will. \n\nIf someone says they carry a lighter at all times someone will pop in and say \"you can't always depend on having a lighter, that's what I never carry one. If I need fire I make a bow drill on the spot so I'm always practicing friction fire and don't have to carry a lighter\". \n\nIf someone says \"I carry an extra emergency snickers bar in my truck\" someone will chime in with \"You don't need food for 40 days, food is literally the last thing I'd want if I were in a survival situation\". \n\nIf someone asks for a recommendation for a \"survival\" knife they're bound to get answers like \"You don't need some giant Rambo knife! I survived a flood for 40 days and 40 nights on an ark I built with my Swiss Army Classic\". \n\nAnd so it goes with guns. You ask about guns you're going to get answers like \"It's just dead weight and don't forget to file the front sight off because guns are useless against anything. I live in an area with Polar, Grizzly, Kodiak Grizzly, Black, Panda, and Teddy bears and only carry my dry wit to deal with them\".\n\nLess is more is great, and for the most part no one can take knowledge away from you and knowledge is lighter than anything. However, just because you know how to Dulfersitz abseil doesn't mean you should leave your belay device at home.",

If the water was knee-deep and he was still building, he would gladly accept the saw and hatchet if offered to him....\n\nIf that bear was standing on his back and chewing on the back of his neck, he would accept the gift of a firearm or have the bear shot by a friend. \n\nLess is more, and the more you know, the less you have to carry!  I believe this wholeheartedly..  But when you're freezing to death, the bear is standing  on you, the water is coming up...  \n\nI was taught from a young age, always use right tool for the right job! I have ffdd up a lot of car parts and fix it jobs because I didn't have the right tool.  \n\nI will always strive to carry the right tool while in the woods. It's Survival!  It's not a game!  Life and death is not a fffnnn redit thread. \n\nIn some parts of the woods, there is a bigger threat from humans than predators, others its the other way around. Sometimes, the threat is freezing to death on a -30deg ice fishing trip, starving for calories on a long exhausting hike, or any other such situation I may get into.\n\nI go into the woods with the simple scenario in the back of my mind.  If I broke my ankle and couldn't walk out, how would I survive right here?  I have shelter, water, snacks, and a fire kit that is proven to work.  You see, it's not all about the romantic bushcrafter survival scenario. Survival situations usually come with some complications, weather, injury, predator attack, and loss of direction.\n\nDon't let them get you down for your decisions. I come here for ideas and education. Not opinions.",

Heard coyote yipping and howling around us and heard rustling. Everyone yelled and screamed and ran towards the highway and when we looked back there was 4 or 5 coyotes standing at the edge of the Field. \n\nThey obviously just wanted us out of there but their point came across loud and clear. \n\nMy next close coyote encounter was a lone coyote while walking my small dog on some popular and well groomed trails just minutes from the city. He sticks pretty close so we decided to let him off leash despite the keep dogs on leash sign since no one else was down this trail at the time. Dumb idea. We spotted a coyote maybe 50 meters away at the tree line. My brave and stupid little 14 year old dog took of after him wailing and barking as best as he could. Next mistake was my partner panicking and running after him putting us in danger. At that point I decided to run after them yelling and making any noise I could while keeping my arms up to look big and intimidating hopefully. My little dog came back happy as ever and we swiftly carried him out and calmly power walked down the path while looking behind us. the coyote was following us out from a distance. Again a clear get the hell out message. We ended up forgetting which fork in the trail we took and got fairly lost. When the coyote stopped following and the sun started to set I decided we should go due West and cut through the woods because that would be the closest road. Within 10 minutes just before the sun went all the way down we made it to road and hitched a ride back to our car.\n\nThe last experience really upped the amount of stuff I bring on a hike. And take all park rules very seriously",

Number one reason I don't carry unless I'm actively hunting is that encounters are rare and mostly avoidable, [bear spray is more effective](http://www.bear-hunting.com/2019/8/firearm-vs-bear-spray), and guns are heavy. The linked study does show high effectiveness of pistols and long guns, but that bear spray works even better than guns do.\n\nI don't even hunt with bear spray, and I live in the mountains of southeast British Columbia where we have black bears, grizzlies, cougars, etc. If I make noise and manage my attractants wildlife encounters are of very little concern to me, even on multi-day through hikes deep in the wilderness.\n\nI have had a lot of encounters with bears, far more so on my property than out in the bush where bears tend to just run away, and rarely is the solution shooting the bear.

Now what's even funnier is that they don't know it.  A lot of them see the entire world as USA and that's about it.  Chances are they're probably pretty young too or have never traveled and seem the way the rest of the world works.\n\nSo that's it - yea, first off they like their guns.  I have 10 myself but I'm only a bit of a gun nut not hard core. For some of them ANY reason to walk around gunned-up is a good reason.  There are the yanks who like guns and then there's the yanks who just live and die for tacti-cool. \n\nYou also get a ton of spill over because the name of the forum is \"SURVIVAL\" and since most americans hate reading (grin) they don't read rule # 10.  So they're here to talk about their preps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to work at a gun club - but we were just a trap and skeet shooting club so we're not as macho as the guys in some of the gun stores here.  In fact we have one store in town that they're so over the top that the staff carry in the store, (it's als the only place they're allowed to play dress up too legally) and it's a bit of a joke to rest of the gun crowd in town.  So there are the rules, here in Alberta, IE: Canada we have guns too - lots of em, even more than Europe but we've come to grips with the rules and can happily live with them.  It's not like the states at all.  Granted we also have dipshits like Trudeau who are now currently trying to take some of them away.  Right now all handgun sales are off the table in Canada and their next rule wants to take my hunting buddy's guns who's a family doctor BTW, some of his fun guns (two AR-15's and his Tavor)  away, which is BS because they are fun !   Anyway ......\n\nYes Virginia, you can't carry your handguns anywhere but the range and your house for the most part and we would never consider taking them out to the woods.  A: they're fuggen useless against a bear (but easier to carry) and B: you'll never get a shot off properly on a full charge anyway and the C: is it's not legal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow would I know :\n\nSo I an a Cdn Firearms Instructor and I also used to do stuff with AHEIA, we teach bear awareness to the Conservation Officers for the province and also how to deal and dispatch bears.  The fave is a shotgun and one or two 00 buck and the rest slugs.\n\nAnyway the point is bear spray will do a better job than a handgun, it's just that simple.  It might also boil down to how much time do you spend in the outdoors.  For myself after 40+ years of canoe tripping and hunting in Alberta and backpacking and climbing on 4 other continents as well I'm more than \"pretty sure\" you don't need firearms in the woods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYep, I've met one or two other canucks who think you do and pack bear guns (crap assed Mossberg w/pistol grip) nothing fancy but then we also don't go camping with them.  TBH these guys mostly do front country stuff where you can drive to, so they don't really (IMHO) get out there so it's moot.  There's camping and then there's where the hell are we camping.  The rocky mtns and the real north is just a ways away.  Plus, we don't go out with people who are scared when they're in the woods - it's just not relaxing.  BTW - If you wanna know some bear safety here:  [https://aheia.com/products/1899-bear-essentials](https://aheia.com/products/1899-bear-essentials)\n\nFor example,  I'm driving to Tuktoyaktuk this Aug and even then I won't be talking a firearm and we'll be out camping most nights and river fishing everyday from Prince George to Watson Lake to Whitehorse to Dawson City to Inuvik and I'm not worried about the bears up there either.\n\nMaybe it's a mind set thing !?!   Again:  This a USA based website and forum so as usual:  \"Your millage and attitude may vary.\"  (grin)\n\nIf you wanna talk more about it, we can but I mean by that, actually talk.  I'm not gonna change my opinion about firearms when camping but we can kick it around but if you just wanna play troll don't bother.",

If I ever get to where I'd like to try backpacking for more than one night at a time, I'm going to invest in a firearm and go to a shooting range to learn how to handle it. I'd rather be uncomfortable and nervous learning how to do something new, than alone in the woods miles from civilization and being attacked by a bear or a mountain lion.

Number one the gun is much heavier than the bear spray and takes up more space, which is a concern when backpacking. If I\u2019m in grizzly country, I would need a very large handgun like a 500 SW for it to be effective and even then it may not be. Reason number two, bear spray is more effective in stopping grizzlies and other large predators than guns. Not my opinion there are peer reviewed studies to back this up. I just use the thing that is more effective and more practical.",

Both groups think the other groups are idiots.\n\nAs another user has pointed out \u2013 lots of professionals working in areas with predators don't carry themselves, and their general opinion is that spray and bells are more effective than firearms. \n\nFirearms are heavy, they can miss, most people probably don't have the training to calmly fire on a bear that's charging them and actually hit it in a way that stops the threat \u2013 some people definitely train enough for this, but it's the same as that few guys in a sportscar can do fast laps on the track, few guys who like running can run a sub 3 marathon, few wrestlers are actually competitive outside their local region etc., we'd all like to think we're that guy, but we're probably not. ;)\n\nObviously people disagree with that and carry anyways for the extra protection. I think in the US there is especially a fear of other people, which is the basis for \"everyday carry\". That also makes people who don't carry pretty nervous... because they're worried they might encounter a paranoid person with a gun in the woods.\n\n  \nKeep in mind as well that there are alot of English-speaking voices coming from countries with firearms cultures different from the United States \u2013 i.e. Canada, Australia, UK, or just Europeans/Rest of World folks writing in English. These folks obviously have a very different perspective, and are more likely to be against carrying firearms in the woods for protection because it's just not done in their countries at all.",

            "comment": "It is virtue signalling over logic plus a bit of (self-imposed) lack of basic life skills.  \n\n\nMany urbanites know skills that serve them well daily (navigating the bus/subway system, knowing the best tapas restaurant &amp; martini bar, etc) but only inside the urban bubble. They can't drive and because they are surrounded by police, CCTV, and additional legal restrictions on their lives...they perceive they don't need self-defense weapons (non-lethal or gun/knife). They imagine that contrary to statistics, they are pretty well protected and that most criminals follow the same laws/ideologies they do. It works for them, until it doesn't. Then they move to the suburbs, country, or a Red State (not that I'm bitter but I'm in an area SWARMED by Chicago/LA/NJ-NYC refugees and most fled the same things).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOut of lack of opportunity/need and cultural pressure, they have ZERO comfort (training or even exposure) basics such as raising animals, growing things, canning, fishing/hunting, self-defense (animals or human criminals), mechanical repair, etc. They have evolved to match their urban setting.\n\nJust like when I go into a large city and can't figure out subway or wander into the \"wrong\" part of town (ignoring all the \"obvious\" signs and people knowing not to go there) when an urbanite goes into the country, he has a Disney view of animals (\"hi little rattle snake...good morning Mr Bear!\") as well as a lack of self-reliance with regard to criminals. They don't realize there's not CCTV watching and a cop within 45sec at all times...maybe not even 45 minutes. They apply their unique (I'd say odd/naiive) worldview and skillset to another context out of a weird belief that someone from NYC knows how to navigate the Rocky Mountains, most of Alaska, or Yemen. Not long ago, I was in the Smoky Mtns and rock hopping up a cool river there. Some tourists (I would say NY but admittedly most Northern accents sound similar to me - but it was \"something strongly North Eastern and not Bahstan\") were harassing a mother bear &amp; cubs, sending their kids over with food and stupid fat dad chasing around with a camera. I know when the bear (rightly) bites the kid's hand off, the bear will be put down so I an my friend started making noise and scared the bear off. The angry tourists were like \"ruined our picture, bear would not hurt us\" and if it weren't for the bear ending up dead...I regret saving that family from their own urbanite/Disney stupidity.\n\nIn short, it is an extension of their narrow and isolated worldview, having only seen non-NYC on TV and oddly believing animals are all sweet (\"awwww it's a shark...Nature Channel said they don't want to harm me...\") and that violent criminals live in some OTHER part of town or that somewhere within 30sec is a NYPD officer to save them. Just basic ignorance.",

            "comment": "TBH most of my carrying involves Bear spray and it's to protect my 12 lb pooch from bigger aggressive dogs with irresponsible owners.  Wherever my dog goes so goes the Bear spray.  Effectiveness,  legality,  less overall damage as in no loss of life, ease of use. The pistol is the backup in my case and I don't always take it. \n\nOthers carrying isn't an issue to me generally,  some have a cowboy mentality I guess,  I've seen that but I also know totally rational people who I respect that carry,  and that's anywhere they go. Consistently carrying (without having my dog with me) is often more effort than I care to put forth.",

You don\u2019t need a gun because bear spray works argument is fair till you end up spraying a bear in the face and the can is empty and he comes back at you\u2026 best is to avoid the conflict in the first place best as possible but there are places I don\u2019t go unless I pack a gun because I know I am at bottom end of the food chain. I never had to use it but had situations where I chambered and was at ready because the bear I though ran away doubled back and was trying to sneak up",

Not to mention, I spend a lot of time in the Arizona Desert and forests. \n\nWe have lots of snakes, Mountain Lions, Jaguars, Bears, wolves, bob cats, javelinas, coyotes the size of German shepherds, and more. (The Gila Monsters, Rattle Snakes, Scorpions and tarantulas are more common and fortunately move on\u2026 The Tarantulas are actually very passive and chill.. like the Weed smoking hippy of the desert.. Mating season is pretty cool\u2026 so many of them) \n\nI\u2019ve personally seen A lot of rattle snakes, a few Gila Monsters, A lot of Bears, handful of Javelina and Bob Cats, impressive amount of Coyotes (they have jumped our 6\u2019 fence into our yard and they are German Shepard Size with very little fear of humans) one Mountain Lion, no Jaguars but I know people south of Tucson that have, and no wolves although they are in AZ.  \n\nFurthermore, some parts of my state are known pathways for human trafficking and drug running. Basically up the Gila River along Ajo, Gila Bend and into Phoenix along the west side near Maricopa, Buckeye, White Tanks.  A lot of bodies are found there and a lot of people go missing because they saw something they shouldn\u2019t have. \n\nI\u2019ve been camping in the desert with my family and kids when we\u2019ve seen bands of people walking with \u201ccoyotes\u201d who have guns. This was just north of Gila Bend. They were a few miles away but saw them with the binoculars. \n\nIn the past, We\u2019ve stopped and handed out water when we\u2019ve been off-roading in the area but that\u2019s risky \ud83e\udee3\ud83d\ude2c You don\u2019t want someone to jump out and relieve you of your vehicle and your life. It\u2019s hard to not stop when you see people out there and you know it\u2019s too hot to be walking through the desert. \n\nYou can call Border Patrol or the cops but you\u2019re 90-120 min from civilization at a minimum. And that\u2019s if you\u2019re able to communicate a precise location or coordinates. It\u2019s a big desert, lots of mountains and lots of land. \n\nThe amount of clothing, water bottles and trash that has accumulated in the desert is beyond impressive.. \n\nit looks like the night after Burning Man if there were no trash cans and no one picked any trash\n\nThe amount of garbage is depressing\nI truly, Love, respect and enjoy the beauty of nature\u2026 bummer that it\u2019s being destroyed",

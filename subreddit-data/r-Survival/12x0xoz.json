            "comment": "I've got a weird hobby. If I see an interesting ship or airplane, I look at what emergency equipment they are required to carry. So I know a lot about airplanes and their emergency equipment and life rafts in particular. I know a little bit about lifeboats and life rafts aboard US flagged vessels. So this is where the below information comes from.\n\nWhat would Tom Hanks do?\n\nIf you had a boat stop working, first you'd make sure the boat is safe and not going to get swamped (turn into the waves, etc). Then you'd attempt to fix whatever is wrong with the boat if possible. So you'd need a tool kit, knowledge, and spare parts. (I've been on boats that broke down - spare parts and tools are essential!)\n\nLet's assume that fails. You now are adrift in a boat that doesn't work, but otherwise has all the supplies you started out with. You'd get on the radio, try the SPOT, try the EPIRB, GPS locator, whatever. You need knowledge of what the emergency communications capabilities are on the boat. Stay with the boat unless it sinks. Do whatever you can to signal other ships (use flares, etc).\n\nNext, let's assume that didn't work and a storm swamped the boat and it is now sinking. You're going to need a lifeboat or raft, and the emergency equipment that comes with it (should already be aboard). Your boat should also have a Bail-Out-Bag, also called an Abandon Ship Bag. Grab it, and a life jacket while you're at it. Take whatever emergency supplies you also have aboard the boat, including extra fresh water or desalination equipment if you have time.\n\nThe raft or lifeboat will have some equipment on it already. This is required. Inventory it and make sure you know how to use it. Again, try any radios or emergency satellite communications or beacons that are available. Keep the signal flares handy if you see nearby ships. Now it's just a matter of day-to-day survival until you get picked up or beach onshore somewhere. Maybe that'll be inhabited or maybe you will be the next Gilligan's Island.\n\nPreserve water and ration it. Use desalination equipment if you have it, to make more fresh water. Capture rain water. Cover yourself to prevent sunburn and exposure. Use sunblock and lip balm if you have it. Ration the food and follow the instructions to try and eat 1100 calories per day of the life raft rations. You will lose weight rapidly, but you will stay alive for a long time this way. Conserve your strength and try and rest as much as possible. Catch fish or birds if you can.\n\nThe big one is water. The next big one is signalling for help. You should have redundant ways of communication and emergency beacons and so forth, and know how to use them. Remember that two is one, and one is none. That's what happened to Tom Hanks when he lost the survival kit on his life raft.\n\nNow let's pretend that he didn't lose the survival kit. Let's pretend that you have the same raft he did. Here's what you should expect:\n\nLIFE RAFT, EAM T-6\n\nRated capacity: 6 persons\n\nOverload capacity: 9 persons\n\nAccording to FAA-TSO-C70a Type II specification, the survival kit must contain the following items at a minimum:\n\n    CO2 automatic inflation system, inflates in 10 seconds\n    Water-activated locator light (automatically switches on when the raft hits the water)\n    TSO 406 ELT emergency locator transmitter with batteries\n    Bailing bucket\n    Buoyant knife\n    2 sponges\n    Mini Maglite Flashlight with batteries and spare bulb\n    Canopy\n    Compass\n    75\u2033 Tie Down Cord\n    Fishing Kit\n    Raft Repair Kit\n    Signal Kit (Mirror, Whistle, Dye Maker, Signal Flag)\n    Food Rations\n    Desalinator Kit\n    Survival Manual\n    Canopy Mast\n    Paddle\n    Radar Reflective Blanket\n    Three red hand flares\n    Three orange smoke signals\n    A first-aid kit containing at least the following items:\n        12 adhesive bandages\n        6 gauze pads\n        2 rolls of adhesive tape\n        1 triangular bandage\n        1 sterile surgical blade\n        4 antiseptic towelettes\n        4 packets of burn ointment\n        4 packets of insect repellent\n        2 packets of aspirin\n        2 packets of motion sickness tablets\n\nThis is why it's important to go on those lifeboat drills and know where your emergency equipment is, and know what it is and how to use it. (Keep in mind that this is a life raft from the airplane in the movie, not your life raft on your boat. I have no idea what its requirements are.)\n\nNow that you know what's in that particular kit, what would you add to it to make life easier and more survivable?\n\nEDIT: Made a few inline edits to add things to the list.",

It helps to know exactly what is happening when you fly and you hear a strange noise, or you hit turbulence. I know about the redundant backup systems on airplanes, and what they do if one of the primary systems breaks down, and where the emergency equipment is located, and what is in them. It's all publicly available information - you just have to be curious enough to look it up.\n\nDid you know if you are flying in a Boeing 767 and all the engines and APUs fail, there is a separate way to generate emergency power to run the aircraft? You are flying along and all the sudden a little propeller windmill drops out of the bottom of the plane and generates electricity. It's called a Ram Air Turbine.",

And almost every sea rescue is documented for the last 100 years or so.\n\nPoon Lim survived over 4 months adrift at sea in a life raft after surviving his ship being torpedoed in WW2.\n\n3 teenage boys drifted over 500 miles off course over 50 days before being rescued in 2010 near Samoa.\n\nSteve Callahan survived 76 days at sea in an inflatable life raft. Though he did have time to gather supplies as his boat sank, including a speargun which he was successful at using to fish. He started a life raft company that makes rafts that are more durable than the one he had, which was only rated to stay together for 40 days, iirc.\n\nBut ya, youtube has a lot of docuseries about shipwrecks and survival at sea. The biggest thing is fresh water. Inflatable solar stills are a thing. Many life rafts have them. But they all should. They work well.  After that it's food, stock some MRE type meals. Otherwise you're looking for food, which would be fish or possibly birds. So a fishing kit with lures or some sort of bait would be a good idea as well.  Then flares and mirrors, and patch kits and rain gear, something to bail the raft with and catch rain water with, radio/emergency gps beacon.  Everything should be able to fit in a backpack and be stored above deck, near the life raft so it can be easily grabbed in an abandon ship situation.",

SPOTS suck  (grin)\n\nAnyway, so he had an HF radio on the boat and of course a working EPIRB so with all that we were golden.\n\nWe had a life raft on the boat as well and of course we all had \"ditch bags\" you were supposed to grab if things went south or in this case down.\n\nI bought a small Katadyn Survivor 6 desalinator and rations are/were in the life raft.  The ditch bag has bits in it and each guy made his own - I had a small solar panel kit and battery in mine from a Chinese company that would power my cell that was paired to the In Reach and the In Reach itself. Clothes, CDN Passport, ID, Back Bacon, Molson Canadian Beer, a Touque, etc, etc ...... you know the usual shit .....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat else do ya wanna know ? .... the skipper usually has all that stuff already setup on the boat, so you only bring a bit of stuff for your bag.\n\nThink about it for a second though in 2014 I was texting and chatting with friends from the middle of the fuggen ocean!!   And they could track us live ......\n\nThat's why survival these days:  ain't no thang girl!!\n\nIt's pretty sweet having these kinds of abilities, so if you do piss around a lot in the woods and don't have this kind of stuff or you don't rent it when you go out - ask yourself what's your ass worth to you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we were canoeing the Macken zee River many, many, moons ago we had shit, no radios, no such thing as a cell phones, no flare pens, no bear spray, and most of all no GPS, or Sat Phones  ..... we had bugger all.  They weren't invented yet.\n\nThese days the sky's the limit for outdoor stuff, so survival isn't quite as daunting as it seems to be.  But like we tell the students - cool, lookit the swell toys, aren't they pretty!!\n\nLooken at das blinken lights !  Vunderbar !\n\nNow once the battery barfs and its dead - you're now holding a very expensive brick in your hand, how's that worken out for ya?\n\nNext Step, please pull out your compass and topo map that you know how to use and let's get going .......",

Dude didn't poop for a couple weeks. It will totally block up your system.  And some people have tons of food, yet still get Ketosis.

Being able to backpack, carry lightweight food, cook, purify water, have shelter and stay warm, have first aid just in case and all that is a great bit of preparation skills and gear. With that you can be ok in the first period of emergencies where the power goes down, gotta evacuate etc.\n\nNext, like someone else mentioned consider the prepper focus - basically stockpiling supplies.\n\nSurvival skills come in when you get lost, separated from your whole backpack of gear, vehicle break down or any calamity where ideal preps have been removed and you\u2019re undersupplied.

Growing up on well water and a family that relied onhunting and fishing to pack the freezer, I'm continually surprised how many people don't know basic stuff. Citiots know canned food, bottled water, and medicine. For the first month it'll essentially be gang wars and free for all un urban and suburban areas. \n\nInitially, anything in easy proximity to towns and cities would be an absolute cluster. Over time it would bleed out to rural areas. But not many people have the will or knowledge to attempt a deep woods situation.",

Then do the math for today with a larger population and more guns.\n\nSecond, if you are withing 400 miles of a city; those people will be visiting you in the woods trying to survive. And along with them will come hunting deaths.  And along with them will come those who will kill you for what you have.\n\nLonger term, things like Lyme disease and other illnesses will make life a nightmare.\n\nLiving off the land after collapse is a fantasy.",

People weren't so dependant. \n\nThe general populace had a better idea, especially in rural areas. Wells were still common. Electricity still wasn't in a good percent of small towns.mostly major and middle size cities, and traffic corridors.\n\nSeptic tanks weren't common until the 1940s, so many homes in what are now suburban areas and rural areas still had outhouses.\n\nHandwashing clothing was still the norm.\n\nNowadays, I  wouldn't be surprised if die offs to starvation and contaminated water exceeded 40% of total population if people couldn't get clean water from the tap and grocery stores stopped getting regular deliveries. \n\nI think you have more faith in the abilities of modern 21st century Americans than I do.",

I would think a mountain spring has less chance of being impacted by runoff because it's upstream of almost every potential contaminant. On another note, a friend warned me that many North American streams recently have some kind of mold or bacteria that was spreading, but I can't verify that's not some rumor or misunderstanding he has.",

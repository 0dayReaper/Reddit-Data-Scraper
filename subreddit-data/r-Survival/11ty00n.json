    "postText": "I made this infographic. I find grouping tarp shelters by ridgeline type helpful.  You can't always find two trees to pitch between, so the diagonal or pole shelters are important to know.  Then just learn a few with \"features\" like built-in groundsheets, being closed on 3 sides or open and you can pitch pretty much anywhere to meet any conditions/needs.

The issue is that most people aren't going to carry a long pole into the wilderness.  And finding a long enough branch can be tricky -- especially one that's smooth so it won't rip your tarp.  For a long-term shelter, it would be worth it to shave a branch for this purpose.   Even then, you still need a LOT of extra rope to lash a pole onto a large tree.  Or a LOT of time to find a tree with a groove/branch at the exact right spot for propping the ridge pole onto.   Hence why rope ridgepoles are the best solution for short-term shelters.",

There can be literally tons of force on the rope, and a well placed ridgepole can reduce that down to almost zero.\n\nMy tarps have survived 100mph wind gusts. They wouldn't with a rope holding them up.",

I tried accounting for tye sun's movement and wind, and eventually ended up with something between a plowpoint and lean-to. It was a great learning experience and lots of fun.",

I say majority, because there's several other  scenarios:\n\n1. Bluff charges. From NPS: Bluff charges are more common.\nBluff charges are meant to scare or intimidate. When a bear bluff charges, it will have its head and ears up and forward. The bear will puff itself up to look bigger. It will bound on its front paws toward you (moving in big leaps), but then stop short or veer off to one side. Often bears retreat after a bluff charge, or they may vocalize loudly.\nIf you can see a bluff charge is about to happen, slowly back away while waving your arms above your head, and speak to the bear in a calm voice. When the bear charges you, hold your ground and stay calm. After the bear charges, slowly retreat while keeping an eye on the bear. Let the bear know that you\u2019re a human, and that you aren\u2019t a threat. Continue to speak to the bear in a calm voice and make it clear that you are a human.\nDo NOT run during a bluff charge, it may trigger the bear to attack.\u00a0Stand your ground. Be ready for the bear to make contact in case the charge is not a bluff charge. Know how to protect and defend yourself in case the bear turns aggressive.\nAggressive charges are very dangerous. Bears may yawn or clack their teeth, and pound their front paws on the ground while huffing\u2014these are warning signs. These behaviors indicate that a bear is stressed, and it may be getting ready to charge. It will have its head down and ears pointed back, and the bear will come at you like a freight train. Be ready to protect and defend yourself!\n\nIf a black bear charges and attacks you, FIGHT BACK WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE! Do not play dead.\u00a0Direct punches and kicks at the bear\u2019s face, and use any weapon like rocks, branches, or\u00a0bear\u00a0spray\u00a0to defend yourself.\n\n\n2. Encountering a mother and her Cubs. Back away slowly and if they do not notice your presence then quietly go back and if they notice, just follow the above advice. \n\n3. Diseased and desperate, habituated bears. Pretty self-explanatory. \n\n4. Surprised or Predatory black bears. \n\nI'm no expert on black bears. I had encounters with them and mountain lions. As with anecdotal experiences, it's important to educate yourself for animals in your region. The above scenarios **besides bluff charges** I personally, imo, consider them uncommon to rare. With uncommon being a mother amd her cubs, it's common during the spring though if going to 'untouched' territory. \n\n**From NPS on Firearms: Firearms are not recommended for stopping an attack.\u00a0Using a firearm during a bear attack may only worsen the attack. An injured bear will be more aggressive, especially during a fight. It\u2019s also harder to hit a charging bear with a firearm rather than bear spray, and a firearm can be dangerous to any hiking partners. While firearms have been effective at stopping an attack, they aren\u2019t recommended.\nWounded bears can be even more dangerous.\u00a0If a bear is wounded with a firearm, it can potentially be defensive or aggressive. This can put park rangers and other park visitors at risk if a wounded bear must be tracked down.\nFirearms are not a substitute for proper bear avoidance practices and knowing how to properly handle a bear encounter.\nBear spray is the recommended tool for self defense against a bear.**\n\n\nTldr: educate yourself before resorting to killing animal that whimpers at the sight of sound, for the most part.",

You don't have as much time as you think to pump off those rounds. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/cGzeyO3pGzw\n\nIf you notice in the Mythbusters video Jamie was able to close a lot of distance before Adam could get a shot off.  I'd argue Adam didn't have time to aim properly.  If Adam didnt hit something vital to the central nervous system Jamie was still going to stab him even after being shot.\n\nNow imagine a 500lb bear charging you that can run faster than a human.    I think getting a single shot off at even 30 to 40 yards is going to be hard against a bear.  Hitting something vital under 500lbs of muscle and fat is even harder.\n\nFor regular defense against humans it really depends on your comfort level.  However a good short barreled pump shotgun is hard to beat IMO.",

The question is how good of a shot do you think you are and how much arw you willing to practice.\n\nShort barreled shotguns are easier to handle (point and shoot) and allow buckshot to spread out over a shorter distance.  \n\nGo to a gun store and see if they have any courses for beginners.

He heard some rustling then crashing through the underbrush that he equated to the sound of a freight train barreling towards him. He lifted his 44 and emptied it towards the sound. He fired the last bullet into the bears left eyeball at point blank. The bear was pissed off at this point and proceeded to maul him for about 45 minutes. When the bear was good and ready finally laid down and died leaving my friend with a broken shoulder, arm, collar bone and about 300 odd stitches in various places. When he was skinning the bear out the next morning he found 5 dents in the bears skull where the bullets had bounced off as it was charging him. He had to pack up his camp and hike out to get help. One of the toughest bastards I\u2019ve ever known.",

I am terrified of one animal in north america and it is a polar bear. But as for all bears, avoiding them is best. Dont be quiet when walking through the woods. Bears mostly keep to themselves except for the fall and spring because they can be dangerous and hungry then. If you are making noise like singing to yourself or as corny as it sounds rolling with a bear bell on your pack they mostly go away, the exception being a mother bear. But seeing a cub is alarm enough to get the hell out of dodge. Most bear attacks happen when people are messing with bears or accidentally suprise them when walking through the woods.

I was camping on a small lake and had a fire going to make breakfast... heating up some bacon grease. A guy  at another camp site a good hundred yards away was yelling at me. I thought he was crazy until I looked behind me. The bear was close and he backed me right into the (extremely cold) lake. He then proceeded to rip up my food and completely empty a mayonnaise jar with his tongue. He never ate any of the meat, just mauled it. After he left it was several hours before I could feel my legs. Personally I think it was a world record size bear",

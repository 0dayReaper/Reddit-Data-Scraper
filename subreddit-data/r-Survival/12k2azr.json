It's why some of the door to door and TV knife salesmen claim they never need sharpening. Or how people who like them say they stay sharper longer. \n\nAnd when you do sharpen them you need something like a very small diameter rod or a triangle shaped rod that can slip in and out of the serrations.",

A good straight edge cuts bread perfectly. A serrated one tears at it and leaves crumbs all over the place. Yuck.\n\nThe \"never need sharpening\" angle is the only advantage of a serrated knife, and it's generally true - my ex girlfriend had one of those TV salesman knives and it was easily ten years old. It still cut a tomato just fine despite never having been sharpened and us just tossing it in the drawer with other knives and no blade cover, as well as washing it in the dishwasher almost every day.\n\nBut I bet even when it was brand new it didn't cut as well as a properly maintained and sharpened straight edge knife. It definitely didn't cut that well after ten years of abuse.",

Or maybe it snags as much with a larger rope too.\n\nIt's not true that it never needs sharpening. You're just brute force sawing it through whatever you're cutting. With a dull saw. Tomatoes are easy to cut with a rough edge. You can sharpen a butter knife with a coarse stone and that toothy rough edge will cut through a tomato. It won't be a clean cut of course, but it will do it.",

Smaller branches can just be snapped.  \n\nModern high carbon steels are very hard, and also brittle.  But you want this characteristics in a knife.  They are time consuming to sharpen, but don\u2019t need sharpening very often.  I\u2019ve found using a kit with diamond stones works best, like KME, for speed.  You won\u2019t get the polish of a natural stone but it will be just as sharp with 1/10th the time.\n\nSome folks have mentioned serrated for meat and bread.  A straight knife, if very sharp, does better.  Check around and you\u2019ll see all high end 4 piece steak knife sets over 500 USD are straight.  \n\nSerrated shreds things even when dull, while straight cuts. A knife is for cutting.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about the steel on the knives you mentioned, but check out the hardness scales.",

If your cutting fibers and ropes, bascily things that require a pull stroke to cut, serrated is best, it teeth are done in a way that enhance pull cuts, ((not gonna get into that but a quick Google or YT should give you tones of details. Plus some serrations are better than others)) but it sacrifices the effectiveness of the push cuts, and sharpening becomes a pain, and the edge retention is debatable because while the inner edge or the inside of the curve will probably roll slower due to lack of contact, the teeth will roll more due to the repeated use on them. Also some serrations are done to help with difficult cuts like bread. Take a bead knife anyday over a straight edge to cut loafs.",

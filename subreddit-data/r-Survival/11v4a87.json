After you\u2019ve rubbed some in, stretch the hide in every direction. Do this daily until it\u2019s as soft as you\u2019d like. \n\nThere are other ways of doing this and a ton of [videos on youtube](https://youtu.be/63Qt8BlfMac). Mostly \u201cbreaking\u201d the hide by hand is laborious, but with a squirrel hide it shouldn\u2019t take too long. \n\n[This](https://www.taxidermy.net/threads/338834/) seems helpful, too.",

So I bet it's about as hard as a rawhide chew toy.\n\nLil' oil and a lot of working it, should soften up fine. Fortunately squirrel is pretty thin in comparison to larger animals, so you should see progress relatively quickly.",

I was up there toward the end of summer and only had my wool blanket and I don't think I slept more than 15-20 minutes at may given time because I was trying not to freeze to death. And of course me being THE GENIUS that I am, doused the fire before going to bed because I was planning to leave in the morning and couldn't get it lit again during the night. So between pacing and shivering the entire night and trying to light the fire I had a miserable night. But lesson learned, don't forget your 0 degree down sleeping bags kids",

The former can even use pretty durable materials and still be light. There's no way to not be carrying a ton of unnecessary weight when your shelter is 6lbs, your pack (just the pack) is 5lbs and your sleeping bag/pad totals 5lbs.\n\nYou want to get to \\~3lb shelter, 2lb pack, 3lb bag/pad total.\n\nAn extra 8-10lbs makes a huge difference since water is heavy - carrying 3 liters will add almost 7lbs. Then add in food (also heavy), filtration system, clothes, electronics, and any luxuries and your joints will *certainly* notice the difference over multi-day hikes.",

That's 8lbs base weight for the big 4. Not even considering all the other stuff you need to bring like hydration system, kitchen, etc. \n\nI'm telling people that 8lbs is a good target since it'll put your base weight at around 15lbs typically. Not trying to sell UL, just warning against regretting buying a 4lb pack and a 6lb tent. Because you will regret that.",

Way too often one sees packs with multiple knives, axes and flashlights, but totally ill-prepared gear for shelter, sleeping, cooking and navigation.",

The guy who carried a sack with strings instead of a real backpack to safe a pound, the guy who went hiking in the mountains with sneakers instead of real boots, the guy who decided only to eat cold food for a week to safe the weight of any form of stove or burner or the guy who trimmed down his first aid kit until it was nothing more than 2 band aids and 2 tablets of ibuprofen.\n\nI am not saying the guys who carry 2 hatchets are better.

We try to never put the walls down because they are a pain to roll back up and it gets warm real quick. It\u2019s nice feeling the night time breeze. I would love to try the minimalist camping one year, it looks super fun. Otherwise I am a hammock or tent camper depending on where I camp.",

I guess it all depends on you and what you are comfortable  carrying. I've met alot of UL backpackers who are elitists. And expect to survive in the woods with hardly anything and criticize people who like me are prepared  for as much as I can be prepared  for. Hell I've met one guy who doesn't carry any weapons besides a pocketknife and no emergency  rations or water. I just don't get it, I grew up in the woods and my dad always said, if you are not prepared  you get what you deserve.",

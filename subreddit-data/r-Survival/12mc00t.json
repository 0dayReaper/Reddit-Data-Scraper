    "postText": "Hey All,\n\nI wanted to ask the community a few questions regarding a potential survival course I might be putting together in the future. To the mods, this is not an advertisment, just gauging interest!\n\nSome backstory on myself, I work as a professional mountain guide in Utah, Wyoming, Alaska, and Colorado, taking clients up technical summits via rock climbing, mountaineering, and backcountry skiing. I hold a wilderness first responder and a PRO 2 avalanche certification. I spend roughly 150 days a year in the field, working in technical high-mountain terrain.\n\nI have this vision of putting together a survival course focused on the high mountains. At the moment, the topics I'm envisioning covering would include rope work, technical alpine terrain travel, rock climbing, mountaineering, an included wilderness first aid cert, mountain hunting &amp; fishing, shelter building, avalanche awareness, and mountain fitness. This would be a week long course. Basically an in-depth training in high mountain survival.\n\nThe folks that have expressed interest in teaching would be myself, another fully licensed international mountain guide, a well known Alaskan hunting guide, and a wilderness medical professional. \n\nI'd love to hear if folks think this would be an interesting concept? Is there a need or desire for this type of thing in the world of wilderness survival? I thought it could be an interesting offering for a wide spectrum of folks, from hunters to mountain climbers to those with a passion for survival &amp; bushcraft. \n\nThanks everybody!",

            "comment": "This is definitely something that I feel like people would be interested in; but the idea does bring up some questions/concerns. I have taken a few different survival/outdoor courses (mostly through the pathfinder school) and feel like I could offer some more input than someone who has no \"formal\" woods training. \n\n\nThe 3 main questions that I have are probably the same as most people. \n\n1. When you stated it would be a week long course, what exactly does this entail; 5 days, 7 days, maybe even 10 days? I feel like there is far too much content for a single course, especially if you have students that are falling behind. For example a red cross wilderness first aid certification requires a minimum of 16 hours if the student already has cpr/aed certs; this alone would be 2 days of class time and should be left as a separate course. I also feel that the basic survival portion of the\u00a0 course should be around 3 days (as other schools do); this may not leave much time in the week for other activities, and don't forget a rest day if is a 4-5+ day course. \n\n2. What is the anticipated cost of this course? I feel something in the $600-800 range for a 4-5 day course is appropriate. If the course is around 7-10 days I feel that $1200-1500 would be the upper limit for most people. Definitely don't sell yourself short but don't deter too many people to be able to keep a decent flow of students.\n\n3. What is the anticipated location of this course? Do you have your own property that this will be done on, or will it be more of a guide style trip on public lands. From the list of states you work out of I feel that Utah/Wyoming/Colorado would be good, and alaska would be too far to travel for most people. You will have to consider what people will spend on the course plus cost of travel to/from course location plus cost of lodging before and after the course if needed. \n\n\nI am sure there is more I could add but this is\u00a0 already long enough. Let me know if you want to hear more or want an outside source to bounce ideas off.\n\nEDIT: For clarity. Everything was a jumbled mess",

I was envisioning something like a 7-8 days course as I think most folks could manage that with work, likely close to 10 days in total with personal travel. I'd be curious to try out a different format of a WFA, something that stretches over the course of four days, potentially even evening sessions after the day of class. But nixing it all together could be in the cards too. \n2. I'd suspect this would be a bit closer to the $1200-$1500 range given the length of time &amp; other provided things including food &amp; materials. Thinking this would be a 2x a year event rather than monthly course as all the instructors work near full - time in their adjacent professions.\n3. Likely held in Utah, Colorado or Washington and run in the typical fashion of commercial operations on public land. Alaska would be quite cool but I agree, very limiting for folks.\n\nThanks again, much appreciated.",

                            "comment": "I think the 7-8 days with a price range of $1200-1500 is perfectly acceptable. Since it is a twice a year event, what is the anticipated class size? Some other schools cap their courses at 12-20 people depending on how technical the course is versus the number of instructors. You had listed the possibility of having 3 guides/instructors, which may hinder your ability to help any students who are having trouble. \n\nIs this going to be the only course you offer, or will you have some shorter/more specific courses? Will you have any prerequisites for the course, as this will greatly aid you in not having to teach the absolute basics and instead just briefly go over them; but will also limit the type of student that is eligible. \n\nDo you have an idea of what gear will be required for students to bring (that could possibly be financially prohibitive for beginners); or will you offer rental gear for beginners to use that don't want to make that jump quite yet?\n\nNow, while I personally would love a 7-8 day course of this nature, many may not, I do believe you should start your business with a few shorter (and cheaper) more technically specific courses; or possibly an online course or youtube channel just to help get your name out there. I have done some courses through the Pathfinder School and a surprising amount of students are from across the country who found the school via youtube.",

When you said that you could possibly add the WFA to an evening session after the day class; what are you thinking as far as class scheduling? Are you thinking it will be 7-8 days of 8am-5pm or something more? \n\nThe courses that I have taken that were considered \"low intensity\" were 8ish-5ish; but my survival/high intensity courses were \"24 hour\" classes. They did not have a start or stop each day; at one point in a higher level survival course: you were running a nav course at 2am, while collecting natural materials for the next day, while keeping an ember alive, after not having eaten or slept for nearly 36 hours. \n\nI feel the second scenario is better for a survival course because if you can't do it then, you sure as hell won't be able to do it when injured and it actually matters.",

Like beginner for people with some previous experience, intermediate then will build upon skills and concepts taught in the beginner course, and finally and advanced course that could cover basically the same stuff as a guide certification but you don't get the cert (I would personally use it as a prep course for the guide certification course).",

It's not really useful to stick your head in the sand on this fact, it needs to be part of the plan from the beginning or they're just doomed to fail. And, I mean they are asking for our help, aren't they?",

He works as a guide already so he already knows about liability insurance, he has to have his own coverage as a guide in addition to the coverage of any company he works for. You claim that this doesn't sound like a new business concept to you, so clearly other people have gotten insurance for similar businesses in the past. Other than cost there shouldn't be any excessive barriers for OP starting what you claim to be a concept that has already been explored. \n\nAlso he's not asking us for business advice, he asking if we would be interested in paying for services like what he wants to offer and if we've ever done or heard of anything like what he has outlined. He's asking for course content advice, not small business owner advice. At least not here, I'm sure he has trusted bosses and friends who can give him advice applicable to the actual state he lives in and not \"woah bro, your insurance must be really high\".\n\nWhich brings me to my third point, you saying \"your insurance must be high\" isn't advice of any kind. You've just brought negativity and nothing else to this discussion. You didn't offer and help or advice, it's criticism and not the constructive kind.",

Also beware they often have pretty unrealistic restrictions mostly to protect certain local animal species.\n\nIn the recent Tasmania season for example, they have to use non-lethal traps and they have to make sure animals are not caught in those traps for long before being identified and potentially released if they're an endangered species. That makes survival a lot more difficult than in a real survival situation.\n\nStill - a lot you can learn from watching Alone.",

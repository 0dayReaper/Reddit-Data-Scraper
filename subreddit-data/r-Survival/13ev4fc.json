I never forgot the section in the back for tsunami it was very short - \u201c*If you can see it coming*, it\u2019s too late - but run like heck anyway.\u201d   I imagine that chapter has been updated, after the 2 terrible catastrophic tsunami that have occured since then.  \n\n But the First Aid part where it said to use SuperGlue for bad cuts - VERY useful, and I did that quite a few times, on myself &amp; other travellers in remote rough areas.  Just ensure it\u2019s clean deep down before glueing (they recommend to clean the wound out with toothbrush if there is much debris) , and to use caution glueing if you can see tendons or whatnot. \n\nHighly recommend.",

Bandaging it and getting out to get sanitary irrigation and proper stitches is preferable.\n\nThe risk of \"sealing in\" bacteria and contaminants and having an infected wound is pretty high, especially since antibiotic ointments tend to dissolve the adhesive.\n\nIf you *must* carry superglue, at least carry a skin adhesive like Dermabond, and also consider packing an irrigation syringe.",

It's also more flexible when cured. You can even use it in your mouth.\n\nThis is important when you're putting it in your skin.\n\nSterile surgical \"sutures\" (all-inclusive) are still almost always a better option for serious wounds than screwing it up yourself in the dirty backcountry.",

Super glue will work but as you mentioned, it\u2019s stiff and doesn\u2019t flex naturally and isn\u2019t formulated for skin.  Dermabond also has an antiseptic quality to it. I\u2019d go with dermabond or similar formulation but in a get-up-and-go environment, casualty needs to come in on foot, where the hospital is the next stop, super glue could be used in the right context, knowing that antibiotics are inevitable.  I wouldn\u2019t use it for eviscerations.  It\u2019s not ideal but if that\u2019s all you have\u2026 I actually cut the hell out of myself, went to the hospital for a quick peak and a tetanus booster and the nurse there literally told me that next time I should just use super glue.  I don\u2019t think that was the most sound advice but he\u2019s the nurse.  I had him give me some steristrips and some single use Dermabond.  The two always go in my backcountry first aid kit but I have used steristrips in combination with benzoin tincture liberally and to great success on multiple lacerations throughout my stint as a medic.  That combo is still my favorite for non-invasive wound closure.",

Of course I have some medical training so I understand disinfecting and sanitary conditions. I notice you keep saying sterile, sterile means the absence of life.

She had little money and no transportation, but plenty of determination. In the three years that followed, Alling walked all the way to Dawson City, Yukon, crossing the North American continent on foot. She walked across the Canadian landscape, weathering the baking sun and freezing winter, crossed the rugged Rocky Mountains and hiked the untested wilderness of British Columbia and the Yukon. Finally, on a make-shift raft, she sailed alone down the Yukon River from Dawson City all the way to the Bering Sea",

Maybe bring some supplies or treats for his/her lessons.     \n\nAny decent book on survival will include a chapter about psychology.  It's arguably the most important aspect of survival.  The problem is that YOUR psychology in any survival situation will be different from mine.  So the books can't really give due credit to this aspect.  Only by trying, failing, hurting, and coping, can you learn this stuff.   Books are pretty much only for the author.  Even the best handbooks are meant to be field guides... Any survival book that gives the illusion of success without attempts and failures is a scam.  You simply cannot learn this stuff from the comfort of your home.",

He pretty much found everything he needed to live as well as he possibly could in the circumstances in the ship wreck.  It's a fantasy version of survival really where you just happen to have everything you really need handily land in your lap.\n\nIt's still a fun read though Crusoe being a very religious slave trader is interesting from a modern perspective.",

Mindset &gt; skillset &gt; toolset. It doesn\u2019t matter what gadget you possess, if you don\u2019t know how to use it, or are willing to use it. Mindset finds a way when the tool breaks. \n\nLearn how to effectively lead, delegate, deescalate emotions, and solve problems. \n\nFor deeper dive into staying \u201ceven keeled\u201d during stressful times learn and practice some stoicism, (which many people get wrong). It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t feel anything or become robotic, but rather allow yourself feel for a moment, understand why you feel that way, adjust as required, and get back to work. \n\nMeditations by Marcus Aurelius \nLetters - Seneca\nDiscourse - Epictetus\n\nTo be successful, like anything, you must put in the reps and hours of practice before you need it. \n\nEnjoy the process of learning, I hope you\u2019ll be prepared and ready for a situation that never happens and you never need any of it! \n\nLast point because it\u2019s going long: preparation, practice, and development of these skill will reduce your chance of needing these skills. You\u2019ll simply be over prepared so minor situations are no big deal, or you\u2019ll avoid suspect situations entirely. \n\nNever force a bad position, it\u2019s ok to punt and regroup.",

But it's still better than anything with general knowledge.\n\nGeneral knowledge can lead to a false sense of security. You'll confidently do the wrong things. Like on the latest series of Alone (Tasmania)... where a bunch of people are tapping out because they just can't find food. Food *is* available but they're using all the wrong techniques for the local area... and those are experienced survival people. Someone with less experience has almost no chance unless they either know the local area or can get rescued very quickly.",

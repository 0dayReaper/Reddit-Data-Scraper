If you can\u2019t get out, wet your arms by dipping them in the water, take them back out and put them on the surface of the ice so your clothing sticks. Death will come quickest by drowning. Hypothermia can take hours and hours and you still ha e a decent shot at being rewarmed. \n\nSo freeze your arms to the surface. That way even if you pass out from the cold or hypothermia, you won\u2019t slip into the water and drown.",

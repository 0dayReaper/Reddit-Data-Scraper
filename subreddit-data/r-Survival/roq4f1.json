The doctors gave up on him but he is slowly pulling through. He is still surviving. He caught a beautiful redtail cat fish here. He was so proud.",

            "comment": "After having cancelled 2 prior trips due to cancer I finally got to take my father around Guyana and Brazil and show him my work/life. \n\nWe fished many different species of fish including Arowana, redtailed catfish and peacock bass, saw lots of wildlife including giant anteaters, tapir, giant river otters and king vultures. We had some crazy run ins with caiman, drove over a broken bridge, went hunting, got him a private tour through one of the indigenous communities we work with, flew with a crazy pilot through a river just a few meters above the water, ate piranha sushi with out fresh caught piranhas, rode horses and gathered cattle. \n\nIt was just amazing trip. Being old school he didn't say it of course but later on I heard from my sister how proud he was. \n\nHe lost close to 50 pounds in the last month but he has stabilized now. When/if he recovers im going to take him to Greenland to set up and test an artic survival trip. Never give up! Keep surviving! \n\nMerry christmas and happy new year everyone!",

I hope your father continues breaking the doctors expectations and you are both able to have time together. Congratulations on being able to showcase what you do and who you help to him directly. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s extremely proud.",

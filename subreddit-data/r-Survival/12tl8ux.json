    "postText": "I like reading about people that survived after natural disasters, or urban warfare and things like that. But most of the stuff I find online is about the disaster itself,  not really too much of the aftermath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYoutube videos are cool too. I watched the Katrina disaster video and was enthralled about how some of these people managed to survive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny recommendations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the recommendations. Looks like I have some reading to do.",

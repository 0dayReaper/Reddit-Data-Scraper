    "postText": "I have noticed in this sub and a lot of popular survival YouTubers/tiktokers there isn\u2019t much emphasis on plant identification. I think knowing common species in your region is important for anyone but especially survivalists. \n\nBeing able to ID plants can help you find edible ones, but also help you avoid harmful ones (poison ivy, oak, sumac). It can teach you how best to eat them, what season they are available, and what parts are edible. It can help you better hunt animals by identifying patches of plants they prefer to eat. It can help in construction of shelters, as some trees are easier to harvest and work with than others.\n\nWith lots of knowledge, you can begin to notice where waterbodies, even ground water, is abundant by plant species. You can tell what aspect of a slope you are on in mountainous regions with no compass and no sun/stars. You can even identify plants for crude medicine, like willow bark. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to state how useful it is to educate yourself on local plant species. It is now believed that Christopher McCandless died from overconsumption of certain \u201cedible\u201d plants which contained toxins that were lethal in large doses. Many plants have varying degrees of toxicity so varying your diet as much as possible is crucial.",

            "comment": "Very true.  Everyone should start with a few easy  to identify and abundant in their area.  As well as plants that are abundant nearly everywhere such as cattails, garlic mustard, and wild carrots... And their learning look alikes  \n\nGetting an app such as leaf snap helps you learn.  I will often see an abundant plant and wonder if it is a useful plant or if it is what I think it is.  Before long, knowledge grows.  I'm confident I could find something to eat anywhere in the US.  Not saying I could keep my belly full in the dead of winter but maybe enough to keep my energy up while I'm finding a better source or finding rescue.",

Too many chemicals from cars and sprayers.  I also would do the edibility test on anything I wasn't super familiar with in case they have a lookalike.  \n\nI also passed lots of maple trees (Seeds are out of season but young leaves are edible.)

When you talk to anyone, whether it's a survivalist, someone who just wants to live off the land, basically anyone who intends to spend a lot of time in wilderness and using what they find for subsistence, plant identification is very far down the list for most of them as far as important things they need to know. Or that they'll just be able to go out and figure it out.\n\nAnd if you have knowledge on plant identification, you know how **hard** it can be to accurately identify them consistently.",

When in doubt, use 3 different sources to help you identify what you are looking at. The universal edibility test and apps do not count as a source.  Never use the universal edibility test unless it's literally a last resort in a life or death situation.  As Les Stroud says, it is best to learn from somebody that already knows what they are doing.  Plenty of foraging classes out there that you can take with experts.\n\nStep 3: Learn other common edible plants around the world and take note of their lookalikes.

If you stick to one area that\u2019s one thing, and even if you are traveling I would encourage study of the plants common to your destination, but you most likely won\u2019t be completely confident if all you\u2019ve done is studied pictures in a book.

Use the knowledge from your study, but before you start gulping mouthfuls of something you think is safe from your study, use the test to confirm.  \nThere are plants that are edible and fall into a category where all other plants they are commonly confused with are also edible.

I learned to make a very expensive sugar from the immature pine cones. The orange decorative berries are actually sea plants and aledible. So it takes time but start with identifying what if around you everyday before overwhelming and discouraging yourself with a giant \"look for these to eat\" type identification books. That's for the next level, not beginners. And because of thst fact I think that's why plant identification is way down the list\n\nNot for me though",

It bunches into your belt gear pretty easily. \n\nIf your pants get soiled you can easily switch to skirt while you wash and dry your pants.\n\nAlso, it looks like per OP, I can also repurpose pants as backpack. Great info.\n\nSkirts are great survival gear.\n\nEdit: why did my comment get downvoted? My survival tip is excellent. You can wear a skirt as part of your survival carry. It provides a simple way of having back up clothing and insulation, extra towel, etc. If you are in a survival situation, that is not the time to be embarassed about wearing women's clothing. Samurai and highlanders wore skirts as battle gear (hiding feet is excellent tactic in melee fight). And per the OP post, I can wear the skirt and repurpose my pants as a backpack. In short, downvoter, grow up!",

The only problem that I can see with the idea of carrying a jar of peanut butter in your backpack is that by necessity you\u2019ll need to travel as light as possible when you\u2019re out trekking in the wilderness, and that\u2019s why in most cases it simply isn\u2019t practical to weigh yourself down with all kinds of excess gear like a jar of peanut butter when you\u2019re out trekking in the wilderness. You can set up a trap like the Ojibwa bird snare without bait, for example, but we all know that a baited trap is always going to be more effective than a non-bated trap, so how are you going to locate some bait for your trap line ?",

            "comment": "You really need to know the local insects to answer that question.\n\nFor example around here there are a lot of large (like, as big as your finger) insects that eat dead wood. So find some rotting wood and tear it apart, you'll find plenty of bait.\n\nYou can also just eat the insects, if your trap line doesn't work out. They're high in protein and high in fat. In fact, probably less work (for the same dietary intake) to eat them. I'd bet 30 minutes of digging around rotten wood with a knife would give you enough for a substantial sized meal. It wouldn't be as tasty as, say, a good sized and well cooked fish, but good luck catching a fish in 30 minutes.",

But the odds of needing this to survive out of the blue are almost zero. \n\nI did a lot of research on the kid from the bus in Alaska because the movie Into the wild is one of my favorite movies. It just happens to be a real story. \n\nChris McCandless intentionally went into the Alaska wilderness without proper preparation or skills. \nFor example - he was never more than 10 miles from people.\nHe didn\u2019t learn how process large game into jerky. Had he learned that - he would have survived. He shot a moose but it spoiled on him. \nWhen he decided to leave the stream he had to cross was a rushing whitewater river from spring melt. \nBut he didn\u2019t want to use a map. A couple miles downstream there was a ferry for crossing. \n\nAnd he tried to forage. But he wasn\u2019t familiar with local plants. Plant identification is not a general skill. You learn 1 local plant at a time. And if you are not sure if plant is edible or not - there\u2019s a process developed by US military in World War 2 to minimize the risk of poisoning yourself. \n\nHe didn\u2019t follow that process. If he had - he likely wouldn\u2019t have poisoned himself with the plant he ate.",

No disrespect when I say this, but it doesn't sound like you've actually spent time real world trapping animals. \n\nEven shows like Alone, Survivorman, etc no one spends time baiting traps. It's just not worth the time and energy.\n\nIf we're just fantasy survival talking like most folks on here do, then by all means.. PB is probably my favorite bait. Tons of small game love it, it sticks well to triggers causing stuff to work it more(cheese, fruit and other stuff like that gets dry/cold and comes off triggers too easy). Plus it really doesn't take much to make something appealing to nibble on because it's super smelly comparatively and way tastier than anything in nature to small game. With a small jar of PB you could bait 100s of traps, we're talking like grams per trigger. When I was younger and less discriminate(kids are dumb) PB on the pan of a #1-2 long spring killed a lot of squirrels and wood rats.",

Offal from trapped game works well enough too though obv you have to catch something first.\n\nLot of herbivores like tree bark in winter. Things like procupines and rabbits will happily go for non-toxic, palatable deciduous branches. You can make a trap for snowshoe hares by cutting several long spruce limbs, leave the foliage and use them to create a big box. Cut gaps in the branches and weave the foliage to create believable walls. Stick snares in the gaps youve created and bait the center of the box with fresh birch or maple branches.\n\nBirds are tricky because while they will go for berries or insects, they wont bother with your trap if theres an abundance of fresher food nearby. Most birds are also too small to make good catches. Ground birds like turkey or grouse are your best bet. \n\nOne thing ive wanted to try actually doesnt require bait. I want to make a perch trap using the same principle as squirrel poles. Make a tall T or L shaped perch in an open space like a bog, field or clearing. Then line the horizontal limb with snares that sit maybe a centimeter above the limb and maybe a couple inches wide on the snare. The idea is to catch the birds foot when they take off, close the snare and suspend them from the perch.\n\nYou should look into motion activated snares that you just put on game trails or near food/water too. Relying too much in bait can hinder your abilities.",

That being said, if you somehow find yourself in a situation that you deem it necessary for your survival, legalities don\u2019t matter and you\u2019re probably out of peanut butter if you did bring it.\n\nStep one: evaluate the food you may be trying to trap and think of all the different things they may be eating.  \nStep two: gather samples of what they may be eating and lay them out in an area you have marked in such a way that you will know what is missing. \nStep three: check your samples to see if any have been eaten in abundance. That is your bait.\n\nEdit: typo",

You can get little disposable single serving canisters, bit I personally loved the MRE squeeze packet when I was on patrol.  Bite the top, and just squeeze, one handed.",

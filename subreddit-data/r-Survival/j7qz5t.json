Granted, the stream we were fishing was very recently stocked with hungry trout. But it does actually work. It helps if the thorns from what we called \u201cgreenbriar\u201d or \u201cpricker bushes\u201d at the time, are fairly fresh and green.",

If you're going to keep it cut the bottom where gil plates meet to drain blood and oily taste or smack it with a log or big stone to end it not just because its humane but it also doesn't wiggle away.

Some of these little meat balls are just too little! I still keep about 30 feet of line and a few hooks in a pill bottle with a cork float just incase.

Even when they're fairly unreliable, on a trot-line you can have dozens of hooks working for you and you only need one or two to work to get a full meal out of it. \n\nBut yea, I expect if someone's idea of fishing is at the end of a single rod, when you actively set the hook before reeling in your catch, they won't have much success.\n\nWith multiple set lines, I'd check them carefully and with a landing net if possible.

Y'all are so ignorant to think this wouldn't work when most of yall haven't been outside in weeks or live in a climate completely void of woody thorned plants. Go out and try it some time, jesus. Ive used this technique and seen it represented in scout and wilderness manuals time and time again. There are plenty of woody, thorny plants with robust enough thorns to pull in a fish. A 20lb salmon? Maybe not but this is survival and a 1lb sunfish would be clutch and totally obtainable with a hook as pictured.\n\nOP, this is sick. /r/survival, I quit",

As a few commenters have mentioned, this method seems like it is best used on a trotline which has numerous hooks and increases chances of success. Another benefit is that thorns are readily available and do not require much modification. Gorge hooks are probably more robust, but a tool might be needed to sharpen the points. These thorn hooks can be made without any tools. Although landing a large fish is not likely, you might get a small one that could make a huge difference in a survival situation.",

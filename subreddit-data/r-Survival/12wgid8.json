    "postText": "I am all for foraging, fishing, hunting... but realistically, in a wilderness survival situation, one probably should focus on the basics, before worrying about where the next meal is coming from.\n\nIn scouts, we talk about how--\n\n* You can survive for 3 Minutes without air (oxygen) or in icy water.\n\n* You can survive for 3 Hours without shelter in a harsh environment (unless in icy water)\n\n* You can survive for 3 Days without water (if sheltered from a harsh environment) \n\n* You can survive for 3 Weeks without food (if you have water and shelter)\n\nThus, If you ever find yourself in a wilderness survival situation you must think carefully and prioritize your actions. Typically, survival priorities should be considered in some order. Of course, the nature of each survival situation ultimately dictates the appropriate order. \n\nI always start with these, when helping youth understand what they face, in crisis situations out-of-doors: (1) Keep a Positive Attitude; (2) stop immediate health threats with First Aid; (3) protect yourself from the elements with Shelter; (4) get hydrated by finding and validating a source of Water; (5) keep Warm (see 3); (6) establish a system to let searchers know where you are via Signals; and (7) then assuage hunger by sourcing and consuming Food.\n\nDid I miss anything? Seasons can impact the order of these, but what are appropriate considerations for non-temperate-mid-latitude biomes?",

I once fasted for 30 days drinking only water and an occasional sugar free iced tea and I was still able to function fine.\n\nThe hardest part I think about not eating would actually be getting enough water because your water need skyrockets when your body starts turning fat to energy. We also normally get a lot of our water from the food we eat so we also need to consume more water if only to compensate for that reduced water-in-food intake. If you have water, you\u2019ll be fine, albeit maybe a little less \u201cfun.\u201d",

You might consider adding a fasting experiment with your scouts, I think it would be valuable to show how people can get so much easier frustrated, angry, etc. when your blood sugar is low, and how it can directly cause a first aid emergency in some people, such as diabetics. It doesn't need to be starvation, but teens going 8 hours without food will usually show their hangry side lol I think it could be a very valuable teaching aid",

The rebuild effort takes a long time and there just won't be enough homes. The ones that weren't damaged or have been repaired always go to whoever has the most money.\n\nYes, I will, and have, evacuate. But I'm also doing everything in my power to avoid being one of the people ho has to go through that, and I'll also do everything in my power to go back home as soon as possible. If that means weeks or even months without basic \"essentials\" like electricity, then i'll take that over evacuation ever time.\n\nAs important as they are, food/shelter are simple. Find a way out of the rain/wind. Filter and boil your water. Done. Food on the other hand is often very difficult, and that's why this sub should focus on food primarily in my opinion.",

Polar exporers had to consume MANY  more calories than normal to survive, and whether or not you can FUNCTION without caloric input is entirely different. If you can only feebly curl up in a fetal positon stupor rather than help yourself be alert and able to possibly be rescued through some actions on your part, is another matter, and if you become too weak to finally get the nourishment you require to survive longer, it could be game over. Don't be blas'e about generalized statements like those.  You may need to be proactive in saving your life/being rescued by getting calories, ESPECIALLY in colder/cold conditions. Your brain needs calories to function well, and your functioning well is rather important.",

Not only your energy levels but your cognitive abilities decline rapidly with no nourishment. Survival is largely about calories in vs calories out, as a person who has worked in the wilderness extensively I always had food on me. Foraging can be done at all times while achieving other goals, if you see rabbits or game trails while buildings a shelter it\u2019s worth the time to set up a few snares, if there are ducks on a pond now they might not be later, so it\u2019s worth it to skip a step and get some meat while you have the chance. You need to be adaptive and not think it terms of step 1 step 2 etc. it\u2019s more like, what do I NEED, what\u2019s easy to get, how do I burn the least amount of calories compared to how many calories I\u2019m eating",

That alone can put you out of commission if you\u2019re sweating excessively.  A lot of what we know about going without food comes from people who have fasted in controlled settings.  Take Gandhi for example. He went 21 days with no food.  However, he did drink water with salt and lemon juice in order to mitigate any really harmful side effects such as an electrolyte deficiency. During that time he was not moving around much, slept a lot, and was also monitored by medical professionals.",

I\u2019m not going to address any of the stuff you said about people being stupid or lacking skill because people who go out into remote areas alone and unprepared are going to get themselves wrecked and they certainly aren\u2019t reading any of this.\n\nI\u2019ll make this very simple:\n\nIf you are going into a remote area you are coming back out in one of two ways: under your own power the way you went in, or being rescued. If you are capable of walking out then you can just do that any time, so it\u2019s not really a survival situation. You have redundant equipment commensurate with the difficulty of extracting yourself and if you lose something critical you use your backup to get out safely before things get out of hand.\n\nA survival situation is almost by definition one in which you cannot extract yourself for whatever reason. In that case you also have redundant methods for securing rescue. You should have a sat messenger that you can use to call for help and broadcast your exact location. If you get in trouble AND your sat messenger breaks you are already two rare occurrences in, but luckily you have a route filed and you aren\u2019t lost because you also have a gps and compass and multiple paper maps of the area and the skills required to use them. You also know what the local emergency services advise for the area you\u2019re operating in because you checked in with them before you went off into the wilderness alone. \n\nSo in the case where your sat messenger is down and you\u2019re in trouble then you park it and make a big fire and lay signals, and when you don\u2019t check in at the previously arranged time then that will trigger the rescue effort. \n\nThe worst realistic scenario will be that you have to sit around for a few days or even a week or two. A small amount of emergency food in your pack will keep you just fine until they show up. If they don\u2019t show up within a week of you missing your check in you should be saying your prayers because they aren\u2019t coming and you can\u2019t extract yourself.\n\nThis is all pretty basic wilderness safety, if you can avoid acute trauma there\u2019s no reason to ever get yourself in serious trouble because you have layered contingency plans that prevent you from ever getting anywhere near a situation where you\u2019re lost and starving to death and nobody knows where you are. You don\u2019t go out there and roll the dice and hope things go your way, and if you\u2019re anywhere near the point where you\u2019re facing starvation you are as good as dead because you\u2019ve already screwed up a dozen different ways.",

OP's post addresses the real-world possibility of true emergency wilderness survival, not zombies, not super quakes, not going out and deliberately playing in the woods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA wilderness survival situation is not planned for, or simulated properly, or practiced for real in any specific way, in fact, if it IS real all bets are off.\n\n\\-break into cabins \n\n\\- burn down a utility pole\n\n\\- hunt and fish with no limits (grin)\n\n\\- you do what you have to do \n\nSo again if you're out there on a canoe trip, or backpacking, or hunting or whatever outdoor wilderness thing you're doing causes that event to morph into a true survival situation then go crazy but food won't be one of them.  Food, is and will be WAY down the list - you may not like it,  or like the prep crowd, you can't deal with reality.   But is it what it is, and OP's post is correct again for a real emergency outdoor wilderness survival situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFood does not matter in that scenario, agan for the specific and very real reason that it's not going to last.  It's just fact.  As in, if you DO regularly do this stuff then you're going to be filing flight plans with family and friends - a la after you're overdue the grown up will be coming for your ass so you got to last.  Again up here 72 hours on average.  When CASARA  get's a call out from JRCC we're have crews up in under an hour a lot of the time and we have a very strong idea of where you are already.  That's what we do go find the crash site and call in the grown-ups.\n\nSo yea you're in a emergency survival situation for a few hours or a day , not weeks or months.  That's just reality, so stop embellishing what you did or what your plans are to kill a moose with your K-bar knife because you won't need to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHell for that matter back in the day when I was up north canoe tripping you had nothing - no radios, no GPS, no sat devices, no comm's of any kind.  If an aircraft flew by you could try a ground to air signal fire and that was it.  These days that's slightly changed, I went blue water sailing in 2014 from Hawaii to the Line Island and I was texting friends from the middle of the Pacific ocean and they could track us.  So the risks of getting \"Lost\" in the woods can pretty much be eliminated and that just the way things work now.  It's progress and there's nothing wrong with that.",

I'm thinking that some could get quickly into trouble or maybe even expire.   But disclaimer I am NOT a medical doctor or anything.  Talk about diabetes, etc is beyond my competence.  However, I have been on hiking trips, etc many times where a friend or someone is having a medical issue.  Then the person or someone else is going around asking people-  Do you have a candy bar or something? \n\nAlso, I'll add another point.  Dehydration and lack of food increases the danger from hypothermia.  In NH where I live, there are many cases where people didn't make it through the first night.  Typically there were many factors that led up to that result.  But who knows?  Having water to drink and a few high-energy snacks could have been enough to save the person.\n\nBut your point here is well put.  Many people fixate on food when in the short term there are many other important (and often neglected) things to talk about.  Most people lost in the wilderness don't survive long enough to worry about hunting and fishing.  And if you are too badly injured or too sick to hike out, then you also can't hunt, fish, or forage much if at all.",

            "comment": "I made a very similar post a while ago, and caught quite a lot of shit for it too lol. \n\nThe fact is, the clock is ticking in emergency wilderness survival. The priorities are first aid (if necessary), shelter, ideally fire, and of course water. That's it. Because the rest of your time needs to be spent effecting your rescue. Whether it is navigating to safety, or to a better spot to be noticed. Or staying put and utilizing a variety of signalling techniques to attract the attention of someone who can rescue you. \n\nThe idea of realizing you're lost or stranded, then setting up snares and fishing and foraging is absolutely absurd. They're great skills to have, and you're definitely better off being fed when it's convenient to do so. So nobody should read this and go \"I don't need to learn edible plants and mushrooms, I don't need to know how to fish or trap.\" That's not what I'm saying. But in real life, rescue is a matter of days if not hours. It sucks to say, but generally (especially if there is less than ideal weather conditions) the window of hope is like 72 hours. Maybe a week at most. If they haven't found evidence of your presence and continued survival within 72 or at best 120 hours, they basically begin to treat it like a recovery mission and not a rescue. As in, they're looking for a corpse. The urgency is gone. Your hope of rescue drops significantly. \n\n[Imagine this, you're in your little lean-to shelter, munching on blanched stinging nettles and roasted cattail. Maybe you got a rabbit or squirrel if the stars are aligned. Meanwhile, 5 miles away there is a S&amp;R team on the ground looking for you. There's a helicopter in the air too. You're just vibing in your little shelter. They don't notice you, and that's **it**. It's been 3 days, pouring rain, and they're starting to wonder if you're already dead.]\n\nHopefully you get the idea. If your urgent needs (first aid, shelter, fire, water) are met then you need to signal extensively *or* be on the move to effect your rescue. It needs to be your full time job. Create large X in a clearing out of stones or fallen trees. Have a cold and smokey fire going literally all day. Use your mirror to signal at any distant aircraft or sea vessels. These are all what get you saved. \n\nAnyway I'll stop rambling. Hunting, trapping, fishing and foraging are not anywhere on your list of priorities in the first 3-5 days. Just getting enough firewood, and keeping a fire going, is a full time job on its own.",

            "comment": "While I agree that it is lower than air, water, shelter, its also depends on the situation. I've been doing long back country hiking trips for about 15 years, and one of my toughest situations was when I was hiking rim to rim to rim at the Grand Canyon in April about 10 years ago. I was a pretty inexperienced hiker and and survivalist back then but I was in good physical conditioning. \n\nThe first 2 days went smoothly and I had planned a conservative 5 day trip and decided to push it to 4 because I had run out of food. I could have \"survived\" for a couple more weeks without food, but if I had stayed in the canyon for another 2 or 3 more days without the calories I don't think I would have made it out on my own. as it was I didn't eat anything after my climb down from the north rim to Cottonwood camp on day 3. Day 4 I woke up and ate my last two packs of instant oatmeal and headed out to try to make it from Cottonwood Canyon up and out of Bright Angel, and while I don't remember the distance, it was really pushing my personal limit and the elevation ascending the south rim can be a killer. \n\nIn my last 2 or 3 miles coming out of the canyon I colapsed multiple times from exhaustion and would just roll over on my bag and pull out a peanut butter tube from my hip pouch which was the last of the last of the food I had. Those tubes of peanut butter made a huge difference and if I had just packed a little better I wouldn't have put my body through so much strain and potential injury.\n\nAgain I agree with your premise that food isn't the most important thing to consider in a \"survival\" scenario, its very easy to think of a bug out situation or a outdoor adventure gone awry in which food can mean difference between life and death. Things like just building a shelter, gathering water, and starting a fire, can be strenuous and at the end of a long hike or physical exertion downright impossible without enough energy. \n\nTLDR:\nSo yes food isn't the most important, but don't discount it because not accounting for it can leave you without enough energy to do the more important survival stuff.",

Help is almost always around the corner or not far away. \n\nSome of these wanna be Daniel Boone types on this sub put themselves into extremely dangerous \u2018survival\u2019 situations to see if they can subsist for weeks by themselves in a misguided attempt at living off the grid with no one else\u2019s help because they believe in extreme individualism. They don\u2019t believe anyone else is going to help them. They think that survival means doing it alone. \n\nYou know differently. Scouts work together in groups. We have leaders. You\u2019re trained to be one. It\u2019s rare to be surviving alone. \n\nSo ignore these untrained, yet well-meaning redditors and focus on learning what is in the [Wilderness Survival Merit Badge](https://www.troop109nj.com/app/download/5843887/Wilderness+Survival+Merit+Badge+Pamphlet+35966.pdf):\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Worry about Food\n\n\u201cBeing hungry is not very pleasant, but on the list of survival priorities, it is not very high, either. Keeping warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather, finding shelter, drinking plenty of water, and signaling your location are all more important than finding something to eat.\n\n\u201cOnce you have taken care of the necessities of survival, you can give some thought to sources of food. You may have the ingredients for camp meals in your pack.\n\n\u201cExperts in wilderness survival can tell which plants are safe to eat and which might cause intestinal stress or even poisoning. Unless you are absolutely sure of the identity of a plant and know it is safe to eat, it\u2019s best to leave vegetation alone. The same is true of most wildlife. A length of nylon line and a hook can be useful in using insects or worms to catch a fish or two, but in most cases the energy you burn in trying to capture an animal and prepare it to be safely eaten would be better used improving your shelter, gathering water, and taking care of other survival priorities.\u201d",

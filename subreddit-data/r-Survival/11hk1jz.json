    "postText": "I love the E&amp;E, but it's just a little too small for a patrol style bag. Anyone know of anything almost identical but just a little bigger ? I have the direct action gear, ghost bag.. it's awesome, just not the right size for the system I want. I also have the crossfire DG1, which would probably be perfect if it didn't have the helmet pouch. So what's in-between these two, and the Kifaru E&amp;E ?",

The only thing different besides some additional inside pouches is that it doesn't have the ability to dock to my main ruck sack like the E&amp;E. I've got another attachment system, so that's not a deal breaker.\n\n[almost identical to the E&amp;E](https://www.varusteleka.com/en/product/sarma-tst-cp15-combat-pack-main-bag/62218?country=US&amp;variant=33916&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA0oagBhDHARIsAI-BbgcgH1lLNQ8I7jGv30NH7XIJRAGQG0Jd5OMImm5ctjFq8lBS6ZEiL1oaAtkAEALw_wcB)\n\nThe dimensions are just a couple inches bigger, which just might be exactly what I'm looking for. Might still be too small, but it's a risk I'm willing to take.",

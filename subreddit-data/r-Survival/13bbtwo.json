Though it says three hours for shelter, most people only continue to look for or prepare a shelter at the two-hour point. The same is true for water, where without a strong survival instinct, they stop looking for water after two days. The will to live stops most people from continuing to search for food beyond two weeks. The US Army Ranger School limits food, water, and sleep to force one to prove they have the will to continue. In 1980, I made the mistake of starting Ranger School with a dislocated shoulder. I tore it up more before getting a medical out of the course. I am remembering it fondly tonight, as it is aching. I had surgery three weeks ago, and it has improved except for the occasional twinge.",

It\u2019s little successes like that that help keep your mind positive. Also having backup plans. As soon as plan A fails you immediately move to step B.

I\u2019m thinking of buying a firearm in case I want to shoot birds. The garden may or may not have nettles.",

Make sure your mess kit has backup life straws and redundant firestarters.  Pack lots of ammo, at least 1000 rounds for each weapon.  You'll need at least 6 pairs of socks, don't wanna neglect your feet.  Also, you'll need a rain poncho and a tarp plus at least 1000 feet of paracord.  If it's especially iffy, pack a takedown crossbow and at least 100 bolts for it.  Don't forget your katana you got at the mall, and your zombie club.  And for all occasions, body armor with ballistic ceramic plates.  Full body, of course.  And finally, your choice of Bic or zippo lighter.  You gotta have something to light torches if you your battery light fails.  Good luck out there....",

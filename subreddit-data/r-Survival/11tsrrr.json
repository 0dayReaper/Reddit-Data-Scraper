I would like an extensive course, maybe up to two months in duration, but I\u2019m not sure where to look as there is a lot of stuff on the internet. I also don\u2019t want the \u201cDude ranch\u201d experience as far as I am interested in learning ways to build a fire, use a compass, find my way out of the wilderness, make shelters, fins water, etc. etc. How do I look into this? Thanks guys and gals.",

This forum keeps getting stuck with the same problem over and over...... and the Mods cleared it up about a month ago. \n\nThis Sub called: r / Survival   is not about surviving the zombie attack, it's not  about surviving to fight the red commie menace after they invade.  Or living after the big one, the big one being asteroid, or super quake or whatever your thing is.  (grin)  It's also not about you wanting to write the next Walden book either or running away to the woods to become our next Jeremiah Johnson - you can't anyway folks - the Feds own all the land in Canada and they're not gonna let you go play on it.  Hell, they won't even sell it unless you wanna open a business to exploit our land.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sub is about wilderness survival, so if you're out hunting and you get lost, or in a plane crash then you're in the right place.  \n\nThere is a course going on put on by COPA in Innisfail on April 23 &amp; 24 for pilots who crash, I'm in CASARA and I took it a year ago .... it was OK.\n\nIf you want a longer course - then go look at Karamat Wilderness Ways in Alberta but yer not going to find any thing like a 2 month course, they have one in July from the 16th to the 22 but again.  It's a bushcraft wilderness living skills course NOT a survival course.\n\nIn this sub anyway it's about \"wilderness survival\" short term, again plane crash, lost backpacker, or hunter, etc.  It means you learn to know what to do while the grown-ups (SAR Teams) are out looking for your lost ass because you filed a flight plan with someone before the trip.\n\nIf you really want to learn that stuff - start camping and backpacking and learning the hobby Geocaching ........\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have LOTS of info about \"survival courses\" depending on your definition of survival.  It's not a secret - type in the words \"survival courses canada\" and work on your \"google-fu\" skills first.",

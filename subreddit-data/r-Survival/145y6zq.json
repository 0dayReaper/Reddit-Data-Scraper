For what reason would it be fake?\n\nI'm genuinely happy to be proven otherwise. but I don't smell anything fishy personally.\n\nIn this second video im watching the grandfather is speaking about how he's happy and what not. \n\nJust seems like a lot to fake for not a lot of reason\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx-Fax04uog\n\nIt shows the kids coming out a plane after rescue. Unless literally all the rescuers in the video, are all in on it? The (different) kids are in on it? Just can't see how it's fake or what is fake.",

Were there two small plane crashes with children about the same age? It seems highly unlikely. \n\nI don\u2019t recall what media I read about it in then, but I am looking at a website for mercopress.com dated May 18th that has an early version of that particular story. \n\nI am glad the children are okay but something does seem odd.",

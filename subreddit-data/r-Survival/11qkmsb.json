    "postText": "I've had a credit-card-sized signal mirror in my emergency wilderness survival kit for many years. I've kept it sandwiched between random credit card-sized cards (such as expired library cards) to protect it. Then I got to thinking about what useful survival items I could sandwich the mirror between. Then this got me thinking more generally about, \"What would be the best credit card-sized and shaped survival items to carry?\"   \n\n\nHere are a few I came up with:  \n\n\n1) The aforementioned signal mirror, of course. This can also be useful for examining parts of your body that you can't see, for first aid.  \n\n\n2) a fresnel lens. As long as there's strong sunlight, you can start a fire without using up other things like matches or lighter fuel. It's also good for examining yourself closely for first aid.  \n\n\n3) Grim Workshop Hot Shot Fire Starting Survival Card. The same shape as a credit card (but a bit thicker) with a flat ferrocerium rod, a striker for the rod, a flat magnesium bar, and a little knife.   \n\n\n4) A credit card-sized sheet of heat-moldable plastic. I figure this could be good for repairing glasses, repairing a tent pole, repairing a knife handle, making a small splint for first aid on broken fingers or toes, and so on.  \n\n\n5) A credit card-sized reference for making knots that are good for the outdoors. I could imagine myself forgetting how to tie certain knots under duress.  \n\n\n6) An emergency medical information card. I'd include information such as my name, age, blood type, medical conditions, emergency contact information, etc.  \n\n\nI know there are also tons of credit card-shaped multi-tools, but they don't typically seem that useful. Also, I know that there are metal cards with stuff like fishing hooks and arrow heads to use, but I doubt I'd be likely to use them in a wilderness survival situation.   \n\n\nWhat other options am I missing? What are the best credit card-shaped survival items to stick in a kit or wallet?  \n\n\nThanks.",

If that $20 wont get you out of a bind, the $100 sure will...unless you're being robbed.\n\nI got stuck in a freak snow storm and could not make it up a hill close to home one time. I asked a dude in a 4x4 for a tow up the hill for $40. I only had a $20 in my wallet but then i remembered my emergency stash.  Saved me from walking home and leaving my car where it could get hit.\n\nEdit: spellling.\n\nAlso to add, i keep a razor blade in my wallet always.

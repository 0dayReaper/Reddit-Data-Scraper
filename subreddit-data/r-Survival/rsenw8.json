Further there are situations when we need to venture in to an area where we can't take our guns and this can be a nice back for different survival situations as it's a repeater crossbow carrying 5 arrows thar can be shot in quick succession.",

Just preparing that day to go of on an expedition to retrieve equipment that crashed near the mouth of the river Amazon. About 200 km south of Macapa. As my luck always seem to be it fell in another flooded forest. Good times! Got a nasty spider bite on that trip when we were taking some of the equipment pieces apart.",

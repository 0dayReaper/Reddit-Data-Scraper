I'm not being an ass - just saying, there are places that can both help you and sell you what you need, all without supporting the Amazonopoly. \n\nIncidentally, if you know nothing about whetstones, ANY stone will do while you learn.\n\nSidenote: I always thought campers/outdoorsy ppl would be among the first to avoid amazon, but it seems to be this subreddit's #1 question: \"what is a good XYZ on amazon?\"\n\nSide sidenote: I guess a lot of these types of questions are bots? I dunno.\n\n\nTL;DR : screw besos",

It's SO much better than a stone, heads and shoulders above a stone. Wish just a single cut file I can take a thick dull useless axe and turn it into a screaming cutting machine able to shave arm hair. It's all just technique, understanding, and a bit of work.\n\nFor knives a regular dc4 with a coarser diamond side and fine ceramic will do, add a small loaded strop for good measure",

I sharpen everything on it.   \n\n\nfor my field kit, I use the fallkniven DC4 and a small Arkansas stone. I use my belt to strop.   \n\n\nBut in the past, I have sharpened with sandpaper, cheap hardware store sharpening stones and polished on the bottom of ceramic bowls.",

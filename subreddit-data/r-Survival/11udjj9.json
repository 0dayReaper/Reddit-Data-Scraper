Hard steel will maintain an edge but is also brittle and will chip, while tough steel will dull quicker but won't chip easily.  I've got a variety of knives but the ones I prefer for outdoor use are A2.  \n\nAnd indeed, once you find a good knife and learn how to sharpen, you can refresh an edge by stroping on your bluejeans or the back of your belt.  I find that as long as I strope an edge frequently, I don't really need to sharpen as much.  And to really sharpen, you can find flat river rocks in a variety of grit.

Get an actual whetstone or four, depending on how sharp and shiny you want your blades, and learn how to properly use it.  Will serve you *infinitely* better.\n\nFor regular use pocket knifes and hunting blades, a 500 grit is honestly probably enough. If you sharpen them regularly I'd go with something more in the 750-1000 range.  But considering how dulled they can get in regular use, I'd definitely at least have a 500 grit on hand to bring back to an edge.  Can take a very long time to do with higher grit stones, if the edge is to far gone.\n\nFor my chefs knives, I tried to always maintain an edge that never needed less than a thousand grit to bring back. Then would move on to 3000 and 5000, so that they were incredibly honed and mirror finish edges.  That's not at all necessary with pocket knives or hunting blades.  And I'd probably not take them to a stone past 1000.\n\nThey make some really nice synthetic whetstone these days that can be had for pretty cheap. \n\nThis has everything you need to sharpen any knife, razor blades included.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Whetstone-Sharpening-Professional-Sharpener-Flattening/dp/B0BFHK5DY5/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?crid=1K37SIW7ZNCXY&amp;keywords=sharpening+stone&amp;qid=1679148501&amp;sprefix=sharpening+ston%2Caps%2C183&amp;sr=8-3",

The \"fine\" ceramic side works well to easily keep a decent, but by no means razor, edge on my EDC pocket folders, but they don't need a razor edge anyway. And the stick works fine on the partially serrated ones. The course side, which I've only tried a few times on an already kinda messed up knife, has proved less satisfying and I don't usually need or use it.",

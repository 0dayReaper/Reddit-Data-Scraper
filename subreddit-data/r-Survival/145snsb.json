Jaguars, bullet ants, poison dart frogs, lancehead snakes, banana spiders are only some of the dangerous critters to watch out for.\n\nBut, on the flipside, it doesn\u2019t get very cold, water is fairly abundant, and food can be abundant IF you know where to find it. You get lucky with one good source of fruit and you\u2019ll at least have something to keep you moving even if you can\u2019t trap/hunt game. \n\nIf you grew up there, especially among the indigenous people, you probably know at least some of the basics. \n\nAs an outsider you better learn as much about the native flora and fauna as possible, because there is a lot of it and it\u2019s going to be key to your survival. \n\nHave a machete and try to get to a navigable water way are probably your best chances.",

Rather difficult, most people would have died\n\nBut a 13 year old ingigenous person knows more how to survive out there than myself, a full grown person in their 30s that has camped longer than that kid has been alive.\n\nThe difference is immersion and practice. They live it every single moment of every single day. So my 3-5 day trips with gear and safety nets is worth nothing to someone that's lived that way their entire life.",

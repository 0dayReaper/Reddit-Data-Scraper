    "postText": "Thank you for being apart of the r/Survival community. We appreciate everyone who has contributed to the overall discussion about Wilderness Survival. Please remember to review the rules of our sub before posting any content or comments.\n\nThis is a community to discuss wilderness survival and bushcraft topics. \n\nThe moderators have noticed an increase in off topic conversations which violate several of the subreddits rules. The largest being rule number 10 regarding posts that are more catered to bugging out, prepping, SHTF/TEOTWAWKI, and combat related content. While we appreciate everyone\u2019s enthusiasm to grow this community and have conversations about these topics, they are not appropriate for r/Survival and belong in other subreddits dedicated to them. \n\nThe moderators will be keeping an eye out for posts involving these topics and will remove them without warning if they are posted. If you post again, then you will incur a temporary ban. A third strike will lead to a permanent ban. If you aren\u2019t sure if your post will violate a rule, then reach out to the moderators and we will be happy to let you know. \n\nWe hope that the community will continue to grow and be a place where like minded individuals can come together and discuss their love for survival in the wilderness.",

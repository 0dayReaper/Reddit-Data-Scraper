    "postText": "Hello all.\n\nI am a design student in my senior year and I am working on my design capstone project. I chose the topic of education about first aid/survival skills for adolescents. Right now, I envision the app as a directory for first aid instructions with images or also animated tutorials that you can look up the protocol and revise quickly.\n\nWhat are some features that you think might be suitable to incorporate into this app/game?\n\nMany thanks. Any help is super appreciated.\n\n**UPDATE:** Hey guys. Thank you all for your input, they mean so much. However, I\u2019m thinking of a possibility at a closer scale and for the specific age of teenagers and adolescents. What if the app focuses more on the setting of urban, daily life? Do you have any suggestions?",

There will absolutely be things you come across in them and say, oh that\u2019s a good idea I should add that as an advanced lesson. \n\nBoy Scouts have a Wilderness Survival, Lifesaving (water rescue), and First Aid merit badges. Maybe skim the reference books for topics you may have not thought about. All three are somewhat relevant to this project and although it\u2019s been 15+ years and my memory is hazy I believe the latter two are required for Eagle. I know first aid was. \n\nBasic first aid stuff is obviously your primary goal but I think there\u2019s enough overlap with the other two subjects to add useful knowledge for semi fringe situations, especially trauma care with no immediate emergency service response. Any first aid field guide would also be a good reference point, just don\u2019t plagiarize anything lol. \n\nSkim through subjects in field or wilderness survival type guides along with basic first aid and add some of the more likely scenarios in the game. Even simpler thing a like recognizing hypothermia or CO poisoning are important even if it\u2019s not directly relevant to hands on treatment. Even things a like water purification and edible plants, or plants to treat symptoms of illness can help. Recognizing dangerous bug bites and dangerous plants. Stuff like that is usually not taught in basic first aid. If you\u2019ve never seen a necrotic spider bite, consider yourself lucky.",

            "comment": "I've not been stranded on an island, but I had an experience where I went camping on an island and nearly got swept out to sea on the way there.  \n\nSome quick context, I was probably 10-12, It was myself, my three younger sisters, and my dad. We put all our camping gear in one of those rubber inflatable rafts you get at walmart for $20, then put our masks and fins on and got in the water. The plan was to pull the raft out to a small uninhabited island about a mile off shore. So as you can imagine, not dads greatest idea. Additionally, we got in the water about 30 mins before sunset.  \n\nWhat we didn't count on was a really heavy current between the island we lived on, and the little island we were swimming out towards. At one point, pops and I realized, we were no longer on the interior side of the island, we were swept out towards the outer coast of the island and quickly being swept out to sea.  \n\nWe made it to shore shortly after sunrise, exhausted. My sisters were young enough that they didn't question why it took us 12hrs to swim 1 mile, or why we couldn't see the island we live on from the beach (we were on the exterior side of the island now).  \n\nIt took us a couple days to trek all the gear back to the correct side of the island. It was meant to be a two-night trip, but we knew we couldn't beat that current back to the main island, so we decided to wait on the beach we told mom we were camping on, for someone to come find us. Presumably mom saw our camp fire and assumed we decided to stay longer. Lots of this story don't make sense to me 3 decades later. We left on a friday, we had school on monday, but mom was just cool with us staying out? Also, how the hell does mom let dad swim a mile out to sea with 4 young kids and a rubber raft? anyway.. \n\nEventually one of dads friends came by with an actual powerboat, and picked us up. I remember actually feeling bummed out when he got there. I didn't want to leave. Weird.  \n\nAnyway, we had enough food, and we had spearfishing gear, and there were plenty of coconuts and mangos and such. There was a small spring up the mountain that we could walk to and get fresh water, so we weren't starving or in any real danger once we made it to shore.  \n\nThe number of times my dad almost got me killed as a kid doing stupid shit like that really amazes me in hindsight. For a long time it hadn't occurred to me that the stories would seem amazing/unlikely to others. Just seemed normal to us at the time.",

Or a plane crash?\n\nOr did they surreptitiously steal a raft and flee a ship at sea?\n\nSince I used to pack survival kits professionally I would suggest you include the full complement of gear--some of which could be lost at sea in a storm.\n\nLife rafts for civilian applications generally come in 3 sizes: 4, 10, and 20 persons \n\nThey are preloaded with the gear you mentioned plus manual repair plugs, an air pump, a bilge pump, flares--smoke and aerial, a marker dye that turns the water chartreuse, whistles, signal mirrors, sunscreen lotion, a multi tool, solar stills for converting sea water to fresh water, desalination kits, oars, a cover for sun and storm protection, and a fishing kit.\n\nThings that could sink are tied to a float\n\nYou could have your survivors start with the full complement of gear and lose some of it through various mishaps so that when they get to the island they have only the things you want them to have.\n\nWhoever has the knife will be the leader and will dictate major decisions to the others, unless they're a natural collaborator--your call",

            "comment": "A friend of my dad's was fishing when he got caught in a storm. Like, a really fucking bad storm... sustained wind speeds well over 100mph. Pro tip: check the weather before you go out to sea.\n\nAnyway it was pretty clear he was going to die if he tried to get back to the mainland. He managed to find a sand bar on a reef and flipped the boat upside down as a makeshift shelter. It was a small boat, so all he could do was lay down under it, and the entire sandbar went underwater so he nearly drowned... but after seven hours the storm calmed down enough that he could dig his way out from under the boat without being washed away by the waves. He rowed back to the mainland, the motor was trashed. Arrived on the verge of death from dehydration and heat stroke.\n\nDoesn't sound like a fun experience. I wouldn't recommend it. I don't think he really had any tools, just a bit of water and some fishing equipment. He was only planning to be out to sea for the afternoon.\n\nHe should have checked the weather. Also he should have had an EPIRB and hit the little red button as the storm was approaching. A helicopter probably would've picked him up within an hour or two.\n\nIf it was a larger island, I'd be looking for water and food immediately. Apparently there's usually edible weed plants (often root crops) on islands all over the world, because back in the day sailors used to plant them where they'd thrive in the wild, knowing that one day their life might depend on someone else having done that. You can't survive for long off fish. And catching fish is often very hard work.",

The shelter I\u2019ve made here on the beach of palm fronds, sticks, and logs is holding up decently but when the big storm comes, that will be the real test. I look out across the ocean and there are no planes, no boats. Where is the coast guard? Why haven\u2019t they looked for us? \n\nDay 200 - I hear noises at night, something lurking in bushes. I\u2019ve managed to create a spear for fishing and a slingshot to hunt birds. I think my success in hunting has attracted the largest predators on this island. \nWhat was that? Nooooo!!!

One of the days they offered to take the four of us (two kids, two parents) out to a remote island on the dive boat and pick us up after lunch. So we had a cooler with like four bottles of water, a few towels, sunscreen. On an island maybe 300x100 yds. No shelter, a few palm trees and scrub. \n\nLovely morning swimming and snorkeling, checking out the barracuda that luckily didn\u2019t decide to attack, then it\u2019s suddenly past 2pm and the sandwiches and water are gone. No sign of the boat. \n\nCover the kids in damp towels to keep them from getting sun stroke. By 4 I\u2019m trying to convince my wife who is the strongest swimmer that it is not a good idea for her to do the mile plus open water swim back to the resort. I make a makeshift shelter with some driftwood and the towels covered with sand and a tire to keep us out of the wind and heat. By six the kids (6 and 8) are clued in that the situation is not so good, and we are all cranky and tired. I\u2019m kicking myself that I don\u2019t have any tools other than a bottle opener (left my fishing gear, lighter etc back at camp). Dug a small hole back from the tide line and got enough fresh water on a towel to give the kids a little water. \n\nStill keeping my wife out of the water is getting more difficult. Shortly before sunset a boat (not the dive boat) comes and rescues us. Turns out they a. Lost a solo diver they had to go back for b. Then had the motor die on the dive boat c. Then had the radio die. My wife\u2019s language was well chosen and explicit. \n\nWhat\u2019s it like ? For us, it was hot, dry, thirsty, cranky. Not exactly dangerous, but without the shelter heat stroke was an option, and if any of us had gotten injured it would have been a really bad scene. \n\nLife lesson, never let reliance on others be an excuse for being prepared yourself.",

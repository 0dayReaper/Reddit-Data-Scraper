It lit up like a torch, and I had this horrible premonition of both of us trapped inside of a burning factory with no idea where the exit was. All my trepidation came flooding back, but before I could protest her actions, Nora leaned forward and dropped the flaming shard into the pit of the well. Overcome by curiosity, I leaned over beside her and together we watched as the fireball fell like a comet to the depths of the hole. But it never winked out, it just fell out of sight. We waited for a splash, or thud, but none ever came.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m sure that it would not play out EXACTLY like this, but it\u2019s descriptive jargon and lends a nice imagery to the tale. He says the dry wood would never catch at all, and I said that an old dry shard of wood could ignite pretty easily.",

But if you want to overthink it.....\n\n\"It lit up like a torch\" surprises me, and it makes me think there might be some oil/solvent/creosote/something in/on the wood. It doesn't necessarily have to surprise Nora, however, and even if it does, she doesn't have to show it. It's entirely reasonable(as your viewpoint character so vividly foresaw) for wood in a factory to be soaked in some kind of flammable bonus sauce.\n\nIf I've got an splinter/fragment of pure dry wood without bonuses, I might light it at the pointy end, then hold it point down for a minute or three to let the flames propagate. I (being a dramatic creature IRL)might let it go just before it burns my hand. This assumes the air is still. If not, I need to protect my splinter from the wind.\n\nIf I've got time to prepare and a knife, I'm using it to partially split my splinter so it's \"fuzzy\" which will help it propagate flames faster\n\nThe best upgrade would be a cloth, followed by some of the aforementioned factory flammables. As long as the cloth is soaked in fuel, it acts like a candle wick, and is not consumed. Make sure it's natural fiber and not synthetic, which will melt. This is not \\*like\\* a torch; it is an actual torch.",

It\u2019s such a trivial aspect of the story that I didn\u2019t feel it necessary to dress it up with with exhausting details about how things ignite. \u201cLike a torch\u201d is hyperbolic, I realize that, but the scene was only meant to give context to their environment. I think that it\u2019s extremely nit-picky to criticize a small detail like that, and besides, the entire concept of the story (which is supernatural) is ambiguous and many implausible things happen. I used \u201clike a torch\u201d and did not want to remove it because I thought that it properly represented Nora\u2019s enflamed curiosity. I think that sometimes we can sacrifice realism with metaphor in certain scenarios, but what my cousin was arguing was that a splinter of wood wouldn\u2019t catch at all if held to the flame of a zippo.\n\nThanks for this answer.",

She had found it on the pallet, and she wondered how long it had been there. She had never seen a splinter so old before. It was almost as if it had been there since the beginning of time.\r  \n\r  \nShe took a deep breath and lit the splinter on fire. The flames danced in her hand, and she could feel the heat on her skin. She watched as the splinter slowly burned away, and she wondered what would happen when it was gone.\r  \n\r  \nWhen the splinter was almost gone, she threw it down the hole. She listened as it fell, and she could hear it hit the ground with a thud. She wondered how deep the hole was, and she wondered if she would ever find out.\r  \n\r  \nShe looked down into the hole, but she couldn't see anything. It was too dark. She wondered what was down there, and she wondered if she would ever find out.\r  \n\r  \nShe decided to go down the hole and see for herself. She climbed down the ladder, and she could feel the darkness closing in around her. She was scared, but she was also curious. She wanted to know what was down there.\r  \n\r  \nWhen she reached the bottom of the hole, she found herself in a dark cave. She could hear the sound of water dripping, and she could feel the cold air on her skin. She took a step forward, and she could feel the ground under her feet.\r  \n\r  \nShe started to explore the cave, and she soon found herself in a large room. The walls were covered in strange symbols, and the floor was covered in dust. She wondered what this place was, and she wondered who had been here before.\r  \n\r  \nShe was about to turn and leave when she heard a noise. She turned around, and she saw a figure standing in the shadows. The figure was tall and thin, and it was wearing a black cloak. The girl couldn't see its face, but she could feel its eyes watching her.\r  \n\r  \nThe figure stepped forward, and the girl saw that it was a woman. The woman had long black hair and pale skin, and her eyes were a deep blue. She looked at the girl and smiled.\r  \n\r  \n\"Welcome,\" she said. \"I have been waiting for you.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe girl was confused. \"Who are you?\" she asked.\r  \n\r  \n\"I am the guardian of this cave,\" the woman said. \"I have been here for centuries, and I have seen many things come and go.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe girl was still confused, but she was also intrigued. \"What is this place?\" she asked.\r  \n\r  \n\"This is a place of power,\" the woman said. \"It is a place where magic can be found.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe girl was amazed. \"Magic?\" she asked.\r  \n\r  \n\"Yes,\" the woman said. \"Magic is real, and it is here.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe girl didn't know what to say. She had never believed in magic before, but now she was starting to wonder.\r  \n\r  \n\"Can I learn magic?\" she asked.\r  \n\r  \n\"Of course,\" the woman said. \"I will teach you everything you need to know.\"\r  \n\r  \nAnd so, the girl began her journey into magic. She learned how to cast spells, how to read runes, and how to harness the power of the elements. She learned about the history of magic, and she learned about the different types of magic that existed.\r  \n\r  \nThe more she learned, the more she realized that magic was a complex and powerful force. It could be used for good or for evil, and it could be used to help people or to hurt them.\r  \n\r  \nThe girl was determined to use her magic for good. She wanted to help people, and she wanted to make the world a better place.\r  \n\r  \nShe knew that her journey would be long and difficult, but she was determined to succeed. She was determined to learn everything she could about magic, and she was determined to use her magic to make the world a better place.\n\n\\-bard",

            "comment": "This looks like a fun thread. \n\nI'm going to try to answer your question in a slightly different way, coming from a amateur fire science background. \n\nSo the only state of matter that actually burns is gases. That seems counter intuitive. \n\nBut why is gasoline so dangerous? Because it turns to vapor at room temp. Pour out a cup of gasoline on the ground and it's super dangerous. Take a sealed 50 gallon metal drum of gasoline and put a propane torch to the outside, and it won't do anything until the walls of the drum fail. (And it leaks out and turns to vapor)\n\nWood being a solid needs to get hot enough to off gas. This is called pyrolysis. \n\nThere are three factors usually affecting whether a pieve if wood is a good candidate for burning. \n\n1) mass vs. surface area. Aka its easier to light a sliver of wood vs. a log. \n\n2) Water content. Aka, the wood can't burn if all the energy is being absorbed by the water. \n\n3) Access to oxygen. People will \"crowd\" a fire with lots of large logs, reducing oxygen from getting to the flames. \n\nYou can't take a propane torch all day to a freshly cut tree stump and it will never actually burn. The outside may char, but it won't actually be a self sustaining fire. \n\nIn your case, you have taken care of all three factors. You're mass is small compared to you're surface area. Your wood is dry and with low water content. You are holding the splinter in the air. \n\nSo yes. It will light. And if you expose it to the source of heat long enough, it should start off gassing and being self sustaining.",

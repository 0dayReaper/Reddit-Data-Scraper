    "postText": "Are there any wilderness survival games that teach or simulate with great detail various aspects of survival? For example, not just click a fire and ignite but learning how to make a hand-drill, finding suitable tinder or wax, or learning how to tie a rope to secure a rock to a stick, learning plants and trees and what sort of wood is suitable for tool-making.\n\nI\u2019ve played Green Hell and The Long Dark and wonder if there are games even more realistic. Obviously I can just do it in real life, but learning through a game is more fun and it\u2019s like a simulation for the real thing.",

They also just came out with sons of the forest which might be better. \n\nIf you know nothing about the wilderness i\u2019d say definitely check out the forest or sons of the forest on steam. and if you don\u2019t like scary things just turn it to peaceful mode, you\u2019ll build a fire to stay warm and build a shelter outta the trees you cut down. you kill animals and make certain clothing or equipment and even get meat and have to cook it on the fire. You will learn how to survive if you crash on an island like the movie cast away with wilson",

Hell, it was terrible to do in person, with all the supplies, ready to go, and trying for half an hour live. Nothing replaces working with an expert and actually doing it out there. Maybe a video game can get you some of the knowledge, but the actual technique is more nuanced for drills at least. Striking a metal match - sure. Flint and steel, a little harder, but could be represented. Bow drill? Make sure in the video game that you work on it for at least 15 minutes just spinning the spindle back and forth before you get that tiny little ember and watch it go out before you work another 15 minutes.",

Rimworld is a good colony sim, will teach you about farming to a degree and will learn leadership and management qualities. \nIf colony sims are your thing and want to learn something educational, try Oxygen Not Included. Learn about gasses and engineering \n\nIf you want to learn to make a fire, just go camping. Find a nice trail near you and see if there is a campsite or private land that would let you do campfires.",

But I always trip myself up wondering what it is that I don't know about that is safe for ravens to eat, that isn't safe for me to eat. I mean, Ravens may lead me to a good source of nutrients, but how do I know that it's a source that is safe for me and able to be processed by my body?",

We tried to hike north to find the trail I knew was somewhere north of us to emergency evacuate. Didn't end up finding it, but by then the wind storm was a full on blizzard. Almost white out conditions, and we were soaked.\n\nThe snow killed the wind, so we decided the best way to find our emergency route was to get back on the water and find where the trail met a creek, and we could hike out from there.  \n\nOn the water in our pack rafts, eventually the snow slowed down enough to have some visibility.  I saw a pair of ravens leave shore, so we followed them knowing they would be looking for food in campsites. They led us straight to a campsite where the trail met the creek and our exit route.\n\nAt that point, my GF was hypothermic and had stopped shivering.  We stopped to set up camp, and we warmed up in our down quilts for an hour or two before we hiked out and hitchhiked back to our truck",

In experiments, they have shown they can solve problems, remember how people treated them, and plan for future events.\n\nI was just saying that you were smart about how to solve the problem by taking a risk that paid off. It was either that or die.",

If you see or smell any sign of a carcass, including circling ravens/vultures, steer clear of the area. There have been a number of bear attacks, including some fatal, that have been determined to be related to the victim getting near a cache. It's also fairly common for the bear to still be in the area defending their kill when rangers respond to a bear attack fatalities.\n\n Wild wolf attacks are exceptionally rare compared to bear attacks, which are still very uncommon.",

I don\u2019t know much more but am meeting with him soon and will provide an update on the courses he offers. \n\nHe does have a podcast that talks about different situations and skills, it\u2019s called \u201cAdvanced Wilderness Life Support\u201d on Spotify, no certifications are given of course but he\u2019s a very reputable source- medical control for S&amp;R and former asst. dean of medicine at the university",

The content is good, although I  would recommend it more as a refresher. Much better than no training.\n\nI have also done NOLS in person courses twice. Expensive but absolutely top notch.",

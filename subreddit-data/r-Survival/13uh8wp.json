I am based in Western Australia and am pretty new to the survival community, the only really big tool shop we have here is bunnings and generally the stuff isn't super reliable there.\nI'm looking for any recommendations for hunting/survival knives, foraging tools and garden equipment. \n\nI'm happy to drop a bit of coin and have been maintaining my kitchen equipment with whetstone for a while.\n\nIf you have any suggestions then please let me know!",

I have the technobee that I bought basically to test their stainless and they do a good job. BPS are also affordable.\n\nI'd say until you're confident with sharpening (unless you're already good at it) stick with a more affordable knife. High end knives are good at holding an edge... but every knife dulls, and if you can't get it sharp in the first place there's no point in buying a super steel expensive knife.\n\nBro... I'd kill for a kangaroo steak!",

It's a Tramontina Bolo, with the terrible factory rust proofing stripped off and the edge reprofiled as well as a PVC sheath. Use it all the time and absolutely love it.\n\nBunnings/BCF/etc should carry Fiskars gear, and most of it is pretty good especially for the price. The XS (extra small) axe in particular has a very good reputation - light weight, durable, cuts well, comes with a very nice edge protector with an integrated carry handle. My Fiskars saw is pretty good too, though not as good as the axe.",

Whatever knife you get, it's a good idea to get one with a 90 degree spine. That means the back of the spine is flat and has sharp corners, these can be used for all sorts of things including shaving bark/wood for kindling. I honestly wouldn't go for a machete unless you live somewhere really overgrown (like a jungle) as aimlessly hacking away at vegetation is kind of a dick move. A good knife will have 100 uses, but if you don't have the skills to utilize all these uses, then it won't do much for you, so education and practice are as important as the knife you pick if not more so.",

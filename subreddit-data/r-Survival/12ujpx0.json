    "postText": "Okay, so this is a silly question but I'm hoping you all will have an answer. My friend and I have been watching Dual Survivor and we started playing around with building fires. He bought us some magnesium fire starters online and while we were able to shave the metal and create sparks, we failed to get a whole fire going. So here's my question - under what circumstances would someone want to use a magnesium fire starter versus (dare I say it) just carrying a lighter? I do a lot of solo hiking, cycling and camping and I thought making a fire might be a good skill to have in case I ever end up in a weird situation. Thank you!",

All while not smothering it.",

I read a little bit through this forum and it seems like it makes more sense to bring storm matches, a lighter and some Vaseline soaked cotton balls. I still don't understand the advantage of the magnesium fire starter over the cotton balls and other methods people mentioned.",

One solid item, lightweight, can pack and store just about anywhere, no moving parts, can get totally soaked and still function, provides dozens to hundreds of uses before depleting.\n\nThe disadvantage is in the prep time and reliance on proper dry material for fuel. Spark stick sucks when *everything* is soaked.",

            "comment": "A Bic lighter is better for most situations. If you drop it in water, it will float. Just blow hard down into it and you will clear the water out of the mechanism, and it will light again. Once the fuel is depleted, the sparker can still be used if you have dry fluffy tinder such as cotton balls with Vaseline. For the average person, this is the best solution as long as you make sure the lever can't be compressed and you lose all your fuel. (Some people put a zip-tie around the top of the lighter, under the fuel lever, so that it can't be depressed while it's in your pack. To use it, you have to remove the zip-tie.)\n\nThe edge case of the magnesium fire starter is if your kit is going to remain in a survival kit for years. Or maybe it's in a cache somewhere getting damp for a long time. You need to be able to reliably make sparks and light the magnesium shavings 100% of the time, for hundreds or thousands of fires. That part is easy. The other part is the prep work for the tinder, as the other person commented.\n\nIf ultralight weight is not a concern, having multiple ways to start a fire will be invaluable, because your survival conditions are unpredictable. Having a Bic lighter, stormproof matches, and a ferro rod or magnesium/ferro bar are a really solid combo. Add in some tinder and you are all set.",

That is not very easy, but mankind did it for thousands of years.  \n\nThe magnesium part is sort of a modern \"cheat\" way of staring a fire with flint.  If you want to learn a traditional and historic way of making fire, try doing it without the magnesium and just use basic flint and steal  It is not easy, and is in fact a very advanced skill.",

            "comment": "Plain magnesium blocks are not worth the trouble. Ferro rods have magnesium mixed into the alloy anyway, you need some tinder that catches that spark. Waxed jute is good, especially with a tube to use it as a tinder wick.\n\nYes, making a fire is a critical skill you should have before you any kind of solo wilderness activity. Start with a bic lighter though and learn to make fires in all conditions with them and then add other starters to your toolkit",

Red kangaroos i didn't know either,, although I'm not some idiot that goes up to big ass animals, i now know that swimming away is not the answer. Elephants common sense (the hangout by thier butts thing goes for anything on four legs that's bigger than a dog). Siberian tiger, makes sense as they are ambush predators. Gorillas... not sure that's the best route, but I do know if they charge, stay there and don't make eye contact or any moves.",

And they can go a little slower than that (but still faster than almost any other animal) indefinitely. They cover vast distances in the wild. You've got zero chance of out running a kangaroo if it comes after you - unless you can climb into a car/house/etc.\n\nA fully grown male red kangaroo is also *huge* and while they're not especially heavy (200 pounds?) it's all muscle with zero fat. Unlike predators which might need to store up food for a long winter, Kangaroos eat all day long every day of their life. They have no fat reserves. And they're a prey animal that fights just to prove to their peers that they're the baddest kangaroo int he area, which means they might attack you just because they want other kangaroos to see them beat you in a fight.\n\nThey normally stick to fighting each other, but they do sometimes fight humans and while killing someone is very rare they are definitely capable of causing serious injury (and that happens quite often).\n\nThe \"don't swim with them\" advice is mostly a joke, but that is how they prefer to kill predators. Kangaroos fight for dominance in their social pecking order, but it's also the duty of the larger males to protect young by killing predators, and they will actively try to lure predators into the water for a swim with them, even though they can easily outrun any predator, they will still risk injury by trying to kill anything that would be a threat to a smaller member of their mob.",

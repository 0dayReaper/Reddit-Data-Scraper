It's cheap, light, reasonably durable, and very compact. Getting a cheap tarp for practice purposes isn't bad. The minimum size for a person is 5'x8', but I would say go 6'x9' or 8'x10'. Standard paracord or bank line for tie-outs isn't bad for practice. 1.1 to 1.9oz/sqyd silnylon or silpoly is the sweet spot for an emergency tarp, around 20d to 30d denier thickness is good. This is lighter, more packable, and longer lasting than cheaper but thicker and heavier polyurethane alternatives... Unless it's just for practicing to see if you want a tarp to begin with.

Ideally you want a shelter lifted off of you but folding it over you like a clamshell will work if it starts to rain in the middle of the night. Before laying on the end of your tarp ready to clamshell if it rains or you need extra warmth, you'll want to fold the corner doen at your head and the corner up at your feet. Otherwise the rain drips off the tarp above you back inside the tarp and it will roll under you and collect and soak you.  The tarp has a cleanside (toward you) and a dirty side toward the ground.  Fold the tarp a little differently each day, don't make holes by reusing the same fold seems daily. You will learn all this on your own.",

Silicone coated fabrics are more reliable for long term storage than pu or other organics that degrade. The stretch of silnylon makes it resistant to punctures, easy to pitch, and quiet in the wind. Main downside is that it sags when wet. Silpoly doesn\u2019t have the sagging problem but is a bit more susceptible to punctures due to less stretch. Silpoly for shelter and silnylon for groundsheet is a pretty good combo. 30d is a good balance of lightweight but still durable.",

When at home cut it to your desired length, remember to leave it a little longer than what you measure by a couple of inches. Buy some grommets and gorilla tape too. Once you\u2019re set on measurements, stuff it in your washer machine for two cycles. Hang to dry. Then stuff it in your dryer for 1 cycle. It will come out soft and durable. Works great as a ground cover and a tarp, even an emergency blanket! On the extra 2 inches go all the way around the parameter with gorilla tape. Then fold that piece over, and sew it in place. (The gorilla tape gives a little support and thickness to the tyvek) then flip it over once and sew it in place. Now you have the perfect edge. When you\u2019re ready place the grommets and boom you have yourself a multi-purpose ground cover/tarp that\u2019s super lightweight and durable. With a value of $75-$100",

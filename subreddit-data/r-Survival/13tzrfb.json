And not ONE g\\*dd\\*mn time could I get that f\\*cker to light.  There is info out there.  Plenty of Youtube vids...etc.  I am pretty sure you want to stay away from resinous woods like pine and whether the spindle and bearing block is hard or soft wood also affects things.  That's all I know about it.",

They didn\u2019t have fire starters so they must have a reliable way to make fire with the tropical woods available. I guess I\u2019m more into primitive tools than using modern ones.",

Well they dried wood and carried around a little fire starter set which included dried pieces of wood and dry flammable materials. But different people used different things. Flint was also an easy option.",

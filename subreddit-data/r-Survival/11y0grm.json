Which got me thinking why do we try and increase the size of our calf muscles when they seem to not be able to do so? Is it due to an evolutionary trait where smaller calves help with king distance running?",

You can do all those activities with weak calves, but you\u2019re not gonna have a good time.\n\nLike most muscles, size isn\u2019t important, strength and endurance are.  For non-gym bros, it\u2019s function over form.  The calves are one of the hardest muscles to train to hypertrophy because of their inherent strength and the short lever that they pull, so a gym bro wears his massive calves as a badge of honor \u2014 it means he\u2019s more dedicated than his chicken-leg contemporaries.  But, for us normies that seek better, stronger, longer, and more efficient function, training them in conjunction with an overall strength and endurance program is worthwhile.

The only thing that will get wet is the fireplace but with a good fire it won't be a problem. If you live in an area where it rains extremely much you could build a \"chimney hat\" and put on top of the shelter but I've never needed to do that. This is the fourth shelter like this I've built and it haven't been a problem yet. \ud83d\udc4d",

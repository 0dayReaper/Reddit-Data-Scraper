Using a tarp, branches and paracord, carving or improvising a paddle.\n\n- Shelter building challenge, losers of some challenges have to sleep in them as a forfeit.\n\n- Edible insects can be ordered online to ensure for grade standards as other forfeits.",

Watch the pros at https://youtu.be/qQgwNqJTZJo\n\nHere\u2019s my instructions \n\n**KETTLE BOIL**\n\nKettle Boil Competition at _______location_______\n\nDescription:  Sled team works together to boil 2 cups of water using two 2x4s and a book of matches.  Team with shortest time gets 100 points, second shortest 98 points, etc.; every pot that boils get some points.  Typical time: 1 hour, fastest 15 minutes.\nSled Team Equipment:  very sharp hachet(s), knives (preferably sheath knife), mallet (or log), gloves, and much lighting if at night.  If raining, rig a tarp or use umbrellas, and bring a platform to keep tinder dry.  No fire starters or other flammables allowed.  \nTown Mayor Equipment: pop-up shelter from rain, hanging area lighting, cut wood for 80 teams, many books of matches, many #10 cans, 2x pump dish detergent bottles, 2-cup measuring cup, jugs of water, chopping platforms (old wood flooring boards), smartphones not watches for time, 11x9\u201d aluminum pans from Sam\u2019s for burning platform (if on grass or wet), 2 rolls aluminum foil, FAK, plastic tubs to hold all, and some audaciously marked tools for loan.  All gear waterproofed and box of trash bags (for hypothermic Scouts) in case of cold or rain.\nRequirements:  This event is NOT about starting a fire, rather it\u2019s about building and tending a fire.  A team will break down dry pine 6x2x4\u201d and 12x2x4\u201d blocks into kindling, tinder, and fuel, arrange them to heat a #10 tin can, and then light the wood.  Time starts when they first split the wood and sends when the soap water is bubbling.   Team will extinguish the fire, clean up the area, return tools, and put waste into the fire ring / pit.  \nScore Sheet:  In 6 columns, list Troop number, sled team name/number, start time in minutes:seconds, boil time in minutes:seconds, points (to be filled out at end), and notes.  Turn into HQ at end.",

We have played it a few times at park days or house parties. \n\nYou need a rope to set up the \u201carena\u201d, 2 blind folds and a bunch of beers. Teams of two are blind folded and put in the arena and they have to roll around and find the \u201chidden\u201d beers in the arena. You can\u2019t take off the blind fold until you find all beers. At that point you can start drinking them, and the time ends when all \u201cfound\u201d beers are discovered and consumed. It\u2019s a riot",

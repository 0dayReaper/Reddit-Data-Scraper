            "comment": "Never touched one but just looked them up.   \nLook to me like an absolute gimmick. Avoid.  \nThere\u2019s a big gap between Survival fantasy and survival reality.   \nThe reality is that no matter how skilled and practised you are a real \u2018life and death\u2019 emergency situation has a good chance of killing you. So you should use all your intelligence, knowledge and planning skills to avoid getting into a real survival situation.   \nDon\u2019t get lost, don\u2019t take stupid risks, don\u2019t get wet and cold.   \nSurvival fantasy is another thing. Practising skills and having fun challenging ourselves to do things _we should hope never to have to do for real_.   \nIf you want a simple, purely practical knife that\u2019s cheap,  buy a Mora with a plastic handle and sheath.   \nIf you want a knife you\u2019ll love, buy one very similar looking with a wooden handle and leather sheath so it ages and becomes unique and you can feed the leather and oil the handle etc.   \nAvoid anything with a saw back, steep blade angles, multi angle blades, cord wrapped handles or that\u2019s trying to look like a zombie killer.",

Try the Morakniv, it\u2019s lighter, sharp, takes a beating and is very reasonably priced. I\u2019ve shaved wood, carved fire boards, hooks, pegs, gutted fish, chopped veggies and Battonned wood and it still keeps going.",

            "comment": "I mean... in comparison to nothing it would be fantastic haha\n\nSo, general purpose survival knife. The must haves would be durability, a good handle, good sheath, and easy to maintain. The nice to haves would be stainless, edge stability, edge holding (wear resistance... but not at the detriment of maintainability IE ease of sharpening), affordability, and the right size/shape to do jobs specific to an environment/situation. The last one you'll have to answer when picking a knife. \n\nBig knife? Kukri or a machete (get a martindale). Usually when people think \"survival knife\" they want a big honkin chopper.  They're not stainless but in like a jungle environment it's invaluable.\n\nMedium belt knife? https://a.co/d/8GSeUpK This one takes the cake for me. It's a good steel, 14c28n, which is very tough, not too bad to sharpen, holds its edge well, and is stainless. It has a blade shape that is very versatile, and has a good sheath. It's also only $40 which is a steel\n\nSmall knife? Well first you might ask why a small knife? Because it's easy to carry and having it with you when you need it is the most important part of this whole scenario. I'd get something like one of these two: https://thompsonsknives.com/enzonecker.html (bottom one with kydex) https://a.co/d/eNKsNe1 These will be able to do most tasks, comfortable to wear pretty much 24/7 (pair with an ulticlip for pocket/belt/waistband/swim trunk carry), and will be less likely to be without it when you need it.",

            "comment": "Tanto Trackers are very pretty knives, not very practical, but pretty.   \nDefinitely Not the knife I would carry in a survival situation. As for general-purpose survival knives. Well... erm... what's your environment? is it your only cutting tool? What are you comfortable/experienced using?   \n\n\nIn a jungle or swamp, I would recommend carrying a machete. A Tramontina would do great.  \nFor high humidity areas such as coastal areas, and as a hunting knife, camp knife and general purpose survival knife, a Buck 119 as its perfect for dressing game and rust resistant.  \nIn a forest, bushcrafting kind of survival scenario, a Mora or ESEE. Easy to sharpen, durable.  \n\n\nIf you are new to the outdoors and want to start learning survival skills, buy a MORA, learn how to carve with it, sharpen it, what you expect out of it. It's very cheap, quite durable, very versatile, and tbh, the first knife you get you will probably wreck as you practice sharpening it in the field. Mors Kochanski carried a Mora around his neck for years while teaching survival skills. So you can be assured that it is an excellent survival knife.",

It is reasonably priced, is suitable for all environments, and will do everything a knife was designed to do. Except for baton, Please do NOT baton your Buck 119.  The Buck 119 was the hunters/survivalists knife of choice for decades. So it is a tried and tested knife.   \n\n\nIf you absolutely must baton, I recommend the ESEE 4. although it will rust, so you must take care to oil it.",

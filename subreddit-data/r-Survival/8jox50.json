This same spot also had 3-4 smallish vine maples on the uphill slope, and several larger alders in front. \n\nI built a simple frame, main crossbar running horizontally across the alders in front, and supported the ends and center with stakes that had forked tops so I wouldn\u2019t need as much line. \n\nThen bent the vine maples in the back over in to a roof frame, spread the small limbs out and tied/wove them on to the main horizontal brace in front. I then wove in the branches and smaller ends of the young trees I am using for poles to the roof frame. After that just harvested and overlapped sword ferns and started thatching. \n\nIf it was a really bad downpour, I would get somewhat damp. It was drizzling while I was building this, and after it was done it was staying dry under.\n\nTLDR: about 20 feet of fishing line was used, tried to keep it minimal. Threw this together in about 1.5 hours. Not the best but darkness approached. \n",

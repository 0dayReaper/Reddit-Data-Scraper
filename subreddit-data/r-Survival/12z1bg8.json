(It took me weeks to catch my first fish)\n\nBut never give up! With the stakes so high, once I finally solved the fishing conundrum it became some of the most fun fishing I\u2019ve had, with days catching multiple monsters on my little bushcraft rod and reel setup: made all the more exciting by the not-so-subtle threat of eventual starvation if you don\u2019t! \n\nI never let my foot off the gas and fished ( and trapped and hunted) every day until ice came in, and then switched to ice fishing!  You are either moving forward or backwards and there is no more tangible and direct example of that than watching your food supply shrink or grow: the only clear measure of whether you are truly thriving or just slowly starving. \n\nBut fish where a welcome addition to the smorgasbord in the food cache: and I knew as long as that cache was growing I didn\u2019t have to wonder what everyone else was doing, I could just focus on being sustainable myself: then my only concern could be how long would I be away from the family.. through Christmas? 6 months? A year?  ",

I would imagine quite a lot, since to salt-cure you need to completely coat something in salt. \n\nBut yeah, also I was asking if salt refined from ocean water in that area would be safe to eat. Aren't there heavy metals in the water depending on where you are? I would think that refining large amounts of sea water to get the solids would get things other than the salt.",

I have all the shows on my computer too as well as Les's entire boxed CD set, but live in the real world and stop playing Mr. Dressup .....\n\n\r  \n\\-  You go on a  show like that knowing exactly what\u2019s gonna happen, in fact you signed up for it.\n\n\r  \n\\-  There are regular medical checkup's and they give everyone a freaking SAT phone and a SPOT so they can tap out.\n\n\r  \n\\- As a contestant YOU know for a fact - that they know exactly where you are.\n\n\r  \n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r  \nIn the real world  (which none of the kids on here live in these days)  you go out for the day or the week or maybe two weeks.\n\n\r  \n\\-  You're going mtn biking, or canoe tripping, or backpacking, or hunting, you're NOT going out to practice or pretend you're playing Survivorman.  \n\n\r  \n\\-  You're just going out to do something outdoors for fun ........\n\n\r  \n\\-  Hopefully you played your cards right, and you're not completely stupid, and you filed a flight plan with fam and friends - people know what you're up to.\n\n\r  \n\\-  Then hey presto - something happens and you're nice big pack of gear goes poof !  It's just freaken gone OK? and you now have, you're belt knife and what's in your pockets and that's it Skippy.\n\n\r  \nThat is a real-world emergency survival situation, not some made for TV movie.  \n\n\\- no gear - no food - except what's in your jacket pockets\n\n\\-  maybe your injured \n\n\\- no one knows where you are exactly \n\n\\- you can't communicate anyone \n\n\\- and if you're lucky, you have an idea of where in the hell you actaully are and you   \n  aren't really lost  \n\nThat is what survival is - you can \"practice it and pretend\" al you want but it's never gonna be close to the real thing.  Get lost one day for real, you'll notice how quickly the panic comes on ...... and it takes quite a bit to control it.\n\n Hopefully you never have to find out.

Most of the time, there's no REAL danger for the contestants.  They have the option to quit whenever they want, or they can get pulled when it's deemed too unsafe for them to continue. It's entertainment, and the makers of this show still have the legal responsibility to make sure people make it home after they're done. You're missing the point though.  \n\nThey still risk injury and several months of health issues, post show, due to real starvation, injuries, parasites etc... They're still thrown into a situation where there's a real chance of encounters with dangerous animals. The skills they show off and practice are legitimate skills, that any person can learn and use, should the unfortunate circumstance happen and they need to.  There's an educational aspect to this you're totally missing by thinking this is just LARP camping.  The things that are shown on this show, the skills the contestants share, can save your life if you're you're lost and are limited on resources. There is real value in that. Knowing what to do when you're faced with a serious situation will stop most people from making panicked decisions, so they'll stop and think about the situation, and how to get through it.  I'd argue that shows like Survivorman do a better job because he's put in realistic situations with items you'd commonly have in those situations, but there's value in it nonetheless. It's helped me when I've gotten legitimately lost in the woods before. \n\nYou're not wrong, but you've got a narrow viewpoint of what these shows are",

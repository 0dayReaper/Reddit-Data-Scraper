    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm planning a trip to a forest and I want to be well-prepared. What are the essential things I need to know about surviving in a forest? This includes understanding the necessary conditions and factors for survival, such as water sources, shelter, and other important considerations. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Survival skills are great for the short term, but you will not survive forever.\n\n\n1 in the wild is fire, unless you\u2019re in a desert, in which case it\u2019s water and shelter. Learn to make fire from what you plan to bring out, and from the resources available to you in the wild. I\u2019d recommend learning to shave wood, working your way towards feathersticks (named because the shavings make the stick look like a feather). This is one of the easiest ways to make tinder from your surroundings. You\u2019ll want to be able to make sparks or embers, sparks are often going to be from ferrocerium rods like those found in a lighter, or \u2018flint and steel\u2019 firestarters and embers you can make using wood drill methods (bow drill is most common). Wood drill methods require knowing the types of wood in your area, which are hardwoods and which are softwoods, and where they\u2019re used in the drill setup.\n\n2 is water sources. Bring water. If you end up lost out there, remember all water runs downhill. If you go downhill too, you\u2019ll find a stream/river. *I will NOT recommend drinking straight from the stream*, giardia, e. Coli, or something else will wreak havoc on you. But if you *absolutely* need to drink runoff water, find the fastest, highest stream you can. The higher, the less ground it\u2019s come in contact with since it fell as precipitation. The faster it\u2019s moving, the less tolerable it is for parasites, or for insects to lay eggs.",

The process of the water filtering up from the dirt allows for filtration..not guaranteed no Guardia but in a life and death thing, it's pretty safe. But I'm not sure if I'm remembering the steps perfectly...wonder if there's supposed to be small rocks added to the bottom??

Anti inflammatory gel, support bandage, blister pads.   \nIf you\u2019re going far from other people and out of cell phone reception consider buying or renting a PLB.  \nDon\u2019t play with hatchets.",

Yet, you take a big risk drinking from streams, so get one of those survival filter straws so you can drink from streams safely if you run out of your carry water. Trying to go on with only small sips of simply too little water might help with thirst, but not with collapsing down the road: too little water intake is too little, no way around it. Shelter from cold, shelter from direct sun (need a hat??).\n\nHow will you clean up after shitting? Uncomfortable topic to many, important question. You want to dig a hole for whenever you have to go, though you can do this with a stick from the woods, and cover up after. But you do need to clean yourself, so perhaps (fully biodegradeable!!!!) wipes and disinfectant gel. I recommend also carrying a bar of soap.\n\nOh, and fires. Put them out. Like seriously put them out. The fire can go on without a flame, smoldering inside of the ground under where you had a utility fire, spreading then into a wildfire after you're gone.",

            "comment": "A way to navigate is essential. Most people use their phones (which work great) but you'll at least want a way to charge it while out there, and I would also highly recommend a mirrored compass as well. You can use it to figure out your bearings, and the mirror can double as a signaling method if you find yourself in a position to do that. I've got a Suunto, but Silva also makes good ones. Learn how to use the compass before you go. (If you get lost it really is best if you just stay put, just make sure you tell people where you're gonna go and stick to your plan.)\n\nYou're gonna want a way to get water if you end up being out longer than expected. You will need a filter, iodine tablets, or you can just boil it. Pretty simple. I like Sawyer Squeeze filters, but there are UV filters and all sorts of options out there.\n\nSpeaking of boiling, you will also want to bring a lighter (or two) and a ferro-rod or matches as a backup. Keep a ziploc bag with these things and as much dryer lint as you can compress into it. Dryer lint combusts really well and is easily available.\n\nYou will want synthetic clothing. **Do not wear cotton**, especially if there is an expectation that you will get wet/sweaty. Synthetic fabrics wick away moisture, cotton holds it. Merino socks. I'd pack extra clothes just in case you get wet. Learn about proper layering.\n\nYou will also need some sort of shelter. A tarp is easy enough, even the blue ones that are available at most stores will work. You'll want some cordage (paracord is what I use) to tie it off in order to secure it and make it into a shelter. Speaking of your shelter, am emergency bivvy, emergency blankets, or some kind of synthetic/down sleeping bag/quilt.\n\nA first aid kit is a pretty smart idea. I'd throw some sunscreen and bug spray in there for good measure.\n\nFood's nice, but you can go a long time without it. That's your call. Never hurts having some extra, but I personally take minimal amounts of food. I like to make pb&amp;j rolls (just pb&amp;j on tortillas) if I take food at all. Some candy isn't a bad idea either, maybe some electrolyte powder.\n\nA headlamp or flashlight is nice as well. Extra batteries are also good to have. If you do find yourself stranded out there, it's probably best if you just hunker down overnight, but you're still gonna be glad you have a light source, just in case.\n\nHighly recommend a fixed blade knife or folding saw, but I wouldn't necessarily say that they are essential. There is potential for injury when using them, so weigh your options.",

If you use forest water, you can carry it with a bucket. If you're making fire and it's very dry or ground is mostly dry turf, you can fill bucket with sand or water so you can douse the fire if something goes wrong. If it rains, you can collect rainwater, and if ground is damp, you can keep your need-to-reach-often stuff in it - like tools or whatever so they won't get wet. Bucket also helps with collecting tinder and smaller firewood, mushrooms, whatever. And you can take your trash away after you're done - in a bucket. If you decide to buy a bucket, make sure it has quite thick walls and well-attached, non-bending handle that won't come off if bucket is full of water or sand. There's all sorts of cheap Chinese shit at the stores that break at first chance. Bucket like this looks like [a total piece of crap](https://imgur.com/a/KkCP7yf) - thin handle and weak handle connection, while [this](https://imgur.com/a/4p8PQmt) looks much sturdier.\n\n\n* Don't chill nor put your shelter under dead trees\n\n* Don't sit under a tree during a lighting storm\n\n* Don't put your tent or shelter in a hole or lower part of the ground. It'll get wet if it rains or if ground is wet in \ngeneral\n\n* Don't try to turn your life into a dumb reality show and make shelter under trunk of a big fallen tree\n\n* After setting up shelter/tent and making your bed, *lie* on it for good 10 minutes, and try to turn from side to side. To make sure it's *actually* soft and good. You can't fix a bad bed in the middle of night and sleepless night will ruin your next day.\n\n* The water boiling stuff you see on endless survival shows and from other \"experts\" usually refers to some dead ass desert in Arizona or wild jungle in Indonesia with parasites or pollution levels little known to science, but still applies to most natural water sources. \nGenerally in Europe - if water comes from a spring in the ground in a clean, nice forest in a huge national park, it's likely quite safe. If from river, not so much, since it collects pollution from farms, highways and factories it passes. Lakes are questionable and so are swamps. Stagnant water is always very dangerous. Also natural water tends to be cleaner the higher you are, since pollution mostly collects at the bottom (valleys, flatlands, such). Act accordingly.\n\n* Spare nature. Don't cut or hack live trees if you have no need to\n\n* When messing with any tree, always first look up, to make sure you're not knocking down a wasp, bird or or any other sort of nest.\n\n* It applies to everything else, too. Check before you act. Stomp on things, thy to shake them violently, so forth. Before you make a move, make sure you won't get screwed by physics and bad luck. No matter if you're building a shelter, trying to cross a stream via fallen log or whatever. Check first.\n\n* Use landmarks. Camp somewhere, where you can see a landmark (a mountain, a radio tower, whatever) so you always know where you are and about which way is back. Or at least could call for help and they can orient by that landmark.\n\n* Don't leave any food out for night! The smell will attract every living being in the area, including all the insects\n\n* It's a good idea to know where you're going and what the typical wind direction is at the place and time of year. It's quite annoying to set up a campfire, only to find all the smoke coming towards your tent or whatever. If you still mess up, you can build some sort of makeshift wind wall safe distance away from fire.\n\n* I don't know how weather is in Spain, but in five days, a lot of things could happen. I'd bring a bath-sized towel in a plastic bag (packed so it survives heavy rain or falling into river). You can use it to dry yourself, as extra cover if your legs are cold, makeshift pillow or scarf, bandage, mosquito screen, whatever.\n\n* If you go alone, bring a power bank and put your phone in battery saving mode. At no time should you be without chance to call for help.\n\n* Don't climb on shit. There's absolutely nothing you need in steep, rocky areas. There's no foraging, no firewood, no pretty plants to look at. Only about million chances to break your leg, twist your ankle, scrape your knee or fall badly.",

Being wet with nothing to do about it is worst way to be.\nI hike a lot in northern temperate climate during spring and a big, warm and dry towel has saved a bad day more than once. One time I went too early, wearing only short trunks and a light jumper, and had to spend night in a windy bus shelter in the middle of nowhere, while temperature dipped below 0\u00b0C (which isn't normal in May, but happened). About 4AM, woke up hell of a hypothermia, and my body refused to move, brain was pretty much giving up and I didn't have anything to wear, other than towel I packed in hopes of trying to dip in a lake somewhere. Wrapped it around my neck like a scarf and warmed up. Survival, more or less. I was quite amazed how hypothermia took nearly all of my willpower and brain was really ready to die.\n\nI don't know who Roosta is or whatever you referenced here.",

There is no such thing as bad weather, just bad gear. A towel wasn't going to help. Start dry, stay dry, know how to dry out. \n\nA towel bag is actually helpful gear. A small trash bag will keep stuff dry that needs to stay dry like a sleeping bag, down jacket, and sacred socks, etc.. Cut a head hole a large bag and it's a poncho to keep you dry. I never go to the wilderness without one. \n\nI have witnessed hypothermia in others, it made them stupid, and they were no longer able to help themselves.\n\nI'm not going to start on the bucket as survival gear as I'm not convinced that this entire subreddit the robots discovered for me last night isn't /s",

When I go to forest, it's usually to forage mushrooms and/or just chill and drink beer with my friends while tenting for couple days. Forests around my home are made of super dry turf, that can ignite even underground and burn for months and there's fuck all you can do about it if you let it happen. \n\nSo I usually do take a bucket, for reasons I explained. Most likely, it starts out filled with ice, barbecue meat and beer bottles :) and ends up with our trash or mushrooms on the way back. In-between, it works as emergency fire extinguisher. You can also sit on it if you turn it over or use as a table surface for preparing food, and keep metal stuff in it (a good camper wouldn't drop axe in  wet moss). It can also save a backpack if it suddenly starts to rain and you have no shelter to hide the backpack in yet. It's also more comfortable for firewood, because sticks and twigs aren't most uniform objects and it's easier to carry them in a bucket, rather than awkwardly try to carry them in hands and spill them all around. And, plastic is easy to clean and waterproof. A wonder material. Try it!\n\nHypothermia is crazy as fuck. You know what's happening, you know that you're fucked, and **yet** your body and brain is like \"fuck it\". And you *know it's wrong and DO DO DO SOMETHING* but your hands and feet just won't move. I don't suggest serious hypothermia to anyone. It's awakening and conscious-expanding experience, but unlike LSD, it rarely ends well.",

Also if it were strictly crickets/invertebrates they're mega high in protein, low in fat/carbs. Cool on the surface right? Then gains!\n\nExcept for the thermogenic properties of protein. Little bit of research I've read suggests protein actually burns more calories through the digestive process than equivalent calories of carbs/fat. Which name of the game in survival is calories vs energy expenditure.",

There are equations and studies about high-caloric and low-caloric foods, and how much energy expenditure it takes to gather a food type before the gathering becomes detrimental &amp; outweighs the caloric gains. Also if it's just you, gathering alone, your margin for error is much more slim.",

            "comment": "Very seasonal and or location dependent. You can certainly supplement your diet with insects but you arent likely to be able to get enough of them to make a majority of your diet unless theres a population explosion like with locusts.\n\nThat said, they provide a good bit of energy and vitamins for their size and weight so theres no reason not to eat them if they are available.\n\nAs far as pure subsistence foraging goes, you dont wanna overlook an easy food source even if it seems insignificant. You would meet your energy needs by eating everything remotely edible that you can get. Insects would probably make better bait for fishing but you can always eat what you dont use.\n\nThink about bears. They have a pretty similar diet to our own. They eat meat if they can but they mostly subsist on cambium, grasses, berries, sedges, insects, mushrooms, marine life, etc. Individually those things dont provide a ton of calories but if you spend hours eating them it adds up.",

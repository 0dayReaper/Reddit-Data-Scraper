We shouldn\u2019t be rude to people who come here to ask about it.\n\nThe father in the show is wrong but he probably didn\u2019t know that. He just was thinking of ways to save his daughter even at the expense of his own life. \n\nIf you\u2019re lost in the desert, find some plants. Plants need water to grow. Dig down. Filter through your shirt and drink it. Or if you do find a stream, go a few steps away from it and dig down. Again, filter through your shirt and drink. Then stay at the stream! Find some logs or something and make a signal on the ground so planes can see your message. Three huge X\u2019s in a row or triangle. \n\nPeople should start reading their survival books and not just have them on the shelf. The Boy Scout manual from before the 1990s would be a good place to start too.",

If you've got a couple ounces of human blood in your digestive system, it's probably yours, and that's never good.\n\nYou cannot drink another person's blood to stay alive.  Maybe you could drink a cow's blood.  But, really, it's the urine you should be drinking if there is absolutely no water around.  It won't speed dehydration if it's all you've got.",

The iron makes you vomit, which causes further dehydration. There are no health benefits to DRINKING blood. So many people have said it so clearly and here you are still spreading misinformation.

Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume),[3] and contains proteins, glucose and mineral ions.  \n\nThe sodium content of human blood is normally 0.9%, a safe level to drink. Acute dehydration causes the body to concentrate the urine to preserve water (except in the elderly) which has the effect of lowering the blood sodium level.   \nIt depends on what stage of dehydration the father and daughter have reached, too far advanced and blood loss might kill the father, but drinking blood would give the daughter both water and valuable salts, protein and glucose.  \n\nFor a real world example, albeit with bat blood, read this:  \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30046426",

            "comment": "It\u2019s not recommended.  The problem is that blood of any kind, but especially human blood will cause issues in the digestive track.  The body requires higher levels of moisture when digesting anything with protein.  So you are increasing your requirement for liquid while consuming a protein rich liquid that must be digested to fully use the liquid portion.  On top of that, any significant amount of blood would cause diarrhea or at very least serious upset stomach.  Blood, while marginally nutritious in a desperate situation is not a drink that is going to prolong life.  Nutritionally it is possible for the healthy body to go out as much as 60 days without food (though this will have serious consequences) and the person with a need for water should focus on that alone until they find a source and are safe from dehydration.\nUrine has also been suggested but really only the first flow of urine is useful.  By the time it has passed a second time the salts and minerals have condenses to a point where it is no longer useful for hydration.\nUsing plant stems that are fleshy, chewing and spitting out, grass roots and collecting moisture from dew are all useful.  WATER is what you need when you are dehydrated and should be your only consideration when you have none.  Lastly, the person giving the blood would be weakened and increase the survival burden on the person drinking it.  In survival you NEVER purposefully weaken any member of the team or the entire team suffers.",

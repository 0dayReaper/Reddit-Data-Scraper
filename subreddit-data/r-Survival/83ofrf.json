I began reading different manuals about survival/bushcraft and practicing the skills I learned on my camping trips. Years later I was able to attend some survival training courses and learn even more. \n\nShows like Survivorman, Man Vs Wild, Alone, Etc might not be able to teach a person enough for them to survive in a dangerous situation but it might be enough to inspire them to learn to do so. It sure did for me. ",

It\u2019s almost impossible for someone to pack everything they\u2019d need for summiting, that\u2019s where Sherpas come in. He still carried at least a 40lb pack, climbing 12 hours during the day and night as well. You don\u2019t just climb up to the summit, you go between camps multiple times. You climb the distance of Everest about 4 times over while trying to summit once.\n\nAt the higher altitudes you feel like shit, every step is an effort, you feel nausea, headaches, can lose control of your muscles, hallucinate.\nSpending 2-4 months on a mountain like Everest isn\u2019t easy either, stuck in a tent for weeks on end waiting out storms while you\u2019re exhausted, feeling like death. \n\n 4 people died while he was on his expedition so that\u2019s in the back of your mind. It\u2019s a mental and physical challenge.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s out there or not, but it\u2019s also possible he didn\u2019t have full service from Sherpas, if he joined an expedition they could have done everything themselves. Assuming he did enlist the help of Sherpas, most of the time they just assist with small aspects of the climb. Even if his parents did pay the 60-70k for the full Sherpa service all they do is guide you, deliver your oxygen, food, set up camp before you arrive, and cook for you. Even with all that its very difficult. Climbing Everest is still more difficult and more of an achievement than anything 90% of people will experience. I don\u2019t know where the idea that you just pay a lot of money and have a leisurely stroll up one of the deadliest places on earth came from",

They watch it to see people jumping off of high shit, drinking piss and sleeping in deer carcasses. The show wasn't made with survivalists in mind, it was made with money in mind and it worked.",

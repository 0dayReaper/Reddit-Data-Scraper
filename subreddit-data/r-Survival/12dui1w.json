    "postText": "I was inspired to post this because of the post about the \"head strap bags\" in The Revenant. There is something called a \"[Travois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travois)\" that has been used for ages, and is essentially a sled. It can made at any size so it can be used by people, or by horses, or even by dogs. At its simplest, it is just two long poles lashed together in a triangle. With a knife/hatchet and some cordage it can be thrown together in 20 minutes or less. And thanks to the resulting mechanical advantage (leverage) it can reduce a 200lb load by nearly 75% depending on the length of the poles used and where the weight is distributed along the length of the poles. So in an emergency situation, where someone is injured or incapacitated, it can make it possible for a single person to transport them across large distances. For any situation where something heavy needs moving, like transporting wood for fire, or large stones to spell out SOS on a hillside, or even just to take the weight of your pack off your back for a spell, this is a quick and effective method you can use.",

I mean dirty habits for one) cuz they insisted on using wheels and they needed to be repaired (so they would lose time risking exposure and such running out of food) and got stuck in the mud and broke on the rocks... Yeah they weren't the brightest.",

Instead of hunting, fishing, gathering, and traveling in a large group where everyone knew how to contribute and \u201cpay\u201d for passage with gifts to local chieftains, they would lug an entire kitchen around with a bunch of old people that didn\u2019t know how to do jack shit to survive and three thousand pounds of fat, flour, pickled foods, and other impractical travel items that just painted a huge target on them for the natives whose lands and way of life were being threatened by foreign invaders that viewed them as an unnecessary nuisance\u2026 in their own sacred homeland. Like getting kicked out of your own backyard, and then the front yard and eventually the house too. The natives HAD wheels for very long time\u2014 like 10,000-5,000 years ago during the old copper culture era, but as big cities disappeared and the pastoral village strategies took off, wheels were abandoned as being too complicated to make and repair without widespread access to metallurgy. On top of this, religion had changed and with it changed their perspective, causing wheels to became obsolete in their Animist lifestyles. You are very correct though about the religious implications of the wheel to Native Americans, and they very much understood that wheels roll as well (duh)\u2014 it\u2019s just that they believed they had culturally evolved beyond a need for wheels, as everything not big enough to carry short-distances was used locally. Their religions had evolved to view big cities as a place where disease (the Spanish landing brought flu and deadly colds all the way from South America up to Canada due to the sophistication of their trade routes, decimating the last of the later-age large Indigenous settlements) and disagreement were rife, and the accompanying technologies needed to run large cities were abandoned. As such, they viewed things the Europeans thought were \u201ccivilizing influences\u201d as *hokum* and unnatural. Think about it- aren\u2019t cellphones great? You can make calls on them in an emergency\u2026 but aren\u2019t they also one of the worst things to ever happen to us??? All this crap we \u201cvalue\u201d has basically sealed our doom. They had a good thing going \ud83d\ude14",

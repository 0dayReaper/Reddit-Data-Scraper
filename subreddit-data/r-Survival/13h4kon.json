    "postText": "I was fishing a wooded lake today when I heard a large animal approaching me. I yelled a few times and each time it moved and then crept closer. Its footsteps were heavy but careful. It sounded so close that if it was a deer or large varmint (something that doesn\u2019t stalk) I would\u2019ve seen it in the brush.\n\nThe internet says cougars move silently and the only sounds I can find are their screams. \n\nSo CAN you hear a cougar following you in the brush, and what does it sound like? Given the location (cougar sightings are not uncommon), size, and proximity I can\u2019t think of anything else it could have been besides a fox, but from my experience the yelling would\u2019ve driven a fox away instead of drawing it closer.",

I felt like something was stalking us, very strong, but didn't necessarily hear or see anything, then eventually I heard some rocks fall and caught a glimpse of it bounding from behind one tree to another. Then when we turned and faced it, about 75 yards, it ran at us and we had to throw rocks at it and yell. Came within 10 yards growling and snarling, pretty scary. Must have been hungry.\n\nEdited for spelling",

If I hadn't picked up on that sixth sense thing, I would never have noticed the rocks slide down the hill and seen the cat, maybe it would have been able to actually come upon us, who knows, but I will reiterate that the gut feelings are usually helpful and acting big around a cougar and fighting back is effective.",

Deer can \"thud,\" but usually they are very quiet. \n\nSame with cats, bobcats, mountain lions (cougars, panthers, same thing) you usually hear NOTHING. If you heard something but it sounded \"stalking?\" If you think it was as big as a \"large varmint?\" That is smaller than a big cat. Foxes are way smaller than a mountain lion. \n\nBobcats are the same way...smaller and silent. The fact you heard \"steps?\" I'm not even sure.",

A healthy adult cougar will likely be silent until it's on your back, but a healthy adult will also not generally want to risk injury ambushing an adult human. An injured, sick, or starving adult is the more common attacker and they are less stealthy and thus more likely to be heard or seen before they make their move. A juvenile may also not know better and may be less experienced at hunting and thus less stealthy.\n\nMy money would be on a curious adult or juvenile watching you but not necessarily planning to hunt you, so it didn't make much effort to conceal itself.",

They assume if they make a noise they won't be able to eat you, which means they'd rather just not move at all than move if doing so would make a noise. Eventually you'll move too far away to hear, then they can follow from a distance until they can get to you silently.",

Weight on back foot, step forward with front foot, feel for obstructions, retract, or offset accordingly, slowly transfer weight from back to front once determined clean, and repeat. It\u2019s slow! \n\nNow consider a cat with fur boots and at least twice the number of step and weight distribution options. Fur boots and exposed toes allow weight to be supported over sticks. \n\nYou won\u2019t hear a car unless it wants you to hear it. Even then it\u2019s probably not going to be perceptible. Also, it will always come from the downwind side. Like wind at your back blowing the direction you\u2019re looking. It\u2019s trying to smell what you are. \n\nThe pattern of the steps help determine what it is too. From your description you probably heard a deer (relatively heavy hard feet, but fairly careful where they step), or a bear/hog (just doesn\u2019t usually care)\u2026\n\nHowever, it could have been something even more scary, unpredictable, and violent: another human that didn\u2019t want you to know he was there too! \n\nGood luck, stay safe!",

We assume animals break branches because we do all the time, but we (usually) want to make noise in the woods.\n\nWhen humans don't want to make noise in the woods, we pick a sheltered spot and stay there which is why hunters use blinds. Or, we walk very, very slowly.\n\nI've startled deer before and they're virtually silent (to me) (partly because of the distance between us). \n\nYou heard a large animal that was curious, not afraid of humans, and probably didn't want to eat you. It could have been a cougar or bear for sure.",

About the only thing we heard was the occasional twig snap, or the sound of something pushing through brush. It stalked us for \\~3 miles of trail then circled out camp all night too. We caught a couple glimpses of it moving while we were hiking too, a flurry of movement on a ridge, eyes that look away from a flashlight, that sort of thing.\n\nBecause we ended up having to camp in the canyon and couldn't have a fire (too much brush), we piled brush up to make a 6ft wall around the spot we slept. Figuring that while it wouldn't stop the cat, we'd hear it come through.\n\nIn the morning there were 6 inch cat prints all around the camp site, and while hiking out there were more cat prints on top of our boot prints from the hike in, aka if followed us in.",

Though you can't explain what *\"IT\"* is, there is *\"Something\"* off, something you will experience. It starts with this awkward, unatrual silence, and this unnatural feeling of dread. You can't explain it, but something in your biology is warning you. Each time I've been stalked, each time people I know have had an encounter with a ravenous cat or bear, they've experienced something that was off, something similar. So though their infinitely more capable than you or I, with the entirety of their survival predicated on stalking, if you pay attention; though it's virtually impossible to know, you will know. It'll start with an eerie silence, a lack of birds, or wildlife making noises, etc.\n\nThere are ways to mitigate interactions, and you can start by always walking down wind. Every hunter knows how to do this. Keep your head in a swivel, pay attention to wildlife, etc. Keep in mind a cougar is the size of a med/large dog. You should be infinitely more scared of encountering a bear. You will generally hear a bear far off, and the best thing you can do while in the woods, to midigate an experience, js to be loud af, and not stumble onto, or frighten a bear shitting on the woods. \n\n*\"What do you know bruh?!\"*\n\nNot a whole lot, but I was a SERE instructor in my youth; taught good guys how to kill bad guys in the dark, and how to get away on the woods/jungle.",

It then silently jumped from the tree and landed without hardly making any sound on the rocky dirt and disappeared into the blackness without even a rustle of the sage.

DANG I thought, passed a bedded deer and didn't see it...  slowly turned my head around the trunk, looking at deer height when this cat stepped out of the brush 10' away into the trail, looks past me downhill, looks away from me uphill then does a quick doubletake back right at me.

However it revealed itself to me along a road while I was walking back from a deer blind at dusk. He followed me for a good mile or so bobbing in and out of the tree line. It made zero sound, and I mean zero, and seemed to just be curious. I only saw it because I keep my head on a swivel when hunting alone and that area was known for rabid dog attacks on hunters. The fact that it let me see him told me in that moment that I was not a snack, but a curiosity. So I wasn\u2019t really scared, but I did pick up my walking pace and keep my head on a swivel. After that mile, I never saw it again. It was like a ghost. (Side note, it was an honor to see one. As these animals are EXTREMELY endangered in the Florida wilderness and 95% of hunters in the state go their whole lives without seeing one)\n\nrabid dogs sounds the closest to me for your scenario. Having been stalked by packs of dogs, they do the running around and stomping you mentioned. They aren\u2019t careful. They smell you and whip through the woods and play with each other while looking for you. 9/10 they won\u2019t do nothing to you, just spooky hearing them around you in the woods, especially alone. They tend to keep a reasonable distance from you and WILL NOT run away after you verbally call out to them in some cases. these where once dogs that where raised in human house holds so they are familiar with the human voice.  \n\nA turkey is another possibility as they make a stomping sound despite their size. I doubt one was stalking you, but there\u2019s a high chance it was trying to get to the water source you where at but wasn\u2019t interested in finding a way around you. \n\nA deer is also likely despite what you described. while the rut isn\u2019t going on here this time of year, old bucks can experience hearing loss with very old age. On top of that some become senile and pissy. An old buck may have been trying to get to that water source and due to hearing loss and loss of vision accuracy, they make extra noise in the wood (experienced this first hand). It may have perceived you as another buck from a distance due to your scent, sound, or visual and became territorial, hence its stomping and romping around. \n\nAll in all, I can tell you if it was a big cat and made that kind of noise, you where not on the menu I can guarantee you that unless the mug was starving and on deaths doorstep. It was most likely one of the animals described above.",

When they\u2019re out and about they are notoriously quiet, or they remain still when in an advantageous position. If it was that close it may have risked making noise if it was unavoidable to get a kill, but chances are that what you heard could have been a smaller animal sounding bigger because of the surface it was walking on.",

Fuckin huge cat dude. \n\nAs I was walking I was talking out loud like you were to hopefully scare it off . I did hear it, but I don\u2019t think it was going to try anything. It was definitely something I\u2019ve never heard before. It wasn\u2019t a screaming sound like people say, I\u2019ve never head that sound.\n\nIf this was the cat it did break a stick or something, but it was quiet; made me second guess myself.\n If we didn\u2019t have the camera and I didn\u2019t see the prints I would have just written it off as a non threatening animal, but at that point I was kinda shittin my pants. \n\nI pulled out my side arm to try to defend myself if it did try anything lmao(like I would have had time to react \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f who knows). \nIt was scary as hell because I was further down in elevation than where I heard it, and then it was just quiet. I knew it was on top of me whatever it was. I don\u2019t think it could have made it silently to me before I got inside the box because I was pretty close to my safe spot haha, but who fucking knows. I was just imagining this huge cat jumping down from the sky on top of me; fuckin aerial attack \ud83d\ude02.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you though that was the scariest 3-5 min walk of my life. \n\nEnded up seeing a little bobcat later on on the opposite side of the valley( I was in a box that was overlooking the valley with mountains behind me). So idk if it was the Bob cat I heard during the walk, but whatever left those paw prints was no little bobcat. \n\nBe safe man.",

I spend a lot of time in the woods so statistically speaking I have a good chance. I'm also the type of guy that sees everything. I pick animals out of the landscape and point them out to people. What my dad calls the \"hunters eye\". Still, no cats. It's frustrating because I want to see them and I know they have been on my property. I'm a larger guy so my guess is they don't see me a food. Some of the big ones that eat mule deer might, but probably not many.",

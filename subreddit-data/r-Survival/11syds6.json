    "postText": "I recently came across a recipe for pemmican and I have been looking for similar foods since. Pemmican is high in calories and nutrition, takes minimal preparation, and can last for quite a long time without refrigeration. Parched corn and hardtack are also similar low prep high calorie foods, albeit carbohydrates mainly. Pemmican and parched corn are also from indigenous Americans. \n\nDoes anyone know of similar (low prep, indigenous, traditional, high calorie) foods that are not preserved using modern methods? Freezing, canning, and the like are great but take either significant preparation, advanced tools, or continuous energy. I'm interested in foods that I could make with a fire or stove and not need to reheat them either. \n\nI have not tried making pemmican yet, but I'm surprised I had never heard of it before, and that it hasn't been modernized. I see potential to include herbs and spices that are left out of all the recipes I see online.",

It was sort of their version of hard tack - it'll keep you going but you wouldn't want to make a steady diet of it.\n\nEssentially any dried / smoked meat is a very good source of protein but are typically lacking in fat.  The Dene in northern Manitoba smoke a lot of caribou during the winter, and will eat it with either caribou fat or sometimes margarine.  Smoked fish, particularly some of the oilier fish, will provide good fat content, but the fat is more prone to spoiling.",

For example, I think most people could figure out how to make a bow and arrow, spears, traps, or cooking pit with effort and their surrounding materials with environment permitting. But it would not be worth while to try to figure out how to can food, freeze, or vacuum seal food. That would require extensive technical knowledge and/or advanced parts. \n\nTake the dehydrator for example. It would be too technical to try to make a dehydrator, but not too technical to sun dry foods or build a wooden log smoker. But is that all there is to drying? Maybe a way to enhance the suns beams for quicker or more thorough drying? A way to dry them in wind-blown trees without animals eating them?\n\nEdit: by freezing food, I mean in an not frozen environment",

[a quick search says otherwise](https://www.google.com/search?q=do+green+foods+have+high+nutritional+value): \n\n&gt;Leafy green vegetables such as kale, spinach, Swiss chard, and bok choy are high in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Adding a variety of greens to your diet may help boost brain health and lower your risk of heart disease, cancer, and high blood pressure. Leafy green vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet.\n\nand [another](https://www.naturemade.com/blogs/health-articles/best-green-foods): \n\n&gt;Loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals (plant based compounds), green foods are typically low in calories. This means you can eat them in abundance without worrying about packing on the pounds.\r  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Wondering what green food health benefits you may reap? Jam-packed with vitamins, minerals, and healthy phytochemicals, dark green leafy vegetables top out at only 10 to 25 calories per half-cup serving. 5 Common nutrients in healthy greens include Vitamin A (as Beta Carotene) which helps support healthy vision, Vitamin C which supports a healthy immune system, Vitamin K, antioxidants, calcium, fiber, folate, iron, magnesium, and potassium. Thanks to the high content of antioxidants in these dark green vegetables, they help to neutralize free radicals to support health.\n\nYou need to educate yourself about foods, because you're honestly talking nonsense.",

It is so dry it can't rot and last a really long time. Pilots in Alaska are required to have food in the planes in case they go down, and pilot bread is popular because you don't have to replace it often. Old-fashioned hard tack was baked reported times to remove more moisture each time, then some accounts have soldiers soaking ng it to be able to eat it lol. It kept a lot of people alive though. It was an interesting read, I think Pilot boy crackers are only made in Alaska, I got some online. The similar crackers they use on the east coast to go with clam chowder aren't as dry, and don't last near as long- not a substitute.\nEdit: I stand corrected, they are made in VA. I previously read they weren't readily available outside Alaska, that was years ago and I didn't find much about them at the time. I did find lots of east coast similar crackers for clam chowder at the time and they had short expiration dates.",

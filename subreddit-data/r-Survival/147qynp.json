Considering I was born and raised in the US territory of Guam \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddfa where I still live to this day (40 yrs now), I've actually had to prep my entire life. We have been consistently hit by devastating typhoons and supertyphoons. The recent supertyphoon mawar that hit on may 23rd although completely devastating is something that a lot of us were prepared for. My gas and diesel stores are still at 75%, Food can go for another month, water is not an issue, generator runs as like a swiss watch, majority of the island builds concrete houses so we aren't left homeless. Most states have the luxury of evacuation  when it comes to impending natural disasters while we are able to pretty much shelter in place and ride out a category 5 supertyphoon. So, while the island doesn't project to be restored to 100% on the power and water grids until the end of June, most of us will be fine until the government is able to get their act together. It's an inconvenience, but as stated earlier, I've prepped for this. \u270c\ufe0f, \u2764\ufe0f, \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddfa.  Peace, love, and hafa adai from Guam, where America's day begins.",

Many of the subs are closing indefinitely, or will be reevaluating after the initial two days. \n\nThe mods are doing this on behalf of all the third party app users. The mod tools are just one example that has been used to show how this is a bad idea. Regardless, even if it was only for the mods, they're the ones that literally run every sub. Ignoring for a second that creating a sub makes you a mod, (thus the subs themselves wouldn't exist otherwise), the mods are the ones that keep spam bots, bigots, etc. from overrunning the subs, for free and virtually zero recognition (other than to be bitched at).\n\nIn addition, when concerns were raised about the API issue, Reddit's \"response\" was abhorrent, making false accusations at the Apollo Dev (with implications for others), and basically making the assumption that every Redditor is an absolute idiot that can't see through the fact that this is all in preparation for an IPO.\n\nTheir behavior is anti-user, anti-consumer, and goes against the open software and open information ideologies on which Reddit was founded.",

Even if  users and communities feel negative about the changes, if they don't find a way to be profitable, reddit would cease entirely.  So what's better, a different version of reddit or no reddit at all?  If one decides no reddit at all, then bye. Go somewhere else. I prefer reddit and can adapt to the changes if it means we can still use reddit.  That's just my opinion and I'm sure I'll get down voted and declared a bootlicker, but there is a business side to this that can't be ignored.",

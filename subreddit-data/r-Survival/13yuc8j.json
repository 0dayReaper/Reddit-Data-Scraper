Whatever you get, also get the [Magpul X-22 Backpacker Optic Mount](https://magpul.com/hunter-x-22-backpacker-optic-mount.html?mp_global_color=118). Mounting on the barrel half means it'll hold zero - no issues caused by the take-down aspect of the firearm.\n\nDepending on the iron sights that are already on your gun, you may have to spend about 5 minutes to hand-file a small notch in the optic mount so it fits. And you can still use the iron sights with the mount installed, in case the red dot fails for whatever reason. (just keep an allen key in the stock to pop off the red dot, in that case).

I took an emery board and smoothed a lot of the edges and surfaces which really seemed to help. What I don't love is how thick the stock is which is necessary to house all of the parts inside, but it certainly serves a purpose. The most annoying part is how difficult it is to get the butt of the stock off which is how you open it up to assemble it. \n\nETA: I bought this 15 years ago. I cannot say what the current editions are like.\n\nETA2: I didn't mean to come off like a hater of the gun. I was just giving my personal experience with it. I do think it is a good gun for OP.",

I will say I probably only ever used one brand of ammo that I couldn't even say what brand it was now (it has been a few years since I've shot it) so that could have been part of my problem. That being said, I was not as happy as I would have liked with the internal parts. It seemed like they were cut and never \"sanded\" so all of the edges were pretty rough which caused enough hang-ups from burrs to give me some trouble at times. I also had to file down the stock just a little because when tightened down properly I couldn't engage/disengage the safety.\n\nAlso, I still think it is the right gun for OP.",

That being said, I sight in all my 22s at 25m and will say both rifles group well with the TIkka being a bit better, anecdotally. I love my T1X but I'm always surprised just how well my 10/22 TD performs because it's nearly stock with a more basic 7 power scope in a lightweight stock. My Tikka is in a high end chassis with a better optic and bipod and is only *slightly* better.

It's not a bolt gun (it's a single shot break action) but it weighs nothing, the trigger is great, it's surprisingly accurate, and the barrel is threaded.

That way I can stuff each piece down the sides of a pack and still have tons of room. I wrapped the stock in 550 cord for emergency situations. The sights are alright, I put a trijicon rmr on mine (which costs 3x as much as the gun \ud83e\udd23) and can consistently hit a beer can at 80 yards. \nMine is chambered in 17 hmr but they make a .22 long rifle version.",

The follow up shot is relatively slow and noisy , emphasizing the need for stealth, stalking and shot placement. The survivalist sees himself as a bobcat, not a tiger. Bobcats last a lot longer in adverse situation than do tigers. There is an extension of this argument that suggest the survivalist  be armed with a knife, not a firearm: cockroaches outlast both bobcats and tigers.",

I'm not a hunter, but it's my understanding that you can't even take down a raccoon with a 22LR.\n\nETA based on the negative number, I'm sorry my legit question didn't appeal to people for whatever reason. This was not snark, this was an actual question.",

Don't just shoot them anywhere, shoot them somewhere that matters. Shoot them several times if needed.  Some would disagree with it being ok needing multiple shots sometimes, but the same would be true if you used a bigger caliber and had bad shot placement.",

And regardless of which one I use they are retrievable and reusable. That would be my personal preference over a 22. The hole is going to be the same.  Actually, now that I think about it, the bolts would be bigger than the hole made with a 22.  As for personal security, I would still stick with my 9 mm, but those are my preferences.",

Ammo is plentiful, a handful in the pocket goes a long way and doesn\u2019t burden you down The guns are light, fairly quiet and can cleanly take a significant amount of game, even sizable game, especially with well placed shots. If truly stranded and you happen across a lone hunting cabin, shack or shed there\u2019s a fair bet there\u2019s a box laying around in there somewhere. Sure it\u2019s underpowered for defense against predatory animals like bear but it will dispatch a coyote with minimal effort and well if humans are your problem, any gun in the hand is better than nothing. For an added bonus look for older tube fed models that will also shoot 22 short. Extremely quiet round perfect for rabbits and squirrels and the tubes usually hold about 18 LR and about 20 shorts.",

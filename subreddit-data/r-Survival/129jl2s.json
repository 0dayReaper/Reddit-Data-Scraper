When you are in contact with the ground you will lose heat directly through conduction -  in a hammock the conduction is much less because air is less dense than the ground. You then need to avoid convection, which is much less if you insulate properly. The problem sounds like you not using an under quilt, or if you did then you had it too tight so it was compressed under you and not trapping enough air.",

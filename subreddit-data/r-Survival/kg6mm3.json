That was almost 30 years ago and we still hang out and adventure in the outdoors. Our latest adventure was a successful CO mule deer hunt.\n\nMy family of 5 also tent camps in the winter. I have had babies in a tent down to about 12 degrees. We were in Yellowstone a few years ago for a week with the low at 2 degrees. Death Valley a few weeks ago in the teens. I am proud of my kids (a girl and two boys 10, 12, and 13) and wife. They have learned to be comfortable and have fun in the backcountry regardless of the weather. \n\nYour camp is awesome. I have never built a structure like that. I sleep out or use a tent when needed.",

                            "comment": "There are a couple options. I know some who use the Mr Heater buddy line of propane heaters. Personally I am not a fan of a device like this burning in a tent all night with me. \n\nHot tents are interesting and I may get one some day.  Canvas wall tents work well, but can be quite heavy. I am interested in the offerings by Seek Outside and other manufacturers. \n\nMy strategy has been to use a large (6 person) high quality family tent.  We used to run a 6 person REI Basecamp but upgraded to Big Agnes last year.  We used the Flying Diamond 6 (3 season +) for a year but had a door zipper fail. BA worked with us and I just received a Mad Season 8 (full 4 season). Both of the tents are standing height and had mesh vents that aren\u2019t closable. These features do cause the tent to not be much warmer than the outside temp. I would estimate we are 5-10 degrees warmer than the outside air temp, less if there is wind.  I do look forward to trying out the Mad Season 8 which has closable vents. A smaller low volume four season tent would certainly be warmer. When using my MSR Remote 3 four season with only my wife, it feels significantly warmer due to tent material, full two layers, fully closed vents, snow flaps, and most importantly lower interior volume. \n\nSleeping bag quality is what really makes the difference here. I would invest in good quality bags first and the tent second. We are big fans of down bags that are typically 600-800 fill power. I live in the west and don\u2019t have to deal with a wet humid climate often, which supports down. That said we are whitewater rafters and my down bags are on river a lot. I do like the new dry down technologies. We use our bags year round, and most are rated for zero or twenty degrees. We have two -20 bags, two +40 bags and eight bags in the zero to +20 range, most are mummy bags. (We are a family of 5) We picked up some fantastic and economical Kelty rectangular down bags about 12 years ago. They will zip together and create a double down bag that my wife and I love. Our sleeping style is very close and intertwined which the double bag supports, but it also helps keep my wife warm. We use the +40 on the bottom (because it compresses and isn\u2019t key to warmth) and the +20 on top.  We will add a Rumple comforter when needed, typically under 30 degrees. Our primary method for infants and toddlers was for them to co sleep with us in the double bag. Dress the babies warmly, but be sure they are comfortable and nothing is tight, poor circulation = cold. (Just like too many socks in boots). We used some nice big fleece sleep sacks for the babies. We use a similar strategy (sleeping in socks and long johns) for the bigger kids (6-8 yrs and up) but they are sleeping on their own.  They use bag liners to keep down bag laundry and down bag life manageable.  If it is under 30 degrees, I have a second bag available for them if needed. The two -20 bags are along but rarely used - held in reserve for emergency.  I like the two bag strategy as it allows summer gear to be used in the winter. A -20 or -40 bag doesn\u2019t have much use outside of winter. We have a couple for backcountry hunting and winter backpacking.  I taught my kids how mummy bags worked around the 6-8 yr mark and they can use them and they certainly make a difference keeping warm. Be prepared for kids new to mummy bags to wake up freaked out the first few times they cinch the bag down as they may be scared and disoriented when they wake up. Setting expectations is important here. Maybe have the mummy newbie adjacent to you in the tent for support.  With kids, the emergency bags are important in case someone has an accident, we have experienced 2-3 instances of bed wetting and a couple incidents of vomiting over the last 14 years. Having fresh bags to deploy in the middle of the night is really nice.  Closed cell foam pads (z rest) are critical for winter / snow camping.  You can run an inflatable on top of a closed cell foam, if cold flip the closed cell adjacent to you. Inflatable aren\u2019t really needed on snow, but are nice on uneven ice / rocks.  I am a fan of the Big Agnes Q core deluxe inflatable pads and their double wide sleeping bags - Sentinel is the one we have. It does need the Rumple comforter under 30 as well.\n\nI think a lot of the same applies to dogs. Depending on breed, different approaches are needed. Our 75# Chesapeake sleeps in his crate in the outer fly. I use closed cell foam under his crate and blankets / bedding in the crate. He is tough as nails and is good to zero like this. He is also a bit wild and hasn\u2019t earned inner tent privileges. The smaller the dog and lighter the coat, the more protection they need. Our smaller dogs sleep with the kids, either in the bag liner or outside the down bags as the dog needs to regulate their temp / comfort level.  Let the dog know where they are allowed and let them pick where they are comfortable. \n\nI recommend NOAA point forecasts to get a sense of the low you may experience in the specific area / elevation that you will be. I always plan for twenty degrees below the lowest forecasted low temp. I regularly see actual low temps significantly lower than the forecasted low temp. \n\nLet me know if you have questions, clarifications or suggestions for me. I am always learning too.\n\nEdit - grammar, spelling, add dog and weather section.",

To prevent them from freezing and exploding you'd think you want to keep them close to your body, but then you risk cracking them. A good trick that I've learned is to store them in my prison wallet and just lay them when needed, the way god intended.",

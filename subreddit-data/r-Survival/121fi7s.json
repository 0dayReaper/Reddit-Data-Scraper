    "postText": "We have several retrieval expeditions coming up for Southern Arizona and just over the state border in NM for Mid April. \n\nWhat kind of conditions can you expected around this time of the year? What about the vegetation any special clothing needed?  Anything else to be aware off? \n\nOn a side note this expedition was sprung on us really last minute and we still have an opening for anyone interested as most of our teams are already planned in for jungle survival courses and expeditions in South America. Send me a DM. \n\nMore opportunities following that (for this year) with retrieval expeditions in Alaska, West and East Africa coming up (which are locations we normally work in plus South America). \n\nCheers and thanks for the advice.",

As for vegetation, it's always a good idea to wear clothing that provides protection from any potential hazards like thorns or poison ivy. \n\nIn terms of other things to be aware of, I would recommend bringing plenty of water and staying aware of any potential wildlife in the area. It's always better to be safe than sorry! \n\nThanks for letting us know about the opportunity to join the retrieval expeditions. It sounds like an exciting adventure! Good luck with everything and keep us updated on your travels.",

Rattlers will be out, so good eyes/ears, a long walking stick and if you pack, snake shot for it. We just picked up 2 more 10 packs for our .45acp's today. WATER, WATER, WATER. We each have the largest Camelbacks and that lasts me for 1 day. Broad brimmed hat. Bandana. Lightweight gloves come in handy. BOOTS. We both wear military surplus, rugged, with lightweight wool socks. Always a compass. Small first aid kit.",

Two different deserts. \n\nCochise is typical basin and range, river valleys 4k, ranges up to 9.5k.  Eastern pima county is similar, except it gets lower. Tucson is 2.5k. Then lower into the desert west of the tucson mountains.\n\nWhere ya headed specifically and i can better answer or recommend specific maps. \nHuachucas, mules, dragoons, chirucahuas, mt Lemmon, mt wrightson - all sky islands. \n\nCreeks or drainages in the mountains still have some flow from snow run off. But that'll slow into April may.   San Pedro river gets a little stagnant. Or pools. But I wouldn't call it ephemeral. \n\nSan Rafael Valley nice grasslands. Sulphur spring valley experiencing subsidence from wells. Not much surface water. \n\nLet me know!",

Don't expect water to be available but do be wary for flash floods. It's been a particularly wet winter. \n\nRip stop pants, long sleeves, and avoid mesh footwear due to sand, thorns and snakes. It's early snake season and they'll be cranky. If you've got gaiters I'd take them. Also I'd have a pair of forceps clipped to a handy spot on your bag or chest harness for cholla or other pricklies. Remember, don't flick them off or you'll have a VERY bad day. Good luck!",

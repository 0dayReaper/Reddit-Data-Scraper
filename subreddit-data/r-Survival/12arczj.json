    "postText": "Greetings to all! I am currently writing to you from Panama. Yesterday we had a protest down here where the citizens of a community blocked a major road for about 10 hours. My friend was stuck for about 5 of those hours with no food and had not ate since its a bit of a short drive from where she was coming from. That being said, I was thinking about putting to getting a survival kit together that can be left in a car but my concern is the extreme heat that we experience down here. Any thoughts, ideas or suggestions that this community can provide would be highly appreciated. Thank you!",

DI water can go in your radiator and a lot of places, but doesn't really help if you're dying of heat. Add a touch of electrolytes, and it's ready to drink for humans.",

                    "comment": "Actually, that is a bit of a misconception. . .a human body can tolerate a certain imbalance of electrolytes through a number of mechanisms, whereas it cannot tolerate insufficient H2O intake.   It kind of reflects back on that old argument that you can not drink deionized or Reverse Osmosis water as it has no electrolytes.  Neither are true.\n\nWhen you drink distilled water, or Reverse Osmosis derived water, it will dilute your electrolytes, especially Sodium, but your body can usually tolerate an imbalance, and pull sodium from body tissues, and if there is anything in your gut, that as well.\n\nThere is a point, where if your Sodium gets too low, you will start showing symptomology, but dehydration will cause worse symptoms much faster and worse than low Sodium.  But then, they still sell salt pills, which in a desert environment are a good thing to have a few of anyway.  \n\n\nI will let you in on another little secret, carry some pickle juice with you. . it is very high in sodium and believe it or not, it will stop a leg cramp in about a minute and a half, much quicker than anything else.  Scientists are still not sure why it works with cramps, but feel it has more to do with the Acetic acid (vinegar) in the juice, acting on a receptor in the back of the throat as apposed to the salt.    \n\n\nSee: [https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/can-pickle-juice-reduce-cirrhotic-muscle-cramping](https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/can-pickle-juice-reduce-cirrhotic-muscle-cramping)\n\nand:\n\n[https://www.healthline.com/health/pickle-juice-for-cramps](https://www.healthline.com/health/pickle-juice-for-cramps)",

The only one that would filter out ions and minerals would be a ***reverse osmosis filter***.  This has to do with the porosity of the filter medium, AND the way reverse osmosis works. (*under pressure, where in the water molecule can fit through the membrane under pressure, but ions of things like Sodium and Chloride cannot.*)\n\n  \nThe lifestraw, can filter down to 0.2 microns which is generally small enough to remove bacteria, parasites, dirt, silt etc, but not ions like Sodium or Chloride.  Apparently they also offer a micro filter that removes particles down to 0.002:  \n\n\n\"*LifeStraw also manufactures ultrafilters/purifiers that, in addition to the above contaminants, also remove viruses. The absolute pore size on these purifiers is 0.02 micron.*\"  \n\nSource: [https://help.lifestraw.com/article/97-how-does-lifestraw-work](https://help.lifestraw.com/article/97-how-does-lifestraw-work)  \n\n\nHope that helps!",

As a general rule, you should always have distilled water in your vehicle. If you can, of course you should have common fluids in your car - I carry window de-icer in winter; I carry coolant concentrate and DI water all year. Now, you said \"regular tap water can go in your radiator just fine, cars don't care.\" You didn't cover your ass saying \"if your water is soft\" or \"if you're just topping up.\" What if someone who had hard water read that? What if they busted a clamp and instantly lost most of their coolant? I asked you to clarify it, and you doubled down. As a general rule, you should not put tap water in your radiator. If you lose a hose clamp, or you're significantly low on coolant, DI water will get you home with less after-effects than tap water. Tap water will always lead to problems if you use it to make coolant eventually. But just to make sure, as a GENERAL RULE - use coolant or pre-mix if you can. DI water if you have to. Tap water is for emergency use only.",

Those chemicals might be harmful if you drank them ever day for 30 years. Maybe. You're fine if you only drink it in an emergency.\n\nAlso, there are \"stabilised\" plastics don't have that issue at all. It's mostly an issue for cheap disposable plastic especially with refrigerated foods (nearly all plastic is safe at fridge temperatures).\n\nYou generally want to keep sunlight out of the water too, since sunlight means energy and bacteria.

If the optics are mounted on the stock end of the takedown, it won't be zeroed in after you take it down and reassemble it. This basically limits you to a red dot or irons.  \n\n\nMy takedown came with fiber optic orange/green sights (and the magpul backpacker stock) and I find those incredibly satisfying. I plan to get a red (or green) dot and have never shot my 10/22 with one, so I can't say if that's better than the sights, but you definitely don't want a stock-mounted scope.",

I see on their reviews some folks put these on a take down. Me personally I only have standard 10/22\u2019s and I love them. \n\nI learned about them while learning how to properly shoot with a sling and open sights at an Appleseed. If you have never heard of that or learned to shoot open sights check them out! I\u2019ve gone to three now and will go again. I also want to try their pistol course.",

I\u2019ve tried to buy them elsewhere and even tho they said cotton and the real thing some of the others were much harder to adjust. Once you get to the Appleseed and they teach you how to use the sling having an easily adjustable sling is a must have. \n\nhttps://store.rwvaappleseed.com/page13.html\n\nIf my phone gave the right link it should be the first one on the page. I believe they still sell the tech sights at the same price\u2026two birds, one stone. \n\nIf u haven\u2019t done so, consider upgrading the mag release and maybe the bolt catch. Both are cheap and big upgrades to the gun when you\u2019re doing a lot of shooting like at an Appleseed.",

Although you can get more accuracy out of them with better glass, the 10/22 just doesn\u2019t benefit quite as much as other rifles. I think the Vortec SPARC on my AR would be a nice choice for that carbine. Good, solar powered, durable, affordable, one MOA dot I think. Also, if you got the takedown model for portability, a red dot will take up less space too, and the SPARC has a low mount option included which goes nicely with the low profile sights.",

If I had to do it again I would prolly spend the extra few \ud83d\udcb5 and get their micro-prism since its a  backpacker 10-22 takedown to keep the form factor small and the weigth down.

Lastly my sleeping bag, I never brought a tent I enjoyed sleeping under the stars going to sleep with them being the last thing I saw before sleep. Was great as a canoe to a river trip twice as fun but not as alone.\nBut I had moved from just north of Boston to NB Canada lol big diff between the and where you plan to go.\nBut I would honestly rethink this idea if I were you and go do some backpacking within the area you live to get the feel of it. Trust me big difference from sleeping in your bedroom especially at night cause some can be very long nights when you have a bear or other wildlife giving you a hard time.\nBy from just comments I read you aren't ready for this trip you are planning if you still have to save up to buy your gear then you are not prepped or ready for this type of survival trip.\nJust for something to think about venomous snakes spiders bugs and other things any idea what they are their names what they look like what you need to survive a bite?? This to me is even more important than having to worry about the Islamist terrorist groups lol!!\nBut this is no joke really because your not ready. Get some experience have fun enjoy your local areas you'd be surprised at the area around you that you never really seen.\nIn the mean time do some research on areas you want to go to in the Philippines see what the dangers are and other things you need to take in to consideration.\nLastly hope you have a great trip and better return lol!!",

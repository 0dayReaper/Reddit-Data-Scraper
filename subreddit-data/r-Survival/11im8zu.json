I seek much needed wisdom on how to properly deal with them, be it camping or SHTF prepping. Much thanks\n\nEDIT: I want to thank you all for taking the time to answer my question, all your answers have been quite informative, thank you so much!",

            "comment": "As someone who grew up in in the outdoors of Louisiana and has been all over the country hiking/camping/hunting/fishing etc, if im being honest snakes are probably the last thing I actually worry about in the woods. Yes they can be deadly if they are taken for granted, but more often than not they will try to get out of your way if they know you are walking towards them. We have rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, copperheads, coral snakes, etc etc and the most aggressive of them all so far in my life has just been regular harmless water snakes. If something is too big for a snake to eat, its rarely going to waste its venom striking at it unless its pure defensive reaction. Just be careful walking around/over obstacles, wear good footwear/pants, and if possible sleep a little off the ground if youre seriously concerned about them. Just like any other animal they arent really going to try to pick a fight with something way bigger than them. If you do see one, just slowly walk around it and leave it alone. Dont reach your hand under rocks or brush piles where you cant see very well, just use a stick or something for that. Step on logs and look on the other side if you can before stepping over them. And if youre walking in shorter foliage remember to check branches at eye level, because they can climb and will sun in branches. Ive had several that i almost grabbed just trying to move branches out of the way. Dont be afraid to go camping next to your home or with friends for a while before going solo. Build up confidence at your own pace because if you get in a tight situation far from help it can turn things bad very quickly. Good luck!",

But I'm sure I've encountered them dozens of times in the wild. Sometimes *very* close (the worst one was in my house... and we had it professionally removed by someone who positively ID'd the species).\n\nThey can move faster than a human at a dead run, and they're not afraid of anything. Because everything is afraid  of them. At the same time, lots of other animals will try to kill them on sight (especially a small snake) so they're ready to fight and don't just reserve venom for food. The venom is fast acting, designed to quickly kill prey that fights back.",

                            "comment": "Much like the rattlesnake yes they are extremely deadly, even more so since they are the 2nd most venomous land snake i believe. However, if you read the article in the link you added, it does say that in a study of 455 encounters with a Eastern Brown snake, only 12 times did a snake move toward the individual. The other times they moved away or hid. Again, most animals will not attack something unless they 1)want to eat it or 2) feel its necessary to defend themselves. Moving slowly and watching your step avoids most encounters where you would threaten a snake so much it feels it has to strike at you. When im out i almost always carry a stick or something with me just as a precaution if one started coming at me, but thats never really been necessary.",

The fastest snake in the world appears to be a sidewinder, topping out at 18mph. That's a highly specialized snake moving over open sands and probably downhill reaching speeds that an athletic adult could reach. The only thing I can think is you're talking about striking speed but for some reason comparing it to running speed. It seems awfully fear monger-y while replying in a thread posted by someone who's admitted they have a phobia...in other words, it seems a bit douchey.",

I grabbed a flashlight and saw a big ass copperhead coiled around the breaker box that I almost just grabbed.

Two got into a small boat and headed directly across toward a large stump. When they got within several feet away from that stump (which was only 20 yards from the pier) a water snake bolted from under the pier and straight toward the boat. It was assumed the snake was defending a nest. Could a snake see that far? Research has shown some snakes can have limited control of improved vision.\n\n[Snake eyesight](https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/snakes-have-poor-eyesight-can-boost-their-vision-if-threatened-2d11577701)\n\nI do agree completely that snakes will avoid confrontations 99% of the time. In many reports of being chased, the snakes escape route was being blocked. It's a more common scenario with water snakes/cottonmouths. I've been around several of the latter that just didn't seem to care about passing by within inches or they seemed curious. I can see how that might be interpreted as aggressive. I've had the same behavior displayed by a mink, but the snake isn't known for being cute and fuzzy.",

The snakes need sunlight to keep warm, which means they search for clearings. And a walking trail is often the only clearing for miles in any direction. Certain times of the year (warmer months) I used to see a snake on my trail about once a day.\n\nA few times I didn't see them until too late, they're often the same color as the ground and even watching where I step I've still stepped on them. They weren't scared enough* to move out of my way on their own. The big venomous ones around here are particularly unafraid and I wonder if the ones that have done a big threat display babies or eggs to protect.\n\nSticking to the trail is still good advice, you've got a much better chance of seeing the snake, but you will see them if they're around.\n\n(* we had an Eastern Brown Snake slide straight into our house in the middle of the day once. Four adults eating at a table, a dog begging for food next to the table... and the snake went straight under the table on the way to wherever it was going... completely ignored us. Luckily we were able to stop the dog from attacking it, or she'd have died for sure. I've lost two pets that way)\n\nMy Rules:\n\n- Rule #1 wear protective clothing, especially on your lower legs.\n- Rule #2 be really careful while gathering firewood or clearing a campsite/trail - don't put your hands/arms/face where a snake might be hiding.\n- Rule #3 know what to do if you're bitten.\n- Rule #4 don't be afraid to decide it's not worth the risk. Just today, I wanted to take a nice photo and changed my mind when I realised to get to where I needed to stand I'd need to walk without boots/long pants through knee deep grass. It was raining heavy, so any snakes about would've been searching for high ground and generally in a flighty/unpredictable mood. Nope, not worth it.",

But if you do live in an area that has common venomous snakes. The best advice I can give you is, if you see one. Just give it distance. If you hear one but don't see one?  Stop. Don't move. Try to locate it. And back away from it. 99% of the time they are just as scared as you are and simply want to do exactly what you might do and turn around and run away.",

If you are in an area with venomous snakes, along with avoiding them by mostly just watching where you are stepping or placing your hands, learn how to deal if you do get bit. Treatment is a little different for different types of venom, but most of the time in North America, simple elevation, taking off rings, watches, shoes, etc., and getting to a hospital fast is appropriate. Do NOT suck venom out, cut the wound, wrap it, apply ice, or apply a tourniquet (except in very rare cases). \u201cBite kits\u201d are useless and can make the damage worse. \n\nEducation is the key here in dealing with your fear.",

So, you really only need to be extra aware of what is within three feet of you because they can only strike so far. When you're walking, look TWO steps ahead of you. Snakes like to be under things or right against things; they prefer to be well-hidden. Avoid tall grass or wear boots. Before you step off of a raised rock or stump or something, look where your feet will land when you do. If its raining, snakes like to climb trees. The more you can understand snake behavior, the safer you'll be (because you'll know where to look) and they'll feel less frightening. My dad always said, \"for every snake you've seen, 30 have seen you\" and I believe it. Water Moccasins are dicks, Rattlesnakes are primal, and Copperheads are mostly chill. If you come across a Hognosed Snake (nonvenomous), they're so entertaining! They go from \"look at me, I'm a scary, growling cobra\" to \"aww too bad; I'm dead now. See my white belly is up and my tongue is hanging out?\"",

The other instance is that snakes are not particularly smart, but they typically know what direction to go to be \u201csafe\u201d. However, many times you are in between the snake and its safe place, so it comes in your direction. The frightened human runs away from the snake, but since you are now also running towards its safe place along with the snake, it is mistaken for chasing.",

Dont ever try to become a snake expert out of a fear of snakes lol its not worth it. I love snakes. I grew up with snakes, was a junior ranger, and have handled snakes my whole life. I cant always identify every common snake properly even. \n\nSo just follow the rule of not touching them and to back away slowly. Thats really all you need to know.\n\nAnd if you ever do get bit, treat it like a venomous snake bite and go to an ER. You can get an infection even from a non venomous snake bite.\n\nPS snake venom goes into the lymphatic system as fast as it goes into the circulatory system. Its really quite impressive how well venom gets into your system. Theres been studies showing that using a tourniquette doesnt really do much to stop the spread of the venom, which is how we know this also. So, I mean, the biggest thing is to definitely DO NOT get bit. Do not mess with snakes. \n\nIf you are walking in a leafy area, it helps to shuffle your feet. \nSnakes are not hearing animals, but they feel vibrations on the ground. \nYou will likely see loads of snakes but the chances of  one attacking you is low. So just keep your eyes peeled and take a few steps back, slowly and gingerly, and change your route.",

Also have your local poison control hotline number written with sharpie on something like a keychain that you keep with you on hikes.\n\nLuckily for you, snakes are least active during the cold months. In warmer months, bring a walking stick with you and lightly sweep the ground in front of you when you\u2019re walking through dense foliage. Most snake bites are the result of someone stepping on a snake they didn\u2019t see. Snakes, especially venomous snakes, don\u2019t want to bite you if they can avoid it; making venom costs the snake a lot of bodily resources and takes time to \u201crefill\u201d, leaving it vulnerable after using its venom.

Wash the bite with soap and water, take a sharpie and mark the edge of the swelling/tender area and write the time down on the edge of the swelling. Keep the bite below your heart. The idea is to slow down your body's circulation as much as possible. At this point you want to get medical attention as soon as possible. If there's someone there with you or your friend was bitten, send the person who wasn't bitten. One thing to note, you probably won't need emergency medical help if it's a non venomous snake like a black snake or garter snake. But if you don't know the snakes in your area, then you might as well treat every snake as if the bite will kill you. \n\nDo not apply a tourniquet, ice, or any medication orally or topically. \nIt is not recommended to cut the wound open or suck the venom out. \n\nNow with that being said. If I was bit by a rattlesnake or other known venomous snake and was alone and I knew I wouldn't be able to make contact with anyone for 4 hours or more. I would make the decision to try and use something to suck the venom out. (not your mouth or your friends mouth). A bottle or even a snake bite kit, just something that can create suction. According to Red cross's 1978 snakebite treatment, they say to cut the fang marks open before suction. But I'd argue this isn't ideal.  Regardless, this is an absolute last ditch effort if you know the snake is venomous and you won't reach medical help in time. The only real way to treat a venomous snake bite is with anti-venom. Hope this helps with the first aid side of it.",

And they are trying to get warmth from the fire, or are hunting the frogs\n\nif you see a snake, the best way to deal with it in your case would be have a long forked sturdy stick. leave it alone unless it comes closer then you can pin it, from there..well i would usually just move them away from camp. If you dont know much about snakes, identifiers how to handle them etc, as much as i hate to say it..cut its head off, bury the head because it can still bite.\n\nIn case any more flakes come along, no i dont condone killing any animal you dont plan to eat reptile, amphibian, mammal or fowl  unless you see it as a threat, a perceived threat is justification enough ..you can stop sending me messages now.",

Remember, there is no such thing as an \"aggressive snake\" only defensive snakes. \n\n\nWorst case if you are envenomated, most species in the US --if you are a healthy adult without preexisting conditions,  who can reach a hospital or airlift /med evac within 3-4 hours chances are you will be fine\n\n- only rare circumstances like where a fang has hit an artery or you are bitten on the upper abdomen/face area where you can be in serious danger rather quickly. \n\nThe three most venomous/quickest to kill you snakes in the US are the Mojave rattlesnake, east and west coral snake and the eastern diamondback, the Mojave unlike other rattles have mostly neurotoxic venom so it can cause cardiac arrest quickly.\n\nThe coral snake is an elapid (cobra family) and like the Mojave has a neurotoxic venom, however, they are very docile, rare to bite and they are rear fanged and usually deliver \"dry bites\" on first strike, they literally have to kinda chew on you to deliver a lethal dose. \n\nThe eastern diamond back is the least toxic venom wise by volume of the three, however it more than makes up for it because of the amount of venom they deliver and almost never dry bite.\n\n\nAll the others in the US have mostly cyto/hemotoxic venom and rarely cause fatalities, just disfigurement, losing fingers, hands/feet if untreated for Ling amounts of time \n\n\n\n\nDon't fear snakes, respect them!",

They aren\u2019t going to be just coming after you for no reason, at least anywhere in the US, but a couple species (like water moccasins) might be territorial and bitter in any exchange. \n\nThey\u2019re active in temps above 55-60 degrees, and especially as the sun starts to heat up the morning during the spring. Be careful in thick vegetation, near old buildings (anywhere mice or rats might congregate), and near water sources in particular. If they bite, the vast majority of snakes bite at the foot/ankle area, so boots limit their potential a bit instantly. They have snake boots (or chaps) with a thick fabric up to the mid calf I use hunting (which stopped a rattlesnake from biting me once I accidentally stepped on it in the dark). \n\nI\u2019d recommend looking into a pair of snake boots if you\u2019re spending a lot of time in the woods in snake-y areas, especially if you have a phobia. Use a tent and recognize logically that a snake isn\u2019t going through a zipped fabric to come after you. Always use lights at night anytime above 55 degrees and make vibrations walking to spook them (ie don\u2019t be a feather walking). If you see one far away, just avoid it and move on. If you see one and it\u2019s nearly at you, move at a slight angle away from you backwards - going at a slight angle sideways and backwards helps the snake perceive we\u2019re moving away from it better than just going straight back.",

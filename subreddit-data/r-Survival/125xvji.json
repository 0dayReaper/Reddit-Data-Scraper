The average person who finds themselves in need of surviving in the wilderness -especially if thrust into this situation unexpectedly or with little time to prepare; is not going to have many (if any) modern-world accoutrements with them.\n\nSo, how did the North American Indians prepare their hides and furs for use? They certainly didn't have bleach, dawn dish detergent, or even copious amounts of salt!\n\nIf we are going to learn a skill -let's actually learn it.\n\nWith this in mind, let me adjure you to avail yourself of the knowledge found in this informative article:\n\n[Skinning and Tanning the Native American Way](https://skyaboveus.com/hunting-shooting/Skinning-and-Tanning-The-Native-American-Way)",

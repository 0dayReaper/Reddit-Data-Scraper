    "postText": "Hello. Quick question with a short scenario.\n\nYou're in the wild, get a nasty gash on your leg (from a blade/falling on a sharp stick etc. You get the idea). You bleeding slightly (just minor bleeding but you need to cover it at least the next day)\n\nYou have no bandages but you got plenty of clothes. And a lot of water. You rip up the clothes and have rags that are not sterile. You boil the torn rags in a water you have plenty of in your small portable pan over fire. Meanwhile you clean the wound with the rest of your water (or imagine you have a tiny bit of alcohol or other desinfectant but not enough to clean the rags).\n\nNow you got boiled sterilized rag to cover the gash and a clean wound.\n\nMy main question is : do you cover the wound with the rag eventhough its soaked since u boiled it? Its sterile but wet/soaked. Do you cover the wound with wet rag? Or do u let it dry? How? If you put it somewhere it would become unsterilised again. Do you put it somewhere in the bag you have and continue with your gash being not covered? What do you do? I always wondered this question. How can you sterilize a rag by boiling and then using it, if its wet?!\n\nAlso, how do you keep the rag sterile for future use? Does it matter if you put it in like a safe compartment in your backpack? (Which is not obviously sterile but not dirty either?)\n\n\nEdit : Thanks everyone for the extra tips and knowledge! You guys have been super helpful in this regard.",

            "comment": "Assuming this is just for infection prevention, and not to stop blood, i think being wet would make it almost useless over a few hours, because the water will give a travel path for the biological cobtaminants outside the wound, through the bandage, though, its not super important for the bandage to be sterile, it is much more important for the clenaing to be done with sterile cloth, so you could boil a cloth, let it cool for a minute, use it while wet to clean the wound deeply, like really get in there and get all the dirt out, and then just cover the wound with a clean dry cloth .\n\nAlso, perhaps you could quickly dry a boiled cloth by putting it flat onto a hot plate over the fire, or hanging it in the smoke ?",

Well lets assume we cleaned the wound deeply and visibly there is nothing stuck inside. \n\nHow do you at least store the wet rag? Do you try squeezing it? What if you want to use the rag later? Have it already prepared you know? \n\nSo covering the wound is less important than properly cleaning the wound? I see... Hmmm...\n\nWow thats rly good idea. So if I am having the wet rag right? I pour the water OUT of the pan on the ground while still having the fire, and then sort of \"cook\" it for a while until its dry? Then have absolutely sterile and dry cloth! Wow thats such a good idea lol. My answer finally solved!! Thx so much. Also won't the rag kinda... Catch on fire somehow? Assuming the fire isnt like huge its just regular cute fire.\n\nDo u think hanging it in the smoke or like above the fire would still keep it sterile while drying it? If so thats also brilliant idea. Perhaps on a thick stick so jt doesnt break. But then the rag could get a tiny bit dirty. Meybe holding it close to the fire with your own (slightly also dirty ://// ) hands would dry it out nicely. And pretty quickly. So far \"cooking\" it over in the pan is probably the best strategy.",

Peroxide, alcohol or concentrated soap is effective for killing germs , but also damages the healthy cells at the margins of the wound, which slows healing and encourages infection. On the brighter side, heavy bleeding does a dandy job of washing out contaminants, so don\u2019t irrigate if it\u2019s hemorrhaging, instead apply compression with a clean cloth, or with caution, a tourniquet. Adding a 5X7 abdominal dressing and a 6 inch ace bandage to your first aid kit greatly improves your options in dealing with a significant open injury.",

You might not get an infection, and hopefully will get to a hospital if you do. I've used a lot of paper towels, napkins and duct tape for bandages and I'm not dead, but if you have it sterile is always better of course. If you're stuck out there somewhere and need to change the dressing after the initial stoping the bleeding,  I don't think cooking a wet rag dry in a pan would hurt anything, not sure it would help either, and it wouldn't stay sterile once you handle and store it.",

Change the clean dressing daily if possible, and irrigate more gently again each time. Avoid disturbing any scabbing or healing tissue with the gentle irrigations. The main goal of the dressing in this setting is to prevent more gross contaminants (dirt, etc.) from entering the wound until you can get to a better environment. There will be bacteria entering the wound in any field setting just from your skin. In the wilderness, even moreso. The only realistic standard in the field is generally clean, not sterile.",

I thought since its your blood then it doesnt matter if it touches. Can you possibly in scenario where you have one bandage just rotate it to the side where the blood isn't present? Like turn it around and rotate it snd then rebandage the same wound with the same bandage? I think that seems like viable option.",

Yeah you want to change the dressing because the secretions from the wound, to include the blood, will rot and fester. \n\nThink about the putrefaction of soaking a cloth in blood and leaving it to sit outside; one would imagine flies laying eggs in it, other insects feeding on it, a necrotic, iron-like odor... that's what you're doing, having that against the wound for long periods of time definitely worsens the chance of infection. \n\nIf you can't change the dressing but it's soaked in rotting exudate, I'd discard it entirely. That's more contaminative than the outside world is. If your situation is that desperate, you're likely to be in a bad way by the time you evacuate.\n\nIf you can pack honey and Vaseline, you can pack a decent first aid kit. Regarding foraged honey, I don't have any expertise or training on research using it as an antiseptic, so I can't comment on that. While my line of work requires more readiness to improvise than the civilian side of things, we still largely use actual medical equipment; if we're having to MacGyver stuff out of torn rags and honey things have gone horribly, horribly wrong. We also carry potent, broad-spectrum IV/IM antibiotics that we give prophylactically to all penetrating trauma in a field environment. That's our most potent stalwart against infection, and without that, there will always be a greater element of pure hope involved.",

But thanks for the extra explanation. Good to remind me + tell others!\n\nWow thanks thats good answer! I personally wouldn't really irrigate it very often after it already got covered. Also i dont know the concept of changing the bandages often? You said every day preferably, but that hardly is the case in most scenarios. In mine you would have few rags but only one or teo would be boiled. If i had one single clean packaged bandage, snd nothing else, what would happen if i cleaned the wound and covered jt with dry clean sterile rag? Do I still need to change it? What if I dont. Is there some kind of bacteria growth because of not changing the bandage? What if the bandage looks clean enough?\n\nAlso additionally, what if I have like a clean vaseline/honey? Can I absolutely fill the found with honey/vaseline and cover it with semi-clean bandage and be good to go? And not change the bandage? Just let it heal covered by honey to prevent dirt+bandage that is relatively clean? Thanks!",

I\u2019m talking three gallons or more. All wounds and skin are very dirty. Once flushed, then by all means cover with a cloth, the cleaner the better. As our skin is completely covered with germs, it would be nice if the dressing was sterile, but not essential. A deep wound needs to heal from the inside towards the surface, so allow that. I personally keep it moist with Polysporin, or a similar product. If it\u2019s really gaping, butterfly closures help to lessen the scar surface, but don\u2019t suture or staple a dirty wound. It has a very good chance, despite all this, of needing antibiotics if it gets red hot and swollen, so if the wound is severe, head out of the bush to help. No rush, you have a couple of days probably.",

I also kind of doubt it's talking about full thickness wounds.\n\nMaybe you could do it at home or in a hotel, but I wouldn't use Neosporin on a full thickness wound in a wilderness survival situation (what this subreddit is about).",

            "comment": "Hello friend. Medical personnel here. \nThere are many variables in your scenario but it is not uncommon to use what we call \u201cwet to dry\u201d dressings on open wounds that require packing in a hospital setting. Typically a sterile gauze is loosely packed in into a wound - either with sterile saline or Dakins solution ( basically a small concentration of bleach) and then covered with a dry one. \nBoiling a cloth to cover a wound would in my honest opinion take too long and take too much fuel. You need to boil it for a while to make it truly sterile, at a rolling boil. And then as soon as you take it out assuming you don\u2019t use your bare hands on boiling hot water and you use a stick, you\u2019ve gone and made it dirty again. If you wait for that water to cool then your wound continues to bleed uncovered for even more time. \nYou also run the risk of introducing fibers into the wound. \n\nWhat I recommend in the field assuming you haven\u2019t got any medical supplies is to 1. Apply pressure to the wound as best as you can to stop the bleed. 2 when the bleeding is under control you can try to carefully approximate the edges and wrap it with the cleanest material you have available. Depending on the size of the wound, a nice blood clot and your skin will be a better bacterial barrier. If you don\u2019t have nice clean material, you can then take the time to clean and dry it as cleanly as you can given the wound bleed is under control. \nGenerally however I would discourage wet cloth on the wound as wet blood will provide a nicer substrate for bacterial growth. Keep it nice and clean and dry. Obviously if you\u2019ve experienced a metal puncture you may need vaccine for tetanus. If you\u2019ve pierced your flesh with a dirty blade that you were cleaning a squirrel with or something like that then you likely have introduced bacteria into the flesh and you may need to seek medical treatment for a proper washout. \nIf you can\u2019t seek medical attention then in this case I would allow the wound to bleed a short amount of time to allow your sterile blood to wash the wound out if that makes sense. The only other thing I can think of would be an application of topical honey to the wound to help keep it clean and honey can theoretically be found in the wild although not easily. \n\nThis is all assuming superficial venous bleeds. \nIf you\u2019ve punctured an artery I hope you have a friend with you and possible a tourniquet \n\nBottom line, travel with an ifak. It\u2019s inconvenient to travel with alcohol and wound cleanser but at least carry sterile gauze and a compression wrap. If you\u2019re generally healthy your body can fight off most small infections.",

I was beside a fresh water spring. There were clothes, a towel, a camp stove, lantern, etc, in my pack. I had a bottle of filtered water but someone else had the water filter. I had salt. I always do. First off people under season food. Second it\u2019s good for infection lol. Actually I always have salt and vinegar. But anyway. Oh and I had one of those portable bidets, along with a roll of TP, which I also always have. A sewing kit. The usual. \n\nPortable bidet for reference: \nhttps://amzn.to/3oRZ1Y2\n\nFirst of all the main worry isn\u2019t infection. It is animals and mosquitoes. Whatever you do, you want to do it fast, before anything catches the scent of your blood, and move away from the blood pool. God help you if there are small carnivorous bugs around \ud83d\ude2d or if a centipede gets in that hole. \n\nI filled the bidet bottle from the spring and added about a tsp of salt, shook it up and sprayed out the wound. This hurts like the 7th circle of hell. I also cleaned around the wound, which hurt less. \n\nI then washed my hands in the spring and let the blood itself clean the wound for a second. Basically I air dried my leg while killing every fly that so much as thought about it. \n\nI held the edges of the wound together until they stuck. Basically until a scab started to form. I pulled out a sock, chopped off the toe, and carefully pulled it up over my calf to hold things closed. I waited to see if it would soak through. When it did I folded up another sock and slipped it under my sock tube. \n\nI usually bring 8+ pairs of socks and at least 3 pashminas or scarves. I don\u2019t waste my clothes or swim suits on first aid. The last thing you want is to be nude or wearing rags in the Canadian woods. Black flies *shudder* \n\nA bleeding wound is cleaning itself, to some extent. You can put peroxide or alcohol in a massive gash or toss boiling water cloth on yourself but like\u2026why?",

I mean yeah it can disinfect i suppose but still i would rather use clean water instead and flush it out etc.\n\nHow long did it take for the edges to stick together? Must have taken ages, no?\n\nGood strat slipping in another sock. In that situation you could use vaseline or other basically \" insulating\" agent. Honey as well. I never imagined how important it would be. You could just cover the wound with it and some kind of bandage clean or semi-clean and just let it there, because the bandage wouldn't even be soaked with your own drying rotting blood, because of the honey/vaseline. Also some kind of butterfly stitches apparently (info from another commenter) holds the wound closer so the area is much smaller. Basically what u did yourself.\n\nIm glad u made it out alive and without bears stalking u LOL. Btw what caused such a gash??? I rly need to know, so i can watch out and never let that happen to me.",

                            "comment": "I dunno. Salt water has always worked for me over long term experience, salt is easy to carry and it stores dry. Any liquid can spill all over your bag and destroy everything. An unnoticed alcohol leak can set your bag on fire. And leave a trail if you\u2019ve been walking. \n\nTheories don\u2019t work like reality does sometimes.\n\nI\u2019ve never had to hold something longer than a couple minutes to get it to stick. If you coagulate less freely than me, apparently you can use liquid bandage or actual bandage. Some people use krazy glue. I don\u2019t. \n\nSo many things have cut me. That day it was a rock. We had been climbing, rapeling, and building trail toilets all week. I had been digging 4-6 foot holes, swinging trail tools, and portaging metal canoes, and I was fine. \n\nBut at the end of the week leisure hike (because apparently \u201crelaxation\u201d is more hiking) I cut myself on a stupid rock. I was tired, it was hot, and I was seething at the whole idea of rewarding people who had been hiking 8 hours a day for 7 days with a 3 hour uphill, full sun \u201cleisure hike\u201d when we came to this spring and fearless leader dumped out everyone\u2019s water bottles that had been redistributed for weight, refilling them from the spring. I only had one reserve bottle in my pack that I didn\u2019t give him. I watched a frog leap into the spring water and noticed some slimy lichen on the side of the spring and I decided it wasn\u2019t potable without a filter which nobody brought. \n\nI hiked a really long way with no breakfast, no water, no nothing. Slipped and fell on a stupid rock. Not even a GOOD rock. Just a crappy ordinary grey rock with a sharp edge. But I couldn\u2019t fall on it like a normal person \ud83d\ude02\n\nThey went on to the next check point (halfway) to have lunch and would return to my location in like 2 hours (final hour of the hike, then back to me). So my options were to sit there for 2 hours and then hike the 2 hours back with no breakfast AND no lunch or patch myself up, hike an hour, eat lunch, and then hike the 3 hours back. \n\nI had 20 minutes or less to clean and patch my leg wound. I assume in a survival situation you\u2019d have less time. \n\nI never went to lunch though. I patched my leg and then ran into some random hikers from Texas. They gave me some of their bottled water and then carried me out of the trail. I had lunch with them and they offered to row me back to the island where I could stay in their cabin. I declined and waited for my crew at the beginning of the trail instead of 2 hours in. \n\nIf you want to avoid everything I\u2019ve ever lost a Mario to, that\u2019s a sandvic, a shovel, a pick axe, a rusty nail sticking out of a board (that one was a tetanus shot moment!) trail biking, a very thorny bush, falling down a hill, falling up a hill, and friendly fire (accidental stabbing by a friend at lunch).",

Only water with crappy single use plastic bottle lids that spilled few times yeah. And for medical use in medkits u always have alcohol wipes, those are best and meant for cleaning wounds. I personally have those.\n\nGawd dayum I never would consider rock as a such a sharp object lol. Good to point that out. I usually dont watch out for rocks but to be fair I never rly rock -  climb. I only hike on foot.\n\n I injure myself on regular basis so I am rly resilient. The thing that usually happens to me is minor cuts though. Like rly weak cuts lol. I can always walk it off easily, even bruising. To be fair im cautious and hike rly safely (not like cowardly safely but positively safely). I never hike for multiple days, here in EU u rly can't only somewhere far. I always carry extra food / NEED to buy eater filter cuz water is twenty times more important, I found that out on one hike, each hike I always improve lol. Buy more equipment etc. Last big multi day hike my whole family was low on water etc on a mountain. I \"wished\" literal camelbag for Christmas and chose which one lol, I think it holds idk, 2 liters of water? Idk. + I have small, rly well equipped IFAK. All this for hikes.\n\nActually though let me also tell a short story. Weather is more my enemy looks like. I went on a one day hike once, same trip like the one I mentioned but different hike. 3 family members, all girls, and me, a guy. It was rly beautiful nature. It started raining though. And quite badly. It was summer so obviously we had short clothing etc but we were rdy for a rain. I had a brand new (again, I improved from last time!!!) Raincoat. It was pretty big, literally covered me down to the ground from rain. I was covered from wind ( i had a good jacket I put on + only bad thing was I had shorts) and from rain almost 95%. So we hiked easily and Im big lover of rain and even on hikes if i get completely soaked for hours im okay afterwards but i have no idea what it was but when we came back to our room, I got extremely ill for the rest of the day. Was shaking and trembling like crazy. Even in the biggest rain, with no raincoat, I never am this badly affected afterwards. And the hike was completely fine I enjoyed it etc. No bad feeling, nothing. But then I come home and I am absolutely shaking and cold as F*CK even under a blanket. It was this that Im super cold one second and the other im sweating like a madman and am extremely hot. Idk what illness it was but it felt horrible. I felt so weakened too.\n\nFelt like malaria LOL seriously. No diarrhea and vomiting but I felt exactly like malaria would. Weakness, sweating, chills, headache etc.\n\n\nLol.\n\nSo no one even knew about ur wound?\n\nWho's a Mario? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBtw greaaat story I enjoyed reading it a lot! Thanks sm for info!",

Yes, I know stuff happens, but redundancy saves lives. \n\nThat said, you should use some of the formerly boiled water to rinse the wound of as much debris as possible. Then, affix a clean dressing over it. It is important to change with a NEW dressing if there are signs of drainage/infection. Some bacteria are resistant to temps under 240 degrees F. Botulinum toxin is one. If you have a topical anti-microbial agent, use it under the bandage. For short periods it may be ok to apply the anti-microbial agent to the cloth, but you have to be mindful that it may cause maceration and degrade the tissue further.",

I even know places on ur body that are super, super hard to control bleeding if you get attacked there. Rare place that is rly hard to heal is armpits (huge vein under there) - but in those you could just put a ton of bandage and squeeze it in the armpits to stop the bleeding but its very tricky. But usually no one attacks u there. And also neck is very very sensitive area that usually is left out. Helmet protects your head only, usually, and chest is usually protected by armor lol. Armor can have attachments for protecting shoulders, upper arms, groin and in very specific times you can have upper leg protectors even. And you CAN have a neck protector attached to the vest but it is super rare. Usually neck is exposed along with the armpits. Imagine someone slashing ur throat/ or stabbing u in one of the armpits. In both u got only few tens of seconds before u bleed to death and u need to stop the bleeding ASAP.\n\nYou reminded me all this by your instance where your guy had same rare wound in the groin leading to his mid buttocks.",

Puncture wounds can be hard to treat due to the possible involvement of even small arteries and tear/crush type tissue damage. I would rather have a cut than stab wound to deal with, depending on where, of course. I have a suture trainer that I need to start practicing on. It is only for skin. Artery repair is very next level!\n\nUnfortunately, if you have a major artery or vein like the jugular that is perforated, you don't have many options if you are away from a trauma center. In the brachial/arm pit or groin, you can't use a tourniquet. So pressure will only buy you a little time, but if a major vein or artery is severed, it is only a matter of time. Pressure dressings are generally to get you to a place that can treat you. If you don't get quality medical treatment, you have an appointment with Jesus. \n\nAll the chest seals and pressure dressings are useless unless someone can repair the arteries and replace the lost blood in a relatively short time. The blood loss/hypovolemia will cause tachycardia and your BP to tank below the ability for the heart to perfuse itself and with the added contractions per minute, it is a losing battle.  Your other organs will fail quickly, and it's game over.",

It is to slow blood flow enough to allow clotting and slow blood loss. If you apply enough pressure to completely staunch blood flow, you can cause tissue death = necrosis. If you don't, you can bleed to death. That is why tourniquets have a place to write the time they are applied. In the arm pit, it is possible but difficult to apply enough pressure to STOP blood flow through  the brachial artery to prevent bleeding out, but you will eventually have to remove pressure. Either you will lose/ have lost the arm due to necrosis, or you will have to amputate to \"clamp off\" the arteries and prevent bleeding out. You will also have to take a flap of living tissue to cover the surgical wound and close the site to prevent infection and allow it to heal. Even in an operating suite, this is a complicated procedure, and infection is likely even with antibiotics. A field amputation is horrible, and the person is likely to die from infection even with a skilled surgeon. Most deaths during wars prior to WW1 were from infection, not a direct result of the wound.\n\nAnother thing it that when you eventually take pressure off, a piece of a clot may break loose and become an embolus and go to an organ and kill you. Most likely are the lungs, brain, and  heart. But liver or kidneys will do it too.",

So much so that the pressure in evew2n a small artery in your finger can send blood to an 8 foot ceiling from the floor.\n\nPlus, arteries are smooth muscle, which means they pulse/contact. So, it takes a good amount of pressure to stop flow and the possibility of it healing on its own are small since in order to heal, you have to align the severed parts and keep them that way until they repair. And it has to be done while under pressure. \n\nIt would take an anatomy and physiology lesson on the circulatory system and the clotting and healing processes to fully explain. But, what is involved with the successful treatment of a severed artery is very complicated and extremely unlikely to be successful outside of an OR with a very skilled surgeon. I have witnessed general surgeon's refuse to do another part of an abdominal surgery because of their uncertainty about the arterial location of an organ due to it being outside their specialty. They kept the patient in their suite waiting on the other surgeon to finish his operation. They coordinated on the entry points for the laproscopic surgery.",

I would suggest to keep the dressings as clean as possible. From what was written this is good. I would suggest a dry dressing to cover - anything made of cotton will not hold up well with fire (think of making tinder).  Boiled and air dry with a ton of sun okay. Limit your touching of the dressing.\n2. Reminder trench warfare (WWI) left wounds open ( not sutured), covered with a field dressing, etc., and we are not talking blast injury or high velocity injury. Those are separate issues and can be looked at - but not as laid out as this situation. There are historical accounting of this. They also used to put antibiotics in open wounds.\n3. Reminder you have an immune system - it does amazing things.  Get out there and allow the body to be exposed to all the things. So your immune system is active. Think Kids in the ball pit at the mall. Kids bounce back fast and the parents struggle a little - type process.\n4. reading your scenario  a clean dry dressing changed at regular intervals would be a good start. If its soaked through change the outer dressing and try to get to safe zone.\n\nAs an example of people I have cared for open wounds left open for several days. Yes the wounds were nasty but the people lived. Think fly's buzzing around the dressing and rinsing maggots out the wound. But the person lived. \n\nAlso - a good read [source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-02/the-girl-who-fell-3km-into-the-amazon-and-survived/101413154) \\- the story of a 11y/o girl surviving the jungle. She used gas to kill the maggots and pull them out. There was also a movie made about her story. Juliane Koepcke.",

Moss would be another decent option as a barrier between the wound and the dirty cloth that most people would be pretty familiar with.  Let's say it's winter though.  I wouldn't be too worried about a superficial wound during the winter.  I would just focus on keeping it clean, maybe rinsing the wound off with clean water a few times a day.  If it's hot and humid, the chances of it getting infected go up significantly compared to it being the dead of winter, and that's when I might be concerned about wanting to cover it with a clean bandage of some kind.  In that scenario, barring plant knowledge, and I have a something to boil water in, I wouldn't bother boiling the cloth.  I'd take two cloths, one damp, the other not, and stick them in the pot over the fire or on the coals.  Damp cloth goes on the bottom as a makeshift rack for the dry cloth that you will be using as a bandage.  The goal is to get the pot up to at least 165\u00b0F for about 5 minutes to kill off most bacteria.  The damp cloth prevents the dry cloth from burning on the bottom of the pot and if that one survives, then you can use it as a bandage too.  Anyway, this will produce a ready to use bandage without needing to dry it out.",

            "comment": "First... let's be clear. A boiled rag does not necessarily mean its clean. Sterilization through heat will presumably kill any bacteria and/or biological contamination... but that doesn't make the rags clean. There are other sources of \"soiling\" that pose a risk to human health. For example... if the rags were taken from a mechanics workbench they would likely be covered in all kinds of additional substances. Following a boil (for long enough time) the rag won't have any living infectious materials... but infection can result from any foreign material. If you introduce dirt, grease, other chemicals... even though they've been boiled, they can still contaminate the wound and cause infection.\n\nSecond, wet cloth expands when wet. It's capable of stretching. As it dries, even a lose wet wrap, can become excessively tight. Care should be used to loosen the wrapping as it dries. Wet surfaces also naturally collect more outside contamination to them, so they will soil faster. Additionally, wet rags can prevent clotting, thus facilitating additional blood loss. \n\nAll that being said... its a question of available resources. Is additional aid nearby? Higher medical facilities with antibiotics, better bandages, etc.... if the wrap is going to be super temporary... and you have the ability to address contamination right away... I wouldn't bother with the boiling. I'd just wrap it, unsterile and move to aid. \n\nSomething to keep in mind. Wraps and bandages exist to protect the wound from contamination and/or stop bleeding. \nIf it's bleeding badly (like life-threatening)... tourniquet it and wrap it in anything... get to aid. \nIf it's not bleeding badly (as in you have enough time to boil and dry rags) then it's not about stemming the bleeding. Then it's a question of which is the greater source of further contamination... the rags, or the environment. If you're hiking down a mountain, in a windstorm... cover it. If you're getting in a vehicle and driving to a hospital... leave it exposed.",

It can also be used to clean the wound and get dirt away from the cut. Infections can kill, even tiny ones. \n\nDepending on situation, first stop the bleeding. Then clean the wound as best as you can and do a good wrap.",

            "comment": "I recently cut myself very badly. I went into shock and drove home instead of getting stitches. Luckily I have a decent first aid kit and despite passing out once (while stopped at a red light!) I made it home safely, bandaged my wound, and got on with my life.\n\n3 weeks later it's healed enough to remove the gauze &amp; compression wrap and start using the NewSkin antiseptic/glue. But I went 3 weeks having to shower by completely covering my bandages with athletic tape &amp; then a layer of duct tape to keep it dry. I kept the bandages on for days at a time, only changing it maybe 5-6 times over those three weeks. \n\nThe point here is that sterilizing your clothes is essentially pointless. The initial bandaging will be removed within a few days and the wound will need to be redressed and rebandaged. It really doesn't matter at all whether your boiled the clothes you used to dress your wound. In fact it likely would be the wrong move, after you clean the wound it needs to stay dry. Your bandages should be bone dry, never wet. \n\nSo first things first, you take your cleanest clothes and stop the bleeding, then don't touch it for 24-48 hours. It'll start to scab up so the faster you change the first bandages, the better. Once it starts to scab it will bond with your bandages and you will have to rip them off and restart the bleeding. That's just how wounds work. \n\nYou clean it, you dress it, you leave it alone for a day, or two if it's really deep cut. You change your bandages, it will hurt. But you must do this. You rip off the old, you clean it, you redress it.  You need to look at it every few days to make sure it isn't changing color. That's bad.",

            "comment": "Having water in the bandage isnt good. Its not just a matter of starting with a dry rag but how to keep it dry while you are wearing it.\n\nPersonally, if the wound is not at risk of constant bleeding and i dont need to keep pressure on it, then i would rather clean the wound really well, make sure theres no debris in the wound and then smear pine resin on it. The pine resin is really hydrophobic and antibacterial on its own. Itd be better for preventing contamination.\n\nYou mostly cover wounds to slow and stop bleeding rather than prevent contamination since its nearly impossible to keep the dressing clean and dry enough in that environment. At that point, the benefits of bandaging outweigh the risks.",

To keep more than one rag relatively clean, wrap it in the other rags you boiled and dried.  Might be nice to keep a 1 gallon ziplock on hand for events like this.\n\nA little bit of bleeding is a good thing.  It flushes out any contaminants from the wound.  Especially puncture wounds, make that bleed as much as possible.",

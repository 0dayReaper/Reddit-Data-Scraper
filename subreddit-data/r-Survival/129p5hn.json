If you find Gatorade bottles you don't even have to do any bushcraft. Just put them in the water. Fish are not smart. They swim into the opening and get stuck. Gatorade bottles have larger openings and a larger storage container which is why they are ideal. But you can make traps pretty easily. \n\n2- Nets. Weaving a net is rather simple if tedious. But we are talking a true survival scenario so you have nothing but time. \n\n3 - You set multiple poles. An L7 trigger works very well for fishing and are simple to manufacture. \n\nThus better odds than hunting birds.",

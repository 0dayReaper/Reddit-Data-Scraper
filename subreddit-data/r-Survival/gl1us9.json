People are asking because they *like your work* and want to buy from you. This could become a great revenue stream for you and help you grow your business but you *have to be transparent* on your pricing. This is one of the things that will build trust in your brand.\n\nPeople don\u2019t need to know what it costs *you* to make them, but they do need to know that they\u2019re being given a fair price that *everyone else* is paying, instead of worrying that you  charged them more because you\u2019ve kept your pricing secret.\n\n\nYou do good work, the knife looks great. *You should proudly stand by your work,* rather than asking for DMs to keep your pricing secret. \n\nIf you\u2019re unsure of what you should charge for something like that, maybe take a poll or something to see what other people would value it as. Doing the whole \u201cdm me\u201d thing just looks sketchy, especially after other people have asked for you to post pricing and you just respond with \u201cdm me.\u201d\n\nLike I said, you do good work and it looks a hell of a lot better than a lot of \u201cestablished\u201d knife makers I\u2019ve seen on here. \n\nBe proud of your work. Stand by it.\n\nEdit: A great example is this: imagine you walk into a store and you see something you really want to buy. There\u2019s other people in the store already and they\u2019re looking at the same thing. You and others say to the shopkeeper, \u201cI don\u2019t see a price here; how much is this?\u201d \n\nIf the shopkeeper kept taking each individual customer to another room and whispered the price to them, would you still want to buy from them? Would you trust that you were getting fair and honest pricing or would you feel like you may have been given a different price, for one reason or another? Personally, I wouldn\u2019t and I wouldn\u2019t shop there again unless prices were posted for all of the customers to see.",

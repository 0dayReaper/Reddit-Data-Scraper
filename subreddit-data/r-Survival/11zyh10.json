    "postText": "Headed to Glacier National Park (US side - Montana) in September for a solo 6-7 night 60-70 mile solo backpacking trip, in addition to bear spray, as a last resort, should I take:\n \n* My Sig 365XL with a 12 round mag, or 15 round mag\n* My P320 m18 with a 17 or 21 round mag?\n* don't take those, buy a whole separate 10mm (glock 20 etc), (I would rather not due to budget constraints -- and I don't see a use for it outside of this trip for the present time being).  \n* don't take a gun, just carry bear spray\n\nAlso chest or drop holster?  Trying to figure out something I could mount bear spray + firearm to in addition to wearing a 70L Mountain Hardwear pack.  Any recommendations? \n\nIs Lehigh Extreme Penetrator the right bullet?  Underwood Hardcast +p?  \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: wow never expected so many comments! Appreciate so much your perspectives.  Some comments were saying an attack isn't likely with good food storage and hiking discipline.  I'm an eagle scout and have spent probably 100+ nights backcountry solo but have never spent any time in grizzly country so that was a new level of complexity I haven't encountered before.  Given daily mileages I won't have lots of extra time to be off trail so my hope is bears will know these are human frequented areas.  \n\nI will definitely be taking bear spray mounted on my packs shoulder straps and think it's the right go-to option, I'm just wondering about a backup option especially in cases like being in your tent at night and being attacked where bear spray might be difficult to deploy.  I've never hiked in a national park with a firearm before so weighing the cost benefit ratio for extra weight involved.  Not sold on the necessity of a firearm for this use case just yet.\n\nThat being said [it seems like firearms of all calibers have had a positive outcome with respect to bear attacks](https://www.ammoland.com/2021/06/handgun-or-pistol-against-bear-attacks-104-cases-97-effective/).  I'm also not sure if you have bear spray and a firearm how you would deploy them sequentially since a charging bear would give you time for really only one option.  \n\nI have run into an adult black bear around a bend at mt rainier on the wonderland trail at a couple hundred feet (had no bear spray), and handled it pretty well I think.  Just put up my trekking poles in the air (I'm also quite tall) and talked calmly to the bear and he ran up a tree in a nearby thicket and I just side stepped facing him until I was out of the area.",

            "comment": "As I\u2019m sure many people have said use bear spray, making a wall of deterrent is more effective than aiming in extreme situations at a target that\u2019s potentially charging you and on all fours makes it even tougher to line up the shot, not to mention the only target you have on a charging bear is it\u2019s brain cause it will keep coming at you if you don\u2019t put it down, which lessens the chance of hitting, I\u2019ve taught hunters Ed in Montana and trust me when I say, you have better odds with the spray. As per what rounds to use people have already said better than I can what to use but just make sure that that\u2019s a last resort",

I worked in Glacier for over a year, have logged over 300 miles of backpacking in the park and have never once had to use my bear spray (even the time i was looking down while bushwhacking and when I looked up there was a grizzly chomping on berries 20 feet away). Carry spray, be mindful of your surroundings, store your food properly- this one is the most important- and don\u2019t approach any bears or bushwhack in thick areas where you could sneak up on them (like my stupid 22 year old self). There have only been 10 bear attacks in Glacier since 1967 after they starting actually managing backcountry food and trash, therefore bear/human interactions.",

                    "comment": "IIRC (used to work at several national parks), you can *carry* a legally-owned handgun. It is still a violation of federal law to *fire* it. My colleague's brother was arrested in Crater Lake NP not because he was carrying, but because he discharged it within the park.\n\nAdditionally, the NPS scrutinized brownie deaths very, very carefully. Unless you can prove it was basically killing you, you'll be in a lot of trouble. Cue all the folks saying \"well if it's killing you, you'll want the gun!\" Sure, but problem with that is so few grizzly attacks (which are already so rare) have evidence that it *would have been* fatal &amp; a gunshot wound was required. Are you confident you can compellingly convince a jury, against an attorney from the DOI (who are generally far better paid than an attorney most of us can afford) that your discharging a firearm at a brownie was truly life-or-death with no other options? Most bear encounters end without an attack, or even mock charging. I'd strongly recommend against bringing a gun.\n\nSource: besides working at several National Parks, also lived in AK &amp; worked in the backcountry there. Unless you're a trained bear guard (&amp; even all of them have had only 1 time they needed to kill a grizzly in recent memory), just leave the gun at home. Too many ways for it to go wrong, in the backcountry &amp; in court. Bear spray &amp; awareness of your surroundings will be more effective.  \n\n**edit, still mulling on this:** Also, of course there is something to be said for \"better judged by 12 than carried by 6.\"  My main point is that unless someone has had training for that kind of circumstance (e.g., as a bear guard) then it may not be their *most effective* tool. And I can appreciate the idea of using a gun as a sort of parachute; \"you'll want it if you need it.\"  But do most folks carry a parachute with them on all of their domestic flights? Quick napkin math (&amp; please point out if I screwed up on this, we all make math mistakes sometimes):  \n\n* odds of being in a plane crash, 1 in 11mil  \n* odds of being *attacked* by a bear (not killed), 1 in 2.7 mil  \n* 11% of bear attacks are fatal. So if I did my math right, odds of being in a *fatal* bear attack are 1 in 24mil (plus 454545 repeat as change). You could absolutely be that one unlucky bastard, but if you're going off of math, you should start bringing a parachute on all your plane travel before you need to start carrying a backup gun for bear encounters.  Your odds are far higher of being judged by the 12 and the fancy-pants fed attorney because you mishandled a weapon in a non-fatal encounter. But as long as people know how to *safely* and *responsibly* use weapons, and it is legal for them to carry, how they view those odds are up to them.",

So if the mythbusters proved it's 18 feet with a human with one knife you'd probably need 40 feet from a bear with 20 blades... \n\nOn another note, all the weapons the OP listed would just piss a grizzly off. If you wanted to survive a grizzly attack you'd need a .44, to be extremely experienced in firearms handling, lucky as hell and probably also a good 30 feet to get prepared.",

Grizzlies are way more aggressive in Yellowstone than Alaska due to food scarcity.  Current statistics indicate bear mace stops  undesirable behavior in brown bears 92% of time, 90% of time in black bears, 97% in polar bears (though polar bear numbers are the least tested for obvious reasons, they hunt and stalk humans). \n\nI've been with around 5 Yellowstone guides over the years, a couple never encountered a grizzly (they only went places that had limited bears) and the others had been charged a handful of times each.  All carried bear mace, no firearms, none ever sprayed the mace even with the bluff charges when coming on a startled bear.  None  would prefer firearms over the mace, simply because raising and aiming a gun effectively when coming upon a startled bear is practically impossible, whereas a cloud of a super strong mace sprayed frantically, gets the job done over 90% of the time, and if it doesn't \"playing dead\" gives you the best chance of survival for a startled bear.\n\n\nNow on the very very very very very very rare occasion that a grizzly is stalking you or ripping through your tent the mace is still just as effective, \"playing dead\" is not.\n\nI'd have to assume most times in your law career that mace didn't work or tasers for that matter.......narcotics were involved, luckily for us Cocaine bear doesn't happen that often........even less often than a grizzly bear stalking you.\n\nSo maybe for you a firearm may feel better, but like every ranger says or bear book: you don't know how you will react when a grizzly bear charges, until a grizzly bear charges you.  Maybe you could aim effectively.....even if it's dark, even if you don't see it, but only hear it to your left or right, maybe you can raise the gun quick enough, maybe you get off a shot, odds are it doesn't feel it or it makes it more angry.",

They're pretty hard to kill and most people aren't actually very good shots. Once he's shot, he's pissed off and you're definitely going to die, where before he was shot he was probably just curious or maybe a bit defensive at most.\n\nBTW, please do not bring assault rifles into national parks and shoot wildlife, that's considered rude and illegal. Yes, if you took the right steps to attempt to resolve the situation nonlethally first you're allowed to shoot the bear, but if you shoot that bear and an investigation deems that you were wrong to do so ... You're going to wish the bear mauled you. **Remember that you're entering his home, so by many states' laws, he has a right to protect himself more than you do (castle doctrine)!**\n\nI work with the National Parks by the way, we've never had a bear attack on any of our properties, including over 200 operating-years in known bear territory specifically.\n\nP.S.

If you could get a selective fire AR10, it still would not be considered an assault rifle, it would be a battle rifle due to the use of a full power cartridge. An M16/M4 is the full auto variant of the civilian AR15, and they are chambered in a slightly more powerful 22 cartridge that isn't legal to even hunt deer with in most states and in others the minimum cartridge allowed. Also, castle doctrine doesn't apply to animals. Also, their indeed have been bear attacks. My friend's dad had the article.posted, graphic images included, of one particular grizzly mauling as a reminder to his customers not to be complacent and to always heed his advice (being a professional guide and all). Also, no, I'm not the type conservatives worry about. I don't have a history of mental illness other than depression (which 80% of the population has had at one time, even cops). Being in the military and law enforcement will do that (as I've lost brothers and have PTSD from seeing kids die). The people who have schizophrenia, psychosis, and other major psychological disorders. I was never court ordered to go to a mental facility (which is what disqualifies you to purchase a firearm). I ended up there because that is where Ft. Sill sent overflow for medical. Another guy ended up there with me even though he was sent for a fungal infection. We spent two weeks there until sent on to Tinker AFB where he got the appropriate care for his foot and I got cleared by the head doc.

Also, you'll get less sideways looks from the hikers coming the opposite direction when the first thing they see is armament on your chest. Side note, you'll likely be the only person you see in the park that day strapped, including the rangers.\n\nInvest in the same ammo you'll be putting on the bear/moose (frankly I'm more worried about the latter) if you have to, and train with it. Your 10 is going to be a very different kick from your 9 and the last thing you want to do is find that out when you're trying to get 1 or 2 shots off before you're already in it's mouth/antlers.\n\nI don't always carry in the parks particularly on the trails that are full of hikers, but for more remote trails where there's few else if anyone around, just like with hunting, I'd rather have both the spray and the sidearm option than just spray as a last resort.",

Considering 10mm is comparable to .357 magnum (factory ammunition) you have far more capacity than a revolver.

Another symptom of this effect is name dropping random effects you heard of in hopes that nobody knows the definition so you can get away with saying it. Bear spray is a much safer and responsible option to a firearm when facing a bear. \n\n(May i also point out that parentheses are not a part of your sentence. So you said \u201cThe Dunning Kruger in full effect ladies and gently\ud83d\udd3c\u201d which makes no sense since it is the Dunning Kruger Effect not, the Dunning Kruger)",

A 10mm is always going to be your best bet when taking a handgun into the bush for predator defense. Fishing and hunting guides swear by them (Glock 20 for example as you mentioned). However, if you want to bring something in addition to your bear spray, then I\u2019d say go with the 365 and 15 round mags. That way if you never see anything and don\u2019t need to use it, then you won\u2019t regret carrying around the weight of a P320. \n\nFor carrying, I recommend a cheat holster of some sorts. If you have a backpack on, then it will allow you to quickly get to your firearm and keeps it out of the way. Another great option is a cheat pack from Hill People Gear. They make packs just for the reason you are describing. I suppose it also depends on if you have your CCW, but I don\u2019t know Montana state laws well enough. \n\nFor ammo, you are going to want something heavy and solid. Hollow points won\u2019t penetrate thick skin well, especially in 9mm. I\u2019d recommend Buffalo Bore +P ammo for what you are describing. \n\nAs others have mentioned, bear spray should be enough to get the job done, but if you are determined then it is your right to carry your forearm where you like. Have fun and be safe out there.",

Sleeping with a firearm certainly provides a sense of security against animals and people, however I've worked and recreated in some remote areas and most of our calls weren't about animals, they were about other people; people coming up on your tent, even trying to open it, especially females. Several thousand people have gone missing in the wilderness, and few of those involved animals. If you have space, toss a gun in your bag for extra security and a can of spray on your hip.",

Distance between you and an animal will close fast. \n\nSome other advise, practice getting your heart rate up (push-ups, jumping jacks, burpees) in order to simulate adrenaline.",

Getting the shot off and striking it will likely involve some luck.  The chance of success is higher if you have had military training, and I'd still bet on the bear. \n\n/u/PlayingTagWithBears has the best advice here.",

I\u2019m not saying use the handgun first, but if it is a life or death situation, it\u2019s better to have an extra tool to increase the chance of survival, if bear spray did not work. \n\nExercise won\u2019t simulate what adrenaline feels like. But will simulate similar effects like rapid heart rate, shaking to some affect, etc. it is good training.\n\nChances are the regular person hasn\u2019t been in many high stress scenarios which will combat the effects of adrenaline. So any training that simulates it\u2019s effects is helpful. \n\nAlso the OP was asking about firearms, which I answered. I agree with bear proof containers and hanging stuff away from the camp site, etc. to limit the chance of an encounter.",

Underwood is where I would go, but you do not need hard cast ammo. 10mm mono rounds have superior penetration and stopping power. Check Underwood ammo for such.",

Figure this out for walking along a road, in an open field, in the woods. Consider adding a backpack to those to see if there is a significant difference- write them down.\n\nResearch how to do a 1-point resection- write it down.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with map symbols.\n\nGoogle route cards and look at the information that's recorded there.\n\n\nWhen you're not familiar with navigating it's easy to second-guess yourself. When you're filling out a route card or nav logbook write down little things that you will see along your route to give you confidence that you're on the right route.\n\nExample: Leg 2 to 3, small stream around 150 meters in.",

But, you should write down your 100m pace count for all gear variations (i.e. with no pack, with a lightweight day hiking pack, with a fully loaded backpacking setup, and any other possibilities you might wear/use). Your pace count will vary wildly depending on how much weight you're carrying. You should also think about measuring it for when you're full of energy and just starting the day; and when it's the end of the day and you're tired/worn out.\n\nEdit: I have taken a few multi-day navigation courses and when you are in large stretches being off by only a few paces can really get you lost and you'll have no idea until it's too late.",

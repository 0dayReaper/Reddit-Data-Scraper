I considered just throwing a hefty bag into my RuckSack for such occasions but they just aren't durable. Has to be small enough to pack away but In torrential downpour I'd never have to worry about my gear. My bags 40liters.",

They are cheap, durable, light, and completely waterproof. That way - your gear inside is always protected. You don't need to stop and adjust if it starts to rain. Not ideal for the 'swim across a river' scenario - but a better pack liner with a roll top closure may do that job.   \n\nA full pack sized bag would restrict you from actually wearing the backpack. That works for when you are in camp - but at that point wouldn't you have your tent or tarp up to keep you protected? On the go water protection a pack liner is the best option.",

You could fold it up when not needed - then unfold and jam your pack into it for the river crossing. They are quality brands and should be waterproof for your needs.

Basically you roll the top up, it has a semi-rigid plastic bar to roll tightly against, then clip the two ends together to bend the plastic which pulls the rolled up fabric tight. With smaller bags that's also your handle.\n\nIt's not just water tight, it's even air tight (except the compression options, which do let air out). They say none of these bags can handle being fully submerged in water but I suspect even then it would be fine as long as you don't go too deep under or leave it under water for a long time.\n\nKeep in mind condensation can be a problem. If the air is humid, there might be 30ml (1fl oz) of water just in the air inside your backpack, and with a temperature change (especially if it gets colder - like if you move the bag from sunlight into shade) the air won't be able to hold that water anymore, so it'll condensate inside the bag. If you *absolutely* need things to be dry inside the bag, you need to dry out the air with something like this: https://www.pelican.com/au/en/accessory/cases/desiccant-silica-gel/1500d",

I still use a pack cover in addition to that though, a wet pack is heavier and shitty to wear especially over a good distance.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget solution, I'd second trying out the suggestion of using contractor's trash bags or maybe making your own out of a few layers of tyvek?",

They're just big dry bags that you can buy at any hiking store. \n\nBut I also separate my gear into smaller dry bags before packing them into my big pack liner. That way, if I have to swim or wade chest deep my gear is always dry and I squeeze more gear in.",

            "comment": "I buy smaller dry bags and bag everything that is sensitive to moisture, then put those in my pack. Anything that would be for-sure destroyed (electronics) or is vital to survival (sleeping bag, dry change of clothing) gets double bagged.\n\nThat's for a normal trip. Fabric dry bags weight very little than regular ditty bags, all things considered, and can save your butt.  Plus everything is now organized.\n\nIf I absolutely knew I was going to swim a river or something, I'd pack a heavy duty garbage bag and a pool inner tube. Stick your gear on the float, try not to completely submerge it, and paddle across with it. No dry bag is 100% -- they're added insurance, but I assume they'll always leak. To directly answer your question, contractor grade trash bags can be had at Home Depot/Lowes/etc if you're in the US, and they should be durable enough for several crossings.\n\nAnything really sensitive to water gets stuck at the top of my pack, too. That way if I unexpectedly land on my ass in a creek when splashing across, it's something at the bottom of my pack like my fuel canisters and my freeze dried meal pouches and air mattress that get dunked, not my sleeping bag or camera gear that goes swimming.",

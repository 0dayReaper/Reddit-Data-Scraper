    "postText": "So I\u2019m looking for an every day watch that has solar capabilities and an accurate compass. The primary use for this watch will be daily use but also used for hunting and snorkeling/swimming. Everything else that can be included are really just pluses. Does anyone have any suggestions? I was looking into the Casio Rangeman but they just seem too big and bulky. Also considering the Garmin Solar Instinct 2. Let\u2019s hear what y\u2019all have to suggest",

I've  been wearing my PRG-270 for some 7 years before I upgraded to something with more capabilities, but I still love my little protrek dearly, and chuck it into the rucksack as a backup of the backup, just in case.\n\nGreat, resilient and sturdy. Full charge (few hours in summer sun, 30 minutes in the light of all my torches) lasts for up to 7 months. Allegedly, because I never went below half charge.",

            "comment": "As far as I am aware the Garmin Instinct has by far the longest battery life on normal modes.  I only have to charge mine about twice a month.\n\n\nThey have some other models but those tend to be more along the lines of \"up to\" 7 days between charging, or the life is measured in hours like \"up to 30 hours\".\n\nMaybe there's some newer models now, but most of the brands are going more for luxury performance based options instead of functional reliable options.  It's cool and all that watches now can make calls and pair with bluetooth headphones and track your diet, but at the same time the idea of having to charge your watch every day is a bit silly.\n\n\nOther watches you're likely to need to bring a folding solar panel with you to keep them running.",

I have a feeling I\u2019m going to end up with both. The battery life is what sold me. The instinct absolutely has the better functions but more than what I started in the market for. \n\nI greatly appreciate everyone\u2019s insight!",

The compass doesn't get confused by magnetic objects (I can have a metal wrist band on my compass watch!) and it can be configured to show true north instead of magnetic north (it shows magnetic by default).\n\nYou can also lock in a bearing, save waypoints, etc. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210324\n\nDoesn't have a solar panel but neither does my phone and I always have that with me to take photos. For longer trips (a few days or more) I pack a solar charger that provides power to both, as well as a few other electronics (lighting, arc lighter, etc).\n\nPretty good as a watch too, for example it shows sunset/sunrise with a slick graphical display behind the watch face. https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-eerie-beauty-of-the-apple-watch-solar-face-and-the-anatomy-of-nightfall",

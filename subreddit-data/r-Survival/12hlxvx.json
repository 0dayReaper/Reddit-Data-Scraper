It's a physical limitation of the frequencies handheld radios operate at (Higher VHF and UHF)\n\nAs an unlicensed person you will be limited to FRS or GMRS channels.

The first level (tech) is pretty basic and allows for you to use the handheld as you wish (within certain frequency spaces) *this is in the US so your country may be different \n\nIt goes without saying but if it's a TRUE emergency then you can use any means available to you.",

First of all it only has enough bandwidth to send a text alert that you need help. Second it actually displays guidance on the screen telling you how to physically align the phone so the antenna is pointing towards the closest satellite, and you're aiming for a \"Low Earth Orbit\" satellite which might be moving at 17,000mph (though thanks to the distance, it still doesn't seem that fast from the ground... but it is moving and the angle is always going to be different).\n\nThe feature will come to other phones. It's not that difficult to implement really and I'm pretty sure all the patents are available at \"fair\" prices.",

I could be totally off base on that but I can tell you with 100% certainty iPhone is the first commercial cell phone that also has a dedicated Satellite emergency mode.",

The blackberry, for example, was pretty well loved.\n\nAnd I'd argue even the Newton worked better than the original iPhone. Pretty sure it had copy/paste for example. And it was able to run third party software. The only thing it really lacked was a good cell network (which, again, was something the original iPhone didn't do well at - it didn't have 3G for example even though every other high end phone had it at the time).\n\nThe iPhone is the best smartphone available, but part of that is because the company spends a very long time in the R&amp;D phase which generally means they ship new features years after other manufacturers. This is one of the rare exceptions.",

There are no limits/charges for using the satellite SOS capability to communicate with the emergency service center. That takes the form of an initial survey you fill out on the phone and transmit. (This predefined survey can be compressed super small so it transmits the answers to these most important questions quickly). After that you actually conduct two-way text messaging with the emergency center, who triage and either walk you through self-rescue or liase with local authorities/SAR who decide what emergency services to dispatch.  The communication is free, but the services they dispatch may not be: eg a helicopter evac in a National Park is often free, but in a National Forest and many other places it may set you back $15-25,000. Generally around 1/10th that for an extraction via horse/mule. Apple\u2019s so far only indicated that the satellite communications would be free of charge for at least the first two years with a new phone purchase. Remains to be seen if/how much they\u2019ll start charging 1.5 years from now when the first buyers like me hit that point. But whatever they\u2019re charging I\u2019d assume it\u2019ll be a lot less than the $12/month I was paying for the service on my Garmin inReach.",

So every time I tried to call for help it would redirect to  Globalstar, and even though I told 1 of their people who to call about activating because I was broke down they wouldn\u2019t help me.

You might want to keep an old cell phone and car-charger for it in your emergency car kit.  \n\n*All wireless phones, even those that are not subscribed to or supported by a specific carrier, can call 911. However, calls to 911 on phones without active service do not deliver the caller\u2019s location to the 911 call center, and the call center cannot call these phones back to find out the caller\u2019s location or the nature of the emergency. If disconnected, the 911 center has no way to call back the caller.*\n\nhttps://www.911.gov/calling-911/frequently-asked-questions/",

There may be some available 5g service broadcast via satellite iirc, or at least that's in the works (my maps seem to work just fine if i have no service but have location on, though im unsure of its potential for satellite connectivity). Typically you need access to a dedicated satphone to use em for communication, some smartphones may connect to them specifically for navigation only. \n\nIf you say just have a deactivated phone/sim you can still call 911 assuming you have at least one bar though. \n\nYour best bet is to invest in a satphone, or at the minimum a satellite or radio beacon. CB and a couple of slinkys could save you in a pinch as well.",

This is why they sometimes give phones to domestic abuse victims. The phones will still call 911 even if there is no paid up service. It will not however, in my humble opinion work if there is no service due to there not being any local towers operational. There is no satellite to pick up your signal in an emergency. You can purchase an Satellite phone that will work in cell phone no service areas. A cell phone is called a cell phone because they operate off of local towers. They ping off these tower which is how the cops find you in an emergency. They triangulate your signal off three towers. You need the towers to be able to call 911 THERE IS NO IMAGINARY SATELLITE \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f\ud83d\udce1 TO SAVE YOUR A$$ in an emergency. Just pay the bill.  Have a nice day.",

There are plans to include satellite capabilities in and round and iPhones but it\u2019s not been entirely worked out yet. However, the Iridium Go is a small device that turns your phone into a sat phone. It connects via Bluetooth and is small and portable. Not sure about the cost or plans though, I\u2019m waiting for customer service to respond to my inquiry. There\u2019s also Zoleo, and Spot, which are sat link devices but more on the text message/beacon side. Great to have in an emergency but not for conversational use. For me, in any no cell service area I carry three essential items. A good first aid kit, a reliable firearm and a good full tang knife. That and a whole lot of awareness\u2026 good luck",

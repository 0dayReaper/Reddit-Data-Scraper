    "postText": "Forecast called for light cloud cover, but no rain. Well while I took a break from checking the sap lines, the wind picked up and the rain started falling quite steadily. Threw up a quick debris shelter to keep me and my gear dry. Had to wait it out for a few hours, but a cup of tea and a few chapters of a book made it an enjoyable afternoon. Plus I got to practice some skills which is always worthwhile!",

They hold and reflect an awful lot of heat from relatively small fires. Plus it makes it much easier than having to clear away 100 years worth of dead leaves so I don't make the news as the guy who burned down Vermont.",

There's a lot of shit laying around up here. The only thing I cut was the ridge pole, and I used the top half after it split off for some of the uprights. Everything else was sturdy dead fall. Plus I didn't use any cordage. Everything is laced together and held in place by friction and weight. I only needed this to last an afternoon. This is on the way to one of my sap lines so I had already built the fire pit earlier in the season because I decided I liked this spot. That also meant I had a good sized pile of debris already stacked up from prepping the site earlier. I am thinking about making something a little more permanent because those two rocks in the middle are perfectly situated where if I sit in between them I can lean back against the one closest to the shelter wall and post my legs up on the one in front. Its like a very firm lazy boy recliner!",

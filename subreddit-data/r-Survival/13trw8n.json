    "postText": "Have a very close childhood friend coming home on leave this summer and I want to get some gifts for him. The most important detail is that he is an 0326 Recon Marine. For context, he is typically part of a *very* small reconnaissance element (like 6 guys or less) who's objective is to infiltrate into hostile territory in order to conduct PIR-satisfying deep reconnaissance without being detected. I was an 0231 and was lucky as shit to take part in the same op as him *once* (sadly I didn't get to debrief him like I wanted to) but I got out after my first enlistment while he kept going. The guy is just built different. \n\nAnyways he is trained on how to live off the land while conducting deep reconnaissance. I want to get him some gucci gifts to help with this. I've already decided on a F\u00e4llkniven knife and a good kydex sheath to go with it. \n\n*Now I just need a quality portable sharpener to pair with the knife. Any recommendations?*",

The leather strap is fantastic, but we can use our own bodies in a pinch! If nothing else, I push shaving razors along my arm (not drag) 2-3 times when I\u2019m done shaving every time. It easily tripled the lifespan of those lil blades.",

It was an extra-fine one, so I already spent a bunch of time on the blade before I got to that stone. And just a couple of rubs and I could feel something wasn't right, noticed a couple of notches taken out of the blade, then found this tiny grain stuck to the Diasharp stone. It took me another hour to fix my blade. I'm still pissed about that and will never use another DMT product.",

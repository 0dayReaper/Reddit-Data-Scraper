            "comment": "It depends on what you're looking for.\n\nFor myself, the biggest benefits of a Mora is that they are inexpensive for good quality, are very lightweight for their size, long lasting but not something I would cry over if I dropped it in a river or off a cliff, and simple in use and maintenance.\n\nSo I have a Mora Companion for my hiking/bugout bag (120g, 18usd), a Mora Craftline in the car (110g, 10usd), Opinel for the lunch box (10g, 10usd), and a generic made in china multitool with a liner lock folding pocket knife for EDC (200g, 10usd).  All this came at a total cost under 50usd and a total weight range of under 500g.\n\nSo in 90% of circumstances I probably have some type of tool.  Along with potentially having multiple tools which are useful for many different needs and circumstances.  If I need something for chopping, hammering, or splitting I can get a basic hatchet for 7-30usd easily.  Though they will add between 500-1000g in weight the fact they offer a much wider practical capability set is more than enough justification for it to me. \n\nThe Garberg is a lot heavier at 280g on its own, is about 2 times more expensive at 80-110usd, and the main improvements is the sheath and tang.  Other full tang knives also exist and classic examples like the Ontario Kabar have historically been used for survival and combat before.  Though often at a similar price point (kabar is 70-100usd) and often a bit heavier than the Garberg (kabar is 310g).\n\nI think if you really want to spend more money and get a significantly strong knife without extra weight a Esee is a good option. With the esee 3 being about 120g and the esee 4 being about 230g.  Though both are about 120-170usd so you're paying nearly 2-4 times as much as buying 4 different knives.",

I usually get the carbon steel ones, but my mom\u2019s birthday is tomorrow and part of her birthday gift is a stainless companion in bright orange. She\u2019s been spending more time at our property in MT so I thought she should have a good reliable knife.",

Any stainless Mora would be a great addition. I\u2019d save the carbon ones for home/yard work where I can clean and dry it easily.",

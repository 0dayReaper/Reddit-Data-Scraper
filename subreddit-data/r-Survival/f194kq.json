How much time would you spend shaping branches with a hatchet? Finding a tree with suitable bark, peeling the bark, shaping the bark, realizing building with bark is pain in the ass and you'll need a frame to keep your  now broken chunks of bark in place?\n\nWith the time and effort it would take building a gimmicky, falling apart trap you half remember seeing in a gif once you could have made half a dozen figure 4 dead falls and bird snares.",

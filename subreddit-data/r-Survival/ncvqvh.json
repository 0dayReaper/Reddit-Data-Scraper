In a real survival situation in the wild you will be spending the vast majority of your time just trying to get enough food to break even calorie wise.\n \n  \nSo I suggest spending the 30min-4 hours that I have seen bow drilling take (each use) and instead using it to create and learn how to use fire starting redundancies that can include: lighter (this is another flint and steel too), magnifying glasses, flint and steel, an ember carrier so you just have to blow, learning to create charcoal cloth and the like, etc. these are what will keep you both efficient and alive, and that should always be the ultimate goal of learning survivalist material. \n \n \nOne last pill if you are willing to take it, in a real long term survival situation (like a month or more is my guess) hunting will not save you. Just like in the Great Depression the woods will be picked clean of all game and livestock as the hunters starve to death, the only viable long term food sources will be raising livestock (bunny is best, prolific) and selective farming of high calorie and nutrients rich plants. My biggest suggestion is to try and learn some from the Amish, they have the closest connection to long term survival behavior that you can immediately learn from.",

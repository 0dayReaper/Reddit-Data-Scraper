Have you guys found any helpful apps that would be a good place to start learning these types of things? Or even books? Aside from Boy Scout type situations, how would you recommend I increase my knowledge on this sort of thing?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! You\u2019ve all been a ton of help and have provided tons of helpful resources. \ud83d\ude01",

Take notes, buy some second hand books from those authors etc.  \nGo out just for a few hours at a time and practise some of the skills, be patient and accept that it takes a good bit of practise.   \nWhat you\u2019re aiming for with wanting to go out and live for a few days in the wilderness is hobby survival, or a survival challenge, rather than strictly emergency \u2018get the hell out as fast as possible\u2019 survival.   \nJohn Plant\u2019s \u2018Primitive Technology\u2019 YouTube series is a fascinating watch too, for ideas and methods with all primitive tools.",

            "comment": "OK, I'm assuming you're in the US because of the Boy Scout reference and the US is kind of the default location on Reddit when a location isn't mentioned. First, there's more to know than can ever be known so breaking knowledge down to specific tasks skills and situations is the way to slowly build your outdoor skills and knowledge. Define some specific needs, find several sources for knowledge/information/instruction, use them and learn the skills to fill that need. Some \"best' sources will be apps and some, actually most, will be books.  In my experience books and apps both have their values, different tools for different tasks, find the one that works best for you and then find others too. IMHO; at a beginner level what you're first trying to learn is to not die, really, that's the whole task in the field, don't die.\n\nApps; the very first one that comes to mind is safety, *'The American Red Cross first Aid\"* app can be the reason you had a great experience, or even the reason you came back. Then the *'SAS survival guide'*, for a great guide for detailed skills. followed by a knots app, both *'Knots 3D'* and *'Animated knots'* are easy to follow and detailed resources. *'Picture this plant'* is really easy to work with, image recognition helps you identify the plants around you by just taking a photo.  *\"iTrack Wildlife'* is a great resource to learn who you're sharing the wilderness with.  \n\nBooks; It's hard to deny the value of the classics. Bradford Angier\u2019s *'How To Stay Alive In The Woods,'* Larry Dean Olsen\u2019s *'Outdoor Survival Skills,'*  John and Geri McPhersen\u2019s *'Wilderness Living And survival Skills,'* and Mors Kochanski\u2019s *'Bushcraft.'* are all invaluable. \n\nFor more contemporary books look and feel aand updated/graded outlooks check out *'The Survival Handbook,'* by Colin Towell, and *'98.6 Degrees,* by Cody Lundin.\n\nOne great thing about books is that you can access basically every outdoor knowledge &amp; survival book for free through a local public library. \n\nMy hierarchy of needs is safety, shelter, water, &amp; food, in that order. Learn how to reliably satisfy these and you're pretty well set up for a lifetime of learning and experiences.",

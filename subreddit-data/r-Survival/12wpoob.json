This teaches you the ability to identify plants as part of broad plant families. \nYou don\u2019t always need to identify specific plants. \n\nNext learn the US Army edible plant test. It was developed in WW2. It\u2019s a very simple but methodical test. \n\nNext if you can find cattails- you really don\u2019t need any other plants. Cattails on their own give you food, insulation, &amp; fire. There are no mimics to the adult cattail. Cattails also means fresh water. \n\nFinally- edible doesn\u2019t mean they taste good. Lots of plants are in our yards are technically edible but they don\u2019t taste as good as corn or wheat or potatoes. Or like acorns require lots of processing to be edible. Thus they fell out of favor.",

Again, do you know anything about how searchand rescue actauly works?  The average SAR is 3 days till located, usually less ..... it\u2019s why we also tell the students certain things:\r  \n\r  \n\\-\tSo - yer out there and lost right?   \r  \n\\-\tYou find water and it\u2019s icky what do you do?  \r  \n\\-\tDrink it or not?  \r  \n\\-\tHell yea, make a basic filter and start slurping \u2013 think about it!!  \r  \n\\-\tWithout any water yer dead in about 3 days anyway so once your found they can treat giardia and tummy bugs but they can't treat dead.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n\r  \nThat\u2019s why these kids and people who wanna play fantasy island have no point here.  The running off for twigs and berries is kinda pointless, sure set traps, maybe make a spruce needle tea and set some trot lines for fish but come on!  You have to make it 1-3 days till the SAR team gets to you \u2026\u2026\r  \n\r  \nStop watching Alone and these other stupid bullshit shows \u2013 waltzing in to the woods deliberately to play survivor man for a week or two days is stupid.\r  \nYes, practice survival skills \u2013 but do it for real \u2013 you don\u2019t have your backpack full of gear with 10 essential items or 15 things you need to know about the \r  \nWoods because what you don\u2019t know will shock you!   \r  \n\r  \n\n\n\r  \nThe problem is \u2013 most of the people now think \u201csurvival\u201d is cool because of TV shows, so they run out to the woods to go play survivor.  Never mind the fact \r  \nthat they don\u2019t actually camp, or backpack, or canoe trip, or hunt, or really do any sort of activity that ACTAULY will put them in the woods to begin with.\r  \n\r  \nThey\u2019re running off to the woods to play survival for survivals sake, in fact it\u2019s becoming a hobby.  I\u2019m gonna take my \u201csurvival pack\u201d and go practice my survival in the woods with it.  If you have a pack FULL OF survival gear that\u2019s not survival \u2013 it\u2019s just camping with less gear then usual.  \n\n\r  \nTRY THIS ......\r  \n\r  \n\\-\tGet your jacket on, put on the belt knife and your pocket kit \u2013 go out to the woods \u2013 take the backpack of gear and don\u2019t touch it or it\u2019s contents  \u2026\u2026.\r  \n\r  \n\\-\tYou lost it when the canoe dumped, or you lost it when the bear chased you, or it fell down a cliff \u2013 IT\u2019 GONE\u2026...\r  \n\r  \n\\-\tNow grab your belt knife and ONLY the stuff you have in your pockets and start making camp because THAT\u2019S what survival is \u2026\u2026.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\n\nNow if you wanna go move to and live in the woods ah la Walden or Grizzley Adams for a year or two, sure.   That\u2019s not survival  - that\u2019s wilderness living, and they not the same  thing at all.  But this forum is for Outdoor Wilderness Survival not outdoor wilderness living where you run away to woods like Chris Knight the Maine Hermit it's also not for the kook prepper's who wanna live to fight the zombies.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s about Outdoor Wilderness Survival \u2013 if fact it should be called Emergency Outdoor Wilderness Survival because if you do get lost it IS a true emergency, it's not a cool fun new hobby.  Go practise sure, but do it properly.\r  \nLastly \u2013 I\u2019m also a miserable bastard who\u2019s bored \u2026\u2026",

I just said ANY shelter, a lean to, natural cave etc is faster upgraded to a good shelter than chopping down trees with a tool you have to have and debark them etc. I think the shelter for itself is nice but survival is about the best possible result with the least possible effort. And that\u2019s clearly not a bark shelter. I have no idea why Someone downs me instead of having a conversation but that\u2019s the times we are living in :/",

    "postText": "This summer I'll be teaching several basic survival courses for 10-12 year olds. I don't have much experience teaching kids of this age, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to teach survival skills at their level.\n\nAny ideas for teaching kids these skills? And any ideas for specific things to teach at that age? \n\nRight now the basic outline of my course includes:\n* Knot-tying/Rope-making\n* Safe water and staying hydrated\n* Food (including edible plants) \n* Fire - safety and several ways to start one\n* Compass/map skills and navigation\n* Shelter - types and how to build\n* Getting found when lost\n* First Aid\n\nLet me know if you think this is too much or if there's anything missing. Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks!",

The kids absolutely hated it. \n\nNo kid wants to be in the middle of the woods looking at a photo card listening to a lecture when everything they need is already around them.\n\nfor example, why look at a card on how to make cordage out of a stinging nettle when you can just find a patch of nettles and make it!  \nIt's more engaging, suits the physical aspect of being outdoors and the kids actually like it!\n\nNeedless to say, I used to take those cards out at the beginnig of a lesson and gave the kids two choices:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. we can sit in a circle and stare at a laminated sheet, or\n2. we can walk through the woods and actually build/make stuff while learning\n\nNo kid ever chose option 1.",

Then we'd quickly go around and ask what they'd found and how/why they'd use it. \n\nThere's so much you can fit into a bushcraft/survival activity. With the longer courses that lasted several days, we'd cover a single topic over a few hours, usually following the rule of three's (3 weeks without food, 3 days without water, 3 hours without shelter etc) We'd start with shelter building on the first day and move on to firelighting, food/water, traps, first aid, navigation, signalling, camouflage and concealment etc.\n\nIf you want a good exercise, build a few fire by friction kits. We used to have pre made fire ploughs and fire bows. The kids could never get an ember (it's hard to do!) but they'd get super competitive with each other trying. Then we'd show them flint and steel, battery and steel wool, potassium permanganate and glycol etc, methods so they could see other ways of making a fire and importantly the fire triangle. Kids can have a hard time with scaling wood from tinder to kindling to fuel and the amount needed for each \"stage\" of a fire\"\n\nI've got a TON of games, excercises and ideas from my instructing days. If you need any help, drop me a DM.",

If nothing else it sounds like they'll have a good time trying. I was also planning on showing them those other fire starting methods but I'll be honest that I've never started a fire with potassium permanganate, they'd definitely get a kick out of that so I'll have to look into it.\n\nI may take you up on your offer, especially with games and activities.

Lefties are more common than I thought when I first started staffing at Boy Scout summer camp and being able to teach left handers left handed tying is soooo much better than trying to get them to tie right handed. I also taught myself to swap hands when chopping with an ax which helped teach that.\n\nactually demonstrating (with class participation) water collection/purification methods is really good, if you're going to have the kids over several days you can rig up a solar still with a bit of plastic bag, hole,  pebble, a collection container, and some green leafy foliage. I'd try to stress that boiling only kills living pathogens, and doesn't do anything for heavy metal contamination.\n\nAs someone mentioned edible plants is a little sketch, but something suuuuper basic like dandelions and cluster fruits (blackberries, raspberries etc) is probably fine, not wild strawberries though, there is a possibility that the look alike is a little toxic.absolutely no mushrooms though haha\n\nwith fire participation will be a huge grab for most kids, and you can have them happily trying to start fires with lenses and bow drills for quite some time. the 9 volt battery and steel wool has always been pretty popular. be sure to cover stop drop and roll and safe ways of putting out fires, that'll be good life information for them.\n\nI'll be honest, it's likely to be hit or miss if your kids will be able to grasp navigation principles, a small orienteering course that they have to solve, maybe make it a race for groups? is a decent way to get them into using the compass properly\n\nsince shelters can take a while to build, I'd throw together a couple of  shelters so I could say \"see, this is a bough lean-to, it's made by\" and quickly cover a few shelters, then have each kid put together a simply tarp shelter.\n\ngetting found, hmm, I always taught \"stay in place as long as it's safe\" maybe tie some of it in with fire making, eg how to make a really smoky fire.\n\nfirst aid, I'd say have them practice bandaging a \"wound\" and splinting a broken long bone, and maybe throw in recognizing the signs of a stroke and the signs of a heart attack while you've got them there. I think I'm supposed to say that I'm an EMT at this point. \n\nI've lectured to that age group for this sort of stuff, and it's not super effective, doing stuff is where it's at, and how you're most likely to get them to be interested.\n\nBUT! if a kid doesn't want to do something, don't make them do it, and shut down any instance of other kids trying to pressure them into doing it.\n\nthe wilderness survival, first aid, and the pioneering merit badge books from the Boy Scouts would probably prove very useful for you.Unless they change it, the pioneering merit badge book was pretty darn cool, one of the few I read for fun haha",

And very good point about not forcing kids by also shutting down pressure from others. Good to remember. I took a bunch of notes from your comment, thanks again. I appreciate you taking time to write it.",

I hope you have a blast with the course!   \nOh! I almost forgot, it's a good idea to prepare a few extra activities incase a days plans either don't work out or you finish everything really early. most of my fellow staffers and I had simple games we could play, but for the life of me, I don't remember any of the specifics.",

Maybe have a goal with the knot tying, make harness, tie up food etc..\n\nTeach them the signs of dehydration, and just because water has a flow doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t get sick\n\nHow to use edible plants, some can be eaten raw, some cooked..\n\nFire, match start, ferro rod, flint, friction .. how to incorporate the wind as well as watching for nearby surroundings.. a good one is a \u201cDakota fire hole\u201d\n\nYou seem to have all of the points well thought out.. also maybe how to dress i.e wool vs cotton\n\nAlso maybe how to track animals, looks for game trails, tracking the sun to keep track of time if lost.. read a Compass , different types of scat\u2026 or even how to find certain bugs to eat lol\n\nThis is all stuff I learned in Girl Scouts and science camp.. MANY years ago but it did stick with me.. making things fun is the game changer.",

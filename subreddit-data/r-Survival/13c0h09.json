I used a fallen cedar. \n- Place a smaller metal can under the air-tight can, inside the ground. I dug a small hole and used a soup can. \n- Light a fire around the air-tight can. I just used the rest of the fallen cedar. Smoke should start coming from the bucket. \n- Wait for the smoke and gas to cease. When you are confident it has stopped, pull the fire away from the bucket. Wait for it to cool. \n\nYou should now have charcoal in the big air-tight can, and tar in the small can underneath. Tar is a natural fire-starter, water-proofer, and stain. It also has been used to treat wounds, but I have zero experience with that.",

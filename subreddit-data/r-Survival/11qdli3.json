But myself and a group are going to Utah this September and I wanted to know if there was anything \"essential\" I should consider for day hiking. I plan on getting something like a 20-30L bag with a hydration pack or something. I've never been out west, so I'm not sure what to expect other than heat and maybe rain occasionally.",

Water\n2. Shoes or socks made to get wet and no blisters\n3. Knowledge of basic first aid, how to use a t shirt and sticks to get a twisted ankle off the mountain or stop a gash from a bad fall.\n4. Noise makers, rattle snakes and bears (occasionally moose) are plentiful but if you talk a lot and loudly they'll get out of your way, if that's not you get a bear bell kind of idea.\n5. Already worn in hiking boots. Something with a high ankle cover. It could save you from a rattlesnake bite and a rolled ankle.\n6. Bear spray (it's also a great keep bad humans away spray as well) \n\nS.U\n1. Water\n2. Water, it's not a joke everywhere in utah is dry, southern utah is extra dry and you will drink a lot.\n3. Good shoes, you likely won't get wet.\n4. Basic first aid, know how to deal with swapping temperature extremes. It can be 80 during the day and then drop to 40 at night.\n\n\nIt's much easier to not actually bump into dangerous wildlife down south, they exist, your just not gona suddenly have something 2 feet in front of you. You'll see each other coming.\n\nLastly download Google offline maps. We love our outdoors and if you get in trouble there will be a closest road with people going down it in September.",

As long as you dont get any water in your ears, eyes, or mouth youll be fine just rinse in the bathroom with waterbottles afterwards. I personally would invest in quick drying non chafing pants just to keep it off my skin and making rinsing off after simpler. You'll want sturdier shoes than chacos imo. Walking through the water is like walking on slick bowling balls, but if you get a good walking stick Chacos work fine. I used neoprene hiking boots cause I got some for free last time I went, my brother used chacos and merino wool socks and he was just as fine as I was.\nEven in September after dark it can get cold in those canyons though. Bring something that can keep you warm enough to not die if you say can't make it back out till 3 am, but you don't need to be that bubble wrap kid on Christmas Story if you take my meaning.\n\nIt's one of those hikes where everyone's done it in every set up you can think of. Nothing to be scared of, but people have died when they make the wrong decisons so be smart.\n\nThe best plan you can have is do your big hikes anywhere there real early in the morning, you'll avoid big crowds and if something does unfortunately go wrong you have plenty of extra day time to get safe before dark. Then as sunset comes find a good relaxing spot to get some great photos and be ready for the amazing stars that follow (again blm land) that night.",

Weather changes quick  and it helps to be able to strip down to just a tank top and have a solid thermal to warm up in, especially in canyons shit gets cold quick.  Bring a hat and sunglasses too protect yourself from that sun.  Reapply sunblock and plan for that too based on how long you're gonna be out there.  Make sure you've got breathable hiking shoes or boots.\n\nFirst aid kit is always needed, but plan for sunburns and abrasions, sometimes the sun can heat rocks so much they can burn you.

And if you are feeling truly fucked and have been lost for a few days, a gun and a good shot can get you some food quickly when the opportunity arrises. A gun is just a tool, many ways of utilizing it.\n\nNaturally, check your state laws, permit requirements, county ordinances, and trail rules.

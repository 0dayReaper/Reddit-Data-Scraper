(He was Russian) He prefaced the act with \u201cif go down, I have gun.\u201d He then proceeds to stall the plane high up, then we start diving at large open tundra. I see a couple big brown objects standing out against the green landscape. As we get closer the brown objects turn into a bear with its cubs. Headed straight for the group our pilot pulls up feet above the bears.(was probably much higher lol) But damn did that Russian have some balls. Oh and mind that the whole time this was going on the pilot was laughing. I on the other hand was silent and very nervous.",

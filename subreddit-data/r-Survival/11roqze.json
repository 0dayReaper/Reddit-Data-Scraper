Easy to strike, and when the flint wears down simply tighten the screw to increase friction. Flame extends when you tip it up so it can light pipes and fires more easily. Easily refillable. Some are transparent to check gas levels. You can burn smiley faces into things if you need to leave a subtle but artificial mark somewhere. \nCheap reliable and easily available. I have a one in my car that is more than 20 years old that still works. Just refill and replace the flint as needed. It cost a quid.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, as things are warming up now and we will soon have access to the mountains, camping, etc, what would you say are the top 10 survival skills to have in case of a societal collapse, or foreign invasion, or EMP attack etc. Whatever the cause for the need to survive, what skills would you say are the most necessary?personally I know how to hunt, I can start a fire with flint and steel or mag rod, bow drill, batteries etc. I know some knots, some medical, fishing, hunting, could do better in shelter building, and medical. I feel like sometimes we get a bit focused on certain things and neglect other important aspects of survival. So, what would you say are the top ten skills we all should know? I am ready to break out of winter, get into the hills on weekends and start practicing.",

We have the three types of heat transfer, conduction (generally only applicable when laying down, where a thermal barrier should be used between you and the ground), radiant (warmed by fire, cooled by heat loss to the atmosphere), and convection (warmed by shelter or layers/jackets, etc. and/or a shelter, cooled by passing air/wind). Conduction is generally the least concerning unless you are laying on the ground, where the earth acts as a giant heat sink. So we\u2019re left with radiation and convection, though it seems radiation gets the most attention in survival guides. Convection is an extremely efficient method of year transfer and should be heavily considered, as the above comment suggests. Just a thought.",

Everyone else there was vegetarian, but I can\u2019t stand veggies, so I never ate the veggies grown on the property (which I was heavily criticized and ostracized for). Instead, I trapped rabbits and squirrels, sometimes got some fresh roadkill, and had a beef with the local turkeys for not getting in my belly without a coyote-and-roadrunner style struggle. It\u2019s plenty to survive off of for someone my size until the middle of winter, and everyone else on the commune fled south because it definitely wouldn\u2019t have been enough for those giants, who I was honestly glad to see go, but I still survived the winter there by occasionally eating dog food when the beans ran out. I lost 40 pounds that year, and I used to be chunky so I consider that a net gain. I think more people should try living in the mountains alone for a while. Not because it\u2019s fun (it\u2019s not), but because it\u2019s difficult, and having gone through that as well as homelessness in the city as a small woman, hitchhiking, trainhopping, and other dangerous lifestyles successfully gives me a strange sense that I could survive anything. Even if society fell and the nation were on fire, I\u2019d be okay. For some reason I\u2019m a lot less anxious now",

However, the single most important survival skill, and one that almost no one talks about (especially the broey lone-wolf keyboard survivalists), is having a tight-knit and likeminded community of people thriving with you. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors (and those who are still barely holding on to traditional lifeways in the modern world) didn't go at it alone. They knew (and still know) that the very best safety net that maximizes survival is other people to support you (and for you to support).  \n\n\nOutside of that, if you're determined to try and survive solo, shelter is the absolute biggest priority. Most people in modern survival scenarios die from exposure, not hunger, thirst, or predation. Focus on crafting shelters, then on securing a water source (ice may be a good option in the Rockies in various parts of the year, as it is 90% water and 10% air, as contrasted to snow, which is 90% air and 10% water), then on making fire, and finally on finding food. In my rewilding journey, I've prioritized learning skills related to each of those categories in that order. Cheers!",

Little towns where each person had a job like bakers and blacksmiths and stuff. I was laughed at.\n\nLone wolves aren\u2019t going to survive long. Humans need certain vitamins and minerals. We can\u2019t get all we need eating animals and berries. We need things like spinach and wheat and stuff. \n\nSo if you have a little farm community, you can have folks that farm and take care of animals and all the different jobs even nurses and doctors. One person can\u2019t stockpile a ton of stuff and expect to live for the next thirty years in a shack in the Rockies. \n\nEspecially because there\u2019s other survivors. Most animal populations near cities are going to be decimated. Even people\u2019s pet poodles will be eaten. After a few months, the city folks who survived have now raided all the grocery stores and killed all the squirrels they could catch. They\u2019re going to be heading your way next. If you already have a strong and tight knit community, you\u2019ll hopefully be able to protect yourselves from raiders. But you\u2019ll want a more dirt rich area than the Rockies and something a bit away from big cities like middle of kansas.",

When climbing over rocks and maneuvering around the mountains, keep three points of contact with whatever you are maneuvering, to reduce your risk of falling. \n\n3. Doesnt hurt to find a cave that is fairly close to a spring. In the event of an apocolyptic event, it might be much harder to get to the site you wanted, than you have planned, and its easy to get hurt in all that commotion, so you should have a plan B, in case you need a safe place to go to heal up..\n\n4. All brown bears are technically grizzly bears that live in a different region. They will fucking kill you. Watch out, and carry a powerful firearm. \n\n5. Dont panic. But, if you do start panicking, try doing long and drawn out deep breathing.. 4 seconds in, hold 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds. It is a natural calming technique used by the SEALS. \n\n6. If you get lonely, start renaming stars after the people you love. Then you will always have someone to talk to, besides God. \n\n7. Take care of your feet. Try to keep them dry and clean..\n\n8. Have some way to tether your tools to your belt. Its easier to drop a knife, and not feel panicked to try to catch it, than to cut yourself or fall, trying to catch a dropped item. \n\n9. Never underestimate the power of rock wall gardening.. \n\n10. You might encounter loose poultry/ livestock. Learn animal husbandry, and adapt your life to maintaining theirs. \n\n11. Never take a poop or a pee within 500 feet of a water source, and always try to do it downstream. \n\n12. Be prepared to migrate. Different areas will have more optimal opportunities, depending on the time of the year. You wont eat well in the Rockies between November and March.",

Again no offense intended. I like a gung ho attitude, its just used too often by \"heros\" who made the papers the same week of their funerals. \n\nSurvival is always going to be about surviving.",

This sub is for shorter term survival, not after societal collapse. Stay alive and be rescued or rescue yourself. Humans are dependent on other humans. Unless you are already well established off-grid, you aren't going to wander out there and survive for long. You can't fish and hunt all you need, and doing even that in the mountains in winter.... the Native Americans knew better, you should too. Maybe check out bushcraft or offgrid living stuff, but they require goods too. Got a pack mule or two?",

And he was living in a place that was absolutely overrun with wildlife. He had all the natural resources free for the taking in unlimited quantities. Want to built a cabin? Chop down some trees and build away.\n\nEventually you are gonna run out of something: beans, bullets, bandaids, whatever. Or you will get old and sick, or injure yourself. Thinking you are going to go it alone is a fool's errand. The guy in Alaska eventually could not make it on his own and had to return to society when he was like 80 years old. He was an absolute master at it, and he didn't make it for his entire life.\n\nIn the eventualities that OP discussed, you'd be trying to fend off other people trying to do the same thing, meanwhile they are using up all the natural resources too. Squirrel meat is going to become mighty scarce.",

If you have a massive hemorrhage that warrants a TQ and you have to improvise there's a pretty good chance you'll bleed out. There are other reasons to get a proper TQ, such as being able to properly stage one rapidly deploy one - just know that you need the real thing.\n\nIf you're looking into this, check out stop the bleed classes for training on basic response to major bleeds and trauma.",

If you have a buried shipping container for a garage that's 5ft under you're safe and most small electronics and such have enough shielding in them already that if one happens your optics, vehicle, phone, etc won't be going down and the damage cause by an EMP is temporary along with immediately incurring the bottomless wrath of the military industrial complex. Biggest threat is just a societal collapse again and for that a shelter in place and defend what you got is a better option than running to the mountains. If you're worried about the government start digging caves in the mountain.",

Matches and lighters won\u2019t have gone anywhere in the event of a foreign invasion or EMP event, and neither will buildings cease to exist. It would probably be a waste of energy and resources to build a shelter when there\u2019s an entire ghost town for you to hide out in.\n\nSolo survival is not really something that will be a sustainable long term plan for most people, so creating a community and fitting into it is of the utmost importance.",

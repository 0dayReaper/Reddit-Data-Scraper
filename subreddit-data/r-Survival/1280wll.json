But a well set trap is almost a sure thing if you've studied the target animal and know its habits.\n\nSince you need to get a license to do it anyway, it's also not a bad side gig. Basically no matter where you live in the USA there is a demand for licensed nuisance wildlife trapping, which is necessary for the benefit and safety of animals and humans... and good survival practice.",

There is a class for almost every skill you may need including basket weaving. They usually charge something but it sounds like you could use the help. Just google \u201csurvival classes\u201d and \u201csurvival schools\u201d.",

They all come with a cylinder bore / no choke, so even if you do manage to squeeze off an accurate shot, getting a solid hit on small game with shot past about 25 yards gets very iffy. Wing shooting is practically a joke.\n\nLets be real here: practically speaking, a Shockwave is a range toy or impractical self defense option.\n\nMinishells have even worse ballistics (low velocity and low shot or slug payload) than normal shotshells.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I like going to the range with terrible awkward guns like my Shockwave as much as the next guy, but it would *never* be my recommendation for a survival gun unless there was literally no other choice.",

To go out for a serious amount of time without having the fundamentals down is dangerous and inadvisable.\n\nAll of these skills that people are listing take time to get good at, they take practice. If you were proficient in several and wanted to expand your knowledge into other areas that would be one thing, but it sounds like you're starting at the basics in *every* skill.\n\nMight I recommend something a little less intense, perhaps two weeks, and you bring emergency rations and water and comms incase you get into trouble. Don't dip into your emergency stockpile unless you need to, or maybe even just supplement what you can gather, hunt, angle etc. with other supplies you rucked in.",

            "comment": "Have you ever gone camping before? I'd start off going on a few camping trips to help figure out what you need gear wise.  Eventually start going on backpacking trips in the Backcountry and figuring out what gear you need and prefer for that.  You'll likely learn a lot of stuff you probably wouldn't think of during these steps like water purification, fire making, cooking and shitting outside, etc.  Depending on how you plan on surviving, figure out which gear you can replace with things you can make in the woods.\nHave you ever gone fishing before?  Do you know how to gut and clean a fish?  Fishing, imo, is one of the easiest ways to feed yourself and you're typically allowed to do it year round unlike hunting (You'll still want to respect local laws and regulations since you aren't going to be in a true survival situation).  There's actually a lot more to fishing than throwing a worm and line out into the water, like knowing your targeted species habits, where they might be, what they like to eat, when are they active, etc. It's an entire subject to research and practice.  Trapping an hunting are similarly different areas to look into and practice.\nForaging for wild edibles isn't that great for calories in most cases, but this is where you would be getting the majority of your vitamins.  Plus, if you ever get a sweet tooth, that's where berry knowledge would come into play lol.  You have to be very careful and be 100% certain that your identification of a wild plant or mushroom is correct before you eat it because a lot of things will kill you.  Learning to feed yourself is probably the longest skill to take to develop and when talking about true survival situations, is actually the least necessary as most people get rescued before they would be actually starving.  It's necessary to know if you are intentionally putting yourself in a long term survival situation.   I would spend at least 2 years regularly studying foraging, fishing, hunting etc before you attempt this, and even then I would have some kind of back up. Oh, and you'll need to know how to preserve this stuff too.  If you can't preserve the food you hunt and gather then you can't build up a food store. If you can't build up a food store then you aren't going to be surviving for long in the winter months if you plan on doing any of this in the winter.  \nUnfortunately this is all a big undertaking that will take some time, but I think you will find some peace in learning all of this if.  Remember, you never want to actually be in a survival situation.  The goal is to be prepared with the knowledge and skills to never be in one to begin with.",

            "comment": "Your question is impossible to answer. Try asking, \"What are the MOST important skills to learn?\". It would take a small library of books and the combined experience of everyone that has replied to your post to answer your question. If you think like you're living 200-300 years ago, there are SO MANY skills that people would specialize in something - blacksmith, farmer, doctor, etc. \n\nPersonally, I feel the best survival skill you need RIGHT NOW is to have a credit card or semi-fat wallet. \n1. Buy books. Do NOT rely on apps or ebooks. You should have a few survival books that will not evaporate, with an EMP. Look for How To books, Plant ID, First Aid, Canning/Food Preservation, etc. \nCheck out your local Scout Shop. Pick up a Scout Handbook and a few Merit Badge books on Camping and Wilderness Survival, Plant Study, etc.\n2. Buy quality gear. You don't need to buy the most expensive things, but look for the best ratings. In a backwoods environment, if a tool breaks, you can't run to Lowes for a new one. \n3. Weapons are a topic in themselves, so here are my opinions.  \n     In survival mode, the fixed blade is king, but you should have a folding knife as a backup. Again, buy the best quality you can afford. \n   GUN DISCLAIMER: Just so I don't get beat up by what I'm about to say.... this is only my thoughts on guns, so folks, please take it as just that. \n     Well, here it goes... I'm not a big fan of ARs for survival. Yes, I said it. Sorry, ya'll. I believe in keeping it simple. As for rifles, bolt action is most accurate. Accuracy will help eliminate animal torture (kill, don't just wound), meat and hide damage, and save you ammo for future hunts. Although single and double barrel shotguns are simple, I've had the same Mossberg pump 12 gauge for 35 years, without needing repaired. I'd recommend either Mossberg or Remington (they're Ford vs. Chevy, so ya'll please see the disclaimer. LOL).\n     Bows are better for stealth purposes (and ammo usage). I'm not an archery guy, so I'll leave it at that.\n4. Find time to practice what you've learned. Build a shelter, then live it it for a weekend or longer (even if it's in your backyard). Grow a garden, then use canning to preserve what you've grown (best corn ive EVER eaten was canned by a little ole lady). Go to the gun or archery range and learn your weapons. \n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, sorry if this isn\u2019t on topic. I\u2019m going to go camping on an island for 2 nights, and planned on catching a crab (legally with license and open regulations). Morality of catching the crab aside, the only issue I have is whether using a portable stove (campfires banned) like this would be sufficient to cook a 11.5 cm (rock crab) or 16.5 cm dungeness. I\u2019ll bring a pot that can fit one of course. Does anyone have experience or advice, or how much extra time needed to cook it in a small stove? Thanks in advance.",

If you are using a tiny stove with solid fuel pellets you'll probably need some extra pellets but a stove that runs off pressurized butane (if temperatures are above freezing) or white gas will be fine. A stove in a can probably won't be hot enough.\n\nBring a pot of water, ideally salt water to a boil. \n\nWhile you're waiting, take the crab so it's facing away from you, shell up and grab each side of the legs in one hand. Swing it down firmly so it's \"chin\" hits something solid and the top of the shell will pop off. Cut it in half (left and right) with a knife and swish it around in clean water, using your hand to brush off the guts. Boil for 15-20 minutes depending on size. The two halves should fit in a 10\" pot.\n\nFor a more flavorful survival experience, cook the crab whole for 20 minutes. Open it upside down and the top of the shell will be filled with a rich buttery liquid you can drink. Check for warnings about consuming crab hepatopancreas in your area before doing this as it can be contaminated in some places.\n\nThis is all assuming dungeness or red rock  crabs.",

Rock crabs for some reason don't taste nearly as good if they're boiled, but are almost equal to dungeness if they're just steamed and not boiled. Boiling would be more like 4 minutes. \n\nLots of videos online for how to clean them. It helps to let them cool for 10 minutes before cleaning or it's hot as hell when you try to pull out the guts.",

You can technically char wood, grass, etc. But cloth is definitely the most effective. \n\nIf you're taking about lighting things with the ice, it's just a naturally occurring fresnel lens and will depend on how bright it is outside, the convex shape of the ice, and the effectiveness of your tinder - fresnel lenses can be difficult to light with if it's not bright as hell outside or if you don't have good tinder, like char-cloth",

They're great for saving fuel because you don't need to get the water to boiling and you don't need a thermometer.\n\nThe difference between pasteurization and sterilization isn't terribly important if you're drinking the water right away. If the water is just pasteurized, all living organisms are killed but spores could still survive, so you shouldn't store that water long-term - drink it as soon as it's cool enough to, or within a day or so.",

If it's pale pink after half an hour it is fine, pour some vitamin c in to clear the solution and you are fine to drink it. (don't use for everyday drinking)",

Bleach wants to be made a whole or fully saturated molecule and will steal the ions of others nearby to do so, which is why it destroys the cell membranes and kills bacteria. In it's enclosed space, it does this to itself, just far less quick, until they all become saturated and are different compounds.",

Boiling does kill the living things that would make you sick and make make water safe to drink from a biological standpoint... but doesn't do anything for dissolved solids.

Can't remember if that works with heavy metals.\n\nFiltering with activated charcoal and a small enough Filtering medium removes bad things from the water larger than water molecules. This can include metals and biological elements if the filter is advanced enough.\n\nDistillation...  physically turning the water to vapor (steam) which leaves behind solids which condenses back into clean water at the end of the process. This leaves behind anything that doesn't have below or near the the same boiling point as water. (This is why distilled water is used with medical devices to aide breathing like CPAP machines.) Vapor distillation does remove minerals so the water will be pretty \"flat\" or bland tasting. This could be fixed by adding a hydration powder or flavoring.",

Let me point out that this is a wilderness survival sub, not a doom-prepper, post-apocalypse kind of thing. The chances of stumbling upon a body of brack water in the actual wilderness that just so happens to be polluted with water-solvent chemicals and heavy metals and pesticides are so slim that they may as well be zero.\n\n1. Filter the water through the finest piece of cloth you have.\n\n2. Bring it to a boil.\n\n3. Filter it a second time through the charcoal from the fire you made in step 2. Use a separate cloth to filter out coal and ash from the water.\n\nThese are steps you can take in any reasonable survival situation almost regardless of gear. Given that the weather permits it, etc. It won't be *guaranteed* safe, but you will be many orders of magnitude safer than if you hadn't done these things, and it most certainly does count as \"good enough\" in a survival situation.\n\nIf you want to plan for this kind of situation when you're putting your kit together, get a Sawyer Mini or a LifeStraw or some equivalent. Requires no fire or prep and will make any natural body of water safe to drink (within some miniscule level of tolerance).",

            "comment": "Water is capable of absorbing / dissolving almost anything it touches. That unusual capability is part of why nearly all life needs water to survive. Unfortunately it also means if the water has touched basically anything harmful, then teh water is no-longer safe to drink.\n\nThe only \"safe\" water is water that has been tested in a lab. Your city does that continuously with the water it provides.\n\nOtherwise, you can significantly reduce your risks by choosing flowing water (because it probably fell from the sky or was filtered through ground relatively recently).\n\nAnd you can reduce the risk even further by filtering and/or boiling it yourself immediately before drinking. That won't remove the risk entirely though.\n\nSome things are quite difficult to remove. Salt for example \u2014 which is why we don't generally drink seawater... though it can be done with a bit of effort.\n\nPerfectly sterile water (distilled water) isn't great either by the way. It strips your body of important nutrients as it passes through. You can drink it as long as you're eating all of those nutrients regularly but in a survival situation you probably are not eating a balanced diet. So avoid distilling your water - it will satisfy your thirst right now (and keep you alive) but it will probably make you sick in the medium term (which could kill you).\n\nThe other thing the city does is add chlorine to the water - a chemical that is harmless to humans in low quantities and kills pretty much all bacteria. The \"aerator\" built into your kitchen tap also evaporates nearly all of it instantly and heating the water up (coffee, cooking, etc) definitely removes all of it so you actually aren't drinking most of the chlorine the city puts in the water. You could add chlorine to your survival kit, but it's only safe in low quantities and if it's too low it won't kill the organisms.\n\nChlorine water treatment is a relatively recent technology. Prior to that large sand filters were the main method of purifying city water. This works very well in theory, but in practice contaminants would be absorbed after the water is filtered but before it gets to your home. This method is a lot more practical in a survival situation, where you can easily drink the water immediately after it's filtered without it touching anything dangerous. It's good to know how these work as a last resort, since basically all you need is dirt to make a sand filter (you just need to clean the dirt to make it into sand). Once setup these are much less work than a fire to boil water, though in a cold climate you might have a fire anyway.",

I would not recommend using material from cheap canvas drop-cloths such as the ones sold in many hardware stores)\n\nOnce I have pre-filtered the turbid water, I will either mechanically filter (With the Sawyer system shown in the images below) the semi-clean water or I will bring it to a rolling boil over a small fire so as to render it potable.\n\nUsing the pre-filter extends the life of the mechanical filter and helps to prevent clogging\n\n\nHere are some images of my filter set-up: https://imgur.com/a/BFpL7ZQ",

Boil it and pray there's not too many parasites in it...\n\nI might be biased, since I grew up around pretty clean water. I've got no issues just drinking straight from a lake or moving river.

Field sharpening is straightforward if you go with a carbon steel blade (takes a sharpening easily). Mora's are very inexpensive for the quality of the product.\n\nI know nothing of the other option, apologies. It's a pretty knife, but I don't care much about how photogenic my knives are.",

I say that with a caveat because I bought them for the purpose of making them feel totally finished by either doing acid etching and blueing on the blades or finishing the wood handles to an exceptional level. They are extremely easy to properly finish or customize and the end result is a knife of reasonable quality that feels special because you\u2019ve made it your own. \n\nI\u2019ve also owned a couple of Mora knives and have been impressed with their blades (only because of the low prices) but the handles have always left me feeling like they are toys and cheaply built where the handles are concerned. I have literally returned both to Amazon the very next day. One was a Garberg that I was so excited to get but felt more let down than any knife our hade I have ever made. \n\nSeveral of the BPS knives I own are almost complete\ndesign rip offs of the Mora\u2019s and the blades are nearly identical in terms of shape and grind. They just feel nicer and more quality with their wood handles as opposed to the truly cheap feeling injection molded plastic handles of the Mora knives. \n\nI hope this helps. The truth is, both the Mora and BPS knives are so inexpensive, there is really no reason you couldn\u2019t have both. \n\nEnjoy what ever direction you decide to go!",

Bps are decent knives but the grip is awkward for my hobbit hands and the wood gets slick easily.",

It was my first \"bushcraft\" knife, and I fell completely in love - so much so that I decided to get their premium model mora garberg.   And I got quite disappointed. It just didn't do the camp tasks as well as the companion. The ONLY reason it is not my primary knife is its esthetics - it is not that \"sexy\".\n\nBut a few premium and custom knifes later I often end up using the mora companion, that my friend brings  when we are out and about. All the while my sexy knife is just hanging from my belt.",

If you ever depend on having your knife with you, then it should be tethered - I don't tether my knife often but I'd never buy a knife that cannot be tethered. The mora is a little on the small side too.\n\nHaving said that, the BPS is even worse... I don't particularly like the handle or the sheath and that fire starter belongs in the bin. They're trying to make a pretty but functional knife and they ended up with an ugly knife that isn't very functional (e.g. leather and carbon steel do not mix well).\n\nThe BPS looks like a knife designed for impulse purchases and I'd bet almost everyone who buys one regrets it later.\n\nIf you must pick between the two, get the Mora and drill a tether hole in the handle.\n\nBut really I recommend an ESSE-4, with SS35VN steel. \n\nSS35VN is a little fragile, so don't be too rough with it (use an axe or machete for your rough work), but what it lacks in durability it makes up for by being stainless which I prefer especially for food prep.",

You pay a monthly fee to have the ability to send a certain amount of texts (you can text more but pay for them I believe) it also will make your location visible to people you specify, as well as act as an SOS beacon in case you really find yourself in a pickle. If you put out the SOS signal, it goes to a center which will then figure out who's responsibility it is to come get you, and they will also inform whomever you've specified as an emergency contact. It gives you the ability to communicate with friends/family in the backcountry, as well as the ability to communicate with SAR in the event of an emergency. Pretty straightforward, and as long as you can see the sky, it will be mostly dependable. There is no emergency option that works 100% of the time, I believe a Garmin or Spot device would be the best choice in your situation.\n\nEveryone is recommending a radio, and they are great, but they are incredibly limited in range, especially in the backcountry. You need to have line of sight to whomever you are trying to speak with, or a repeater. Then you need to know what frequencies to communicate on. Not to mention all the laws surrounding broadcasting. Radios are excellent tools, but will require more education than using an InReach or similar device.",

You\u2019ll be much better prepared to fine-tune or repair any radio you end up with.\n\nEdit: having the license will also allow you to *legally* train using that radio.\n\nYet another edit: Radios exist that will cover HAM, GMRS, as well as FRS frequencies while also functioning as an FM radio and a weather radio. While this is great functionality to have in an emergency, think twice about trusting any of your SHTF kit to Baofeng quality control. Some of their products are great, some are comically bad.",

Even on FRS frequencies most of the Baofengs don't meet the FCC requirements for FRS (nondetachable antenna and max 5W). The justification for having them is if in a life or death emergency scenario it is legal to transmit using any means available on any frequency. People will just use them anyway because they're not causing too much interference most of the time because of their relatively low power.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is most handhelds, especially Baofengs which are low end hardware, aren't capable of transmitting very far, so unless your friends/family are just a few miles away at the most you're not going to be able to reach them. You may need to go with a mobile or base station and a larger antenna which will all help you transmit dozens/hundreds/even thousands of miles. Which you'd definitely want your license if you do that.",

Not that it's unheard of mind you. I can regularly hit one particular UHF repeater from inside my house with my 8W handheld from 68 miles (both on facing peaks) and can hit the local DMR repeater (18 miles away) on only 4W. That being said, SHTF scenario, don't rely on repeaters being operational for more than 72hrs in an actual event. Start looking at either some way to \"really\" get your antennas as high as possible. Ed Fong (out of CA makes some awesome dual-band base type antennas for very reasonable prices, look him up on eBay) and Yeasu makes a pretty reliable handheld (right around $90 typically) FT-65R. And try to get the lowest loss cable you can find (between the radio and the antenna)",

Yaesu (ft-4xr/ft-65r, vx-6r), Kenwood (very good but also too expensive probably), maybe Alinco, Anytone. \n\n....but beforehand I'd try good old CB radio, which in this terrain might actually work even better. Can't recommend HT CB radio, but I guess Uniden or Alan should have some?\n\nCB doesn't need the licence and should carry enough power.\n\nIf CB doesn't work, I'd consider GMRS (in the US where you presumably live), but that offers less power in handheld, as far as I remember, and has very limited channels/capabilities. The upside is you just purchase the licence and that's it. And it has fixed channels which makes it very easy to operate.\n\nThen there's ham radio-the problem with this one is that while it's most flexible, it's also getting very complicated as long as you want to use it beyond the channels someone programs into your radio. It absolutely CAN be used with channels only (which correspond to the specific frequencies on the band plan) but that's like buying a yacht and only keeping it in the port and sleeping in the tent on the upper deck. Sure, you can do it.\n\nAnd then there's elephant in the room, licencing-you cannot legally use ham radio without the licence otherwise than in under direct, imminent threat to life. Sure you can ignore it but is it worth it? It depends on whether you're planning on using it only with the few folks during walks, or whether you're actually planning to using the medium to the fullest. \n\nThe thing with licencing is also that to pass the (relatively easy) exams you'll gain the knowledge that will help you exploit the capabilities of the hardware available and circumstances you're in, so, you can achieve your goals easier (and who knows, maybe at some point you'll hear unexpected transmission from the Hawaii or Spain?)... and you can practice with other people if you'd like (I don't, I have other bits of the hobby to keep me occupied). \n\nIf you decide to go the ham route though, I'd recommend either getting a couple of hams and walk with them in these hills so you can see whether it's viable, or get the cheap, barely adequate but good enough for this-Baofeng UV-5B for example, because you can get cheap pair to play with these. Once you know it works for you, get the better radios, get your licence, park your car with the crossband repeater on the hill, and suddenly enjoy 30 mile range.",

That'd be down to the lawyers to check it in court (honestly I doubt anyone would be prosecuted, what I mean is that law seems to be vague), but I don't thinks impeding hurricane or rising river level threatening to cut off the community would qualify.\n\nHiker with a broken leg-by all means. Damaged car in the blizzard on the forest road? Sure.\n\nWould the person injured know how to operate it when in stress, cold and/or pain?\n\nDoubt it. But if someone really, really os bent on purchasing Ham radio, programming it and never using until the emergency.... they're about to discover the battery is almost discharged, and the radio is in the VFO mode... which would be normally great, but not for someone not knowing their NFM from DCS.\n\nUsing radio spectrum is a skill. The more complex tool you apply to it, the more skill is needed. The community should promote getting licenced by the people looking seriously into survival simply because it increases the survival chances (of everyone else-what if they hear call for help one day? They won't if they're not used to use of the radio on the calling frequencies).\n\nWhat I see, however, is the bizarre rejection of the facts and support to the idea that it's somehow *better* not to learn, not to train. Why?",

Actually I was set up to do the technicians test but covid intervened In the meantime I acquired a couple of GMRS radios and license. I'm very happy with their performance for local communication and will likely not go sny further into HAM. GMRS is dead simple, I can hand one to someone and say \"push to talk\" and we're off. I have one with lots of buttons but rarely use them. I may get one of the higher powered base units someday.\n\nI have acquired several radios over my years, SW, Ham, tiny am/fm, even CB. Counting NOAA I have lots of ways to get outside or very local info - still lots of CBs out there.",

I personally carry a Yaesu FT-60 and have repeaters programmed in for spots I regularly go along with a large magnetic mount antenna in the car. I would highly recommend going and getting your ham radio license. Not only will you gain access to a helpful community that is eager to help your skills progress along the way, you will gain a basic understanding of how radios work in order to make a more informed decision. Radios aren't magic and both terrain and weather affect the distance they can travel in a given situation in a given direction.\n\nYou can have great gear and end up completely screwed because you don't know how to use it. The more knowledge you have, the more you appreciate good gear and the less you need a lot of fancy equipment. There are some very expensive \"push button\" solutions for different situations out there that are extremely unnecessary.\n\nCould you clarify what you mean by a \"survival situation?\" What I would recommend you learning and purchasing would vary hugely based on the part of the US you live in, where you travel to and what kinds of activities you're doing as well as the specific risks you're looking to mitigate. I keep different supplies in the car and on my person based on the season and location and activities. It's very situational. I like staying comfortable and keeping my family comfortable, too.",

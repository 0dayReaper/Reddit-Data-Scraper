    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe and my friend are looking for cold weather gear that's water proof while offering insulation for here up in the Pacific Northwest ( Oregon, WA) We were looking at gear and found a Hungarian military surplus Parka with suspenders trousers. Our plan is to use these and layer up. I was wondering if anyone thinks these would be good for our usage? ( Hunting, shooting in cold/rainy weather) We looked at gear by Sitka but it's a bit more than we'd like to spend.\n\n[https://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/hungarian-military-surplus-waterproof-scentproof-2-piece-camo-set-new?a=2224555](https://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/hungarian-military-surplus-waterproof-scentproof-2-piece-camo-set-new?a=2224555)",

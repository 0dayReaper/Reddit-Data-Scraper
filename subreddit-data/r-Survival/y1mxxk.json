You get fire starters of a size that is way more usable.  Hell, you can even cut each cell into quarters once the wax sets and still use them as effective fire starters.",

When we get four or five of them, I melt the wax and pour it over the dryer lint I have put into cardboard egg cartons. I cut or tear the 12 sections out of the carton and end up with 12 fire starters per carton. They burn for several minutes, which is long enough to start a fire.

Absolutely love them since they're small, easy to make, and start a fire really well.\n\nA pack of 200 tea light candles is super cheap. I cut the bottom of a beer can to melt it in, and made a hacky burner out of a tuna can - just something to hold the can above a burning tea light. \n\nCut up some of the tea light's wax and put it into the can, melt it with one of the tea lights under it. takes a moment but once it's going its easy to add more. Then just dip the cosmetic pads into it. Leave a bit of the pad dry - this will easily light with a fire steel, and once the cotton is burning it'll melt and start wicking the wax.\n\nNote: do this in well ventilated area. I feel heating up a beer can is not healthy if done indoors. You might also look very suspicious when melting things with tealights inside a cut up can.\n\nalso, OP thanks for the post, seems like a good way to use sawdust. Surely packs some more power than the cotton pads, depending on the conditions you're trying to make a fire it sure will come in handy.",

    "postText": "Hello! First poster here I\u2019ve been into survival and general outdoorsmanship, conservation,foraging, etc and have camped plenty of times when I lived in Mexico this was on the beach where few ticks were found. Recently I\u2019ve gotten out of a giant depression slump by hiking and backpacking with my husky Della. After our daily hike we come back and with this particularly wet spring the tall grass has been overrun with ticks. Every 5-10 paces I\u2019ll stop and shake off 4-5 ticks on myself. I\u2019ve heard of many solutions to keep ticks away and tried many and none have worked. I take Lyme desease seriously ever since I met an amputee that suffered from Lyme desease. My questions are: \n1. Is Lyme desease as bad as people say in the context of a survival situation? \n2. What are your strategies to keep the nasty bastards at bay?\n\nP.S i take every precaution I can under the sun for Della with tick collars and the anti tick drops.",

It isn't a consideration for everyone but it's worth keeping in mind that it is a blanket insecticide, it doesn't repel ticks, it kills them. This goes for all the other insects that you come into contact with as well.\n\nI know Lyme and TBE are both potentially very serious but it seems to me like most of us are going out into nature because we enjoy it, we love it, and we get something valuable back from it.\nTo me it seems a pity to do that while wrapped in a little bubble of insecticide and leaving a trail of dead spiders, bees and butterflies behind you. Insects around the world (except ticks ironically) are in serious trouble at the moment and I don't like to think of my hobby being a part of that problem.\n\nI like to be able to stop and rescue bugs from the trail or enjoy the moment that butterfly lands on me without worrying that I'm going to kill them juts by being close to them.\n\nYou can use repellent instead. Deet works but has its own set of issues for nature and satitidin seems pretty good based on my more limited experience.\n\nLyme doesn't transmit before 24-36 hours so check regularly, and watch for rashes. I know there is some evidence that the time scales might be shorter but I go with the general consensus as I'm not a scientist.\nAs for TBE, there is a vaccine that is something like 98% effective.\nAnd in the end, while both diseases can be incredibly bad news, they usually aren't. I know loads of people who have had Lyme and made a full recovery.\n\nThis really isn't a rant against permethrin use, it is just my personal opinion and an angle that some people find useful.\nYou do what is best for you, stay safe and have fun \ud83d\ude0a",

It's the only insect spray for your skin that works as well as DEET (most other things barely work at all), but it is way less harsh of a chemical. DEET melts plastic and rubber, and makes your lips go kind of numb if you get it on them. It's kind of nasty stuff. But the lemon eucalyptus stuff is just plant oil. It even smells really nice - everyone likes it. The little bottles suck for spraying it though, so I mix it 50/50 with 50% alcohol and put it in a glass spray bottle - that makes it way easier to spread quickly and evenly. It only works where you spray it though. If you don't spray it on your arms, insects will bite your arms. It's not good enough to just smell like it - you have to cover all your exposed skin with it. But it works great.\n\nAlso works great on dogs. I just spray mine down and it keeps most all the ticks off of her and mosquitos don't bother her either.

My parents still live in that house, and my parents, my dog, and I have all gotten lyme disease at one point in our lives.  I also know several other people who have had it too.  As for the dog, she got some medication and was fine, but Lyme doesn't usually affect dogs as badly as humans.  Dog is now vaccinated against Lyme disease.  For the humans I know who have had it, early detection is key.  With my parents and myself, we all went to the doctor as soon as we suspected we may have it, got antibiotics, and are fine.  But a few others did not get treatment soon enough and had a pretty bad time, like a few years of severe health issues.  Basically any time you have been in an area with ticks, you need to check yourself thoroughly as soon as possible.  Don't forget to check your hair too!  It's usually the nymph ticks that spread the disease and they are extremely tiny, like the size of a flake of black pepper.  The ticks actually have to be attached for a while, like almost two straight days or something, in order to transmit the disease.  So even if you find one biting you, don't panic if it hasn't been there for too long.  But if you do find a tick biting you and you suspect you may have Lyme disease, go to the doctor immediately, explain why you think you have Lyme, and get some antibiotics.  Not everyone gets Lyme symptoms, so that's why checking for ticks is important.  In my case I found a nymph deer tick biting me but the doctor said to wait and see if I have symptoms. I did develop a rash where the tick bit me, and I started having some bad neck pain right at the same time as when the rash appeared.  The symptoms didn't appear until almost a month after I found the tick, but I went back to the doctor and got the antibiotics. The symptoms all disappeared about 3 days after I started antibiotics, and I was only on antibiotics for two weeks.  I'm fine now, but I should have been more persistent with the doctor when I first found the tick biting me and gotten the antibiotics right away.",

Many different factors can contribute to immunosuppression and make a person less likely to beat it especially if they don't get abx soon enough. Also co-infections (babesia, bartonella, etc) make it harder to beat Lyme.  \n  \nIt's a false statement, though, that you can't get it unless they're attached for over 36 hours. I got 5 tick bites and none of them were on for more than 8 hours and I got it. Bull's eye rach and everything. Been fighting it for going on a year not and I'm nearly completely recovered. I should mention that I think I got it bc think I was immunocompromised at the time bc we were living in an old rental house with bad toxic mold and mycotoxins are def immunosuppressive. Also, I didn't get antibiotics until day 14 after being bitten and it was 5 different ticks, with one of them being a nymph. I'm so much better and still improving with antibiotics and other rigorous treatment.   \n  \nThe main thing I'm trying to kick now is the babesia. I get these spasms in random spots on my body, especially when stressed. And they're like deep and repetitive. And no it's not an electrolyte imbalance, I've had a ton of different blood tests. It's just pretty annoying at this point and NO WHERE near the literally effing hell it used to be. My only other Lyme symptom at this point is poor short term memory (which is improving) and also I require a LOT of sleep or I feel like crap\u2014 like 8.5-9.5hrs. Minor inconveniences comparatively.  \n  \nStill trying to kick these bugs completely after 10 months of treatment, and the risk of regressing bc of stressful life events or serious physical injury constantly looms over me. There's no way but forward though, so I truck on.",

It wasn't until my fever hit 105 that my mom said screw the pediatrician and took me to the ER, where they finally drew blood and found out what was going on. Doctors had previously wrote it off as a virus, then an infection and were just prescribing low doses of antibiotics. I never had the bullseye, or it was never visible. After getting the right antibiotic dose, it took weeks to heal. My knees were the size of softballs and like you, still have problems with them and my hands to this day. I have some issues with fatigue and memory loss, but its speculation if that is caused by it or not. Catch it early, that's all I can say",

Trouble is some ticks are tiny, so pay close attention to small areas that itch a lot. Very likely a tick bite or a tiny tick embedded and hard to see.  PS 36 hrs sounds right for disease transmission. I make sure to do a full body check and HOT HOT \ud83d\udd25 shower daily, often removing 5+ attached ticks daily. Full body check to get them off, hot shower controls itching at bites for about 6 hours for me.",

They weren\u2019t bred for warm climates and humans have much better stamina than almost any other land mammal; we sweat and cool off, most other animals don\u2019t, hence why you can run deers and other prey down if you can track them, eventually they get too overheated/tired \n\nAlso depends on how long the hikes are; huskies have better stamina in the arctic because they\u2019re cooled down through their paws and not just panting like other dog breeds.",

Just got off antibiotics for a nasty bronchitis, but I had been bitten twice already within the previous week, so the nurse gave a me a two-for one antibiotic that tackles both.\n\nAlways good to prevent rather than treat. I usually forget about spraying my stuff until I have picked off a few. So, it is now time to get out the big bottle. \n\nWe treat our dogs, but they still come in on them and fall off. Vacuuming is as important as is the flea collar and/ or meds.\n\nThe best way is to check yourself and get the tick off ASAP - within hours. The longer it is able to feed on you, the more likely it will transmit something whether it is lyme, rocky mountain spotted fever, erlichiosis or a few others.\n\nJust know that the bullseye rash is not always seen in lyme disease. If you get one, definitely get treated, but if you have other symptoms after having been bitten, see a doctor. Lyme can be treated easily if caught early and treated with certain antibiotics. For some people, if not treated quickly or at all, it can be pretty bad.\n\nWhen I get bitten, the aftermath similar to a mosquito bite. It itches fiercely and will tend to get scratched and puffy for several days.\\\\And once you have picked on off yourself you will feel every little piece of anything that touched your skin and  run in and check yourself. At least I do.",

Again go look up oils and natural stuff if dupont products scare you.\n\nChoose your clothing wisely as it can make all the difference. Wear closed footwear (not sandals) and socks. Tuck your pants into your socks. Wear a long-sleeved shirt tucked into long pants. Light coloured clothing also helps because you will be able to see the ticks easier.\n\nDon't forget the dog - if yer out and about he should have already had this seasons tick pill and if not, why not?\n\nThis stuff is all over the web with one search but again  .....meh ......",

The rash isn't terrible but if you don't get it treated within a couple weeks of the bite there's a chance for a chronic nerve infection which can cause all sorts of nasty stuff like loss of eye sight etc. \n\n&gt;What are your strategies to keep the nasty bastards at bay?\n\nIt generally requires 10-24h for the tick to infect you with borrelia if it carries the bacteria. For this reason the best protection is to carry needle nose tweezers or a tick removing tool of some sort and just periodically check your skin thoroughly. In addition put your trouser trunks into your socks, wear long sleeves etc.\n\nThere's also a Lyme's vaccine being developed which I'm getting as soon as I can. The antibiotic treatment is not a joy ride. Had it a couple years ago and my gut is still recovering",

The poison kills ticks and flees, and is harmless to dogs and humans. They have a mildly unpleasant smell though - so we only use them during tick season or of the dog catches fleas from another dog.\n\nWith experience, you can use that smell to judge how effective the collar is. Depending how much time your dog spends in the rain/etc the collar eventually needs to be replaced. If I did want to walk int he grass, I bet you could put one of those dog collars around each boot or something and any tick that jumps on you will die. I'd rather do that than soak my boots or cothing in a stinky poison as some people recommend.\n\nLyme disease is pretty rare where I live, but we do have paralysis ticks which can kill a dog and make a human *very* sick (in theory, they can kill humans too but in practice we recognise the symptoms and remove the tick early enough to avoid that... by the time you notice the behaviour change in an animal it's often too late - goes from \"hmm they don't have much of an appetite\" to \"oh fuck they can't move\" really quickly).",

I do tick screens every day: quick ones on the trail, and a long, careful one at the beginning and end of each day. Noticing them quickly is key. I often find them by feeling rather than seeing. \n\nThis may sound like a lot of checking, but I'm the only one in my family who has never had Lyme. I'll probably get it eventually, but I attribute my long streak to my paranoia.",

At the end of your hike or a couple of times a day if out for longer periods make sure you don't have any ticks - if you do make sure to pull them out properly\n\nI have the antibodies for borrelia aka lyme disease but have several other autoimmune diseases so no one can tell unless you go take a look at my spinal fluid haha, so yeah thats one trick - have enough other shit going on that you don't have to think about lyme",

My joints swelled up massively and it was pretty painful. Without treatment it can potentially kill you. \n\nMy best advice is be vigilant and check yourself out.",

Like other people have said, every situation and individual is different. Your reaction may vary. \nOne thing people never talk about is Morgellons disease, which is is a form of Lyme disease. It affects both animals and humans. \nI wish well you well on your journey to wellness!",

They need to be on for a decent amount of time to transmit any nastiness. Don\u2019t be afraid to check everywhere and often. I tend to drop my undies every hour or so and have a once over. Never had Lyme even though I\u2019ve pulled hundreds of ticks",

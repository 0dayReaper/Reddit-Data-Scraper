This will GREATLY extend the life of your ferrorod. \n\nIt\u2019s all about the surface area of the tinder. \n\nNice axe!\n\nGood luck\u2014-",

The benefit of the ferrocirium rod used in this clip is that it's pretty unbreakable , will last for thousands of fires, many many more than a lighter. It can be used in windy conditions where a naked flame would fail and also works when wet as opposed to other methods. On top of the sytems of fire lighting that you might carry like matches, lighters, ferro rods, magnifying glasses, flint and steel etc there is also the knowledge and skill to make fire by friction etc \ud83d\ude42. The key to making your fire starting equipment last a long time in the wilderness  is to be always prepping for the next fire ( charred punk wood etc)",

Having the blade of the axe secure and stationary in the chopping block makes this another level safer than hand holding the axe.  \n\nTypically the next step to this method would be to transfer the ember/flame to a suitable location. I don\u2019t believe sharing that part of the fire preparation was the intention of this video though.  \n\nThanks to OP for sharing this useful and very safe technique!",

Do you prefer MREs, frozen freeze dried shelve stuff or would you trust something canned, or home preserves type of thing.\n\n{EDIT}  Thanks for the great info!  Appreciate it!  Because someone asked this is related to a outdoor situation for in relation to having to basically set up a long term camp was the thought!",

In a survival scenario you're looking to get found before food is too much of an issue but it's just so easy to have a box of meal replacement bars on hand which you don't need to heat and which put some calories in you or a companion.",

Some of the dehydated meals have a very long shelf life, and canned goods are generally pretty good indefinitely as long as the can is undamaged ( fruits and acidic items like tomatoes tend to go bad quicker ). There's some really good prepper videos on YouTube that deal specifically with food storage and pros and cons of differnt methods and brands.",

            "comment": "For long term storage in a remote place, vehicle storage, or other storage where temperature extremes can be a issue... freeze dried meals seem preferable... but only if there will be no shortage of water. Just need a kettle and some potable water you can heat up. Can also be purchased in #10 cans (i.e. Mountain House) making them fairly pest proof. Do some testing before bulk purchases so you get stuff you'll enjoy. (Mountain House and Peak Refuel being worth the extra money for taste.) Good for if you have relatively limited storage space. Lightest weight option.\n\nNothing against MRE's... even liked some of them... and having a few on hand isn't the worst idea as they can be good for a hot meal when the power is out and a fire isn't recommended if you have the associated self heating bags and a potable water to activate them and make the drink mixes. They are fairly self contained in that way and can even be eaten cold. Portable... but not as light weight as freeze dried. Can be made more compact by ditching excess packaging and items you don't personally require.\n\nIf you have a secure location with moderate temperatures and a Kitchen with plenty of pantry space... canned foods may be the way. Especially if it is stuff you'd eat anyway so you can constantly rotate stock. You can even stock supplies of bulk raw ingredients... salt, sugar, flour, dried beans, rice, nuts, peanut butter, jars of jam, pickles, canned tomatoes, etc... and be able to use the ingredients in various meals... make fresh bread, biscuits, pizza dough, pasta. Generally only for set locations... though you can make meals to go.",

MREs are twice the weight of Freeze-dried because, as the name implies, they are ready to eat. Freeze-dried meals need to have water added for the preparation. So if you are traveling and have a water source, go with freeze-dried. If you are more stationary and have limited fresh water, go with the MREs. I personally have three days of MREs, three days of freeze-dried meals, and a 4,800-calorie emergency bar in my one-week Bug Out Bag.",

    "postText": "Evening all, \n\nI was wondering if anybody on this subreddit located in the province of Ontario knows a good and reputable establishment that teaches wilderness first aid courses as well as wilderness survival courses. Preferably one that is recognized by the government of Ontario, and where the certification can be used on an application. \n\nI\u2019ve seen A LOT of private businesses that provide these courses and they all seem good, but with the amount of places that provide courses, it\u2019s hard to choose one that\u2019s reputable. \n\nI\u2019ll continue to do my own research on places, but thought I\u2019d drop this into Reddit to see if anybody had advice! \n\nThanks!",

But one of the BEST programs I ever completed was Wilderness First Aid (covered EMT) as more wilderness based thru the National Ski Patrol training program I was in at the time. You may want to do some research into training that way regarding wilderness and cold weather based. It's been years but a possible route you may want to try researching for your needs. Good luck and be safe out there.",

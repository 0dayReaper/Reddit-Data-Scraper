It has a few things in common, such as constructing the bend on a bight in the hammock material, but there are a LOT of differences.",

It appears to be a Hangman's Knot, tied as a bend rather than a knot, with a slipped bight finish. \n\nIt's tied similar to a Sheet Bend, but the Sheet Bend would have the wraps passing underneath the loop created by the first strand of green line instead of over it. Any more than two wraps for a Sheet Bend are pointless and can make it more likely to jam. Sheet Bends are also easy to inspect because they are structurally identical to a Bowline. \n\nThis is a pretty neat one.",

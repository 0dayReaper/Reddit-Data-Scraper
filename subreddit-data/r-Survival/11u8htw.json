Small enough that you can finesse it when scraping but big enough that you can still chop through some very good sized logs.  Others have mentioned some of the good foldup saws - these are indispensible, particularly for firewood collection.  Yes, you can fell a tree with a small axe, but it is much easier and quicker to use an axe and saw - cut the bottom of the notch and then complete it with the axe.  And then use the saw for the back cut.\n\nBatoning does work, but only for smaller logs but if you aren't careful, you will end up with a broken knife (just look on Youtube about this).  And ending up with a broken knife in a true survival situation is not a good thing.",

That you are testing the waters to see if a small axe/hatchet is for you.   \n\n\nSo for a first time small axe/hatchet, I would recommend getting a decent but cheap axe/hatchet. So either a Fiskars or Morakniv hatchet. Use it, beat up on it, learn to sharpen it. And \"if\" you decide this is a tool you enjoy using. Then get a premium axe like the Gransfors Bruk small hatchet.",

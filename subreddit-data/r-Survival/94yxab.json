            "comment": "I've fallen through ice before. This would have came in handy had I seen this beforehand. \n\nRight before my head went under I gasped for breathe from the shock. It was surprisingly deep for a pond. My feet never touched the bottom. Upon realizing that, I started kicking small, controlled kicks to push myself up to the surface. Emerged, took a big breath and was facing the shore, which was about 7 or 8 feet away.  \n\nI was kind of panicking so I started smashing the ice in front of me with my bare hands and swam forward. Got out with bloody hands. Luckily for me it was only somewhere around 30 degrees or so. So the chill wasn't bad. ",

I did the same thing where I tried to get up and found myself just smashing ice in front of me. It's all about spreading the weight over a surface area which I figured out pretty quickly, otherwise it could have been some bad hypothermia. I finally rolled over onto the ice and rolled to safety where my friends were on the shore who carried me home. ",

If you start to feel cold again then the long term effects of hypothermia will start to set in from my understanding. ",

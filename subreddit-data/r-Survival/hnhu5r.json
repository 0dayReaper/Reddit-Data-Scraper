It's not a cost issue, because it's not particularly cheap.  My ESEE 4 is far more affordable and IMHO, a far more durable knife.   \n\nAs for its potential to float,  in order for that to happen it will have to displace the same amount of water, in weight, as the knife weighs.  That looks like a Boker Apparo, which weighs just over a pound.   That would require the air volume to displace a 1 pound of water, which works out to be about a pint-sized container.   The capsule is never going to provide that much buoyancy.   It'll sink like a stone.",

However, for the other aspects of your issues with the knife, I would say that the limits on the knife could be considered not actual limits. For example, you might say that the knife can not be used to chop a tree. However, with the right know-how, you could use the knife to fashion a hatchet.\n\nIn addition, I would personally never bring a hollow handle knife out in wilderness without also bringing a hatchet.",

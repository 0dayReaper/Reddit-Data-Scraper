You hit it on the back of the head with your hand or a stick, let the rabbit stop twitching (sometimes they twich for a while after you kill them), and then skin them. They barely bleed during this process and the skinning is just as clean as shown in the video.",

Or, ankles and wrists, same V down to the anus and then basically peel them down to the head. You may need to use a knife to separate a few bits from the body but it should peel all the way to the head. At that point you can cut the head or take the time to skin the head so you get the face along with the skin. It takes a little longer than 30 secs but not by much. The skinning, breaking and tanning of the hide is what takes time but it\u2019s worth it for a nice rabbit skin.\n\nEdit - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D26gau9Evd4 this isn\u2019t exactly my process but you can see what I mean by \u201cundressing\u201d them.",

Otherwise it's a small knife and lots of patience. They are much harder than a rabbit.   \n\nPigs you can keep the skin on but you want to boil a big tub of water, enough to dip the whole pig in and then shave it, its hard work but worth it if you want crackling. You can also burn it off but it can ruin the skin for crackling, if not it's the same as skinning any large animal, lots of patience.",

Originally thought you were directing the fucktard message at all vegans, but you meant just the ones who brigade. I'm in complete agreement with the chap above who correctly points out that this has got to be more ethical than factory farming and this sub is about survival skills. If it's me or the rabbit, then the rabbit gets it every time, whether I'm vegan or not in normal daily life. Rabbit is an underappreciated meat and we'd all do well to diversify our eating habits to avoid the damage done by farming in propagating monoculture, meat-eater and vegan alike.",

Reddit is the entirely wrong place to take a stand on whatever it is you think you're taking a stand against.\n\n&gt; ...forcing communities to tag all meat pics as NSFW is one of the goals of the brigaders.\n\nDon't hold out because of your emotions, use your brains instead. No one gives a fuck about brigaders, but I'd assume most people ***do*** care about others losing their means of making a living. Also, almost every other community doesn't have an issue with this, because they understand what the consequences of not doing so are.\n\n&gt; Two, animal processing is a central skill of survival training.\n___\n&gt; Finally and most importantly, animal processing is a deeply spiritual and unique aspect of the traditional cultures who we derive our survival skills from; we won't help censor the sharing of such skills.\n\nYou aren't going to find many businesses that give a shit about either of these reasons, and hence can't be a reason to uphold your decision. I mean hell, it's not even censorship, and has absolutely _nothing_ to do about your subreddit personally. It's looking out for your fellow human being. If someone says they don't want to see content that will get them fired, respecting that decision seems _stupidly_ reasonable.\n\nI'm self-employed so I couldn't give two shits personally, but man... I wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing I was getting people fired.\n\nI'd sincerely appreciate you taking time out of your day to ponder this further.",

Then you might look at \"anomalies\" on the different organs, if you see something unusual that you aren't able to identify it's better to just avoid eating it.\nThis is all pretty obvious so it's not gonna be super helpful i guess but there you go.",

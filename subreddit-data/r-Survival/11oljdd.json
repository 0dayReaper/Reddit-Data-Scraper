Got two pair that were given to me as a gift in the mid 1990s I think (is that even possible,have they been around that long??) that have been going strong and I give them no special consideration in the wash. They were part of my regular sock rotation every winter. The only special treatment they get is: no walking around in them without shoes (indoors etc).",

Using a wash bag could is helpful to avoid losing them and reduce  contact  with hot metal Prevent snagging on velcro or hooks or anything else.   I only use fragrance free \u201call free and clear\u201d  nothing scented or enhanced as these do not play well with wool fibers.  When people use tide detergent on merino it reeks IMO like yhr chemicals and adhesives are right on the fiber and feels sticky.  Also I wouldn\u2019t directly apply  castile soap or dish soap- if you must hand wash then dilute the soap - like muddle a small amount of unscented liquid dish soap in water then muddle the socks then drip dry",

Plenty of game, but not a whole lot of food that grows in abundance that you coul rely on for forages. If you were interested in farming something, the only thing that would be successful would be ground plants like onions and what not.",

The Pacific Northwest larger mammals (who weren\u2019t grazing) depend on fat rich salmon and other fish and other game for calories",

            "comment": "Bing' ~ \"There are some wild edibles that you can forage in the high sierras at about 7000 feet elevation. Some of the most common and easy to identify ones are:\n\nWild berries\u00a0such as blackberries, raspberries and rose hips.\u00a0Be careful to avoid any white or unknown berries and test them on your lips before eating1.\n\nWild plants\u00a0such as dandelions, clover, miners lettuce, cattails and pine nuts.\u00a0These plants are abundant and nutritious and can be eaten raw or cooked12.\n\nBark\u00a0from willow, birch, pine, basswood, spruce, fir and tamarack trees.\u00a0The inner layer of the bark can be eaten raw or boiled1.\n\nHowever, you should always be careful when foraging for wild food and follow some basic guidelines:\n\nProper identification\u00a0of wild edibles is essential.\u00a0Find a mentor, get a good book or use a reliable app to help you recognize the plants2.\n\nSustainable foraging\u00a0means taking only what you need and leaving some for the wildlife and future harvests.\u00a0Avoid picking rare or endangered plants2.\n\nForaging safely\u00a0means avoiding plants that have been sprayed with pesticides or herbicides, or that grow near roads or polluted water sources2.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that cooking at high elevation may require some adjustments in time and temperature, as water boils at a lower point and air is thinner3.\n\n\"\n\nThere are also some edible roots that you can forage in the high sierras at about 7000 feet elevation. Some of the ones that I found are:\n\nDaylily roots\u00a0(Hemerocallis sp.) - These are the roots of the orange-flowered daylilies that grow in gardens and along roadsides.\u00a0They are edible raw or boiled and have a nutty flavor12.\n\nCattail roots\u00a0(Typha sp.) - These are the roots of the tall plants with brown cigar-shaped flower heads that grow near water.\u00a0They are edible raw or cooked and can be ground into flour31.\n\nQueen Anne\u2019s lace roots\u00a0(Daucus carota) - These are the roots of the wild carrot, which has white umbrella-shaped flowers and a hairy stem.\u00a0They are edible raw or cooked and taste like carrots, but be careful not to confuse them with poison hemlock, which has smooth stems and purple spots1.\n\nArracacha roots\u00a0(Arracacia xanthorrhiza) - These are the roots of a plant native to the Andes, which has yellow or purple flesh and a celery-like aroma.\u00a0They are edible cooked and have a starchy texture4.\n\nAs always, be sure to properly identify any wild root before eating it and avoid any that look suspicious or unfamiliar. Also, wash them well and peel off any tough skin before consuming them.",

If they are feeling dizzy and showing early signs of shock, raise their legs.\n\n\n2. Examine the wound (as quickly as possible) to assess:\n\n* The type and extent of bleeding.\n\n* The source of the bleeding.\n\n* Whether there are any foreign objects embedded in the wound \u2013 if so, do not remove them as they will be stemming bleeding, but apply direct pressure either side of the object.\n\n\n3. Apply direct pressure to try and control bleeding. If you control the bleeding with this direct pressure, keep holding for 10 minutes as it takes this long for clots to form.\n\n\n4. Once you control bleeding, dress the wound \u2013 if the wound bleeds through the first dressing, apply another on top. If the wound bleeds through the second dressing you should consider alternative options to stop the bleeding.\n\n\nThe first step when treating a catastrophic bleed is always to apply direct pressure. It is still likely to be the first and only solution needed for the casualty.\n\n\n(Tourniquets and haemostatic dressings have been introduced as additional options to treat severe catastrophic bleeding. However, direct pressure remains the main choice of treatment and it will control bleeding in the vast majority of cases. The European Resuscitation Council 2015 guidelines state that haemostatic dressings and tourniquets should be used when direct pressure is either not possible or ineffective.)",

Being able to quickly identify the need for a tourniquet is critical, and non-commercial improvised TQ's are ill advised for backwoods use. A tourniquet should be a part of your first aid kit, especially in the backwoods, and especially if you are carrying tools that could inflict injuries resulting in serious bleeds.\n\nSources?

            "comment": "For the best information, I suggest you become a basic EMT, and then take the wilderness portions of training. . from there advance to a paramedic. . By that time, you have a pretty good understanding of what is going with injured persons and how to deal with it.  \n\nFrom there you can become a Physicians Assistant or A Nurse and Nurse Practitioner.  Which will give you a whole lot more autonomy.  If you want the latest data, try Paul Auerbachs ***Wilderness medicine***.  It is currently a two book set with lots of information from not just America, but all corners of the world.  The books are available on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com).  There are lessor books by Auerbach, but ***Wilderness Medicine*** is currently at $162.70, with a new enhanced version at . . . $456!\n\nThere are some older versions that still offer good information at much less.",

                            "comment": "I can totally understand that, and sympathize.  I would offer that if you can manage just the basic EMT class you would be worlds above most people.  \n\nIt offers a great basic understanding of most common medical emergencies.  The other thing that is great is that you also usually spend two shifts on an Ambulance, and two shifts in an ER . .. mostly to observe, but at least you get some real world experience in seeing the sort of wounds and emergencies you are likely to ever encounter.  \n\nFunny thing, the basic EMT class started out in the early 1970's as an 81 classroom hour program, and has evolved these days to what amounts to a 4 or 5 semester hour class.  It is usually offered at a local vo tech at night at a reasonable price.  \n\nAnd if worse comes to worse. the American Red Cross still offers first aid classes, and has some that are on line:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Wilderness-Medicine-Auerbach/dp/0323597556\n\nAdditionally, as I noted, Auerbach has a couple of much less extensive books at a much more reasonable price.  These books are geared to wilderness injuries specifically.  \n\nSee for instance: [https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Wilderness-Medicine-Auerbach/dp/0323597556](https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Wilderness-Medicine-Auerbach/dp/0323597556)\n\n Hope this helps!",

This is not a medical survival kit. I would say 2 things on this list are in my 2nd line medical gear. This isn't close to what should be first thought for medical IMO. \n\nTrauma kit with some of these items added on for minor care. \n\nTourniquet- 1 or 2. CAT or SOF-T \nGauze- 2+ Z-fold gauze or Hemostatic gauze packs\nPressure dressings- 1-2 Oales flat packed\nChest seals- 1 or 2 sets. Hyfin compact is my primary \nAirway management- NPA fit to your people more advanced options for providers. \nHypothermia prevention- SOL space blanket at a minimum.  \nI would also add a QuikLitter flexible litter. \n\nBurn dressings and burn gel. Rolled gauze,  4x4 gauze, ABD pads, medical tape.  Glacier Gel blister bandages, mole skin, sterile needles/catheter. Roll or 2 of Coban, large and small SAM Splints. Butterfly sutures (and staples if trained to do) \nTrauma shears (One Shear Trauma shears and minis are my go to shears) \n\nOTC meds. Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Benadryl, Pepto, alcohol prep pads (nausea) Anti-chaffing cream (Blue Steel) sun screen packets, bug spray or wipes. Tums, tooth repair/ache kit, triple antibiotic. \n\nRX meds for anyone in your group. If your trip is supposed to be 3 days. Have at least 7 days of meds in a waterproof bag in orginal bottles. \n\n**** Anyone who is traveling with your group should have a card that is sealed with medications. Card should include known environmental allergies, drug allergies, current medications and dose. Any medications used in the past for chronic illnesses or injuries that may flare up. Also you should have existing injuries that could show up. If someone has a bad knee or back injury. You will know this is an existing problem not something related to a medical situation. These cards should also have primary doc, specialists, pharmacy, emergency contact's and next of kin if things are that serious ****\n\nI would trash the CPR mask and add a BVM (Bag Valve Mask) to actual provide supplemental breathing.",

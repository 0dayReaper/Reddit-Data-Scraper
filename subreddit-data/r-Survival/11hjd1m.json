They're so similar and both really great materials. I have both kinds of wool socks, gloves, and hats and sometimes the sheep wool feels warmer sometimes it's an alpaca pair. I think baby alpaca wool is the best quality material but sheep wool is the cheaper option therefore the smarter purchase",

I asked if I could have it, and he said \"No. Get away from me.\" Then he started to walk away.

The only benefit to wool is that it can be used next to a fire without worry about spitting embers melting holes. The warm when wet argument doesn't hold water because the others, except non-hydrophobic down, can be squeezed and shaken out and put back on damp. They are hydrophobic so will dry from body heat fairly quickly. Wool is hygroscopic and so will stay uncomfortably damp for a long time.",

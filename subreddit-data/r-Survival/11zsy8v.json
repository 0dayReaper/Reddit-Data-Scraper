They capture a mostly gone style of life for the people that lived in the Appalachian's in the 70's.  I suspect most of those people who told the stories have passed, and at this point, many of the reporters are passing as well.\n\nCertainly, the material is not available anywhere else! I had been given Foxfire 1 by an aunt.  According to the inscription in the front cover, \"***Merry Christmas, 1973***.\"  \n\n**YEP, 50 YEARS OLD NOW!** \n\nOf course the same aunt gave me a copy of the **Last Whole Earth Catalog** a year or two before.\n\nThe other thing that is really sad is that whole paradigm of 1970's scholarship and enterprising spirit to bring new material such as *Firefox books* and the *Whole Earth Catalog,* has been absent for far too long now.\n\nI hate to say it, but the damn generations since are too involved historically with Nintendo, X box, and now ***tic toc*** to even consider what is going on in the world around them.  The internet has been great, but man, it sucks too!",

Homesteading isn\u2019t really survival. \n\nSurvival is SAS by wiseman.\n\nHomesteading is everything from making your home to gardening/canning.\n\nThere won\u2019t be one book to cover it all. It\u2019s best to pick a topic and go from there. Want to know how to can? YouTube and books are the best way to learn unless you have someone you know who does it.\n\nAnd survival is best studied by hiking and camping and using those times as practice. Bring along a book for identifying plants in the area you\u2019re hiking/camping in. YouTube and books here too. Don\u2019t watch survival channels. Watch camping channels. Get into camping and backpacking. Then start watching good survival YouTube channels.",

I am not sure which came first and I only read it in spanish.\n\nHaving been a medic in the US army, I found this book to be pretty impressive. It discusses how far latrines should be from a sleeping or cooking site, how to build them hygenically.  It also discusses herbal remedies and basic life saving measures. It teaches many of the things the US army teaches about basic survival skills in a comprehensive way. Whether preparing for SHTF or you have a rural emergency that will take first responders time to respond to, most people can benefit from the information in this book.",

            "comment": "I had some 100 watt panels that have been sitting under this New Mexico sun not being used, so I figured I'd change that. This contraption can output 110 v AC or DC current with fully adjustable voltage. I can plug in various charging adapters as well, to meet the needs of whatever device wants juice. Onboard is also a multimeter to adjust the DC (the tiny circuit board next to the multimeter) as well as a pouch with battery electrolyte tester, adapters, and some repair items.\n\nThe panel goes to the solar charge controller top left, which keeps the deep cycle marine battery topped off. The battery goes to an AC inverter and a DC buck converter. Since the battery is lead acid, I built a swinging carriage for it to keep it level and avoid spilling acid. When it comes time to move it, the legs fold up and lock into the frame, then the whole thing is tipped panel up and rolled along.\n\nI opened up every electrical component and potted the PCB's in epoxy for added weather and shock resistance. There are still a few things left to do, like finishing the protection for the front of the panel, adding shoulder straps for hauling on foot, and beefing up the frame somewhat. I'm kind of blown away by the performance of this thing, it's managed to charge my chainsaw, electric bike, cordless driver, run laptop and monitor, etc. It's gonna be pretty handy I think.",

Shading will drastically reduce the amperage output of your solar module and impact the charging rate of your deep cycle battery. Otherwise a really cool setup.

While it sounds like a great idea, an increase in temperature on your solar module will actually decrease the voltage of the module and in turn reduce the wattage of output (volts X amps). So while a slight amperage gain could increase wattage with the use of solar reflectors, you will lose voltage due to high module temp and just put you back at where the module would have been without the reflector. Additionally, increased heat will degrade your modules life span faster. Another thing I wanted to mention is the cage you are using to \u201cprotect\u201d the face of the module. Solar modules are rated to take the impact of golf ball sized hail without issue. I have seen them take some serious beatings. The part of the panel you really want to protect is the white coating on the back of the module. If that gets scratched it could cause a thermal event between the cells and cause a fire. So keep that area safe.",

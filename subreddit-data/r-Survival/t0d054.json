I assume iPhones do the exact same thing.",

I guess I would rather see the world try and fail than to simply be too timid to do anything.\n\nI can't help but think, prior to the most recent Russian invasion, that the US and NATO countries should have asked their respective country's high ranking officials if they'd be willing to be sent as an envoy inside of Ukraine until things settle down or diplomacy prevails (if troops are off the table). I don't think Russia would be moving at the pace they are currently if several thousand representatives of NATO were embedded all across Ukraine in undisclosed locations. Russia wouldn't risk dropping bombs or attacking areas where a NATO country's high-ranking-whoever might be. That'd give NATO a reason to react, and neither side wants it. Russia would have to move slower and be more deliberate. I'm not an important person, but if I were, and my presence meant that I could slow down Russia's invasion, I'd certainly put myself in harm's way. Hell, if I were Biden I would just be chilling right next to Zelensky in person. Russia would not dare accidentally harm a US president. Just being around Biden would be safety. But even if I did get hurt, I showed the world I was willing to take a stand without using violence. There were and still are so many ways to help beyond sanctions. Money isn't everything. It hasn't convinced North Korea of anything, it surely won't work with Russia.",

Their soldiers died for an attack that hit us on our soil. That's what we should be doing for Ukraine right now. I refuse to value American lives more or less than any other.

Similar to how a spring loaded mousetrap works, pretty much. \n\nYou have a weight (spring on mousetrap),  \n\nYour pivot point being the top cross bar with another bar protruding vertically downwards (center bar on mouse trap with bait bar aligned vertically) \n\nThe weight is set to spin the top pivot point counterclockwise while winding the string from the water clockwise, but it is being blocked from doing so by the lose bar at the bottom being held by the tension of the rock wanting to fall. (With a mousetrap the main difference is the the mechanism that holds and releases the tension of the spring, but it is doing the same thing) \n\nAs soon as you pull that string in the water and relive the tension from the rock hanging slightly, the lose bar falls and allows the top pivot point to begin spinning.",

That means you need a tree that is strong enough to hold that much weight at a 5 foot height, which likely means a tree that is quite a bit taller than 5 feet (the tree in this video is likely 15-20 feet tall, and the branch he's using to support the string appears to be 8-10 feet from the ground). Granted that's not especially \"tall\" as far as trees in general go, but considering the person I replied to was worried about \"plants that thrive next to water holding a bend due to high moisture content\", I was simply pointing out that a design that relies on an unbending plant that's well over 5 feet tall close enough to the water to use as a fulcrum isn't really a great solution to that concern.",

You want to maximize your results while minimizing your effort.  Keeping a fire going all night, setting snares and fishing lines, building a shelter, and setting your signals, you need to do as much as you can, but efficiently.\n\nYou should question everything that people claim works well, to make sure it will work well for you.",

But making a net is extremely time consuming. \n\nNetting fish also takes skill and experience. You also have to know where to net fish as fish change location throughout the day. Other factors like barometric pressure and wind will change where they typically go. Netting sounds easy, but it really isn't. \n\nPeople have been making dead fall traps for probably just as long as nets, and they're easier and less time consuming to make from scratch. Fishing line is not needed, you can make cordage as line just as you would make cordage for a net. Although a net requires a ton of cordage. \n\nAs for a hook, there are many things you can fashion to work as a hook. Even a piece of wood can be used. In the right circumstances, of course. \n\nSorry to be a prude or stickler, but when I think of survival I think of \"the easiest method of doing something while spending the least amount of time\" But everyone has a different approach to things, you might feel more comfortable making a net. I would feel more comfortable using the same time to set multiple traps. To each is their own, right?",

If deadfall fishing was a high reward activity then indigenous people would be doing it but they don\u2019t, they use nets bc nets are high yield. \n\nThis whole sub is a fantasy where we make believe that you\u2019re out in the wilderness for potentially months, so why are we really concerned about time? You\u2019re not really in a a rush to get a single fish that will save your life. If you commit to being in the woods for months you have plenty of time to make a bet and the net will feed you more efficiently because you can catch more and larger fish. \n\nLastly how many times do you think this guy had to get a new worm because a minnow or crayfish ate it? What if the line snags on a branch when the trap is tripped? What if there are simply no fish at that point in the river or you want to move camp? You can\u2019t take a deadfall trap with you and the deadfall fishing has many points of failure that explain why no indigenous people do it",

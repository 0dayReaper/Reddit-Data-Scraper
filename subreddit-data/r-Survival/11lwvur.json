    "postText": "Battonning is usually thought of as being a splitting technique.  For cutting, most guys carry a very large, heavy survival knife, often in excess of 22 ounces, so as to have enough chopping momentum to efficiently process firewood-sized logs.\n\nWhat I have done instead for many years (other than just carrying a folding saw), is to use a much smaller, lighter knife, such as an ESEE 6, and instead of trying to chop through large cross sections of wood, I baton the knife INTO the grain like a wood chisel and remove wood chunk by chunk until I can fell/section the tree.  I can turn trees in excess of 6\" in diameter into piles of firewood quite easily like this, without having to carry a heavy chopping knife.  The only caveat is that the knife must have maximum impact resistance, meaning a full profile slab tang with no weak spots, and a moderate temper.  One of my favorite survival knives in my collection is [this discontinued Condor](https://www.smkw.com/condor-primitive-camp) that weighs less than 9 ounces (the description is wrong) and only has a 6\" blade.  With the above technique, this knife is capable of putting down a winter night's firewood completely by itself, no 22+ ounce chopper need apply.\n\nI don't spend alot of time in the YouTube wilderness survival universe these days, but it just surprises me that, to this day, I have never seen anyone demonstrate this technique, and many \"experts\" continue to advocate for very heavy knives.  I have literally been doing this for 15 years since highschool.  It also surprises me that people are still doing split battonning instead of using improvised wedges.",

    "postText": "I have seen many comments and posts about what has happened to r/prepping and other sub-reddit communities. If you aren\u2019t able to access or find a community right now it is likely due to the 48 hour protest response to the recent removal of 3rd party apps on Reddit. Some communities decided to make their communities private during this time as a statement of solidarity. We will continue to host r/survival for everyone\u2019s enjoyment and will allow general discussion about prepping until the 48 hours is over. Please continue to follow our other sub rules as they will continue to be enforced. Thank you for everyone\u2019s continued support.",

    "postText": "I live off grid above 2,500ft and we are currently in the midsts of a snow storm. \nThe amount of snow we\u2019ve been having is out of the ordinary for my area and it got me curious about a couple of things. \n\nI hike several miles everyday so I can get some sort of work out in and the dogs walked. From my knowledge, mountain lions seem to hunt around dusk and dawn and we definitely have them up here. I try to hike in between these hours but with the overcast days and the snow, it really feels like it could be any time of the day. I also don\u2019t know if hunting is more difficult for predators bc of the snow and if that make me more of target\u2014 especially with my dogs? \n\nI\u2019m always strapped (firearm) and have a knife, but not sure if there are other things to consider. \n\nGoing outside in rain or snow is important to my well-being, so any additional precautions to consider is much appreciated. \n\nTo sum it up: Does the the snow change hunting patterns for mtn lions? Am I in more danger bc of this? \n\nThanks.",

I emphasize the \"might\" because lordy no one should be declaring medical diagnoses of reddit strangers based on a few lines of text and no SAMPLE or, y'know, physically seeing the person at the time of chief med complaint. I'm also very hesitant to tell people they experienced worse than what they think, because folks have a tendency to exaggerate the conditions they've survived. So. That being given: we treat all suspected cold-related illness seriously, but some of the cues that are red flags are \"the umbles\": mumbling, stumbling, etc. Lack of coordination, lack of awareness for what's happening. Your state of awareness (assumed inability to follow simple instructions/tasks) &amp; clumsiness would, IMO, certainly require more swift intervention than needed for the people I've come across/treated who said \"I'm dangerously hypothermic, because I'm *cold* and *shivering*!\" (but who were just in the early stages of cold stress or mild hypothermia. Still needs treatment, but on a different scale of urgency.) Glad someone was there to assist. :)  \n\nedit: spelling, as always",

My only thinking is either you are either a true cold lover or you actually don't know what real cold is.\n\nI live in \"certified cold\" place, we get plenty of people that say they prefer cold here too but they also live indoors mostly when its cold yet oddly many of the same ones are outside all summer so its just mouth service. They might stay in on the extreme days or bitch about it when they are outside in the shade, but they are nowhere near outside for weeks when its cold.\n\nI can go sit outside in the middle of a heatwave in flordia while naked and while i might be miserable, some water and shade and I'm not dying. \n\nLast I checked when I go outside here during a cold snap my water won't even freeze before I die if i go outside naked and that water freezes damn fast.",

            "comment": "Mountain lions are primarily crepuscular, meaning they are active during dawn and dusk hours. However, they can also be active during the day or night, depending on their prey availability and the environmental conditions. During snowy weather, it can be more challenging for mountain lions to hunt due to the thick snow cover and reduced visibility. Therefore, they may be more active during the day to compensate for the reduced visibility during dawn and dusk hours.\n\nRegarding your safety, it's always a good idea to be cautious when hiking in areas where mountain lions are known to live. Walking during daylight hours and staying on established trails can help reduce your risk of encountering a mountain lion. Additionally, keep your dogs on a leash to prevent them from running off and potentially attracting a mountain lion. If you do encounter a mountain lion, try to make yourself look as big as possible and make loud noises to scare it away.\n\nCarrying a knife can be helpful for self-defense, but it's important to remember that it's not a guaranteed defense against a mountain lion attack. You might also want to consider carrying pepper spray or a bear horn, which can be more effective in deterring mountain lions.\n\nOverall, it's important to be aware of the potential risks and take necessary precautions when hiking in areas with mountain lions, particularly during snowy conditions when their hunting patterns may be altered.",

            "comment": "Lion hunters run lions with dogs, so that can be a deterrent, but I\u2019ve also seen video of them attacking dogs in yards. Still, I\u2019d rather have dogs with me than not, if only as a distraction while I activate my defenses. \n\nI had a significant fear of them when I first moved out west, but I\u2019ve watched about as many YouTube videos of encounters as I could find. That\u2019s given me a better idea of how an encounter could go.\n\nThey don\u2019t seem to care much about warning shots, so if you\u2019re going to shoot, make sure it\u2019s the last possible option and you\u2019re shooting to end it, if it comes to that. \n\nNever look away, never run. They prefer to attack when their prey isn\u2019t looking. Running will trigger their prey drive/chase instinct. It\u2019s amazing to me how they just refuse to move when being looked at. Maybe a hat with realistic eyes facing backwards would be a good deterrent. Serious suggestion. Some animals have patterns on the back of their heads that resemble eyes as a deterrent.\n\nThrowing rocks and sticks can be an effective deterrent/defense. Africans often use this method on the bush against leopard attacks.\n\nHaven\u2019t seen how they react to bear spray/pepper spray. Bears have highly tuned noses, cats seem to rely more on sight to hunt, so I don\u2019t have a gauge on how they might react to sprays. Still, it\u2019s better than not having spray.\n\nTalking with a Ranger once, she said they are taught to just prepare to fight with everything you have. They prefer an easy meal over a risky one. It\u2019s not a guarantee, but if you put up a good fight, you might get lucky and stop being worth the effort.\n\nI\u2019ve also learned that all predators have something called a prey profile in mind\u2026certain size range, mammals on four legs, birds on two, something they\u2019ve seen and been hunting their entire lives. Then a giant 5-7ft hairless, upright walking monkey comes along, it doesn\u2019t fit their prey profile, so they seem to get curious, and do things to sort of gauge your reaction until they can decide if your organs are worth whatever defense and fight you might have. Some are hungrier than others, some are more or less aggressive than others. \n\nBottom line, YouTube helped me get a sense of what I might expect, and that gave me my confidence back. Same with wolves, and there aren\u2019t too many videos with bears. Black bears don\u2019t worry me much because grizzlies kill them, so they\u2019re generally pretty skittish and will bolt asap. Grizzlies dgaf, so the best thing seems to be, just keep as much distance as possible, and don\u2019t smell like food or blood.\n\nPredator hunting shows and podcasts can help you learn more about their behaviors too. Nobody knows predators better from a first hand perspective than predator hunters. They\u2019re a wealth of knowledge. MeatEater just released a lion hunt video recently that I still need to watch. That group in particular are an excellent source of intelligent information on the subject.\n\nSorry for the long reply. There\u2019s a lot that you can learn on the topic.",

Snot, gagging, coughing, you could barely see anything for 5-10 mins. \n\nLong story short I realized that if you only carry spray, your life depends on wind direction.

Only advice I can give from my experience it to check behind you often. Both of them came up from behind and one was slightly elevated to stay in pouncing position for all I know. For peace of mind, carry a handgun. When it comes to your knife, it\u2019s really a last resort so keep it in a place that would be reachable if they are on top of you.",

For the other it just froze when I turned and spotted it\u2014it was kinda in the 4-5 o\u2019clock position moving through the sagebrush. It seemed like it didn\u2019t think I had seen it and was just trying to keep still/from being spotted, or maybe they don\u2019t charge until they are within a certain distance and are only in stealth mode. Idk. I kept my eyes on it and started walking backwards until I came around the track to where I lost line of sight and just booked it to the Jeep. \n\nI was small and definitely wouldn\u2019t have survived an actual attack, and also I lucked out thanks to who I was with for one, and how far from a vehicle I was for the other.",

Do you still have plenty of deer around?  If so, there is no reason to expect the lion to change its hunting pattern.  New and different prey is a risk they don't want to attempt unless desperate.\n\nAnd if the prey has moved, the lions likely moved with them.\n\nAre you at greater risk during these conditions?  Maybe.  But we're talking like 1/10,000 instead of 1/50,000, the risk is still very low.",

All of the trees in the video are from the Missouri/Illinois area. If you're interested in learning a bit more on how to identify a tree by its leaves, here is the link to the video: [https://youtu.be/2dn3szygmig](https://youtu.be/2dn3szygmig)",

Don't worry about the doubting Thomasette below, as at least you made an effort to put useful information out there for people who are interested.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to assume that most survivalists have at least purchased or have some level of plant identification guides available.  Clearly you cannot outline every dangerous plant, but sticking to the significant points about the infamous *Toxicodendron* species, and others might be good.\n\nOf course, with trees, things are a bit different, as I noted to the one redditor about a *hickory or sumac*. . The hickory is useful for a couple of reasons, good strong wood that does not ooze nasty problematic sap, and it does have marginally edible *fruit* and the other is a no good irritant!  As noted, just hit the high points of THIS IS BAD. . .sort of thing.\n\nBut once again, good work on putting yourself out there. . and making an effort.  You should bring the videos to your instructor (or former instructor's) attention, let them know you are putting the information to good use!\n\nThere is a great need for someone with any level of botany to explain the difference between good plants and bad. . especially those that have tiny white flowers, umbelliferous fruits and green stalks (with purple splotches, *conium maculatua*)  and another less innocuous plant that looks a lot like it.\n\nKeep it up!",

The video provides you with the basics of being able to identify trees using their leaves without being overbearing. Once you know the basics, then you can move towards more in-depth topics like what sorts of fungi grow best on what wood, edible fruits, and wood that is best for building/woodworking.

Such methods can get a person killed.  \n\nYes, what he has covered at this point is a bit dry, I will give you that. however, I am guessing that was his first offering.  And, those first ones can be tough as you don't know what you are going to say, or what you wish you had done differently until later.  Give the guy a chance. . .At least he is trying.    \n\n\nIf you want immediate survival information about plants, I would suggest purchasing the ***Audubon series of field guides*** for whatever plant you wish to identify.  They are pretty good generally, but sometimes omit a few things, or gloss over important points and how to distinguish from look alike other plants. I think you would find those guides more helpful than any survival book I have found to date.  (I have 4 shelves full to compare to.)  Some of the books seem to not even be from the same star system!  Seriously, some are OK, but none are great!",

This is why I have other sources such as the Audubon guides to provide better information.  \n\nSorry you did not like the guys first attempt at a video.  you certainly left enough comments to that effect!  I have to give the guy high marks for at least trying.  And there is a lot of talent out there, that will be the next generation.  The guy needs a little positive feedback. . .Not to be told that his material is dry and dull.  \n\nThis guy could be the next Cody Lundin. . .who by the way, I give high marks as well for his seminal book, ***9******8.6 degrees, how to keep your ass alive***\" and takes a different track in his book. . filled with cartoon characters and a bit of humor, he does a much better job keeping the readers attention focused than the older books.  (*which mostly tended to be dry recitation of endless facts*.) Not to mention, he attacks the problem of survival by examining the issue of temperature regulation, both too hot and too cold, and how those forces affect persons in unregulated environments.    \n\n\nStill, any given survival book does not attack all aspects of survival or plant identification. . Desert survival is different than North American forest/wilderness survival, which is nothing like Water survival after a ship sinks.   Nor does all the survival knowledge do your kid any good IF they cannot relate. . Hence the kids survival books.  Some are great, some suck.    \n\n\nLikewise, the survival books do not go into any depth about navigation, how to figure out where you are, and where you NEED to be, nor how to get there. . hence the books about navigation and emergency navigation.  Likewise, reading the stories of people who have survived some encounter gives information about what to expect, and how other people faced similar problems, as well as those who lived and who died, and why!  \n\n\nShort response, there is a lot of stuff even the best survival books do not cover.  Some books cover one thing well, and totally neglect other things.  Some are well written, some are as dry as the Sahara.  Some don't really say much at all.  They should offer the best information but the book would be almost an encyclopedia.  That is problematic for most people in a survival situation.  No matter what they have studied or read, it will inevitably be the one thing they did not study!",

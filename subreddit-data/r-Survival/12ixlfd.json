Assuming that i have found perfect location and knowing that there will be game around the hidden trap. If i catch an animal how long will it take to turn bad? Nobody wants to waste food especially if its been killed and id like some experts to help me with my problem if they know something about this. Sorry for bad english im from finalnd :)",

I\u2019d check fish and rabbit traps every 6 to 12 hours, the rest? Depends. But your English is awesome. Be proud.

If you put them out in the early morning and check them at night and they are, for numerous possibly reasons, broken, destroyed or gone, then you\u2019ve lost the potential food, the traps and the time. Fashioning new ones over night, in the dark while hungry is probably not going to happen so you\u2019ve lost an entire day and part of the next day. If you check 2-3 times a day you minimize your loss of food, time and energy. And you can always move traps if nothing is in them.",

            "comment": "Depends. If they're live traps, you *can* check them less often. Living animals don't rot. But to spare suffering, you still don't want to leave them very long. If it's a kill trap, like a snare or deadfall, I'd say to check every 3-10 hours or so. The first reason is that bloat can happen quite quickly once an animal dies. Depends on the size of the animal, and the general climate. Most bacteria grow at temperatures between 40F and 140F. But the issue is, they *really* thrive right around the middle of that range. That generally happens to be roughly the average operating body temperature of warm blooded creatures. Around 95-105F. Some bacteria can double in just 20 or 30 minutes at those temperatures. It's why things rot more quickly in warmer climates. And it's why, especially with larger game, that at least field dressing it ASAP is so important. Because by removing the organs, and opening up the body cavity, it hastens the cooling of the tissues. Left intact, a freshly dead animal begins bloating pretty much right away. It won't blow up like a balloon or anything, but the process starts that early. Even if there is bloat, it doesn't necessarily mean the muscle tissue is bad. But the digestive tract begins to swell with gases, making it tricky (and risky) to gut it without contaminating the meat. \n\nAnd all that stuff aside, scavengers have great noses. So if you successfully trap something, and a scavenger happens by, well your dinner becomes their dinner. If something has been pecking at, or chewing on something you generally don't want to eat it. Saliva carries some nasty stuff, and cleanliness and hygiene in a survival situation is iffy at best if not nonexistent.",

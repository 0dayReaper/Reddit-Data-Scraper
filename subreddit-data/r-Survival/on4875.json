Also, who the hell doesn't put the pop top these days?! I really thought it's unheard of a can without, until I bought like 20 of them and surpriseee no can opener and stabbing it with a knife got too much haha. I guess it's just convenience at this point, it's really good to know how to get around stuff without the necessary tools.",

Whenever I went in the supermarket I haven't seen them without pop tops and I always go for the cheaper stuff that I can buy in bulk. Not only that, I didn't even notice when I put them aside in my pantry, I just needed a can of baked beans and took me a whole minute to figure out what I'm looking for. Had to stab it with a knife to get the stuff out lol.\n\nThey are really tricky, they don't show a good image of the can, just the front so you really can't tell if they have them or not. \n\nI'm assuming it's to cut costs? I didn't know it's that expensive to put a pop top hahaha, but to me it just looks like that's the only reason.",

He's in the mountains in winter and everything is covered by at least 2-3 feet of snow. He's talking about how one can sometimes find food at the base of trees, and as he's saying this he's making a beeline for an  evergreen about fifteen feet away. He goes straight to the base of the tree and whips out a mushroom, commencing to happily munch away as he's 'proven his point.' It was so obviously placed there, and is such a cringe moment (even though everything he does is rather cringey).",

            "comment": "I love all the comments about how bad this is \u2026 however if you don\u2019t have a can opener or knife it is a very effective way to NOT go hungry. and it does not take much of a \u201dreasonably\u201c flat surface to open said can\u2026. And no you won\u2019t have a lot of metal in your food\u2026 no more so than with a lot of other methods of opening cans.\n\nand yes a P38 is small, lightweight, worth its weight in platinum (carry one on my key ring, have them in my GHB, BOB, car, brief case, lunch cooler, kitchen drawers, multitool sheath,etc) however I also know that they can be lost, eventually broken, be stranded somewhere without them for whatever reason, so knowing alternatives is never a bad thing\u2026\u2026",

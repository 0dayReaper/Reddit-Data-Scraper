    "postText": "For context my stomping grounds are basically surrounded by woods\n\nSo I was walking around my stomping grounds and I came across wild blackberry saplings. It was a big deal for me as a few years back there was a field of blackberries on my stomping grounds, till they get flattened for housing purposes, but now I think I found some of their saplings, yet I\u2019m hesitant to taking some of their berries due to the possibility of them not being edible and the wrong berry type\n\nDoes anyone know how to tell of some wild berries are edible? I remember someone saying that the yellow and white ones were to be avoided, but the blue and black ones are safe?",

They generally have compound leaves made up of 3-5 serrated leaflets (many species often get confused with poison ivy) and have thorns and/or bristles along the stems.  The flowers will be white with 5 long narrow petals that eventually turn into berries.  Never judge a berry by its colors.  White and yellow are generally to be avoided, but that doesn't mean that berries of other colors are edible.  Learn what the entire plant looks like, not just the part you are interested in consuming, and go off of at least 3 defining characteristics.  While you are learning, it's wise to use 3 sources to check against, and even wiser to find somebody experienced in foraging wild edibles to teach you.  Plant ID apps can help, but I would never solely rely on them, and I wouldn't consider them a source when researching a new plant. I would only use them to help point you in the correct direction for further research.  For example, a lot of apps confuse ground cherries for lambs quarters.  Ground cherries are a plant that you can only eat the ripe fruit; the rest of the plant is poisonous.  Lambs quarters is a plant that you primarily eat the leaves and seeds, so if you go solely off of the apps ID, you're gonna poison yourself if you choose to eat it.",

If it is an aggregate berry (raspberry-looking, basically the fruit developed from a cluster mini-berries that merge together) that's red or purple/blue, its good to eat. This covers basically all the fruit of the *Rubus* family, which have additional shared feature of prickly or spikey stems and vines.\n \n2. If it's round and blue/purple, and has a \"belly button\" (like a blueberry), it should be edible. This covers many of the edible species within the *Vaccinium* family. Be warned, poisonous [pokeweed berries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytolacca_americana#/media/File:Phytolacca_americana_cluster_-_single.jpg) technically fall into this category, so maybe have a forage guide handy to ID for sure before eating.",

I think white and yellow are the most dangerous, with red somewhere in between. And aggregate fruits (like raspberry, salmonberry, blackberry etc.) are something like 99% safe to eat globally. So you are almost certainly safe to eat anything that looks similar to a blackberry, in North America at least. \n\nThat said, just get a book on edible wild plants and actually ID plants before eating them. I *never* eat a plant I can't identify, because all rules have exceptions. When you're in the hospital and the doctor asks what happened, and your answer is \"it was a black colored berry I thought it was safe\" they're gonna look at you like an idiot. Just learn to ID plants.",

If a bear charges and swipes at you then yes you should immediately play dead, but otherwise it's not the best advice. \n\nBut in the case of a curious/not immediately aggressive bear, you should basically act submissive and slowly back away. Talk to the bear softly so that it knows that you know it's there, avoid eye contact, keep your head low, and back away slowly. It may even do a bluff charge where it runs at you until it's 10-20 yards away to see how you react. As hard as it may be, you are best off standing your ground until it either gives up the bluff charge or hits you, then immediately play dead and it will lose interest in you.",

Swing it around well before the bear even approaches.  \n2. Get loud. Yell. Shout. Scream.  \n3. ~~If the bear continues to pursue, head downhill, walking backwards, facing the bear the entire way.~~ *DO NOT RUN AWAY.*  [edit: incorrect]\n4. When the bear, as in this video, gets that close, hit it with your stick/armament. Aim for the face. Swing hard.  \n5. Stay in the open, not trees. Black bears can move faster than you can in woods. Stay in a field. And once you have at least 50 yards between you and the bear, run like hell. The bear will give up and leave you alone when there's enough distance between you. \n\nWatching this whole video, the guys in it handled this correctly. I'd also wager that this bear was just playing with them. Wild black bears can be curious and playful, like a wild dog. An angry black bear tends to puff up and hair out, raising its hackles and growling. It will also likely charge at you directly. This bear was just having fun. Not that it's any less frightening when that happens, because a bear \"having fun\" can still injure or kill you. But this bear wasn't trying to kill them.",

Just face the bear and back away first - my experience is that first I back away, then the bear backs away.  \n\n\nBlack bears are not always afraid of people anymore, they may think of you as a source of food, and they are curious. They do mess with people sometimes but attacks and deaths are very rare. It is important to keep the perspective that this is probably a manageable situation.  \n\n\nTitle is misleading. They are not being \"stalked\" by a bear. They are being followed and harassed by a bear but it isn't hunting them or stalking them.   \n\n\nThis is why it's important to make sure bears to not associate people with food.",

Not to sound pedantic but California grizzlies dont exist anymore and they were huge... bigger than a kodiak, and Kodiak Grizzley is a misnomer. Grizzlies are just inland brown bears. They are both Ursus Arctos. The general rule is that all grizzlies are brown bears, but not all brown bears are grizzlies. Their main difference is their diet, which is why coastal brown bears (like on Kodiak island) can be much larger than the inland Grizzley since they have more access to fat and protein rich foods like fish, mussels, etc.\n\nEdit: I should also mention that Black bears can be different colours, from jet black, to light brown, to blonde, to red, and even white in rare cases... which could be why some people have the wrong idea of what brown bears actually are.",

You can tell from its behavior that it is simply young, curious, and a bit skittish. You need to make it feel not skittish at all, but instead completely fucking terrified of the 7 or 8 foot tall jacket flinging yelling and screaming crazy-ass monster that it just encountered. It'll run off into the woods faster than you can say, \"DumdumSaysWhat?\"",

A bear this size can mess you up good.  If you have food, drop it, and back away.  If you're with someone stick close, look big.\n\nAs someone mentioned, if you see a cub, be afraid.

            "comment": "Black bears are not particularly known for their aggression toward humans.  Bluff charges and freaky sounds notwithstanding, blackies generally do not behave this way.  Black bear sows aren't even all that famous for protecting their young.  This doesn't mean that one should not obey the normal protocols pertaining to wild animals and their young (as there are never any absolutes), but the famous Black bear researcher, Lynn Rogers has actually conducted blood and hair sample collection on black bear cubs in their dens while their mothers circled, back in the trees, too afraid to approach.\nHowever!\nWhile unusual, black bear attacks normally indicate that you are on the menu.  Viewed on a one-to-one basis, black bear attacks lead to the consumption of human victims far more often than grizzly attacks do.  If a grizzly is behaving this way, it's usually because they're an aggressive species, and are generally pretty mad at the world.  An attack is most likely due to their need to put down a perceived threat.\nWhen a black bear persists in this way, it's safe to assume that it is hungry.  Anything you can do to dissuade it is advisable.  As many here have indicated, wave your jacket, scream, throw rocks and sticks; anything to send the message.  Beyond that, if the bear actually attacks, fight with everything you've got.  It's hungry, and you're delicious.\nHaving said all this, the only reliable way to swift resolution is through the use of a firearm.  This is not a recommendation.  Just stating a fact.  The bear is stronger and more dangerous than you, and you're unlikely to come out on top any other way.",

The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.\n\n  \nVisitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.\n\n  \nIt is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat. Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of squirrel fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper. \"\"",

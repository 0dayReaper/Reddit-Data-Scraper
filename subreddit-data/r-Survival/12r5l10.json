You can get some sap earlier on, but unless you're running a commercial operation with hundreds/thousands of trees you won't get enough to be worth it.\n\nMaple runs earlier than birch, and usually has a higher sugar content. Itxs also a different kind of sugar - maple is sucrose vs birch which is fructose.",

A spile is small and lightweight so it would be worth adding it to a survival kit. I think your best bet would be the humble Balsam poplar (*Populus balsamifera*, found in every province and territory except Nunavut). Trembling aspen (*P. tremuloides*) is even more widespread. However I don't know if you can actually get water out of these trees, I've never tried.\n\nThe famous Peeing Tree of Rosswood, BC I think is a black cottonwood (*P. trichocarpa*) which isn't found out east, though some consider it a subspecies of Balsam poplar (*P. balsamifera* subsp. *trichocarpa*). This is a tree that someone tapped and stuck a pipe in it; water pours continuously out of the pipe. The water is even quite delicious.\n\nOne thing you can do is eat the cambium layer of a tree for energy (this is the thin layer of conductive tissue just under the tree's bark). Interior Salish peoples did this with lodgepole pine. Be sure to cut a vertical strip (preferably small and narrow if you aren't too bad off), don't girdle the tree. I imagine you could do this with any non-poisonnous tree (and I don't think we have any in Canada??).",

There are places where that water bubbles up out of the ground as a spring, but those are pretty far apart and techniques like drawing water from trees is often necessary especially during a drought.\n\nYou can also dig a well of course, but you might need to dig a long way.",

Also, trees themselves are good indicator of water content in soil. Spruces and birches prefer wet soil while pines are fine with dry and sandy turf. So look at the trees and just try digging a bit near them.",

    "postText": "Berkeys are nice but too expensive imo. Going to a dry cabin in Alaska for a few months, not too far from Fairbanks so I could just buy water, but would like to have something to filter so I have the option in case the vehicle doesn't run. \n\nI bought the Sawyer squeeze kit, but returned it because neither inline adapter [fit my water pack hose](https://imgur.com/a/2fRxpyo) (too loose and I don't want to jury rig it), was hoping to just be able to use that. \n\nWould like to have some system where I could just set it up and let it slowly filter a large amount over time. If I can do that I can always just fill my pack from that. Will have electricity.\n\nSuggestions welcome thanks y'all",

I use a 250 litre water butt with an inch or two of pea gravel in the bottom (this layer is solely to lift the actual filtering layers above the level of the outlet tap), about 3 inches of activated carbon (10kg bag), and about 3 inches of kids' playpen sand (thoroughly washed) on top of that.  I bought the grnaulated carbon but the pellets would have been better as sometimes a few granules excape out of the tap, but they sink to the bottom of whatever vessel I'm filling so not a huge issue.",

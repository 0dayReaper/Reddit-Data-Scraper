It's there basically for a growing chick to have air when they are preparing to hatch but haven't yet pierced the shell (there's a membrane that separates this air from the liquid of the egg). So an egg that stands up during a float test is getting old, one that floats is still probably edible but could have texture issues. \n\nRotten eggs sink just like fresh ones. The best way to tell is to sniff (you can smell it through the shell) or candle them, as they will be murky or even completely opaque whereas a good egg will be translucent with a fuzzy somewhat darker blob floating inside (the yolk). The yuck and bacteria actually infiltrate the air pocket so the egg sinks. Honestly though, if in doubt, double bag and toss. Them bitches are prone to popping and that stench and shrapnel are godawful.",

Not exactly equal, just pros and cons.",

Use a sharp flint, quartz or chert rock and practice making sparks. Afterwards use char cloth on top of the rock and get sparks to fall on the cloth, igniting it. It will glow red.\n\nPut this into a tinder bundle and blow it into flame. Practice repeatedly.\n\nYou have now learned 50% of the process. Next get a bow drill set and a hand drill set. Once you get a coal the rest you already know.\n\nGo easy at first and make a lot of low speed dust. Then go harder at higher speed and get smoke. You will have the coal shortly.\n\nThe more you practice the easier it will become. Then experiment with different kinds of wood. Enjoy the journey and keep your Bic dry.",

I don\u2019t say this to brag, just to demonstrate how much of bow drilling is muscle memory and how once it clicks for you it becomes quite easy.

I try to take my clients into nature as much as possible. \nI am sure you will learn so much about yourself and about the strength and humor of the kids you work with. I can\u2019t tell you how often friction fire making was the basis for my therapeutic relationship with clients, boys especially. \nThe Art of Mentoring (when it was held here in Ontario) changed my life. It\u2019s a 5 day nature connection event that is held in different regions all around the world.  Truly, tremendous work. The community in Vermont is perhaps one of the most solid in the world when it comes to nature mentoring. A few of the main instructors there would come to Ontario and share their wisdom. You\u2019ll meet lots of people who do the same work as you and rites of passage with youth. Check out the 8 Shields Institute and the book the Coyote\u2019s Guide. The coyotes guide might have lots of ideas for you about how to continue to spark the curiosity of your clients and give you some amazing ideas for games and activities out in the bush. \nI\u2019m very excited for you and the journey you\u2019re on!\nKeep your knife sharp and your tinder dry! ;-)",

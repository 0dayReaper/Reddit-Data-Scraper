I'm very allergic to dust mites, cats, and dogs, and some plant pollens. The shots have made it so I can actually let my pets sleep in the bed with me again. ( I have 3 cats and 2 dogs, yes I know but my allergies are less important to me than my animals). If you can make the commitment to the shots I highly recommend it. it's such a difference it's ridiculous.",

Not so much.\nIf you want to try and deal with this now, you could go to an allergist and start a regimen of shots to desensitize yourself.  The trick to desensitization is that you need shots, or to eat the allergen.  You wont get desensitized by normal exposure (mucus membranes) to the allergen.",

I used to have to carry an epipen everywhere and still had emergency room worthy allergy attacks a couple of times a month.  When my parents mowed the grass, I had to go to my aunt or grandma's house for the next 24 hours if I wanted to avoid the hospital. After 4 years of weekly shots, I was finally able to ditch the epipen, but I still require antihistamines unless I want to straight up suffer every day.",

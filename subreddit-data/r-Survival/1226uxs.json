I have long, very thick, dark hair, and it is a NIGHTMARE to find and remove ticks when I get them.\n\nMy absolute lifesaver has been Vet's Best, which is a natural oil based shampoo that's designed to be both a deterrent and to help release them when they are on you.\n\nIt also does wonders for overall bug repellent, and whether you choose a shampoo, or an oil to apply, etc. It will keep you from being prone to ending up with tick borne illnesses.",

If it won't hurt a baby duck it sure as shit won't hurt your pan.\n\nOn the other hand, it will strip all of the oil from a duck's feathers, even the naturally occurring ones that keep them warm and dry. So if you clean a baby (or adult!) duck with Dawn, it will sink if you put it in the water. They need a few weeks to regenerate the oily layer in their feathers.",

They are worried about it stripping the \"seasoning\" from the pan.\n\nOver time, the oils and therefore some of the flavors from everything rhats ever been cooked in that cast iron pan, builds up, and acts as a sort of natural \"non stick\" layer. It very much effects how things cook in said pan.  A properly seasoned (as in wiped out, not scrubbed) cast iron pan, is a pleasure to cook with. A freshly scrubbed one is not near as nice to use.\n\nAll you should really need to do is take a dry towel and wipe out whatever is left in the pan. Then the next time you heat it up, it will be sterilized from the heat, and you're good to go.\n\nBecause like you said, it will strip the oil right off it. And those oils are what you want to keep in your cast iron.",

But you *will* lose the seasoning. Maybe not all of it, but enough of it to need to re-season your pan.  And there is no real reason to use soap. So why?",

It makes no mention of reseasoning the pan, and essentially states it\u2019s unnecessary in a well seasoned pan. They do say they don\u2019t often use soap, preferring to scrub then heat. \n\nCouldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n\nRelevant parts\n\n&gt; Many sources explain that soap is OK because today\u2019s dish soap (like our favorite from Mrs. Meyer's) is gentler than it used to be. That may be true, but it\u2019s not really the point. Once your pan is well seasoned, a little dish soap isn\u2019t going to make a difference.\u00a0\n\n&gt;But: If I ever wanted to use a few drops of soap to break up and remove excess oil, I would. It wouldn\u2019t harm or strip the natural nonstick surface of my well-seasoned cast iron.",

I remember ticks being a big thing when I learned bushcraft 1) is knowing how to avoid thickets that might have ticks (prevention is key to survival) 2) is identifying a tick 3) is tick removal.. It's a painstaking process. You'll want tweezers and a steady hand (I've removed ticks from other people). If you remove them and the pincers remain, you risk local infection. \n\nI'm not a doctor. This is my learned medical experience",

Whenever I go hiking, I also tuck my (light colored, so you can see what's crawling on them) pant legs into my socks and sometimes tape the junction of the two. As soon as  I get done with my hike, I take off my boots, check for moving specks, unwrap the duct tape - and re-use it to remove the moving spots and specks. This also helps keep from spreading ticks from infested areas to ones that are not so bad. There are a lot of ticks in the areas around where I live and I don't like to use chemicals much, if I can get by without them. I have also thought about using double-sided (sticky on both sides) duct tape as above, so that maybe ticks will get stuck when they are trying to climb upwards from my boots and socks, but I haven't tried that yet. \n\nIt's an nearly constant battle and I appreciate others sharing their experiences and what has worked for them.",

These type of bacteria already exist in some cases, but the attempt is to avoid them being able to be common. Antibiotics are our main weapon against bacteria, and if they stop working, the outcome is scary. I\u2019ve heard of estimates saying that bacterial infections will have a higher mortality rate than cancer by 2050\u2019s",

By this point, you\u2019ve killed all but the hardiest, most antibiotic resistant bacteria in the colony that\u2019s causing your illness. This makes you feel way better, because the vast majority of the colony will be dead, leaving only a hardy minority. \n\nThe issue, though, is that bacteria breed by cloning themselves. If you stop taking your antibiotics early, then you don\u2019t continue to expose this hardy bacteria to more and more of an antibiotic. This means that, for the first time in five days, these bacteria get the chance to reproduce. As bacteria reproduce by cloning themselves, all of the offspring of those hardy, antibiotic resistant bacteria will have the same level of antibiotic resistance themselves.\n\nAs bacteria reproduce very quickly, within a couple of days, your infectious symptoms will be back. Worse, though, all of the bacteria causing that infection will have a high level of resistance to antibiotics as they will all be the offspring of those tough survivors from your course of antibiotics.\n\nCombine this process with the possibility for certain infections to be passed person-to-person and you end up with these resistant bacteria being spread to other hosts to breed and make more resistant bacteria colonies. \n\nAnd that, kids, is how I met your MRSA.",

I keep jases antibiotic kit around just in case i ever encounter that again, which includes the exact meds i have seen used for two seperate infections, and i am sure i can read up on the others when they get here. Despite whatever your point may be, it is sometimes beneficial for the public to have access to these meds without a doctor. I understand the possibility of abuse by idiots, but that does not mean we should let possible people in need die, or not be prepared to take care of your self in the scenario that medical infrastructure or supply lines fail. Hippocrates would roll in his grave if he knew how bad some people have it with insurance here in the US. If you take the time to educate yourself properly, there is nothing wrong with taking your own safety in your own hands.

            "comment": "Unfortunately antibiotic abuse has led to them being prescription only in the US; many people will take antibiotics if they've got a mild cold without logical reason, and it contributes significantly to resistance. There are countries where this isn't the case (yet). The promise of multiply resistant bacteria leading to pandemics is a realistic future we need to be prepared for (and in my opinion a more realistic one than a quick societal collapse). There's debate in the comments about shelf-life, but the reality is that antibiotics are very susceptible to breakdown. If they're stored appropriately, they're okay, but heat, light, and freeze/thaw cycles can cause degradation, and certain formulations are more shelf-stable than others. You also will need more than one and a comprehensive understanding of their efficacies and when to employ a new one if the first one isn't working; broad spectrum does not mean all spectrum, certain oral antibiotics are absorbed appropriately for X but not for Y, etc.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with your medical provider, they may be willing to prescribe medications for when/if SHTF. This good relationship includes them knowing you're responsible enough to not use the antibiotics inappropriately. When I traveled to areas with endemic water contamination and limited healthcare access, my provider gave me antibiotics just in case. There's a bevy of prescription medications I try to keep on hand for severe situations: prescription strength pain killers, prednisone, epinephrine, narcan, to name a few.",

Currently, I use it for when a client has \"dry skin\" between the toes that \"doesn't get better no matter how much lotion you use.\" Which is my long way of saying \"fungal infection\" without violating licensure. Often, they have already been to a doctor and it didn't help. Weekly manuka honey seems to fix the problem. \n\nI started using Manuka for cuts and stuff too. Works like a charm. \n\n\nAnd for those who have legal access to it - rick Simpson oil. It's a must have for cuts and burns. Especially burns. I used it on a bad 2nd degree burn after I touched a hot stove by accident. Within 15 minutes, I went from screaming in pain thinking I might be out of work a couple weeks to having full function of my hand, no pain, and was able to take a warm shower. Doesn't make you high when used that way either. Oh, and I had zero scarring afterwards. RSO should seriously be in every first aid kit and probably every burn unit too.",

Some last longer than others, google is your friend. \n\nNot all antibiotics treat everything? Print out a sheet with the protocol for each one, and carry one or two broad spectrum antibiotics. Follow protocol. \n\nAntibiotic resistance? Just follow protocol. Don\u2019t take for a head cold, finish the prescription, don\u2019t dispose of in a trash can. Easy. \n\nAnaphylaxis? Gimme a break. That\u2019s fear monger speak for severe allergic reaction. The kissing bug that bit me when I was camping without cell service can cause that. It\u2019s not common. If someone has a tendency towards severe allergies they probably already know it and carry an epipen. We\u2019re not talking about hillbilly joe taking fishmox every time he gets a cold, we\u2019re talking about engineer Steve taking cipro because he\u2019s been shitting blood for 2 days straight after eating a porcupine and medical care is weeks months or even years away. This is r/survival, not r/idiots. \n\nSome doctors even prescribe emergency antibiotics to keep on hand. That\u2019s what mine did. I carry some whenever I go camping in remote areas. Black plague is common here and could kill me before I get medical help. It can kill within a day or two of onset. Not everyone is within 24 hours of access to medical care, even in the 21st century. Many people don\u2019t realize how much wilderness there still is in this modern world. I\u2019m often several days from a hospital unless I press SOS on my garmin InReach, and I\u2019m not doing that if I can swallow some pills instead. \n\nFear monger strategies don\u2019t work too well in sex education and drug education in schools.

So you could even get the anabiotic correct and still not get better. \n\nAntibiotics are useful in the skills of a knowledgeable individual, but like most specialized items, they would be miss used without guidance. I understand if this is Reddit, but the amount of discourse that is purely incorrect on this post is staggering. Please don\u2019t take fish antibiotics. The shelf life on certain antibiotics is longer than you expect. Those suggesting certain oils mixed with herbs is nothing but quackery.\n\nEdit: Prescriber here.

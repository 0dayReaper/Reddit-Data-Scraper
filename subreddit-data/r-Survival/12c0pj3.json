Enough to have a couple doses before heading home or to a pharmacy to refill my purse stock \n- Tampons\n- Hand sanitizer\n- Pocket pack of tissues\n- Extra phone charger\n- Small nail clipper\n- Snacks (granola bars, usually, but I almost always have snacks of some kind)\n- Extra hair ties\n- Spare face mask \n- Pens \n\nFor reference this all fits into a small crossbody sized purse with room to spare and it's what I carry on the daily (and I'm also probably forgetting to list some things). Most everything I carry in my purse (things like clothing, shelter, food,  a small supply of water, LifeStraw, etc is in my car) could help keep me comfortable-ish for upwards of 72 hours of push came to shove. That's without grabbing my SHTF bag. Just me, my purse, and what I keep in my car.\n\nNow, if you're asking about my SHTF bag that's a whole different list that's still in the works! \n\nHope this helps!",

Which also helps explain why they're so problematic, the personal protection argument for allowing them is a false narrative.\n\nA hand gun, with a shorter barrel, or a shotgun, which is more effective at short range, is a much better personal protection gun.

It\u2019s based upon your personal opinion.   \n\nCompared to a handgun, an AR is easier to aim.  It has higher magazine capacity and is plenty lethal against human targets.    It has much less recoil than a shotgun.   \nAn AR provides a platform that the user can customize to lees their needs or desired purpose.    There are more options for different sights , scopes , lasers, magnifiers , grips   , slings that allow the user  modify an AR to meet their needs and wants.     Handguns and shotguns  don\u2019t have nearly as many options.  \n\nWith handguns Trained police officers miss their target more often than not in a gunfight.  These events usually happen at very close range. \nIt\u2019s difficult to fire accurately under extreme stress.   It is easier to aim a rifle ( AR etc) than a handgun.  \n\nIf one were forced to defend their property or life  from attackers more than about 20 yards away, am AR is without question a better weapon than a handgun",

I dont think you have ever fired a pistol do me a favor shoot a 556 rifle and then a pistol without plugs and tell me the differance the short barrel of the pistol makes it loud. And btw people use 556 rifles for home defence every day so what is your point here",

You should look into bushcraft, it's like survival but for fun and is more like what you're asking about. \n\nThe first thing you need to learn is first aid. So, start there. You'll probably have to spend a little money on some real [supplies](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/firstaid-kits.html) but first you need to learn how to use them. Check with your local fire department. They may offer a basic first aid class. \n\nIn your situation, being in the UK, you don't really need much more than that. You're never really going to be \"in the middle of nowhere\". \n\nThe second thing is being found. Do you have a mobile phone? Do you have a [whistle](https://www.amazon.com/Boundless-Voyage-Titanium-Emergency-Survival/dp/B099WSHBGK/ref=sr_1_12) or signaling device of some kind? Usually kept on your keychain. \n\nThird thing is staying warm/dry, so pack an [emergency survival poncho](https://www.amazon.com/PREPARED4X-Emergency-Blanket-Poncho-Activity/dp/B07TDGV37F/ref=sr_1_3?th=1) or something like that. This is also the place to point out that the clothing you choose is also part of your survival kit and very important. \n\nThat's really everything you need in your situation. First Aid, Signaling, Environmental Protection. It should all fit in a [hip bag](https://www.amazon.com/Bp-Vision-Outdoor-Camping-Waterproof/dp/B01GMTZNPY/ref=sr_1_21) (Or even just your pockets really). With maybe room left over for a protein bar or two.\n\nIf you want a little extra preparedness then maybe a small multitool. I believe the Gerber Dime is legal to carry in the UK, it's my favorite of the small multi tools. Also, a Bic lighter is the be all-end all of fire starting tools, but the chances you need something like that in your situation are diminishingly small. \n\nSo, for *survival* not recreation and in checklist form you should carry: \n\n    0. Phone/Wallet/Keys/Cash/ETC\n    1. Hip Pouch (to carry supplies)\n    2. First Aid Kit/Supplies\n    3. Emergency Whistle\n    4. Thermal Emergency Poncho\n    5. Water Bottle / Snack\n    6. Mini-Multitool\n    7. Bic Lighter\n\nAnd that's about it. You're not really traveling anywhere that's more than a day's walk from assistance. Your biggest worry is something like breaking a leg or getting a bad laceration. You don't really need things like food or water in your situation, that's mostly just for the psychological aspect. \n\nRemember, this is about a *survival* scenario, not recreational camping. Your goal is to stay safe and be found, not to goof off in the woods hunting squirrels and pigeons. If you were in the wilds of British Columbia, hours driving or days walking away from help, then we would be talking about a bigger backpack, fire starting kit, a sleeping bag, a tarp, stuff like that.",

Bored maybe, but ok. Some basic 1st aid items would help you deal with minor injuries.   \n    \nIn cold, wet weather you\u2019d need a warm sleeping mat, and a simple, lightweight tent too.   \nWith ready made shelter and insulation you save yourself a lot of hard work and give yourself the best chance of staying in good shape.    \n\nIf you were seriously injured or if it was unlikely that anyone would come looking for you, you\u2019d want to be able to call for help. A mobile phone (if there\u2019s signal) or a satellite beacon or messager where there isn\u2019t.  \n\nThe sleeping bag, tent and mat are quite bulky things to carry every day but if you were going into the middle of nowhere they\u2019re what you\u2019d want to have.",

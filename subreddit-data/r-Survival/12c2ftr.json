            "comment": "I traveled around Mexico, Central America, and South America, about 20 years ago.  If a local person tells you not to go to a certain place, or to turn around - listen to that person and turn around.  I went to an area where it was dangerous to go, and local women tried to tell me to turn around.   I didn't listen and I got mugged.  So, moral of the story - try to gain information about the area from local people when you go.  I'm talking about Oaxaca specifically, but I was also mugged in Bolivia one time as well.  Other tips: I got really sick in Bolivia from eating in a restaurant, but the street food was actually fine.  I also found it hard to stock up for camping because the stores were not stocked for it.   Bring a mosquito net and bug spray.  Local people would beg for things like asprin.  If you go to Mexico learn how to say: \"Can I pay that fine here, officer?\"   I hope you have fun-  I had a blast.",

Part of it may have been because I didn't know much about where I was and as I wandered around I passed through some sketchy areas.  So what I'm saying is, get as much info as you can.  I think this post might have been started to talk about the rainforest though, so I'll leave off commenting.",

Brazil  49,436\n2. USA 37,038\n\n\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f There have been 130 mass shootings already in the USA as of today April 8th 2023. \n\nGun violence is directly linked to gun ownership/availability. Since ex-army captain Bolsonaro became president in 2019, the number of registered gun owners in Brazil has more than quintupled, from 117,000 to 673,000. \n\nAlso the biggest year-over-year jump on record for gun sales was between 2019 and 2020, when a pandemic-related gun sales surge saw an unprecedented 40 million guns fly off the shelves (62 percent). (Pandemic demand likely explains the biggest year-over-year jump in imported firearms: 71 percent between 2019 and 2020.) \n\nYou are statistically more likely to be robbed, kidnapped, assaulted and murdered in the USA that Latin America. Even more so now than ever before in history because many Republican led states have allowed people to carry guns around without a license. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nMany Latin American countries depend on tourists for the majority of their income... So local petty criminals don't typically bother tourists... They only hurt and kill each other. It's well known that if you rob a tourist and create a bad experience for them... It could dramatically impact tourism money in that city and cause tremendous hardships for locals. \n\nSo a tourist is much safer walking in Mexico City than they are walking in Detroit. \n\n#themoreyouknow \ud83c\udf08",

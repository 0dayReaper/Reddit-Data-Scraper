In MN two years ago we had temps at negative 35 degrees for a week in January, people who\u2019s tanks were not at least 50% full we\u2019re having issues with enough gasified propane to be productive as it was nearing the point it was not boiling. \n\nThese stoves use white gas, a liquid that does well in almost all temps and does not require gasification. In cold temps if you let it out of the bottle unburned it will gasify immediately and can be concern for instant frostbite if you let it touch your bare skin.",

White gas (a.k.a. Coleman fuel, naptha) DOES require gasification and this is done by having the fuel  pass through the flames in a generator tube and boiling it before being sent to the jets.  \n\n1. The stove in the picture is not a naptha stove.  It is a compressed gas stove, using a mix of propane, butane, and isobutane.  75% of all compressed gas canisters [are made by the same manufacturer](https://adventuresinstoving.blogspot.com/2016/11/can-i-use-any-brand-of-gas-canister.html) regardless of brand.",

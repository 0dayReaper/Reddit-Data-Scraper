Many of us prepare to weather storms like natural disasters, extreme civil unrest, disruptions in the supply chain, and other severely disruptive (but not always deadly) incidents.

This way we actually thrive in situations short of the worst.  \n\nI agree with you that bugging out is the best approach for floods and tropical storms/hurricanes.

Yes, dude built a dock so he probably has/had a boat but navigating flood waters is risky. Second concern the sewers back up into the house. Yes, you've saved the structure. But that structure is now soaked in raw sewage teeming with hepatitis A-Z.\n\nThis is still really cool, I just hope the dude built the berm to hopefully protect the property and got the fuck out while the getting was good.",

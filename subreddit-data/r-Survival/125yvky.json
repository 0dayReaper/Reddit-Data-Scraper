Gave the pencil ms to a local school and keep the sharpeners. They Are very useful and you can actually remove the blade via a small set screw. I keep two of them in my hiking pack and my get home bag. Super handy for making shavings and sharpen a stick for cooking fish",

They take his pack and steal much of his belongings. Blessedly, these fools lacked the foresight and understanding to realize two crucial items use and neglected to take them: a toothbrush and snare wire.\n\nIn similar vein it is not out of the realm of possibility one of us could be subjected to forced theft of our gear; but it is likely that such a thief would miss the import of a simple dollar-store pencil sharpener.",

    "postText": "I want to test this on the next remote beach I visit. The issue is that many designs use materials that aren't actually available on the beaches that I've seen. The more commonly available stuff tends to be:\n\n- fishing gear\n- plastic bottles\n- TORN plastic bags\n\nThe plastic bottle method is very slow, but does it actually work at all? \nThe covered dug hole requires plastic sheeting that I've rarely seen available. \n\nI believe the key in any design is the differentiation of hot and cold. Thus, you can let a bottle sit in the blazing midday sun, but you need some shade to move the water to. That requires a tube, yet rarely seen tubing wash up on the beach. \n\nLikewise, heating water in metal over a fire is a much more reliable plan, but again, finding metal is a bit rare. \n\nThat said, I'll take a closer look on next beach trips.",

How much that is probably depends on how long you need to survive.\n\nAnyway... a shirt isn't the only way to filter water. On land you'd have more options, soil for example works really well. The more soil you run the water through the more salt you'd remove. Most harmful things in water need a surprisingly small soil filter to make the water safe to drink. Salt probably needs more, I'm not sure how much more but I imagine if a t-shirt removes enough (for a short term emergency) then you wouldn't need a massive soil filter to make seawater at least safe enough to survive off, if not taste great.\n\nAll you really need is a container full of soil with an opening at the top and bottom. Which you can make with clay (you will need to fire the clay, so it'll be a lot of work... but it can be done. A plastic bucket would definitely be less work).\n\nAlternatively, just dig a hole. This'd be a good short term solution.",

I got down 2' and got exhausted pretty quickly. \n\nSo, I had a look on YouTube and found a couple of examples of people digging holes like this. In one, (I forget the link), they used shovels and tools from 100's of years ago and needed to go deeper than head height. \nIn another, the guy dug in mud right next to a river. He then reinforced the sides of the hole with bark. That looked much easier. The hole filled pretty quickly. It only needed to be bailed about 3 times before it looked pretty clear. However, he still recommended boiling the water. \n\nI want to actually use this instead of buying bottled water at the beach, which is $5 for 2 liters. That's another immediate goal. \n\nSo, I'm going to go back to that beach and try 2 things:\n\n1) Go around the corner where I know there's a stream. I'll dig a hole by that and line it with an scrap plastic I can find, stones at the bottom. I'll test it with my lifestraw only. \n\nThen, I'll try the solar still _as well_:\n\n2) I found that glass bottles are actually more common than I first thought. I'll try heating one of those in a fire and catch the steam in a plastic bottle, washed in the sea. I'm confident to drink this direct. \n\nThen I'll also try another method, if I get time with the solar still. I found that plastic sheeting is rare on the beach in tact. However, I noticed that there's plenty on the seabed. If I can get some of that up, I'll dig a hole and try the solar still. \nLast time, the plastic material I found was too tough to cut with a bad knife. That was interesting. \n\nThere's quite a lot of details to actually work through. It seems easy, until it's not. \nGetting the hang of plastic is pretty useful. It burns toxic, but reliably as well.",

Because they're given food/vitamins/etc by the production team.\n\nIn a more realistic scenario you just wouldn't have enough energy to use a heavy tool like the Pulaski. Even carrying it would wear you down, let alone swinging it around.\n\nIt's a great tool for all kinds of tasks but I'd probably ditch it immediately in a survival situation (maybe after building a shelter... but even then I'd minimise my use of the tool).",

In a short term wilderness survival scenario you won't be needing to feed huge open campfires, or build a big fancy long term shelter. An axe's only real advantage over a knife is the ease of processing large amounts of firewood, primarily felling and splitting. For the purposes of survival (warmth, boiling/cooking, signalling) you won't ever need a massive open fire. I can just harvest wrist thick and smaller dry wood to build small controlled fires. And if I were lucky enough to catch or kill any small game or fish I wouldn't dare try to butcher it with an axe or a kukri/machete. And doing fine work, like trigger mechanisms for traps, would be much more difficult using an axe or a larger blade. \n\nMaybe survival influencers and personalities on youtube and TV prefer the big flashy knifes, but any real career woodsman like survivalists, bushcrafters, hunters and fishers basically all carry small blades, generally 3-5 inches useable length.",

It's unsafe both ways, impractical, and makes the tool way less useful.",

You could pair it with a good knife and be much better off.\n\n\nIf I have to have gloves good enough to push against a blade that I have sharpened to use a saw, then there's absolutely no possibility that using a good, dedicated saw isn't way better, more efficient and especially safer.\n\nAlso adds wear and tear to gloves (are you using cutting-gloves?) which I prefer not to wear in warmer months anyway.\n\nI mean, do you, friend!

Trying to find some way to circle around is a great way to get lost especially if you have can't see further than several feet due to all the trees.\n\nA friend of mine got lost walking his dog once - a 13 hour search and rescue team found him a few hundred paces from his home. He'd been stuck there close to 20 hours unable to find a way out and with no water.\n\nWith a large knife, you can cut a straight line in the direction you think is right and hopefully you are right (if you're not, at least you'll have the path you cut through to serve as a reference point as well as something the search and rescue team can find).",

Imagine a tight cluster of fishing lines hanging (not line, lines) with a hook every few millimetres between you and safety. An axe edge profile is too steep to slice through reliably.

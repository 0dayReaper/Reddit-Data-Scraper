After sawing down a dead pine with shitty saw and splitting it with even shittier axe, I made the most delicious campfire burgers and fed my dog a nice piece of steak. \n\nIt snowed during the night and our shelter got covered but I stayed warm in my new sleeping bag. I tried to keep the fire going all night long, but I fell asleep and slept till 5am so when I wake up, fire was long gone. \n\nAlso, my dog went crazy because we spotted a deer nearby - Here's a [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHEhEhtHY6s&amp;t=715s) of our whole ordeal (If it's not allowed, I'll delete the link!)",

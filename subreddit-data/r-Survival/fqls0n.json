Low, sloped walls work best. \n\nExtreme heat, large shade area and ventilation are important. \n\nHeavy weather coming from a primary direction? A strongly sloped wall facing the weather will offer the most shelter.",

In case of precipitation, it is ideal to go for the \u201chighest\u201d ground of an area that ideally has a grassy base. You want to avoid dirt, low regions, and areas which look especially prone to drainage (look up an alluvial fan to see a large scale example of what to avoid in a campsite). There\u2019s obviously exceptions, e.g. at altitude where you\u2019re trying to avoid harming the fragile and slow growing plants, but for much of the terrain this thought will serve you well.",

The following week after midnight, when I returned to my camp, I found my shelter completely destroyed. I quickly rebuilt it and went to sleep. The next morning I found my ground sheet invested with maggots, they were literally everywhere. They would crawl really fast especially at night when they became active. They would then crawl up the sides of my tarp and collect around the ridge line, where they would form some kind of massive ball that would move around. When I woke up I found maggots between my sleeping bag and air mattress. I quickly realized that they were falling from above during the night. That week I cleaned my shelter at least three times a day, but somehow they would always manage to crawl back inside. Eventually I gave up, I threw out my ground sheet, air matrass and decided to just accept to presence of the maggots. This is nature and they would do me no harm, right? I accepted the situation and continued sharing my shelter with the lovely maggots. Then one morning when I woke up and looked around to see how the maggots were doing and quickly realized that they were all gone.. They were gone and haven't returned since and so did my mysophobia..",

Want something super strong, works well with knots and is spliceable? There are so many variations of cordage nowadays that paracord might as well be dental floss.

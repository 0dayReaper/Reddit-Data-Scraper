Start small.. go comping with friends or something and start remembering what you didn\u2019t know how to do or something and spend your off time learning more. \n\nEveryone should have basic survival instincts. Getting yourself clean water may be one of the more important ones.. it\u2019s where I\u2019d start. You can camp somewhere with fresh water sources and learn about them and how to clean it to be safe. Once you have that skillset of finding water you\u2019re almost set honestly.. now you bought yourself weeks or even months to find food and shelter and start something. \n\nYou will get to a point where you aren\u2019t just finding water sources.. you\u2019re noticing the land around it has good soil so you can actually plant some food here. Then you\u2019ll learn about animals eating your food.. and the wheel keeps turning lol. \n\nI got to learn most of this as a kid in the woods for two years and that was a looong time ago but.. I still remember all of it and stuff afterwards. It\u2019s invaluable but not really til it\u2019s muscle memory. Godspeed my guy \ud83e\udee1\ud83d\udd96\ud83c\udffb",

Storing food and bugging in or bugging out. Look up weather and how you\u2019d deal with whatever your area has. How would you handle a tornado? Would you help your neighbors? Urban survival is also dealing with looters and violent people.\n\nYouTube would be number one for information. \n\nFigure out what you\u2019re more concerned about, then come back with better questions. If you\u2019re not worried about wilderness survival, you can still go camping and practice it because it\u2019s still useful. \n\nYou like to be hands on, then buy stuff for bugging out and start walking around your neighborhood. Get some paper maps and find a route into or out of your neighborhood if something happens.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of folks in Texas that are into bushcraft and survival. Survivalistboards.com is a good resource.\n\nEdit: I just remembered. In the HBO show \u201cthe last of us,\u201d it shows that they live in a cul de sac. The first few episodes were great where it shows the exact start of the break down. People are confused about what\u2019s happening and do some weird stupid things that don\u2019t make sense to the viewer because we know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve never played the video game. The watch repair people are hearing the news on the radio about their home country and kick the girl out. The dad comes back in a hurry and rushes the girl out. But they went to downtown? Why?!! No!! Stay out of city centers!! He made the same mistake in Kansas City. But if they had each had go bags in the front closet with a few days of snacks and some clothes, they would have been pretty well off to start. The initial situation is where most will die.

Riots don\u2019t normally reach suburban areas. If you\u2019re in an area that riots would reach, figure out a quick getaway or more security. \n\nWhen you park, always think about how you\u2019re going to leave. Don\u2019t park front in, back into spots. Back into your garage. Always be ready to hop in and go. Keep your gas topped up. Keep your bug out bag ready and near the front door. \n\nMost storms, you could probably stay at home. So prepare by stocking up on food and necessities. Look at the covid stuff for inspiration. Be ready to stay home for at least two weeks. If your home could flood, bug out. Plan a few different routes out of town. Plan for traffic backups on major routes. \n\nPeople who prepare for society to collapse are dumb. Our society won\u2019t collapse. If america \u201ccollapses\u201d or falls into civil war, our world is done and 70% of Americans would die within six months. So you don\u2019t really have to worry about war.

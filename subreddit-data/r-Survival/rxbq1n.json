            "comment": "Keep a pair or large nails in a chest pocket with a wrist strap tied to each. Great ice picks in a pinch..\n\nBe sure to keep a dry set of clothes and a couple towels nearby. If hiking, put the clothes in a dry bag. You'll have to strip naked to dry off with the towels, but you can change clothes within a couple minutes. Depending on how long you are in the water, you might not be out of danger without fire, shelter, and food but dry clothes will at least buy you time.\n\nAnother trick is DON'T use a backpack. Everything on you should either float or be easily removed. If you go through, the last thing you want is 30lbs of valuable gear that will either drown you or you'll be forced to jettison and let it sink under the ice. A sled that you pull behind you is far safer because your supplies will be dry and it distributes all that extra weight on a wider area several feet behind you. If you fall in, the sled will likely still be there.\n\nSkis can be a great help. Some skis will float, meaning you won't lose them if you go through.  Pulling them out of your hole, the skis can either be crossed over eachother, giving you a large X to hold onto or one ski can be used in each hand forming an H pattern to distribute weight over a wider area.\n\nOnce out and changed into dry clothes, don't stop moving until you reach shelter. Your body temperature begins dropping immediately but movement can slow, stop, or reverse falling temperatures.\n\nFalling through ice is a great fear, but really it's only as much of an emergency as you make of it. Panic and you'll die without help. Prepare ahead of time, and staying calm will make falling through an inconvenience.",

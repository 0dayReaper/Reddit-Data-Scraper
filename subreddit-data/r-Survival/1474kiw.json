I work for an anti-theft bag company - I used their shears to test some of our cut-resistant fabrics.\n\nThe pruners literally cross over themselves and stop, creating a notch.  IDK if it's from a warped anvil/blade?  I've had it happen 3x.\n\nWouldn't be a big issue if they just warranty-replace.  Four weeks to reply is insane.",

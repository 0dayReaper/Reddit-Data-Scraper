However there were alot of circumstances that led to this tragedy. She was known for getting disoriented easily, didn\u2019t have good compass\\map knowledge, never should\u2019ve been alone. Her hilke partner left and was not comfortable leaving her on the AT, Gerry insisted she would be okay. Her husband was supporting her hike since she couldn\u2019t carry that much gear so was unprepared for a long stay in the woods. She also gave up after 14 days. Granted if she didn\u2019t have water that was\u2019t too bad. The dogs couldn\u2019t find her due to heavy rains. Had she even gone in a circle around her campsite rubbing the trees with her hands they might have found her. Dogs can air scent a long ways and her scent would last longer under tree cover. \nThey were 100 yrds from her camp 3x \nYes if you do not get found after a few days start doing forays. (Walking out 100-150 yrds on a compass point) then walk back, do not leave sight of your camp. Blaze a trail on the trees, pile up stones, set a log crossways on another log, touch bushes and trees. Leave a note or piece of fabric on a small branch.  Then follow your compass back bearing back to your camp. \nYou mentioned a plane crash. That crash site will have searchers in hours. Unless your life is at immediate risk, stay there. Use your judgement, its life over limb. Aron Rolston cut his arm off with a dull pocket knife to self rescue. Incredible story.",

In the event where you have no choice but to go in search of water or shelter, leaving a trail of some sort is obviously a smart thing to do.\n\nWhere this guy was lost, there's very little vegetation, it's basically desert, and the sun is brutal, even at this time of year. It would also be decently cold at night. It was much smarter for him to go in search of shelter rather than just sitting in the open.\n\nI think staying put is the best advice, but only up to a point.",

And she was a pretty experienced hiker, 1000 miles into her AT thru-hike. She survived for *26 days* before dying.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/hiker-who-went-missing-on-appalachian-trail-survived-26-days-before-dying\n\nThis part is a cautionary tale:\n\n&gt; The campsite was \u201cdifficult to see unless you were right next to it\u201d, Adam wrote, noting that the tent was under several large trees whose branches obstructed the sky.\n\n...\n\n&gt; There was also evidence of lost opportunities: an open canopy nearby where she could have been seen from the sky, had her tent been under it.\n\n...\n\n&gt; The camp was less than two miles from the Appalachian trail. Adam wrote that walking south from the campsite, the dense forest became open woods with good visibility after 60-70 yards, and after another 25 minutes he found \u201ca clear logging road\u201d that led to lodging. In total the walk took about 30 minutes.\n\nSo the advice to \"stay where you are\" isn't great if you are in dense forest and can't be seen from the air.",

If you hike between the highway and the mountains, you can walk downhill to find water, and follow the water to find the highway. It would probably be a only a few hours walk - maybe a day with a leg injury.\n\n&gt; The further you get from your last known location the harder it will be to find and rescue you.\n\nOften rescuers don't have a \"last known location\" to work with. So they might never find you if you stay where you are.\n\nUltimately it comes down to are you going to help yourself, or wait for someone else to help you? I personally prefer the first option.",

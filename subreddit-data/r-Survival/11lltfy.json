I'm only going on what others have said in here and the items I have seen advertised, on video, and in pics.\n    In attempting to head him off from signing up for one so he can avoid a mix of crap and perhaps even something decent and so he can get his money's worth of high quality items by doing the research and shopping for himself instead of letting someone else do it and charge extra, I did do that, unsolicited. \n   The Reason there are numerous responses similar to mine is that is the general consensus on those subscription boxes, so appreciated or not, it's people trying to help out, even if done in a snarky way, because..... like not doing the research on the boxes, he also didn't research on how many times in the past a question like his has been asked here and answered here, which is easy enough to do.  It's like someone asking what the best way to climb Everest in only your underwear is. You either let them fail or try to persuade them against it, unsolicited, and not directly answering their question. Sometimes it seems insulting but a bit of research can go a long way.",

This dude asked a simple question and rather than move along because you don't like the question, you (and many others) decided to impose your opinions on him. \n\nYou have no idea what his background is or what he knows. He might outclass you in every single way when it comes to survival knowledge but because you don't like his question, you assumed you know better than him and you let him know.\n\nThat's what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about your motives, knowledge, or desire to save people from terrible underwear on Everest analogies. People like you are why it's difficult for some to feel comfortable posting here. Instead of helping him with his question in a way that he can learn from, you have effectively shut him down, as is evident by his lack of response to anyone on his own post. Your self righteous need to hurry up and give unsolicited advice among a cacophony of others doing the same led to a total missed opportunity to make an impact in this person's life.

It's unlikely he has more survival experience than me because he asked that question and because I started getting survival training in the 60's. If only getting advice that is what you want to hear or promotes your existing idea, life is going to be tough, snowflake. Bear with it and learn something of value. If we collectively don't like the question, it may be because the question wasn't thought through enough, like \"should we gargle bleach for covid 19?\"  Nothing is preventing him from responding but himself. It could still be an interactive learning experience despite any offputting responses, but like actual wilderness survival, having a thick skin can help. He can laugh along with us like a bunch of guys around the campfire trading stories, insults, good advice, etc., or slink off into the woods..... hopefully not with his ninjamall survival junk.... better his ripoff, overpriced, otherperson shopped, decent gear trickled to him over months as he is led down a pricey trail by his wallet. If he paid attention and read between the sarcastic lines, as guys often use, he surely would learn. This is How Men have Exchanged Wisdom through the Ages.  It must be hard acting so maturely..... with a name like Darthbuttnugget. Take a chill pill.",

There's almost always a little bonus item or two. I love that most, if not every, box includes a project too, so it isn't just a box of stuff that goes on the shelf. You have something to dig into right away. I probably have 5-6 things I use every day from these boxes and I'm just a normal dude in an office 5-6 days a week. The rest is in our camping gear or my \"adventure\" toolboxes.",

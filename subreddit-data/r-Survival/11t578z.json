    "postText": "I was on a walk alone (young female) with my three dogs (one is a senior, but all are large dogs) on my property in North Arizona. The area is pretty remote but there are some other people nearby. I was on the phone with my friend (probably a mistake) with my dogs walking ahead of me. We were walking on the main dirt road. To the right are a bunch of desert trees, bushes etc. not more than 10 feet from the road. I heard an extremely loud growl and saw something massive jump from the tree and run further away from us. My idiot dogs luckily did not sense a damn thing, because I know they would have chased it. I am positive it was a mountain lion with how huge it was (bigger than my German shepherd) and the growl sounded nothing like a wolf or anything else. I was alone so I called my boyfriend who came running with a gun from the house, while I immediately snatched the dogs by the collar and held them with me.\n\nMy guess is he was watching us from the bushes, and he didn\u2019t expect us to walk closer. He heard me and the dogs being loud and I assume he growled to try to scare us off then ran away? Does this sound right?\n\nHow should I operate from now on? Should I be careful around my property? Will it come back? Why did it growl? \n\nThank you. Scariest experience of my life . It was massive",

            "comment": "I think you acted fine. It probably climbed the tree when it heard you and the dogs, then gave a warning and bolted when you got too close. It probably wanted fuck-all to do with a human and three large dogs. Hunters use dogs to force them up into trees so that they can be shot. It's super rare for them to attack people, you're more likely to be struck by lightening than killed by a cat.\n\nIf you're afraid, keep the dogs close when you're walking. Just keep them on a tight leash so that nobody gets hurt if you run into it again.",

A hunting cougar attacks from behind, and likes the surprise. Bear spray can halt them. If they are staring straight at you, and appear to not be backing down, an attack is quite possible too. The usual advice is to wave your arms up , shouting loudly , and backing away while maintaining eye contact. Yes, they are having a staring contest, and looking away is \u201csubmissive\u201d. Generally, make noise when walking, such as singing, and keep your eyes and ears aware for movement or rustling. Little bit trickier in your case with three dogs, but holding them back was a good idea. The animal, if he attacks, would most likely go for a dog.",

With the spray you can cover a much larger area, and the cat will likely realize you\u2019re not worth it. A gun will permanently hurt them, but it would take a great shot to take one down right away. \n\nIf you have property you can definitely take a few practice shots with the bear spray to get used to it. Careful with it around your doggies, and yourself. It\u2019s strong and depending on the wind and other things it can get in your eyes and mouth a bit as well. You should try using the bear spray in practice before using it against anything that you think is trying to hurt you.",

They don't want anything from you, and won't be bothering you unless for some reason they've identified one of your dogs as a food source.\n\nI wouldn't be letting my dogs out in the bush around Flagstaff, or Northern Arizona, unattended if theres a Cougar around - theres always the chance it decides that a smaller dog is food - but generally they have absolutely NO interest in harming, or being around people, or big dogs.\n\nYou are 100% safe. Don't worry about a passing Cougar... in the very, very, very small likelihood it attacks you, you fight back and it will move on. They are opportunistic predators not looking for a fight with a strange monkey.\n\nKeep an eye on your dogs. Living in Northern AZ comes with all sorts of natural dangers. I would be much more worried about rattle snakes killing my dog than a Cougar. If you have a fenced yard and a doggy door I'm sure they'll be fine - just keep an eye on them. Don't be locking your dogs outside in the country overnight.\n\nThese are large, old, country dogs, which tells me they have the wits/training to avoid most danger. Cougars do not want to fuck with dogs, they occasionally will... but 99% percent of the time its Dogs chasing a cougar up a tree so hunters can shoot it.",

Make noise and make yourself look big, also don't turn away from the cougar or where you think it went. \n\n* Keep pets and kids close, cats will avoid challenging prey.\n* They will hunt solo or smaller dogs, and even will go after them over things like sheep (we saw this on our ranch). Just make sure if your dogs are outside, that they are all together, ideally in more of a kennel or well lit area. We had  a yard light that they didn't seem to like to come into and would try to lure our dogs outside of the picket fence. \n* Bear spray is great and effective, just make sure it's actual bear spray like Counter Assault or Frontiersman, not a self-defense spray. Also good for moose and rattle snakes according to our Fish &amp; Game in Montana. It's also super easy to carry and lightweight. There's a ton of myths around it, just read up on how to use it from one of the manufacturers.\n* Be aware of your surroundings, especially your back trail, cats are ambush predators.\n* If attacked, fight back with whatever you got. This isn't like a griz, don't play dead.",

They\u2019re mostly active dusk and dawn so those are times to make sure your dogs are on a leash (if not always). \n\nSetting up an emergency recall for your dogs can help. This means picking a unique word for emergencies and a high reward treat like chicken breast and 3 times a day, say the word and give a treat. Break it into little pieces so your dogs think they\u2019re getting a lot of treats. Start easy where they\u2019re right next to you or paying attention to you until they understand what the word means and then you can do it when they\u2019re not paying attention to you. Use a regular recall with their name when they\u2019re outside or when you don\u2019t know for sure they\u2019ll come when called. Then use the emergency word in an actual emergency. Screaming and running away is also a good way to get your dogs to follow you in an emergency. Javalinas and coyotes are also potentially dangerous to dogs, as are rattlesnakes so a really good recall is always a good idea.",

Lions are ambush predators, so turn around and keep an eye at your 6 periodically and above you on trees, hills, or small cliffs. A gun or bear spray won\u2019t help if the lion lands on your neck.\n- Always better to hike with someone else, 2 armed adults and 2-3 big dogs is a pretty formidable pack. Humans and dogs are pack animals, utilize your pack. \n- The eyes in the back of your pack is supposed to work, don\u2019t know.",

The more face-like the better.\nHave an easily accessible snub revolver. If that bitch gets the jump on you, she\u2019ll try to pin and suffocate you with her mouth over yours. That\u2019s how cats like to kill. \nDumping all five rounds at point blank from a snub revolver might save you or at least take her down with you. The short barrel makes it easier to get clearance and will always fire, whereas a semi-auto will potentially not fire if the barrel is being depressed in the struggle. Don\u2019t worry about large calibers, I\u2019d just get a .38 special. With that short of distance and from a snub the difference in ballistics is negligible. I wouldn\u2019t go smaller than .38.\nPlus it\u2019s a loud noise maker and that may just scare the cat off immediately. \nYou can bring spray, but it\u2019s bulky to carry and requires careful consideration before deploying which can be difficult with adrenaline distorting rationale thinking. \nIf the situation is right for deployment, spray is superior to a firearm. If the situation is wrong for deployment, you just seasoned the cat\u2019s dinner.\nA whistle isn\u2019t a bad idea either, as well a tourniquet.\nBe confident, be the predator, you are the apex not the cat.",

I've been as close as 6' from a cougar. It looked past me, down the trail. It looked up the trail, then it did a double take looking AT me. I just went \"BOO\" and it must have jumped 30' straight ahead and hit the ground running. I've had them watch me hiking by as they licked their paws, sitting in the rocks looking down on me many times. They taste good if made into kitty pepperoni sticks too!",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question but here we go, I have been wanting to start hiking for years now. What stops me? I am a woman, and I would like to go alone, and women will understand, it is scary. And I mean, I am afraid to encounter a group of men scary, not I need some dude to help me scary. \n\nEvery woman I have asked about this to says they simply don't go hiking alone. But I work crazy hours, and have a crazy schedule, and I have not been able to find a group I could go with.\n\nSo, my question is, what are your ideas as to how I could go alone and protect myself.\n\nEdit: I live in Guatemala, comments suggested me to add that to the post.\n\n\nThank you!",

Here's what I'd recommend/what I carried: \n\n- whistle \n- an emergency contact unit if there's no cell service there (I had something that was similar to a gps/pager that let me send emails in limited service but would send an alert to emergency personnel if something really bad happened. Like life or death situation)\n- tell someone where you are going\n- bear or pepper spray \n- weapon, if allowed. I live in the US so I always went out with a revolver and a knife just in case \n\nI also carried other emergency gear on my vest (flares, matches, etc.) but honestly if you're hiking on standard trails you'll probably be fine going alone. I'd suggest at least the whistle and bear spray :) both are cheap and effective deterrent against either animal or human",

            "comment": "Solo female hiker here.  I'm in North Georgia, Western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina mostly. \n\nJust do it!  Seriously, just get out there and do it.  \n\nI started out with some worries - sometimes forest service roads are really sketchy in my area, there are predator animals in my area, on occasion I've run across a suspect dude or two.  But generally speaking, you are VERY safe on trail.  It is a fact that you are more likely to die or get seriously injured in a car accident within 5 miles of your home than you are to suffer the same fate on a trail.  \n\nTrail peeps (both hikers and mtn. bikers) are great folks.  You are also more likely to find someone who is willing to help you through something than you are to find someone with nefarious intent.  I've had a mtn. biker literally ride 2 miles back to me to make sure I got out after meeting up with him at a waterfall and us both expressing that we weren't sure how to get back to our cars.  \n\nOnce you've done this a few times, you will find that instead of being fearful, you are feeling empowered and strong, independent and resourceful.  It is, quite honestly, a fantastic feeling to be solo in the forest.  It is great self-care that I highly recommend. \n\nSome tips to ease your mind:  \n\n1. If you are comfortable and confident with one, feel free to carry a gun.  Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't, it mostly depends on where I'll be.  If I am overnight camping (yes, I also do this solo, and not in \"campgrounds\", but in dispersed, no amenities forest service sites) I always have a gun - nighttime critters are a little more scary than daytime ones because you can't see them.\n2. Take supplies with you:  you'll need to have plenty of water, some snacks, a whistle can be handy for calling others when you need help.  I take along flagging tape for those times when I'm off-trail trekking so that I can be sure I find my way back.  \n3. Always let someone know where you are going and what time you expect to be back.  Have a planned time that you are to contact that person and if they haven't heard from you by your deadline, they are to call in the cavalry.  \n4. Download the Gaia GPS app into your phone.  It will track you as you hike and you can see yourself on the map.  This app works whether you've got service or not.  It can save you from making a wrong turn.\n5. If finances allow and it eases your mind, buy yourself a Garmin Inreach Mini.  It is a satellite communicator/locater with an SOS button.  No matter where you are, if you press that button, someone will come for you.  It might not be immediate, as most trail rescues are pretty involved, but they will come for you.",

To find trails I want to hike and to track myself while I'm hiking I use the Gaia GPS app.  It's easier than the others I've tried, the map is more visually appealing to me than others I've tried, it stores all of my hikes in a manageable way, has good features that I use regularly to plot things out to determine distance/elevation change,  it's free and I've never had it fail me.

It let me not just plot out a safe path but also orient myself and track where I was going. Add a compass and I was set. Personally, going to remote locations I only ever saw my coworker or loggers on rare occasions. I would just steer clear for multiple safety reasons.",

Especially not while hiking.\n\nMaybe you misunderstand the charge level indicators, or those indicators are innaccurate, or you deluded yourself another way.. But what you are describing did not happen.\n\nHere's an experiment: Fully drain that battery pack, by charging your phone or other devices until you can't get any more power out of it. Then keep it inside of a drawer, and take it with you the next time you go hiking. Then see how much you can charge your phone over the course of the day, or how much you can charge your phone at the end of the day.   \nThe result will be that you will get very little if any charge from that gadget. I'd be surprised if you can even get 10% from it at the end of the day.\n\nI have nothing against solar panels, and in some situations they are practical, if you choose the right equipment. I have sold a bunch of portable solar panels when I worked at REI, and I've worked for companies that installed solar panels in buildings.    \nBut most people don't understand the capabilities and practical limitations of small solar panels. It doesn't help that most of the marketing is extremely dishonest and misleading. \n\nThe small solar panels that are combined with battery packs are nothing more than marketing gimmicks. They are too small to keep up with a battery pack that charges a single cell phone, even when kept stationary, angled properly, in full unshaded sunlight. Something like a 7-watt panel is the bare minimum under such ideal conditions, and the panels built into battery packs are a small fraction of that. Pretty much any panel that is small enough that it doesn't fold is going to be too small. Especially with some $30 knockoff you're buying on Amazon. \n\nAnd when you're strapping a panel to your backpack while hiking, especially in a forest, you're getting only a very small fraction of the power that panel could produce under ideal conditions. Even a 20 watt panel wouldn't help much when used in that way.\n\nPerhaps in a desert island scenario, when you can leave that battery pack in full sun all day, and even charging your phone 10% per day (if it's turned off and not being used) is valuable to you, sure that panel would be nice to have. But that's not a scenario any of us will ever be in.\n\nSo yes, you are dreaming or deluding yourself. I'm not trying to be mean, but that's just the truth, and I think you're better off knowing the truth.    \n\nFor one thing, that panel is a waste of weight and money for hiking purposes, and you're wasting time and effort trying to get a charge from that panel. You're much better off getting a reliable battery pack, and maybe a larger one, than carrying a solar panel.   \n\nAnd in situations where a solar panel could be practical- say camping for a week in the desert- you're much better off carrying a larger one, say a 20 watt panel, with a separate battery pack, or ideally two battery packs so you can swap them out and keep one charging while the other is in use.  \nA battery pack built into the panel (or vice versa) is a terrible idea in my opinion. Not only is it less versatile, but that battery pack has a much shorter lifespan than the solar panel, it wears out with every usage. So eventually you'll be stuck with a perfectly good solar panel that is weighed down with a useless battery.",

There are more people in the city than in the woods. \u201cFeeling safe\u201d (from attack) is mostly about helping yourself FEEL safe (self-soothing). I get it, it IS scary. So dealing with that often means reminding yourself about who/what actually pose the biggest threat to you (unfortunately, that\u2019s your partner, family, and friends, not a stranger in the woods). Our sense of risk gets skewed, because the occasional sensational (and tragic) \u2018maniac attacking woman in the woods\u2019 story gets over-reported in the news compared with the much more frequent (and also tragic) \u2018boyfriend murders woman with her own gun.\u2019\n\nBeing prepared for handling a broken ankle by yourself because no one else is around, is more of a legit safety concern about hiking alone, than running into someone scary. Again, not to belittle the fear, but to put it into perspective. Be more concerned about making sure you have the supplies needed to care for yourself (water, food, first aid, whistle, etc., in case you had to spend the night outside alone, and telling someone where you\u2019re going and when you should be back). Beyond that, with a knife and pepper spray for protection from humans and other animals, you should be set.\n\nI\u2019ll probably get downvoted like crazy. But if you don\u2019t already own a gun, I think solo hikes are probably not a good reason to go buy one. I\u2019ve never wished I had one on a hike, none of my female friends (outside Alaska) bring them hiking, and have never had an issue that one would have fixed.",

While I'm not a fan of how much busier the nature areas are out here,  there are very few things to be frightened of. \n\nBeing safe is almost 99% situational awareness and self conduct. Pay attention to the people around you and interact with them appropriately. You are VERY unlikely to be approached by a group of people in the wilderness. In my anecdotal opinion,  the more likely scenario for human- related danger are single men who are both acting like they are avoiding people but are staying relatively close to groups without being a part of them. \n\nI'm a hermit hiker. I avoid groups as much as possible,  but I'll say 'hi' and make eye contact when I'm around them.  People who avoid speaking and avoid eye contact are what set my alarms off most of the time. Pay attention,  interact with people,  and don't act like easy prey. \n\nI've never felt the need to carry a weapon with me beyond bear spray and one time an air horn for mountain lion prints I saw the day before. \n\nIf you want to both get anxiety and tips for situational awareness, I recommend the book \"the gift if fear\" by Gavin DeBecker. It'll make you feel a bit paranoid about all men ever but it will also help you examine your own responses, anxieties, and help you reflect on how to prepare yourself in the event of the worst case scenario. \n\nIt may also help you feel more confident about your choices and the more realistic probabilities of danger around you as opposed to some non-descript concern about groups of men in the woods. \n\nApologies if this came off as lecturing, I hope this is useful advice and alleviates your anxiety a bit.",

If you normally carry in your every-day life - then carrying on the trail is no big deal. If you are new to firearms - getting geared up to 'be safe on the trail' is a bigger hurdle.     \n\nLaws prevent carrying a firearm in some park areas. If you are hiking between states - it becomes even more complicated. Open vs. concealed carry is also important to figure out where you live/hike.     \n\nWhere to carry is another complication. It can't be inside the backpack - as it won't be available when you need it. Hip belts on packs will interfere with a belt holster. Chest carry is probably most common/practical - but that gets in the way and is hot. \n\nSecure storage is also complicated. This is more important for overnight trips in tents - but day hikes sometimes too. If you need to drop pack and poop - you'll have to keep that gun on you. If you want to jump into an alpine lake - where does the gun go? Generally - being forced to be in contact with the gun for the entire wilderness adventure is annoying. \n\nIt's heavy. Hikers and more specifically backpackers go to great lengths to save weight in their backpack. Carrying an unnecessary 2+ pounds is not something I recommend. \n\nPersonal bit: when other hikers see someone carrying a gun - they avoid that person. If you expect any type of social interactions on the trail - they will be limited with an open carry. You could miss out on important trail beta or other help. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy general recommendation is for scared hikers to carry bear spray, not a gun. Most experienced hikers don't carry guns (with the exception of places like Alaska where brown bears a real threat). I've hiked thousands of miles all across the USA and internationally. I've never carried a gun. I've never felt the need for one. \n\n**I totally understand that others disagree with my recommendation. That's totally fine. I realize that there are people who hike with guns in a safe and legal way.**",

Bear spray is also highly effective, though you need to be aware of the wind. For personal protection, anything you have that can keep trouble from putting hands or paws on you is best.

People who are on the hiking trails / camping in general are not the aggressive type. Bump into someone random at REI and you will see what I mean\n2. Being prepared with proper gear and supplies. Med kit/boo boo kit, water, snacks, map/gps, weather layers, fire tools, and let someone know where you are going/rough itinerary \n3. Self defense tools. These should be on your hip/shoulder strap/belt, wherever you can immediately grab. Camping/bushcraft knife, Bear Mace, and a gun. Any or all 3 of these (with proper training and knowledge of how to use) are good to have. \"better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it\" Keeping them on the \"outside\" of your kit ensures that you can grab them immediately as needed vs digging through your pack and it lets everyone know you are prepared for virtually anything.\n   1. just to note, yes this is contradictory to \"concealed carry basics\" where you do not want others to know you are carrying. Two different environments mandate different solutions\n4. A large fully trained dog is hard to beat, however your average ausie shepard that is on the trail is pretty much only good to distract the bear or mountain lion while you get away. Barks scare away most animals, until they don't.\n\nIn general, be mindful of your surroundings. A populated campground with 12 people you will be unlikely to encounter animals vs when you are 20 miles down a dirt road, 5 miles deep in a trail you are now the intruder in the wildlife's territory. People will always help people when they can especially in the wilderness. Nature is a Greedy Bitch and will take everything and give nothing.",

Pepper spray is nice because it requires very little practice, doesn't require precise aim and has an \"area off effect\". You press and hold the button, and just spray in the direction of their face. Plus you aren't likely to kill someone with pepper spray. If you do choose to carry a handgun, please train with it. They aren't \"point and shoot\", as silly as that sounds. Be able to hit a target with a handgun isn't something that comes naturally to 99% of people. And you add on to that the fear, stress and chaos that is associated with self defence shootings and your odds of hitting the target drops even more. \n\nI'd say trail choice is big. Choosing a hike that is sufficiently popular, but not so easy to access that \"unsavoury\" folks might also be there. Read online, and find trails that are popular for families. Another thing is not being distracted. If you're the type to hike with headphones in listening to your favourite music, stop it. Your ears and eyes are the first line of defence, and that goes for walking about the town/city as well. If you have cell service and you notice someone on the path behind you or coming towards you, and you have a bad feeling, pull out your phone and call a friend/relative. Even better, FaceTime or video call. \"Hey [Name], I'm about halfway up [Trail name] and it's absolutely gorgeous. Look at the view!\" You can even take the opportunity to turn the camera around, maybe catch the person giving you a bad feeling. If you're outside of cell range, you need to do two things. First, make sure someone knows where you are and when to expect you back. Then if they don't hear from you within the allotted time, they can call 911 or S&amp;R. Secondly, get a satellite phone/messenger or personal location beacon. \n\nAnd just the obligatory mention, if you're hiking alone and outside of usual daytime hours, on top of the items above you really need to carry clothes for inclement weather as well as gear in case you end up stranded. It is more common than you think that someone goes out for a simple and easy day hike, then slips down a slope or breaks an ankle or gets lost or gets caught in storm, and they die. It happens to experienced hikers too. So having an emergency contact, a way of communication, signalling, as well as gear to survive a cold night in bad weather, is really important.",

Especially because you are a woman, having a firearm on you and easily accessible will negate the strength advantage of any waste of life that means to harm you. Aside from the firearm, bringing one or two large dogs with you is also a great deterrent. Of course, if you don\u2019t own a dog, this will not be an option for you.",

As far as safety goes, take the precautions ANY person, male, female or anything else, should take.    Let your family /housemates know where you are going and roughly when you plan to be back.  Have an explicit plan about who should do what if you don't make contact within X timeframe.     \n\n\nI carry a pocketknife, but as part of an emergency kit with water, first aid, dry socks and a flint, not a stab teh menz kit.        \n\n\nI DO wear an emergency whistle.  Again, i think this is something everyone should do and has very little to do with meeting uncomely persons.     \n\n\nI have met old men, young men, groups of men on the trail, and have never been threatened or left scared in any way.  Trail hikers generally are very kind, friendly, decent people.       \n\n\nYou're far more likely to encounter the dangerous type in a bar.  Or a church.     \n\n\nDo the same thing you'd do anywhere .  Be alert and aware.  We have it drilled into our heads from when we're little girls to be aware and alert.  You don't cross a dark parking lot at night with your head down listening to music and looking at your phone.  Same thing on the trail.  Head up, make eye contact, be aware of your surrounding.",

First off, there's the old correlation/causation argument - it could be, after all, that people who are in situations where they're likely to be shot (i.e., people involved with gangs/the drug trade, or people who live in inner cities) are more likely to want to carry a firearm in the first place.  \n\nBut even beyond that, this study you've linked is a PARTICULARLY terrible one.  In particular, they have a very poor control group defined.  \n\n&gt;As such, we reasonably chose not to exclude participants as immune from hypothetically becoming cases because they were, for instance, asleep at home during the night or at work in an office building during the day. Instead we measured and controlled for time-based situational characteristics that might have changed, but did not eliminate, the possibility of being shot in an assault.\n\n...\n\n&gt;We pair-matched case participants to control participants on the date and time (within 30-minute intervals; i.e., 10:30 pm, 11:00 pm) of each shooting. This was done because the factors we planned to analyze, including gun possession, were often short-lived making the time of the shooting most etiologically relevant.\n\nIn other words, this study looks at people who were victims of an assault, and compares them against a random resident of Philadelphia at the same hour - EVEN IF THE RANDOM PHILLY RESIDENT IS, SAY, AT WORK, OR IN BED, ASLEEP.",

You're correct that 99.9% (made up on the spot, admittedly) of people don't need a gun to be safe going on simple hikes, or at the grocery store, or anywhere, but the remaining .1% are either thankful that they had one or wish that they did. I don't know many people that lived through a violent assault or rape and were thankful that they weren't armed.\n\nMuch like a seat belt or fire extinguisher, you rarely need one, but it is a good idea to cover your bases. A firearm is the one tool that will put the smallest woman on a level playing field with the largest man, and understanding this doesn't make one a nutjob. If you don't like them that is fine, but to insinuate that they are useless is just willful ignorance.",

The risk of being attacked by a cougar in the US is roughly one on a billion (that is the actual statistic, not an exaggeration). The risk of being killed by your own gun\u2026is much higher. The risk trade-off there makes absolutely no sense, and yet I still see it here on at least a monthly basis when people ask about cougars. Very poor survival math, which makes me immediately assume the person giving advice has no idea what they\u2019re talking about and just has uncontrolled paranoia about wildlife. \n\nBears can be a different story, admittedly, depending on where you\u2019re at. But it\u2019s still important to be doing that calculation and not just compulsively responding \u201cGLOCK GLOCK GLOCK\u201d to every twinge of fear. After all, learning to reasonably push your comfort zone and make good calculations about risk is part of what hiking is about.",

You should probably lighten up and not live in mental and emotional fear of every man you do and don't encounter, it's probably negatively impacting everyone around you.  I'm a giant, I get sick of all the scared looks and gasps, speaks more to the scared idiot than it does to me, I'm just walking around minding my own business, going to work, buying stuff at the store, being in nature.  However, I know wild stuff happens, and being ready to act in an instant has kept me alive several times in my life.  Your first defense is running like your life depends on it, screaming all the way, fighting tooth and nail if you are caught.  Weapons require training, practice, don't carry if you're not practiced. However, I believe in being armed and self reliant, I'd recommend a sturdy walking stick that you can beat someone with, keep them away.  If you're into guns the S&amp;W Shield EZ is something I can definitely recommend for any shooter, inexperienced or very experienced, it just works well and easy. A behind the back inside the wasteband holster is easiest for hiking without a pack, or shoulder harness is great if you're able to cover it up.  I don't go out alone for safety reasons, I keep a small beofeng ham radio on my pack with the local EMS freqs loaded in case I get hurt or in a jam.  The UV-5R radio is like $30 on Amazon and the battery will last just about all day, googling the frequencies is free, you can get a basic ham license for very little time and money but if you're in an emergency they probably won't get upset for broadcasting on a ham freq without a license.  Loading Gaia GPS on your phone and getting the maps can get you a GPS grid location if you have to call for help on ham or cell phone.\n\nI hope this helps.",

            "comment": "I'm a woman and I hike and alone.  If you have to drive out of your way to get to a hiking destination, the people who show up there are there to hike.  Most crimes are crimes of opportunity.  You're far more likely to be robbed or harassed in a populated area.  For safety, I have water, lighter, headlamp, and an extra layer of clothing.\n\nI used to ride my bike on an isolated feeling trail that went through a populated city area.  Not everyone I would see on that trail was out for exercise, dog walking, etc.  I bought pepper spray that I attached to my handlebars.  I never once had an unpleasant encounter on that trail, but it made me feel better.\n\n\nIf having pepper spray makes you feel safer, carry it, but know that you're safer out hiking than  doing most things like shopping, going to shows, filling up your gas tank, going to church, etc.",

            "comment": "The sort of people who go hiking are in general quite friendly and are far less dangerous than pretty much any other demographic can think of. Including the men.\n\nAnd most trails have lots of people, so unless you're hiking in the middle of the night, chances are you'll encounter a lot more people than you exp6, even if you're hiking alone.\n\nThat said, there are always exceptions.. In most of the country, it's pretty easy to get a concealed carry permit, and learning how to shoot and carrying a gun can be a very empowering experience.   \nIf you're in a big city or some other place where the US constitution effectively does not apply, or if you're hiking in a national park or some other area where guns aren't allowed, then pepper spray or bear spray plus a knife is good to carry.\n\nYou might also consider learning and practicing Brazilian jujutsu, if you have the time and resources for that. It is one of the few legitimate martial arts that is particularly effective when used against much larger and stronger opponents, do it's ideal for self-defense.",

            "comment": "Definitely take some mace with you as a precaution. A whistle is lightweight and you never know if you might need it. A GPS beacon is pretty expensive but you would be able to send an emergency SOS with some of them. Go to your local REI or outdoor goods store and ask about it. \n\nBe careful about taking a gun. I don\u2019t know where you are but in the US firearms are now illegal in certain national parks (or all, I\u2019m very unclear on this legislation). But hey, if you get trained in use and learn applicable laws all the better to protect yourself with. \n\nThis being said, you will 99% be fine just hiking on established trails. Most creepers aren\u2019t prowling around the woods, they\u2019re probably hanging around by your local sports bar or something. If you\u2019re so petrified of all men that you can\u2019t take the off chance of running into a group of them anywhere maybe you should address that with therapy. I\u2019m not trying to minimize your fears, as far as I can tell they\u2019re perfectly valid, I\u2019m just saying men exist and like nature the way that you do so you will be seeing them on the trail. Whatever you do, I hope you find a way to feel comfortable and get outside! It belongs to all of us and is just as beautiful and incredible as you want it to be :)",

Full of vitamins and other good stuff. Often it is filled in bottles with lemon peels and cloves. Then it stored in cellar to let it ferment a bit. The taste changes quite a bit. It becomes this fizzy drink with distinct taste. Pretty hard to describe in more details.\n\nThe drill hole should be closed afterwards to not damage the tree.",

It was forbidden in our family to dispose of or break champagne bottles because gram would boil them to kill all bad bacteria, then fill them with fresh birch water, add a sprig of blackcurrant branch, a few raisins and some lemon or orange peel. Then tap it closed and store it in cold cellar for at least 3 months. You know its ready when the bottles start exploding in the cellar lol. It fizzes and pops more than the original champagne ever did, its so good and refreshing. The best way i could describe it to someone who has never tried it, is its like hard lemonade but with barely any alcohol in it. Regular lemonade doesnt match, but hard lemonade tastes suprisingly similar. Also similar in flavor to carbonized kamboocha. Sour, sweet notes, very fizzy and so refreshing. Best hot summer drink.",

This is on my own land tho!! \n\nIt's only possible in early Spring (Feb to Mar where I am). Rest of the year you're just leaving holes in the tree and you won't get any sap. I'm not certain if it's as temp sensitive as maple, because there is less sugar in the sap. But it does still need a rise and drop in temp for the sap to flow. \n\nThe taste of white birch sap isn't my fave. Kinda like essence of Ikea.",

Whether it is a norm or not it is a thing and you\u2019d be surprised how common it is (speaking from a nurse perspective). I do not get the point of your comment. The point of this forum is to educate people so they can survive in the wilderness. No one is saying what people should or should not consume based of off allergies. Just like I did not know birch juice was a common drink and you did not know birch allergies are common the point here is to educate.

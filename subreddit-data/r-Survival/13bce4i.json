            "comment": "We go on really long rides, deep into wilderness, sometimes there isn\u2019t a signal for miles.  Things can happen on the trail, so we always try to be prepared. \nWe pack a small bin that is attached to the back rack. In it we pack a small tarp, rope, extra lights, batteries, a lighter.  We keep a few bottles of water, small first aid kit, a multi knife, couple of candy bars, and a few tools. I have a small solar phone charger, which is good to have in case as well. I always bring a pack jacket too and gloves.  We bungie an air pump on to the rack. On longer drives, we bring extra gas. \nHope this helps.",

It's nice to have but a bandaid isn't going to do anything for a small cut that licking it and applying pressure with a handkerchief can't do.\n\nYou're not going to stop someone bleeding out from a compound fracture, major puncture wound like a sharp branch at speed or a gunshot with a couple of squares of gauze, some tape and some bandaids and a few ibuprofen.\n\nIf you're going deep in the woods (especially on an ATV, bicycle or ebike or any powered vehicle capable of more than walking speed) you really want a proper trauma kit with one or more real tourniquets, sterile packing gauze in quantity and maybe even some quickclot.\n\nWhich, honestly, quick clot should be avoided and saved for last because it's hell to clean out of wounds in the ER or ICU.\n\nGoogle \"Stop The Bleed\" for online overview training and local classes, and check out /r/tacticalmedicine. Google IFAK or Individual First Aid Kit while you're at it.\n\nNo, you can't really just use your belt or rope or something as a tourniquet. Those things fuck people up and don't stop arterial bleeding. Get a real, rated tourniquet with a windlass, windlass and a time/date label and get trained on how/when to use it.",

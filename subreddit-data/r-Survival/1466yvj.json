    "postText": "I have an ACR Electronics AquaLink personal locator beacon that has an expired battery which needs to be replaced.  I can\u2019t find a place near me that does that.  I called the company and their customer service didn\u2019t seem to have a clue. Does anyone know of a mail in service or a place near Portland, OR?  I see you can order batteries online but am not sure if replacing the battery is straight forward or something I shouldn\u2019t attempt on my own.  Any ideas? Thanks.",

Personally, I would not change it myself even if able to obtain the battery\u2026 it\u2019s not the time to cheap out when literally the only purpose of the PLB is to save my life. YMMV",

    "postText": "Doing a 14 day solo trip into Arizona's Rim country next month.\n\nFor those who know Arizona -- I'm dropping into Chevelon Canyon at Telephone Ridge, wandering north to Chevelon lake, then turning around and meandering my way south to the Rim Top trailhead @ the 260 and the Rim Road.\n\nIf I can't catch trout, I'll supplement my meals with crawdads.\n\nFor those who *don't* know Arizona, this particular creek has a somewhat legendary population of crawdads. The numbers are unreal.\n\nAny suggestions for meals, and has anyone ever cooked them in the coals of a fire rather than boiing them? How do crawdads turn out when baked in a fire? (I'd kill them first before throwing them in the coals. I'm trying to avoid carrying a pot with me, because weight, just want to take a small titanium cup.)\n\nLooking for meal ideas beyond just \"boil them in &lt;insert cajun seasoning&gt;.\" Nothing against cajun style shrimp, but I just can't do that every day I don't catch fish.\n\nSo far I have:\n\n* Crawdad tails in Shin Ramun ramen noodles + shelf stable bacon and scrambled egg mix and  (if I can find any this early in the year) purslane.\n* Crawdad tacos -- soft tacos, string cheese, hot sauce, and a side of instant beans\n* Crawdad omelets -- cheese, crawdad tails, scrambled egg mix.\n* Crawdads alfredo -- instant alfredo mix, crawdad tails, noodles\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\nNote: I'm allergic to nuts.\n\n(And, before anyone comments on low calories in crawdads/what if I don't catch any/etc - I'll have about 2000-ish calories a day, but this is to supplement what I'm carrying with me. And, I know this area really well -- did an eight day solo trip in the same area last summer, but did not cook crawdads because it rained very hard every day, and I didn't have a pot with me to cook them over my stove. This trip will be before the monsoon so hopefully fewer epic thunderstorms and more opportunity for campfires.) ",

            "comment": "To be clear, this post is about recreational camping not wilderness survival. \n\n----\n\nIf you're not gonna boil them (which I also recommend, just bring a pot it's so easy) then skewer them and roast them. You put a couple skewers through a group sideways to keep them from flopping about too much. Bring an onion with, skewer it too. \n\nIf eating the crawfish is supposed to be part of the point of the trip then it's worth carrying the right tools to cook them. Bring garlic powder, paprika, salt, pepper, oil, soy sauce.\n\nTo whit, I suggest you could carry a small cast iron pan. A little 6\"-er only weighs like a pound. and again, if the point of the trip is to enjoy the crawfish then don't half ass it. Boil the shells in your camp pot to make a crawfish stock and cook the tail meat in the small pan. Serve with rice cooked with the stock.",

The walls will be high enough to boil stuff and the bottom wide/flat enough to cook stuff normally. Itll save weight over the cast iron and will be more resilient(less chance of rusting while out). They only thing you lose out on is thermal mass so it wont be as good at searing stuff like meat, but it wont be bad either. I think the tradeoff is worth it.",

NWFS and Outdoor chef life have some great remote backpacking crawdad recipes on their youtube channels if you need some inspiration. But they pretty much always do a boil iirc. I have a simple mess kit that doubles as cookware and has a pot, it's barely an entire pound and I tie it off my pack frame to save internal storage. Since food acquisition isn't a necessity for you, bring the cookware as you can afford the calories lost carrying a small pot. You can also boil water for drinking if needed, which isn't a bad contingency plan in the desert. \n\nSome Mrs dash would be good since it's got dehydrated lemon, and isn't a Cajun seasoning but pairs well with seafood.

The fish are also very skittish and easily spooked; they're almost all wild, and there's a really healthy predator population, so only the smart ones survive.\n\nMostly brown trout, some brook trout and rainbows. Below Chevelon Lake (especially around Durfee crossing) there's the occasional smallmouth bass too.\n\nFair warning is that Chevelon has NO easy mode. Some of the roads are difficult. Telephone Ridge, Fisherman's Point are both a bit gnarly when wet. Not necessarily 4X4 roads if you've got a truck with good clearance , good tires, and know what you're doing, but not roads you want to take a passenger car down.\n\nTrails to the water range from \"annoyingly long\" to seriously sketchy, or sometimes downright dangerous.\n\nOnce you get down into the canyon, there's not really any trails, just game trails and bushwacky stretches of creek bed full of really dense stands of willow and brambles.  If you're good at off-trail navigation and reading the terrain it's not terrible, but I hear all the time from people who don't seem to be able to intuit their way to easier going and they get cliffed out or bushwacking through endless willows.\n\nVery few people go very far into the back country. I went seven days last summer without seeing another soul. Most seem to run into the willows and turn around and go back to their car.\n\nI've been going to Chevelon since I was a kid in the 80, probably thirty or forty trips in my life, sometimes a week at a time. I've learned to respect it and never underestimate it.   Fabulous place, but just ... never an easy mode.\n\nWatch the ravens if you're backpacking. They know backpackers hang food from trees. I'm taking a ratsack this trip, hoping to keep them out of my grub. Not hanging your food means the rodents and ants will get into it. (The bears, at least, seem pretty wild and afraid of people, and I've never had an issue. See a few.)",

            "comment": "As a native of New Orleans where crawfish is a staple in so many meals this post kind of confuses me. Simply put, crawfish can be substituted for any form of protein and can be cooked in just as many ways. Ideally boiling whole and live with any seasoning on hand, but grilled, saut\u00e9ed, roasted, baked, bbq\u2019ed, broiled, etc\u2026 just don\u2019t recommend them raw. If maximum nutrition is the goal then be sure to suck the heads and consume as much of the fat as possible and don\u2019t de-vain them. I don\u2019t know how the abundance or size of them in Arizona compares to that of Louisiana but a substantial meal by themselves would be roughly 3 to 5 pounds of whole live mudbugs.",

(This will require a pot with oil to fry them or you can \u201cbake\u201d them.\n\nCrawfish spring rolls or egg rolls super easy just have to have fresh local foraged veggies and bring rice paper  \n\nCajun Crawfish pasta bread bowl bring some yeast and flour, and cheese and a little pasta. You can bake the bread somehow then make your pasta in a separate vessel. Then just combine. Should be filling. Lot of carbs but damn good bring wheat flower. \n\nCrawfish jambalaya (easy one pot thing) add some tomato paste or sauce makes it way better. \nAlways brown the crawfish first no matter what, and saut\u00e9 them with onions. \nJust cook it well to kill the tomato acidity, then add rice cover and cook until rice is good. \nThis will also require boiling **but not like a \u201ccrawfish boil\u201d style**\n\n\nAlso, bring a a couple lbs. of hemp seeds they have a lot of nutrients and protein or hemp seed butter(like peanut butter). Idk what your requirements are for yourself in regards to what you can bring. \n\nAre you trying to stay as minimal as possible?\n\n\n**Edit: I see you\u2019re taking a small titanium cup, how big is it volume wise?**",

It's big enough to boil water for a mountain house meal or ramen, or to drink my coffee out of, but it doesn't work well for crawdads. It's just too small to do more than a handful at a time.\n\nI have a bigger pot that I can take, but I'm trying to be minimal as possible for weight &amp; space reasons. Two weeks solo/no resupply is a LOT of weight and bulk in consumables, no matter how minimal you go. \n\nPlus, freezing weather is really likely. That also means heavier gear.\n\nAnyway, bottom line is I'm giving lots of consideration to weight.",

Just gonna have to be one serving with the 650ml",

Maybe forage for wild spices to experiment with? I personally wouldn't eat instant anything without a well equipped commode nearby, so I don't do that outdoors.\n\nEveryone else is right btw... A pot is just too easy to carry, and it can make beer steamed crawdads. Camping and survival training doesn't have to be uncivilized, you know.",

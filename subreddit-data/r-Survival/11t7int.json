It definitely is not an ideal camping situation but we're always talking about wilderness survival, and this is 100% wilderness survival skill that can save your life.  \n\nPeople become so dependent on tents that they don't take the time to learn how to build a shelter. But this is also why you shouldn't go outside without at least in mylar emergency tube tent or blanket.\n\nThere's a company that sells on Amazon that does mylar lined ponchos and mylar sleeping bags. And they come in big sizes!  The only bummer is you have to buy five at a time, but it's like $20, so it's very reasonably priced, and it gives you enough that you can stash it in several places without having to make sure you always have it on hand.",

My personal interest is that of the outdoor recreationist who might get stuck/lost or injured and this setup is very well suited to that situation.\n\nI think it's the SOL bivy and blanket that they sell on Amazon. The blanket is pretty good, definitely better than the old crinkly foil blankets. I've seen a number of people use the bivy and they haven't been very enthusiastic. If you had nothing it would be some shelter but if you've got a fire people found it actually blocked the heat and got pretty wet inside. You could probably just cut it open and turn it into a blanket in that situation.",

Because that teaches for you what you need to know about living without power and living in the elements.\n\nA family camper can find themselves in a woodland survival situation very easily just by going for a day hike and losing the trail.  And those basic skills are the best things to learn, because from there you just expand your knowledge.  There's no more set up for failure than the camper who goes on a hike carrying only a water bottle thinking that nothing bad can happen because they're in a state or national park \n\nThat's why our GS troop goes over these skills every year.  It's extra important for our girls because we have a multilevel troop and we have girls rotating in and out every year.    Regardless of whether we're going to camp or we're on a day trip to a museum, we require that they carry a string backpack.  They each make and carry a basic first aid kit, compass, whistle, snacks, a bandana, flashlight or headlamp, a small tinder box, etc.  They learn how to use their whistle to call for help and to listen for a response.  It's only a little bit to carry, but it's a good habit to have on you for EDC.",

Down sleeping bags \"block heat\" as well. I think our ape brains tend to think \"blankie give heat\" when it's really \"blankie stop heat go away\" and also \"blankie stop heat/cold come in\".\n\nThey're gonna get wet, as well, via transpiration, it's true. Truly best used for a boost in a sketchy situation vs. as a bag alternative.\n\n&gt; You could probably just cut it open and turn it into a blanket in that situation.\n\nGood idea.",

I can say that for certain. When I was in cadets the warmest night I had was when me and my best friend who built shelters and camped in the woods for fun got placed together and we already had a home system for building shelters so we used that. When the competition came around we won first prize. Nice thick fluffy bows low roof was definitely an advanced shelter compared to the rest who used ground sheets and rope we had fun an if I could do that again I\u2019d do it. Best memory from my childhood. He definitely covered the basics but there\u2019s always room for improvement.

He also manages his time well, we don\u2019t see any stomping around in the dark and he even measures out his time to last light with his fingers, loved that. He also achieved a simple mantle with his design and it\u2019s a smaller space, so easier to heat and still achieves an exchange of air \u2026 but \u2026 yes here comes the butt\u2026 he doesn\u2019t lay down a thick pile of green soft evergreen needles as his bed, doesn\u2019t use the snow as insulation on top of his properly aimed woven evergreen bough roof by using simple shovel from the wood bark or shingle made with the axe. And he doesn\u2019t demonstrate overnight, still, significantly better than I saw in the original video I was trying to be constructively critical of.\n\nHere\u2019s a couple winter self feeding fire videos, hopefully we understand that the rootball could service as a effective means of self feeding as well with a few leaners, even skip cutting some of the smaller firewood and let the fire do the cutting:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DUakK3voWrA\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9-fvk2bZQg4\n\nHope that helps and if this also shows we don\u2019t have a video showing us all these concepts all in one, maybe this will help inspire someone to make one. I know it won\u2019t be me, for all my experience I\u2019m terrible with tech and it would probably look like a blooper reel :P",

Think of it like the shelter's mini-cellar / basement / crawl space.\n\nYou would be surprised that the difference even a few inches can make in these situations and its handy knowledge against wind and rain too ... as well as the circulation of air so that ending up in a bad air C02 and moist air mold spore situation is avoided too.",

In a sense, he slept under his firewood pile.  \n\nBut the theme was that everything he built lasted just as long as he needed it to, and then it was gone. I love the idea that he just had so much experience, he knew exactly how much material he would need for any given shelter and fire, and would double purpose them. That dude really nailed calorie management.  \n\nI think about that with shelter. How much effort is this to build, vs how many nights I\u2019ll be using it. Nowhere to the level Mors had it managed, in fact just begin to think about it.  \n\nHow much work is a raised bed, when you can string up a hammock? Or if it\u2019s just a few logs stacked cabin style, maybe that raised bed is your morning fire wood.",

We are all people building these immaculate shelters while in a \u201csurvival situation\u201d but never consider how much energy that takes, not to mention just staying warm for a night. \n\nI want to see more shelters made out of leaves or moss or something more realistic when it\u2019s cold, raining and heat is the cutest from your mind",

We did nothing outside, just had stupid meetings in a church with stupid ceremonies. And we had to sell stupid popcorn. All of the badges I got were for shit we did in a church basement, arts and crafts bullshit. It was so dumb and I quit after about a year.\n\nThen I found my dad's old scout manual, one of the 1959 editions, and it was awesome. I asked if he did all that shit and he did. He said scouts must have changed since he was in it. I don't remember which book edition I had, but it was mostly about how to earn badges and how the stupid ceremonies work.\n\nI've talked to other people who had amazing experiences in the scouts but I guess it depends where you were and which troop/pack/whatever you were in. Mine was garbage and was one of the biggest wastes of time I had as a kid.",

Not that memorizing isnt good. Or that a brain injury couldnt render both memory and the ability to read null. But, it's just something to consider.\n\nWhile I dont keep such survival cards on my person at this time, I do keep a laminated card in my wallet with my name, address, medications, medical conditions, doctor, emergency contact, and contact for who my cat is staying with. If Im hiking with someone else, I include some info about them as well. A copy of this info, along with a description of myself, my clothing, my gear list, and itinerary goes to the friend who calls search and rescue if I dont meet a check-in deadline.",

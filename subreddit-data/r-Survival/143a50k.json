Or a base station and hand helds.  You can get something like the Motorola t470 or t800 which claims a 35 mile range on a perfect day if you\u2019ve got flat terrain and no issues at all. (Which you\u2019ll never see or get in my experience) \n\nBeyond that you have to consider commercial transmitters or repeaters.   Line of sight is always your enemy with radio.   You need elevation or extra transmitters to for any legitimate range.",

So, if you include such tech in 'everything', then you will have to go to radio. \n\nHam radio does not rely on any 3rd or intermediate party or infrastructure; you can have a completely independent station.  So long as your radio is not damaged and you can charge your batteries, you can communicate. \n\nHandhelds using 2m or 70cm signals are only good for you and your buddies within a few kilometres.  Repeaters can extend this; but, they will be part of 'everything' that has gone to shit.  Claims pasted on little radios with tiny antennas for ranges boasting 25 - 35km are complete bunk; though not impossible, there is no way to reliably communicate that distance with such radios, moreso when you are out in the middle of nowhere.\n\nA small HF radio is the key: an FT-817 or something similar, a FT-857D e.g., will get you local, regional and intercontinental communication that is still small and light enough to be carried in a backpack with other gear. My friend has one of these: [(tr)uSDX](https://dl2man.de/).  Small enough to fit in your pocket and can be powered directly from a solar panel.  Not the easiest radio to use, but, still works well enough when paired with a good antenna. \n\nI myself use an ft-817 with a small, external amp, adding 50 watts; 9 AH of battery and a solar panel. For 20m signals - long distance signals, for 40m signals - regional distance signals, and for 80m signals, short distance signals - I have a simple 20/40/80m NVIS dipole made of 26 gauge wire. With this antenna and radio, I can talk to my friend in my town, all over my province, pretty much every US state, Europe, South America, Africa - its even sent signals to stations in Antarctica.  I can attach a rasberri pi to the radio too and send emails and digital text messages directly to other radios; and, if not everything has collapsed, but only in my area; and, if those other stations still have access to the internet, they can post and relay my email and text messages over the internet to other people.  This system I have set up for use on my back-country canoeing or camping trips and in case aliens invade or zombies come around.\n\n\n[This is a typical example of my use of my radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJj0iwi1RlQ).",

So, even if the hardware was working and not destroyed as you pointed out, there are access issues at a user or subscriber level that could make them inaccessible during an emergency.\n\nThere are Ham radio satellites that are in orbit for public use; but, they are not all that efficient or easy to make work for regular communication.  I have tried myself; and, it is far harder than the regular ham bands using signals bounced off the ionosphere.  \n\nMoreover, satellite services are limited in supply; and, I suspect they would get overwhelmed, much as terrestrial cellular networks do, if demand during a crisis went critical.",

Unfortunately, radio is the one thing you can't just \"buy and figure out how to use when you need it\"; it's an art that you need to be well versed in beforehand. Don't believe the bullshit you see on shows like the walking dead - a handheld will only get you a few km of range at most, and that will depend largely on what is between you and the receiving party. If you are blocked by a shit tonne of trees, then it will decrease your range drastically (rule of thumb is line of sight for VHF and UHF handhelds). You can improve the distance by crimping a hoop ring to a bit of wire (length depends on the frequency you are using) and putting on the screw part where your antenna goes in (effectively turning it into a dipole, which are more efficient than the aesthetic random wire length it comes with), but this will only get you another few km distance tops. What you want to look at is a HF radio, as these signals can be bounced off the ionosphere to other countries for long distance communication (the frequencies for VHF and UHF are too small and just go straight through it). The problem with HF is that the frequencies associated with it are lower, which means much longer wavelengths, which means much longer antennas, not something that can be packed as conveniently as in as in a handheld - you can get away with hanging some wire in a tree, but you need to know what you are doing. I'd recommend a buddipole antenna and a yaesu ft857d if you can find one; this is the most portable and easy to use set up I've come across for effective long distance comms, but don't kid yourself if you are thinking you'll fit it in a back pack; more a stash in the back of the car type thing (Tasmania tiger do make an excellent radio backpack if you atleast want to bag the radio to protect it). But even then, you are going to need to know what HF band you are going to use (there are pros and cons for each depending on the time of day and year and atmospheric conditions), how far you are likely going to be from your partner (you need to know if they will be in the skip zone or if  you can use an NVIS set up etc)and how to set up your antenna for the most efficient way to communicate (this is incredibly important, 99 percent of using a radio is understanding the antenna and setting it up properly). The good thing about the buddipole is that it will give a good range of different use scenarios, and will let you use a variety of different propagation angles for NVIS, DX (long distance) etc",

For example if you're both at work you agree to meet at your home unless that's unreachable, in which case you meet at a prominent land mark like the top of a hill. You can come up with as many scenarios as you like and plans about how long you wait etc. The key is having a plan. You could include attempted phone, radio etc. contact in that plan, but I think having at least one place to aim to meet at in the event of no contact being possible makes a lot of sense.",

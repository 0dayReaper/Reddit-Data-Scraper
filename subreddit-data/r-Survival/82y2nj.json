He has possible fractures to his extremities, ribs, spine and head with possible internal organ bleeding. Protocol calls for rapid trauma evaluation, immobilization and extraction. Instead, we're just gonna grab him by a limbs, roll on top of him with our entire body weight, grab another limb and throw him over our shoulders like so much sack of potatoes, then proceed to justle him about for a good while until we've aggravated every single one of those injuries.\n\n",

    "postText": "I've been watching the show Alone, and over a few seasons it's scary how common/frequent it is for someone to catch a fish, kill a squirrel etc and end up getting ill from it. One guy was sick for a couple days after eating raw fish eggs, but ended up recovering. Another guy ate a squirrel and it destroyed his stomach, he tapped out due to not being able to keep water down for days.\n\nObviously you want to thoroughly cook whatever you catch, but in the squirrel case that wasn't enough to \"purify\" the meat for safe consumption. Do you have to basically just roll the dice every time you cook something and hope it will be safe? How do you ensure what you're eating will be safe? I'd be so paranoid of everything I ate being tainted, that I'd be afraid to eat anything I caught in the wild.",

In a survival situation, you probably won't have a working fridge.  Say you are one person by yourself, and  you have a whole chicken that you are boiling for a meal.  You can let it cool down, and just put a boil on it every 6-8 hours, to kill off any bacteria forming.  Or keep it on a low heat, continuously. But that is what we do with the chicken leg quarters for the dogs, and it never goes bad.",

The people with strong immune systems who didn't die simply lived with symptoms like mild diarrhea or nausea that are easy to ignore. My college roommate was like this second group. Never refrigerated leftovers, never used a thermometer while cooking, very lax on cross contamination from raw meat, yet claimed to \"have an iron stomach\" and \"never get sick.\" Except we shared a bathroom so I know they had diarrhea very often.

Beyond that there is sanitary processing. When butchering you can introduce nasty stuff to the meat if you puncture organs or the digestive tract. Finally, you look at the organs themselves as well as the meat. Check the liver for spots, muscle tissue for cysts, see if any organs show signs of disease or parasites. Finally, cook hygienically and thoroughly. Those are really the main precautions. \n\nIt\u2019s always a roll of the dice to a degree, and the primary risk factor is hygiene and sanitation which is obviously lacking in wilderness survival situations. It might not have even been the cooked squirrel that made him sick. If his hands weren\u2019t washed adequately after handling the animals, that could have done it.",

Generally if it\u2019s warm out, you want to get whatever you kill either chilled or grilled immediately.  \n\nPrimitive tribes in warm areas would make a kill and build a fire and start processing it on the spot. They ate the livers and other delicacies while they smoked the meat immediately and had a boy standing there with a leafy branch to shoo the flies off it as it cooked. For large animals, the whole tribe would take part in this work. \n\nKnowing what we know about germs, we can see the obvious benefits to this. We can also see the benefit to the domestication of livestock- your meat wasn\u2019t going bad if it was still on the hoof. You could walk it to your processing area and slaughter and butcher it in a nice cool stone shed with a thatched roof and a hoist, with a door to keep the flies out, grind up the less desirable bits with fat and maybe grains and blood to make tasty sausages to take to your smoke house. \n\nFor any wild game, you want to get it gutted as soon as possible. I push gut rabbits as soon as I pick them up before they go in my vest. Squirrels don\u2019t push gut like rabbits but a sharp knife makes quick work of it. \n\nPractice the old ways now while we have medical care to save you if you fuck up. Kill a rabbit or squirrel and build a fire and eat it on the spot. Don\u2019t neglect the liver, firstly it\u2019s a good indicator of an animal\u2019s health and safety to eat. If it\u2019s not spotty or parasitic it\u2019s a valuable little treat packed full of nutrients your body will need if the supply chain breaks down. They\u2019re at their best when they are lightly cooked while still warm from the animal.",

If meat-borne pathogens had been a significant issue, there would be no people today. So, how was this not a significant issue for our ancestors? By having a very low stomach pH that destroyed the microorganisms they digested, and by having healthy tight junctions in the gut lining, so that one's gut is not hyperpermeable for pathogenic organisms to escape intact through the stomach barrier into the bloodstream. Eating plenty of animal-based protein and fats on a consistent basis will help you have a very low stomach pH. Keeping your tight junctions healthy is largely a matter of avoiding eating things that damage your tight junction integrity, such as gliadin, lectins, oxalates, NSAIDs, too much grains, and too much sugar.",

Could have been anything bad water or something else they ate.\n\n2) For the *most* part, if it was healthy and alive, and they you cooked it fully, it should be fine to eat. This doesn't apply to fish/shellfish/crustaceans in contaminated water. There may also be local exceptions to this with specific animals that may be toxic. \n\n3) Food safety extends to how it's stored after you kill it. There's a science and an art to this, but *generally* speaking, meat needs to be kept below 40, above 140, or otherwise immediately preserved, to be safe. Preservation would be various combinations of freezing, smoking, drying, or salting. In a setting like 'Alone' it would be incredibly easy for somebody, for example. to catch a fish around noon, kill it, then not consume it until dinner, and now it's gone off and they're sick. Or they eat half a fish for dinner, save the rest for breakfast, and it's bad by morning. \n\n* I'd also be suspicious of any fish that died in a net. If the net's been out for a few hours, that fish may be bad now.",

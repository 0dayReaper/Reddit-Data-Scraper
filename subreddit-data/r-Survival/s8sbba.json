When it came time to demonstrate using pants as a flotation device, I swam back to the log and stood on it, making it much easier to concentrate on the task at hand.\n\nIt was 30 years ago, but nobody tell the BSA",

            "comment": "This is not the best idea.... Now hear me out, I'm not hating at all, I'm just saying aren't life jackets in the event of a emergency? Like how slim are the chances that those \"emergencies\" leave you unconscious? I'd like to think a lot possibly, especially with boating, and this just seems like a lot of steps, that have to be executed with attention, I just feel like many would be in shock during an emergency, or worst case unconscious. Plus this doesn't look friendly for elderly or children, so it's limited in it's survivability aspects in my eyes, but I'm not a scientist! Just my thoughts!",

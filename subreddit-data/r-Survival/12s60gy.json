It got me thinking about how difficult it would be to find water in such a situation.\n\nI know that finding water in the desert can be incredibly challenging. The dry, arid landscape and extreme temperatures make it an inhospitable environment for survival. However, I wanted to reach out to the community and see if anyone has any tips or recommendations for finding water in the desert if you were to get lost.\n\nI've heard of methods, like looking for vegetation that may indicate the presence of water underground and digging.\n\nBut I'm curious to hear from those who have successfully found water. What strategies did you use? How did you stay hydrated until help arrived?",

I started on the trail and hiked about a mile in, then went off the trail and started collecting fruit. One cactus led to another, and when I finished up and started walking back, I realized I couldn't retrace my steps to the trail. It was getting dark, so instead of risking getting even more lost by continuing to look for the trail, I decided to set up camp for the night. I had a poncho that I laid on the ground and started a fire with the esbit cubes I keep in my bag. I brought a little less then 1.5 gallons out with me because it was going to be hot (around 86\u00b0F) but I had already gone through all of this water by this point \n\nIn the morning, I walked a perimeter around the area where I first realized I was lost. I took 500 steps in as straight a line as possible in all directions from that point, marked the spot, and then moved past it if I didn't see anything. I did this 6 times, and finally found the trail about 1000 steps away from where I first realized I was lost.\n\nIn the future I'm going to bring little flags with me to mark my way and pay more attention to my compass when I'm walking, that way I actually know what direction I need to go to get back to the trail.",

Another thing I recommend is get a map of where you plan on going (even if it's just a screenshot from Google Maps), tell a friend where this is and when you expect to be back. You don't want to go off to the wilderness with no one back home having any idea where you are.",

In the Mojave Desert during the summer I have never a single time in 35 years ever ran across water at random.  Same with Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico.  The only water I have ever found were those spots marked on a map.  I have tried digging for water right after the rain as well just to see if I could get water.  I have never successfully been able to get anything other than mud.  When it comes to the desert, carry a map and compass, know how to use them, and carry as much water as you can handle.  \n\nWhen I was a teenager, I got lost with two friends in the Baja California Desert.  We were so dehydrated towards the evening that we couldn\u2019t even speak.  No more sweat and you could feel the air and dust entering and exiting your lungs.  Never again will I ever hike, camp, fish, or hunt without emergency gear and as much water as I can carry.  I kid you not, that experience had such a profound effect on me that you will never see me without a drink in hand or within arms length to this day.",

There was some water in it, but also dead animals we saw along the way.  So drinking that was out of the question for us no matter how bad the thirst got.  We would have eventually caved had we not eventually found a farm which turned out to be a vineyard.  We stuffed ourselves with mouthfuls of sour green grapes until we puked.  After that we made our way over to the house and explained to the woman who was home what was going on.  She handed us a big warm bottle of Coke and asked us to wait outside until her husband got home.  I can\u2019t say I blame her. Rural Mexico late at night and three strange dudes begging for help at your door step.  Not to mention no phones or much of anything.  Let me tell you, hot Coca Cola BURNS when you\u2019re dehydrated!  Once her husband got home and we explained ourselves he gave us a ride in his truck back to my buddies uncles place where all three of us were quickly read the riot act along with the swinging of a thick leather belt lol.

            "comment": "Totally depends. In many deserts, you can still dig a well and have a chance at finding water. For the best chances, look for creek beds. Even if the creek is \"dry\" it can still have water under the surface. Many deserts still have springs, creeks, rivers and streams it's just that they might be dry for parts of the year. But as I said, it doesn't mean there isn't water if you dig. Generally finding low points, ideally in shade and between two higher regions, will be your best chance. Presence of vegetation can be a good indicator as well. As far as surface water, your goal is to look for areas with certain geological features. Areas with more compacted earth or clay, or rocky features like outcrops, which can retain surface water especially in the shade. Drinking water can be extracted directly from some desert plants like certain cactus, or collected using \"condensation traps\" which create a greenhouse around vegetation. Finally, despite generally being seen as \"dry\" many deserts do still experience dew. Over night as the surfaces becomes cooler than the air, the moisture in the air condenses. A common way to collect morning dew, is to use a fabric like a t-shirt or scarf/shemagh. If you leave a large piece of fabric hanging overnight, then in the morning (if the conditions are right for dew) the fabric will be wet or even saturated with water. Similarly you can just run the fabric over the wet ground/vegetation, then wring out the water into a container or even directly in to your mouth. \n\nSo there are a lot of ways to potentially find water in a desert. As far as what your \"odds\" are, it depends on so many things. \"Desert\" isn't a singular concept, there many types of deserts. And besides that, recent climate and weather as well as what time of the year it is will all influence what your odds are of finding water.",

You can usually drink it directly too, without a filter or boiling which is nice.\n\nOf course you need to make sure you have a bag first.

            "comment": "First of all, a satellite distress beacon is in my opinion a necessary tool for survival in the desert.\n\nIf you can't afford those (a hundred bucks?), at least make sure you have your phone setup with an offline mapping/GPS app so you don't get lost, and a way to keep your phone charged, and (this is the most important part) tell someone where you are going ahead of time and *do not deviate from that path*.\n\nEven if it's a short journey, you might accidentally damage your water bottle. Or your vehicle could break down. You just can't ever guarantee you'll have enough water, and no water in the desert is a thousand times more dangerous than coming face to face with a fully grown and hungry polar bear armed with a sharp rock. You might be able to scare off the polar bear. You're completely defenceless against dehydration.\n\nHaving said that, yes, there are plants that only grow if there is water near the surface. If you are familiar with the local area, then you can learn how deep the roots go for each individual plant species and sometimes water might only be a couple minutes of digging under the sand. Knowledge like that is hyper localised though. You need to get it from someone who is intimately familiar with your location.\n\nI know a bit (not an expert) about the desert in central Australia, and as far as I know the availability of water often depends on how much rainfall they had months ago on the other side of the continent. Some plants go dormant and can survive years without water, but when they have water they look totally different. You can use things like that as a guide to find water.\n\nHave a look at this farmer's photo of their air strip for some idea how different things can be depending on rainfall in central Australia (note: this isn't desert, but desert plants have similar variations):\n\nhttps://cattleproducer.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/northern-wet-season/\n\nNote it's not just the grass - the trees change too. If you scroll down though, you'll see a photo of trees that are perfectly healthy in the dry season. Not all plants go dormant when it's dry. And a lot of plants adjust their behaviour based on how long the sun is up each day! They literally measure the seasons by sunlight and just assume the normal seasonal rainfall will be around once the length of each day reaches a certain amount. You need to know which local plants change based on water availability to find water.",

            "comment": "There are a couple of good Desert survival books out there. . I can recommend a few. \n\n***The Basic Essentials of Desert Survival*** by Dave Ganci\n\n\"*Exactly what the title says. Does a good job of debunking many myths about desert survival techniques. Anyone who is preparing for a possible desert survival situation would benefit from the information in this text. Solid, practical advice presented in a readable and sometimes humorous fashion. Oriented towards the U.S. Southwestern Deserts, but generally applicable to most desert environments. The awkward size doesn't lend itself as well to use as a field manual as I would prefer, but if size is not an issue, for a desert environment survival kit, it would advantageous to have along. Ganci operates* ***Arizona Outdoor Institute.***\"  \n\n\n***Desert Survival Handbook*** By Charles A. Lehman\n\n\"*Typical Lehman, good, sound, practical, basic advice on desert survival with a touch of humor and good illustrations. Oriented towards the U.S. Southwestern Deserts, but generally applicable to most desert environments. Could be used as a manual to include in a desert survival kit.*\"\n\n***Desert Survival Skills*** By David Alloway\n\n\"*While Alloway's focus is the Chihuhuan desert (think S.W. Texas) most of the excellent information is equally applicable to most any desert environment. The specifics of some plants may differ, but the techniques for survival remain the same. Alloway dispenses with many myths about the desert and desert survival and offers sound, useful advice and plenty of it. It's well written and instructions are easy to follow for the most part.*  \n*While the illustrations could be better in a few cases, this is the most complete available desert survival text and should be required reading for anyone who lives or travels in desert areas. Could be used as a manual to include it in a desert survival kit. Alloway operated David Alloway's* ***Skills of Survival school*** *before passing away suddenly in 2003.*\"\n\nand:\n\n***Desert Survival - Tips, Tricks. &amp; Skill******s*** By Tony Nester  \n\n\n\"*Nester's compact text on Desert Survival is focused on the deserts of the American Southwest, but the majority of information is just as appropriate for any desert environment. This is not an all-inclusive text, rather, as the title suggests, it is a collection of practical information you need to survive most desert survival circumstances. The \"tips, tricks and skills\" provided are easy to understand, effective and can be put to use by even the most inexperienced.*  \n*The photographic illustrations provided are effective and used to good effect; sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. Could be used as a manual to include in a desert survival kit. Nester operates the Ancient Pathways survival school and is also the author of \"Practical Survival - Tips, Tricks, &amp; Skills\" and \"Surviving A Disaster - Evacuation Strategies and Emergency Kits for Staying Alive*.\"\n\nThere is one other:\n\n***Desert Survival*** by Dick Nelson and Sharon Nelson \n\nThis one, while a decent book is not quite as useful as the other four listed above.  Dick Nelson's is a self published book, and one reviewer puts it this way:\n\n*\"A somewhat dated text, but still useful. Lots of good, sound, practical advice on desert survival. A bit dry at times, but tolerable. Not much in the way of illustrations. Oriented towards the U.S. Southwestern Deserts, but generally applicable to most desert environments. No index! Could be used as a manual to include in a desert survival kit.*\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll are pretty good references and give great insight that you do not find in general survival books.  All can be found on Amazon at reasonable prices.  I can recommend ever one of them.  \n\n\nReviews courtesy of ***Doug Ritters \"Equipped to Survive***: website, specifically from the page on publications.  Here:  http://www.equipped.com/books.htm",

Left me no alternative but to hike out, approximately 30 miles, to reach a traveled road.  \n\nI had good maps of the area, and the maps showed the location of springs in the desert mountains.   I had visited at least one of the springs on a prior exploration and knew it had good drinkable water with good flow.    Sometimes desert springs shown on some maps turn out to be dry.\n\nI made a plan to hike mostly at night to avoid dehydration, laying up during the day, a route the included the springs.   The plan worked well.  As I finally got nearer to a traveled road, a couple of helpful self described \u201cdesert rats\u201d, hard-core,  picked me up in their old Ford 4X4 pickup and gave assist.   They chewed me out royally for not carrying a firearm.    Actually, I was, but hadn\u2019t let them know, not sure initially if I could trust them.  \n\nOften the best policy is to stay at your vehicle, wait for help.   But nobody had any idea where I was, not smart on my part, and the desert track I was on looked like it hadn\u2019t been traveled in weeks.   So I made the decision to hike out.   I knew I could find reliable water at the spring I had visited previously, about mid-way to a traveled road, and only a mile or two off the most direct route.  \n\nThese days I carry a Garmin Inreach, with sat comm capabilities.    And I always carry backup power, a power bank of some sort, to recharge cell phone and Garmin.   I might consider substituting an iPhone 14 at some point, with emergency sat comm capability.   If I weren\u2019t carrying the Garmin, I\u2019d at least carry a locator beacon such as a Res-Q-Link, much cheaper and no subscription plan, but no two way comm capability.",

People do not thrive on cactus water (some types make dehydration worse) and they dont survive long off evaporated drips in a plastic bag. Additionally a lot of desert is hard rocky ground you can't dig into to look for ground or root water. It's simply not reasonable to think you could stay alive for the 72 hours+ on a source of h2o you didn't pack in.\n\nI hope you learned a valuable lesson for cheap here. You either plan to thrive in the desert or you plan to die in the desert.",

            "comment": "(Arizona, USA) Eagle Scout here. The odds of finding water in the desert are very small. Hard to quantify. It depends on how close to civilization you are. What i've noticed in this page, is that no one has told you about preventative survival measures, which, for r/survival - a survival page - is scary. Having a person with you is absolutely essential, even if it's on a silly-ass paved-path hike. I'd like to imagine you've heard of the 10 essentials, but your 11th essential is a reliable person who can help mitigate the dangers of a lethal situation, such as no water, a broken foot, or whatever the case may be. My rule of thumb is 1 gallon of water per person per day, then add 3 gallons for each person to keep in the car (for putting out campfires, a wash basin, or extra drinking water). Happy trails\n\nEdit for grammar, spelling, &amp; simple revisions",

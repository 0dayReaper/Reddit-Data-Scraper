I tend to favor stainless, as I'd rather have to worry less about corrosion and have to sharpen a little more often.  Stainless knives are usually easier to sharpen too, though at the expense of edge retention.  Your carbon steels will have better edge retention, but be more prone to corrosion and more time consuming to sharpen.\n\nA good comprimise could be a steel like D2 from Buck.  It has a high chromium content to the point it is almost a pseudo-stainless, but it is still considered a carbon steel and has better edge retention than most stainless.\n\nI'm very budget minded, and Buck and OKC are my go to for fixed blade knives.  I like Boker and Kershaw for my folders.  That being said, I'm not a heavy knife user so take that for what it is.",

What the steel is alloyed with makes a big difference too.  Also the heat treatment is going to matter a lot since that will result in a harder or softer knife even with the same type of steel.  Some \"carbon steels\" like 1084 will get to above 60 Rockwell (I think it can go as high as 64 as-hardened, about 61-62 with a normal tempering process).  Some will go a lot higher.  It just depends on a lot of factors.    \n\n\nOnly thing I really disagree with is that I think your overall rockwell numbers are all about 5 points low across the board.  50 rockwell would be a nice hammer, but probably a fairly shitty knife.  Realistically you're probably going to see most knives at around 60 rockwell minimum regardless of the type of steel they're made from, although again a lot depends on the heat treat you give them.",

My knowledge of steel mostly comes from the sword world, where higher hardness is dangerous so blade steels are kept fairly low.  Even something like 1095 can be problematic unless it's tempered.",

I'm admittedly more of a firearm guy and have jumped into the knife world relatively recently, so I got my lines crossed up.\n\nCarbons will be easier to sharpen and you'll get a sharper edge, but they are more likely to chip.  And of course more likely to corrode if not maintained properly\n\nStainless are harder to sharpen and don't get as good of an edge, but aren't as prone to chipping.  But are much less prone to corrosion so are friendlier to less maintenance.\n\nAll of that is speaking in generalities too.  As you get into the higher end steels, the differences become less pertinent/pronounced.",

Avoid the billions of Amazon and eBay specials lol. They're just junk knives using damascus as a selling point.\n\nIf you want better steel, there are modern knife steels (S35VN, Magnacut, S45VN, VG10, V3 etc) which will easily exceed what any first-time knife buyer wants to spend or requires in quality.",

Wootz is a high carbon steel that can hold and edge very well, though there are many modern steels that are much better.\n\nThe problem was that the kind of iron concretions necessary to make Wootz were very rare and limited. The process of making it being extremely limited and localized to a few master smiths and metallurgists.\n\nSo pattern welding more flexible and durable steel to Wootz allowed the makers to create blades that had the strength of the lower grade steel and the sharpness of Wootz while leaving an amazing and beautiful pattern. At the same time allowing them to stretch out the supply of the iron concretions.\n\nWhen it comes to modern steels pattern welding doesn't give any real benefit than making an awesome pattern. Modern chemistry enables us to create steels that are able to make much sharper and more durable blades than ancient Damascus.",

The process was secret, and the people who knew how died without passing it on.\n\nThey used unusual techniques like including leaves and wood as part of the alloy. Exactly how this was done is unknown and it's also not clear exactly what metals they used either.\n\nThere are stories of the blades being sharper than a razor blade and so strong you could cut steel with it. If those stories are true that would have been amazing for the time. Those stories are plausible but were probably bullshit.\n\nAs valuable as a real Damascus steel is now nobody is going to try cutting another sword with it. I wouldn't even sharpen a Damascus blade if I had one.\n\nIn any case, we know a *lot* more about metal now than we did a thousand years ago and we also have better tools.\n\nIf you're willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars forging a blade these days you can do all kinds of crazy stuff.\n\nEven just hundreds of dollars will get you something better than Damascus.

They won't talk about the incident as it seems to be a bit of a sore subject.  \n\nI do enjoy bringing it up in conversation though.",

I don't know how, or why, he does it.  I mean, I understand he wants to do a TV show and all that but to film yourself the way he does and then act like we don't all know you must come back and get your camera seems a bit silly to me.  \n\nI don't particularly think he's that great of a \"survivor\" either, considering how short of a time period he is out there, not to mention how many people would be looking for him if he didn't show up on time.  \n\nI know people are super opinionated about the survivor guys on TV so I am sure I have horribly offended someone, but that is not my intention.  I think Bear Grylls is a bit of a parody too, although both of them have interesting information to provide from time to time, in the episodes i have seen at least.   \n\nLike I never knew you could kill a snake and use its skin to store your piss so you can drink it again later.

This original failure initiates a rapidly cascading chain reaction of steam generation and explosive decompression^1.  You do not want to be anywhere near it when it occurs.  \n\nI imagine if you tried to burn the better part of a tree, considering the bigger the lumber the longer it takes to season and dry out, due to the (you guessed it) surface to mass ratio, the chances of it exploding go up.  \n\nIf you put a big tree into the fire with too much moisture/density or the right combination of the two, and that huge timber super-heated before it combusted, maybe because one end was in a fire and the other was not, and it popped, I imagine you *could* possibly start a forest fire and kill everyone in your camping party.  Worst case Ontario. \n\n#1: I am not sure this is technically \"explosive decompression\" as the pressure had not built up enough to be the force that causes the damage.  However, the pressure contributes to the water being heated to steam which does cause the explosion so one could make the case I guess that it is explosive decompression, of rapidly compressed-for-a-split-second burning wood.",

            "comment": "You should build a solid platform of an even mixture of kindling and fuel on the ground underneath your tinder. I usually place one layer of fuel and kindling, each piece the length from your palm to your elbow. Make it 1.5 feet square or so. Then another solid layer perpendicular on top of the first. Now place your tinder on top in the center of your platform. It won't take long and you'll have a nice flat layer of hot coals to cook on",

            "comment": "Having kindling as far as from your fingertips to elbow is not necessary at all. A good length is from your thumb to your pinky when you stretch them apart.\n\nFuel as long as your arm seems way too long, the longest you\u2019ll ever need  is from your finger tips to elbow, if even that long.\n\nEdit: I should note i usually do the criss cross fire. The teepee is ideal for warmt but burns fuel very quickly. The criss cross is good for cooking food/grilling sausages.",

I told them to find as many sticks as possible about the size (thickness) of their fingers.  They brought me lots of sticks and started breaking them into small pieces while I was doing something else.  Finally, I noticed and asked why they were breaking them into small pieces. \"So they'll be the size of our fingers.\"  I placed my palm gently against my forehead.",

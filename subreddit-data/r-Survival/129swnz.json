    "postText": "I wanna try making some primitive tools, but there is no flint where i live. Could quartz work as a substitute? It, like flint, is also very glass like, so it can be knapped to make a sharp edge. But i think it's more brittle than flint...\n\nShould i look for a specific type of quartz? Are there any other rocks that would be durable enough to make tools out of? What about granite?",

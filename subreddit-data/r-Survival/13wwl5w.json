            "comment": "Imo the Esee 6 is a little large and unwieldy unless 90% of the time you are batoning or splitting or other heavy duty use. Essee 4 is more rugged than the Mora but it is hard to beat the scandi grind for bushcrafting.\n\nThe mora has a bit of flex vs the essee could double up as a prybar. Not sure If I answered your question but do what you will with that info. If its any help I run a Fallkniven s1. Convex grind and built like a tank.\n\nGood luck",

            "comment": "Ok here's my opinion. mora knives along with all scandi ground knives excell at wood carving but . They will do other cutting tasks withing reason acceptable.  Now a saber ground or full flat ground will do better at slicing. convex ground blade will do better at chopping and batoning and do good at slicing and carving if they aren't overly thick. so out of your choices i would take the esee 6 because it will be a better choice for a wilderness or ubarn survival situation",

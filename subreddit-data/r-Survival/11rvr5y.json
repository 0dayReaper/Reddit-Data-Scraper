    "postText": "Last night I had a dream I was in some building and it was either being attacked or something. I was separated from my sons. I eventually found them. This got me thinking about emergency situations - I guess it comes down to being specific to a certain place you go - like meet at the north entrance\u2026 Is there a general meetup place any of you use with your families?",

My father and i have a standing arrangement to meet there if anything major was to happen. We dont even have to contact each other beforehand, its just agreed upon that we are to gather a few supplies and get there quick and figure out what to do from there.",

Everyone have a device that\u2019s on and charged?  Smartwatch, iPhone, etc?  Then we can easily find the kids and each other \n\n2.  If we are at a ball game I\u2019ll make them repeat the section and row of our tickets - several times.  If we are on the subway, repeat to me where we are getting off and which stop is \u201chome\u201d.",

I will say when I was a boy the rule was \"Go out the nearest exit, get to the back of the parking lot, find a Blue car, and wait by the hood.\" And the house plan was \"Get out, be sneaky, look for Dad. If you don't see him, run to the neighbors but don't cross the open fields.\"",

I'm estimating about 50-100 people total since it's more of a community we're trying to develop when shtf. There's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 locations I've found that work but each have their own parameters for survival.",

And also a backup plan incase that is not a possibility and she still wants me to find her in a shtf or other emergency (like summer fire season since the evacuation chances are extremely high)",

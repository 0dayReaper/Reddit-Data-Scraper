    "postText": "I'm currently writing a novel and in the current scene, the protagonist is forced to flee with one other person. They're forced to hide in the forest and it's winter, so there is moderate snow. They only have the clothes on their backs, a horse, and a blanket that functions as a cloak. The first is obviously to build a fire, but I'm not sure what else they can do to keep warm enough to survive the night. I've seen posts about building a shelter in a snow drift, but there isn't enough snow for that. They are low on equipment but the protagonist is very knowledgeable and skilled in quite a number of niche subjects.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your responses. And to the people who have expressed interest in my novel, I can\u2019t plug it because this sub doesn\u2019t allow self-promotion but I thank you for your interest! How I\u2019m going to write it is they make a lean-to with spruce boughs and logs to keep the wind out and swap out heated rocks throughout the night so as not to give themselves away with a fire.",

            "comment": "I live in the Dakotas. I'll tell you what a kid did in scouts here when I was younger. We had a space blanket, fire striker and a knife. Challenged to be able to keep warm to stay alive throughout the night.       \n   \nHe immediately gathered up a bunch of firewood and stones. Took him maybe an hour or two. He started a fire, got it good and hot then elongated it a little so it was probably 3 foot around. After he got it roaring he started digging a shallow hole with a stick. Not too deep but deep enough. He pulled all the soil to the side of this rectangular hole about 5.5 foot long by about 3 feet wide.   \n    \nHe went back and tended to the fire without a care in the world, gathering wood here and there. He had tossed the stones in the fire early on and just left em there in the edge of the fire. Got dark he stayed up. Everyone else was making some crazy shelter, or trying to. He didn't put a whole lot of effort into an overhead shelter. Just simply stick lean to.      \nThen he got all the giant chunks of charcoal from the fire, red hot, and the rocks. Put it all in the hole and spread it around evenly. He had more than enough. He then covered that with the soil and put the space blanket on that.      \nAnd that is how he slept through the night perfectly comfortable while everyone else was miserable. The coals stayed hot all night long with the rocks in there. They couldn't burn because of the top soil smothering them but they didn't go out completely. Still warm the next morning. He did keep a fire by his side throughout the night mind you but that was likely for fear of the dark and empty area.   \nThen he poured a bunch of water on the soil after removing his blanket and stirring it a bit. Put the coals out completely, of my knowledge. It's not like I checked back later thaat day.",

Statistically I think I'd die before I'd get to use knowledge like that anyway.      \n\nIf you want protection on the second, or higher floors of an apartment or house and the only way up is stairs, grab some plywood and nail it down the stairs at an incline. You should be able to get plywood from most houses and apartments(the floors should have only wood so tear up some carpet and try to use a crowbar. they should be big enough for any stair well). Then just cover it in used motor oil, which is frequently in garages or vehicles and easy to get out. Ole dead heads can't climb up the slick inclines. Don't forget to either remove handrails or board them straight up to the ceiling too. Very likely wouldn't work with a horse, but it would give you enough time to try to get out.    It's also nice to get out a piece of flooring plywood in an apartment so you can make a peep hole to check your lower surroundings.     \nMix close to equal parts of iron oxide dust and aluminum, there you go, you basically got thermite.

Not enough wood to make a proper shelter or burn much throughout the night so i dug basically a shallow grave for myself, burned some dead bushy stuff, grass and yucca fronds to where a had a layer of hot ash and coals lining the bottom of pit. Then as it got dark, i tamped out all the coals that were now obvious in the dimness. I buried it all under a couple inches of dirt and added some more brush on top to insulate me from the heat and threw my sleeping bag right on  the pit and tossed a tarp over the top. \n\nI wasnt worried about anything combusting because none of that stuff was getting oxygen. Wasnt worried about monoxide cuz i had my head peeking out the tarp. It got below freezing, i had the crappiest, cheapest sleeping bag on earth and i was toasty lol. Youd be surprised how long itll take even just the ground to cool.",

Like a 3' tall pile of pine boughs. Then he'd put another pile just as big on top of them. This works great as long as it's not raining. Even snow will stay frozen on top and not leak down getting you wet providing further insulation and wind protection.\n\nDry = life in this situation.",

Just me and -22 temps. https://youtu.be/wQ5MkcR0eVg\n\nWhat you can incorporate here:\n1) there are different types of snow, some may be too brittle or dry to pack a shelter. The vid shows how to get good packing snow. \n\n2) how to properly put down spruce boughs to lay upon\n\n3) make sure you use a specific fire type. Will your fire last all night or does your character have to keep feeding it the whole time? I use a V shaped auto fire here so I can sleep \n\nHope this helps!",

What sort of forest is it? Pine or fir? That'll make a difference on the desperation of the situation. If it's at or slightly above freezing, and you're in a fir/spruce/hemlock forest, then you build a shelter out of branches and fir bows. Build a sort of round, igloo shape out of bows, be sure to leave a small opening just wide enough to crawl through, stack the floor twice as thick as you think you might need, and stack on top/roof for as long as you have daylight. In that situation you sleep pretty comfortably.\n\nIf you're in colder temps and you don't have access to broad bladed conifers then probably you cut the horse open or you die.\n\nIf you don't have access to effective branches and you're spending the night in the open right at freezing then probably you cut the horse open or you die. Maybe. Depends on the quality of the other gear, are you out of the wind, etc.\n\nIf you're close to 0\u2070 or below it, you possibly die with a shelter, possibly just have a shitty night. But you're bone cold come morning and it never gets a whole lot warmer, so if you don't get up and get moving you die before the afternoon is done.\n\nWhether or not anyone is able to start a fire is going to depend on some factors but from your short description I don't think either of your characters is going to manage starting a fire with the materials available. Plus it sounds like they're running from someone? So that's probably not a good plan, barring total incompetence.\n\nIF they get a fire going then they huddle against a boulder and build a shelter around it with a fire at the base of the builder or slightly under, if possible. If it's not prohibitively snowy and they can gather a decent amount of firewood and they have an hour or so to build the shelter then it's a pretty comfy night until you get into the low twenties/high teens.",

Especially if lighting fires will be risky.  \nEven without the risk of being found a campfire is not a reliable way to keep warm for very long if you want to sleep. A typical campfire will burn down after an hour and since it\u2019s only the bright flames that radiate heat waves out far enough to warm you, you get cold fast and wake up. This happens again and again.   \nIf you\u2019re not in a building made of materials like brick and stone that soak up heat and continue to radiate it back a fire is an unreliable heat source.  \nNext morning you\u2019re groggy from lack of sleep and if this continues you suffer in several ways, mentally and physically.  \nSo anyone with winter outdoor experience would  know this and have a thick, warm bedroll and probably a small tent, especially if they have a horse to carry it.  \nAnd unless they were riding between taverns and inns they\u2019d have to carry food and cooking gear as well so they\u2019d probably have a pack animal.    \nSo even if they were forced to flee and hide in the snowy forest with little time to prepare they\u2019d surely make it a priority to grab whatever bedspreads and robes they could find, fur for preference, wool if necessary. Lack of insulation could mean hypothermia without a fire.     \nWith fur rugs and bedspreads they could make a cosy bed.  \nOther people have mentioned Dakota fire pits but they don\u2019t radiate heat sideways, only straight up, so good for cooking not warmth.  \nIn a snowy forest the wood will be damp and smoky so hard to disguise.",

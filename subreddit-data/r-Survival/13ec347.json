Staying in a clearing near water was a smart move!\n\nI'm sure he'll pack the correct supplies to make shelter, provide warmth and signalling, food, etc.... next time \n\nI no longer hike/backpack, but part of the fun was proper preparation and when he discovers the satisfaction of a well planned and supplied trip, he'll do a Terminator and say ;\n\nI'll be back !",

You can see why a lot of the time you should stay put, it even said in the story they found the marks from his slide.  \n\nOf course we'll probably never know what if any, gear he had with him.  Maybe we can find out but probably no fire making stuff or they would have got him the first search.\n\nI wish we had more details ......\n\nAh ! The NY TIMES version said they found the vehicle first, that's pretty normal too.\n\nLost his water bottle and cell phone and aparantly his shoes in the slide, that's why you need a pocket survival kit on you always not just your pack.",

He always pitches the idea of the single shot shotgun as the best tool for the job because of ammo versatility and inserts that allow for rifle cartridges, but at that point of loading shells with black powder im like dude just carry a smoothbore muzzleloader and put whatever you want down the barrel.  It all seems like over kill.  It\u2019s like the bushcraft version of \u201ctacticool\u201d.",

We'd obviously have water/food as a backup plan, but would something like this be feasible? If so any tips for stuff to get or locations(preferably US) that we could do this in?",

I would grab a fishing rod usually my fly rod and backpacking bag with my sleeping bag, a can of corn beef hash and and maybe some jerky and a flask, a couple water bottles and go. Sometimes I would go on longer trips and others just out to an island on the creek about a half hour away to stay the night. There are rural areas all over the US to do this sort of thing but the west is probably most suited to it.",

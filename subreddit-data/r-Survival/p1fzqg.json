Luckily it was a small enough forest and in a city so that we weren't in any real danger, but big enough that it took 30 extra minutes to get back to where we started from. \n\nI'm glad we got to have a mini \"disaster\" just to really drive home the fact that this shit is pretty dangerous and you need to be cautious and well prepared every time.",

We'd get lost, and end up in a different town.  We'd realize where we were when we finally came to a road.  -then be running back, trying not to get into trouble.  the good old days....",

Maybe a little, but it's important to treat the mountains and wilderness with respect, they'll kill you dead if you are unlucky or aren't prepared.",

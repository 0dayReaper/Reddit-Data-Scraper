    "postText": "Hi survivors, hope you are all doing well!\n\nI came here to ask for a little help.\n\nI\u2019m creating an \u201cEncyclopedia\u201d with lots of PDFs, that i intend to print later (and I\u2019m happy to share here for whoever wants it, after its done)\n\nI wanted to gather as many instructive/educational PDFs i can, with valuable information, regarding everything someone could possibly need in both a Survival situation and a \u201cHunter-Gather\u201d practice.\n\nI\u2019m looking for all kinds of PDFs that have good instructions from (and not only): starting a fire, purifying water, shelter making, techniques of hunting/fishing, instructions on how to open an animal and know what can have good use, taking the skin of something like a caribou to make a blanket, conservative methods for meat and other things, good type of foods that will last a long time, sharpening knife, creating tools, cutting trees, poisonous plants, first aid practices, knots and a lot of other things i cant remember right now.\n\nIf you know/have a website or any place that i could find these type of documents to download, or if you have one (or more) and wants to share, it would be very helpful and it would be very much appreciated!\n\nI have a project for the next years and I\u2019m planning on going to live by myself for a few weeks, on wilderness, without internet, electricity and only an emergency satellite cellphone, and I\u2019m trying to educate myself, learn and gather the most informations i can regarding anything i could possibly need.\n\nThank you for all and any help.",

I think you might be able to download the pages but I'm not sure.\n\nPrinting it out is going to limit how much info you can have, I would recommend keeping it digital but getting a rugged phone/tablet, preferably with an e-ink display for low power usage, and a good combined solar and wind-up power source. It'll cost you a bit but you can have essentially unlimited amounts of text-based info available.",

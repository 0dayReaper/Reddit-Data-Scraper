Do I need to adjust the declination? Does anyone know what else should I do? \n\nThanks\n\nEdit: I was walking and typing, didn't ask my question properly haha.",

Using compasses built for the northern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere can result in the needle dragging and binding. It makes the compass difficult to hold a bearing while walking. It makes shooting an azimuth slower, and makes it harder to hold the compass \"level,\" because the needle is always at a vertical angle aligned with the magnetic fields of the earth.",

The needle will always point to the poles, but that's an oversimplification.The needle is balanced to align with the lines as the compass spins. This rotation is like a tilted helicopter blade. Imagine lines of iron dust being scattered above a piece of paper, over a magnet. All of the lines are curved, but the curve is in 3 dimensions - the paper is flat, but the world is not. The curve is different based on where the lines of dust are. If the needle is balanced to align with lines that run ///// in the northern hemisphere, the lines will run \\\\\\\\\\ in the southern hemisphere. So the needle is carefully tilted and weighted. But there is no space to allow for different angles of tilting in most compasses, and the needle will hit the inside of the compass constantly. If you don't notice it, then when you turn, the needle will stay in one place.  So you'll go the wrong way. Making it \"flat\" won't help if \"flat\" is the wrong angle.",

You can counteract it by tilting the compass but it's a massive pain in the ass so just get one that's good for where you're located or a global one",

The lines of force are a weight on one side, the balance to counteract that force is a weight on the other. When you move the scale, the \"weight\" of the invisible lines is different, it's like taking weights off or putting them on. So the scale shifts. If it shifts too far, it hits the table.",

There are however a ton of literal garbage clones of the model so don't expect a $20 military looking compass is going to be useful.\n\nAs another user pointed out the main killer feature of the M-3 G is the global needle. In addition the Suunto M-3 needle settles considerably faster than the military models and has declination correction built in so you don't have to consider that each time you take a bearing",

You need to adjust declination no matter where you go.\n\nFind a map with the data you need when you get to where you are going and reset your compass. Declination essentially trues your compass to a map. \n\nYou can successfully navigate via compass without a properly set declination as long as you working solo as your compass won't match anyone else's bearings if they are working from another declination.  You also need to establish how vital it is you always know true north and not the relative north your compass will show you.",

The Tupperware can be used to keep any number of things dry.  Survival gear doesn't have to be fancy to be useful.  And those two items are useful in more than one way.",

Aside from the occasional picture or video I shut it off completely to conserve the battery life. Trying to get a signal for some apps to work is sometimes a pain and drains the battery life. Even with apps that don\u2019t need a signal to run. Even though I carry a small portable charger I keep the phone charged and shut off for mostly emergency use. I keep the kindle for entertainment (the battery lasts forever) and my headlamp and flashlight are rechargeable so I mostly have the battery pack as backup for them. There\u2019s a dozen ways to do it and it all comes down to what you\u2019re comfortable using, carrying and keeping it charged. I have a friend who ALWAYS carry\u2019s s mini iPad and iPhone, (both with the otter box cases) solar panel charger, rechargeable ear buds and battery pack whenever he goes out backpacking. All in all his setup adds about 5. Lbs to his load out. I like as light as possible.",

I sometimes do the same with sections of maps or road atlases.\n\nEdit to add: I have also copy/pasted sections of books to create my own \"Cliff-note\" type guide for said books and bound the laminated pages into those plastic prong folders. You could also hand write key points on index cards, paste pics or illustrations on the backs, and laminate those instead.

If it gets too damaged get a new one.\n\nHowever, once you have some experience you'll find the pocket books a lot less useful anyway and you'll need to bring back the sample to compare against a more comprehensive book that you wouldn't be carrying in the field with you.",

Make one that\u2019s more specific for your area. \n\nIt would include plants to eat or for medicines and you could have pictures of the plants from different angles and different seasons. Medicine recipes or procedures. And obviously plants to not eat. \n\nTrees and animals too. How to tan or prepare hides of those animals if possible. What\u2019s a good tree to use to build shelter? \n\nWhat someone carries would be more specific. \n\nStar charts for winter and summer. \n\nFirst aid for possible injuries that could happen in your area. \n\nIs there anything in the woods to look for if you\u2019re lost like a big fire tower or something?",

No wonder I wasn\u2019t having any luck! The humidity here means anything in the shade will not catch from friction and it also means there\u2019s so much vegetation that all the sticks are in the shade. You might have to hike for days to find sunshine.\n\nImagine how the wasted energy and unnecessarily stress people might suffer trying with damp sticks? Your whole survival plan might need to be changed based on this one little tip.\n\nWe need more local guides.",

It\u2019s a main ingredient in a soothing balm that I use on everything from mosquito bites to allergic reactions and minor scraps and burns. More severe burns I\u2019ll just put raw honey directly on the Burt then wrap it so the honey stays in place till it\u2019s healed enough to use the balm then I also use it for my stomach problems and pain although I prefer to use ginger infused honey for stomach issues infused with fresh ginger myself but knowing how to safely harvest just an important first aid ingredient would be super helpful to know I just try to buy from responsible local bee keepers",

More than just \"borrow a strangers cell phone and call a friend\" lol\n\nIt almost happened to me once. We honeymooned by backpacking around south east Asia. We were in some small barely-on-the-map town switching busses. I didn't realize we needed new tickets so I got off to buy them but the bus started to pull off with my wife and all our bags. I had nothing on me, everything was in the bus. I Don't know what I would have done or how I would have tracked her down. Another time we got off a bus at midnight in the wrong city (we mixed up Bago and Bagan). That was an adventure too",

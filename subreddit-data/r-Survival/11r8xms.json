This is what i came up with:\n\n-square plastic cereal box\n-utilty kitchen knife\n-multi-tool\n-bic lighter\n-matches\n-duct tape\n-tea lights\n-paracord with spool\n-1 can of beef stew\n-hand sanitizer\n-safety pin set\n-first aid kit. \n\nI used the duct tape to improvise a sheath for the knife, make small pouches for the safety pins and matches with a piece of the striker, and to seal off the finished kit. \n\nI chose the can of beef stew because it has the highest calorie content of any canned food I found, and the aluminum can was the only other metal container I could find, aside from a dog food bowl.\n\nHand sanitizer can be used to sterilize cuts and also acts as accelerant for a fire. \n\nSafety pins can be used for fishing, and the multi tool contains a can opener for the stew.\n\nI can provide pics once I get home. Does anyone else have similar \"fun\" budget builds?",

I can't imagine a dollar store multi-tool would actually stay in one piece long enough to get the can open. Consider looking for a can of stew with a pull-top instead.\n\nI once opened a can of soup with a screwdriver and a rock, but it took a while and isn't something I'd want to do in a survival situation. And not something I'd be able to do if I were injured. But a pull-top can can be opened with one hand.\n\nAlso, I'd add a bottle of water or 2. You'll need the water before you need the food. Humans can only survive for 3 days without water but you can go 3 weeks without food.",

But I think you should've considered non-canned food. A plastic jar of honey for example would have 10x as many calories for the same weight.\n\nBest of all, the honey has an effectively infinite shelf life even after it has been opened. So you can stretch it out as a supplement to whatever else you can forage/hunt/trap if you need to keep yourself alive for a longer period of time.",

As a midwesterner, I really only do a \"survival\" kit for storm season (which at this point is apparently year round) and was able to get several fitting odds and ends for that. Especially things for my cat, like a small and cheap blanket that I'm fine leaving in a bag basically forever.",

Some minor work had to be done, we had to clear some of the spruce branches on the inside because of the fire hazard inside, they where to dry. That took about 15 minutes and then it was as good as new. If you choose good wood I can see it standing for a very long time. You might need to change the moss on some places from time to time, but if you grab the moss with the dirt and roots it can actually grow on the shelter.\n\n//Adam",

Most common in temperate forests in northeastern North America. Many deciduous trees can be tapped for sap, but sugar maples have the highest sugar concentration. So even if you tap the wrong maple, you can always boil it longer.  I\u2019ve heard of, but never tried birch syrup.",

Syrup isn't a bad option either if you go to the trouble of boiling it, as that can mean a lot of extra calories that you're bound to need, even if the nutrtition is lacking. Where there's trees there's water *somewhere*, so in all likelihood you wouldn't need to drink raw sap to hydrate, though it is an option",

And even if you don't process it for syrup (which isn't the most nutritiously sound option anyway, though probably good calories) you can use it as an adhesive which could have a hundred applications. Supposedly you can even use it to waterproof a shelter",

The water can also be cooked off in a birch bark container using hot rocks put right into the sap.",

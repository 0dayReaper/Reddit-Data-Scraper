It\u2019s not just about lighting a fire and making a cup of tea, despite a lot of what you see on YouTube.  \n\nThere is an overlap with some aspects of survival training, such as navigation in and out of the woods, fire making and first aid, but it\u2019s a hobby, not an emergency plan. \nA bushcrafter will carry tools into the woods with the aim of making what they want/need, which is also a feature of some survival training.\nBut this is survival training as a challenge, an exercise in leaving useful gear at home. \n\nSomeone determined to be prepared to deal with a _real_ emergency, not a survival challenge, does not rely on their ability to make natural shelter or light a fire in the rain, or boil water in a hollow log. Because there is too much that can go wrong and fail in this approach. Especially if they\u2019re injured.  \nSo they carry ready made shelter and insulation and food and a reliable signalling device.     \n\nBecause not to have those things relies too much on luck. The luck to not be too badly injured. The luck to find enough suitable materials when they need them.  \nAnd luck is not a strategy.",

Many survivalists pick up bushcraft skills as part of their survival toolkit, but their focus is broader depending on what they are preparing to survive from. They may learn survival skills other than bushcraft such as emergency medical techniques, self-defense, and communication skills like HAM radio. Bushcraft skills are just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nThe difference is also rooted in intention and motive. Bushcraft is geared towards achieving comfort and sustainability in the wilderness over a longer period of time. It is about long-term outdoor living. The purpose of aquiring survival skills is so you stay alive in emergency situations. They are primarily focused on short-term survival in emergencies until you can make it to civilisation, atleast for me.",

            "comment": "I've been through an extremely intensive \"survival\" course... We did not learn to craft anything at all. We learned to survive. And hide and evade. The idea was not to flourish but to survive.\n\nI would say, the difference between bushcraft and survival is\n\nBushcraft = person goes into the woods/jungle/wilderness with minimal tools and gear and 3 mo ths later he's built a semi permanent shelter, has a chair, has a cooking area, a dedicated bathroom spot, stored wood, and may have started foraging or hunting or fishing and begin the process of building larder of smoked and preserved foodstuffs. A not so great example of this would be the Alone tv series put on by the history channel.\n\nSurvival has as it's sole goal to survive and get home. You might have some of the same skills and maybe even the same gear used by the bushcraft as they do transfer over. But the focus is different. A survivalist may have an axe but may choose not to build a shelter or have a fire as the available calories may be sufficient to see him home in three days if he suffers through a survivable but miserable and cold night. He might choose Not to waste time hunting or fishing because he's booking it out of there. \n\nFor instance, I take completely different gear with me when I'm going to the mountains with my dog for a month, vs hunting. I may hunt when I'm in the mountains, but I'm going there to live and I want to be comfortable so I have the means to process firewood, fish, improve my shelter I've built, feed the dog, feed myself, obtain and purify water and so on. When I hunt, I don't want a fire, a shelter, I don't take anything to build something. Just high calorie snacks and my hunting kit, water etc.\n\nSame goes for my get home backpack. In an urban scenario I have strictly items I need to survive, not live... Where as my shtf go kit is several 200lb buried caches and a trailer I can take with me, and a hidden cabin in the woods and a few other options...",

Of course the answer was a lot of words without any real information.\n\nMy personal opinion: The skills are pretty similar, but in a survival situation your actions should be more to the point. For example, a bushcraft trap will make sure that the animal isn't suffering, you'd rather catch nothing than torture a being. In a survival situation you might not have this luxury and have to take whatever you can get.",

That's bushcraft. It's a solution if I forget my matches and lighter, or lose them somehow. Survival is having matches and a lighter. Survival is also knowing that the best damn way to get a fire going in adverse conditions is to ligt my isobutane backpacking stove under a fistful of pencil thick sticks and call it a day, screw the damn bow and drill. It's cold, damp, I'm chilled through, and I need a fire? I'm getting the stove out. \n\nOr, I can make a shelter out of logs, bark, grapevines, and pine needles. That's bushcraft. It'd  keep me alive if something happened to my tent, thought it'd take all day. Survival is not getting stuck in the woods in the first place without (at a minimum) a poncho and warm clothes for a day hike, and (for overnight hikes) a good tent, mattress, and sleeping bag.\n\nOn the other hand, some bushcraft skills are *really* important to know for survival. Being able to read and navigate over rough terrain, using just a compass and a topo map? Being able to look at the land and pick out the best route up a canyon or down off a ridge, with or without a  map? That's both bushcraft AND survival.\n\nLikewise, being able to read the weather -- what the clouds look like, what the animals are doing, what the air feels and smells like -- that's both a survival skill and a bushcraft skill. \n\nSo, I guess my point is, there's overlap, but survival is more basic, practical, nuts and bolts knowledge on how to be safe and get home alive.",

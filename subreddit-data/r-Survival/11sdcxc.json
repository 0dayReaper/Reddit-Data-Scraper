            "comment": "Not going to rate, but you are missing the most important: Oropharyngeal Airway Kit. If you're  Medic, you'd know what this means. Also, toss those bandages out and get an Israeli Trauma dressing, they are superior to any of the stuff showing on here. I would also add a Straight Catheter kit in 14 French, but then I am a Medic by training. Your mileage may vary. As others stated, you'd want an Lactated Ringers for trauma, not NS, however if that's what you have, it is fine too, but requires cool storage due to it being Crystalloid. Those orange rubber tourniquets are good for IV starting but no good for bleeding control.  My preference for IV needle start is 18 Ga, but 20 Ga is good too. Alcohol Prep pads are Ok, but I'd use Chlorhexadine Prep instead - it does not evaporate quickly, and has better antiseptic properties. And get more Saline flushes - you'll need them. I didn't cover everything, but just enough to take stock of what you got.",

I will grant there may be limited usefulness in case of dehydration but in all cases for emergency use, I would prefer LR. In a survival situation, I don't see the utility of carrying IV fluids. Someone below suggested QuikClot. No. ChitoSam (or similar) is a much better option. QuikClot relies on intrinsic factors to build a clot. ChitoSam does not. If clotting factors are low or depleted, QuikClot won't work. If you are going for tourniquet, opt for a SamXT. The biggest mistake people make with TQs is to not tighten them enough to begin with. SamXT lessens the chance of that. And what is with all of the extra rubber TQs? Each IV start kit you have has one. Why are you packing at least 4 more? They aren't really useful other than blood draw or IV start.",

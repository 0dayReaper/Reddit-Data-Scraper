You can also use a smaller thorn as a barb but the attachment isn't as great.\n\nDryer harder thorns are better  You can use tree sap to reinforce your wrapping. Now whatever string like thing you can use to put the hook in the water. You can also make a simple bobber out of a very dry piece of wood.\n\nNot great compared to a metal hook but it fed humans for centuries so it'll do in a pinch.",

So what we used to do was cut the part of the branch with the thorn, take some twine, stick it into the twine and take the twine fibres and wrap it onto the part of the branch the thorn was on. And do this with loads of times. You'd stick tiny sandworms or shrimp on them and tie them to 2 rock, branches or large pieces of metal like an old anchor. Leave it for the night and check it the next morning. Sometimes you'd have nothing sometimes you had a basket of fish. Ray Mears bushcraft episode Aboriginal Britain on YouTube shows you how to make them with Hawthorns and twine, you should give it a watch",

I would get many of these assuming that it\u2019s a bush and near others and cut them all the same length, there abouts. Then make them into a trap that fish swim into, but drying some 3-4 days in advance, making the barbs sturdy. Then wet new ones for the entry so you get movement and give. They would be able to swim in, the can\u2019t swim back type trap. Where you out the baits make it so you can open there to pull the fish out, so you can re use the trap. \n\nCan also be done with sticks and a knife for faster trap making. I do like to use wet and dry as it makes it slightly more buoyant then pop rocks in it to let it drop to the current, and make it more packed depending on how you built it.\n\nNext time I do one I\u2019ll take a photo and remember to post it",

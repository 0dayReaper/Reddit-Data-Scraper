            "comment": "Not a good idea. Insulated bottles have air between the two layers of steel/aluminum. Air is a poor conductor of heat. So you basically end up burning the bottom of the bottle while barely effecting the liquid inside. Worst case you ruin your bottle, best case it takes forever to heat up.\n\nIf you want a bottle you can place over a heat source, you need a single walled (non-insulated) bottle.",

If it was a survival situation than yes. But you would probably not be able to use it again because whatever the insulation is beteeen the layers would most likely be destroyed as its purpose of use is not direct fire or heat.",

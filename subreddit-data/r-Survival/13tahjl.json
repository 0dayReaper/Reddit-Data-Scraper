It's not best practice, but you're not going to get any teeth to a stage where you're in pain or at risk of losing a tooth in that long.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but I barely brushed for like 5 years while I was very depressed and in an abusive relationship, and yes I had cavities, but I kept all my teeth without even a root canal, and they're all fixed now. Take good care of your teeth when life *isn't* throwing an emergency at you and they can cope with a lot.\n\nIf you're worried about regular camping trips, or the end of the world, (in other words, time that can really add up) toothbrushes cost so little that even the poorest people can stockpile several packs.",

If you can get a poor tasting meal that's 1500 calories for $5, or a fairly delicious (comparatively) one for $3 that is only 490 calories, that's an obvious value difference. That difference wouldn't be enough to justify eating unpleasant food if you're just ultralight backpacking every third weekend. \n\nOn a survival forum, the concept of bulk comes into play. You need *lots* of food stored. Food isn't your only expense if you really are prepared. So you have to make financial decisions that might affect comfort, pleasure, preference, and ... flavor. \n\nFor a family of four,  if you manage to get a days worth of food down to the low cost of $3 per person, a years food is $4380. \n\nAt $5 a person, it goes up to $7300.  \n\nI could do the math to connect the caloric values, and how it's an exponential amount, but I think y'all get it. \n\nPeople who are into survival usually aren't wealthy. So they have to buy bang for their buck, value first, for things that have to bought in high quantities.",

After about 7 years out, I still haven't found a great replacement for MREs. \n\nAnd some of them are actually pretty delicious. Maybe its because I ate them so much, but there are a few of them that I'd eat over some fast food chains.\n\nBut its hard to beat out such a highly researched meal plan, with a great spread of minerals, vitamins, nutrients, that can sustain the average adult for several days on just one MRE, that's lightweight and can easily be packed on an individual load.",

Here's one https://readywise.com/products/hunting-breakfast-and-entree-kit that prices out to $7/pouch.  There is lots of price gouging bougie people like your example, but let's not pretend those are your only options. And if you're willing to spend hundreds (or long term: thousands) on MREs, you have even more long term options to make them yourself for comparable prices.\n\nAlso keep in mind the MRE is a kit. The comparable item within the MRE, the single pouch of \"entree\", has less than half the calories of a typical camping pouch-meal. It is then supplemented with food that you, as a camper/postapocalypticroleplayer could easily acquire yourself for cheaper than MRE prices such as crackers, raisins, candy, PB+J, etc. That's where the bulk of the calories come from in an MRE.\n\n280 calories per entree pouch on average according to this page citing HPRC-online.org - https://www.ruckformiles.com/mre/how-many-calories-in-an-mre/",

Cheaper than an MRE or anything pre-prepared. But I have a couple MREs on hand that I can throw in a bag for a spontaneous trip.\n\nIt's not perfect for every use-case, but it is good for certain use cases. For long term survival, your best bet is likely dried and canned goods, because bugging in is typically a better option than bugging out. I'm not stocking up on massive quantities of MREs, freeze drieds, or any other \"backpacking\" solutions for an actual emergency, so realistically either way I go I'm spending at most $100 a year on this type of item (typically much less).

What little overspray there will be is generally covered by the buffer zones that they're required to have.\n\nPlus they're routinely audited with soil samples/etc to check for chemicals.\n\nFinally at least where I live, most of the organic farms are surrounded by other organic farms. Because they tend to be about 50% more profitable for the farmer than the same farm selling produce with chemicals. If the farmer knows how to grow organic food, then they will. And if there's a farm next door showing them how to do it, then they sure as hell are going to copy them.\n\nYou're kidding yourself if you think a tiny bit of roundup overspray (enough that the certifiers will still consider the produce organic) is worse for you than an MRE which contains about *four times* more salt than you should be eating in a meal. The roundup *might* kill you. We absolutely know salt will kill you (heart attack) if you eat too much regularly, and four times the recommended amount is definitely too much.",

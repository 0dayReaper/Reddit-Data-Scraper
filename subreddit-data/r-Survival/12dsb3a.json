TLDR; Biomechnically tumplines are better for your back as it more evenly distributes the load over your center of mass vs offsetting it with a heavy backpack. I could go into lots of detail of how that\u2019s better for us but that\u2019s the gist of it",

We have center of gravity and base of support. Center of gravity is the \u201cmid point\u201d where the weight of said person is concentrated, and base of support is the area between our feet that allows us to comfortably balance. \n\nWhen center of gravity is situated nicely in the base of support, then we achieve nice centerline balance, basically it doesn\u2019t take much effort to keep ourselves upright. When our center of gravity goes outside of our base of support that\u2019s when we risk falling, being unable to balance etc..\n\nWhen we wear a heavy backpack, we shift our center of gravity towards our back offsetting that nice centerline balance we had without the backpack. Thus in order to keep ourselves balanced, we must compensate through muscular activation to keep our body upright. Because we\u2019re compensating and still standing upright with a pack on, we constantly will have a bending force on our spine. The backpack is pulling us back down from the back, and our muscles pull us up to compensate but the force is still there.\n\nIf we were to carry that very same load with a tumpline providing good surface area like the one in this picture that\u2019s worn properly, we would  not expect that bending force. If we put the tumpline on and bend our body forward from the hips until we achieve that centerline balance then the force of that pack will instead run through your body and spinal column instead of off of it. The tumpline will provide a compressive force from the top of your skull all the way down your spinal column which is actually ideal with how the human body is designed. The spine is fantastic at handling compressive forces, it deals with them daily with us just standing/walking around.\n\nIt\u2019s like stacking books, you can keep putting more and more ontop as they can handle the forces being applied very well but if you try hanging off a heavy object off the side, it\u2019s all gonna tumble down\n\nDoes this mean we should all ditch backpacks and use tumplines day to day? Probably not but this was just a fun argument I had to present when getting my degree :)",

Our head is pretty heavy and we've evolved and grown up carrying that weight all day every day. Adding a bit more weight doesn't hurt. Our shoulders shoulders are an unnatural and unfamiliar place to carry a weight.\n\nIt's generally recommended to limit backpacks to between 10% and 20% of your body weight.\n\nStudies have shown with practice you can carry up to 20% of your body weight on your head with almost *zero* measurable effort. Breathing, heart rate, etc are identical to carrying nothing.\n\nIt's only really when you carry stupidly heavy loads that head carrying can be a problem.",

There was no statistically significant evidence suggesting injuries were more prevalent with tumplines. Improper usage would cause concerns with straining neck/back though but that can also be said the same for a backpack if that isn\u2019t used right. Backpacks are a bit more intuitive/easier to use in general though\n\nEdit: more info. The sherpas in Nepal almost exclusively use tumplines to carry hundreds of pounds of equipment to the different base camps on Everest, the research is a bit hard to find but you can begin by looking into their historical use as well as the cultural use of carrying objects over the head in places like Asia/Africa.",

Ideally the tumpline will sit on top of your head to allow the center of mass to situate more in the middle of your center of balance, thus the weight is distributed more evenly around your body. To properly compensate for heavy weight you would bend your hips forward not your back. Your spine is fantastic at managing compression forces from gravity since it deals with it everyday.",

The weight goes straight down your spine.  Way, way easier than having a large load pulling back on your arms and shoulders.  I have a tump line on the large pack I use when canoeing.  Trust me - it's the way to go.",

When portaging, you must carry everything somehow and a tumpline helps a great deal\u2014like the voyageurs and practically every indigenous peoples around the globe did or do. \u201cDuring the fur trade, voyageurs and coureurs de bois adopted the tumpline to ease the burden of carrying their heavy gear, canoes and bundles of fur across various terrain.\u201d\u2014the Canadian encyclopedia. Seriously a huge help\u2014can even carry a canoe with one in lieu or as well as a thwart and makes carrying that canoe a great deal easier. I find them particularly helpful when the terrain is difficult. Very finicky to get set up and to get used to but give it a try!",

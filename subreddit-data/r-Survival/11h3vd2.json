    "postText": "Spotting the difference between elm (Ulmus spp.) trees can be challenging, because they look so similar. In this video I give you background information on 2 common species of elm (slippery and American elm), and show you how to tell one apart from the other. If you'd like to learn more about the differences of slippery and American elm, here is the link: [https://youtu.be/DizrzkVct10](https://youtu.be/DizrzkVct10)",

If I recall correctly it also has some antiseptic and antibiotic properties, so if you make it into a poultice it can help keep wounds from getting infected.",

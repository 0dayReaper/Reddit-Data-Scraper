Its a very unique feeling of helplessness. \n\n\nI'd stopped struggling and stopped sinking, but eventually realized that I was still in danger from exposure (it was early spring) and from the incoming tide. I managed to wiggle my feet out of my boots and use my arms to drag my ass out, over the course of about 15 minutes. \n\n\nI ended up having to throw away every piece of clothing I'd been wearing, and everything in my pockets was trashed. Shit sucked.",

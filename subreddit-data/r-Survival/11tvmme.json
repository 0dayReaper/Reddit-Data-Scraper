            "comment": "Fellow Ontario resident OP.  When I was growing up in the 60s and 70's we winter camped in several of the provincial parks and in Gatineau Park in Quebec.  We would build snowgloos using our snowshoes and I have to say the switch to modern snowshoes made that task much more difficult.\n\nYou demonstrated very well that the whole process to preparing for night is very time consuming and energy sapping and I assess many underestimate it is a multi-hours task.  I think for the effort you expended in making the shelter demonstrated in the video I prefer the snowgloo option unless there is insufficient snow for the task.  Normally alone I could get one fully built, burrowed and the small fire going to create the inner shield wall in about 90-120 min.    They are superb protection from storms.\n\nWere I to be doing it today I would probably cheat and have in my equipment one of those lovely new collapsible aluminum shovels - they weigh almost nothing and make the task immensely easier.\n\nSomething I really like that you demonstrated - the value of choosing dry wood and a huge supply of tinder.\n\nAnd I agree, when it gets really, really cold at night (-30 and colder) it is very hard to get a good nights sleep.  I recall one occasion where we went with the trench method for shelter but it dipped below -40 and if I got 10 minutes of sound sleep that night it was a miracle.\n\nYour bucksaw and axe mask are awesome.\n\nThe care with which you made this demonstration video and the annotations are excellent.  Thank you.",

You could make a stronger and fuller frame from splitting tree trunks and cutting it into flat sides then using those for the lean-to\n\nWhy not pile more wood over the fire using the logs as a stand on both sides?\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of carrying a hatchet and a saw if they do more or less the same thing?\n\nSome of these I have an idea as to the awnser but just getting a confirmation.

                    "comment": "Great questions! Happy to give my take on them. \n\n1) the fire was far enough away and it was cold enough that the snow only melted a tiny bit if any, on the upper part of my shelter. Through the night, the flame was extremely small, and heat didn\u2019t spread much farther than my body. \n\n2) splitting the trunks would have been too much work, and I used the saplings I had already cut the boughs from. 2 birds with one stone I suppose, they held well enough. \n\n3) I could have piled more wood but was crunched for time and felt this would be enough.  I had to choose carefully what to do with my small window of daylight. \n\n4) I like the Axe saw combo because they are both generally used in felling trees. The saw will cut wood to length, the axe splits the wood, and the axe additionally can limb the trees. Some people will use one or the other, my saw weighs only 1lbs and is stored in the same case as my axe. So I always bring them together. \n\nHope this helps! Just my opinion here",

But that was because I'm annoyed by what in my eyes is a \"the old ways were better\" posing.\n\nWhich north trappers? I'm seriously asking, as Google image search came back with very unspecific results for me. I did look at what modern Inuit wear, and saw mostly traditional fur clothes, and cheap modern synthetics.\n\nWhat is staple, is not very relevant. The biggest factor, determining staple, is affordability. There is a world of difference, between what people wear in their predictable everyday routine, and on an expedition/long trek in the wild. The staple in Siberia are valenki+galoshes. Cheap and get the job done. But no one would try that on a trek. A major factor when alone in the wilderness, is hedging risk.\n\nI absolutely would prefer a 1.5 kg nylon tent and a warm sleeping bag, to a 10 kg prospector tent. The video was of a guy trekking to a location, spending the night there, then moving on. Not prolonged living in the same spot. That sleigh won't climb 25%+ slopes on its own. And even if there are no slopes, I don't want to drag a 30kg sleigh in soft snow.\n\n&gt;Maximizing thermal insulation would be a huge rookie mistake on that hike in.\n\nOf course. But with modern tech clothes, what you don't need, would easily be taken off. Or partially unzipped, unlike that traditional all-or-nothing canvas thing. What I'd keep on me is:\n- if windy - base layer + IR reflective tech shell, with vents under armpits and main zipper open as much as I need them\n- if no wind - base layer + some mid layer, no shell. Even more breathable than the canvas shell\n\nBut really, my question is, what happened with the bits of snow/ice trapped on the branches that guy lay on. With a synthetic shell, we know it doesn't soak in. And what happens when he is injured and has to spend time laying/siting in the snow. What happens when that \"once every 25 years mid-winter rain\" catches him by surprise. Or when ice cracks and he falls in water. With synthetic shell, you just shake the water off. Your base layer is soaked, but at least you can have your IR-reflective shell dry and trapping a warm air bubble around you.\n\nAbout sleeping under a dead tree like that, I won't presume to judge risk by few seconds of video. All I'm saying is, there is a moment between now and 10 years from now, when that trunk falls. The guy was certain enough to stake his life that the moment wouldn't be that night.\n\nThe magnesium lighter posing has become a de-facto standard in survival videos nowadays. And you know what else has became a standard? Cutting the middle of the fire-lighting scene, to hide how much of the scarce winter daylight it wasted. The guy brought a saw but not a Bic lighter?  To me, that's posing, not a lesson in survival.\n\nI'd accept the video as a demonstration that \"the old folksy ways still work\". But not (what seemed to me like) its suggestions that they work better than modern quality equipment.",

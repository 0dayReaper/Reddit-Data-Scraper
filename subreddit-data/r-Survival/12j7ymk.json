The ones that surpass that can live in water beyond boiling, so that's a moot point.",

Different bacteria can survive different temps for different times. If someone thinks that water boils at a set temperature regardless of elevation, this could lead to problems with their sterilization. Therefore, yes, it depends on your elevation.\n\nBoiling water for 1 minute at 10,000 feet is *not* the same as boiling water for 1 minute at sea level.",

By the time the pasta's done and cooked through the water will be fine too.\n\nI've made several hundred batches of ramen noodles or mac n' cheese in the back country this way. Not dead yet.\n\nA couple tips:\n\n* Best way to collect the water is with a plastic bottle submerged *well* below the surface of the water, and a couple of feet above the bottom, even in 'clear' water.  This helps eliminate most surface floaters, and mosquito larva from the bottom of the lake. Boiled larva probably won't hurt you (free protein) but the thought is kinda ick. \n* If you can't accomplish that, filter the water through a coffee filter. If you don't have a coffee filter, a washrag or bandanna or clean article of clothing will work.\n* If the water is full of sediment let it sit in a container overnight for everything to settle out.\n\nIf the water is stagnant or full of minerals/toxins/etc., no amount of boiling will make it safe.\n\nNote: If you're at high elevation, the pasta may take longer to cook.",

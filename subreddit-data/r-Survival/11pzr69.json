A festival with a hundred thousand people might have hundreds of tents left behind for example, and of course other kit.\n\nVolunteering at a festival, I found an abandoned $3,000 guitar once while packing up a stage into long term storage. I found the owner in that case (it took a couple hours - they were passed out somewhere), but for less valuable things I wouldn't have a problem keeping them.\n\nSome people will be going straight to the airport and can't take their gear on the flight anyway, so they don't bother packing it up. Or they might be hung over/drunk/worse and need to get a lift with friends home who are leaving _now_ so no time to pack up the tent. You won't be the only person scavenging through abandoned campsites.",

My wife and I scored so many awesome finds. I still have a $150 camp chair I d ores for 15 bucks because the seam on the cup\nHolder was torn. Fixed it in 29 minutes and I still have it 15 years later\u2026 sadly they no longer do that, now they have a used gear store in Manhattan beach where the prices on used gear are literally 5-10 percent off full price for gear that looks like it has been hate fucked by a gang of elephants\u2026 once in a very great while you can get a decent deal but not very often. I usually peruse Offer Up and sometimes can find good deals, but for the essentials I save up and pay full price. Especially if I can get something with a lifetime warranty.",

But I've heard the older generation before that was terrible.\n\nI have a machete that was originally designed to military standards (they don't issue machetes anymore, but people still buy them, so the company continued production).\n\nJust beware a lot of stuff is fake. I bought my stretcher for $50 off a retired (injured I think) soldier on facebook marketplace. He said he'd never actually used it. The machete I purchased new.\n\nThe other good thing is whatever faults they have, there will be detailed advice online how to mitigate the issue \u2014 e.g. my machete needed to have the anti-rust coating sanded off - apparently it tends to trap moisture and rust under the coating.",

That's where you will find the people who don't know what their gear is worth or just don't care and want it gone, but you will also find a lot of bad deals so make sure you know what you're looking at and what it's actually worth. If you're at a yard sale dont be afraid to ask about things you're looking for but don't see displayed. You never know what else someone might have and want to sell.\n\nThere are plenty of low price and low quality/performance items for sale on amazon. Read reviews and hope for the best.\n\nJoin some Facebook or reddit buy and sell groups. You won't score any great deals, but you can find higher quality used items for a fair price.\n\nIn my experience, modern surplus stores sell garbage. It's either worn out, obsolete, or both. A lot of what they sell isnt actually surplus or anything close to government issue but instead overpriced made in china garbage. Many things they sell are gimmicky solutions looking for problems. The new cheap stuff on Amazon will perform at least just as well and anything better is night and day. But that's just the majority of the stores I have been to.

I've picked up several camelback bladders, hiking boots, trekking poles, a great camping hammock, and even a Ka-Bar at a garage sale before. \n- Watch for the Clearance. Most outdoors stores run a clearance of warehouse event once or twice a year around the change of seasons (winter to spring, summer to fall) where you can snag name brand gear for half off or more. Academy recently did their spring sale and I snagged three waterproof lockable tackle boxes for $5 each.",

I have a day pack for hiking and I usually have water, some granola bars, a poncho in case of rain, a spare pair of socks, a ferro rod, and a survival version of a leatherman. In a pinch I would want the last two as the first will enable me to make a fire and the second will enable me to make almost anything else.",

Obviously clothing, any type of insulation helps but if you're totally exposed.. God forbid you're soaked either due to sweat during the day or rain/sleet/snow. It's a serious problem. Ya gotta stay hydrated but risking a stomach bug is one of those calculations you gotta make when you have access to potentially safe drinking water.

For water, it's a really advanced skill to fabricate something to boil water in, let alone something to carry it in, your Grayl suggestion achieves both and the poncho can collect rainwater or be turned into a reservoir for longer ranges between water.",

He slipped off the trail on a steep spot a few years before, and a few hundred yards from where I met him! He said he had a compound ankle fracture, and then it started pouring. He had a poncho and a Garmin InReach He threw the poncho over a downed log, crawled under the poncho, wrapped up in a blanket of some kind, and waited for help to arrive. S&amp;R got there, determined packing him out on foot wasn't possible, and called a helicopter. He got a thrill ride to the trailhead at the end of a rope under a chopper, and then a lift to the ER.)",

I\u2019m not going to be wasting time with a ferro rod fire, just get the thing going immediately so I can start to work out the rest of the not dying. The answer is always to try and walk yourself out though, you\u2019ll just be wasting away slowly without more gear. Make a decent split for the ankle and trudge out if need be. Most people carry all the food they need to walk out on their body and if you can\u2019t purify water you\u2019re not going to last long anyways, better off drinking running water a bunch at a time and dealing with parasites and what not when back in civilization.",

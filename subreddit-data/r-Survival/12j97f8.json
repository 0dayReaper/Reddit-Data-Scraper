I think o paid $15 CDN for it delivered. Some basic stuff but some slightly more advanced. Great investment.\n\nBut keep in mind books like this are not for learning skills, they\u2019re for reinforcing skills you\u2019ve already learned. What that means is learn your shit NOW before you need it\u2026. Then you just reinforce what you\u2019ve already learned and already know once you\u2019re out in the bush using the book for reinforcement.",

I recommend for someone starting to try ***Cody Lundin's 98.6 Degrees, the art of how to keep your ass alive.***\n\nIt has some great illustrations, some cartoon depictions to help you understand how many people go down for good, and things you can do to keep yourself alive.\n\nAfter that, there are a number of ways you can go, but generally I recommend staying away from the US Army survival manuals, as they are as dry as the desert, and in some cases offer discredited information such as solar stills.  (a discussion for another day) However you can usually find copies of some of them at Barnes &amp;  Nobles on the discount rack.  There is a decent on called the ***United States Air Force Search and Rescue Survival training*** manual that is decent.  It is about 1.5 inches thick.  with lots of information that you will likely never use.\n\nThe SAS Survival book is pretty good. I noticed someone mentioned it.\n\nLen McDougall's, ***New and Revised Practical outdoor survival book, A modern approach to staying alive in the wilderness*** is pretty decent. As it:\n\n*John D. McCann's* ***Stay alive, Survival skills you need***\n\nWhen you are comfortable with the information, study some of the older books such as:\n\n*Townsend Whelen and Brandord Angier's* ***On your own in the Wilderness***\n\nand:\n\n*Calvin Rutstrum's* 1958 book, ***The new way of the Wilderness.***\n\nBoth of which are  heavy in woodcraft and outdoor skills that you will really need if you want to get really good. There are a whole bunch of other books listed and some specialty books for Desert and Sea Survival which are listed here: (doug Ritters equipped to survive website.  He no longer updates it as he does a lot of lobbying for survival products, but he also has an excellent survival forum that has some very knowledgable people you can bounce things off of, and ask for opinions.  The Site is here:\n\n[http://www.equipped.com/](http://www.equipped.com/)\n\nThe massive list of survival books is found here: [**http://www.equipped.com/books.htm**](http://www.equipped.com/books.htm)\n\nHe also lists several books that recount how people in survival situations survived and what worked for them and what did not.\n\nAnd the survival forum is here: [http://forums.equipped.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=cfrm](http://forums.equipped.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=cfrm)\n\nIncidentally the best place to find some of these is generally [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), especially the older books.  You can find used copies and save some money!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnjoy!",

Physically demanding, all.\n\nWilderness Survival is regularly noted as one of the most popular not-required-for-Eagle merit badge.\n\nFirst aid! \n\nScouts shoot guns and, uh, archery ... with bows, they learn to clean and care for shotguns, rifles and muzzleloaders. Fishing is a great merit badge.\n\nOh, and camping!\n\nLord Robert Baden-Powell shifted his vision of scouting to be an international peace movement after the number of people -- many young scouts -- died in World War II was so huge. But the focus on outdoor life didn't change. Youth-led scouting taught me a lot about leadership, character building, and caring about others... all transferable survival skills!\n\nSo you are in great shape, as scouting is a great jumping off point for outdoor skills, including survival. \n\nAnd of course, I love the...

It\u2019s a mentality of keeping your cool under life threatening pressure. If it wasn\u2019t, survival would be a walk in the park.\n\nThink about it. You\u2019re surviving every day, you know exactly what you need to do every day to maintain your level of comfort. But you also are in that same survival situation every single day. You get a lot of practice. A lot of what you do becomes so routine you don\u2019t think about it. You don\u2019t need to make fire, but you need to pay a gas bill. You don\u2019t need to purify water, but you are real good at hitting your turn signal before you make a left hand turn in your car. It\u2019s quite similar in the end, we just take it for granted because it\u2019s so mundane.\n\nThe best way to learn how to survive is to do it. Thrust yourself into situations that require you to adapt to your environment in new ways. Maybe you go camping without a lighter. Or a knife. Or cordage. Maybe you go fishing without a hook, or a fishing rod. How are you going to adapt and overcome your shortcomings in those situations? \n\nPractice surviving in this way and build skills and experience solving problems. You don\u2019t have to put your life in danger to do this. Keep a journal and record issues you struggled with. Also things you did well or in a new way. Reflect and devise approaches you can try next time, until you start getting it right every time. Soon you will be able to apply these kind of experiences and the knowledge and skill borne from them to other aspects of survival. You\u2019re probably already doing this anyway.\n\nBAS is good. I learnt a lot from them as well that I still apply in my life 30 years later. There\u2019s a reason why most of the stuff you read in books was already covered by them. But knowing that stuff is only half the battle. Being able to apply that knowledge in the field is what\u2019s important, and even more important is to be familiar enough with those motions that they become routine, and easily adapted to different environments/situations.",

            "comment": "Most \"survival\" books will cover general basic information, that can be applied almost anywhere. Stuff like navigation, signalling, shelter, fire, water, food and first aid. If you're claiming to already have mastery of all those subjects, then you just need to branch out. \n\nI recommend moving on to more niche and specialized topics. Learn to ID plants and mushrooms. Learn animal tracking, and trapping and hunting. Learn new and more advanced knots and lashing, even weaves and braids. The pool is very deep, when it comes to things that you can learn to give you an edge in a wilderness survival scenario. It doesn't begin and end with a lean-to shelter and a campfire. Which is why nobody has tried to make a truly universal \"all-in-one\" survival bible. Between all the variables, there's simply too much to fit in one book. You have to consider things like regional climate, specific location, the season, the elevation, the geography in general. Even local geological features, the state of migratory populations, down to the recent history of the location. For example, is the area rebounding from a wildfire or flood that occurred in the last few years? That can have a huge impact on what resources are and aren't available to you. \n\nMy point is, you just need more books. You won't find one book anywhere on this earth than covers *everything*. My bookshelf is filled with books on *specific* subjects, like plant and mushroom ID, trapping, woodworking, bushcraft, rural skills and technology etc.\n\nEdit: For some context, I went to school for Natural Resources and Conservation Enforcement. It **really** opens your eyes, about just how many things are at play in any given population, alone community, ecosystem or biome.",

Pretty much all reputable survival manuals have the same basic stuff in them that will help you survive, the rest it just extra technique that differentiates them from the others. Thats not a bad thing, but survival always comes down to your mental state and mastery of the basics. Take that Boy Scout manual and practice every task until you feel confident that you have mastered it in various extreme conditions.   If you\u2019ve done that, your mental state will be what it needs to be. \n\nIf you need a deeper dive, I recommend \u201csurviving the extremes\u201d by Kenneth Kamler MD. \nIt gives a medical perspective of what the body needs and why some things work and some don\u2019t, which will help prioritize the basics you have mastered, but in the end, survival is a basic task, everything else is living and thriving.",

Why do you presume they missed anything important? \n\nI would suggest you maybe don't need more books on survival but instead you should read books about people out there surviving and [learn by example](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/survival-stories) instead. And, yes, I'm including fictional accounts as well.",

I know what you\u2019re talking about and I wouldn\u2019t do anything like that unless it\u2019s more of a canvas jacket. However with canvas I\u2019ve experienced that it\u2019s not as breathable. You might wanna see if Carhartt or Duluth Trading might have more durable waterproof rain gear. My jacket (the Eddie Bauer one) is definitely meant for hiking with a backpack on in terms of wear and tear.",

I expect 20-40 years of usage for each jacket.\n\nThe total cost, not adjusted to anything, of these two jackets is 400 euros. That's for both of them so it means something like 5-20 euro a year for the privilege of having two jackets(one of them is nice red and can be worn to any restaurant).\n\nIs the 60 euro HH jacket cheaper than my two jackets for 400 euros? Most def.\n\nIs it cheaper per use? Doubt it.\n\nIf I want to get cheapest at the moment I'll go with whatever brand offers the best price at the moment and that's usually an unknown brand of a brand launching in a new market.",

For $150 you'll struggle to find something like that but check out the usual outdoors companies; Patagonia, Marmot, North Face, RAB, Arc'teryx (mmmmmm), Outdoor Research, REI, etc all make good hardshells.\n\nIf you need more durable then look for a technical softshell jacket, they give up some water resistance in favor of a tougher fabric usually with some stretch to it. Still water resistant but will wet out pretty quickly after the water repellant coating on the fabric is diminished. \n\nIf you're looking for more of the \"bushcraft/survivalist\" jacket then you want waxed canvas. Gonna be the toughest, cheapest, and longest lasting option but also the heaviest, least weatherproof, hottest, and most cumbersome. Carhartt make great affordable canvas jackets which you can wax yourself if desired, Fjallraven make some real nice synthetic canvas waxed jackets at a higher price, and then a lot of the hunting/fishing brands also have options...LL Bean, Cabela's, Orvis, etc.\n\nIf you need one jacket to do it all I'd recommend a tough hardshell cuz it can do everything. But those are gonna be the most expensive. If you don't mind the weight and lack of weatherproofing of canvas jackets then that would be your cheapest option. You can get them insulated or uninsulated depending on your climate. \n\nI have been using a North Face Apex Flex jacket for about 5 years, it's kind of a hybrid hard/softshell jacket and it's been amazing for me, I layer under it if needed and it's 100% waterproof. I use it for hiking, yard work, cool weather shell, etc. I try not to get it too dirty cuz as a technical fabric it needs to be washed with special detergent and that is annoying. So I also have a carhartt for harder use and dirty chores, that's my hunting/chainsaw/farm coat. It's not waterproof at all but it is bombproof! \n\nAnd then obviously in warmer weather you want a lighter jacket, that's where your standard \"rain jacket\" shines. Thinner more breathable fabric, lighter weight, not as many technical features, but still waterproof. That's your Patagonia Torrentshell, Marmot Precip, etc. You can get them for under $150 easily but you need to be a bit more careful with them. \n\nI didn't feel like getting into too much detail cuz it's boring and I'm not an expert anyway, but a lot of the properties of a waterproof jacket come down to the fabric/membrane/coating system that's used. People have recommended to you GoreTex Pro jackets and 3-layer jackets, that refers to the fabric. GT Pro is their toughest version, it's a 3-layer (backing fabric/waterproof-breathable membrane/Face fabric) and therefore is thicker and stronger than their 2.5/2-layer options. As such it's used to make alpine hardshells, cold weather fishing jackets, etc. It's also very pricey... there are other brands that make comparable 3-layer fabrics for cheaper but GoreTex is the gold standard (like it or not, and I was a big fan of eVent).",

They are mainly focused on rain gear for fisherman so they have to be pretty tough to deal with abrasive ropes, cables, metal cages, etc.\n\nI am an arborist and climb trees for a living. I need something that can hold up to rough trees and gear. I bought their Weatherwatch jacket which is mid level on durability but breathable and their Neptune bibs which is a pretty high level on durability. The Neptune is not breathable but very tough. The jacket still gets sweat developed on the inside but frankly they all do when I am climbing. I bought both to try out both lines and see if one needs replacing excessively early. Both have been great but it's only been a few months.",

I used to try and buy expensive name brand jackets. The only thing other than Froog Toggs that truly stays 100% waterproof is PVC, but it doesn't breath or flex.\n\nI have had this jacket for 5 years, using it as my around town jacket and take it with me backpacking. It stands up to branches and thorns and it's light weight. It's stiff but breaks in to feel like cotton after a few dozen wears. I'm 180lbs and 6'0 and I wear the XL as a size guide\n\nEdit with link. Prices have gone up a touch, but this is the ultimate raincoat IMO and you get bonus pull over pants. No pockets though.   https://www.amazon.com/FROGG-TOGGS-All-Sport-Waterproof-Breathable/dp/B00HR6TSZ8?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1",

They have a canvas duck material that is combined with nylon threads to increase water resistance. The material is now called Superdux, but was called something else when I bought the jacket. It has kept me bone dry in snow/wet snow/freezing rain, but I've never been in a daylong downpour or anything. It is very resistant to sparks and tears. Two years of winter use and abuse, it's holding up great, but obviously two years is not long enough to know how truly durable it is, so grain of salt. They have a line of these jackets for different temps/levels of precipitation: https://www.carhartt.com/SuperDux-TT\n\nHope that helps.",

Goretex is awesome for water repellancy but can rip on sharp branches, particularly in freezing temps, when it gets more brittle and loses some of its breathability. Any synthetic material, such as Goretex, will get pinholes from sparks. Of course you can always combine it with a cheap flannel jacket or something that you throw on over it to protect it when doing particularly rugged and manly tasks like wood gathering or moustache grooming.",

You could also just wear a teeshirt, and trap zero sweat but the rain will soak you and you will go hypothermic.  \n\nSo you will have to find a happy medium where you accept a little wetness from the rain, and a little from sweat, to stay overall dry enough to stay safe.

I don't have experience with it yet but it gets great reviews and seems very durable.\n\nFor a bigger budget, I would consider KUIU. I have the AXIS Hybrid Pant and they're AWESOME - super durable, very warm, and completely waterproof in snow from my experiences. I imagine their rain jackets are also top notch.",

I bought the mandall because I was on a tight budget, but here's all their work wear ackets. I would trust their work wear lines over their casual lines, for durability.\n\nhttps://www.hhworkwear.com/en_ca_ww/men/jackets/rain-jackets",

I use it for work since I spend most of my day outside and haven\u2019t had an issue since I bought it. Everything beads off so all I have to do is give it a quick shake and I\u2019m dry again.",

Remember, it's for survival, not comfort. Insulation and moisture wicking have to be solved underneath, this is basically a worn umbrella.\n\nI live in a small sailboat sailing mostly subarctic waters, I have wprn through a lot of gear for wet protection. \"Rubber clothes\" is the only kind that will last hard wear and keep you sheltered from rain/water. Goretex and such membranes will stop being effective, and needs special wash and care to stay functional. In survival, you're unlikely to be able to maintain membrane for more than one cycle of use, which normally spans less than a couple days of rain. I had HH Aegir, Patagonia, various membrane stuff, all have failed in the membrane and/or been worn down at exposed points (elbows, underarms, shoulders, necks, zips and seams). They will fail you. On the other hand, rubber is easily inspected, cleaned, and repaired by vulcanizing tape or glue, which have more uses than f ex membrane wash and impregnation solutions has...\n\nForget pockets, they will fuck up the best of rubber coats. Get coats with slits so you can reach pockets in the layer underneath instead..",

They are not waxy feeling. They breathe in that they are rain proof, yet won't make you sweat. They look great. Hand made also. Check these out.

It has two relatively big pockets and a game bag on the back, and the cloth is in a ripstop configuration, so tears will not spread easy. It's not the most breathable thing and if you use it without a long sleeve layer under it, , it'll become uncomfortable when you start sweating, although the inner mesh helps a good deal",

It went through the deployment pretty unused, but since it has been an outer layer for cold weather off road motorcycling for years and gone out in many winter and fall storms (I do snow and tree cleanup), still looks and works like new.\n\nIt's amazing how thin, yet completely impervious it is. With a wool sweater underneath, it's an oven in 15\u00b0 F.\n\nThat said, a good Sherpa lined, cotton shell Carhartt is a lot more comfortable for every day...

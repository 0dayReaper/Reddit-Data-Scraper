There was good material on the downstream ends of sand bars so we\u2019re sampling those. He walked out to the end of a bar and sunk in to his shins. As he tried to move he just kept settling and was quickly submerged to his thighs. I found some logs and other debris and made a structure out to him. He finally managed to sit on a board, pull his legs out from his waders to free himself. Then he worked on freeing his waders for about another half hour but finally got them out. We did wonder what would have happened if we would not have been paired up.",

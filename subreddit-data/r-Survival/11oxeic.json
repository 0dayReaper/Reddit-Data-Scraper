That isn't perfect either, but I found it easier to file that into a shape that works.",

Also, a small piece of thin steel, which comes with some ferro rods, works well.\n\nAfter seeing the ceramic scraper, I experimented, using a shard of broken glass found on the roadside. I used a cloth wrap to protect my hands, but carefully filing down most of the edges would work too.  It's as good or better at generating sparks than anything made of steel. It is harder than steel.\n\nI'd see this as a temporary solution, not as EDC. But I did indeed take a small piece of roadway glass back into the Sierra, but I generally didn't need to start campfires on that trip.\n\nA shard of broken ceramic would be safer than broken glass, but still should involve a way to protect oneself.",

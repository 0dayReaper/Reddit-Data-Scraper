Mine are spares, for if I drop my main pair over or they happen to break.\n\nEasiest way to skin smaller ones is fish in one hand, slice the skin behind the spines and a 'v' cut down past the dorsal spine. Take the pliers and grab a corner of hide and pull, then get the other side and pull, alternating sides to keep somewhat the same on both, then you'll have a flap on their belly, pull it to the head, and then slide the knife under the dorsal spine and cut to the bottom of its head, dress and/or filet it as normal.\n\nBigger ones are a bit more work, as you need something that can support them. I personally use a 3/8\" diameter allthread rod, with a  hoop bent on one end (to attach to a limb, or a nail or whatever else you use to hang it from) and an acute bend in the other end approx 45 degrees or smaller and about 5 inches long. Slide that end in it's gills and out its mouth then make the cuts and peel like above. My grandad used to nail their heads to a tree to skin...but that's not a great way....you gotta pull those nails back out.",

Unemployment after the end of socialism was pretty bad in certain areas, so some people used shit like this to catch zander, pike and catfish to sell, and feed their families.\n\nPeople usually used willow branches  that were around as thick as a thumb as the rod, 4-6 meters of line, and little fishes or fish meat as bait.\n\nBut this whole \"lets leave a hook in the water and fish will eventually hook themselves\" idea isn't anything revolutionary. We have ethnology books from the 19-20th century with illustrations and descriptions of the various techniques used by fishermen.\n\nhttp://mek.oszk.hu/03100/03104/html/mhk2a2b.htm#362\n",

The risk of the trap tripping bc a stick snagged the hook, the risk of a fish getting pulled out of the water, the risk of the rod being pulled out of the ground (and a fish dying for no reason because it was dragged by the rig). A basket trap keeps the fish alive, keeps it fresh for eating, and you can toss back little ones that aren't worth eating. You can also build a basic basket for not much more effort than this and it doesn't require more work later other than re-bait and occasionally repair. There's less time constraints on checking them because the fish is alive and in water, and will be fine until they eat the bait and eventually starve.",

This sets the hook really well and I have caught 2 catfish and a bass this way. \n\nHope that helps anyone who is interested!",

There's no force holding the line taught, which means the trigger only actuates if the fish has already swallowed the bait anyways before swimming off. Better off with just a baited hook in the water.\n\nThe 'automatic yoyo' reel is a much better alternative, since it is designed to be suspended from a branch, allowing the hook and line to be fully extended by gravity, allowing the hook set mechanism to actually work at the moment the fish takes the bait.",

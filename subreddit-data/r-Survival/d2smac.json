            "comment": "I surf, so get caught in them quite often. They are more often subtle than most would expect - you won't even notice you just went from 75 yards to 150 yards. Just all of a sudden you realize how far away from the shore you have gotten.. It's hard to see the coloration of water from the surface, especially if there is a lot of sediment in it. The most common thing I have noticed is the rippling on top of the water and waves not breaking in that area.\n\nIf you are caught in one and not used to it, swim diagonally to the shore until you are free. Use the breaststroke instead of freestyle because you can keep sight of your target. Don't panic as they will very rarely pull you under - the real danger is getting too far from shore and being too tired to swim in.\n\nWorst case scenario, get the attention of someone on shore. Once they have spotted you, use a deadman's float to conserve energy.",

The fluid dynamics of live water like this is incredibly complicated, since every tiny change produces emergent properties that are just impossible to predict. There _are_ some (very rare) currents that can pull you under, but you won't get them in open water like this. There's just not enough draw. You'd have to get them near a cliff wall or similar, where a vertical cell current can start to build up.",

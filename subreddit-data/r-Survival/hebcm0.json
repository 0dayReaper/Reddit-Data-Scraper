When I was in the military you had to learn to think of all the mishaps and errors that could go wrong and plan accordingly. You rarely actually guess what's going to go wrong, but it really helps to have thought through all of your options and resources. Now when I'm out camping I'm asking myself \"what if I can't get this fire lit?\" or \"what would I do if I didn't find water here?\" and it helps me be more prepared.",

His design principle was that if there was a wrong way to do something, eventually someone would do it that way.... so you should either make sure there isn't a wrong way to do something, or be able to catch it and correct it when they do.  Of course, a corollary is that if there is a way to misquote something, someone will, and that's how we got from Murphy's Design Principle to Murphy's Law.",

I can tell you\u2019ve screenshot this image based on the full screen image showing the top of your screen and the fact I saw this earlier today. Please if you\u2019re going to go through the effort of cross posting without acknowledging the op please do it right  and copy the image or save it to your device and repost it, it would make it look nicer, thanks! ;)",

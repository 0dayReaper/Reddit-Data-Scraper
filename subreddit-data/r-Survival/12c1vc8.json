    "postText": "Need y\u2019all\u2019s recommendations on gear. Not really quite survival but is related. I work with a search and rescue team and lately having to go through a bunch of briar. Makes the day miserable. I\u2019ve tried cowhide gloves and Kevlar glowed but they only protect the palm. Any recommendations on those. Second is a heavy duty walking stick that can be used to beat brush back. Used my expandable stick and well it\u2019s screwed as it\u2019s not meant for it. Thought about gerber gator junior but unfortunately people don\u2019t understand the concept to clear brush and I don\u2019t want anyone on the team injured as I\u2019m one of the few medical personnel. Just looking for ideas. Thanks in advance",

            "comment": "For those briars you could make yourself a pair of \u201ctin pants\u201d. You will have to YouTube that but there is such a thing and they are highly effective. For gloves I would recommend a good pair of pig skin leather work gloves. I can pick up hot coals straight out of a fire with those. For brush cutting you might want to forget that Gerber and I\u2019m a huge fan of good old Gerber knives for EDC. There\u2019s a cheaper machete that has better ratings called Tramontina. 14.5\u201d blade, 19.5\u201d overall length. If your budget allows then go straight for the Woodsmans Pal. It\u2019s about $195 but it\u2019s a beast built to last. Hope some of that might have been helpful and good luck.",

The welding gauntlets were the only leather gloves thick enough that i could grasp the canes and the thorns wouldnt pierce it.\n\nA billhook isnt as long as a machete but the hook at the end is handy to manipulate stabby things or other brush without touching it.",

I keep a tiny little cardboard rectangle in my wallet and a larger one in my backpack with clean needles and thread ans fishing line, align with fishing hooks.   \nThis way if something horrible happened and I needed to stitch a wound then I could, but I can also use it to help in binding things together if I need too. It takes up hardly any space at all. I also carry hand sanitizer and antiseptic wipes with triple antibiotic ointment too. Hand sanitizer has several uses which is nice and the ointment is useful for so many things. They take up hardly any space at all. Can really help get a fire going when it's damp.   \nI do not have any suggestions for a walking stick because I need one too. I figured I'd go with a European bo staff of some sort. They are super useful for traversing land as well as great for self defense.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019ve recently been offered a place at imperial for computing and been accepted to UIUC for CS. I\u2019m very conflicted atm and would just like some advice from you guys. I\u2019m an international student btw.\n\n- the cost equates to about the same, however imperial would be 3 years\n\n- the prestige of imperial definitely trumps UIUC but for CS I feel they are pretty equal in employers eyes would I be correct in saying this?\n\n- I wanted to ask what the job opportunities are like specifically in the tech sector / quant firms , how many people land internships in their first and second years and what type of companies usually hire imperial computing grads or interns? \n\n - I\u2019ve also heard that the social life/nightlife is quite dead at imperial. I know it is in London but would I be able to find a group people that enjoy going out and experiencing the nightlife + how easy is it to make friends here?",

            "comment": "first year Imperial Computing student here. \n\n\u2022 First year internships are difficult to get but this is true for all universities. However, quite a lot of first years get these spring internships / banking week internships at finance companies. I have heard that most second years get internships easily. \n\n\u2022 I cant lie, i was so concerned about the social\nlife at imperial, but trust me it is not dead. I am an international too, and i am having a great time here. My mates and I go clubbing every week, we frequently explore london, the societies here are super active too, there's always something going on. It does get kinda dead when exam season arrives and the courseworks are due. Maintaining a work-life balance is key.\n\nPS: Keep in mind that Imperial is way more rigorous and demanding than most US universities, even in the first year.",

You certainly won\u2019t be struggling to find a decent job (at least compared to everyone else)",

At imperial there are way many compulsory choices that you have to do, plus literally no time for research in the term time due to its workload. In the States, you can consider transferring to another university if you like after your first year.",

            "comment": "For the same cost, choose the US. UIUC is plenty prestigious here in the states, and fewer people here know Imperial than you\u2019d think. Once you\u2019re working in the industry, nobody will give two shits about the college you attended anyway. Typical CS major jobs (e.g. SWE) pay 2-3x more stateside (and lower taxes). Studying in the US gives you a way into the labor market via OPT /w STEM extension. The UK is a tiny country with stagnant salaries that\u2019s fading into irrelevance after Brexit. I would not suggest the UK if your alternative choice is the US.\n\nBtw I say this as an Imperial CS graduate who miraculously found a company that was willing to sponsor H-1B right away. If I had to pay international tuition anyway I would\u2019ve attended a US college.",

A quick Google search should answer your questions.\n\nI think the vast majority of people do the OPT -&gt; OPT STEM extension -&gt; H-1B -&gt; EB-3 -&gt; Citizenship route.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, but then neither is acquiring UK citizenship. If America doesn\u2019t work out or doesn\u2019t turn out how you fancy, the UK will welcome you with open arms. They\u2019re desperate!",

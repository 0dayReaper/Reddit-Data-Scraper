And I mean, Chem\u2019s head of admissions is also one of the guys that runs the MedChem courses, so I suppose he might appreciate some of the biochem personal statement aspects more than biochem might enjoy the pure chem aspects. Although then again he\u2019s a great guy so I imagine he probably consciously avoids that sort of bias hahaha\n\nI do wonder though - because it would be interesting if it was. I also don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever get an answer out of the department if it was!\n\nI also had a similar response time for Chem though - had my interview in november and had my offer by end of november, I think. It\u2019s been a while, and I only know I had the offer *before* early december, though - can\u2019t remember exact timings now haha\n\nNo clue about in computing. But iirc JMC and Computing are the same department, and so they might have some funny stuff about applying to both. OP should definitely email and ask!",

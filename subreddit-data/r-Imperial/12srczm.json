    "postText": "While pursuing my MSc in Finance and Accounting at ICBS, would it be possible for me to also work part-time in order to support my expenses? \n\nAlso, how many days a week on average does ICBS hold classes for? Asking so I could plan my part-time beforehand.\n\nIn case if you're someone already in the finance industry working in London, what are the chances for me to land a good part time job in the same finance space? Would it be easier to land a part time job with any sort of certification?\n\nPlease help!",

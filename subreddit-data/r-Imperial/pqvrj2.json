I loved walking down to south Ken station at Christmas time when the natural history museum was lit up. We also had our own hall events like casino night, movie night etc. The quality of the rooms is very good compared to say Beit which is a bit tired (or was when I visited them)",

Quite a few people in halls do live in London and move to halls for that reason it\u2019s just a case of what your priority is. You can save a lot of money living at home for sure. If your plan is to move home after first year you will save loads anyway. Depends if you want that first year experience you get in halls.",

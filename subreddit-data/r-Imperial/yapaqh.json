They only recently introduced the 'BSc in Economics, Finance and Data Science', which is pretty different from pure Econ courses taught at other universities. \n\nIf you want to do that, then find something that demonstrates that you're also interested in finance and data science.\n\nGenerally good extracurriculars are things like working on independent projects, attending public lectures (Imperial offer quite a few), having relevant books to talk about, and doing whatever relevant clubs / societies you might have available to you in your area / at school that you enjoy.",

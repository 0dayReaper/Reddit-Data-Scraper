    "postText": "The CBSE (Indian) high school curriculum badly messed up in conducting our annual exams this year with the changed pattern: mistakes in the question paper, out of portion questions, and short exam duration, besides taking poor decisions that let 100s of schools use unfair means to score marks (Source: 100s of schools were already caught cheating by the Board, and it was news throughout India). Consequently, this years' grades are nothing of an accurate representation of students' academic abilities.\n\nDo you think emailing the admission officers regarding this would help reduce/overlook conditional offers since this year is nothing like the previous 20 years?\n\nPOV: Missed conditional offer due to the weird pattern, as did SEVERAL others.",

            "comment": "I have send a similar email about my conditional offer, which is I'm not completely fulfilling. They told me to wait until all applicants declare their results. Imperial gave a bit higher conditions than usual, many of the applicants in similar situations. I don't think you're autorejected bcs of some of your missing conditions. However explaining your problem is also a good option, let them know what happened. Good luck !",

Your interviewer will have your PS in front of them, so be very well versed with it.\n\nMy interviewer was excellent (lmao I only got asked ONE question and follow up questions on that) \n\nPerhaps brush up on some basic programming concepts like ADT, sorting, and code optimization.  \n\nAnd no, I didn't get any math qs",

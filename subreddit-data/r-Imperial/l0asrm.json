            "comment": "Hi! Congratulations on finishing your BSc! I did the MPH at Imperial a few years back. I don\u2019t know exactly what made my application successful. I had reasonably good grades from my undergrad and I was fortunate to be able to get good references\u2014but I\u2019d guess so did most other applicants. In my case, I had done my BSc at Imperial too, so this could have boosted my chances, but this probably isn\u2019t exactly the kind of advice that might be useful for you haha. \n\nThat said, I think a strong personal statement would be a good opportunity to make your application stand out. Make a clear case for why you want to do an MPH (eg you did a BSc in Biological Sciences\u2014why an MPH after and not pursue work in industry, for example), what you hope to learn, and what you intend to do after completing it. \n\nIdk if this is very generic advice but it\u2019s what I can think of at the moment. Feel free to DM me if you want to discuss more/have specific questions. \n\nAll the best with your application!",

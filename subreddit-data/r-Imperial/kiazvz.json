    "postText": "Hello everyone!\nI was wondering if  Master students at Imperial need to do a master thesis (research practical)? \nDo you simply approach profs/group leaders? What is normally the selection criteria to be accepted? \nI have the opportunity to do my thesis in Imperial as part of an exchange program and would be grateful for each input :)) \nHappy holidays!\n\n\nEdit: I study Biomedical Engineering and I am look for something in Data Analysis in Biomedicine in general.",

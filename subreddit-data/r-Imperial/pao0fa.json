If you want to learn how to make ergonomic designs, and maybe a but of robotics, then deseng is the best fit for you. If you are expecting to do industrial engineering, manufacturing, thermodynamics etc. then deseng will not offer you the experience you are after. So if your question is just about the masters then yes, an MEng is perfectly good. If you are asking about \"engineering accreditation\" (let's call it that for now) then deseng will not be on par with the other engineering principles.",

If you want to apply engineering principles to human challenges with design thinking, then DesEng is great. There's more than 'a bit of robotics', but you'll have to focus your own education if you want to develop more than a middling knowledge of most engineering fields. You'll find a lot of other engineers salty that we don't need to spend our degree torturing ourselves with difficult maths, but becoming the best analytical engineer was never the point. \n\nThe above is misinformation, DesEng is accredited by IMechE and others and is as valid a route to chartered engineership as the mechanical engineering course.",

Des Eng teaches you a lot of surface level content about several engineering disciplines (mechanical, electrical, comp and materials) but doesn\u2019t really go in depth on one thing. If you want to do robotics, comp eng (EIE) or mech eng is far better as you learn more in-depth about everything. Yes des eng isn\u2019t as torturous as the other engineering disciplines, but the difficulty of traditional engineering is what employers want. Big investment banks hire engineers cause they work the hardest, have had to go through a lot in uni. End of the day they\u2019re all great degrees and what you enjoy doing matters more.",

Investment banks will value you less, but you\u2019ll be valued more by firms and in roles where a degree of creative thinking and interdisciplinary communication is more important than being able to crunch the numbers. Not every job is suited to the hard scientists; the entire point of deseng is that analytical engineers working with more human-focussed engineers can produce something better then either group could produce alone (in many, but not all, domains).",

It can be quite useful because typically it saves the hassle of having to reapply for things etc, and it's always good to have all your ducks in a row, colloquially speaking. Otherwise, you can always do the 3 year BEng course and Masters courses are only a year long even separately. I am on the MEng course in the 3rd year, but afaik switching between MEng to BEng is not so hard process, but BEng to MEng requires strong scores etc.",

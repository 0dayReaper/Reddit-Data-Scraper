Hi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be visiting London, England from the 22nd to the 25th of February (all expenses paid by the school).\n\nI was wondering if there is anyone who belongs to Deep Tech or Startup Communities that I could meet?  \n\n\nI'm Korean, but I'm studying abroad in Japan.",

Startups are a bit more difficult to find in the main South Kensington campus. I work in a startup in the White City campus, that is where a big incubator is. Let me know if that helps or if I can help with anything more",

I haven't heard back yet.  \nYou work on the White City campus! If you don't mind, could you give me your email address and I can explain the details from there?",

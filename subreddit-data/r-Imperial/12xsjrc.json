    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am considering applying for the MSc Computing/Advanced Computing. I am wondering what are my chances of admission with the following profile:\n\nEducation:\n\n* Top \\~5% of class\n* BSc CS degree\n* Top CS uni in the Netherlands\n\nProfessional Experience:\n\n* 1-year internship at a cloud computing consultancy\n* 3 months at a top tech internship in the UK\n\nResearch Experience:\n\n* (Potentially) a paper written for a university course, unlikely to be published in time\n\nMy main problem is that I have very good professional experience but hardly any academic experience. I am wondering if professional experience is valued the same/slightly below academic experience, or if it is hardly considered altogether.\n\nThanks!",

Don\u2019t let yourself be the person that tells you you can\u2019t get in. They definitely won\u2019t be expecting an undergrad to have published papers, so the fact that you think you might have one is a big plus. Get the associated professor to write one of your references. Good luck",

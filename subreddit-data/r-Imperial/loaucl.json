    "postText": "Can anyone who has had their interview this year or in the past please tell me what their aeronautical engineering interview was like? Pretty much what were the technical questions (if any) and I know the interview depends a lot on the interviewer but I just want to get a rough idea.",

            "comment": "Had my interview yesterday. Mine had 3 parts. \n\nThe first part was him asking me why I wanted to study at Imperial and why aeronautical engineering, the standard stuff. \n\nSecond part was him grilling me on my personal statement. Make sure you know the full details of what you wrote.\n\nThird part was a couple of questions about a plane in flight. I had to draw a free body diagram, work out some lift equation and work out a glide angle or something. Had never heard of some of those  things before but the interviewer guided me through them.\n\nAlso it's smart casual but also online this year so wear a shirt and blazer on top at least, can't hurt to let them know you're serious.",

Drawing airflow around a wing, causes of drag and such. \n\nIt varies a lot, many people got different things asked and I felt my interview wad much easier than others. Showing interest in the subject I think is more important than solving each question perfectly.",

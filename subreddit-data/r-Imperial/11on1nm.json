    "postText": "Hi, I recently received an offer for the MSBA course via email but the official letter will take some time to appear on my portal. In the meanwhile, I wanted to know what the conditions of the offer usually are, like for example I currently have a GPA of 9.7 so I was wondering how much room I have to fall back on. I already have an offer from NUS without any specific conditions on the required grades which I have to accept by tomorrow so I really wanted to get an idea regarding the conditions at Imperial ASAP.",

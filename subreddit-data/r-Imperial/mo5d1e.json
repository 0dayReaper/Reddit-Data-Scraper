            "comment": "Currently everything is online for me. Lectures tutorial and even exams are at home. I am reading physics but I know that for some other courses they are slowly moving back to in person. Some student labs have also opened again so experimental teaching is mainly in person again. \n\nAs it stands the idea is to go back to normal, I.e. what is was 2 years ago, in October. Obviously, this is still dependent on the government so if covid once again sees rising cases measures might be put back into place. This is very unlikely as the plan is for 'normal' life to resume by June.\n\nThe other alternative that may prevent in person teaching is that the college, along with some staff, do not want to return to in person learning. They prefer this style. It would also mean more money to the college is Places were not limited by space. Students, and the majority of lecturers, are against this so again it is unlikely; though it is not unheard of for the college to ignore the students is its decision making.",

Last autumn I had 12 hours of teaching on campus for the entire term. Hopefully a bit more this time??",

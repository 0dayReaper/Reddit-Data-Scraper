I would recommend being honest but provide some degree of detail (eg it is one of the best universities for my subject, ranked number whatever. I have seen this recent news article about imperial research and I found it very inspirational etc etc).",

Or discuss the department such as various schemes they may have (one thing that comes to mind are the i-explore modules, they are available to everyone across all departments).",

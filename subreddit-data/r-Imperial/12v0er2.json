They had stipulated decision dates for my course i.e. Business Analytics so everyone who applied during a specific round received their offers all together. Idk which course you have applied to but since this is the final round for international applicants they will roll out decisions pretty fast after the Kira interview as compared to other rounds. Final rounds are usually shorter in length.",

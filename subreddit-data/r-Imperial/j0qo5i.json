    "postText": "Hi, \n\nIm a year 13 student, and I'm looking at mathematics and computing, however I havent taken further mathematics. I wanted to find out if this is a major issue as on the imperial website it says fm is required however on other sites such as complete university guide doesnt have fm as a required subject, which is it? And is it possible to get in without it even if it is required?\nThank you.",

But i will not take a formal exam in it as i cannot afford to sign up to it myself. Is there any way around this requirement that you know of? Thanks",

Lots of work (obviously) but also lots of opportunities to learn some really interesting things. You don't even need to particularly like hardware, as you can pretty quickly choose the modules that you like (3 and 4th year, may no longer be the case, I assume it still is). I'm pretty sure the course was updated in recent years to have a larger focus on software.\n\nWorkload in first year is super chill, like most courses. Second year is alright, but a bit more work, with lots of practical labs. Workload ramps up _heavily_ in later years. You will spend your life on campus working \ud83d\ude09.\n\nWork prospects are great.\n\nAnything specific you wanna know?",

It's definitely hard work, but if you can get through 2nd year you'll be in the clear.\n\nThey've changed the course so now EEE and EIE have a common first year, so there definitely is a bit more software than there used to be, but it's well taught and pretty fun early on anyway. \n\nIt's fair to worry about the cost of living in London, but if you're a UK student you'll get an extra bit of maintenance loan and if you can get a paid internship over one summer you should be able to stay clear of your overdraft. \n\nOne thing I'll add is that if you're looking for a better sense of what EEE / EIE is like, I'd recommend the book \"The Information\" by James Gleick. Although it's not really 'about' EEE, it hits on a lot of topics not covered by any 'Engineering' book your school might have recommended.",

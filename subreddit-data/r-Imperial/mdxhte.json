            "comment": "I m a 2nd year EU and CS student at Imperial. I was lucky enough to join uni in 2019 so brexit doesn't affect and I have no idea how it affects EU students starting uni this year. I don't know to much about scholarships or the current EU loadn situation, but I can give you an advice about managing money. 1. If you decide to live in London without a scholarship and are tight with money you should 100% do you best to stay in a hall for as long as possible. You can become a hall senior in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th years (I am one at Xenia), make sure to talk to your hall warden and keep on eye on the Imperial accomodation website so you don't miss the deadline for applying (which is sometime in March) 2. As a CS student you can become a UTA from the 2nd year (lab helper, paid about 16 pounds per hour and you can take up to 6h per week (this number might go down if people don't show up tho), I am one and it doesn't take too much time and you can miss some sessions if you're busy). There are other opportunities as a helper, such as talking to offer holders, but they are not as often, tbe UTA job is weekly. 3. You can try to get a part time job. CS students receive mails weekly with job opportunity and if you read all of them you ll manage to find a part time job as a programmer for some startup company. This year (my 2nd year) I was a UTA and developed an app for a guy (September-now) and it is indeed very stressful and time consuming, but with a lot of hard work you can def do it. 4. An internship is a good opportunity to earn money and experience, but it s not common for 1st year students to get one (I didn't get one). In the 2nd year you can def get one if you apply to enough companies and prepare for the interviews.\n\nThis is just some advice from my own experience, sorry I cannot answer your question. Idk your financial situation so I have no idea if your family can keep you in London for a year, but if you manage to go through the first year you can def help your family by earning your own money from the 2nd year.\n\nIf you have any questions about the things that I've mentioned don't hesitate to dm me!",

Last year I had already been a UTA for a day during the summer for year-12 students, so I think I had secured my place this way, but usually Maria should email you. So you don' really apply to be a UTA, they choose you, but tbh emailing her sometime after getting the exam results to let her know that you are interested in the position will probably get her attention.",

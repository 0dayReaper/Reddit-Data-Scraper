    "postText": "Hello everybody! I was going through ICBS's MSc entry requirements page where they have mentioned that I'll have to answer few career planning questions. \n\nBut nowhere did they mention anything about the essay or the personal statement. Are these 4 career planning questions a replacement for the SOP/ Personal statement. Or I'll have to submit my personal statement separately further down the application procedure?\n\nPlease help a brother! Thanks",

            "comment": "Personal statement is separate to the career planning questions. You will have to answer 4 additional questions for the personal statement. Also note that the career planning section says 4 questions but you\u2019ll actually have to answer 7. Once you click on the third/fourth one ( I don\u2019t remember) , it\u2019ll show you the three additional questions where you\u2019ll have to list 3 criterion you\u2019re prospective employers are looking for in a candidate. Hope this helps!",

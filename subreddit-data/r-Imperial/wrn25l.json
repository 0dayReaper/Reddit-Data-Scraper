    "postText": "I am applying for mechanical engineering in icl, I meet the grades requirements perfectly but my ATAS certificate was submitted 07/07, and it\u2019s issued back on 04/08 which passed the deadline of 19/07, the late submission is due to me being an international student, and the ATAS requires referees contact details in my pervious school which I can only get once I finished my a levels and get back to my country. I emailed and called the engineering admission team and mechanical engineering department to explain the situation, but they said they have reconsidered my offer and declined it/I fail to meet the requirement of submitting the ATAS on time and the course is completely full. Is there any thing I can do to get the offer back? I really want and need the offer.",

            "comment": "if you emailed admissions after the ATAS deadline, coming from personal experience it is highly unlikely they will reconsider their stance and give you back an offer. i applied late last year (2021 entry) and subsequently got my ATAS late, my offer was declined but they guaranteed me a place for 2022 entry, given that this time i got ATAS in time.\n\ni do know someone who (i think) got their ATAS late, or if they didn\u2019t, had issues with their ATAS application, but they informed admissions way before the ATAS deadline and their place still got confirmed.\n\nboth the someone i know and i applied for mechanical engineering.",

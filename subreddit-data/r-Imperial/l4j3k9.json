            "comment": "Hey, \n\nI had to do the video submission as well (civil) and I had only 4 questions. The first 3 are generally questions about yourself or your high school, your interests outside school, etc and the 4th one would be a technical question related to your course.  They say it takes about 30 minutes, but the whole thing only took around 15 for me. They usually give you about 15 seconds to prepare your thoughts before answering each question. You can't speak for over 2 minutes for the first 3 questions, and over 3 minutes for the last question. \n\nHope it helps.",

Let me know if you need any help/want to know something about the degree/Imperial life.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be to cope with both A-levels/IB plus all of the applications during the pandemic.\n\nBest of luck to you both and hope you make it in!",

(Or future one in your case haha)\n\nLast year I heard back within two weeks, I think (lots has happened since then \ud83d\ude02) but the situation is very different right now.\n\nThat information has probably been on their website since before the pandemic, so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it\u2019s taking longer right now!\n\nI believe the staff are only in their offices for half the normal time currently (they have a \u2018cohort\u2019 model from my understanding - where a few groups swap in and out of the office to reduce crowding), so there might be fewer people reviewing applications at any one time! \n\nGood luck though, I hope you get your offer!",

    "postText": "Hey guys i\u2019m an upcoming postgrad here for Sep 2023, and i\u2019m looking at where to live. I know they have no halls for postgrad and private student accom is kinda scam, so does anyone have suggestions for good areas to live? I\u2019m probably gonna rent with a 1-2 of my current flatmates so i\u2019m looking at flats/apartments.\n\nMy friend suggested shepherd\u2019s bush which seems decent but a bit expensive. I have some budget so around 250 per week is fine if that helps.",

            "comment": "Honestly, *everywhere* is expensive in reasonable commuting range to Imperial.\n\nDo you know what campus you\u2019re going to be at? That\u2019ll have a fairly big impact. If you\u2019re at white city you can stay a bit further out on the central line, and either get a nicer place or save some money, whereas if you\u2019re at south ken or charing cross you\u2019re a bit more limited.\n\nShepherd\u2019s bush is pretty good for white city, not the *best* for south ken, and pretty decent for charing cross. For south ken it\u2019s not too bad, but there will be a tube change involved (or you could cycle, if you wanted). \n\nHammersmith, west kensington, fulham, and those sorts of areas are pretty popular for south ken, as well as some areas the other side of hyde park like Paddington or queensway, but they tend to be a bit pricier/shittier for the price.\n\nBut realistically, the best way to get something right now is to physically turn up to an estate agent, explain what you\u2019re looking for, and ask if they\u2019ve got anything they\u2019ve not publicly posted yet you could go and visit *now*. They\u2019ll probably have some stuff you can look at, and that\u2019s what a lot of people I know have had to do to get somewhere that wasn\u2019t a shithole. Much harder to do if you\u2019re not already staying nearby, though!",

At least, decent quality flats in not shit areas that are not ridiculously expensive, if you get what I mean.\n\nFlats that meet even just most of that criteria will often be off the market within a day, or at best a few days to a week, so yeaaah, it\u2019s a fucking pain right now haha",

Learned this the hard way. You can live in hammersmith/fulham/earl's court/battersea for under 250pw flat share. Imperial has its own website where flats are advertised to students - imperial home solutions, apart from that go on rightmove and zoopla, circle your area of interest and start regularly checking for places within your budget. A lot of stuff is becoming available now as students begin to move out so I'd suggest to start looking immediately.\n\nAlso, please don't do the \"it's further away, but it's cheaper\" thing before actually calculating travel costs to campus. I would personally much rather live somewhere 30min walk to campus for 200\u00a3 instead of somewhere further away for 170\u00a3 where I have to be in the tube for 30min and also pay at least 30\u00a3 for the commute. That depends on your commute preferences of course, but I'm just saying because I see a lot of people going down this path of reasoning, which is impractical at best.",

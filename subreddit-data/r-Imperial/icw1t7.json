            "comment": "I highly recommend taking a language over the other modules. There is no better way to learn it than in a classroom setting with a qualified teacher. It\u2019s free (books aren\u2019t though!) and you can always quit if it gets too busy or difficult. If you\u2019re committed, they are pretty serious with attendance, tests, orals, homework, exams, coursework etc. but it all helps to improve your ability. Most departments offer the option for a Horizons language as one of your electives in later years, though usually at level 2 or higher. It also never clashes with anyone\u2019s schedule as all departments are told to leave 2 hours open every week for it. The cherry on top is that it shows up on your transcript as extra credit if not taken as part of your course, which isn\u2019t that useful but it\u2019s a recognition of your work. I took Japanese Levels 1-3 and have thoroughly enjoyed it even though at times it\u2019s been pretty challenging.",

            "comment": "The history of science and empire course was really interesting to me. As was the philosophy course. But there isn't a bad course on the list.\n\nThe most generally employable is probably the languages, or one of the making and prototyping ones. But ultimately it depends on what you want to do? If you're interested in journalism, maybe the communicating science (year 2) one is better? Or maybe you want to do some sci-fi? Then creative writing is for you. There is no 1 best choice really.\n\n\nAlso horizons are superbly chilled for the most part. Cause they don't count towards your grade if you fail them by say not doing the final assessment. And a pass with merit is a fairly easy thing to achieve with them. Prototyping/biohacking/hackspace ones and languages tend to be a little bit more involved, but still chill enough.",

            "comment": "I would highly recommend Philosophy. First of all, there is no hard cap on the number of students that can attend, so if you apply to it as your first option, you will most likely be able to participate. The module was really well taught, with every lecture hosting a very engaging debate between students and the professor, who is really good at his job. Furthermore, there are practically NO requirements for self study or homework between sessions(except at the very end), so this will by no means burden your other academics. \nThe content of the course essentially covers a brief overview of the major areas of philosophy and only lasts for the first ( or second) semester.",

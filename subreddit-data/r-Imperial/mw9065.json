            "comment": "Yes it does. I graduated undergrad a decade ago so I'm sure things have changed somewhat.  There was fine chem stream if you wanted to go into pharma, nuclear steam as well. Plenty of different courses to choose in later years, although petrochem was the biggest focus then.  I think there is probably now an even greater focus on green chem, although they have always been quite good for that. They have a lot of industrial contacts so it is a good place to find out about industry generally, although the course may still be overly theoretical.",

Still a lot of options in more theoretical stuff (optimisation and modelling mostly) but you can definitely find whatever is most helpful for your industry of choice",

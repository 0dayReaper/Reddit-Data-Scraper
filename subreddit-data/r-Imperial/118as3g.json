    "postText": "Hello redditors, \n\nI am looking to apply for the MSc in Financial Technology, and had a few questions for anyone who currently is enrolled or has studied this degree. The requirements mention optional GMAT/GRE, but is it implied that you have these scores, or your chances are lower? I haven't given either, and have been looking to apply, so I want to be sure whether the lack of this test score would hinder my chances by any margin.",

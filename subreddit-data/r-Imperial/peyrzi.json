Will it be right before classes start? \n\nAlso, are professors okay with students missing class occasionally? Or is attendance mandatory/does it depend on the professor? \n\nThanks!",

I just mean for long periods of time absence, you may have some visa implications, but I guess saying try to attend your classes is a given, don't take the first year for granted)\n\n(From a domestic student who skipped almost half of his first year)",

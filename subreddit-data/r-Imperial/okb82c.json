(DM me let's chat I guess)\n\nI joined and looked at the Facebook group they have - Imperial College London Flatshares &amp; Student housing though it seems to be filled w potential scams??? Maybe I'm being a little too untrusting but really any advice on this front is greatly appreciated. If there's other avenues to meet people as well, I'd greatly appreciate if you could let me know.\n\nI'm looking to live within a 30 min walk of the South Kensington campus, so any suggestions or at least price estimates on what I should be paying to not get scammed?",

Spare Room is supposedly helpful, or you can contact a letting agency and they can try and find you a flatshare with other students/young adults - a few of my friends has success with this.",

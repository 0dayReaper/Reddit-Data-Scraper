    "postText": "Hi all :) \n\nI'm on a deferred entry gap year currently and will be starting my degree in Mechanical Engineering this October. Incredibly excited but there's one thing I keep asking and it's to do with workload/intensity. I'm aware that Imperial is intense for all their degrees but just wanted to ask actual students about their own experiences. I'd really like to participate in sports (Amateur boxing and football, but not a priority as such just wanting to try football out again) and try to start a youtube channel for something I'm passionate about. The youtube channel would take about 10-15 hours a week if that helps put things into perspective.\n\nI worry it'll either be the above or a decent degree from Imperial. Have people personally found they can manage a work-life balance so long as they are able to prioritise studying closer to exam terms etc? Or is it the case of \"you're done from the second you enter xD, no social life xD\" like the intellectuals over at thestudentroom seem to suggest about Imperial? (I highly doubt it's this bad of course, but you get what I mean)\n\nJust wondering if it's manageable to keep some hobbies going alongside studying. I'm willing to make sacrifices to ensure I get a good degree here, even if it means waving bye to some hobbies but it'd be kinda cool to keep them going lol. \n\nAnyways thank you so much for taking your time to read this if you got this far, hopefully, I didn't come across as rude or anything. I kinda suck with writing what's in my mind and have been wanting to post this for a month now so most of this was typed as I was speaking to myself.\n\nAny replies would be greatly appreciated :)",

            "comment": "Hey, not Mech Eng but did a Master's in Maths at Imperial a few years ago. I basically didn't work very much in 1st year and did OK, tried the same in 2nd year and did badly, got my act together for 3rd year and then 4th year I really did it well - good studies, free time, hobbies, got fit, great social life etc etc.\n\nI was given a piece of advice at the start (which I didn't follow until 3rd year and wish I did) - treat uni work like a 9-5 job. Try and get up at the same time every day and get yourself in - people used to think it was some sort of magic that I'd have already done work before an 11am lecture. If you get used to doing that weekdays I found I was fairly free outside of it. \n\nWednesday afternoons were free time anyway, so usually that's when sports matches happen. Training might be on a weekday evening, but usually after 6pm as that's the latest lectures finish.\n\nThe other good thing I learned in third year from a flatmate was to still get up on Saturday and Sunday, not quite as early but usually by 8am and do some work then. Nothing interesting is usually happening at that time so you're not missing out. We had another flatmate who was always amazed that we'd be playing playstation at 12pm when he got up and join us, yet we were on top of work as we'd done some in the morning.\n\nMy only other top tip is be friendly on your course! The lecturers all knew we worked together on problem sheets so make them really hard, so you almost had to work together. Having a circle of friends on your course makes keeping going so much easier.\n\nTL;DR - uni work Mon - Fri 9-5, Weds afternoon off, couple of hours on Sat and/or Sunday morning sorted me out for everything, every other minute of the week is all yours... enjoy\n\nstill TL;DR - get up in the fucking mornings!",

I never really thought of education in that sense but that's all it is, I guess it's just stay consistent with your work so you don't have an overwhelming amount of work to catch up on right?\n\nHaving friends seems useful, not just for problem sheets but to actually enjoy uni haha. Will note that too. Thanks a lot for your response :)",

Everything can be balanced fairly easily (imo) if you actually do work throughout the year but jts very easy to just get lost in uni experience and have fun for a year then be screwed at exam time (from experience).",

                    "comment": "Gotcha, it seems tempting to skip early morning lectures but sounds like it pays off. At the very least gives you a routine to follow so I'll ensure to up my discipline skill for the next few months lol, cheers for your response :) Just wanted to ask you, how have you personally found the course? Is it taught well or is it a mix of bad and good where you're mostly left to your own to figure things out etc. I've heard some nightmare stories from other friends at university right now about badly taught courses; was wondering if Imperial is any different for Mech Eng",

            "comment": "The only thing that seems unreasonable is wanting to do football again. I love football but the imperial pitches are close to an hour away from campus, that's a lot of time that you could be working instead. Otherwise everything you've said is fine, it depends on the rate you do work of course. Plus workload comes in waves, one month you might be relaxed-ish and the other you are plastered with deadlines and tutorial sheets.",

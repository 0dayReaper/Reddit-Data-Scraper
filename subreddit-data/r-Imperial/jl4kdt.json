    "postText": "I recently graduated with a 1st in an EEE BEng from the University of Bristol. Despite obtaining a first, my average in my first year was pretty bad (since it didn't count towards my degree classification I was more lax than I should've been). Also, I had some personal health problems that meant I had to take a year out between 2nd and 3rd year. With that being said I also got a very strong score on my Bachelors thesis (which pertains to ML) &amp; I'm converting it into a research paper (in my own time) for submission to a journal in early 2021.\n\nHow likely is it that i'll get admitted into the MSc in CS (SWE or ML/AI) at Imperial? I'm going to try regardless, but I feel as though I have almost no chance at being admitted. Does anyone have any advice/ anything to contribute? Thanks in advance.",

What I say is very general.\n\nA first from a Russell Group university and a strong project score puts you in good stead. Shame about first year but people know that first year is a little sketchy for lots of people so I wouldn't worry about it. Time out for health reasons is perfectly acceptable so long as it's explained and justified. \n\nSeeing as the first paragraph on the imperial webpage for the MSc CS is \"The MSc in Computing Science is a taught postgraduate course aimed at excellent students who may not have studied computing so far but who are keen to acquire core computing skills or deepen their existing knowledge of computing.\" And that sounds like it pertains very much to you, I would hazard that the chances of you being excepted were pretty good overall. \n\nAt the end of the day though, the only way to absolutely guarantee that you won't get on is to not apply. Apply and see what happens! I think you're in with an excellent shot.",

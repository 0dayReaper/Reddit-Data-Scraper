    "postText": "Hi everyone! I have a conditional offer for my postgraduate studies in ICL. Recently, I took my IELTS exam and got the scores today. The requirement set by ICL is 7.0 overall (min 6.5 in each section). I achieved an overall score of 7.5 but scored 6.0 for writing. I have submitted the report form to ICL.\n\nDo you guys think they will be lenient and consider I have passed? or will they ask me to retake the exam again? I understand there is a pre-session course for English as well. \n\nHas anyone faced the same situation before? Please do help out a fellow student. Thank you.",

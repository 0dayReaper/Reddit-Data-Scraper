My main concern is that I would have around 5 years of work experience by then.\nWould that impact my chances of getting accepted? Any specific courses I should avoid or target? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Sorry can you clarify what F\u201922 means? I\u2019m studying Finance at the business school right now. Most students in the UK do their masters straight after undergrad but there are also a lot of older students. I have classmates in their 30s. Some course have more experienced student and some have more straight out of undergrad students so try to look at the statistics on the class profile. When I did my application I was 23 years old and had about 3 years of working experience. I think I explained how getting a masters will help me in my career pretty well in my personal statement. I think if you can explain why you want to do that specific program in context with your work experience it should not matter that you have more experience.",

Those were exactly my thoughts until I realised LBS doesn\u2019t accept applicants with more than 2 years experience; that made me wonder if years of experience is potentially a factor. I also read for some of the courses ( can\u2019t remember which ) that applicants over 2 years of experience will be considered on case to case basis.\nI have about 3.5 years of engineering experience now and by the time I intend to join ( fall 2022 ), I would have around 5 years.",

Also internship experience don\u2019t count, work experience only gets counted after you get your undergrad degree. Anyways, the \u201cinternational\u201d type courses typically have the older students.",

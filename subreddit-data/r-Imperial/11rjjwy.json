    "postText": "Hi guys, I have a bachelor in civil engineering and ~2yrs of work experience in transportation planning consulting. I\u2019m interested in MSc transport offered by imperial college London and was wondering if there will be an admission interview (because some ppl got interviewed and others didn\u2019t, so i guess candidates are randomly selected for interview?). If yes, what kind of questions will be asked? Any technical/math questions? Thanks!",

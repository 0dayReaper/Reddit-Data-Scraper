    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI am a prospective student that hopes to join Imperial to do a master's degree in the coming few years. \n\nAs the title states, I was wondering what the difference and perhaps the benefits of doing Computer Science or EIE are at Imperial. Are there any long term benefits, perhaps after uni? \n\nI personally am more of a hardware person and like to know how things work, but do also enjoy the software side of things, but am not sure which may be the right degree to go towards. To my understanding, there are modules in each degree that allow you to specialize a bit in the other degree that may make up for the lack of computing/engineering. I have also been able to attend the EE/EIE open day on Tuesday, and did enjoy listening to it.\n\nIf anyone does either, I would love to hear your experience doing it so far. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hey there. I\u2019m a 2nd year EIE at imperial. Firstly, EIE is in no means less \u2018prestigious\u2019 than computing. Employers really don\u2019t care that one has a lower acceptance rate than the other. Furthermore, in all my peers\u2019 LinkedIn profiles EIE is written as EECS (electrical engineering and computer science) instead as they\u2019re equivalent. Long term, there\u2019s simply more benefits to EIE over straight up CS. Firstly, CS has a very low barrier to entry, meaning without significant money almost anyone can pick up an online CS course or boot camp and become a capable programmer. This means that the CS field is becoming increasingly more saturated. Furthermore, countries such as India and China which are heavily into IT are being used to outsource tech work in major companies. For instance, IBM since 2017 has had more SWE employees in India than the US. With covid showing the benefits of working from home, companies now realize that outsourcing and having employees is different, cheaper countries can still be beneficial and produce same quality of work. However, EIE also contains EE which is required a very high barrier to entry. A well trained EE usually has to have a college degree as compared to a programmer. This makes EE less saturated and also increases demand. Furthermore, we\u2019re seeing a revolution in computer hardware technologies, making EIE a very future proof course. Finally, EIE is roughly 50% EE and 50% CS in first year and is 20-30% EE and 70-80% CS in the next 3 years. Also most computing students are expected to self study programming languages like Python as imperial mainly teaches in Haskell and Kotlin, therefore this is also expected and achievable by EIE students. Finally, I\u2019ve had friends from EIE attain internships at Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Palantir, Jane street and Citadel. The jobs attainable by a CS and EIE (or EECS) student are exactly the same.",

                    "comment": "Wow. Thank you so much for the insight, and this has greatly reduced my stress. My concern was initially if I would have an somewhat equal chance at work with a big tech company (most of which you already stated and have addressed) and if by doing EIE, whether I would miss out on much CS, and from what I understand, it most likely won't be much. I have also started to learn python this summer holiday, which may help. \n\nOne small question, I remember at the Imperial Online Open day, the EIE course was described as being either a Bachelor's, or a Master's (a year abroad however), however the Imperial website states that there is also a generic EIE master's course. Would it be possible if you can clarify which is the correct?\n\nThank you so much again, this was incredibly useful and I do wish you well on your course!",

                            "comment": "Yeah let me just reiterate that in EIE you can pick a lot of the modules offered by computing. Also, big tech companies make applicants do tests before giving them internships. It\u2019s performance in these tests that determine whether you get an internship or not, as opposed of the actual degree name. \n\nI\u2019m currently enrolled in the MEng EIE course without the year abroad option, so it definitely exists. Feel free to message me anytime if you need any more info. Also you can search on Google \u2018imperial EIE modules\u2019 you\u2019ll find a website that shows all the modules you can pick and the syllabus of each module. You can do the same for computing as well. Anyways take care and good luck!",

Additionally, these days the highest earning jobs right out of uni are in software, hardware and tech so don\u2019t worry bout the wages involved. Especially being in London, banks will pay a pretty penny to scoop FPGA engineers or software engineers up.",

I don't think EIE is a less valuable degree it's just different, it seems to be a lot more hardware based, have a proper read though both the course course itineraries and see what you like the look of more .",

Even though EIE makes you a more versatile applicant. Also whilst EIE has a lot of hardware involved, almost all modules in 3rd and 4th year can be taken from the computing department making it very software based as well. Also our 2nd year consists of lots of software design projects as well and other aspects like OOP, complexity, concurrency and algorithms are seen in 1st year.",

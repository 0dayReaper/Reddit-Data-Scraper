    "postText": "Just got an email from Imperial College Business School asking me to send in a video for scholarship consideration for my application to the MSc. Finance sep 2022 cohort. Is this an encouraging sign that my application has progressed a considerable degree or is it standard operating procedure?\n\nEDIT: I applied about 4 weeks ago, and I have already received an email stating that I have passed the initial requirements and my application has been forwarded to the department for review. I\u2019m an international student.",

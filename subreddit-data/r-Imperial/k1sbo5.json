    "postText": "I'm from the USA and I am really, really into Imperial.  Thankfully, my family has the financial means to support the idea, but they aren't fully on board because they don't know the process goes.  I understand the UCAS, personal statement, etc.  However, I have one big issue, particularly as a USA applicant.  I am a junior in AP Calc AB and set to take BC next year.  My concern is that I would have to get a 5 in BC my senior year and I wouldn't find out until July.  On top of that, committing to USA universities is earlier, in May.  I would need a \"backup plan\" for school in the USA in case I don't get a 5 on my AP exam, and I have no idea how that would work.\n\nI also have a few other questions that pertain to American students at ICL, so if you are one or know of any I would appreciate any help :)!",

This can be a bit expensive but hopefully you can get somewhere &lt;$500. My safety kept asking for full tuition payment, so something you can do is you can (I assume this works for the deposit too) is I kept emailing them saying their credit card system wasn't working / my card wasn't working and I took really long times to reply so that by the time they started to get pissed I just said \"sry I'm going elsewhere.\" It's quite deceptive but it works\n\nAsk me anything else you need!\n\nQuick edit for context about the credit card payment not working: I'm not saying find somewhere with bad credit card systems I'm saying that you can lie to try to postpone payment until after AP exams",

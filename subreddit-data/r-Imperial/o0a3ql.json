This year for Google STEP program multiple eie/eee students made it to the swe internship so there really isn\u2019t a Computing hard requirement\n\nLowkey would recommend to start with your engineering degree first (not sure which but most of them ain\u2019t bad for technically roles) and try and prep for swe/pm tech interviews, try out some spring weeks and insight events from technical companies, if you feel you don\u2019t learn enough cs theory still, then make the switch. This would probably work the best",

            "comment": "Ehhh, it depends on your priorities and budget.\n\nI\u2019m in Kemp Porter myself, and trust me it\u2019s been bloody perfect this year! I\u2019ve only been in to campus half a dozen times, and the accommodation out here is newer and nicer, imo anyway! And also, far cheaper!\n\nIn a normal year though, it\u2019s a bit less clear cut.\n\nThe main thing here is, you have to get up an hour earlier than you will at south ken. No two ways about it, the commute\u2019s a bit less than an hour, but leaving some room for delays and whatnot... you\u2019re getting up an hour early.\n\nSo if you like getting up early, then that\u2019s not that bad. If you\u2019re like me and hate mornings, then that kinda sucks! Haha\n\nBut, the travel costs to south ken are the same monthly, as it is the difference in weekly rent, just about. As in, the difference between what I\u2019m paying and what you\u2019d pay in south ken per week, covers travel for a month going to and from campus. So you\u2019re saving like... \u00a3200 a month, maybe a bit more, living in KP/WW, including travel?\n\nDisadvantage is I suppose the social side, but I would assume that in a normal year where places are open, there are more than enough people out in North Acton to have no problems finding people to go out with and whatnot - the Union is just a bit less accessible.\n\nFor me, I quite like the location out here, stuff\u2019s all a touch cheaper, good transport connections still, really nice building, and good access to a lot of the places I\u2019d want to be in a normal year (but they\u2019re all bloody shut). But, I also totally get why people want to stay in south ken, because by god it would be convenient!",

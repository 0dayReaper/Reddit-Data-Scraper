The new logo is a great way to make a thesis look like a hospital pamphlet... and don't get me started on the 100gsm degree certificates. \n\nIt's all very well being 'woke', but it's been clear for some time Imperial couldn't give a fuck about their students, especially those from working class backgrounds.",

I wonder if we'll get to choose a new one?",

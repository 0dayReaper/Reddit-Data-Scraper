            "comment": "Depends a lot on your budget. The South Kensignton halls are expensive, at least for the average student who isn't funded by their parents/family. If you can afford it though, it's very nice, you'll be a short walk from the lecture theatre and don't have to waste so much time commuting. South Ken is a very pretty area, the downside is that there are not that many grocery shops nearby, and a lot of the shops and cafes around tend to be expensive as it's quite a \"posh\" area.\n\nIf you don't want to spend quite as much money on accommodation, the North Acton halls are quite nice and modern. You also have small shops like Tescos and Sainsburys, and a gym right next to them. The tube station also very close. Woodward and probably Kemp Porter as well has quite a big common room and also some outdoor space, so they used to organise big events like parties and summer barbecues for the students there.\n\nWherever you end up, I think you'll have a decent time. Most of the halls organise regular events for freshers to socialize and get to know each other.",

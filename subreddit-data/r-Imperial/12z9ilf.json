Not break it.\n\nMy advice is to think about what you wrote in your application and be sure to re-iterate your main points, your motivations and your ambitions. Just be yourself and you'll be fine.\n\nFun fact - I was also nervous but I completely (i think) blacked out during my interview because of a lot of stuff on my plate back then. I don't remember a single question and my answers to it.\nBut the answers i gave is what i believed in and wrote in my applications.\nI got an offer in the end so :)\nBe yourself, you'll be just fine.",

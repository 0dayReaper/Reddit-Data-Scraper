    "postText": "I got an unconditional offer from Imperial College London\u00a0for Electrical and Electronic Engineering (MEng) which is equivalent to a 3 year bachelor's degree + a 1 year masters degree. Luckily, I found a full scholarship for the Imperial masters degree but I couldn't find any for undergraduate. I am an International student and I can barely afford to pay \u00a35,000 per year let alone \u00a360,000\n\nI like the university a lot but I don't know what to do. Is it hopeless for me? Should I just give up on trying to find a way to fund my education at Imperial? My country doesn't give any loans.",

Even the US is better for that. Your best hope of attending is to do undergraduate somewhere else and hope you can get the scholarship for the MSc.",

No bank will take that risk on a non-salaried student unless you have significant owned property to secure the debt on.\n\nI don\u2019t think you have a lot of options here. Uk universities use international students like cash cows as their fees aren\u2019t regulated in the same way that uk students are. Basically they can charge what they want and do. Imperial is a very good university but you can get a similar quality of education somewhere a lot cheaper. I would get your undergraduate elsewhere and focus on getting an excellent grade that you can use to support an MSc application.",

It is too big a risk in my opinion. Also according to some sites I have read the avg salary for an imperial graduate is \u00a340k. If you work in London with that kind of salary you will not save much money. My advise would be to do some research into the avg salary of the UK with your degree and the chances of securing a job.

I doubt it but I could be wrong.\nFor international students, I believe getting a degree in the UK will probably help people to succeed more back i their home country. There are lots of students who come for places like China and India. However people in India tend to go to the US for better job opportunities. I guess do your research for job opportunities in both countries to get an idea.",

Even graduating from imperial, you wouldn\u2019t be making nearly enough to pay that in a long time. Best course is to get experience somewhere else, make money (you\u2019ll probably find ways to have a decent career since you\u2019re competent enough to make it to imperial), and if you want you can come back for a postgrad that could help you climb a bit higher in your field.",

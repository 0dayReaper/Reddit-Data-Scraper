    "postText": "Hi! I applied to Imperial College for MEng Biomedical Engineering and last night I was invited for a virtual interview which is next week. I\u2019m stressing out right now because it\u2019s so soon and I don\u2019t know where to start. What should I expect? What should I do to prepare? What are the chances of me getting in even if I screw it up?",

No question on group work, but they did ask about my PS a bit, nothing crazy though.\n\nI'm very lucky that I'm good at just having a conversation with the interviewer, that'll take you a LONG way. Worry less about your specific knowledge and more about how you convey your interest. They're not looking for you to know it all already, but that are looking for you to have an interest and sharp mind.",

            "comment": "Had my interview before Christmas. There are two important sections a group task which has two parts for around 50 mins and around a 20 min 1 on 1 interview. The group task just don\u2019t be like one of the guys there who said nothing the entire time, make sure u up to scratch on bio/chem and some major medical devices. One task we were given some joints and we had to determine their shape, and why it would be this way, then think of materials it could be made of. Then we had to interpret some graphs of biological processes and determine how a bioengineer could alter them. The personal interview, I had mine with two people, one focused on my personal statement, the other asked me some maths/biology questions. Pretty standard question drawing differentials etc. Hope this helps",

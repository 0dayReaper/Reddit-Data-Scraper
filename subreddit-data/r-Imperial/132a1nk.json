    "postText": "Hi good people of Imperial! Can somebody help me decide if I should apply to MSc Finance or MSc Finance and Accounting to ICBS for September 2024?\n\nI am ACCA qualified with much experience in FP&amp;A and Audit. Will the admissions committee consider my profile if I choose my first preference course as MSc Finance? \n\nAlso, what if I choose MSc Finance as my first preference course and second preference course for MSc Finance and Accounting, and if I get rejected for MSc Finance, would I automatically be considered for MSc Finance and Accounting on par with someone who's chosen the latter as their first preference course?\n\nPlease help!",

I think your professional qualification definitely helps, and yes, if you choose F&amp;A as your second choice you will be considered if rejected by your first choice.",

Most people do a finance related degree first which gives them exemptions from some of the lower units of ACCA/CIMA and then they go on to study for their qualification whilst working. The full accounting qualification is seen as harder than a degree. Are you changing careers?",

During my 2nd year of undergrad, I joined ACCA to complete about 7 papers till the time I graduated. My plans changed and then I started CA (my country's CA course) but then thought of finishing off ACCA once and for all. And hence I didn't take a single exemption.",

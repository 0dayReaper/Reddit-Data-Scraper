I've heard a fair bit about the course rigor and \"lack of guidance\". How has your experience been? Thank you!  \n\n\nEdit: I'd also like to know about undergraduate research.",

            "comment": "I did it about 10 years ago. It is really intense, you will learn a great depth and diversity of physics and agonise over all nighters getting coursework done. But afterwards, comparing to graduates of other courses, the experience does potentially set you apart from others. If you're unable to keep up, which may just be how it turned out for you, then it can probably be brutal.\n\nI would say mental health was at risk back then based on Imperial's sometimes unpleasant social culture, but a decade has passed since then. The course has moved to a new head of undergrad studies who had turned the course in its head and I suspect it is a lot better as a result. Hopefully the same goes for the general college culture.\n\nThinking more about it now, I remember thinking a lot of the lecturers seemed to not care much about their undergraduate duties and just wanted to get back to their research work. I even heard this said by other lecturers. This may have changed with the new course structure, but it can be a bit disappointing that you go on a fortune of a course thinking you were so lucky to get in to, only for not many staff to care and just read their lecture notes when they have to. Something, something, not being paid enough, something, pensions.",

Some people just sort of expect lecturers to do their studying for them and will complain regardless of the quality of their instruction.\n\nImperial has a high standard, but if you get in, then you\u2019re considered capable of that. You\u2019re not going to \u2018buy a degree\u2019 here, you really have to earn it.",

That said, the workload is reduced compared to about 5 years ago, there's 1 fewer option done in years 3 and 4, and 2nd year is less stacked.\n\nIf you want to do research as an undergraduate, you email some staff and ask if they're willing to run a UROP. Generally these are not advertised much to students, you have to seek out staff.",

            "comment": "Overall I would argue that the US is ahead of the UK.\n\nFor reasons such as:\n\n* Great startup culture - how many students in an Oxbridge or Imperial cohort have a similar flair for entrepreneurship as you would in a place like Stanford? Almost none, simply because such an environment does not exist in UK universities (yet) and on average in the UK itself. The UK is a lot more conservative than the US..\n* Excellent alumni network (even if you attend Oxbridge, it is unlikely that you will experience as good as an alumni network as you would if you were to even attend a school such as UMichigan).\n* Research is on a similar level at both the US and and UK. Though the US is arguably still better. Have a look at CSRankings [\\[1\\]](http://csrankings.org/)\n* The rate at which new tech is adopted within the community is faster in the US especially in cities such as San Francisco. So this makes it a great environment to be in as a computing student.",

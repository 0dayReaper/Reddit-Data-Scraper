    "postText": "I am currently a year 12 student doing a levels. I began with further maths but soon dropped it because I had less time for other subjects. I do maths physics and philosophy right now (my school only allows further maths as a fourth a level). How are my chances of getting into imperial for aerospace engineering? Does anyone know roughly the percentage of people who take further maths who are accepted?",

Doesn't mean it'll be a no, as everything will be considered holistically. \n\nConsider if you could do an AS in further maths instead \u2013 this would definitely help your application and your overall maths ability as you will be introduced to concepts not covered in A Level maths.",

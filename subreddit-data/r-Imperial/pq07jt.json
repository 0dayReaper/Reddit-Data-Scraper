    "postText": "as a student living in london, i was thinking of getting the 18+ oyster card for travelling on all transportations (tube, train, bus, etc). I want to get a monthly travel card. I also have a trainline railcard which i\u2019ve heard can be applied to the oyster card. Would that apply to the monthly travel card? so would i get the monthly card for 1/3 discount? What\u2019s the cheapest thing to do (besides taking just buses) because the 18+ oyster card costs \u00a320 but is it worth it? need advice!",

(Same goes for your Imperial ID Card)",

            "comment": "18+ oyster indeed costs 20 quid but after that you get some discounts here and there, mostly for travelcards. After that if you plan to travel outside of London then a Railcard is highly recommended. I don't really remember how those two interact, unfortunately. For the absolute cheapest experience, you can get a monthly bus only travelcard for 60 quids or so, for a cheaper commute.",

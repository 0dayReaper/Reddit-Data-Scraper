I will definitely accept if I get off the waitlist in any of the top 3 of the schools. This year CS admissions have been unpredictable.\n\nIn UK:shortlisted and interviewed at Oxford. But, no cigar. Other UK options are JMC at Imperial and Math+Computing at Edinburgh. Imperial conditional acceptance but Edinburgh unconditional. Looks like Imperial JMC is conditional for everyone and conditions are pretty demanding. Also, Read online that Imperial JMC (Joint Math+Computing) is tough load. I don't mind studying hard but I want to live life too...\n\nHad bunch of good admissions but narrowed the other admissions to the top ranked U of California. I need to commit to some school on May 1. Did not want to be too specific. Don't want to be doxxed.\n\nReally torn right now.  Give me a brutally honest view of Imperial and UK.",

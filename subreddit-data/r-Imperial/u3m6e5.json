Most of my friends now are from my halls and I\u2019ve met more people outside from them.\n\nI know people who live in their own accommodation and I have to introduce them to people just because they find it hard to make friends. Though I guess it really depends, it\u2019s also possible to make friends through societies and group projects.",

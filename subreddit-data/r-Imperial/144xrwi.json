Can\u2019t remember for sure) which was like a 3 hour timeframe on a certain day \n\nI don\u2019t think I was able to book move-in days until later in the year, but they\u2019ll probably email you when you can",

Don\u2019t quote me on it.\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of thing they\u2019ll double confirm with you after your offer and accommodation place is all confirmed though, in august.",

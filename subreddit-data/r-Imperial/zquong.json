    "postText": "I've just been offered to study for a doctorate course at Imperial but it starts next month lol.. I really wanted postgraduate accommodation close to white city campus but looks like they're all taken up, even the private accommodation RIP.\n\nIdk London and I'm really nervous about going to this big place. Does anyone know where I can find cheap accommodation for January 2023 that's available or has anyone stayed in a place near white city campus they can recommend? Budget is below \u00a3300 pw if that helps",

            "comment": "The postgraduate accommodation isn\u2019t that good as it isn\u2019t part of Imperial and it\u2019s quite pricey for what they offer. Imo the only good part is that it can help in meeting people. Not sure if it\u2019s still the case, but it was quite easy to find a current resident who wanted to leave and you negociate with them to take over their lease (this happened by word of mouth or checking ads in campus or on facebook, be careful though). \n\nPersonally, as a PhD student I used to live in private accommodation, my first year was a bit of a gamble with random flatmates (all from imperial, which I met on facebook as we were all looking for a flat). In the following years I already had friends to look for flats together and that was fun. \n\nLess than &lt;300 pcw is quite a decent budget, way more than I had, you may be able to afford a studio near white city campus if you prefer to live alone. Check out Spare Room and Right Move to get an idea if what\u2019s available. If you need a place to stay for a couple of weeks until you find something AirBnB is a good solution.\n\nMy advise is for a start to get something temporary (maximum a year contract, preferable 6 months) so you can get to know the city and you start making friends, to make a better choice for the next years. For the latter check out any postgraduate activities and societies, try to find a facebook/instagram/whatsapp group for pgs (in my time facebook was popular but no idea what people use nowadays for this. Your timing isn\u2019t great in the sense that most pgs students start in October and there are lots of events to meet people, so it will be a bit harder, I suggest you join them next year as well.\n\nFeel free to dm if you have any more questions, I\u2019m no longer at Imperial, but I live relatively close to the white city campus",

            "comment": "They might have free rooms left in Parsons House it's a cheap Imperial hall for second years and above, idk if they accept doctorates and it's probably not the best fit for you considering what you're looking for, but it's something you can check out as last resort I guess. \nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/accommodation/current-residents/afterfirstyear/parsons/\n\nEdit: If you're going to ask, you can ask if they have free rooms in Evelyn Gardens as well it's a hall for second years and above too. It's way more nice in terms of facilities and community than the other one, but it's further away from white city and more expensive. It's close to the south kensington campus tho and you can get the free shuttle bus from there to white city and back. \nThe email you should be sending your queries to if you're going to do this is accommodation@imperial.ac.uk",

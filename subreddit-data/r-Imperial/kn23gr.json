    "postText": "Hey, so I've put Imperial as my Firm choice, starting 2021, and now I'm currently looking at the Accommodation Halls at Imperial and there seems to be ALOT of halls. I have seen almost all of the halls from the website but I wanted some advice from the students who used to live/currently live in these halls. I am quite interested in Beit, Southside, Eastside, Wilson - hence I really want honest opinions on these halls in particular. Any advice about the location, cost, rooms, building, etc would be nice. Which is the best hall at Imperial in your opinion?",

            "comment": "I only really know about the hall I went to (Woodward) and what I'll say is don't rule it out just yet. Maybe except for Kemp Porter it's got the best facilities, definitely one of the more social halls, good access to supermarkets, good storage space in the kitchens and the commute isn't *that* bad. It's best to commute with friends on your course. The only times the location got a bit annoying was when I had to go back in to campus for things in the evening.",

            "comment": "From my experience, everyone ends up enjoying where they live in first year. All the halls have their pros and cons, if you want to be 5 minutes away choose Southside, Eastside or Biet for a premium. If you want larger rooms at a more reasonable price, Woodward is best. On the travel to and from Woodward, it can take a while but you usually do it with course-mates so its not too bad. Woodward also has (in my first year at least) one of the better social lives as they understand they're a bit isolated so an extra effort is made to have a good time. Wilson is half-way between the two, not as cheap as Woodward or spacious, but closer - but not as close as Southside, Eastside or Beit. The walk across Hyde Park is also quite nice and can help with taking your mind off work and gives you some added exercise which can help with stress. The dogs are also a lovely sight every morning. If you're set on being close-by, I feel like Beit had a better community and environment than Eastside or Southside - and personally I liked the decor better.\n\nBut again, it's more who you live with and make friends with, rather than where you're staying for your first year.\n\nOh, just don't go Pembridge - my mates said it wasn't very good (but that could just be personal opinion).",

The facilities are good and they are large enough that it is easy to form a good social group. I had friends in Biet. It was decent but got noisy in the evenings with the student union below. I personally wouldn't have wanted to live there.",

            "comment": "I was in Pembridge (Notting Hill) but spent lots of time in Southside (this was over a decade ago, however -- Eastside had only just been built). If you can afford it, definitely go for Southside or Eastside. The only reason you would want to go for a different one is if your budget is limited. Being so close to campus, with good modern facilities, right by the Ethos gym etc is definitely worth the extra cost in my view.",

            "comment": "I was in southside in the 2014-15 school year, it was great. Socially it was super duper active with tons of people always going out. It's across the road from campus which is just great, so it's super easy to make your 9am's and it's a walk's distance from Union/Beit. It's also very quiet if you want it to be, unlike Beit which was a mess and is right above union.\n\nIt's also a short walk from SK underground where you can grab Piccadilly, which runs 24 hours on weekends and is super useful to get to/from clubs if that's your cup of tea.\n\nIf you can afford it, southside/Eastside is great.",

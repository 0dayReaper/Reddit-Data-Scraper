    "postText": "I heard that it is difficult to secure a UROP in the Chemistry Department as they require you to also secure a bursary to conduct research with a faculty member. How true is this? Additionally, is it hard to do a UROP during term time? How common is it for students in Imperial to do a UROP? Are there many professors specifically in the Chemistry Department receptive to taking in undergraduate students to assist in their research projects? Thank you so much for your responses guys! I received an offer from Imperial a few weeks ago and I want to check the availability of research opportunities in the uni.",

If you are okay with working for free for two or so months then you can probably do so. If you want to get paid for your time (which you should) you need to apply for the colleges urop bursary.\n\nSometimes UROPs are advertised, with a goal and funding all set, but many times you can self propose one. To do that you need a supervisor on board and you will need to deal with funding yourself. You will probably have someone to ask to supervise you by the end of your first year.\n\nTerm time urops are rare, and usually only happen if a summer project runs into term time, but I highly doubt supervisors would be okay with you taking time from your studies to do UROP work.",

            "comment": "So I\u2019m in Chemistry, but haven\u2019t personally done a UROP - although I do know a bit about the process, through friends on my course and whatnot.\n\nFrom what I understand, in the chemistry department UROPs are ran a bit differently to other departments in the university. We have a fairly early deadline for finding a UROP, I believe in January, whereas most departments don\u2019t actually *have* a deadline, I believe.\n\nThey are competitive, and you have to put a fair bit of work into getting one, as I understand it. \n\nProfessors will each be taking on an amount of UROP students they are happy to deal with - it varies by professor I believe, with some taking like six, and some just one or two, if any. \n\nIf you want any sort of renumeration for the UROP, you\u2019ll need to get a bursary. There\u2019s some from the college itself, some from the RSC, etc, and you have to apply and compete for those. You might not get one - you can still do the UROP either way, but you just won\u2019t get money for it.\n\nAnd I\u2019m pretty confident there is no opportunity at all to do a UROP during term time within the chemistry department. For one, you absolutely will not have time, and I also believe the professors are normally busy as well - for example with Masters and Bsc projects, which will run the length of termtime.\n\nAs a side note, since you\u2019re still just considering the offer, bear in mind that lectures in the Chemistry department are still online, and despite our efforts as students to get them to change back to in person lectures, I have not seen any indications that they will be doing that move any time soon. So it is likely lectures will be prerecorded, online, remote lectures for the first year or two of your degree, at least. That may work for you, it may not, but that is something to bear in mind!",

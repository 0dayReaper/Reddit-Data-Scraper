    "postText": "I may hear a decision from Imperial this month, and I wanted to ask current, or former, Engineering students about their experience throughout the years. I have read all the information on the Imperial website about course structure, modules, etc. (specifically for Mechanical Engineering).\n\nI'd appreciate any advice or stories from people who have experienced any of the Engineering courses first-hand. I have written some example questions below:\n\nWhat was your timetable and workload like in a typical week? What did you do outside of lectures and independent study? What did you find most difficult? For those in Y3/4, did you feel, from what you had learnt so far, that you were sufficiently-prepared to do project work? Who did you turn to for help?",

            "comment": "Alright so, let's take it one at a time:\n\nTimetable and workload are variable through each year and each term. Years 1 and 2 have lots of timetabled teaching sessions, so it is not unusual that you are at uni 10 to 4 with an hour break. Workload comes in waves, there's a constant medium load of \"homework\" (in quotes because it is not checked, it's only for you) with spikes of coursework, like design projects or lab reports. Similar spikes eight before exams of course. In average, it is the load you expect, not easy but by no means impossible. Third and fourth year has a lot less teaching and a lot more coursework, in the form of big design or research projects along with smaller coursework bits. Free time is still not much because there is lots of things to do. Similar cycles of workload apply.\n\nOutside of lectures you can join any of the numerous societies, but I just hanged with friends and played catan or super smash brothers in the main lecture theater every Friday. There are things to do and some time to do so apart from working.\n\n\nSo, being in year 4 and working two jobs, imperial mecheng has equipped me with more than enough knowledge and experience for project work. Things like the big 3rd year project and mandatory teaching of how to use heavy machinery give you more than enough experience. So much so that working with other engineers from other unis is a bit jarring, we all think \"how tf can they not know this?\". So ye, you will have more than enough project experience if you come looking for that.\n\nIn terms of help, the staff is more than helpful, whether that is the technical staff, the lecturers or the mental health people. Everyone has their door open and you can literally either pop in to someone to ask a question or ask for an hourlong meeting with a lecturer that probably doesn't know who you are. So ye, lots of help and lots of avenues to find it.\n\nAll in all, ye it's nice.",

Do they do practice tests, like you would have done throughout A-Levels?\n\nDid you personally enjoy A-Levels (e.g. Maths, Physics, etc.), or did you find them quite boring at times? Are you more motivated by the possibilities of engineering (e.g. the end product) or the process of solving maths/physics problems?\n\nFor the homework which isn't marked, do they give you answers after you've attempted the question, so you can see if you did it correctly?\n\nComing from Y2, how did you find the start of Y3, in terms of figuring-out what you're supposed to do for the group project and how to make it a success?",

                            "comment": "Year 1 was much like the continuation of IB (I did IB so I cannot speak of A levels). You have some exams on Christmas but they are minor compared to the finals. You get three past papers per final exam (officially) if you do need to practice as such. \n\nI enjoyed IB, though at times it gets tedious. For your other question, Engineering is always a mix of the two. I am driven by the final product definitely, but to get there you also need the theory solving part. If you cannot make one or the other you will have problems as an engineer. Either that or you exclusively become a researcher or go to heavy industry.\n\nFor the tutorial sheets, you get all the questions at about the same time plus minus a week you get the answers. You can immediately check your answer, and for some courses you even get the lecturer to solve some problems in class, which is extremely helpful.\n\nBy the time I got to year three I already had three projects under my belt, all part of the university. I also had another two projects during summer time. So by the time year three came by, I had experience to take on a project, expertise to focus on a particular part of it, and knowhow to know where to look for new info I may need. So by third year the big project is hard but that's because you have to put lots of work in, not because you do not know what you are doing.",

I noticed the Y1/2 spec. has modules such as 'Professional Engineering Skills' and 'Design and Manufacture'. \n\nWere the other two projects part of a summer placement you applied for?\n\nAs for programming skills, did you primarily learn Python?\n\nOnce you have finished Y4, will you be looking for full-time work or continuing your education? What sectors are of most interest to you? What country do you want to work in?",

One was in first year and was just making plans, and the other two were in second year, one we made our thing and one was a 1-week intensive design session. All three are part of the curriculum. We also do labs interspersed between all these, I would guess j submitted about 8 lab reports in first year and another 6 in second year, but those usually don't take more than two days of your time. PES is the course that the labs fall under and DFM is the design course. I also did a few projects on my own time, like a modular CO2 absorption column, so you have time to do things like that as well. \n\nThe other two projects were part of my UROP project, where I get to work in uni on something. First year was generally helping out to improve the first year design module and second year was to make a 3d printer filament recycler. If you want to do similar you can, if you want to do research instead you also can.\n\nFor programming my year group did MATLAB, but the years right after do Python. I also did C for a third year course and C# for my final year project. You do get lots of opportunities to do programming and hone your knowledge, whether that is data analysis for the labs or, in later years, for control and optimisation.\n\nNow that I am about to finish year 4 I want to continue to a PhD. I am waiting to see if I get a scholarship so fingers crossed. I will probably be working while doing a PhD to make ends meet, and because PhDs have a lot of time where you do nothing. Otherwise I am interested in working somewhere in manufacturing, RnD and project management. Many people want the same, even more want to go to consultancy, robotics, banking etc. I would like to continue working in the UK but I also want to return home after a while. The UK is great to work in, but nothing beats home.",

I\u2019m a resitting first year EEE student who failed both Maths 1A and 1B and then failed the August resits. I was 95% sure that I would fail these resits and get kicked out, but now I am just over the moon that I got PP, and can continue to study at Imperial. That\u2019s all and good luck to everyone.",

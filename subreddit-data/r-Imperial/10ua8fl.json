In comparison to the difficulty of the sample paper(which was decent tbh), what really is the difficulty level of the actual exam? Also, do the sample papers rly help for even a few questions or do they not at all. Finally, best way to revise?",

As for revision, Edexcel\u2019s mixed exercises in their Core Pure 2 Further Maths textbook should be ample if you cover Methods in Calculus, Hyperbolic Functions, Complex Numbers etc. (can\u2019t think of more off of the top of my head). Best of luck with the exam!",

    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nI was just offered a job-position as a software engineer at Imperial College London prior returning to education for a PhD. So ICL is the best compromise because I will still be around education while working as a Soft. Eng. Moreover, it is a one-year agreement. Indeed, the role and the team appear to be quite amazing \u2705 However, I was curious as to if any of you have experience with Soft. Eng. at ICL and how it went? both during and post-job ? Was it beneficial to have worked there (having imperial college london on your curriculum vitae)? \n\nAdditionally, is a salary of roughly \u00a340,000 per year appropriate for a junior profile there?\n\nI appreciate your understanding. \n\nCheers,\ud83c\udf89",

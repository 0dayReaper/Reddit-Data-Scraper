    "postText": "Hi! I am interested in the MSc in Business Analytics at Imperial. I wanted to know people's experience with the application process and requirements. I only found this program a few days ago and I saw that they are still accepting applications for the online program of 2022 entry. However, I have not taken a GMAT exam yet. Although it is not required, it is recommended on their website as part of the documents to submit. Also, it is important to note that they recommend a score in the 90th percentile for the score to be considered competitive. I could take the GMAT test and apply but I do not know how likely it is that I will achieve a 90th percentile score from the first attempt. I have never studied for it before. For some context, I am a recent engineering graduate and I don't have much job experience yet as I will start my full time job in a few months.   \n\n\nI am wondering how the pool of accepted applicants looks like and if most have done the GMAT. I want to know if I should put of applying this year until I do the GMAT or if I still have a good chance without it. If anyone who got accepted wants to give me some insight by commenting, I would really appreciate it. I  am also open to DMing if you are more comfortable with that.   \n\n\nI hope someone can help. Thank you in advance!",

Like you I had little time to prepare, sat for it and it was not that great so I just applied with out it (my 1st degree is math so like you I think its not really needed). So if you don\u2019t need it and your marks for engineering were good I\u2019d apply.",

I have another question, if you don't mind. Did you have a lot of  internships or previous work experience on your resume before applying? \n\nAnd Thank you so much for giving me some insight into your experience!",

I got an equivalent to a 2:1 in the UK system so I was not sure if that alone would make a good impact. \n\nAnother concern I have is references. I have referees I can ask but I don't want to have to ask them twice in case I don't get accepted this time. If that makes sense.  \n\n\nThank you so much for your reply! I appreciate it.",

And what about the Quantitative Assessment?**   \nI have an Undergrad Engineering Degree from Warwick (2017) and 4 years of Work Experience. Did not cover Linear Algebra, Statistics, etc in my Undergrad at Warwick",

                    "comment": "Hi, I think I can help with this.  \nIt is basically just a few courses you list to show that you have some quantitative experience. Since you have an engineering degree, you should have a lot of that. I think any engineering degree has to involve some calculus and linear algebra as a minimum. I would say check your transcripts from university and see which courses are similar to that and list those. For example, you can list any advanced calculus, linear algebra, statistics, or any computational courses you took. If you can't find any, you can ask the university what you can do instead.\n\n For the SQL and Python knowledge, you can list those separately and elaborate on them as part of your application. Overall, I would say you probably satisfy this requirement.\n\nHope this helps!",

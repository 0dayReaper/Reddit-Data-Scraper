            "comment": "Your best bet is to email/call the college. I'm pretty sure they're able to change the offer, however that's only if they're willing to. I have a feeling they prefer to use STEP for the vast majority of candidates because it provides a fairly consistent basis on which to discriminate between 'good' and 'bad' candidates.\n\nIt also comes down to the department, and DoC are a bit funny I think. I'm in my 4th Year now in EEE, but when I was applying c. 2017/18 a guy at my school interviewed for Computing and they clearly recognised he was smart, but didn't like him very much. They ended up giving him an offer requiring 5A\\*s (he was taking 5 A Levels) and a 1 in STEP 3, which is well above what they usually offer. (He ended up going to Durham).\n\nTo take something positive from that though, it means that they may be willing to deviate from the 'standard' offers they give out on a case-by-case basis, so hopefully you'll be able to convince them.",

Though I think they've stopped offering STEP 1.\n\nThe grades for STEP are S, 1, 2, 3, U (descending order). So yeah, a 2 in STEP 2 is a fair bit easier than a 1 in STEP 3.\n\nFor reference, Trinity College Cambridge usually requires a 1, 1 in STEP 2&amp;3 if you want to study maths there.\n\nI can't really recommend what to say, since it's a bit of a shot in the dark. If they don't know about your AP scores, tell them, and if you're considering extra AP classes that you could do instead of STEP tell them which ones specifically. Otherwise, I'd just ask them to help you with registering for, and taking the STEP paper in the US, because I can imagine that it's a bit more complicated than it is in the UK.",

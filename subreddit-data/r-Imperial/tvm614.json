    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm an international student from an Asian country, and I'm trying to decide on my undergraduate school. I currently prefer Imperial over the two other choices because of its high-quality CS education, close-knit and supportive department, and good reputation in the tech industry.\n\nHowever, one concern I have is that I plan to work in the US after my graduation. I do have plan to complete a post-graduate study (very likely in the US). So now my question is: Is it easy to get into top US schools for CS/CS-related masters after graduating from Imperial? \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated!!",

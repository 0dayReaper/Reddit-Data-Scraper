    "postText": "Hey guys, need your help with a major decision here. I'm stuck between two options for my graduate studies starting in Fall 2023: Waterloo\uff08major in Electral computing Engineering\uff09or Imperial College(major in material engineering). Here are the pros:\n\nWaterloo:\n1. Got into ECE and it's research-based.\n2. Funding from my supervisor\n\nImperial:\n1. High overall and specialized program rankings in material engineering.\n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

If you want to go onto a PhD, then a good supervisor who will give you solid research experience (and ideally a publication) would be the priority. Otherwise the prestige of the programme or school is probably the most important thing.",

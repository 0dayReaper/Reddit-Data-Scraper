Just make sure that any place you're interested in actually exists before paying anything.\n\nA lot of postgrads will be in non-student accommodation. As a student you shouldn't have to pay any council tax so do check what's in your contract if you're going somewhere that has bills included. \n\nImperial should be able to advise if you contact student services, and may be able to recommend some sites or know ofsome local vacancies. The London housing market can be challenging - good luck!",

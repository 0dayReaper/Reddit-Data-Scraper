    "postText": "So I have recently received an offer from imperial for computing and I would like to know about accomodation and how it works, currently I know that there is a form that you input your 5 choices that you\u2019d be fine with living in and you are guaranteed to get one but my question is are there more halls than what\u2019s on the website because I want to live nearby the campus but there is east side,south and beit hall preferably I would like to live in beit but I don\u2019t want to live in Wilson because of the 60 person kitchen is putting me off. And North Acton and Xenia are quite far. Are there any alternatives?",

            "comment": "There are only the ones you listed (for first year at least).  A trick is to apply for beit, southside single room, southside twin room single occupancy, and the same for east side. So you have 5 options but only in the three south kensington accoms. \n\nKeep in mind you still aren\u2019t guaranteed one of the 5 choices but this maximises your chances if you don\u2019t mind paying a bit more for twin room single occupancy.",

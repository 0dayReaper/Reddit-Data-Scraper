    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019ve recently got an offer for MEng Aeronautical Engineering at Imperial. I\u2019m an EU student and this year is the first that we are classified as Overseas for fee purpose so all the international scholarships that I have found only apply to other countries like US, Canada or whatever. I, however, do not have 34k pounds obviously, as I had an approach get in first - worry later (tbh I just kimda assumed I would be rejected bc Imperial is my dream school) :) \nIn order to be able to study I would have to find 24k pounds, as 10k is max i can pay. As I was browsing scholarhips in my home country, I figured there actually aren\u2019t any (Yay!!!) Do you have any experience where as a potential Imperial Aero student could I look for funds or maybe if i can have some job somewhere? I would be super grateful. Going to Imperial is my DREAM. Also I am a girl so maybe there is some kinda \u201ewomen in stem\u201d scholarship somewhere? Anyways any help will be much appreciated!!!",

Obviously that does not apply anymore and hence EU studentship is expected to dramatically drop. \n\nAlso, Imperial only provides (significant) scholarships to UK residents, which means there is no luck looking there. \n\nAbout women in stem, I have heard some going around, but few to the amount of 34k. If anyone imeche and the relevant organisation may have some, idk I haven't checked. \n\nWorking a part time job is not recommended but not impossible. If all else fails, you can put in the hours to at least make money to survive.\n\nOut of curiosity, you said you applied to the US as well. Did you not find similar or higher fees for schools there?",

Although a quick search doesnt look promising.\n\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/scholarships-search-tool/\n\nNonetheless this has always a been a challenge, made much worse by brexit. I\u2019ve seen people who managed to get their funsing from lots of smaller (\u00a32-5k) sources. If by job you meant finding a company to pay for your training, that can be very promising as well. You should try to see if employers of aeronautical engineers do these kinds of programmes (with strings attached of course).",

            "comment": "If you end up getting desperate, the UK government does offer loans for students. I know for sure they offer loans for tuition fees for EU students doing BSc courses, I'm not sure if they do for postgraduate courses. At any rate, have a look at this website, because it also includes links to scholarship websites, as well as information on if you're eligible for tuition fee loans:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/funding-for-postgraduate-study\n\nAt any rate, 34k is a lot of money, and I think it might be more useful to take a less expensive program. Scholarships for Masters courses are really, really rare, especially for foreign students, so unless you can put the money up yourself some how, I think going for a less expensive option might be viable. Or, defer for a year and work to get some extra money. I would definitely not advise trying to work while you study to make up the extra cash, just in case that's an idea you have.",

You could email the government contact and just clarify to be sure, that's what I'd do.\n\nBut to be honest that's a lot of money each year. UK people complain about paying 9k a year and we have plenty of loans to cover us, so paying 34k a year is a huge commitment. I would agree with the other comments about looking towards mainland Europe, because they tend to have better funding options for EU students than we do in the UK. To be honest, you could do a standard BSc in mainland Europe and then come to Imperial for an MRes or other masters degree to top it up, that's what I did in my area of expertise and it really helped out my career. It would also be a lot more affordable, since you'd have three years to gather a little more funding, and by that point there might be more funding options for EU students in the UK!",

Now here comes the bad news, as far as i know there is not much for EU students (possibly because we used to be covered, maybe the situation will improve with time). I would ask this question also on r/academia or something like that, they might be able to tell you more international or niche scholarship we might not be aware of.

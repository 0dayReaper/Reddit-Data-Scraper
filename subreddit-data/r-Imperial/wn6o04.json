(Which might sometimes be 'Foo and Bar' or 'Bar with Foo' or whatever, but it's still not 'majoring' in one with a 'minor' in the other.)\n\nImperial does (? Did I should say) have the 'Horizons' programme though, which allows you to take a course in various humanities/languages - one per term (some are two terms long) - which is (/was) mandatory in first year and optional afterwards. They give ECTS credit and appear on your transcript (just like any course part of your actual programme) but it's not a 'minor', won't affect the title or number of degrees you're awarded.",

A typical sixth former takes just 3 or 4 subjects (Imperial applicants probably mostly 4), for STEM subjects commonly 2 of which will be mathematics ('Mathematics' and 'Further Mathematics' - there's even a third 'Additional' which the particularly keen/mathematicians can take) and the other(s) might be say Physics or Chemistry. So people generally have a pretty good idea of what they want to study while still in school (a term which doesn't include university here, just to confuse you ;)) and if not they're figuring it out _then_, not once they've started.\n\n(e.g. I studied mathematics, further mathematics, physics, and electronics at A level, then Electronic &amp; Information Eng. at Imperial.)",

            "comment": "The UK system feels more like a high school continuation than the US system. For the first year or so you basically have no choice in what courses you get (barring horizons as mentioned before). In Mech Eng, first two years are all mandatory courses, third year you get some electives and fourth year you get mostly electives. A minority of electives has prerequisites but that will be very clear (e.g. robotics and advanced robotics). Some electives are only for your course but some are college wide (e.g. optimisation). You can see what courses are available to you in the website.\n\nThere is no major and minor. Only difference to your degree would be the occasional year abroad or year in industry.",

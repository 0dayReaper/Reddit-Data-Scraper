    "postText": "I've got an uncon offer for Msc Chemistry this autumn. My offer condition includes  IB grade 40 in total, 7 in chem HL, 6 in MAA HL, Econ HL and English. But earlier today the IB grade released, I met all the rest but I got a 6 in Chem HL, which does not satisfy the condition (7). Additionally, I got 84/100 and the boundary for 7 is merely at 85/100. Is there any possibilities if I could retrieve my offer by arguing with Imperial? Are there any past student who successfully obtained the offer of Imperial given that they miss the condition?",

None of us can really say whether or not you have any chances, you just have to call the department, say you missed it by one mark (I assume you\u2019ll get it remarked as well? I don\u2019t know how IB works, tbh - but if you are tell them you are), and would love to still attend the course.",

You got the grade you got, and you either get it re-assessed or accept your grade.\n\nI certainly cannot imagine this tactic working with imperial, they're not going to struggle for students this year.\n\nOp has a good chance because the IB is very highly sought after at universities, and chemistry isn't a high demand course, but you never know what imperial is gunna do.",

You can argue with them if they make a decision you don't like but you have to go in realistic in the fact that they gave you an offer you don't meet so they are well within thier rights to reject you.\n\nImperial will either:\n- give you the place (this can and does happen)\n- reject you\n- place you on hold until A-Level results because they're not prepared to reject you yet.\n\nNo one here can tell you because past performance doesn't really give you a good idea of what they'll do this year. It's been very volitile over the past 3 years. Call thier admissions team and get your information from the horses mouth.",

The receptionist told me that I have been placed on the \u201cnear missing\u201d list. She asked me to apply for a re-mark of my ib grade. If the re-marking fails, then I should have to wait until mid August for all a level student get their grades and then reconsider my application. If I meet the condition by re-marking, then I directly get the unconditional offer.\n\nThat\u2019s what they told me. Probably because they think that I only missed the condition a little. So they would be willing to reconsider me in August. I have a friend who missed two conditions, and they told him to remark but nothing about reconsideration. Guess they will only reconsider those \u201cnear missing\u201d candidates\u2026",

Pass the first stage and you will receive to complete an online test. \n3. Pass the test as you will receive an email to select supervisors/projects (1st choice and 2nd choice project). This includes to write why you want to do the project and some other stuff. So, like a new application again. \n4. Pass that screening (your answers on 3, the test results on 2, and your docs in 1 all matter here) and you get invited for interviews. That can mean that you passed for both selections or only one. \n5. You create a small presentation and you have 30 mins interview with the professors that selected you. \n6. Wait for results.",

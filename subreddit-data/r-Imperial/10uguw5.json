    "postText": "Hello, I would like to know something regarding the school and what you think. I\u2019ve applied to the master in international management (still waiting for the decision\u2019s school). I would like to know if I get accepted in the master in international management I could ask them to change for the master in finance?\n\nAt first I wanted to apply for both, then I realized I could only apply for one master each year (I didn\u2019t know as in my current school you can apply to as many master as you want)\n\nThe Master in finance would be of course my first choice if it\u2019s possible to change.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "You can drop a note to them about this but it seems unlikely once the application has been sent out. While preparing your application, there will be an option to choose preferences ig you should've chosen it then. MiM and MSc Finance are a bit different when it comes to curriculum but there is a possibility that if imperial finds your profile to be more suitable for finance, they will provide an offer for that. This has happened in the past as well.",

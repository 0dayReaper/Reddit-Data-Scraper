    "postText": "Title. I'm not a student at Imperial, but I attend another European university and was looking for research placements in Europe when I found out about UROP. Does anyone have experience applying for UROP either as a student at Imperial or some other institution? If so, what was the application process like, and where are research opportunities posted? I'm guessing chances of getting a placement is lower for visiting students, but it would be cool to hear from someone else who did the same.",

            "comment": "I have done three UROPs in total (shock, gasp). Most of the times the story goes that A) some researcher advertises a position B ) you go to a lecturer asking for money or a summer job C) you have an idea of what to do and find a lecturer or researcher to fund it or D) you have been working with a member of staff before and want to continue through the summer. \n\nAbout application, I've gotten money all three times, it's a boilerplate application about what you want to do. I do not know how it changes for people outside imperial (seeing how I was payed from three separate accounts) \n\nThat being said, best bet is to have it sorted out with a member of staff and the money will come through one way or another. Find a person that shares your interests or research focus and shoot them an email.",

Also, did you find a research project through a posting, or did you have some idea of what you specifically wanted to do? (I.e. was it clear exactly what you would do research on when you contacted the researcher, or did you have to come up with something by yourself).",

Second year I made a machine to mix polymers and recycle 3d printing filament (it still isn't working because CNC work is slow). Third year I created the CAD design part of the mechanical design course for chemical engineers. I do not have the most orthodox urop experience but at least it's diverse.",

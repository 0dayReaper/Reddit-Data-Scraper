I haven\u2019t seen 2021 entry accommodation information, but I\u2019m a first year in a KP twin room, and it\u2019s great.\n\nThe twin rooms are *more per week* than normal, because they are single occupancy. It\u2019s in the contract, so if it says \u2018single occupancy twin room\u2019 that\u2019s guaranteed",

I\u2019m predicted a first and have had marketing work experience, but I am worried I haven\u2019t had a high enough level of taught quantitative skills. Honest opinions on whether I should apply? It would be useful to know what they priories in the application process",

Send one of the professors a short and polite email, explaining your situation and asking for their thoughts.\n\nI'd usually always say it's best to err on the side of applying and see what happens then. If you get a positive response then all's good, if it's negative then perhaps you can chase some feedback on the application. You never know, but first see if the course website lists email addresses for faculty members who might be able to answer your questions first.",

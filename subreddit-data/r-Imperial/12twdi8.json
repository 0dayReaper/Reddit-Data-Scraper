    "postText": "I have 2 options to choose from and I need help deciding-\n\n1. Student accommodation (Chapters etc)- I can\u2019t find a decent studio at less than 350pw\n\n2. Living at a PG in Bounds Green owned by friends - My meals will be included in flat payment of 1000pm and I will also have wifi, washing machine, kitchen access included. Only downside is missing out on student life.\n\nTravel time from any of the above to South Kensington is the same. My course is MSc Business Analytics at ICBS and some seniors told me I won\u2019t really have time to loaf around a lot given the pressure and work load  so that\u2019s another thing. Budget is definitely an issue for me, I\u2019ll have to take a larger loan to stay at a student acco but I also don\u2019t want to miss out on anything.",

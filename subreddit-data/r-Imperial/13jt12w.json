    "postText": "International here! I currently hold a conditional offer for the BSc Physics program. I was wondering whether I would be able to apply and actually secure any significant financial aid in my second/third year. Also, would it be \"doable\" to have a job while studying at Imperial and managing coursework? And would it be enough to cover living expenses (assuming a little over minimum wage)? Lastly, are scholarships for the 4th year generous? \n\nThank you for your time!",

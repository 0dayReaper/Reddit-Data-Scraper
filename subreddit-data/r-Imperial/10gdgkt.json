Some specific things are:\n\n* Students to bathroom/kitchen ratio\n* Are the bathrooms/kitchens usually kept clean?\n* What's the area like?\n* Any problems with mice, damp, etc?\n* What's the bike storage like?\n* What's the furnishing like: new, old, tired?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I haven\u2019t lived in Wilson but I have been there and I have lived right across from it.\n\nThe commute from Wilson to imperial is one of the prettiest in London, down Sussex gardens and through Hyde park. It is a lovely walk and only takes like 25 mins. When it\u2019s too cold it\u2019s a bit of a problem but you\u2019re saving so much money.\n\nThe area is nice, one thing imperial won\u2019t tell you is that Sussex gardens is one of the biggest prostitution spots in London, but to me that was a great feature cause it meant there were people on the street at literally all times, you don\u2019t feel scared even if you walk home at like 4 in the morning alone. Take that as you may.\n\nNow a question you\u2019re not asking is the student to door ratio, that number is orders of magnitude away from the other halls.",

Edgware Road is just a short walk away, 24 hour supermarkets, good restaurants and a nice walk through Hyde Park in the morning to make it to the South Ken campus. If you\u2019re a medic, St Mary\u2019s Hospital is just behind Wilson. Mayfair is a 10 minute walk away, nice going there to see billionaires zooming past in their Bugattis. Oxford street a 10 minute walk away too. Since I was there they\u2019ve modernised the rooms substantially. Would definitely recommend - amazing experience and unforgettable memories",

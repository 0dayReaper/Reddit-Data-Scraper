However, there are a very limited number of staff members willing to give UROPs to first year students - the best way to find out is to contact people whom you might be interested in doing a research project with after year 1.\n\nPS: Wait until uni starts, experience different fields/modules and then decide what you like...",

If you have some programming experience already then you have a bit of an advantage as the computing department assumes 1st years have no prior computing experience. You will learn the things you need to learn for the other modules when you start uni, so don't worry about it!",

    "postText": "There have been a number of posts recently asking about interviews, how to apply, how hard it is, etc. This is going to be slightly unusual in contrast: I'm going to write about why I left, and why many of the people I know who went were miserable.  \n\n#1 The university system is broken\n\nBefore you've even sat your final exams, but with 15 or more years of education under your belt, you have to choose a subject you want to study, and with very little knowledge where you want to do it. You're likely to be quite burnt out, and you probably don't know what you'd actually most enjoy. *Subjects at university are a different beast to the thing you studied at school*.  \n\nThe ideal thing to do for most people, irrelevant of how smart you are, would be to take a year out, grow up a little and figure out what you really want to do. Obviously this is easier said than done, so I'm not going to bang on about it.  \n\nStudying the wrong thing and being bored of education are not problems solely endemic to Imperial. But they're made much worse because...  \n\n#2 Imperial is really hard  \n\nNot all courses are created equal, but by and large Imperial is a very difficult place to study. You are given a lot of work, attend a lot of lectures and are expected to cover it all quickly. In many regards this is great - you're given a good education, and degrees from Imperial are highly valued in competitive markets for jobs and further study. In others it's not - if you don't want to work in investment banking or management consultancy, or become a top flight academic, you're unnecessarily putting yourself in an ecosystem where you're more likely to fail.  \n\nThings being hard is fine. By and large if you've got in you're capable of graduating, it's just a matter of putting in the work. However this is made much worse than it need be by the fact...  \n\n#3 Pastoral care is non-existent  \n\nI have experience of a number of different universities, and more-so than anywhere else at Imperial you are nothing more than a number. To make it brutally clear: *it's water off everybody involved's back if you fail*.\n\nYour professors are published and well respected. Your TAs already have degrees. Plenty of people have gone through the system before you. Again: the people teaching you are in no way personally invested in how well you do, they've got nothing to prove.  \n\nI hear you cry: 'But /u/Elemesh, these people are well intentioned, they chose to teach for a reason!'. You're not wholly wrong: some really do care. But the reality of the situation is they lecture to hundreds of people, and will never even get the chance to learn your name. Of the others, many only lecture because they're contractually obligated to, and they really don't do a good job of it. This is also true of your tutors (I met mine once a year) and the people taking your seminars.  \n\nImperial is too big. At universities with smaller and more intimate teaching environments your education is always going to better fit you, and you're going to feel more like a valued human. Because you are. The syllabus at Oxbridge will look a lot like your one at Imperial, and you'll work nearly as hard, but the way it's delivered is fundamentally better.  \n\nThe rates of mental illness at Imperial are unlike anything else. I knew almost nobody without a diagnosis of depression or stress. I have no shame in admitting my bias that being at Imperial contributed badly to my depression. This lack of care about your life by the powers that be would be better, if it weren't the case that...\n\n#4 Making friends at Imperial is a challenge  \n\nOne of the other things peculiar to Imperial is how strongly cliquey it is. I shared a room in halls in first year with a guy from Singapore. We exchanged a total of 4000 words over the course of the entire year. Across the university, you have huge groups of foreign nationals who hang out only amongst themselves and you'll therefore never get to know. That cuts out 50%+ of people already. Of those that remain, the odds are perhaps good, but the goods are odd. I'm going to avoid stereotypes, but I found it very difficult to find people at Imperial I wanted to be friends with. No one, in fact, and I was an elected member of a large society, so it's not like I didn't know anybody. \n\n#Conclusion - Think carefully  \n\nAssuming you graduate, Imperial will give you a great degree, and you'll live in one of the best cities on the planet. The question is whether these are worth trading for your happiness whilst there. Some people love Imperial, I know a few, and they have the willpower and enjoy their subject so much they don't feel the full impact of these problems. But if what I've said instilled any doubt in your mind, have a long hard think about what you want in life. I'm happy to reply to comments in the thread or PMs.  \n\nWherever you decide to go, good luck.",

            "comment": "I think the main thing that all students should realise is that in university, your education is up to you and its your responsibility to obtain it. There may be societal pressures to go to university but its not the law. Therefore, if you choose to pay money to attend university, I think it is more important to go with an open, accepting, flexible mindset and a willingness to learn. I believe attitude is more important than being absolutely 100% sure that you love the subject before you've even tried it, because even if you discover that you actually dislike this subject, it is fairly easy to change subjects at the end of the academic year. \n\nThe worse thing you could do for your happiness is to go with the expectation that there will be great pastoral care and you'll immediately find some great friends for life and all the lecturers will spend all their time with you, explaining everything to you like at school. I'm not disputing that it may sometimes feel like the staff do not 'care' about you but if you make minimal effort to interact with them, you also cannot expect them to remember you when they lecture 100 different students a day. Lecturers are under constant pressure to publish papers, submit grants, supervise under-grads, post-grads and post-docs. Frankly, they don't have time to go looking for more work. Yet still, I know many lecturers who actively ask the class to speak up if they don't understand something or have any questions, it's the class who choose not to. I'm also sure that lecturers will never turn you away if you visit them with a question that you don't understand. \n\nThe point is that you should be making the effort because you chose to attend the university. If you want to bond with the staff and the other students then you need to initiate the conversation; talk to them, ask them questions, attend social events and if you don't enjoy this then you should accept that they probably won't know who you are. Just remember, its all about your attitude. I'm sorry if this is harsh but of course it means little to the university if you fail, you are taking up a place that thousands of others are competing for; only you should care if you fail and if you do care then you should try your best to succeed. \n\nAnd I'm sorry but I must say, before people start having horrible judgments about Imperial students, that I have never found it difficult to make friends with people from different countries, even when their native language is not English. Perhaps the reason why you find it so difficult is because, from what you've written, it sounds like you are judging and stereotyping people and you have preconceptions about the type of person you want to be friends with and you didn't find them.\n\nTo wrap it up, honestly, its survival of the fittest. It always has been. It always will be. No matter which university you attend. And the working world will only be more brutal. The 'fittest' in this case doesn't simply mean the person with the best grades, it's also about having an open and adaptable mindset. So grow some thick skin and if you want to pay money to attend one of the top universities in the world for science, engineering and medicine, prove that you can handle it.",

I've been a few places and I believe workload is high in any serious university and I tend to think that it doesn't get any better once you start working in a company (it depends on what you do, of course). About pastoral care, every department has a different approach to tutoring, it is true that in some departments students don't see their tutors for ages, but in some others they see them every week (!). Perhaps everyone should adopt the same approach, once a week is a bit too much but once a year is definitely not enough for most students. As some people commented here, societies are a good thing to force people to socialise with others, still I understand that it is not always easy to make close friends in this multi-cultural environment, people in IC are from so many different places around the world that is not always easy to make close friends. By the way, I sometimes think that is more tough for local students to make friends in IC than it is for people from other countries because sometimes local students commute from home every day and they don't get to spend as much time with their classmates as others do. Anyway, all criticism is useful, thanks for sharing your thoughts!",

            "comment": "1 - Agree, although if you know what you want to get into it's perfect. I knew I wanted to do aeronautics so this was a non-issue for me. I can't really comment on this point.\n\n2 - Imperial is really hard, but therein lies the reason why their degrees are so valued.\n\n3 - There isn't 'mandatory' pastoral care. You're kind of thrown in the deep end here. You can just learn to swim (what most people do) but if you're really struggling you can ask the professors and tutors. But you have to take the initiative, this is a key point: they are happy to help when you go to them and will help you walk through the issues you're facing but if you don't go to them they will assume you have it under control.\n\n4 - I strongly disagree with this point. While it is true that a lot of the foreign students are cliquey (singaporean, malaysian and chinese in particular), I find they are lovely people when you get to know them. True, I had to make the effort to talk to them but when I did they were friendly, helpful and quite nice. Once you get a rapport going they'll come talk to you. Again, you have to take the initiative here. Speaking of the rest of Imperial, I didn't have problems making any friends and I did make some very close friends. I don't know your character OP, but if you didn't find anyone to be friends with then it kind of is really your fault (not trying to be offensive but simply stating my opinion).\n\n5 - I will add a negative and it's what I'm sure all of you know. Girls. With the ratio so heavily against you if you are a guy it really is quite hard but hey, people do manage it.\n\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed my time there but university is a different experience for everyone so ultimately it comes down to you.",

Of these \"major public unis [in the US]\" you'd probably find, what, 2 or 3 departments in a space the size of SK campus.\n\nThat said, it is large-ish by UK standards, and the postgraduate:undergraduate ratio is notably high.",

Struggling to make friends is on you - get out there and join some societies if you are lonely. \n\nYes, Imperial is hard, but that's because it's a top University and you have to work for your degree. If you want an easy ride then go for a lower ranked Uni. Do you think people at Cambridge, Oxford etc have it any easier? I now teach Biology at Oxbridge and my students have a lot more work than I ever had at Imperial.",

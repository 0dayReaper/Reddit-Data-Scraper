    "postText": "Recently, I found out that the college provides us with an extremely useful tool, Software Hub, where we can download apps that usually cost a lot for free. But it says that it does not support Mac OS. But contrarily, some apps in the hub are available for Mac OS. So how can I download those apps? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbtw, I need adobe apps (ps, pr, etc) recently, but I cannot find them in the hub. Are they free for Imperial alumni?   \n\n\nbtw again, will the college retrieve the college email account when I graduate?",

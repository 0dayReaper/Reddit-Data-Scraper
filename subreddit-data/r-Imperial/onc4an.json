    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nDoes anybody know if it's possible to transfer credits from another program outside Imperial to the MEng program? Or has somebody switched from Switzerland (Ethz/Epfl) to ICL? I tried contacting the admission office but I couldn't find an answer yet\n\n  \nI am currently studying Mechanical Engineering at the ETH Z\u00fcrich (QS top 6) and I would like to switch to Imperial for the master, although having good grades and a fairly strong CV respect to the guys studying with me, there is no way on earth I'm one of the 40 students they take for the Advanced Mechanical Engineering MSc. So I thought it could be a wise idea to try to get in the MEng course and catch up the credits Imperial does not recognize (however we got literally the same courses). I'm not sure it's possible and it surely won't be accepted generally, but I thought asking might be worth a try...\n\nThank you all",

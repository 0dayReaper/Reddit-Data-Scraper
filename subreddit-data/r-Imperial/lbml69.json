Given that it\u2019s 40 multiple choices in 30mjns, I guess the questions are quite short, so do u think it would b good to revise with the Cambridge admissions test past papers seeing as these are of a similar format? So far I\u2019ve just done some a level pure math past papers to revise since I do ib at school. What are u guys doing/what would u recommend?",

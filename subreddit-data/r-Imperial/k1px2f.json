Their course section also doesn't have a detailed explanation about the interview and selection process, so I'm really not sure what to expect. Have you heard back about Bioengineering interviews or know of anyone who has?",

I wouldn\u2019t worry too much - i have a couple friends waiting for interview for same course and they\u2019re credentials r pretty strong so i think they\u2019ll get one. Might just be the way they\u2019re doing the batches",

I have limited insight into the molecular interview, but from what I've heard it's somewhat similar to the biomedical engineering one (with which I have experience) so feel free to pm me if you want.",

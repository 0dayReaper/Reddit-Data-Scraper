I studied in an English school but I can tell you it\u2019s way more sophisticated than Calc BC or anything like that, a lot of americans find it hard and most don\u2019t make their offers (I don\u2019t even know any American offer holders in my year who made it)",

Start with Paper I first, that\u2019s the most common offer.\n\nI\u2019d say tackle pure maths more as most of the paper is Pure, applied are like 3 questions total.\n\nThe paper is judged on the best 6 question you attempted, so there is tactics to which questions to attempt and which to stop before it goes too long beyond your ability, and you only learn by doing those questions.\n\nThey go back to the 70s, so there will be endless questions for you to try, i do find the older papers slightly easier.\n\nAlso a note, this paper is non-calculator",

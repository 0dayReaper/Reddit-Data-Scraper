    "postText": "I applied to Imperial's Fall 2021 entry and I was declined, this was before my grades were out. Though I did get the entry requirements I was declined for not being competitive enough. I applied for engineering. I did end up being accepted in University of Manchester but I want to apply to Imperial again, but the problem is I would have to withdraw from Manchester. I have been looking everywhere for a website that gives me an acceptance chance like collegevine but there are no UK ones. So I can here for your opinions (I know grades aren't everything but they have a huge impact), I graduated with a 89 percent average for Grade 12, would that be worth applying to Imperial again (they ask for 85-90 average for grade 12). Also I wanted to know, is chemistry a required subject for engineering?",

I definitely didn't do one. You can always lie on a personal statement, but if you need to interview you'll probably be caught out.\n There's no way for someone to magically know whether you'll get in.\n Take a year out and reapply if you want, but it's always going to be a gamble. \n\nYou also haven't said what course you applied for which is pretty key to know if chemistry is required",

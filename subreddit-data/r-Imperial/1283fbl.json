    "postText": "Hiya I just received an offer to do a master's of design engineering (the one conjoined with RCA). I'm from New Zealand and the last time I was in London was when I was about 5. So I have a bunch of questions which I reckon current students would be the best people to ask:\n\n1. Where do I live? Should I do halls or a private residence, which is generally cheaper? How far out of the city will I need to go to get reasonable rent?\n\n2. Are there any interesting ways of getting funding eg asking a company (if so HOW\u203d)or little known about scholarships?\n\n3. Do you like studying at imperial? It seems like an amazing opportunity but also a lot of money (especially international fees)\n\n4. What's the maker space like? I've seen also the info on the website but idk the vibe",

            "comment": "It's been almost a decade since I was at Imperial but here's my take:\n\n1. I went for a private residence. It was a lot cheaper for me and I managed to find a place within 30 minutes' walk of Imperial. There are lots of websites that can help you find private accommodation (e.g [SpareRoom](https://www.spareroom.co.uk/)) but be aware that quality can be hit and miss depending on the landlord and some places are scams - it's always advised to visit a place in person before signing anything or paying any money. Some places may also include bills in the price, but if they don't they you'll need to sort those out yourself. A lot of Imperial students stay in the Fulham or Hammersmith areas or just north of Hyde Park which offer a good balance between price and distance.\nStudent accommodation can be a lot more convenient - no need to sort out bills, apply for council tax exemptions, etc - and you'll be surrounded by other students but you're often paying more for the additional conveniences. I'm not familiar with private student accommodation but do consider the distance from university. It might be worth contacting student accommodation to see if they have any recommendations or can put you in contact with other students in the same situation if you want to houseshare.\n\n\n2. If you've already Googled this, I'd suggest starting with contacting the student union to see if they have any suggestions. It might be too late but it never hurts to ask!\n\n\n3. I was only at Imperial for one year (UK student, Physics MSc) but I enjoyed my time there and I think the Imperial name helped me get my first job. London is expensive but there's always something to do or see, and a lot of places are free to visit (and a lot more that aren't).\n\n\n4. I used it a handful of times during the summer term after most of the university has finished - it was very quiet but I'm sure it's busier a lot of the rest of the year. It seemed well equipped and the people were knowledgable.\n\n\nGood luck with everything and I hope you have as good a time there as I did!",

    "postText": "Hello all, \nI submitted my application for the AI and Machine Learning MRes by the end of February (the 22nd) and I received the invitation to perform the four online MCQ tests beginning of March (the deadline for performing them was the 21st of March).\n\nAfter that, I have no news from Imperial since almost two months and don\u2019t know when to expect an interview. Is this a normal timeframe?\n\nSide question: what should I expect from the Interview? Other technical question or anything else? \n\nThank you very much in advance!",

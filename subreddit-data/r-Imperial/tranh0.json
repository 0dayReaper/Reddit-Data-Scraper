Read this post which made me even more worried: https://www.reddit.com/r/Imperial/comments/bby8g6/physics_student_satisfaction_i_know/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share.\n\nHowever I don't want to miss out on this amazing opportunity. Please help me decide!",

            "comment": "I remember reading that post before I came.  \nSomething like 90% of people get a 2:i or above on this course. Materials has the lowest percentage of people getting a 2:i or first... at about 80-something percent.    \nThe workload of the course was reduced for 2019 entry onwards; 2nd year in particular is less intense, and on average you do one fewer module in 3rd and 4th year.  \nChances are it will not give you psychological disorders and a burning hatred of the senior tutor. I've hardly ever spoken to him. I don't mean to disparage people's experiences, but I think some people on this course do have a  sense of \"grass is greener on the other side\".",

Last term (3rd year) I had labs which added a fuckton of work and I ended up quite behind - to keep up to date with lectures, do problem sheets and the work outside of labs would mean sacrificing most free time. This term was a lot calmer, but then in the holidays I'm in the library 5 hours a day and will probably need to increase that.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI was wondering, for those of you who did IB, what were your IB scores and how close were they to the entry requirements. I can imagine that your scores must be a bit above the entry requirements so that you get an offer, but I\u2019m not sure by how much \n\nI wanna study mathematics, and I meet the entry requirements. How much of a chance would you say I have of receiving an offer?\n\nI have a 42/45 predicted score in the IB with 776 on my HLs. The entry requirements are an overall 39/45 with a 7 on math HL\n\nThanks in advance!",

In mech Eng that is the minimum requirement and as far as I know, most people get that. I know that for other departments they often ask above the minimum requirement, especially if in your interview you don't show anything else but your extremely high grades.",

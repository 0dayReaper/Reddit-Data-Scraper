            "comment": "Hey, \n\nHere is a post I wrote on www.unibudy.com regarding career planning essays for Imperial. Maybe it could help ;) \n\n\"When applying to the MSc Finance, I was faced with an impossible task: explaining my short and long term career goals and how I would achieve them. I\u2019m the kind of person who can\u2019t even plan for the next day, so you can easily imagine that it took me weeks to even start writing a single line, and eventually a couple of months to write something sensible...so here a few steps that I hope will save you some time:\n\n1) Start with the long-term \nStart by picturing yourself at 40. What would you like to be, ideally? If you don\u2019t have an answer to this question, just think about what you are really passionate about and how you can link it with your subject of interest. I was fascinated by tech startups (bid data, IoT, etc.) and wanted to start my own company, eventually. \n\n2) Be honest\nLooking at the profiles of past MSc Finance students, I knew that dreaming of becoming an entrepreneur was highly uncommon. A not so well-advised counsellor even told me I should change everything and focus on trying to fit the typical profile. I didn\u2019t, and nor should you. Only by being really true to yourself will you be able to show passion and dedication in your essays! \n\n3) Work backwards Ok, so my profile didn\u2019t fit, at all! But that\u2019s not a problem, at all. I read dozens of blogs, professional websites and other contents. I soon realised that many top entrepreneurs used to work in Management Consulting and Venture Capital and all was left to do was drawing a logical line between all of this \n\n4) Connect the dots\nI\u2019ll put it short here, since that\u2019s mainly personal. Short term career goal was therefore to work for a leading Consulting firm, this wall the royal path to securing a job in Venture Capital + would give me some key skills to becoming an entrepreneur. Going to Venture Capital after 2-4 years would complete this toolbox by showing me the other side - how to make everything work (KPIs, cash flow optimisation, financing). I would eventually end up starting my own company, should I fail or succeed! \n\nAnd guest what: nothing of that really happened!\" \n",

You won't effect your applications status by asking about it, but it might put your mind at ease. \n\nDon't write a whole essay or make excuses, and certainly don't sound affronted or complaining, just a quick polite email, \"Hoping for an update regards the status of my application\".\n\nBest of luck.",

            "comment": "I did EEE undergrad (some while ago so probably outdated on the specifics) followed by a masters at Cambridge engineering department. Don't think you can make a wrong choice either way.\n\nImperial is far more industry-focused and applied, Cambridge is more theoretical.\n\nImperial is prestigious in tech circles and the prestige is largely limited to Europe/Asia but Cambridge is prestigious in general and well-regarded in the Americas as well. Cambridge has a greater \"wow\" factor. Having said that, Imperial produces far more technical/numerate graduates with in-demand skills and it's easier to find and connect with someone from Imperial working at technical/consulting/banking roles.\n\nI think the biggest difference would be EEE vs General Engineering, what do you see yourself doing? If you know you're going to be an electrical engineer, no point doing civil/mech modules. But if you want more flexibility, or want to go into a non-technical role, it's better to keep options open.\n\nI enjoyed Cambridge's social life more but this may also have been a function of my own adjustment into UK as a foreigner. But I did enjoy the formals, punting and the history/traditions which is quite a unique experience.",

Imperial offers a much more industry related course with more focus on hands-on engineering in comparison to Cambridge are more theoretical.\n\nIf you\u2019re in it just for the degree then I guess Cambridge holds a slightly higher value. But imperials engineering courses id argue are on par with Oxbridge and grads have pretty good employability due to the industry links that Imperial has since its based in London. \n\nI\u2019m a current mech eng student btw so I\u2019m speaking from what ive heard about EEE",

Having an Oxbridge degree opens doors for you in a way that degrees from other institutions simply don't. I'm not defending that, or saying that you can't get to excellent places with degrees from other institutions, *or* that an Oxbridge degree guarantees anything in particular, but on average Oxbridge smooths the path *massively*.\n\nThere are a number of personal influences that only you could possibly answer to, but from my outsider's perspective this is a spectacularly easy choice. Go to Cambridge.",

Imperial is in a league above Durham and St Andrews (it is one of the best universities in the world) and is exactly on par with Oxbridge, especially for engineering and computing where it is considered better. Employers (especially the where I work and in Formula 1) prefer Imperial graduates to Oxbridge graduates. What you have said here is not true at all.\n\nOP, please ignore this person. Imperial is every bit as good as Cambridge, opens the exact same doors and prepares you better for industry",

I attended a string of top-but-not-Oxbridge universities at undergrad, Masters, and PhD level and am doing perfectly well for myself. Siblings and friends who attended Oxbridge, who have similar levels of drive to me, have *consistently* had opportunities opened to them that I did not (from good words put in by contacts in the right places, to successful applications for jobs at firms that are well known behind closed doors to only *really* hire Oxbridge, certainly hugely predominantly). I battled for Post Doctoral positions whereas I know candidates from Oxbridge who were offered positions they didn't even want or apply for. I now work somewhere where I am in a minority (amongst those educated in the UK) for *not* having attended Oxbridge at some point.\n\nAttainment is always going to be mostly a function of one's own drive, as well as luck. But attending Oxbridge puts a nice heavy boot on the scales of that luck. Oxbridge candidates get looked at first an awful lot of the time. A merely good Oxbridge candidate will often out-gun an excellent non-Oxbridge candidate in applications to many firms. I'm not defending it or saying that this goes for everywhere, or even that it isn't changing, but it remains a fact so far as I can tell.\n\nOf course university is about more than just the degree you earn. But I feel it's also pretty disingenuous to pretend that the social scene at different universities differs much, or that attending a better university academically means you sacrifice things socially. My experience on that front has been the complete reverse. OP will have an excellent social life wherever they go, that's what universities do.\n\nAll of this is one man's observations of his journey, family, friends, and colleagues. But phwoar crikey an Oxbridge vs non-Oxbridge decision seems blindingly obvious to me from where I am currently sitting. Oxbridge every single time.",

Imperial is every single bit as respected as Oxford and Cambridge and there will be countless cases where the Imperial graduate is taken over the Oxbridge graduate - especially because Imperial prepares you better for industry.\n\nWhat you have said is not true in the slightest. If an Oxbridge graduate is even slightly worse than an Imperial graduate, then the Imperial graduate will be taken every time. If they are equal, then it will come down to other factors but I would actually say that the Imperial student has an advantage. I have experienced this myself.\n\nHow do you think Imperial has the highest graduate salaries of any university in the UK, or sends such a large proportion of its students to work at top companies like Apple and Microsoft (which both sponsor Imperial's computing/engineering societies)?",

In that sense it's London every day of the week. \n\nIn terms of opportunities, I've felt like I've been very lucky - easily walking into PhD, postdoc, etc and a good network of contacts. I've known people who have and haven't done oxbridge, having both sides of the coin. To me it seems one of those choices 6th formers obsess over, but in reality is so marginal...\n\nI always say - a top name on a CV will get you an interview, from there out it's up to you. I don't know anywhere in engineering that would differentiate between top institutions - I'm sure there's still the odd old-school place that does, but that wouldn't be for me anyway, so personally the point is moot.\n\nBut I do think primarily it's about the person, not the institution. When I'm hiring, I'd rather have a top candidate from Brookes than an average one from Oxford, for instance.",

During the welcome event today, there was just 138 total attendees (and this covered home and international students I believe). Are the majority of applicants really during the Spring? Considering I flopped the AMAT and interview, I doubt I'll get an offer, but I was just curious how the numbers added up. Pondering aside, it was a well done event.",

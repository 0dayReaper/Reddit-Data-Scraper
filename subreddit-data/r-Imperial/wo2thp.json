    "postText": " Hi there, I am an oversea student and have applied for the undergrad accommodation as the first-year student. As per the accommodation website, Imperial College usually provides some early room slots for the overseas who arrive in London early. When can I know whether I'm eligible for this, when can those students move in, and how does it work usually? Thanks a lot!",

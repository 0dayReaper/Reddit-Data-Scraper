    "postText": "Hi, I'm an international student who just got an offer for imperial. I'm a little hesitant about life in London and how classes at the imperial work. I also heard that students have a low satisfaction percentage so I'm a little curious to why that is. \n\n1. Would it be possible for undergrads to take courses outside of their major? \n2. Would there be group projects exam like the states or just one big end of year exam? \n3. Are there sports team?\n4. Do you enjoy life at imperial?",

An insane amount of societies, they have a team for frisbee \ud83d\udc80\n4. Eh. On the whole? Yea. Without the friends I made? Absolutely not.",

            "comment": "1. Yes you can take classes outside of your \"major\". We don't have a major/minor system, but depending on your course you have a certain number of elective modules that you can pick from, usually with options outside your main course. If you really want to do a course that isn't suggested, you can ask the administration and they may allow it.\n\n2. This largely depends on your course, but almost all programs have some degree of coursework and group projects. Mathematics might be around 80/20 exam/coursework (numbers I'm very roughly making up as I'm not in maths but vaguely know), and CS would be around 50/50. Then of course you have your final year projects where you write a dissertation and that is a large part of your grade.\n\n3. Yes there are sports teams, and various societies around activities and hobbies.\n\n4. I'm only here as a postgrad so life is very different for me, and I'm split between two universities with most of my obligations to the other university. So I'm probably not the best gauge for your purposes. From my friends who did their undergrads here it's a bit of a mix bag in terms of enjoyment. My closest friend really enjoyed his time. He made a real effort to keep up with hobbies and socialising. The work load is really tough though and really that's why satisfaction is generally low. I would say that you should try and not let the competitiveness get to you.",

They are optional in the sense that you choose them, but everyone has to select a certain number of modules. This is in contrast to the core modules that everyone taking the course has to take.\n\nThe number of optional modules you are allowed will depend on the course and the year. First years tend to have fewer (and sometimes no) options, and in the last year you have almost full control.",

Interning along with your program also becomes very difficult due to this. That\u2019s a downside but otherwise generally a difficult course is in your favour. Jobs in UK are pretty hard to get right now; the economy is not great and the global recession is not helping either. In such a scenario, Imperial\u2019s rigorous training prepares you well, the college has the best work placements in my program at least. Being an undergraduate though, you will have 4 years compared to the 1 year we get for master\u2019s, this should make life easier for you. Master\u2019s students usually don\u2019t get time to do anything because we only have a year or so to make something out of our careers. Hope this helps! :)",

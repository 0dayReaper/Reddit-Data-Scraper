I used convera per imperial's recommendation, I confirmed with their tracking it was transferred to Imperial already. I haven't gotten any sort of confirmation from Imperial and when I checked my application portal it still says unpaid. I'm hoping since I can \"prove\" it was paid ahead of the March 10 deadline it'll be fine? It is definitely making me a little antsy/anxious though. I just keep reminding myself that it is probably just taking time to process with a lot of deposits coming in at once :)",

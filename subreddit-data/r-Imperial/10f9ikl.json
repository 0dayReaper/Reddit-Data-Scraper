What really helps there is amazing YouTube channels such as \u201cEddie Woo\u201d Professor Dave, and of course \u201c3Blue1Brown\u201d, but of course others as well such as \u201cZach Star\u201d and Dr. Trevor Bazett\u201d. Really taking the time to understand EXACTLY what you\u2019re doing seems to really cut down the number of hours you need to practice. Aside from exam studying, I don\u2019t really practice that much and I consistently score 80+% on mock tests",

    "postText": "I've applied to civ engineering for next year. Today i got invited to this online insight event ( pretty much an open day ) to learn and i guess almost persuade me to join the university. There was this QnA session at the end and I decided to ask about why there are reports of depression at Imperial more than other universities. The host almost seemed a bit annoyed that i asked the question, as if he wished the topic never came up ( I'm basing this purely off the look on his face and his tone of voice so i could be completely wrong lol). Nevertheless, I got an answer back saying that they have good support facilities now and whatever but just something about the responses seemed off. Like they were trying to avoid something. \n\nSo pretty much I came to reddit to ask for genuine answers. I know this stigma about depression at imperial is maybe just a rumour but I'd prefer to know for sure. I'm almost certain that these reports of depression are caused by extreme work load and lack of social life. I'm a very sociable person myself and i'm thinking maybe if the workload is so extreme that i barely get a social life then maybe Imperial isn't for me.",

            "comment": "Hey there Maths students here currently on interruption because COVID just fucks with my mental health.\n\nI had depression before starting university and in my book the support I got from the maths department has been excellent, our undergrad relations officer is literally like a mum and is very approachable.\n\nThe university also has a counselling services, although it takes a bit of time to get weekly appointments after the initial assessment but it did help me at the time (COVID did throw me back in the dumpster tho).\n\nI know when I started in 2017 Physics was apparently pretty bad because thr head of the department didn't care about the workload but he got removed after an abysmal result of the department from the national students survey, so it seems to be better.\n\nSo all in all, yeah mental health is a thing and especially in first year where you won't know many people and have a support network it can take a toll but departments *should* support you and find ways for you to feel at ease.",

            "comment": "Well, a lot of this will be down to your course. In all honesty, I don\u2019t know any civ eng students here at imperial, so I don\u2019t know what your workload would be like, but some of the engineering disciplines I do know people who are studying them seem quite workload heave (mech eng especially from what I\u2019ve seen?).\n\nI\u2019m doing chemistry, and so far our workload has been pretty chill - but I think no small part of that is due to our inability to do labs because of the pandemic, so I really don\u2019t know what things are normally like. \n\nBut, I will say, with the course I\u2019m on and my current workload, I\u2019d have no problems having a great social life. There\u2019s a minor pandemic-shaped wedge stopping that from happening, sadly, but it is what it is.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to the mental health stuff available here, honestly, as I\u2019ve not used it or really looked at it. There has been a lot of \u2018don\u2019t worry about coming to us if you need support\u2019 in everything, but I have no idea about the quality of that support - I\u2019ve heard nothing about it from a student\u2019s perspective. But I also wouldn\u2019t say that people are unusually depressed due to workload and the like - I mean, there\u2019s a bit of a generic downer with, again, the goddamn fucking pandemic, and I also don\u2019t know many people... because, you guessed it, *the fucking pandemic*, but from what I see in the subject group chats and stuff people seem generally upbeat and although people seem to meme about the workload and the like, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crippling.\n\nAgain, this will change hugely both based on your course, and, well, if there\u2019s still a fucking pandemic... haha, so sorry I can\u2019t be too much help.\n\nBut as a final thing to add, I have heard from second years and the like that imperial *does* normally have a really good social scene - apparently people go out a lot and everyone I\u2019ve met here\u2019s been really friendly, and apparently that is the trend (haven\u2019t actually met any assholes here so far and I\u2019ve been here like nearly four months now). And workload and mental health are problems at pretty much all the top unis I think, so I\u2019m not sure how much better other places actually hold up, even it imperial doesn\u2019t do great with it.",

It is openly discussed at welcoming meetings and yearly briefings with the students. Sadly, all universities have problems with mental health among staff and students and it only gets worse in competitive universities like imperial. They have some support in place, not sure how useful\n\n[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/counselling/silvercloud/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/counselling/silvercloud/)\n\n[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/counselling/kind-mind/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/counselling/kind-mind/)",

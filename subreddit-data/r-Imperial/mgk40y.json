Minimum is A\\*A\\*A so it doesn't come as too much of a surprise, but I'm curious as to what offers others got. \n\nAlso, any chance to get it reduced through some kind of program like other unis?",

It is unlikely that you will get a lesser offer than what's on the website, simply because the logic is \"if you're a good candidate, then you should have no problem getting the grades needed.\" \n\nYou probably got a harder offer bc they're trying to lower the amount of people that get into the school bc of Corona. Almost everyone in my year got pretty much the same offer of A *,A *,A (before corona so they didn't make it harder, and we're now a large year-group bc of it)",

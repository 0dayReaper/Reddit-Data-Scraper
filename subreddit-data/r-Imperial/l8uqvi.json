            "comment": "What are the *requirements* listed for the course? They should be very easily available online.\n\nIf it's 'Chemistry A level' then it shouldn't matter\n\nIt it's 'Chemistry A-level and Mathematics A-level' then English as a third is fine\n\nIt it's something like 'Chemistry A-level and two other A-levels in relevant topics', then no, English will not count as relevant. \n\nWe go [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/chemistry-department/chemistry-bsc/#entry-requirements) to view requirements and it says\n\n\"A in Chemistry,\nA in Mathematics,\nA in another subject, (Physics, Biology or Economics is preferred)\nGeneral Studies and Critical Thinking are not accepted.\"\n\nSo that's your answer, English won't discount you but isn't preferred. I suggest that having a non-preferred third puts extra pressure on the two main subjects with regards to considerations, your Chemistry and Mathematics better be top notch. Also you're required to get an A in the third subject *independent of what it is*, there is no \"Oh it's fine if I flunk English because it isn't relevant to the degree\" cop-out available. I'm sure you'll be fine just making sure you understand.",

I want to ask what's a good way besides getting good grades to balance out the playing field per say for example with an EPQ, more extra curricular, reading more broadly about science, is there something that could really boost your application that you've done or know works well?",

Subject specific clubs and societies at school, for example. Do not try and blag something, it should be very clear if you have anything that counts.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that essentially 100% of whether you get in or not is based on grades and interview. And those have to be grades in the right things. I really think that the thing you can do that will by far improve your chances the most right now is switch out English for a preferred subject, so Physics, Biology or Economics. If you stick with English you should be aware that 1) It will raise an eyebrow and make people look at your performance in the relevant subjects even harder, 2) you will very likely be asked in the interview why you did English and not something more useful, so you better have a good reason. 'I like it' is a sub-par reason. Essentially all intelligent people like reading and books and literature, so the counter question is why you didn't intelligently use the time on a more relevant subject and pursue literary goals as a pass time (as most right-thinking people do).",

I did initially do four, physics being forth but I really felt miserable in the class not because of the work or content it was definitely the class and I lost all sort of motivation for the class not the subject. I guess it was weak from me to drop it as I am still interested in physics as a whole but I definitely do see English as a science of language on it's own and I could try to add that as why I chose English. But really thank you for spending the time informing me !",

I did theoretical physics at degree and now PhD level, I like physics, I had a great A-level physics teacher, but A-level physics was still rubbish.\n\np.p.s. Please don't crack out the 'science of language' line in front of anyone interviewing you, they will have to stifle a giggle",

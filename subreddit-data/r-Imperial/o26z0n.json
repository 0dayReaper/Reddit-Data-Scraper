    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nIn an email conversation which the physics admissions team, I asked if having my grades already would benefit me and they mentioned that there would be an entrance exam that I would have to do and that would become part of my application. Does anyone know what this entrance exam is?\n\nUK Applicant and no special circumstances or contextual stuff.\n\nEdit: [this](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/physics-department/physics-msci/#entry-requirements) part under selection process mentions more details will be made available later about the test. Solved I guess. ",

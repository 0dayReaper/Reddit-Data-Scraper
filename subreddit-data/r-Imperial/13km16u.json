    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nI\u2019ve recently received an offer from Imperial\u2019s AI Master\u2019s program.(different from Computing-AI/ML)\n\nI\u2019ve received offers from a few other schools as well, amongst which I\u2019m now contemplating between another reputable AI program in Canada vs. Imperial.\n\nWhile ICL is obviously a great engineering school in the uk/globally, and is one of my top choices, the tuition fee will consume most of my savings. As an international student, a year\u2019s fee is almost 40000\u00a3 and I cannot take up a student loan in my home country since it\u2019s a school abroad.\n\nAnother school in Canada is so to speak less prestigious/has a lower ranking compared to Imperial, but it is fully funded + receive research stipend and also has good reputation in AI research.\n\nDo you think it is worth pursuing ICL over another program in this case? Also if there are students/graduates from this program, I\u2019d like to hear some honest opinions on it as well. \n\nAny opinions will be greatly appreciated!\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f",

I think for most research positions(which is anyways shrinking), it is a  minimum requirement, but how about other roles? \n\nThe job market in N.america is in a pretty bad shape now, does it feel similar over there too?",

There are plenty of smaller companies and startups that are still looking to hire - especially in language modelling startups have received a lot of funding with chatGPT etc blowing up and are looking to hire.\n\nAll of this is anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nEdit: for the Bayesian focus, I think it has to do with significant early breakthroughs being made in the UK (e.g. Gaussian processes) and postdocs and professors that are researching in the UK tend to have studied under Bayesian researchers. Here's an interesting article by one of the main offenders, the machine learning group in Cambridge https://mlg-blog.com/2021/03/31/what-keeps-a-bayesian-awake-at-night-part-1.html",

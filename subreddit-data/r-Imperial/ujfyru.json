It's definitely not as bad as it used to be, the workload is better spread out across the years and on average you do one less module in 3rd and 4th years and there are some more social events. I've found it alright, some people have enjoyed their time here and some have hated it.\n\nI'm assuming you applied to Oxford or Cambridge - it won't be as intense as there.",

I didn\u2019t know they have a separate deadline, plus I applied just before the final deadline, since earlier I had no intention of going abroad but my dad convinced me.\nGood to know though. Honestly, I suppose the massive workload is expected of a really good academic university. I was more worried about the staff not being clear about the grading and assignments marking and all (the statistics showed low satisfaction for this)",

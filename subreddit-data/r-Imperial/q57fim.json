    "postText": "Hi everyone, I want to apply to the BSc Biotechnology degree but want to do so as my 5th option for my primarily medical application.\n\nI have 4 medical choices with none of them being imperial, but want my 5th option to be in this course. Therefore my personal statement has been very medicine heavy, and I talk about my motivation to study medicine above all else. I do also mention my passion for biology and understanding the human body, but want to ask if that would hinder my chances in getting an offer in this course.\n\nMy grades are achieved A*AA in biology chemistry and physics respectively, so I don\u2019t think I should have any issues when it comes to grades. Right?\n\nThanks in advance everyone :)",

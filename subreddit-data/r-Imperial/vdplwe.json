    "postText": "Hey guys, Fall 2022 incoming student (hopefully) here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas wondering what would be your unbiased preferences for accommodation. Please also give reasons (distance, price, community, leisure, etc.) in the comments as to why you prefer a certain hall or dislike a certain hall. Also please don't include Beit hall because I will be under 18 at the time of joining Imperial and can not actually apply for accommodation there.",

Longer commute though.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a pretty personal decision, with a lot of factors unique to each person.",

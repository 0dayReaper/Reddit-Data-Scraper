            "comment": "Hey, I'm an undergrad EU Physics student at Imperial, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.\n\nBy the time you graduate from your Bachelor's, both the US and the UK will be hit hard by the Covid recession. Nonetheless, because there as so many parallels between the two countries (Trump / Boris; isolationism policy / Brexit; etc.) I'm not sure there will be a big difference between the two economies in three years. If you go on to do a Master's / PhD, then by the time you get on the job market, it's so far in time that there is no real way to tell how the economy will have moved.\n\nYou are going to do a degree in Computing, which is probably the most **solid** degree you can get from a university at this point in time. I wouldn't be too afraid of finding work if I were you; there will always be a plethora of job opportunities for you. In both cases though, the degree is going to be hard work. From what I'm gathering about the level of Imperial and UIUC, Imperial is the best of the two unis. The degree is hard work, but with enough grit and perseverance, I'm sure you can pull through.\n\nThe most important question for you now is, **do you want to live in the US, or in the UK**? You will be stuck there for the next 3 to 5 years. The people you will be eating with, partying with, doing sports with, will *mainly* be from the country you're about to study in. Once you get your Master's, you'll have some possibilities of moving to another university in the world for your PhD, if you're considering that.\n\nWhatever you will choose, I'm sure you'll do great. Good luck!",

It might be true that the US as a **country** has more vibrant tech environment and job opportunities but consider where these opportunities are based - I would assume at both west and east coasts but I'm not familiar with Illinois where UIUC is based so I could be wrong.\n\nCompare this to **London**, where Imperial is located, which has a thriving startup scene. The UK (London in particular) is one of the most promising locations for Fintech startups amongst other emerging sectors. \n\nEither way, you might want to consider the location the Universities you're weighing up because finding jobs and opportunities is much easier when you are based near to where they are, rather than having to relocate across a country for internships/placements.",

I obviously doesn't take everything into account -- for instance the mental health services at Imperial could be... improved.\n\nI also know that Imperial has a great location if you want a job that can be found in London. Obviously, you won't find job in fields like forestry, but as a lot of company HQs are in London, you can find close to anything. And I guess that's something UIUC doesn't have (though I don't know much about UIUC).",

I believe tho, without sponsorship, your salary will be way higher than the median and will still be able to prove you are able to work in the UK, but it\u2019s best to gain sponsorship.",

In regards to starting salary, Imperial is one of the best regarded in the UK\u2019s software engineering industry, with many going to FAANGS and big tech companies and I\u2019ve seen so many people above the 55k (pounds, not dollars) meng grad salary average that I doubt why is it so low. i am not sure about UIUC, but then I guess unless you make it to SV you can barely get really well paid swe jobs.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is London is a metropolitan city, with a lot of uk/eu hqs for companies, it\u2019s very easy to go to events hosted by employees if that is one thing that intrigues you\n\nCovid didn\u2019t really affect our third and fourth years that much, third year placement started before summer term near easter so a lot were just wfh at the time as offers are confirmed early, and 90% of the 4th years hold return offers. Brexit won\u2019t really affect you if you are Internationals.\n\nWith regards to PR, presuming you were not the UK prior, you can apply for a ILR after 5 years of non-student visa (work, working holiday, post work study, investment, entrepreneurship, you name it) so in this case doing a BEng would bring you to the fastest route for PR.\n\nPersonally I\u2019ve been studying in the UK prior to uni so I would be going for the 10 year extended stay method.",

    "postText": "I just got a conditional offer from ICL (no interview), it required me to submit my final GPA &gt;= 8/10. I haven't graduate yet, but it'll be likely 7.8/10. I will get the results in the middle of August\n\nI haven't paid the deposit yet. I worry that if I pay and got rejected I might loose it. The deposit deadline is months before my final GPA.\nI've emailed the admission team to ask whether I could get accepted with 7.8 instead of 8.0. They informed that I should send them the transcript as soon as I get it. The course start in October, I'm worry about visa too, but I might make it in time after knowing the final decision.\n\nAnyway, in short, I'm too nervous now. Could you share me your experience about:\n1. What's the chance that'll be accepted?\n2. Any information about paying the deposit for my case? Could I delay it after having the transcript?\n3. Is it possible to defer my offer to next year?\n4. Should I find and apply to another program? Should I pay the deposit even if I apply for another program?\nI haven't found another suitable program for my background outside ICL. So I'm really nervous.",

            "comment": "As much as I have spoken to the admissions team, they did mention that you can defer your offer to up to one year or one intake whichever earlier. So you might want to defer your offer in case you get a higher GPA. In case you get a lower GPA, you might have to anyway look for other unis accepting your GPA",

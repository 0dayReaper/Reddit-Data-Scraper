Would say the degree is really helpful, know a few students from ESB that got excellent job offers in cosulting and banking. But some students who\u2019s taken economics or finance for their undergrad has said the degree is too easy so would suggest checking out if there\u2019s lots of overlap with what you have studied before. The students in ESB are generally really outgoing and fun, they have lots of parties. You can contact the student ambassador on the website, it\u2019s part of their job to answer questions about the program from prospective students or you can contact students on LinkedIn.",

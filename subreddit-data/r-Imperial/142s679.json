    "postText": "I\u2019ll be joining later this year for a maths undergrad and I was just wondering approximately when exams finish (I understand ofc if you can\u2019t give specific dates). I only ask because I\u2019d like to vaguely begin planning some trips after the year ends.\nAnd I know someone at UCL whose exams finished in early May and at Warwick who\u2019s finishing in mid June so I\u2019ve seen that it varies a lot and I\u2019m impatient to know how it is for Imperial.\nAny help is greatly appreciated!",

    "postText": "I want to apply to Imperial but London is a very expensive and big place, I was wondering what the daily commute of a student would be. This is assuming they aren't a millionaire living in central London.\n\nEdit: I mean the commute time after they've moved out of the accommodation. ",

Though at night it's by far my favourite way of travelling.",

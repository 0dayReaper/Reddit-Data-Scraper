    "postText": "I am an Indian international student and I have an offer from Imperial. I am most probably going to accept the offer, but I do have some constraints this year due to covid. \n\nI know it\u2019s a world renowned university. But coming from an insider student, how is life at Imperial? Does it really live up to the hype it gets? How is the dorm life? How\u2019s the overall peer group? Are professors supportive and helpful? \n\nAnswers to these questions would help be decide if paying the international fees is truly worth it or if I can settle for another affordable university. \n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

            "comment": "Hi,\n\nAll I can offer is my narrow perspective. You can live many kinds of lives at Imperial and some are probably amazing and some are probably pretty miserable. To answer your questions specifically:\n- I don't know what hype the life of Imperial has! Imperial's life is stereotypically quieter than most unis, but the abundance of societies to find friends and the size of London makes this pretty irrelevant in the long run. You'd have a different social experience at Manchester, Bristol or Leeds - but it wouldn't necessarily be better. \n- Dorm life - pretty standard and it depends on which halls you get. Beit can get pretty rowdy, Some have a quiter vibe. They're nothing to write home about in my experience, but I enjoyed my time at Wilson. \n- I'm speaking as a white british guy so take this with some mileage, but there's a greater diversity of people at imperial than anywhere else I've been. Imperial is a very welcoming place and you'll be able to find people like you, whoever you are. In my experience, Imperial students have fewer pretentions than the average student at some of the other great unis (oxbridg, durham, etc) - it's a stereotype, but people here are very mixed and very welcoming\n- Professors - mixed bag. Which course are you doing - people will be able to offer specific advice. The ones at Design Engineering are fantastic by and large.\n\nHonestly though, don't rule out your other options. Hope this helps, and happy to answer more questions if you have them :)",

I wanted a relatively quiet social life with a small circle of friends, but I know plenty of people who engaged with societies/events all the time.\n\nThe teaching staff attitude varies by department, I can vouch for Bioengineering.\n\nIn terms of acceptance, while obviously not prejudice/bias free, due to the very large ratio of non UK students, Imperial is quite welcoming for international students. However, as a side effect, since lots of nationalities have multiple students per cohort, national cliques are common to form. This is not necessarily bad, I found it nice to have a community of my own nationality I could rely on.",

The community is fun, vibrant, and it\u2019s easy to make friends even in a pandemic year.\n\nYea, I feel like London in general is very accepting and Imperial in particular is one of the most diverse unis in the UK.\n\nThis really depends on your department but in general they are pretty accommodating and supportive.",

Most locals are often from outside London, so the transition to the university is pretty similar for everyone.  \n\n\nRegarding the comment from u/Vertex_SouthAfrica, \" don't think Imperial is worth the money, especially when u convert pounds into rupees\", I think this can be misleading: all universities in England are costly, it is just that living in London is more expensive than most cities in the UK. However, it is also true that graduating students get top jobs because the diplomas from this university are excellent presentation cards.",

Once uni starts up, old habits will kick in again. I don\u2019t know the statistics, but I think it\u2019s pretty rare for students to drop out first year because of their testing. You\u2019ll get through it :)",

That means if you fail now and fail the resit you cannot progress to the next year.  This doesn't mean they will kick you out though. It likely means you will be given the option to retake the year.  This may set you back but hopefully you would do better in a year wihout this pandemic. \n\nThat being said, the exams aren't there to make you fail. I did not do much revision last year and still managed to pass, albeit not with good grades. But that wont matter for you due to the safety net. If you do well in other years your grades this year will be increased to match them. \n\nIn conclusion, it may seem hard but it is still unlikely you will be kicked. Your grades will be increased to match your future grades if you do well in future.\n\nBest luck with all your exams and I hope you manage to find some peace with all that is going on.",

I read that if I fail more than a single module I won't even be given an option to resit in the summer and will instead be forced  to retake the year, is this true? Thanks for your guidance.",

I assume it to be done on a case by case basis. Don't expect to get resits if you fail more than 3 or 4 modules though. (Remember that any coursework counts as well here. I.e. if you have 35% exam mark but 10% coursework that is a pass).\n\nI don't know what they will do this year though.  I suspect there will be more fails and they may have to reconsider the policy due to exceptional circumstances. The other option which is more likely is that if many people score low, that they will rescale the results and bump everyone up.\n\nIf in doubt, at the moment you should apply for mitigating circumstances. They may just let you defer your exams until September, but then you cannot fail them. Otherwise they may offer another solution or help you prepare so you are ready.",

The university would be challenged strongly by anyone who was kicked off for that. *That being said* subjects build upon themselves, do not kid yourself that you know the topics you should know and need to know, if you actually did then you wouldn't flop the exams, it's as simple as that. So independent of examinations you really need to catch up before the start of new courses.",

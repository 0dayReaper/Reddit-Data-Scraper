    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nUnfortunately I got \u201cunsuccessful\u201d status for my first program of choice, but I\u2019m still waiting for the status of my second program of choice. \n\nI have been waiting for more than two weeks with no change in the status. The only thing that I see is that an additional profile been created but it\u2019s only readable with no action can be taken. My first program turned to \u201csubmitted\u201d status after been marked \u201ccompleted\u201d within couple of days while my second is still at the \u201ccompleted\u201d status.\n\nPlease advice.\n\nBest Regards,",

Im thorough with everything on the sop and I think I'm okay with the physics and math stuff (I'm preparing pat at oxford so that helped quiet a bit). \n\nCan y'all recommend any resources where I can find good questions similar to whatll be asked. Im doing material science engineering.",

E.g. I wrote about graphene and was asked about how it conducts electricity and some questions leading on from that.\n\nI doubt they\u2019ll ask you any hard maths type stuff like is in the PAT (though again everyones interview is different), they\u2019ll probably ask more theory based questions to see if you can understand how a concept works given some information about it and tbh that\u2019s kinda what materials at undergrad mostly is.",

I doubt they\u2019d ask anything super specific.",

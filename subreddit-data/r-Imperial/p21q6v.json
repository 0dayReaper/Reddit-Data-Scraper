    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI'm a student in Australia and I have a couple of questions about entry requirements into Computing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Physics is listed as a \"helpful subject\" for completion. In your experience, do most people who are accepted into computing do physics?\n2. If there is anyone from Australia reading who was accepted into Computing or similar, is VCE Maths Methods acceptable for a subject that requires Further Maths? Or is Specialist Maths required? If you are not from Victoria but from Australia, feel free to comment and I'll tell you the equivalent subjects in your state's system. Additionally, did you complete Physics in your VCE/other studies?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

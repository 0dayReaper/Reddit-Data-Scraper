    "postText": "I am pursuing a 1 year Master's degree full time starting this Fall and was wondering how long I need to set up my housing contract for. On my offer letter it says that the program ends 1 October 2023 but on the Imperial website it says the thesis is due mid September. When do the Master's programs usually end (October 1? September 15?)? Many rentals only rent for 51 weeks so that would take me to beginning/mid September... What do students usually do in this case?",

Regarding this, I've personally set-up my contract starting from 1 Oct 2022 onwards for 51 weeks with GradPad (so it will be a hectic day then). I'm personally hoping the thesis viva for my MRes will end sooner than this, but I'm unsure as well. I'm fortunate to have friends and family members around London however.\n\nJust out of curiosity, what course are you doing?",

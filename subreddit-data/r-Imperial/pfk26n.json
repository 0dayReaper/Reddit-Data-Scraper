    "postText": "Hi! I am keen on applying for the MSc strategic marketing online option. \n\nBackground about me:\n- Coming from a non-traditional academic background: majored in biology in my undergraduate but realized it\u2019s not for me after graduating. Successfully changed career to marketing by doing a 1-year post-graduate marketing program (non-degree).\n- GPA from my undergraduate was really low due to the major; my GPA from 1-year marketing program was very good (90% avg)\n- Three years of working experience in Canada on the media agency-side(worked on iconic brands like Tim Hortons and HSBC); strong recommendations from senior leadership and client \n\nI understand that Imperial puts a strong emphasis on GPA. However, given my non-traditional background, wonder if I stand a chance for the online option (don\u2019t want to put my career on hold).",

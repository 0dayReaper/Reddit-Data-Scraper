    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am a year 13 student in the UK doing maths, physics and DT A levels. I have applied to Imperial College London (design engineering) without putting deffered entry on UCAS, however, I will need to take a gap year since currently, I qualify as an international student, but after my gap year I would be a home student. Does anyone know if the university would accept this?",

I heard back that it was approved a couple of days after sending the form so the process was quick (although I heard it may take longer).\n\nOne year of deferral is only allowed.",

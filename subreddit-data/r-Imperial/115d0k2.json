            "comment": "Stats student here, your question is very vague but i\u2019ll try to interpret it: my take is that as far as 1 year masters go, it is very much worth it. The work load is extremely high tho (especially in comp to friends studying other msc courses), so don\u2019t expect to be doing much other than studying. I think it is worth it in the sense that even though it is only a one year masters, you still learn a lot. But if you have the option and if that is a priority, study the same at a uni offering 2 year masters, since you surely will learn the theory in greater depth. \nAlso note that admission is very competitive; for this year\u2019s cohort there were over 1600 applications for merely 50 places.",

My coursemates who have applied for phds hve so far been v successful judging by their admission rates; but that says more sth about themselves than about the course I think. Tbh i don\u2019t think a 1 year masters is going to \u201chelp\u201d you that much in the sense that it\u2019ll transform your level of employability. It probs polishes your rough edges a bit, but it won\u2019t make a diamond out of coal, metaphorically speaking. But it\u2019s always hard to say when you\u2019re in the eye of the storm",

    "postText": "So I have two options for my accommodation during my year at Imperial - The first one being I book an accommodation near South Ken or areas nearby but pay a hefty rent. OR, the second one - I stay the year with a relative who lives in Slough where I'd be saving up a lot on accommodation.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best option for me? \n\nPS - The closest route I checked for Imperial from Slough is about 45 mins apart. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nFollowing are the points of concern -\n1. Cost of living\n2. Time taken to reach Imperial from my accomodation.\n3. Part time job opportunities while staying in Slough and staying in London.\n4. The weather.\n5. Accessibility to social life.",

Living near campus isn\u2019t that expensive if you look well and share. Idk, I guess it all ends up being a personal preference, but social life, commute time and networking are quite important to me",

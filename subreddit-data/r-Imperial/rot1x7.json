I do physics which is unusual in that almost every exam is in the summer term, but even those are spread out - some at the end of April, some in May, or the middle of June. Other courses might have mid-term exams earlier in the year, or at the end of the first term. But the majority are in the summer.\n\nBecause of timetabling and having to book spaces, it is inevitable that the exams are spread out.",

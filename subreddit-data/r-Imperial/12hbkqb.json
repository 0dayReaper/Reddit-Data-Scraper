    "postText": "Hi we have an elderly relative in Whitton and has a small room she is looking to rent out, she will offer breakfast and dinner ..there are regular buses going to whitton train or hounslow east station \u2026the rent will be really low,  \u00a3400 ( bills and food included)  a month as she is looking for one hour help a day ( admin and just helping in house) and two hours at the weekend and a pre arranged convenient time. The house is lovely, the room is a small box room. If you\u2019re interested let us know. This is super convenient for international students as it\u2019s 15 mins from Heathrow and all items can be stored over the summer or holiday periods. If you\u2019re looking to party this isn\u2019t the accommodation for you but if you\u2019re looking to live in a beautiful house and not worry about heating, food, hot water and be in fully alarmed accomodation and don\u2019t mind helping out please do get in touch. References are essential.",

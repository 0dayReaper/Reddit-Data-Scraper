    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI\u2019m a current year 13 student, and I\u2019m wanting to study electrical and electronic engineering next year at university. I\u2019ve been looking at imperial a lot, and the course looks really good, uni obviously has a great reputation and ranking, but I\u2019m slightly worried I\u2019ll be miserable when I\u2019m there; can anyone who is there or has been let me know whether imperial being full of unfriendly people who study all the time is true, or whether it is a myth and it has in fact got  lots of normal friendly people? how has your experience been making friends etc? Thanks!",

You'll meet some students at Imperial who're only focused on their work, but you'll find that at most top universities too. What you'll find more of, indeed far more of, are those people who want to finish with a good degree whilst also enjoying their time.\n\nA couple of my old flatmates were Imperial EEE. They were the life and soul of our house parties. \n\nDon't believe the myth.",

It has loads of clubs and societies too so no matter what your interests are, you should meet likeminded people.",

Haha, covid will probably make it a lot harder, sadly, but I want to meet new people and have a good time, and most of the people I\u2019ve spoken to seem pretty like minded.\n\nBesides that, you\u2019d be living in london. Like, from what I understand there are student events, offers, etc throughout the city, regardless of what uni you\u2019re at, and I\u2019ve heard mention that you can go to other unis\u2019 student union bars, which might have more your vibe if you wanted, idk, not arrived yet! But there\u2019s always gonna be loads to do in london, I hope at least haha \ud83d\ude03",

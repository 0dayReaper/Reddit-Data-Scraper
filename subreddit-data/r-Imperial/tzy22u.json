    "postText": "Hi everyone. I am going into university next year, and as scummy as it sounds, I want to do management consulting after an engineering degree, hopefully in one of the big 3 (McKinsey, Boston and Bain). I have gathered some opinions regarding this from HR people but believe that your varied points of view and personal experiences will allow for a more comprehensive review of the options I present. So, in your opinions as students (or not), which university and degree in each would give me a better chance of having a shot at those firms- Chem Eng at UCL or MSE at Imperial? I accept that your views will be biased as I am asking around on an Imperial College reddit but I would appreciate objectivity. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. I am equally passionate about both after looking at the modules and taking taster-courses",

It's supposed to one of the best in the world...",

It\u2019s the only 6 predicted I had, the rest were 7\u2019s.",

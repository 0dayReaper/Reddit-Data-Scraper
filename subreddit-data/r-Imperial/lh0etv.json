    "postText": "So I received an interview offer for ChemE an hour back. Quick question-It's on the 17th of this month and I have another event clashing that day. So if I ask them to postpone it to 2 weeks later, am I screwed by any chance?\n\nAlso in case, they don't let me do that can u guys share some tips to prepare for the interview?",

Tell them frankly that it's not the best date for you, and are there possibilities for a later interview (and would they disadvantage you) - and depending on the answer, make your choice. \n\nI don't do Chem Eng so I can't comment on the interview. But good luck :)",

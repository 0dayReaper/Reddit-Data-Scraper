    "postText": "I am a conditional offer holder for Aeronautical Engineering. My offer is 4A\\*'s (Further Maths, Maths, Physics and Chemistry)\n\nI don't mean to sound ungrateful here, I am of course extremely thankful and appreciative for the offer.\n\nEveryone  I have talked to has an ALL A\\* conditional offer despite the offers for the last 3 years being 2A\\*s and 2A (most the time). It should be noted that I had the highest entrance test score in my school and my interview went (in my opinion) relatively well. 4A\\* offers are unheard of unless I am severely misinformed.\n\nIs this the case with everyone one else who received for aerospace engineering?",

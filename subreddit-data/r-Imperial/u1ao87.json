Should I try contacting the department directly or email the admissions tutor and personally ask him about that?  \nThank you for any advice.",

Imperial has tonnes of Bursary/Support funding so please don't fret if things have gone tits up for you.\n\nFirst point of contract if you are an existing student is the Senior Tutor of your department, let them know the situation and they'll tell you what to do from there.",

Depending on if you are a home student or international and your household income you will be elegible for different grants, bursaries or loans so student funding will be the best port of call. I've usually got a reply withing 7 days so it's odd it's taken so long.",

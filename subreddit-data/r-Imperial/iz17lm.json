However, after 3 years in the office and 6 months from home I can tell you with confidence that your productivity will improve with a second monitor. Useful to have one screen for the document/code/modelling you're working on and another for intructions/research/etc. Prioritize size over resolution. I've used a tablet as a second monitor when travelling, but much prefer the big monitor set up at home.",

It's fine to have and I like it but I'm not too fussed about getting an extra monitor for my laptop. If you find a cheap one sure, you shouldnt really care about graphics or resolution, you're not going to be doing Photoshop, just get a cheap screen",

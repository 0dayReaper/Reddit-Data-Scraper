If so, would you accept to have a quick chat with me?  \nI just got a conditional acceptance offer, and I  am very happy, but I can't find any information other than the name of the offered lectures. I am particularly interested in the theoretical aspects of Artificial Intelligence, so I am really looking forward to a program with as much math as possible.  \n(Also I got accepted without an interview, is that normal?)\n\nWish you all the best!",

I would think that the main difference is the amount of computing background expected and the degree flexibility - AI assumes that you know none, while Advanced Computing assumes an undergraduate CS degree or similar. There's also the specialism in AI and ML which you may want to check out.",

Note that the exams are after each of the two teaching terms, and not in the summer term as some others may have experienced.",

You can indeed tailor Advanced Computing to be (almost) the same as a specialist degree if you wanted to.\n\nThe specialism require you to take a certain proportion of your degree from broadly AI/ML-based modules, and hence has less overall flexibility than Advanced Computing. Personally, the flexibility that Advanced Computing provided was a significant benefit for me, since I wanted to take modules across different domains and that would be harder with the specialism. Also, for the specialism, your project must be based on the relevant field (so AI/ML in your case).\n\nAnother thing worth noting is that the specialism technically assumes slightly less of a CS background than Advanced Computing, and hence there is slightly better access to third-year modules than Advanced Computing. For example, Advanced Computing students cannot take the third-year Robotics or Operations Research modules which the AI/ML specialism students can.",

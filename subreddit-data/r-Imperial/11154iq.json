            "comment": "Tbh, that depends per course, and the same applied for ML and AI course at imperial. I would just come a week or two early before the official start date just so you get to know the city and where things are located and stuff (like local supermarkets to your accom and other essential places), just so you get used to it before the course starts so you don\u2019t get all overwhelmed then(assuming of course that you have accommodation booked so that you can check right in). \n\nWhen it comes to finishing, now that really depends per course. Usually though, we tend to finish much earlier than our official date, so there\u2019s that. I can\u2019t say the exact date, since we still have no idea when our exams and stuff are, and some people also extend their thesis time so they have more time, prolonging their studies completion time further.",

All private accomodations also differ in how long they will let you stay. There are some private accoms where you can book for a fixed number of months and stuff. Hopes that answers your question.",

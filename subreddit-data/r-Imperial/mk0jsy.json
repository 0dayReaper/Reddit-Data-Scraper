I have no preference for a specific country.\n\nThank you",

A masters at Imperial is one of the best computer science educations in the world and will prepare you a lot better than Columbia would. Imperial is one of the most respected names in the *world* in academia and would be a great place to do a PhD",

Nothing special about it not even in the UK.\nThe fact is that OP has the chance to taste an Ivy League (Columbia, not Cornell btw) and that is a much more valuable experience than Imperial. It is also much higher regarded internarionally, as opposed to Imperial's UK only recognition (I agree with that, Imperial is great for UK's standard)",

You get a technical education at Imperial far better than most other places, especially Columbia. Imperial students learn significantly more in depth computer science than Columbia students. It is much much better than a lower tier Ivy League education.\n\nI also don\u2019t think Columbia is higher regarded internationally than Imperial. Sure in the US it is, but in the US Columbia is regarded higher than any UK uni. Imperial\u2019s reputation is bigger in Europe and especially Asia. It has the best CS course in the UK. In academia worldwide Imperial is especially well known - MIT regard it on the same level as them\n\nHow do you think so many brilliant Imperial students go on to work at Apple and Google and all the best tech companies around the world?",

I would have agreed with some of your points if you weren't trying so hard to sell imperial. I don't know which year you are in but considering I am in my final CS year, I am most likely more senior than you, hence more experience.  \nYes Imperial is very technical and yes that's good and if it's your goal then Imperial might be for you. However, Imperial is not the best CS university in the UK and I think this is obvious, since Cambridge exists. There are cases to be made both for and against Imperial, but this argument is very largely influenced by the fact that you are so passionately defending Imperial due to your high dosage of cope. I guess you have some way to go and it's due to you being young.",

That is completely false and needs a strong response as no-one else thinks like this.\n\nImperial is at least as good as Cambridge CS and prepares you better for industry and I think that is obvious. What you have said there is not true. The course has changed a lot in the last few years and it is rightly considered at the top\n\nThere are of course cases to be made for and against Imperial, but trying to downplay the university is just nonsense.

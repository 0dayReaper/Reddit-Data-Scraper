My conclusion is that most people will be fine anywhere.\n\nThe only thing is that in terms of clubbing, Acton is a massive pain because its almost an hour from all the central london clubs that LSE, UCL and kings go to as well.",

But I knew people in Eastside/Southside who liked being so close, and the quad bar was nice for a quieter pint. Beit obviously has the union on the doorstep. Wilson was great for night busses home after lots of the nights out in typical bars around there (Roxy, Zoo Bar, Tiger Picadilly etc), but thats true of most places to be honest.",

            "comment": "I don't know the exact numbers for each hall but I can give a reasonable idea. I stayed in Woodward &amp; there were 8 rooms to the kitchen (my flat happened to have a twin room so 9 people but it would normally be 7 or 8 per kitchen). \n\nThe rest I only know from visits and are estimates, I can also speak a little on kitchen size, though I have only visited one kitchen from each:\n\nCostume Store: 6-7 smaller than Woodward, not by much.\n\nSouthside (I imagine Eastside would be similar): 6-7 significantly smaller than Woodward, verging on cramped imo.\n\nBeit: 6-7 similar to Costume Store (if a little smaller) and spacious enough.\n\nWilson: ~20, huge kitchen, 2 tables with benches, could probably seat 10ish\n\nParsons House: 6ish though never been in one\n\nWoodward had the largest of the kitchens from the above halls (with the exception of Wilson). And of course Woodward has the D-Block kitchens that you see on the website which are super nice (Blocks B&amp;C have plain rectangular kitchens with no fancy floor to ceiling glass). Also, and this could just be because of the kitchens I visited, Woodward had 2 sets of hobs and 2 ovens where I didn't see this in any other kitchen apart from Wilson.\n\nI can't speak for the other halls as I haven't visited them but you can expect 6-7. I would imagine (just guessing though) that Kemp Porter will be similar to Woodward, I could be wrong though.",

            "comment": "Well, it varies a lot, as has been said! \n\nI\u2019m in Kemp Porter, one of the halls my fellow commenter here is unfamiliar with.\n\nAnd... even in kemp porter, we have three, maybe four, sizes! \n\nMy flat has room for 12 people, but two of those are twin rooms, that due to the pandemic are single occupancy - which may well say true next year - and so the maximum total is 10 currently.\n\nThe other \u2018set\u2019 of flats in my \u2018block\u2019 (there are two blocks, and a flat 1 and a flat 2 on every floor in each block) has a few fewer than mine. I\u2019m not sure exactly how many, but I think 8(?) max, maybe.\n\nThe other block has fewer again I think, with I THINK, it being about six? I\u2019ve only been over there once though and didn\u2019t count the cabinets lol, so not too sure. There are also 2 flats per floor in B block, so the other flat in B block might be a different size too!\n\nWhat I will say in KP, the kitchen size is proportional to how many people there are. In my up to 12 person flat we have a big, open plan kitchen/common room area. That area gets much smaller as you shrink the flat, and you get less work surface and storage too. So it works out pretty well imo! Haha",

It is a nice cool down from uni, a change of pace, potentially s nice walk through Hyde part and a chance to socialise with people from your flat or any other from north Acton.\n\nThat being said, it's 45 mins each way which is quite a chunk of time lost, any trip to central London will be an extra trek, so going out with south ken people is a bit hard. Also as a final note, first year lecturers can tell where all of us lived from our Christmas exams grades. It is very easy to just say fuck it if you wake up late, and miss an entire day of uni since you can just rewatch the lectures online. It's not that big of a problem, especially in finals, but you will miss more morning lectures because of the trek.",

It does take roughly 45 mins to an hour, really (depends on how good the connecting tube timing is, or if you choose to walk through hyde park) - but it\u2019s not too bad. It means getting up like half seven, which you\u2019re probably used to as is being in sixth form (well, when you go in person, anyway! Haha) so it\u2019s not awful.\n\nAnd, honestly, \u00a370-100 a week is a pretty decent incentive to get up an hour earlier... haha\n\nAlso, the accommodation, at least in Kemp Porter, is really, really nice. I think woodward is quite nice too - but they\u2019re high quality, and *new*. Also the wifi is amazing, some of my coursemates in other accommodations can hardly talk in Teams meetings! Haha.\n\nAs with all things, there\u2019s upsides and downsides, and you have to decide which ones are more important for you personally!",

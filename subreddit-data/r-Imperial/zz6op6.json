    "postText": "I am aware that the 1st round application has passed but I was busy and didn't bother to apply just yet. I wonder if y'all could roughly estimate my chances if I apply around January.\n\n**Stats**\n\n* Asian male studying a 3 year Bachelor of Engineering (mechanical) degree at UCL (now year 3)\n* 1st class honours\n* Awards:\n   * Highest grade avg (ranked 1st out of 250) in year group.\n   * Highest grade avg in all programmes (BEng, MEng, MS) and year groups in the ME department.\n* Publications: one published (1st author), two in preparation (1st and 2nd author with renowned academics on the author list)\n* GRE: 162/167 + 5.0\n* Research: 3 long (3 month +) research experiences in relevant specialization (nanotech) plus an ongoing undergrad thesis.\n* Recommendation: 2 from full professor + 1 from assistant prof. One letter from full professor is very strong where the recommender said he/she wanted to keep me as his/her PhD student.\n* Very rich extracurricular activities in sports and non sports (with many national awards). Few community services.\n\n**THANKS!!**",

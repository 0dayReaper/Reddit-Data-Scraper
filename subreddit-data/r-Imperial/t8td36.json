    "postText": "Hello, I finished my A-levels on the Summer of 2021 and decided to take a gap year for personal reasons. \nI'm applying for MEng Materials Science and Engineering, and my interview will be this Wednesday. I was informed by them that they will test me on my critical-thinking skills and the question will be about either maths, physics or engineering. So because I've left academics for a while now, how scared should I be for the question? Do I need to do some studying? (Although they did tell me that I don't need to any 'studying' for the interview). Should I be an absolute madlad and just wing it?",

(I was forced to defer for some reasons). \n\nI'd say you don't need a lot of preparation for the interview because they ask the questions to test your reasoning and analytical capabilities, not necessarily to get the right answer. It would help boost your confidence to prepare though as it would make you feel more ready to answer their questions. \n\nAlso don't forget to reread your personal statement as the interviewer will likely ask you questions based on it so as to understand you more. \n\nAnyways Best of Luck and hopefully you ace it and get an offer.",

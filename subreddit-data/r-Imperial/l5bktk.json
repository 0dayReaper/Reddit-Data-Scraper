I thought of showing the development and result of a craft pattern I designed, but I don't know if that's scientific enough (especially after hearing about someone who built an RC robot for their interview...). Would it be best to just say I don't have anything?\n\nIf anyone has any tips or experience, it'd be greatly appreciated.",

Practice answering them in about 8 minutes, and talk while you do them:\n\n1) approximately how many hairs are on your head?\n\n2) find the equation of a parabola give 3 points\n\n3) estimate how many pizzas are delivered every week in London?\n\nDesign challenge:\nSpend about 10 minutes sketching and coming up with an idea, then practice spending about 6 minutes pitching it to someone. This will not be your challenge (it's the same every year) but here's a good practice problem:\n\nDesign a washing machine that is made for someone who is visually impaired. Take into consideration usability and safety",

(I'm a bit worried as it's online as well this year) I'm not too sure how to get better at the \"estimation\" questions as well - I wouldn't really know how to approach the 1st or 3rd one. (for the 1st one I'd probably just get as far as thinking of how many hair are on a certain area then scaling that up and maybe for the third considering how many pizzas each person orders a week then scaling it up to london's population? this seems like a pretty weak way to do it) Any advice?",

            "comment": "Hello, current design engineer student here. That sounds like a great project to showcase some of your creativity and craftspersonship - you don\u2019t need to have a technical background to do this course. Bring what you have and be prepared to relate it to design engineering, but remember you may not have time - we never talked about the work I brought. The best advice I can give is to go through the basic interview questions and come up with some answers, especially with regards to your motivation - think about WHY you want this and be prepared to articulate it. I was asked to talk about some design I found interesting, and I was able to talk about a project I\u2019d been reading up on in preparation for the interview. Lastly, try and be as flexible of thinking as possible - it\u2019s hard to prepare for that, but you\u2019ll likely be asked questions which will try and get you to demonstrate if you can think on your feet, so just be calm and be willing to take some time to think things through and explain the steps As you go.\n\nAll the best :)\n\nEdit: don\u2019t worry about the other candidates doing things like building RC cars. Some people come to DesEng with all the technical skills in the world and fall down when they can\u2019t string their skills together and integrate them with a design mindset. Some people come in from art backgrounds and excelling. Whatever your base of experience is, tell the interviewer why it links to what you want to do!",

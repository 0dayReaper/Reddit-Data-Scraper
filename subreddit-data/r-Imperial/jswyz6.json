    "postText": "I recently got to the second stage of the aeronautical entrance process, the interview. Does anyone have any advice? What\u2019s it like? Is it based on my personal statement or content based questions? Any information would be appreciated for the aeronautical engineering interview or general engineering interviews.",

I just thought out loud and make sure he understood the way I was approaching the problems. He would give me hints in between and we\u2019d arrive at the final answer together, which was really rewarding.",

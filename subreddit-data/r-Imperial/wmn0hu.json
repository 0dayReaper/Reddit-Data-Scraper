Courses are engaging, most teachers are knowledgeable and friendly, my department (physics) has a pretty welcoming atmosphere. London is a great city to live in if you can afford it, and societies are wide-ranging and well-kept for the most part.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by tools, it will vary by your course. For me, a proper laptop is more useful than an iPad, allows you to run software that might only be available on windows and I prefer to take notes on paper anyway. Worth noting that the computing facilities can be kind of irritating, especially if you're used to a certain workflow.\n\nHope this helps!",

I always have my notes with me now even from first year. I think it is a worthwhile investment but by no means necessary.",

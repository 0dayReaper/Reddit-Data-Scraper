    "postText": "Hey guys, I just got a mail from Imperial 2 days ago stating that I'll have to take some Pre-Interview test today and apparently, they mention that no preparation is required. I have read and went through many threads and I just have few questions unanswered.\n\nFirstly, after you all took the test, was there anything that made you think that , if you had studied that before the test , you would've scored better.\n\nSecondly, what are the topics/concepts that I MUST revise before test and are most likely to come.\n\nAND ALSO PLZ TELL ME WHAT SHUD I REVISE FOR COMPUTER, CUZ I REALLY DONT KNOW HOW GCSE/A LEVEL TEST CODING KNOWLEDGE.\n\n(btw i am an international students so it would be huge help if you could mention the topics/concepts instead of  \"its just A-Level/GCSE math \")",

            "comment": "I've already done the test last Friday, but it seems that everyone is getting different questions, or the questions are from a randomised list. \n\nThere weren't any questions that made me think that I should have revise better, because the questions were generally quite logical, or they relied on A-level maths knowledge. So what I think would help you the most is if you do a past paper for A-level pure maths, or a difficult practice paper you can find somewhere online. You'll see enough topics in there. There are no MUST topics to revise, as I have no idea what questions will come up for you. As long as you've been doing well at maths wherever your from, I imagine you'll do fine.\n\nYou don't need any prior programming or computing experience, so don't bother learning \"coding knowledge\".\n\nAnother thing they really care about is your logical thinking, but I don't think that's something you can train that much, but maybe practice some MAT computing questions. [https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test/mat-past-papers](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/undergraduate-study/maths-admissions-test/mat-past-papers). They are usually the last two questions. Don't worry if you can't finish the questions on your own, but at least give it a try and look at the solutions, maybe you'll learn something. If you're not passionate about learning more and developing your logical thinking, maybe Imperial isn't the place for you, so don't be too annoyed if you don't get in. \n\nThe admissions process is to make sure that they'll be happy having you, but also that you won't be wasting your time there.",

Though OP has probably already taken the test, leaving my thoughts here for other readers.\n\nFirst, on the topic of coding, rest assured \\~50% of each first year cohort have no prior programming experience. Not having done programming before is fine -- it's why you come to university!\n\nMuch has changed in terms of admissions since I joined, but the basis of admissions tests remains the same: to test mathematical and logical thinking to filter out weaker applicants. These tests do not reflect the actual course, but instead test your maths/logic skills.\n\nTo prepare for the test, I'd look at /u/leafypath33's top-level comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Imperial/comments/jp34qo/pre_interview_computing_admissions_test_for_the/gbd4yqt/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Preparing by looking at MAT questions sounds very reasonable: it will get you into the right mindset for when you take the exam, even if the questions may be in a slightly different format.",

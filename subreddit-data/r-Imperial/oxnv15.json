    "postText": "Hi, I am going to come to Imperial to study chemistry in the fall. \nI need to buy a laptop as mine is old. Currently at a local hardware place there is a discount on macs but my friends tell me that I can have difficulty running older programs that might be in use at unis as they may not be compatible with the new M1 chip? \nAny chem students with macs especially I would appreciate advice on how much tech was interwoven into your course and any difficulty you had if any with comparability or ease of use of tech.",

You used to get a pretty sweet discount on apple products as a student though so might want to see if its worth waiting anyway.\n\nYou should be able to email and ask what software you're expected to use to confirm if it works on macs though.",

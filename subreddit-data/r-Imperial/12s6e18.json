    "postText": "Ayo\n\nI'm a graduate school student moving to London from the US. Accommodation is difficult to find so I am going to stay at Gradpad which is loosely connected to Imperial College London. When I try to submit the deposit for my room, I am taken to a screen that reads: \"We are unable to complete your request at this time. Please try again later or contact property manager.\"\n\nI called. I emailed. Nothin.\n\nI hope I'm not the only one in this predicament. If you are, or have made it to the next level, SOS.",

Also incoming international graduate and Gradpad doesn\u2019t seem worth at all considering it\u2019s not close to campus and you\u2019re paying a premium. There\u2019s like tons of (private) student accommodation that are cheaper and closer",

    "postText": "I received a conditional offer from Imperial and UCL for the MSc computing programs. I was wondering which program you guys think is better? How is the student/social life at Imperial? What do the job opportunities look like? How much should I prepare for the program as someone with little computer science background?",

            "comment": "Imperial is definitely the more prestigeous one. \n\nAs for social life... well it has a reputation for a reason. It's a combination of most people who go being huge nerds and international students and the campus being set in an area of london that isn't exactly alive with nightlift. That said, social life at uni is always and only what you make of it. It's always possible to find communities that work for you, even if you have to look a little harder than you might elsewhere. \n\nJob opportunities are extremely good. In fact, Computing at Imperial may well have the best graduate employment outcomes that there are, and certainly does if you exclude oxbridge. \n\nAs for how much prep you need to do? I'd say probably practice your programming and your maths. If you get the grades to meet your offer and you can handle the workload, the content will probably be fine, but reading around the subject and practing your fundamental skills will always help. \n\nAll that said, UCL is an extremely good uni too (even if I think we're supposed to be rivals), and although not perhaps as highly considered as Imperial, it is still very well regarded and acadmically strong.",

I'm not very informed about computing at Imperial but it was told at EEE offer holders day, they gonna slowly teach you about programming and you don't have to be familiarized at all. However it will certainly beneficial to look at basics before you go.",

Social life at imperial was the major downside but from what I have heard, it largely depends on the halls you stay in. Beit has a good reputation as it has the student union close to it. Plus I will have a current classmate at LSE, and a senior at Kings, so if the worst situation arises I can hang out with them.",

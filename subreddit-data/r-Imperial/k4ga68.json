E.g. if your not taking AP stats they won't ask you for a 5 in Stats. \n\nSee the course information page for more info, I'll say it's very rare to be asked for 5 grades, normally 3 more common. And 4 is a bit much.  \n\nNote that four a course at IC they'll be asking for three or four 5's, 2x4 and 2x5 wont fly so don't bite off more than you can chew!",

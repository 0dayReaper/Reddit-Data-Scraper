I've heard that it is generally male heavy though it does vary from course to course. What's your favourite thing about studying Geology at Imperial?",

Our lecturers are pretty passionate about what they're teaching, which is quite different to what I hear about other institutions. Any more Q's feel free to DM me.",

I've read online that Imperial tends to incorporate quite a lot of O&amp;G examples and stuff into their course as it's one of the key areas they specialise in etc, is this correct? Also, I'm still pondering on whether to do the BSc and do a separate masters or the integrated MSci. I deffo don't want to go into research at the end and I've read that doing the BSc + MSc is better for industry. Which course are you doing/do you know any information regarding this? Also, what's the typical week like like as a geology student at imperial?",

However plenty of people doing MSci go into the big oil grad schemes, you would need an internship, petroleum  geology oriented modules, and a related MSci under your belt though.\n\nI wouldn't advice getting into it at all to be honest, it's an industry heading only one way, and \"petroleum exploration\" is probably nowhere near as exciting as you think it is.",

A handful from my year ended up in the industry. As a whole I'd probably say only a 3rd of the year ended up in geo-related industries (although a good chunk more stayed in academia).",

I wouldn't pin your hopes on it however if you are a top student it should be within reach. The majority of year abroad students go to other countries.",

Honestly, even if you\u2019re an absolute star student now there\u2019s still a vey low chance that you can beat almost every other mech eng student. This is Imperial, everyone is a star student and smart as shit lol",

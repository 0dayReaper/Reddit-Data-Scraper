I have Taotronics soundliberty Bluetooth in ears for my dailies and they have amazing sound for their worth, plus I am not comfortable with most earphones but those are good for hours (yes I watch dankpods how could you tell)\n\nI got some 130\u00a3 Sennheiser ie80s and they turned out to be dogshite. No balance and really uncomfortable. Also have some monster ncredible ntune or sth like that and I really like those but they are also uncomfortable after a bit. My flatmate also left me some beats studio 2s wired and they are just beats but they have a mute button which is arguably the best feature I have ever seen on headphones.\n\nAnd I use Spotify because fuck tidal.",

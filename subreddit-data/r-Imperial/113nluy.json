            "comment": "I did my undergrad at Imperial and am now doing a PhD in Cam. I have carried out some supervisions for undergrads in Cam so I think I also know about the undergrad chem eng curriculum in Cam. I feel like the chem eng degree in Cam is not as \"chem eng\" as the one at Imperial. The one at Imperial has a massive emphasis on the actual industrial process; they even have a carbon capture pilot plant at the middle of the building. If you want to work as a chemical engineer after you graduate, I believe Imperial is the better place to go.\n\nSports-wise, I think it might be easier to join a sport at Cam, especially rowing which is arguably the most important Oxbridge sport. In London, you'll have to travel rather far to get on a river. However, Imperial does have good rowing facilities and have beaten Cam in some recent races.",

    "postText": "I just got my interview for molecular bioengineering, any advice on how to prepare? \n\nThe details on the website seem to be for biomedical engineering. Like will they ask academic questions to test your ability? If they do, is it about math and chemistry or are there physics or biology questions? I was wondering because physics and biology are related to the course but are not prerequisites. \n\nOr is it more about your interest in the course (personal statement)?",

The caveat here is that it was a while ago (2003-04) but it might be of use to you?\n\nI don't have the recommended reading list for any of the courses, I'm sorry.\n\nM1M1: Mathematical methods 1, resetting your knowledge of basics in mathematics\n\nM1M2: Mathematical methods 2, ODEs, PDEs etc\n\nM1GLA: Geometry and linear algebra\n\nM1F: Foundations of analysis\n\nM1S: Statistics\n\nM1P1: Pure mathematics 1, limits and sequences mainly\n\nM1P2: Pure mathematics 2\n\nM1A1: Applied mathematics 1\n\nM1Comp: Computational mathematics and algorithms with Matlab\n\nIn addition to that we did a 2-3 week solo project at the end of the summer term, just after the exams had finished but before we broke up for the summer break. That was generally a short essay on a topic in your chosen field of study. I remember writing something about Kepler's laws for the orbits of comets.",

Do try to find a recommended reading list from a current Imperial student, though - my list of courses is almost 20 years old and I can't give more details than the broad subject areas, really. Getting hold of better details with a current first year student would be ideal if you can.\n\nGood luck for your gap year!",

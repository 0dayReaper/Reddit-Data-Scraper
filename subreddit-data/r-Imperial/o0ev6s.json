    "postText": "Hi all,\n\n26M from Singapore here, will be beginning my postgrad studies at Imperial in Jan 2022 at the Department of Chemical Engineering.\n\nWould welcome any advice on things to take note of for a postgrad student who is studying/living in London for the first time.\n\nLooking to connect with any Singaporeans heading to or at Imperial as well as other Chemical Engineering students.\n\nI am also looking for people to share accommodation (nearby to the South Kensington campus) with from Jan '22 onwards.\n\nDo reply or DM me if you would like to link up, thanks!",

            "comment": "I have a MSc admit in Business Analytics at Imperial as well. From what I have researched IT/coding courses like ours are in high demand in London but that demand only seems high when compared to the rest of UK. Point is , employment overall is pretty bad in the Uk but London is the best out of all the other cities. You can expect a grad scheme job of about 30-55k pre tax in tech for a fresher with 0 experience. Also your work visa will typically be 2 years, I know a lot of people from top schools like LSE who were working in reputable firms like EY that didn\u2019t get a visa renewal after the 2 year period. Reason being that tech jobs maybe high in demand but layoffs are also equally high. There are a lot if reasons for this, UK\u2019s economy has not been great in general plus the global recession right now is making it worse. Companies usually hire a lot of freshers but only retain a few because they simply can\u2019t afford to pay so many people for senior level jobs after a few years. This is the information I have after speaking with a few people, I may have been misled about a few points but I hope was able to help you to the best of my abilities. Overall though, if you\u2019re self funding your education entirely, risk should be relatively low, go to Imperial since the education quality is excellent. But, if you\u2019re taking a debt/loan from somewhere, please consider all the factors very very carefully before choosing London.",

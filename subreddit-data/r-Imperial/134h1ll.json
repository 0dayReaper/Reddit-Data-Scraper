I have made a few postgraduate application for Mathematics, but none so far for CS.\n\nBackground:\n\nBSc. (Honours) Mathematics (3.67/4). Some coding experience (implemented mathematical algos like Simplex Algorithm on Python w/o any special libraries ).\n\nI understand that ICL's MSc. Computing is still open, but is it futile to apply given the timing and my background?",

Since the applications are still open I\u2019d assume there\u2019s still places available, but, as you know, your chances will likely be worse than if you apply early in the cycle - but still not 0. The worst that can happen is you lose the \u00a380 application fee and have to apply again in September",

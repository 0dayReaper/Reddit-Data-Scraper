    "postText": "Hello all, I was surprised to receive an invite to interview after a nightmarish AMAT performance (I feel I'm a reserve candidate in case others do really bad). On the email, it was mentioned that it would be particularly ideal to have a double camera setup to show your working on paper. Is this something they really expect people to do? I can imagine its a huge help, so is there any simple way to achieve this? Thanks in advance.",

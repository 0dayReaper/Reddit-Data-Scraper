From what I\u2019ve learned, Imperial is better for tech programs but UCL is better for health programs. Since it\u2019s a mix of the two I\u2019m kinda torn. Any advice would be appreciated!",

A bit disappointed Imperial only gives 2-3 lines as a description of the content.  If I am paying 14K I want to know what I am studying.\n\nHowever, to be honest, very few / nobody is becoming a DS after this MSc. To become a DS, you need a Bachelor's in DS, CS , Eng + an MSc in DS (which covers DS in detail and requires a CS / Eng background), especially in the era of GenAI.\n\nIf you want to become a DS start thinking about a PhD that applies DS. If you think about a PhD look at the current job market. Also, only 1 out 4 PhD students do a post-doc and only 3% of PhD become PIs. \n\nI think a more realistic career after this MSc is Data Analyst.",

Even just the final score would be appreciated.\n\nThank You",

            "comment": "I applied for Aeronautics and on the website it said typical offers are around 40. However, when I finally applied, my conditional offer requirement was a total of 42 with 776 HL. This may have been because my application wasn\u2019t very strong or maybe my interview didn\u2019t go as well as I thought. Ended up getting a 44 with a 777 HL so it didn\u2019t really matter",

Then, your predicted, and ur personal statement will determine whether you will get an offer/be considered for interview. General rule of thumb is if you meet minimal requirements seen on the website and your personal statement is decent, most likely you will get an offer (however this depends greatly on the total number of applications that year).",

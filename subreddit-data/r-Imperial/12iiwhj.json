    "postText": "To all international students coming to Imperial for their Masters\u2019s this year. I\u2019m sure that like myself, all of you would have been advised to stay away from the UK given the bad economy and shortage of employment at some point or the other by friends/family etc. Despite knowing this, what is making you guys take out huge education loan to fund your education at Imperial? I just want to know as a 23-24 admit myself. Maybe there\u2019s a good side of studying in the Uk that no one is mentioning.",

            "comment": "Idk, there's lots of factors I'm considering, the price is pretty hard to get around and finding loans has not been easy by any means, but on the positive side\n1. it seems like long term a great career opportunity (I guess it depends on your masters and what the prospects are in that field)\n2. also I think I'll really enjoy my time there studying\n3. I'll learn a lot that I don't think I could at any other uni (only imperial and Harvard offer the master's I'm going for)\n4. I'll probably build a network of cool/smart/interesting  people which seems great socially and again for career prospects\n5. Atm I live in my countries biggest city, which to me still seems small so I'd like to experience a BIG city, where I can get Mac Donald's at 2am \n\nI'd be pretty interested to hear your reasoning either way cause I haven't accepted yet due to still thinking about it, but atm I'm leaning heavily towards taking it",

                    "comment": "I am pursuing an MSc in Business Analytics which is a hot industry right now ( machine learning, business intelligence, data science are some of the terms you might be familiar with in case you don\u2019t know this industry). I have an admit from both NUS ans Imperial for this course. Like you, even I was leaning towards Imperial for a long time because well it has a brand name and the university has been around for a long time, I grew up listening to my parents talk about unis like Oxford, Imperial and Cambridge. But well, in the end , I can\u2019t justify the cost. Nus is giving me a scholarship of around 20,000 SGD, a paid 6 month internship, Singapore is a lot closer to my home country so frequent visits aren\u2019t very expensive and SG is a very safe place to study in overall. London doesn\u2019t offer any of this, all it has is the brand name. Now granted, employment opportunities are not plenty in both countries but still, Singapore is a superior nation in terms of the tech industry and I believe the internship will help me land a job. Simply put, my only inclination towards London was the brand value and the fact that I craved to witness the night life and party scene that every student boasts about. I have realised now though that I probably won\u2019t have time to loaf around as much during a 1 year course anyway given the short time and rigorous coursework and well, even if I did, it simply wouldn\u2019t be a strong enough reason for me to take such a huge debt. I have spent almost 2 months debating with myself on this topic and I have summarised everything I have learnt so far. You can find my previous posts on this sub as well subreddits of NUS and grad admissions. Hope this helps!",

NUS seems to be well known in some places but less so in others, (which I guess is the same as imperial, just different places). From my friends doing internships there it seems awesome but I think I'd personally prefer living in London than Singapore. Enjoy NUS!",

As an international I don\u2019t really enjoy UK for all the reasons you listed, and especially the price- everything feels like a rip off. I personally enjoyed SG nightlife more than UK; but I wasn\u2019t in London and Im asian so I might be biased. I would think for something lik business analytics, employers would value internships more than which top school you went to.\n\nAnyways after talking crap about uk im still going to imperial 23-24",

Some of these courses are worth every penny, they open doors for jobs not only in the UK but also world wide, so the UK economy might be less important if you are working elsewhere. Also, many masters are a good preparation for PhD and research programs. Also don\u2019t forget many students come with scholarships.",

But never ever forget one thing, your one step can make or mar your future self. If you do not take a step towards getting into Imperial, maybe your future self would never know how it'd have been had you gone. Had you failed or had you been successful if you'd gone. Do you wanna live in oblivion? Or do you wanna live a life where you see problems, face it, squash it, and move on? \n\nThe decision is yours. In any case, would love to see you in London. I'm getting there next year 2024-2025. See you around. Hopefully.",

I will have to take out a debt for both but lesser so for the other uni. I understand the glamour of studying at Imperial but I have to consider the financial pressure on myself as well as my family before I act emotionally. I have highlighted my thoughts in depth in another comment under this thread. Please take a look at that and tell me if I\u2019m wrong anywhere. Seriously, I hope I\u2019m wrong about something or there are some positives I am missing out on because currently I just can\u2019t justify Imperial no matter how much my heart may want it.",

NUS is a top uni, have I had Singapore on my cards, that is the place I'd go too. Was i in your boots, I'd do just as you're doing.

So even if you do not find a suitable prospect in London, or worst case UK itself, you may explore Europe and UAE. You can hedge your risk by applying for a PSW for a cushion period until you get your post master's employment sorted. Another thing that I know about Imperial is that it is A1 in technology. Even my course which is predominantly numbers and finance, they have tons and tons of coding in it. Something as lucrative as analytics, i don't feel you'd fail to find jobs AT ALL, yes there'll be a lil struggle though, as would be in any other course. Also, the alumni network would help you big time in case you do not find suitable employment. So many past imperial students who are placed in big companies now helped me about getting clarity on Imperial on LinkedIn just for the fact that they were Imperial alumni. The UK economy may be down, but none stays the same. Everything that hits rock bottom has to go up someday, hopefully.",

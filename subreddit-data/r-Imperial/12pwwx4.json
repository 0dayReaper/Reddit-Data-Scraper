    "postText": "I go to a specialist uni in central so the student body is tiny. I've been wondering where ppl from KCL, UCL, Imperial, QMU etc go. Mainly looking for bars but also clubs that have 'bar areas' or more spots to talk and mingle rather than just pure dance clubs.\n\nI've checked out Shoreditch on a Friday &amp; Saturday which was ok but seemed to be an older crowd and not many students particularly. I'm not sure if it's the area or day of the week which let us down (or both)\n\nOpen to suggestions anywhere within Zone 1+2.\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a foreign student doing a study abroad program (one semester in London) that gives me access to Imperial College Union. I want to interact with the locals more and, more importantly, with other students. I've been scrolling through Imperial College Union's site and found a couple of clubs and societies that I'm interested in: History, ABACUS, and Korean. However, I have a few questions about each of these clubs. How active are they? How do I keep myself updated about club activities (Discord? Instagram? Facebook?)? How do I join? Also if there are any other fun clubs to join feel free to let me know.",

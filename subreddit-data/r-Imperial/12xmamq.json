    "postText": "Current student here - I was wondering if there's anyone who managed to interrupt their studies right before May exam. I have been getting really irritational symptoms all over my skin, and it's been so horrible I couldn't focus on my exam revision. This led me to have my first ever mental health crisis. I genuinely thought I was immune to mental health issues, but I guess no one is \ud83e\udd72\n\nI'm talking to my personal tutor soon (I've arranged it with my tutor), but I wanted to ask if anyone had gone though similar experiences.",

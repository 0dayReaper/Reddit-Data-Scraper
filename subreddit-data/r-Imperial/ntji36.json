    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019ll be joining as a master\u2019s student from October and I was wondering how much rent is? I\u2019m willing to live within a 40-45 minute walk from campus if it comes to it, as I\u2019d rather not pay for travel. Can you get accommodation for \u00a3600-750? \u00a3750 is my max budget per month. Also, would I need to live in a shared student house to get these prices?\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll be in the South Kensington campus.",

But you should be able to get something in Hammersmith, Fulham, Putney way for that. Likely on the small side and not great condition for that price though.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m willing to live within a 40-45 minute walk from campus if it comes to it, as I\u2019d rather not pay for travel. \n\nLook at biking. That 40-45 minute walk becomes 10-15 minutes on a bike. Also Buses are cheap.",

But I would suggest getting something that is roadworthy, but doesn't look worth stealing. Also a decent D lock on the body and chain through the front wheel at a minimum.",

If it does then the area surrounding Imperial might not be very affordable. \n\nYou can probably get a small room in a flatshare for that price, but if you tend to stay at home a lot it might be better to venture a little further out (Zone 3) for a better room. Not sure if you can get private student accommodation with that price. Like the others have said, bikes may be a good option.. or an electric scooter.",

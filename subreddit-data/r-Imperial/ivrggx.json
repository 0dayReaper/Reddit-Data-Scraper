    "postText": "I will be staying at GradPad Griffon Studios and have been thinking of commuting by bicycle in view of the pandemic. Could anyone with experience share with me how safe or unsafe the roads are? I cycle a lot but come from Singapore and have never had to share a lane with vehicles. Suffice to say, I don't feel safe at all. This is the only video I could find on youtube from Clapham to South Ken but that was 7 years ago and so things might have changed. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vad_PkXEGTU\n\nCould anyone also share with me how difficult it is to get onto the bus - especially bus numbers 345 and 49 - with the reduced number of passengers allowed? Thank you everyone.",

            "comment": "I used to do a very similar commute, and would recommend that you build your confidence up before attempting this route.\n\nIt's not a particularly nice one, since CS8 (Cycle Superhighway 8) is merely blue paint on the road, and the stretch along Battersea Park Road isn't wide enough for three motorised lanes and two cycle lanes, particularly at peak times. The gyratory system beside Battersea Park isn't too fun either!\n\nThe backstreets of Kensington &amp; Chelsea are reasonably quiet, but you must take the lane due to all the parked cars and various vehicles flying around junctions without looking. The side streets to Queen's Gate are nicer than the route shown.\n\nAlso don't use that video as a guide: that cyclist jumps at least one red light and their road positioning is awful.\n\nI'm not aware of any upgrades to the infrastructure along that route. Both Kensington &amp; Chelsea and Wandsworth councils are anti-cycist, therefore I doubt they will be upgraded anytime soon.\n\nI don't know what the buses are like nowadays, but the 49 starts on Northcote Road (a short walk away) and therefore should be relatively empty by the time you climb aboard. The 319 is also an option, should you wish to jump off early and grab a coffee.",

You'll see immediately how much of the route is dedicated cycle lanes, quiet streets (ie not the yellow big roads), etc.\n\nAlso, Citymapper app has a cool route function whether you can select quiet or fastest cycle route.\n\nGenerally, there is a good network of cycle paths, and its been hugely upgraded this year during COVID.",

Would recommend installing CityMapper to check routes beforehand.",

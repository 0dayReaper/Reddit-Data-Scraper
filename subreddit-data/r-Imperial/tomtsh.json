    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m a degree apprentice at Cisco and I am working with others to provide free mentorship to university students. The mentors will be Cisco employees who are experienced in their career and even though Cisco is a technology company, we have lots of volunteers in various non-tech roles such as sales, project management and business operations.\n\nOur aim is to provide free mentorship to university students to prepare them for the working world and give them guidance on how they can achieve their goals in the tech, business and related industries.\n\n**Application link:**\n\n[https://forms.gle/TrHA3v2omHhKmBYXA](https://forms.gle/TrHA3v2omHhKmBYXA)\n\n**Who is eligible to apply?**\n\nUniversity students who are interested in tech, business and similar areas are eligible to apply.\n\n**Where does this take place?**\n\nAll sessions take place online, most likely over Webex.\n\n**How often will I be mentored?**\n\nYou will get at least one 30 minute session with your mentor and follow up sessions can be decided between you and your mentor to take place until the end of April.\n\n**What will I gain from this?**\n\nYou will gain connections with industry professionals from Cisco and get free career advice and guidance. This can be a great way to introduce you to the different roles within your field of interest and learn what you can do to achieve them, including how to get internships in those fields and much more!\n\n**View our website:**\n\n[https://mentorusall.org](https://mentorusall.org)\n\n**Contact us:**\n\n[mentorusall@gmail.com](mailto:mentorusall@gmail.com)\n\n**Note:**\n\nPlease note that there are limited spaces available and that students are randomly selected.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nWe are not sponsored by Cisco, we are just a mentorship organisation that has volunteers that work at Cisco.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can also check me out on LinkedIn to confirm I\u2019m legit: in/zoyalodhia",

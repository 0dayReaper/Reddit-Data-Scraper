Link your Dropbox account to your school email to earn points for Imperial that goes towards increasing Dropbox storage for all of us at Imperial. Three years ago we unlocked 18GB for extra space for all Imperial linked accounts. Very useful for group projects and the like!\n\nSign up here and spread the word!\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/campuscup",

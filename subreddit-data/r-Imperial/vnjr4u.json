    "postText": "Hi everyone ! In short, I received an offer for the Chem Eng (MEng) course at Imperial among other unis and I'm doubtful regarding which would be best for me. I especially hesitate between EPFL in Switzerland and Imperial. The thing is, I'm still a bit confused regarding the content of the course at Imperial. I really enjoy chemistry, so what is the percentage of chemistry studied in Chemical Engineering ? \n\nIf some students could enlighten me a bit, it would be great :')\n\nThanks in advance.",

At any uni. Decent chemical engineering courses don't have much chemistry because it's a very different subject.",

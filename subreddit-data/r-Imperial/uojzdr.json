            "comment": "Hey there! So I usually focus on ChemEng applications (I run a YouTube account for this specifically, same name as this account) , and I\u2019m aiming to make a video on this topic soon, but I\u2019ll give some quick tips on top of what people have already suggested here-\n\n- Participate in Olympiads. Any Olympiad you can take part in (specifically chemistry because that is what you said you want to apply for) will reflect really well on your application when you come to putting it in, and doing the maths and chemistry Olympiads are the best way to get a good background of extracurriculars for this.\n\n- Read chemistry books. By this I mean there are some really good books written about chemistry like \u201cperiodic tales\u201d by Hugh Aldersey-Williams and \u201cthe periodic kingdom\u201d by Peter Atkins, and they really show your interest in chemistry and going beyond the scope of just exams and the curriculum. A good place to find more for chemistry is the Oxford and Cambridge recommended chemistry reading, you should be able to find these on their websites or by searching \u201cgood books for chemistry university personal statement\u201d.\n\n- Projects. A good way to show your interest in chemistry is by doing project works, either independently with your school in a chemistry club or something, or with an already set up institution. I think the best one to look at would be the CREST silver or gold award, which you could undertake under the summer.\n\n- Clubs. I\u2019d suggest joining your school stem club/ chemistry/science club and taking an active role in what they do because this will also strengthen your application a lot- if you don\u2019t have any such club at your school, I\u2019d recommend maybe talking to your chemistry department and suggesting to run this, and you can get a couple of others to help because nothing will show your interest better than \u201cI started the schools\u2019 STEM/chemistry club and explored xyz with weekly sessions where we did experiments and etc etc\u201d.\n\n- Work experience. Now I have left this to the end as it probably the hardest to secure, as it is very hard to get specific work experience for any STEM discipline that is not medicine because very few scheme exist for pre-university level, and even fewer take on many students, so you should try to get onto this because it will help with showing your passion for the degree area. I\u2019d recommend maybe checking on springpod to find some virtual work experience, and if not, you can always put together a CV and send an email directly to local chemistry companies (labs, utilise your school teachers connection to current chemists, etc etc) and detail that you are looking for an opportunity and would really like to experience chemistry either by shadowing or doing a placement there.\n\nThese tips should hopefully help you with your application, but you should definitely check if they are available in Canada.\n\nDo not hesitate to ask further question if you have any! \n\nBest,\nChemEngWeekly \n\nTLDR; CREST award, Olympiads, chemistry books, spring pod work experience and STEM club.",

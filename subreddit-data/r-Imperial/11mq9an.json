    "postText": "I have applied to ChemEng and had an online interview almost 2 weeks ago on 23rd February. At the end of the interview, I heard the interviewer said that they\u2019ll be giving me an offer, and he continued to tell me about applying for the ATAS clearance. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost 2 weeks and I haven\u2019t heard back from them. Ever since the interview, I kept worrying that I misheard the interviewer, or that it was a test to see how excited I looked \ud83d\ude03. \n\nTo those of you who received verbal offers, how long did it take before receiving an official letter? Should I reach out to my interviewer?",

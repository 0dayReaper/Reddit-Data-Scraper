    "postText": "Yeah I know there's like a dozen other posts on this, but can someone actually explain what type of questions are there instead of just saying 'logic and maths' and 'you can't prepare for it'. \n\nI'll be doing it in a few months and the thing is, I won't have a chance if I don't prepare. I couldn't prepare for the SMC and so got only bronze but for my A-Levels mocks I did literally tons of past Qs and got predicted A\\* in both maths and FM.\n\nSo all I'm asking is can someone give an example question, or at least tell me which one I should practise with out of MAT/CTMUA/CSAT/SMC.\n\nThanks.",

I spent hours scanning every Reddit post and the internet trying to find stuff to prepare for this test and it was a massive waste of time. As long as you understand basic programming principles and I mean basic like declaring variables you will be fine.  If you are desperate look at a few brain teaser math-ish riddle questions and some algorithm variable tracing but other than that relax and chill. Don't expect to finish either. Good luck!",

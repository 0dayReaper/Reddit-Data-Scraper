    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI am looking to apply for the MSc Computing conversion course at Imperial having recently graduated out of Bristol with a first in a non-tech field. Does anyone who has followed a similar path have any advice to help strengthen my application?\n\nI have been completing some coding courses in C++ and JS at Codecademy, however I'm curious as to whther there is anything more targeted that I might get on with to really help push my application over the line.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this. Any response will be much appreciated.",

I received an offer for Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) at University of Nottingham several weeks ago, and I'm still waiting for other offers.\n\nIf you want to apply for conversion course starting from this autumn, well, I think it's quite hard since it's highly competitive. You can underscore why you want to study computer science , your skill sets and your learning ability.\n\nBut if you apply for it in this autumn or later, I think maybe you can find an internship. I learned some Python and deep learning courses online and found an internship in a small computer vision company. This experience helped me a lot.",

The MSc programs at imperial are usually very intense so I\u2019d be surprised if you\u2019re allowed to be part of such jobs, also hard to fit in your schedule",

Since you haven't done the full undergrad it might be a bit more difficult for you cause you havent seen the labs before, but I think you can probably still do it.",

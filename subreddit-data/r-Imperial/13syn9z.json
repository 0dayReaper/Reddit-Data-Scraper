    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm looking for someone to take over my lease for a studio apartment at The Lyra. It's a great place to live, with a private bathroom, kitchenette, and study area. It's also fully furnished and has high-speed wifi. This price is lower than the current rental price. The post code is W3 6BX (near North Acton). The lease is from Sep 9, 2023 to Aug 31, 2024. The location is convenient, with supermarkets and bus stops nearby. If you're interested, please message me and I'll send you more details and photos. Thanks! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2av852q4b2b1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fca5262cafd57ff7f5bc5968d877d219b54be5a7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/464aqwkp4b2b1.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9ee3f54284204c0547e292e2fdbfe4c2173df5dc",

Not sure what that code is supposed to be for, either. But figured I\u2019d mention it, given it\u2019s somewhat important information to have correct, haha",

    "postText": " Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a student at a normal university (Coventry University), I am currently going to my last year of Business Administration with a foundation done in Business Management. In my 2nd year, I finished with a 2.1 but I hope to finish with a 1st next year, I was wondering if it is possible to get in at ICL if I finish with a 2.1 (best case would be 1st), and a good GMAT score. Is it possible to study MSc Investment &amp; Wealth Management at ICL while coming from a Business Administration/Management degree at a less prestigious university? \n\nAnother question is funding, I believe the government does not fund the full amount required for top Masters, if so, how do people get those loans?\n\nI sincerely appreciate any help given!",

I guess you can expect to be on \u00a360k after 2-3 years of experience. After that it's kind of up to you, you could end up on a very high salary if you push for it and get a job somewhere like Google, or you can coast on \u00a360-70k for some time. Depends on your financial situation.\n\nA salary of \u00a330k will leave you with ~\u00a32k per month after taxes. If you knock off \u00a3700pm for rent that means you are left with \u00a31.3k pm. That would normally be more than enough to live on in London and save for house deposit, but it really depends on how much your loan repayments are going to be. If your loans are for the degree in India then you'll probably be okay because the lower cost of living there gives you a tenfold advantage in purchasing power. Any loans for your MSc will be more expensive obviously.",

He earns \u00a354,000 per year and works around 25 hours per week as they have no minimum hours. The best part is he works fully remote so we live in Yorkshire and still get the London wage \ud83d\ude05 \n\nThey generally give them at least one decent pay rise per year (around \u00a35000). They have him lined up to be a Senior Engineer at the end of this year which I believe that starting salary is between \u00a365,000 and \u00a370,000 at his company.",

And in a couple of years, once they have that experience I\u2019ve seen them move to \u00a370,000+ easy.\n\nHowever the development market is starting to change drastically. I\u2019m only seeing a very small period so don\u2019t know how well this will travel in the future, but junior devs are starting to go out of fashion. A couple of roles now are a lot lower than \u00a335,000. Some I\u2019ve seen start at \u00a320,000, however seniors with a large amount of experience wages have been increasing by a fair amount.\n\nIt\u2019s a cross between market saturation (boot camps, uni leavers etc) and new AI technology.\n\nAs a senior dev, I no longer need a junior doing my grunt work, I can spin up a gpt-4 request and get a function or component built in seconds, and now with tests.\n\nA senior will know how to integrate this correctly in a system, and check it\u2019s correct, make adjustments etc. whilst a junior would struggle, or wouldn\u2019t understand the logistics behind it.\n\nThere will always be a market for software developers, you will always have a job for the short/ medium term. However the wages are certainly going to drop dramatically in the years to come.",

In the United States, buyers are much more likely to take risk as 'early adopters'. This means that shiny new software can be priced at how much value it would give back to the buyer.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, buyers are much more conservative and tend to buy proven software that others have already installed. By that time, several software competitors with the same functionality would have been created. With competition, software is sold more as a commodity (feature/function). As anyone working in software sales knows, this reduces the size of the deal substantially.\n\nLong story short - salaries paid by software companies are a product of their profitability",

Save yourself the fees, do a BSc - but be prepared for your 3rd year to be a lot of work (it's pretty much the 2 final MSc years in 1). \n2. Imperial has lots of job opportunities - go to job fairs and hackathons, speak to the recruiters there, a lot of companies like imperial grads and it's in London so there's a lot of opportunities nearby. -- I saw you'd done some extracurricular stuff, put that on your CV and you'll do great - make sure you look out for internships and jobs though, companies won't just know, make sure they know you exist! I almost missed a first year internship because I didn't go looking until it was almost too late. \n3. Internships during summers can be pretty profitable and also help you get a foot in the door after, I got my current job because I'd done an internship over the summer in my first year and the manager liked me and the work I did.\n\nRegarding salaries, I started circa 50k and got a decent pay bump at the end of my first year.

            "comment": "What exactly did you specialize in in the \"advanced computing\" masters? I currently work in tech in London as a SWE and, basically, depends on what industry you fall. However, by and large, I can tell you large tech companies with a presence in London were paying a new grad \u00a350-60k plus stock a few years ago. They might pay more since you have a master's. The SWE job market has taken a turn for the worse the last year though, so salaries may not be as good or jobs might be a bit harder to get.\n\nIf you go to a software job in finance however (e.g. trading) you can usually get even higher salaries. Not sure how rolling they are to hire new-grads however and whether the salaries are as high for new grads. The job will likely be very intense, with long hours, and result in burn out if you're not careful, but if you just want to pay off your debts quickly it's not the worst idea.",

My suggestion is to enjoy the learning but not for the career, it is just a matter of time to gain the experience, insight and knowledge about the design, the trade off, the actual implementation.",

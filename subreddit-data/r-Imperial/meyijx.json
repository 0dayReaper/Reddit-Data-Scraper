    "postText": "Hi there. I wish to apply for the Meng biomedical engineering program, however, it's the entry requirement for 2022 is 39 IB points with 6,6,6 in HL. I have 38 IB points with 6 in Physics, Chemistry and Math HL each (which was last year's entry requirement). Am I still eligible to apply? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated",

It would probably come down to whether imperial like you or not. There is a high chance they will invite you to an interview ( I think they interview most applicants ) so it just depends on how well you do in that. If you do well they would probably overlook the marginal difference.",

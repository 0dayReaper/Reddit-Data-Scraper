    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m looking at studios at Academic House and am an incoming master\u2019s student at Imperial\u2019s business school. However, a lot of people haven\u2019t heard about the property even though the letting organisation has been recommended by Imperial on their suggest private accoms page. Everything there suits my needs but it\u2019s a bit of a worry how people don\u2019t know about it. It\u2019d be great if I could get some insight about the property!",

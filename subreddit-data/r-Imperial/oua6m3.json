In the UK, the top grade is at 70% or higher, the next highest grade at 60%-70%, and so on down to 40% which is the pass value.\n\nA 65% in your first year, especially one like this, is a great result. If you want a First (ie 70% or higher) you can likely do it still.\n\n65% is a great result and you will be in the top half of your year.",

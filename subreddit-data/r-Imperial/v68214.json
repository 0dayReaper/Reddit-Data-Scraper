    "postText": "I'm taking Math, Physics and Further Mathematics for A Level. I already have an A* in Math (sat the exam in November 2021), and I just finished my Physics and further maths exams. I think I did well in physics (expecting an A*), in Further math however I kinda messed up in my further pure 2 exam, my nose started bleeding in the middle of the exam and I couldn't finish on time, ended up leaving an 11 marker empty. According to my calculations I think I'll get 210/250 overall, in last year's grade thresholds an A* was 215/250. So there's a high chance that I might get an A. Also no one in the history of my country has ever done further math A level. My school doesn't teach the A2 syllabus and has never heard of further math. So I self-studied everything apart from AS physics and AS math. Is there anyway imperial can accept me with only 2 A stars and 1 A. What do I have to do now?",

This was 2014 but the fundamental situation is the same- they will have an idea of a fixed number of places, and narrowly missing a grade doesn't necessarily mean you won't get in but it does put you more on the back foot if most successful applicants do make the grade and spaces are short.",

Why did they give me a 3A* offer I'm still curious? I know some people who got in with only A*AA. Anyway thanks for this info 2 months ago and sorry i didn't reply earlier.",

For whatever reason they've given different offers to different people; perhaps they wanted 'more evidence' that you were up to standard (in reality I'm sure you are with those results but hey, I'm not the admissions team). How close were you to the further maths A*? Would you need to resit all the modules or just a couple to bump up the grade? Also, what unis were your other offers from and are you considering them- imperial isn't the only good uni.",

I only need to re-sit the paper that I messed up cuz of my nose bleed, but idk if this is possible. I got offers  from Manchester, Nottingham and Kings but I can't afford them. I also can't afford Imperial but since it's in the top 10 I could've gotten a scholarship from my country, they usually give these to Olympiad students like me who manage to get in to top 10 unis.",

Make sure to describe what you have said here, about you being the first in your country to do this course and the fact that you had to self teach everything.\nThis way, when the committee are doing the admissions, the admissions officer will have your name and (admirable) story in their mind and may fight to get you your place.\nThe people on the admission committee aren't robots, they're people and may take these sorts of things into account.",

I ended up getting 2 A stars and an A with the A in Further Mathematics. Unfortunately, you were wrong: the admissions committee are robots indeed. They ended up rejecting me and I wrote them another email but still no use. I'm heartbroken and I don't know what to do. I'll take a gap year and apply again but I'm not sure if it is worth retaking Further Mathematics, and I don't know how some people got in to EEE with only A*AA. Some didn't even do Further Maths and still got in.",

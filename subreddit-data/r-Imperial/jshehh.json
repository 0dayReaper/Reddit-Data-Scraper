    "postText": "So I just got called to interview for this course here, and I just wanna know how bad I\u2019m gonna screw it. On the email I got sent it said it\u2019s going to be conducted be the materials and engineering interview. I don\u2019t do too much hardcore engineering stuff, I don\u2019t even do physics. My personal statement is all focused around biomed and bioengineering(relating to the brain) because most of the courses I\u2019m applying to relate to that. There is literally nothing to do with materials or even tissue engineering really. To be honest I wasn\u2019t even expecting an interview from this course. Is the interviewer just gonna be like, well nothing here shows me you want to do this course. From first glance this is true, but I am super interested in biomedical engineering and have done lots of reading relating to that, but if they start asking about general material engineering, I think I\u2019m probably fucked. What do I do to prepare for this. \n\nAlso as a side note, what\u2019s the best way to have a great time at imperial, most people I talk to say imperial uni life is not very fun and it\u2019s all about academics, are there groups of people that I could go drinking with and have a good time?",

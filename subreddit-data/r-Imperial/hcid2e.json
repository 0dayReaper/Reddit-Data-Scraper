    "postText": "I am danish, so I was required to get 12 in mathematics (A*), 11 average grade, 11 in physics, and 11 in electronics (11 is an A). However, I got 3 12s and a 10 in maths, making me drop to 11.5, below the required 12. I did get 12 in both physics and electronics, and an average grade of 11.5, making me much better off in their other requirements.\n\nI am disputing my 10 in maths, but does anyone know if they would be lenient with the grade in maths? I am applying for EIE.",

    "postText": "Hello! I recently received an offer for MSc Business Analytics at Imperial College Business School.\n\nVery happy since I know entry to this program is notoriously competitive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone know about the start date for this program? It only says September 2023 but I wish to know the exact date. I heard from someone that the program begins at September 23rd but I'm not sure. Does anyone here know exactly when (what date) the program begins? Thank you!",

I think they would confirm once it is closer to the start date.  \nIf it's okay to ask, What mode of the program are you potentially attending?",

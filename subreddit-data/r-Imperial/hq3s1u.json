    "postText": "Hello, I know this has been asked in previous years but seeing as this year is unique with no twin rooms, Pembridge and Parsons reopening, changed rents, and so on, I wanted to ask some current students to give their opinions of the first year undergraduate halls for the upcoming year.\n\nHere\u2019s my take of them so far. Please clear up any misconceptions I might have from reading biased, outdated posts from TSR.\n\nEastside/Southside: expensive but convenient, high quality rooms, lots of international students who apparently don\u2019t socialise?\nBeit: also expensive but convenient, med/high quality rooms, can be very loud when there are events so you can\u2019t sleep well when these are happening\nWilson: a compromise between price and distance, med quality rooms, probably my favourite hall, lots of doors...?\nXenia: the commute is somewhat far, med quality rooms, haven\u2019t heard much about this hall tbh\nWoodward: more affordable and high quality rooms but far away, some people have said this hall has the best parties, others say it\u2019s the worst if you want a social life, 40+ min commute sounds bad but still manageable if I had to do it, there\u2019ll be some disruptive construction work later in the year and rents have been reduced slightly due to this\nKemp Porter: opening this year, probably similar to Woodward?\nPembridge: not too far, low quality rooms and bad internet?\nParsons: have to commute, low quality rooms (standard singles only) and bad internet too?\n\nI\u2019m kind of paranoid about COVID so would prefer an en-suite room, but can\u2019t afford the ridiculous rents of the en-suite rooms close to campus and would have to commute by tube/bus, which also isn\u2019t ideal. However, if more teaching is online then I suppose the commute wouldn\u2019t be as frequent. This would also mean a strong internet connection is more important so can anyone who lived at Pembridge confirm/deny its \u2018bad\u2019 internet?\n\nParents suggested living at home and commuting in whenever there was in-person teaching (would take about an hour each way). I really don\u2019t want to do this because my social life really would be non-existent.\n\nPersonally, I would probably choose the inconvenience of living in a hall further from South Ken over being a hostage to my finances (but be forever jealous of the people who can walk out of bed straight on to campus).\n\nThanks in advance everyone, this would be so helpful with applications about to open.",

            "comment": "If commuting is not that important since most teaching will be online anyway, and you want a guaranteed cheap ensuite room, then Woodward sounds right for you. It's got the newest rooms and facilities (except for kempt porter) and with kempt porter that area will have the largest imperial student community. Personally I had an amazing experience in Woodward and the really nice and big common room allowed for amazing parties. Study rooms are nice too. Internet was good.",

Wilson was fantastic when I lived there, you grow to enjoy the Hyde Park walk. you do have to open around 8 doors to get to your room though. I've heard good things about Beit over the more expensive south ken halls for community and social life. Woodward is workable but I wouldn't recommend unless you're really cash strapped. Good luck choosing!",

            "comment": "Everything is on point. I would put Kemp Porter higher than Woodward as it\u2019s basically the same (same location and size) but newer. When I was at Woodward it was already showing signs of wear 2 years after it was built. It also wasn\u2019t designed very well, social spaces were not equipped to handle the number of people there. Hopefully Kemp Porter has taken all this into account. Distance really sucks though and the tube journey is pretty meh. If you put Woodward and/or Kemp as one of your five choices, you will get in to it for certain (since statistically 700 and 600 rooms respectively). If you want to live close to uni, then only put the other halls as your five choices. I hated how far away I was from uni, and wished to have lived closer (for many reasons). But considering the situation now, being close to uni might not matter much.",

                            "comment": "It was mainly for the societies and the choice to go home and relax if there was hours of down time between lectures. Eating at home is possible for lunch if you live close to uni (Southside, Eastside, Beit). I personally dislike the food choices offered at campus and there isn\u2019t much of a social aspect of eating with friends since it\u2019s so crowded. It also sucks if you have lectures 9-12 then 4-6, since you\u2019ll have to loiter around university for 4 hours or spend 1.5 hours roundtrip between Woodward and Uni. If you like using the library/study facilities at Imperial, and can\u2019t study at home, then being close is a god send. Woodward/Kemp will make you not want to attend lectures as most departments record them. Now onto societies. Imagine you\u2019re doing a sport that requires rackets, equipment, shoes etc. Unless your department has lockers that can fit these things, you\u2019ll have to carry these around all day at Uni since you don\u2019t have time to go home and get it. Materials department has the tiniest lockers (shoe box size), Physics had proper lockers that you had to register for. Not sure about the other departments.",

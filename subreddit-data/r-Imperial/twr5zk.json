            "comment": "the statistics module is in 2nd year, it would probably help with that a bit and also a little with comms cause that's also quite stats heavy. Although from what I briefly read about it, the stats module goes into a lot more depth.   \n\nIf you want to do maths it'd actually be best to work on pure maths, in yr1 maths was the hardest module (almost everyone who failed last year failed the maths module) and it would've been easier for me if I'd done further maths at A level. It is taught really well tho, Nucinkis is amazing. \n\nEither way doing stuff before you come will definitely help cause it can be a challenge to adapt to the workload. \n\nalso eee good (but you dont have to choose until the end of yr 1)",

It does mean there is more to learn but Nucinkis teaches it so if you go to all the lectures and problem classes, and go to the office hours when you're stuck, it won't be a problem at all. \n\nIf you want to do something in the meantime, do all the hardest A level maths stuff you can find and have a look at the EDx maths courses that Imperial offers. Although focus on pure maths, revising stats and mechanics wont help that much.\n\nWould definitely recommend doing some maths over the summer to stop you getting rusty",

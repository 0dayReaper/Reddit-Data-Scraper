    "postText": "I recently got admitted to Imperial chem for both MSci and Bsci programs. I saw that on UCAS I could only choose one firm choice and thus decline all the others. I am still hesitating which one I should choose. I wonder if I could switch to Bsc in the future after I am registered as MSc student? Is it complicated? Thank you so much!",

I once heard that two programs only differ in their personal programs and something comes later on. Is that true? Plus, I'm an international student and I would probably seek for PhD opportunity in US in the future. Will the four-year MSc program put me at disadvantage when applying for PhD program in the US? Again, thank you so much for your kind reply!",

It is pleasant talking to you. Really looking forward to encountering you on campus in the future haha! Anyway a lot of thanks!",

I think this might be because in third year you can choose 4th year courses in 3rd year (1 max) and a few other things.\nAs for going for PhD, you need a 4 year degree to apply to most unis in USA, and MSci provides enough credits to apply straight for phd (it\u2019s like an Mphil in some other unis and countries). It\u2019s designed for those who wanna apply for PhD. And since you\u2019ll be graduating from imperial, there should be absolutely no disadvantage due to your program of choice.",

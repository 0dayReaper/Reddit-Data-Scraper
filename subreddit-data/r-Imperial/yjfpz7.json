    "postText": "I recently applied for the Mechanical Engineering course in Imperial and on their website, they say that I \"may or may not be selected for an admissions test.\" They also said that a couple days before the exam date (Nov 4), I'll be sent an email including details about the exam and a practice test to help me prepare. It's currently November 1st and I haven't received anything. Does this mean that I passed the first screening without the need of a test? Or that I was rejected from the first screening? Or just that they send it quite late?",

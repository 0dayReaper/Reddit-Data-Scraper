    "postText": "Guys, I got an offer from Imperial, but I have one big concern. The conditions I need to reach is IB 40 points overall, including 7 in Math AA HL and Physics HL. I'm not that confident on meeting the conditionals... are there any cases where students still get accepted from Imperial with not acheiving the conditionals? (Especially engineering)",

Everyone there was to be interviewed, and if you weren't a complete moron you got your offer on the day. \n\nThe admissions tutor told us what the conditions would be (if we secured an offer that day), and said \"if you don't meet the conditions don't bother ringing up on results day\". The narrative was that the conditions are a hard requirement, and I met no one at the college who (admitted they) didn't meet the conditions. \n\nWhether there actually is any flexibility, and the narrative is just to get people to work hard at their exams, or whether it's true, I don't know. However, I'm sure if the admissions tutor popped up, they'd say \"no results, no place\".",

There may be some flexibility, there may not be.\n\nWhat I will say though, is there\u2019s no point worrying about things like this. Nobody could tell you for sure - you\u2019d only find out ringing up on the day. Just aim to do as well as you can, and deal with the \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019 later!",

Eng. was evidently under subbed that year and some people got in through clearing with low results (I recall meeting one guy with BCD at A-Level doing that course). I'd suspect that that department would've been generous with missed offers that year.",

When I received my A-level results (on a Friday), I only had a C - but I had an A in physics when a B or a C would have been OK.\n\nI immediately rang the admissions office and was told to ring back the following week (on Wednesday IIRC, but it is nearly 40 years ago now). The intervening few days were torture, but when I called again, I was told that my place was confirmed.\n\nWhen I started at IC a few weeks later, I was surprised to encounter several more fellow students who had failed to meet their offer criteria, some of whom had missed by more than I had.  Until that point, I had assumed that my physics result had been what had saved me (it must have helped), but I met one student whose A-level results were significantly lower overall than his offer, but was still accepted.",

This was for physics, so it should be similar for engineering too I think.",

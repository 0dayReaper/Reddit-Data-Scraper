    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am considering pursuing a MSc in Computing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) at Imperial College London. I have a few questions and would appreciate any insights or advice from those who have studied at or have knowledge of the institution.\n\n1. Are online video lectures the norm for courses at Imperial College London?\n\n2. How does the MSc in Computing (AI and ML) at Imperial College compare to similar programs at UCL and Edinburgh?\n\nThank you for your time and help!",

            "comment": "I can only answer the first one, but the lectures are generally in person now. Video lectures are often available as supplement to those in-person lectures as well. The exact details will vary from module to module, but generally everything is supposed to be in person now.",

            "comment": "Hi, I did a full undergrad in Aeronautics at Imperial so can answer mostly based on teaching styles :)\n\nAll lectures are \u2018in-person\u2019 but they are recorded and sometimes live-streamed. Personally I attended about 30%, for the really good lecturers/problem classes, and watched on 1.5 times speed the other 70% which weren\u2019t engaging or which I\u2019d usually struggle to follow without pausing and looking up things. Some lecturers also offer mixed mode, where you watch some short pre-lecture videos, and attend the lecture where this content is explained in more detail. In hindsight I\u2019d probably go to more, but at the time I felt embarrassed to stop them and ask questions so it depends how you feel. Imperials official policy is that you must attend everything in person, but attendance is only taken regularly for labs/personal tutor meetings (I believe to check international students are fulfilling their visa requirements).\n\nI had a few pals doing ML/AI at Imperial and at Cambridge, and they say while the content is the same, it\u2019s the project offerings which differ. From experience Imperial projects seem more multi-disciplinary. A friend during his CS undergrad was working on teaching robotics the \u2018human\u2019 way of interacting with a domestic environment, so his ML/AI focus was more on human-robotics collaboration which fed nicely into some Mechatronics work going in the MechEng department. \n\nMost students post their MSc final project reports on ResearchGate, you can take a look at previous projects there to get a grasp of what the offerings are across universities.",

You said that attendance is only regularly taken at labs and supervision sessions, for the other sessions you missed where attendance was recorded on the day - did you face any consequences for absence? Does it affect your final grade in any way?",

I don't know if it's still the case, I'm sure you'll find tons of information regarding courses on the department of computing's website (or you could ask Fariba Sadri, if she's still the MSc coordinator there).\nRegarding the difference with UCL/Edinburgh, I really can't say because last time I looked into other universities was three years ago before applying",

The coursework wasn't interesting because it relied on using OpenCV as a \"black box\" that doesn't work if you provide the wrong flag or whatever \n- advanced computer graphics : course had some interesting but a bit math-heavy at times. Coursework was okay but not very engaging, the material lacks coherence but it contains a lot of different techniques for advanced CG that you've probably never heard of \n- ML for Imaging : interesting technical applications of material seen in other courses. Coursework wasn't great as there were few guidelines as to what to explore",

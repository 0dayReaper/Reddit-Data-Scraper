I really want more friends but I hardly get any opportunities to meet anyone since I don't live in accommodation and the whole pandemic thing.\n\nKinda awkward to ask but message me if you're looking to connect with someone. Especially if you're on aero.",

Idk if you live in halls, but I guess if you do you didn't find any good people in your flat. One thing that could work, if you are that sort of person, is you could join one of the eSports teams. Idk about the others but the csgo team was quite friendly back in the day.",

A*s in two of them as predictions would be good. \n\nif you want a good shot at getting an offer, you need FM. otherwise, forget it tbh.\n\npeople at my school with double A* maths and fm predictions got rejected (with CS as third subject).*\n\nIf they're getting rejected, chemistry will essentially make you and auto-reject.\nMaths FM Physics is a good combination for a multitude of subjects, I highly highly recommend it.",

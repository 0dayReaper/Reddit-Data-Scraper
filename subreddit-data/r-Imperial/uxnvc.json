    "postText": "Just received this on the Software Club mailing list:\n\n&gt; We are pleased to have Keith Mitchel, a developer at Reddit, come over for an informal chat about Reddit, his work, and anything else you like.\n\n&gt; The event will be held on the 22nd of June, starting at 3 pm in Room 344 in the Huxley Building.\n\n&gt; Possible discussion topics:\n\n&gt;* reddit search, why it sucks, and what I'm doing to make it a little better\n    \n&gt;* Dealing with data: reddit's code and data is relatively long in the tooth, and we've got lots of data. When we make changes to how we want to access it, there's often a lengthy migration process.\n\n&gt;* Future of reddit: subreddit discovery, location-based subreddits, and more\n\n&gt;*   How reddit employees work: Our day-to-day, how we communicate, how we decide what to work on, and how we divide up important tasks\n\n&gt;* Why I call myself a programmer or software engineer, and not a computer scientist - or, why I like writing \"glue code\"\n\n&gt;* Anything else - I'm better at answering questions than going off on monologues, so I'd love to hear what people are curious about\n\n\n&gt; Bio:\n\n&gt; I'm a programmer for reddit.com. My areas of focus thus far have been migrating our search solution from IndexTank to Amazon CloudSearch, as well as addressing some bugs in mail and in the self-serve advertising system. (Among other minor things - no one engineer at reddit is focused on one area; we all spread out quite a bit). My next big project will be adding in more native support and features for \"local\" subreddits - cities, countries, colleges, and other subreddits with a location aspect will be able to define their location and be searchable in a handful of ways. Before working at reddit, I was employed by Sun Microsystems (then Oracle), working on the installer for OpenSolaris/Solaris 11.\n\nI suppose that doubles as a meet up then?",

Not sure how it works these days.\n\nAnyway, sounds good, quite a coup for this sub.",

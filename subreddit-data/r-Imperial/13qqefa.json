    "postText": "I received an unconditional offer from Imperial earlier this year for their MSc Business Analytics part-time course (2 years). Due to personal circumstances, I would like to take this course full-time instead. I've also gone ahead to email them to check on this possibility, but wanted to crowdsource info on whether this would likely be possible/if anyone has ever done this before?\n\nTIA!",

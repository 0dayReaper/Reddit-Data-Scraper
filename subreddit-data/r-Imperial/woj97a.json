And also I heard that there is the an interview and math as well as logic exams how can I prepare for those earlier? \n\nThanks a lot for help",

Based on what I know, IC accepts Warwick IFP math and stats as the qualification to enter their maths course but no one last year got accepted(one of my friends is very strong in maths and he attended the interview but eventually got rejected) U need to have very high predicted grades and even some relevant maths competition to get some chance to just get a interview. So good luck!",

In there website they mentioned they accept students form IFP computer science Warwick but I need to get 80% or above overall and in all my subjects I need to have above 80%. If I manage to have that what else do you think I need to have. I\u2019m asking earlier to prepare. Hopefully to get in. Looking forward to your response. Thanks a lot",

Based on what I know, Imperial computing is really competitive, so u should really write out a good personal statement and show ur passion for computing( if u have awards in famous computing competition, they will definitely make ur application stronger ) Also, prepare for STEP maths test and get a good grade. Only a good predicted grade is way too far from a offer as every applicant has this.",

But from what I heard, imperial actually include a step test grade as a condition in the offer, so u should better prepare for the step test, I believe it can be taken in a test centre all over the world.",

    "postText": "I'm an international student who got accepted into Imperial for an MSci in Physics.\n\nHow is the UROP program if I want to explore various things and learn about my interests (specific areas of research I'd be interested in for postgrad)? Also, what about earnings during this UROP, to pay rent and travel expenses and all? Does this programme help you with research skills so that you have an edge when applying for postgrad?  \nAlso, how will I get my first UROP, if lots of those professors are probably working on really modern topics in physics, and I'll obviously not have that knowledge (from the curriculum at least). Am I supposed to find resources and learn those things myself?\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "Imagine UROPs as more of a big bank. If you find an interesting project or research to work on and a member of staff agrees to supervise you, you can then apply for UROP funding. I think the funding is around 350 a week for living expenses, the supervisor pays for everything else. In terms of what you can do, there is really no limit. As part of UROP projects, I have worked on improving an existing course, created new coursework, and made a filament extruder. \n\nMy one concern is that UROPs usually are summer ordeals. You will have technically graduated by then so idk if urops still apply.",

Is it like travelling expenses, food and all that or lab equipments and research funds and all? I'm planning to do them for a few months (2-3) during my vacations, and then go back home (i'm an international student) so I was thinking of saving some money there.",

Otherwise the only pay or benefits you get is the UROP stipend. If the supervisor REALLY likes you, they may be able to pull money from somewhere else. I remember my first UROP was paid for by the MechEng leftover Teaching budget.",

            "comment": "UROP is great, but it\u2019s hard to get funding. In most cases the supervisor may let you work for free as a urop but you have to cover living costs. It\u2019s definitely good experience. I did a urop second year, then did an internship abroad then a PhD in the same area and I found the urop was a big part of starting that. But you are free to chose a urop in anything and move to something else. Definitely worth doing if you are interested in research as it\u2019s a first introduction to managing a research project. You can also get extra credit for doing the project if you write a report and present a poster.",

I'm interested in quantum computing so I was thinking of applying for a research internship in UC berkley or something, I'm not sure how strong imperial's research is in that. But again, I'll be doing undergrad so I'll be open to a lot of different topics, as I should be. The funding thing is because costs of living in london is so high and I'm an international student from India, so it's already so expensive, I thought I could save some costs here along with a good research experience. Is it possible to work part time jobs along with your UROP? How intensive is it? \n\nSorry for so many questions.",

It\u2019s unusual to do a urop in an area you go on to do a PhD or masters project in but I did it that way. The more important thing about a urop is the experience of research and project management rather than the topic. Funding varies by department but usually there\u2019s maybe 10-15 places per department that you have to apply for, they come from various sponsors and some departments may have more. There\u2019s no rules or anything about having a part time job but the strictness will vary from supervisor to supervisor, most supervisors I\u2019ve talked to are happy for extra help and are happy to help you get the extra credit even if you aren\u2019t funded. It\u2019s possible some supervisors may say it\u2019s not worth it part time if the project is intensive. As for comparing research imperial is a top world institution in every department and the research quality is good across the board generally but it\u2019s a good idea to go abroad to see new labs and experience other universities, it\u2019s very strong in your CV. Personally I have 2 urop students this summer and they will build ultrafast photodetectors and try and get some measurements, if they manage it it\u2019s great if they don\u2019t it\u2019s not the end of the world.",

On top of that, if you're really interested it is very possible to do a urop during term, it's just not particularly common and you won't get funding",

The task will probably be quite small, especially in 1st year, but it's still a great opportunity imo.\n\nPersonally with my urop it required material from a 2nd year course, and then went into specialised detail in the subject area after that, so I had to mostly self teach all of that.\n\nYou typically work for 9-12 weeks over summer.\n\nAnother thing to note is that, especially as a physics student, you can do a urop in any department! It's not a locked-in program. \n\nOne final point would be that the chances of getting paid to do this as a first year are relatively low via the urop bursary scheme. You can also be funded through other avenues, including the academics personal funding account, but there's a good chance you will be working for free.\n\nCan I ask if you know what areas you may be interested in?",

I'm willing to explore and learn new things though!\n\nIn terms of non-physics areas, I worked on a neural network project in my 11th grade, so AI and ML is something I find cool to work on. Perhaps using ML techniques on astrophysical data would be a good project?\n\nI suppose, the workload for the UROP will also be less for the first year then and I'll be able to work part-time (about 20 hours/week) and be able to pay off my rents and stuff hopefully? Gotta plan this properly because london is a bit expensive.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I was applying to the above mentioned courses (MSc AI and MSc Adv Computing), but I am not sure, which one should I keep as the 1st preference\n\nI am wondering if anyone can provide me with some insight into which program would be better for me, both in terms of employment and long-term career prospects. \n\nI am interested in working in the tech industry. I also want to know what is the current hiring scenario in London regarding these fields and career opportunities (SWE vs ML)",

However I enjoyed working as a SWE, so that is still not off the table for me. I decided to apply for Advanced Computing over the MSc AI because it seemed a lot less restrictive and it still allows you to choose all of the ML subjects. And I am an advanced computing offer holder now :)",

    "postText": "I'm in sixth form and I have offers for UCL and Imperial biomed (same grade offer - AAA for both courses). I am really torn on which one to firm. I've heard that imperial has a better rep, especially if I want to work outside of research e.g. in finance etc. I've also heard rumors about imperial having a terrible social scene and that everyone is very studious and doesn't really go out. Could someone please tell me whether this is true? Uni social life is something which I value quite highly and I don't want to end up somewhere where I'll be miserable for 3 years.",

Personally, I'm not very social and a lot of other people become less social during exams, but there are definitely people who go out.\n\nThere are also hundreds of socieities for different things you can try, from tabletop games and esports to debating societies.",

Imperial biomed is pretty weird,  there are no lectures, instead they provide you with e-modules which is p sad honestly. Like u probably only have 5 hours per week of in-person stuff. Idk if they have changed the teaching methods or if will change it so do double-check.",

            "comment": "I likewise had offers from both UCL and Imperial (Elec Eng). Imperial probably slightly stronger academically, but at the time (ages ago), it was 7:1 men/women for Engineering at Imperial, and 15:1 in Elec Eng. UCL Engineering was only a bit better, but the gender mix for the University as a whole was much more balanced. Likewise the mix of subjects. I went to UCL, and FWIW, I got engaged to a fellow-student (medic) in my final year, and we're still married 34 years later.\n\nI had Imperial friends at the time, many of whom I'm still connected to. They also had active social lives, and I'm sure that continues to be the case. As other commenters have said, a lot is down to what social groups you choose to pursue. One of the features of going to any London college is the huge range of social activities available, both on- and off-campus. Inter-collegiate halls are a great way of broadening out your social circle, for example. \n\nLatest Imperial gender mix figures here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial\\_College\\_London#:\\~:text=32%25%20of%20all%20full%2Dtime,higher%20in%20some%20engineering%20courses.",

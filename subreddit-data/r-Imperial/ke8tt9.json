    "postText": "So, for starter's, I've sent my application to Imperial for Biomedical engineering on Oct 15, about 2 months before. I've received no official email from them (except an auto mail that recognized my application). So I've not received anything about an interview. Firstly, is this normal? And, secondly how do I contact them?\nI've tried on engineering.admissions@imperial.ac.uk twice but have gotten no response from them at all. \nAny idea how to contact them, and why am I not being updated? Any way to contact (I'm international)?",

I don't even know if they've figured out how they're gonna do the interviews this year because of corona so don't stress too much about it, they're probably behind schedule compared to previous years.",

I've applied for computing 2 weeks before October 15 and last I heard from them was beginning of November/end of October when I had to do a 40min entrance exam (but even for this people did it on different days). Otherwise, I think they are waiting until January once most people have applied because currently it's really only been Oxbridge applicants who have sent in their UCAS. As long as you got that auto reply it means they have ur application so you don't have to worry.\n\nIf I were you, I would only worry if you havent heard back from them in January. Then you should ask this question again and see if anyone is getting replies.",

My interview contained graph sketching of weird functions you do not see often and also asked me to explain what theory of physics does the heartbeat monitor sensor utilises, where my answer was that it uses the theory of discrete absorption/emission spectrum of electromagnetic waves to monitor blood flow(haemoglobin concentration determines the resultant spectrum), and what digital/analogue components are embedded within a simple interactive christmas card product the interviewer showed to me. It even went further into how CPUs operate, but that was just because I loved to talk about stuff like that. \n\nAfter my interview, the professor said: \"Welcome to Imperial\". My interview was also quite belated, so if you are successful after one belated interview, he/she would usually give you a verbal offer before an official one. \n\nTL;DR : You need math and physics knowledge to excel in interviews.",

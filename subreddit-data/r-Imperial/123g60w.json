Really appreciate any answers, especially from redditors who've been thru it :)",

            "comment": "Most courses have course notes written by the lecturers for that particular course and are handed out at the beginning of the year, so I can\u2019t send you anything. The first year is for the most part revision of math and mechanics from A levels. I don\u2019t think I heard of anyone doing prep for first year, especially since for the first week / month everyone gets smashed drinking anyways. If you do want to do something, look up a thing called Solidworks, it\u2019s the software we use for designing in 3D and you will have assignments on it early on. Solidworks is a paid software which might have free licenses (I don\u2019t remember) but a free alternative such as fusion360 might also help to get you started.",

Then draw a new sketch on a face of that block and cut a hole through it.\nRemember where the buttons are, maybe even the keyboard shortcuts if you like them.\nIf you can memorise that then you'll know your way around the software well enough to start that course with some confidence rather than anxiety.",

            "comment": "Do a few targeted bits of prep before if you like, to feel confident, but don't stress yourself out. It's more important to just work in the library during term time. \n\nSolidWorks is a great shout as mentioned elsewhere.\nStroud maths textbook is a go ood idea too, but that book is thiccc so just focus on a chapter or two. I found the mathematics the hardest part of the course (particularly integration and Laplace transforms), so maybe focus on that?\n\nGet yourself a good set of earphones/headphones to help you study. \n\nBuy your textbooks second hand rather than new. Try Alibris, Abebooks or the student book fair (if they run one).\n\nWhen working through lecturer course notes... If you get stuck then first just try your best to figure it out. Then ask your friends. Then don't be afraid to take specific queries to the lecturers themselves during their open office hours. This is what you are paying the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 for and they'll normally be friendly.\n\nMore general advice from my memories of starting a MEng at Warwick back in 2006:\n\nTry to start assignments as soon as you get them, otherwise you'll be pulling all-nighters. Easier said than done! Imperial has a higher workload than Warwick so best to stay on the front foot.\n\nYou're about to enter the most sociable time of your life and those friendships will carry you through your course. So look at that as a great opportunity and enjoy it. Just be open, positive and approachable, and say yes to everything that you have time for.\nIf you like to get smashed (like I do) then always drink a water every time you drink a beer - then you'll wake up less hungover and more able to function/study/smile.\nAnd if you can't dance then YouTube is really great for learning the basics.\n\nMemorise (or write down) two or three cheap and tasty recipes. Cook in batches and freeze portions. \n\nYou're going to have a great time!",

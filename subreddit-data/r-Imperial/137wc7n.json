    "postText": "Hi. I got an offer from physics department of 776 in maths, physics and computer science HL, and 42 overall. I think I will be able to meet HL conditionals, but I think that I may not be able to meet overall 42 and miss it by one or two points.\n\nI saw past offers and typical IB offer before the pandemic and the whole crazy IB inflation thing was 40\\~41. IB said that they will try to award IB grades similar to pre-pandemic level, so I am assuming that average IB grade will drop. So if overall IB grades drop, will there be a chance that they will accept some students that did not meet conditionals? And also, I've heard that this depends on the department on whether they accept an applicant that didn't meet conditionals. How lenient is the physics department?",

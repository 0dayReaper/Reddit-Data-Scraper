I was asked a question to graph the function sinc x and a question about electric fields. It is okay if you don't know the answer, they are looking to understand your thought process and how you work through a problem. Don't be afraid to ask any questions you have.\n\nAlso go through your personal statement line by line because they WILL ask you questions about whatever you wrote",

            "comment": "I had my interview for EEE last year, and the other comments seem to cover it pretty well... They did ask me the standard \"Why this course?\" question, and he went over parts of my application ( I had a pretty long internship, and he quickly me about that too).\n\nWhat I hope to be more helpful with is that I remember all the exact problems I got given so here it goes:\n\n1. Integrate x^(3) . sinx\n2. Integrate x^(n) . sinx\n3. You are given three black boxes. You know that one contains a resistor, one contains a capacitor, and one contains an inductor.  How can you tell which is which if you also have access to a battery,  another resistor, and a voltmeter?\n\nThhe first question is just repeated integration by parts (hopefully pretty straightforward).\n\nThe second q. is still integration by parts, but if you name the original integral I(n) and do two consecutive steps of integration by parts you will notice that you get:\n\nI(n) = ... + ... + integral of x^(n-2) . sinx\n\ni.e. I(n) = ... + ... + I(n-2)\n\nThese are called Integral Recurrence Relations, and there's plenty of material online if you haven't seen them before.\n\n3. This question essentially asks if you understand transients, a.k.a. capacitor/inductor charging and discharging...\n\nThe quick answer here is that you take the extra resistor and connect one of the black boxes in series with it. You then connect the battery and measure the voltage across the black box.\n\nIf you measure constant voltage -&gt; the black box is a resistor ( you've made a potential divider)\n\nIf the voltage increases with time -&gt; the black box is a capacitor ( charging capacitor through resistor)\n\nAnd finally if the voltage decreases with time -&gt; the black box is an inductor...\n\n(Before answering I asked if I could assume that the values of the components are such that I would see the voltage increasing when just using a voltmeter, to which he answered yes. )\n\nAfter that he asked me to sketch the graphs of Voltage and Current through the black boxes as a function of time. He didn't make me write or derive actual equations it was just descriptive...\n\nI hope these help you to prepare!\n\nOverall, I can say that most of the interviewers are very nice people ( they are mostly lecturers from first year modules, so I've met all of them now...) and you shouldn't be worried too much, cuz even if you get stuck a bit, they will most likely give you a hint and try to help you out.\n\nI initially didn't get what he wanted me to do in question 2. but he gave me a few slight pushes in the correct direction, and didn't seem to mind that it took me a few seconds to realize what the question was hahah.\n\nGood luck, I hope to see you in EEE/EIE next year :D",

            "comment": "I study EIE, but my interview was originally for EEE so I can provide some input (tbh, the interviews are nearly the same in terms of content, in part because of the fact that you do exactly the same modules in first yr).\n\nSo my first question was a Maths based question, it's not something immensely difficult, it's something that requires an A Level amount of knowledge to answer but it was something you'd see in maybe the harder sections of the exercises in the exercise book. I was given a trig function and was asked \"what is the 97th derivative of this?\", the trick was that if you differentiate a couple of times, you'll find that it's periodic and that you can just use this to deduce what the 97th one is, by the period.\n\nThe second question I got was another maths based one, and that was to perform an Integration by parts that took multiple iterations to do, and the trick was to notice that you can rewrite the integral in terms of itself. Again something quite A Level-y, but not something you can just bang out straight from the off.\n\nThe next question was to draw various trig functions, some including absolute signs, floor function signs and also superpositions of them. These aren't bad to do if you piece it together step by step, they're happy to give hints and let you have some breathing space to figure it out.\n\nMy last questions were questions to do with things I mentioned on my personal statement, I did research into some Millenium problems and also into the Fourier Transform's physical applications, so just a few questions there about what I learned and how I apply it.\n\nBasically, the interview took the same format for more or less everyone, just different formats or weightings. I got more maths based questions, by using my PS to my advantage (My PS had lots of maths/computing based content in it but very little physics). However I have known people that have done the opposite and had more Physics-y based PS', and received questions more like circuits, electromagnetism and fields, basic electricity knowledge and things like waves also came up quite a bit. Even if they don't ask you many questions about things you wrote on your PS, the theme and format of the questions you receive may be corresponding with the general vibe of your PS, i.e if it's mathsy, you'll get more mathsy questions, if it's Physicsy, the latter, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\n1) You'll get a general Maths/Physics/Mechanics question that is mostly A Level based, but requires some thought into it.\n\n2) You'll get another one of the above topics in a more thought-provoking question but still one that you can answer.\n\n3) You'll either get another quick question, or you'll get some questions about stuff you mentioned on your PS.\n\nThis is the general format, you may get loads of questions and no PS ones, or the latter, it really depends on your interviewer and how he feels that day really.\n\nUltimately the main point is, don't worry! I know people who couldn't even answer the first question and still got in (and are doing much better than me who did answer them), and vice versa, they don't care about the correctness of your answer per se; it's nice, but ultimately they care more about your thought process and how you take a problem from conception to solution, because that's ultimately the main factor that underpins Engineering at Imperial, talk! Don't freeze up or try to do things mentally, they will like it a lot more if you explain your processes and what you're trying to calculate, why you're trying to calculate it, etc, even if it's wrong, please make sure to talk. I'm sure you'll do great :)), if you have any further questions feel free to PM me.",

            "comment": "My interview was a) several years ago b) for EIE, so might not be the most useful. But from memory I had one long technical question that developed and questions about my Personal Statement\n\nThe technical question started with being asked how much water my phone would boil if I dropped the battery in water. I did some very basic back of the envelope calculations based on the energy stored in the battery (back when I had a phone I could actually get the battery out and read the specs on the side). This then lead onto a conversation about what causes phones to use power, and I think from there a discussion about transistors.\n\nThis question was substantially less maths focused than most other people I've asked, but questions *really* vary by who takes them. All questions you will be asked will be about how you think. When I gave my answer I made sure to explain why I was doing something, why I was calculating something, and so on.\n\nI then had questions about my personal statement, and about why I wanted to study engineering, which I think are pretty common things you should prepare for.\n\nI was then asked if I had any questions, which I did. I think that you should definitely prepare some to ask as it makes you look interested. I asked about the difference between EEE/EIE as they were very different 5 years ago, but it is still probably a good question to ask as it shows interest in what teaching is like.",

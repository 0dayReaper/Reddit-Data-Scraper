            "comment": "Best hall by far imo. There's a corridor linking all the kitchens in the houses so there's no division by floor etc. that you find in the other halls which makes it really easy to socialise with people from other houses. \n\nOtherwise if you're in the annexe there's a giant shared kitchen so you'll easily meet people there. This was also where I ended up going for pres usually as I made a lot of friends from the annexe, and you could easily fit 20+ people around the tables in there.\n\nPurely because of proximity you'll easily make friends in your own kitchen, though for me they didn't really form my core social group. I happily spent hours chatting to my housemates, but I made other friends through my course (we'd walk to lectures in the morning) and in particular, through the study room. The study rooms are great places to hang out, because you can chat to whoever else is there and if there's a lull you can go back to doing some problem sheets etc. From there you can also hear what other people's plans are and join in if you like.\n\nThere are also things like Sunday breakfast where you can talk to people. I had a friend who I would rarely bump into during the week because she was always in the library, and didn't come on nights out, but we'd usually catch up for a bit during these breakfasts.\n\nThese are kind of scattered points, and I'm happy to give more specific answers, but I was there in 2018/19 and absolutely loved every minute of it.",

I think I made it from my kitchen to Her Majesty's Theatre in the West end in about 13 minutes flat, and only missed the first song.",

I really don\u2019t know what that means since aren\u2019t drugs banned everywhere? \nSomething else I wanted to ask is about pregame. Are you allowed to drink outside of your room in common rooms?",

Quite a few smokers and weed smokers in my time, theres an internal courtyard where you could get away with smoking.\n\nIts the best hall balancing cost and distance, highly recommend.",

Very social vibe in the standard rooms bit (not annexe) because all the kitchens are on the same floor so u can always kitchen-hop and look for people! My main advice is don\u2019t limit yourself to one friendship group and attend as much stuff as possible. If anyone has any questions I\u2019m happy to answer if you PM!! Have funnn!",

    "postText": "I applied for maths PhD. One of my ref's clicked submit on the portal before attaching the letter. He said he emailed 'them' to explain and attached the letter, however now I'm worried. My application also doesnt have an application number on the portal for some reason, I emailed maths phd enquiries and natural sciences admissions but I doubt they will respond or even see the mail. Also the supervisor of the PhD said the refs are helpful in their selection process. I got an email to say my app has been sent to the department now but I am stressed cos I have to chase this up now and I don't really know who to contact to see if my ref has been received. the telephones are out of service too. please advise.",

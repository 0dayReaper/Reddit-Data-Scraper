    "postText": "Okay so I'm in Year 13 and I'm doing Maths, Further Maths, Chemistry and Physics. I received my predicted grades on Sunday and was predicted A\\* for all subjects. I am aiming to apply to Unis like UCL, Imperial and Cambridge. However, I am lowkey worried whether this may inflate my conditional offers. For e.g. the typical offers at Imperial for Engineering are A\\* A\\* A. But will the fact that I'm predicted all A\\* mean the offer I will get from Imperial will also be A\\* A\\* A\\* (higher than the typical offer)? I would really appreciate if people who got similar predicted grades and were probably in the same dilemma to respond to this.",

What they might do though is give you a harder offer than people doing 3 A-levels, I.e. they may want 4 A grades or better (B maybe for one). So, my offer for physics required that I got an A in my 4th subject which was German, even though it was irrelevant to the course. This could happen but obviously if you're predicted A\\*A\\*A\\*A\\* then you're capable of attaining any offer they throw at you, so I wouldn't worry about it.",

They don't inflate unless you did quite bad in your interview, most offers seem to vary between either the website listed requirement, one grade higher or sometimes even one grade lower, depending on other conditions.",

Though he achieved all A*, but his predicted did not increase his offer.",

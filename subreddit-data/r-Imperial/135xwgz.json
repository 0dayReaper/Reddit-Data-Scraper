    "postText": "I guess apart from the budget, the real question I am struggling with is what would be the best option for oneself?\n\n\n(i) Gradpad (recommended by Imperial) and be surrounded by your imperial cohort. All bills included. Kinda far but not really. Average pricing.\n\n(ii) Other student accomodations like Chapter Properties, iQ properties, Ravenscourt etc. Kinda expensive. Mix of postgrads, undergrads from other uni which in a way would be nice also.\n\n\n(iii) Looking to share a flat 1-2 months before arriving.\n\nSo what is everyone doing - and if there are current students + alumni wandering this subbreddit, what would you recommend?",

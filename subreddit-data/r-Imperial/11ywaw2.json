    "postText": "So I was rejected for biochem on Sunday, no reason given. My predicted grades are A\\*A\\*A in Biology, Chemistry, and Philosophy.\n\nHowever, I qualify for widening participation, and according to the Imperial website such applicants to the department of Life Sciences who meet the minimum entry standard of AAA will receive guaranteed offers.\n\nI'm slightly confused and wanted to know what the reason for this could be? Am I missing something here? I've emailed admissions but they haven't replied yet. Any help would be much appreciated!",

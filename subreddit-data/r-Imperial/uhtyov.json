You get all kinds of people at Imperial. You just have to find your crowd. Clubs/societies/sports help here.\nNightlife - yes, expensive, but so are most UK cities these days. You just have to know where to go",

You\u2019ll have as much fun as people from other unis, but it mostly depends on what course you do and who you\u2019re friends with.\n\nNightlife is the same no matter which uni you go to in london lol.",

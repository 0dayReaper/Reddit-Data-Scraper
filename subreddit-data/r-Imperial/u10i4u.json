    "postText": "I was offered on condition of both 7s in IB Physics and Maths AAHL, as well as a total of 40 out of 45 points.  EEE BEng.\n\nThat would be a relatively smooth sail if I could attend my exams, but due to some sudden lockdown in my city, exams are diminishingly likely to happen (we don't know when it'll end, but likely not before the exams).\n\nThis screws up my maths score because IB grades us differently if we miss exams; without an exam, they'll refer to past quizzes and our written IAs (pieces of investigation reports and commentaries) and assign marks.\n\nIB allocates a 30% quota on our cohort of Math AAHL students who can get a 7, others get 6s and 5s; even though our historic maths exam scores show approximately 80% of the students getting a 7.\n\nI lie awkwardly in that gap between the 30% and 80% range, where I'm no top student in class, but I still get stably high marks with written exams (which is probably not going to happen). I skimped on my maths IA because I thought it would be a bad investment of time and effort (low score weight if exams happen) and focused on exam prep.\n\nTLDR This means I have a rather small chance of getting a 7 in the end because I foolishly assumed there can't be a lockdown during my exams season.\n\nShould I communicate my concerns with imperial admissions early on, or should I wait until late July, when my scores are finalized, and if I didn't meet the conditions, then talk with them? Either way I feel it's making drama and I don't want to do that.\n\nThanks for reading my issue.",

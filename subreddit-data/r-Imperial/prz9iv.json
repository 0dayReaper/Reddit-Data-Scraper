I would then rush to take the tube.\n\nYou can take 45(if I remember) from white City station and it stops at queen's terrace\n\nEdit: from personal experience I would suggest to take central line all the way to Hyde park(Queensway) as circle line transfer sucks at Notting hill and Queensway just the next stop in central line.",

    "postText": "Hi there,\nI will be applying for EEE master's this year. I am considering the Analogue and Digital Integrated Circuit Design program. What GPA do I need to get accepted? I know I need a minimum of 3.00/4.00, but this is just the minimum. Do you think a GPA of around 3.70/4.00 would be enough?\nThank you.",

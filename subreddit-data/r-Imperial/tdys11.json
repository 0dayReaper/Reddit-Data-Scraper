    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nGot accepted into an Msc in Advanced Computing for a place in fall 2022. However, due to difficult financial and personal circumstances, I am contemplating to defer my place for the next academic year. How early can I ask for deferal, and if it is possible, how likely is the department willing to accept my request?  \n\n\nAny indication would be helpful",

That being said, I don't see why they wouldn't believe you. Have a chat with them, and see what they say. I hope it goes well!",

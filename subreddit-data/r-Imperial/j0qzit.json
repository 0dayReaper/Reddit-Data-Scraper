    "postText": "I'm an 11th grader in the US, and Imperial is my top choice in the UK. I have completed two AP exams last year (Calculus AB and Computer Science A) and scored 5s on both of them. I'm planning to give 4 more AP exams this year (Calculus BC, Computer Science Principles, Physics 1, Statistics). Assuming I somehow manage 5s on all of them, is it possible that I get an unconditional offer from Imperial?\n\nBased on my understanding, Imperial requires three 5s on AP exams. But I'm guessing their actual requirements are much more.\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "American guy here,\n\nSo first off I assume you're applying for Computing? If not check the course page for the specific AP requirements.\n\nSo yeah you'll need 5's and really nothing less. They will probably ask for a specific subject or 2. One of them will definitely be Calc BC (not AB) so work on that. Also a complete side note but make sure for junior and senior year you have at least a B in English as this is your English language requirement. If not you can take some exams like the TOFUL if you need to. It's just to make sure you can speak English so don't stress.\n\nYou're going to need to really work on your interview. It's much harder than in the US and you need to prepare for it. It's much more similar to a job interview. You will be asked to complete mathematical problems as well as other problems that could relate to problem solving or your course. They are assessing a) your ability in the subject you've applied for and b) your \"teachability\".\n\nThe last thing you'll need is your extra curricular which are what really sets you apart. FIRST robotics is a really good one if you do it. But really anything relating to your subject are good. They'll like it if you so things like debate and sports  which are quite common but you need to have extra curricular relating to your subject. Also if you really want to confirm your place you should consider maybe doing like a personal project that relates to your subject. Through these you're trying to show your commitment and passion to the subject.\n\nDM or reply for extra info\n\nEdit: last thing regarding number of AP's. Three is good, your condition will rarely ask for 4 exams but 3 is a good number. Just make sure to keep in mind that quality is better than quantity.",

                    "comment": "Thanks, I really appreciate the reply. Yes, I will be doing Computer Science. I'm going to try hard to get that 5 on Calculus BC.\n\nSo for the English requirement, I've done IGCSE Literature (scored an A) and Language (A*), and also the SAT where I hope I'll get a good score (results coming next week). Do yout think this will suffice? I mean I'm positive I'll get atleast a B in English this year and the next, but I am a bit curious.\n\nFor extracurriculars, I have a Github with many projects, a short internship and ive been volunteering to build websites for non-profits off late. Those are my only major-related ECs. Do you think these are okay? I understand that they are nothing special, which is why I'm asking. \n\nOnce again, I really appreciate the answer and the help. Have a great day!",

You can check the language requirement on the Imperial website but A/A* seems more than alright\n\nYeah the GitHub stuff sounds cool and the website stuff sounds even better. Just make sure that A you have something to show. Imagine you have 30 seconds to present a project you've done. You want something you can hold/show to the interviewer and say \"this is mine, I did it and here is how I did it.\" If you've done that and you're going into junior year you're definitely good. Just keep it up and try to keep stepping up for each project. Maybe I would also add try to show variety, so maybe some hardware coding maybe some other projects.\n\nA friend of mine coded a game of chess, then created a machine learning algorithm in order for the computer to learn how to play chess (it wasn't very good at playing chess but it worked). This is what you would definatly call an \"above and beyond\" project but if you want to 100% go to IC this will be a big help. \n\nI guess in summary just make sure you have plenty of fool projects you've done but for at least 1 of them make sure it has an extra wow factor",

I remember talking to a kid with 10 aps all 5s going to imperial mech eng this year. So unless you mess up your interview you kight even get an offer without STEP. Im not so sure though.\n\nGood luck.",

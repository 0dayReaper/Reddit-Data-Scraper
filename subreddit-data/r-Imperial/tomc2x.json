    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI currently have an offer from UCL (MSc Machine Learning) and still waiting for Imperial (MSc Computing (AI&amp;ML)). My first option was UCL, because the programme seems to fit me best, but I would like to know your opinion if someone here is currently coursing the Imperial one.\n\nAlso, a more general question, are Imperial classes still online or have they returned to pre-Covid state? This is also an important matter for me, as I don't want to pay high international fees if classes are going to be online... \n\nAny info would be very appreciated! :)",

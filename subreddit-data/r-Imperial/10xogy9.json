    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have finished my bachelors from one of the top universities in the US. I have received an acceptance from both Camb and Imp for Masters (research based programs). **I don't have a preference for the location** because I don't mind the college campus vibe as opposed to living in London.\n\nMost posts I see are about the difference in bachelors at both places, but I want to know more about job prospects. If I do research based programs **(MPhil in Eng at Cambridge vs MSc in Adv MechE at Imperial)** and want to ultimately **work in the industry** or in the research field (definitely want to stay away from academia), what course should I choose??\n\nI have a small bias towards Cambridge because its CAMBRIDGE **but are job prospects going to differ a lot**??? Please help!! Thanks.",

As much as degrees are somewhat of a means to an end, it's also months/ years of your life and you'd rather spend it doing what interests you. \n\nIf there's not much difference between the courses in terms of content, then maybe others can comment more on job prospects etc.",

            "comment": "MPhil sounds more research oriented, perhaps more like a good preparation for a PhD, whereas a MSc may be more appreciated in industry, particularly if your target job is directly related to Mech Eng (vs general engineering). In terms of employment I\u2019m pretty sure they are both the same, but Mech Eng isn\u2019t my field.",

            "comment": "Sounds like most important factor for you is job prospects and this really depends on where you want to work and what you want to do.\n\nImperial is weird because in the UK it has the highest graduate prospects in the UK. All my friends who went there coasted in to jobs in whatever field they wanted (top investment banks, consulting, biotech, PhD programs etc). I work pretty closely with MBB consultants for example, who tell me that they recruit their \u201ctop bucket\u201d applicants from Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial and LSE. \n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s indisputable that Cambridge is a better known brand around the world. Given that you went to a top US university though, this may not be an issue for you. I now live in the US and I can safely say that the Americans will still value their own colleges above any in the UK. But Cambridge will be better known than Imperial in non-academic settings in the US. \n\nAlso depends on field - for Mechanical Engineering jobs, I\u2019ve been told that Imperial and Cambridge are completely equivalent for job prospects, the departments and teaching are equally highly regarded. \n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either! Choose what works best for your career plans and which course you think you\u2019ll enjoy more. Congrats!",

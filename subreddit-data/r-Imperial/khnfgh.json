    "postText": "im in my final year (maths) and taking eight pure modules, it seems like if you aren't revising the four modules you've learnt over the oct-dec period throughout the year the time between mid march and your first exam will not be enough to revise all the material for all eight modules (at least for pure, there are a ton of subtleties/formulas that you will more than likely not remember while learning your four new modules) . Is this what most people do? Revise their term 1 modules throughout term 2?",

I agree - it feels like if I didn't do this the risk of basically having to do more 're-learning' than 'revising' closer to exams would be so much higher! Have you had success with finding time to go over term 1 stuff during term 2? (I guess it should be doable as long as you keep up with problem sheets/lectures)",

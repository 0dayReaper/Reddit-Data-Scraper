    "postText": "Hey, so I'm an international student who applied to imperial back in November. I did the interview and was offered a place for earth and planetary science, which was the course I planned on studying originally.\n\nI've always been interested in physics, chemistry and math, especially physics. When I was looking up courses, I thought earth and planetary science at imperial was the right one for me, as it's an interdisciplinary course that touches on all of my interests. However after I applied, I had a research opportunity that made me realize what I was really interested in was actually physics. Plus, a degree in physics will also give me a stronger foundation for what I plan to do in the future.\n\nNow I'm afraid that I made the wrong choice by applying to the earth and planetary science course. I mean...I guess I could still go to that course in the fall if I meet my conditions, but a part of me will always think that I should've applied to the Physics course instead. The tuition is very expensive, so I guess I want to be sure the course I'm doing is what I'm interested in.\n\nIs it possible to change to a course in another department at imperial after results day (providing that I meet the conditions of the other course)? I'm doing the IB diploma and will likely achieve 42+ (HL math AA, physics chem 677) based on my predicted grades. But I've heard that it depends on the spots available for that course, has anyone successfully changed courses? Or should I take a gap year and apply again next year? Need some advice, thanks!:)",

            "comment": "So short answer:\n\nIt's not really possible to change programs in the application stage, but once you're in the college, you can transfer courses, the only downsides are you'll a) need to seek approval from the new department, so it's not a guarantee, b) need to finish with at least a 2:1 at the end of your first year, and c) repeat your first year next year.\n\nBut definitely keep in mind that all programs at Imperial are very high quality and fun, so even if now it seems like you made a bit of a wrong choice, almost always it works out.",

There\u2019s actually someone in my year who transferred to Physics after first year, but I heard he had to redo the admissions process from scratch. Try emailing the Physics department to ask if this is possible (they might say no but it doesn\u2019t hurt to try) as well as the Earth Science department who will be happy to help and give some advice if you\u2019re unsure",

You mentioned you were confident of achieving your grades but one of my biggest concerns is that I'll miss my offer due to bad PGs or loss of learning because of online classes.",

I'm not too sure about the non-exam route though.",

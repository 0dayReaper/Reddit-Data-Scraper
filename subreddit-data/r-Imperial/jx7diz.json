    "postText": "I made a post on r/chanceme, but I figured that it would be appropriate to make one here too. I'm coming from the US and I was wondering if anyone could possibly provide some advice. I'm thinking about either applying to the BEng in Math and Computer Science or the MEng in Math and Computer Science. Would applying to the MEng potentially increase my chances since it shows that I'm more devoted? Here's the rest of the info that I provided on that post:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently a junior so some of this is speculative, however, my actual stats should look very similar when I actually apply\n\n**Demographics:** Male, Caucasian, USA, FL, choice school\n\n**Intended Major(s):** Math and Computer Science\n\n**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 1550 SAT (780 Math and 770 English); 800 Math II, 800 Physics\n\n**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 3.9 UW and 5.0/6.0 W\n\n**Coursework:**\n\n* AP Classes\n\n1.

Discrete Math\n\n**Awards:** Qualified/placed at a few debate tournaments. And also placed at my state science fair\n\n**Extracurriculars:**\n\n* Debate - Debate captain for sophomore and junior year, and vice president senior year\n* CS Club - Tutoring and Competitions\n* NHS - Part of the tutoring committee\n* ML Science Fair Project\n\n**Essays/LORs/Other:**  Strong LORs from my AP CS A teacher, DE professor, AP Gov/APUSH teacher, and counselor.\n\n**Schools:**  I would really like to study in the UK, however I am considering some US schools\n\n* UK:\n\n1. Cambridge\n2. Imperial College\n3. UCL\n4. Warwick\n5. Lancaster\n\n* US\n\n1. Carnegie Mellon\n2. UC Berkeley\n3. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n4. Purdue\n5. Stony Brook\n6. UF\n7. (any other schools that you think might be worthwhile)\n\nWould  I have a good chance at any UK unis? I'm thinking that I would have a  pretty decent chance at the imperial college, so if anyone could verify  this it would be appreciated.",

I was so shocked when I came to the country of London where everyone spoke funny American. There are no frats which was a buzzer, and now there ain't any hunnies ether cuz of covid.

I\u2019m not even a student here and I know this. The universities you mention have been around for centuries and have been romanticised in TV etc. during that time, while Imperial has only become a top 5/10 university in the world recently. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the average Joe in America who doesn\u2019t know anything about unis wasn\u2019t too familiar with it, because Americans aren\u2019t too familiar with schools outside American anyway, but in the world of academia it\u2019s one of the first names in people\u2019s heads. That\u2019s what matters",

We were discussing Imperial\u2019s reputation in academia.\n\nYour point about Silicon Valley is wrong. Every major tech company in Silicon Valley has heard of Imperial, it\u2019s internationally famous as one of the best universities for computing in the world and it would not be hard for an Imperial graduate to find employment there. I have relatives that work in Silicon Valley and they know this.\n\nYour point about reputation within academia is also wrong. As I said, my family are top academics. Imperial is ultra-famous in the world of academia and many consider it higher than Oxbridge. Imperial\u2019s research is better than Oxbridge\u2019s and is famous even outside of academia. The research is always in the news and **President Donald Trump** himself even referred to Imperial College multiple times in his press conferences, and **President Joe Biden** opened Imperial\u2019s new cancer research centre. There\u2019s a reason so many Oxbridge professors go to Imperial. \n\nThe reason so many offer holders don\u2019t go is because they missed the offer lol - they set high conditions for a reason. There are a sizeable number of people who choose Imperial over Oxbridge, and people that end up at Oxbridge because they put Imperial first and missed the offer (I know people this has happened to). Even Cambridge undergrads themselves (including myself) recognise that there is no difference between Cambridge and Imperial for computing. You seem to forget that there are ***International Olympiad*** students at Imperial.\n\nYou\u2019re not basing your points off anything other than your own assumptions, which are incorrect. I don\u2019t understand why.",

Have you forgotten that there are International Maths Olympiad/IOI/International Astronomy Olympiad Students at Imperial?\n\nYou also fail to mention that the CS offer for Imperial includes a STEP requirement as well as A\\*A\\*AA grades. Again, there are literally students here at Cambridge that have ended up here because they have missed the Imperial offer.\n\nI am a dual US UK citizen enrolled at Cambridge. I know how good Imperial is. All the undergrads and professors here recognise there is no difference between Cambridge and Imperial. It is well known that Imperial students are targeted by international companies. JP Morgan recruiters even have a list of target universities around the world, of which Imperial is one. I have spoken with multiple Silicon Valley representatives when I went to visit MIT, as well as my relatives in Silicon Valley, and they said they all target Cambridge and Imperial students from the UK. Imperial even mention it in their open day talks.\n\nYou call me a fanboy but I am completely impartial. You on the other hand just seem like a hater.

    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm an international student (from a developing asian country) and I'm very excited to have been admitted to imperial for EEE. I have a few other admissions too (CS at the University of Toronto - ranked 11th in the world for cs, and ECE at UIUC in the US - ranked about 25th in the world for ece), and am considering all my options rn. On the other hand, imperial has a rank of 8 for EEE which makes it seem so much cooler.\n\nIn terms of affordability, all these universities have a v similar cost profile, so that isn't an issue. I was hoping some students could help me figure out what to do. I do have a few doubts/concerns that I'd want your advice on:\n\n1. I am also interested in computers, and the universities in North America would undoubtedly offer me more flexibility in minoring in CS/ double majoring EECS style. On reading more, I've found that imperial does not have minors/double majors. As such, is there still scope for flexibility for me to also work on my education in CS where my taking of relevant courses will be acknowledged formally?\n2. Secondly, employability is a very important factor for me. Going for international education is an immense financial cost for my family, and it is very important for me to get a good job later on. My family and I share the concern that the UK as a county is a bit lacking with respect to jobs and innovation in tech as compared to the US. Could some current students/alumni share their experiences w.r.t employment during and after my degree? Ideally, I want some nice internships on a biannual/annual basis too.\n\nThanks a lot, and excited to see what the future has for me!!!",

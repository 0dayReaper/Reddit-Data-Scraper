            "comment": "I\u2019m currently staying at Kemp Porter, studying biochemistry and honestly the commute is fine. You\u2019ll have to add 40 minutes - 1 hour to your journey time but the commute is really easy and there\u2019s loads of different ways to go - you can take the central line and the circle line and walk 5 minutes from either Gloucester Road or South Kensington, or you can take the central line and walk through Hyde park from Queensway or Lancaster Gate. Both take the same amount of time but the circle line can be unreliable and the walk through Hyde park is really nice. Imo I\u2019d much rather commute than pay the extra for living in South Ken, transport is quite cheap too especially since there\u2019s a bus service too though that takes a bit longer \n\nThere\u2019s a gym in North Acton, about a 2-3 minute walk from KP and it\u2019s \u00a340 per year for a student so don\u2019t worry about not being near a gym\n\nI hope that answers all the questions you had but if you have any more feel free to dm me :)",

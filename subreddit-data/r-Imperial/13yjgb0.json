    "postText": "I'm currently choosing between an undergraduate Chemical Engineering education at Imperial or NUS (National University of Singapore).\n\nI've previously posted this question on NUS's reddit community ([https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/13y53gc/nus\\_or\\_imperial/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/13y53gc/nus_or_imperial/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). Most of the people who commented/upvoted seemed to recommend Imperial. \n\nI just wanted to post this question here to ask for the opinions, advice, and insights of imperial students. I'm thinking that I can be given a glimpse (or detailed glimpse) of the reality of an Imperial degree, life as an Imperial student, and job prospects. \n\nAre there any insights you can provide about the  **quality of education, campus life, job prospects**, or anything else about Imperial College London that could help me make an informed decision? In regards to campus life, can you share some examples of activities regularly organised by societies, sports clubs, and the student union? moreover, how's the job prospects of an international student in the UK and Europe after graduating from imperial? I've heard that it can be difficult for international students.\n\nI look forward to hearing your insights and advice :D. Thank you!",

            "comment": "I have no knowledge of NUS, at all, so I can\u2019t help you on the decision front.\n\nWhat I can say, is I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re supposed to be the best uni in the UK for chem eng (I\u2019m pretty sure, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told anyway lol), meaning that it\u2019s going to be a damn good course, with a damn good reputation. As in, I\u2019m pretty sure our chem eng is supposed to beat out oxbridge, which is pretty hard to do, lol.\n\nA lot of the decision I would have to say, is probably going to be a combination of costs (e.g. if imperial is insanely more expensive, or vice versa), and where you want to be longer term - for example if you do want to be in the UK to work at some point, being at a UK uni will make that much easier. Also time - as you can get a masters degree here in four years, as opposed to six in most of the rest of the world. No clue about NUS tho!\n\nI can\u2019t give you too much course info for chem eng though. I\u2019m a normal chemist, not a chemical engineer, and I know nothing about your course, basically. I think a lot of it is plant based, but I have no clue tbh.\n\nCampus life is also somewhat hard to say, because I\u2019m not certain what you mean by it. If you mean \u2018day to day stuff on campus\u2019, then the campus is nice and has decent facilities and whatnot. But we\u2019re not *really* a campus uni. You don\u2019t live on campus - you\u2019ll live in various parts of london. Some near campus, some less so. But the campus is in a very, very central part of london. The experience of living here isn\u2019t as much the experience of \u2018being on campus\u2019 as it is \u2018being a student in london\u2019, because pretty much everything you do other than learning will be *off campus*.\n\nJob prospects wise google will be your friend. Imperial normally has great prospects, but chem eng specifically? No clue, ngl, I\u2019m not in that department lol.\n\nOn the societies front, there\u2019s like three hundred of them, or something. What events they organise are pretty much whatever you want. Be it community baking, sports games, meetups with drinks, cycling trips, hiking trips, climbing trips\u2026 there are enough societies that most things will be somewhere. But they\u2019re all self-managed - I can\u2019t give you anywhere NEAR a comprehensive list. But you can find the society list online, and go \u2018hey that looks cool\u2019 at the list if you want.\n\nThe societies include all the \u2018sports clubs\u2019. They are \u2018sports societies\u2019. There is one for pretty much any relatively major sport you can think of worldwide. They do lots of sports stuff, lol. Depends on the sport. Some will be great, some less so, but can\u2019t be more specific than that really.\n\nAnd workload wise, imperial DOES tend to be a lot.  Lots of work, long hours, and lots of stuff to do. Equally we get decent length breaks off though, and they do try to balance the workload. But pretty much all courses are hard, intensive, and academically rigorous - hence the reputation we have.",

I am thoroughly impressed with how extensive the course content is, it is honestly a step above other undergrad programs. The difficulty matches the prestige.\n-\tThe elective courses in your third/fourth year are ridiculously diverse as well, you will be able to take courses in sustainable energy and CCUS. You can tailor your experience, focusing in either biotechnology, process systems, materials, or a varied mix! You are also allowed to take a few courses from the prestigious Business School, which was fantastic for me.\n-\tLondon life is interesting and eventful, but expensive.\n-\tJob prospects for ChemE in the UK are pretty poor at the moment regardless of university due to supply and demand, but having an Imperial degree can only help.\n\nI don\u2019t know too much about NUS, it is obviously internationally renowned, and probably the best institution in Asia. Their ChemE is also extremely strong, but I think the curriculum is less focused, thus taking longer to do the B.E. Do talk to people from NUS as well to get their opinion (although it seems like they are already advocating for Imperial from your post).",

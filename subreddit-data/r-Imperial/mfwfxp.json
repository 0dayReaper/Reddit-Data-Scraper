    "postText": "Hi, I got two offers from Imperial and Warwick. For Imperial is the MsC Risk Management and Financial Engineering and for Warwick the MsC Finance an Economics with a 9k scholarship (I originally applied to MsC Financial Mathematic but I got this offer). I am not convinced by the Warwick course, but that scholarship tempt me. I want to pursue quantitative roles in finance. Which Uni would you recommend? btw any applicants or offer holders for  MsC Risk Management and Financial Engineering",

            "comment": "I think more importantly it's about which programme fits your specific interests the most. While a scholarship is something great, is that scholarship worth you attending a programme you aren't as excited for? Will it hinder your future opportunities?\n\nOnly you can answer that question. Maybe talking to the current students at each school can be helpful too! I know a lot of those schools have UniBuddy platforms, you can contact them through the school website.",

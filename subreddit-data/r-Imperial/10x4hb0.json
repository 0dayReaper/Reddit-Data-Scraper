    "postText": "The conditional offer for my Master's degree from Imperial College London (ICL) has finally arrived. With a CGPA of 4.68/5, I'm in the last semester of my undergraduate degree. When I finish my bachelor's, ICL expects me to have a CGPA of 4.7/5. I can only do this if I receive all As during my last semester. The problem is that my examiner and supervisor will grade my Final Year Project, which is worth a lot of academic units this semester, and I have no idea what grade I will receive.\n\nHas anyone received a similar offer like this before? How stringent is the conditional offer policy at the school? Will they still consider it if, for example, I fall just short of the requirement?",

            "comment": "I cannot directly help with this but it will greatly help if you specify the program you are considering, some are more competitive or lenient than others. In general though, as a tip, if you let your supervisor know of your offer (but not directly and if he is not a bellend) then he might bump you up to help you make your offer.",

    "postText": "Hi there! I recently accepted an offer for Chemistry, and I heard that the course includes some computing labs. I am not very good with computers and I know absolutely nothing about programming beyond the fact that programming languages are what people use to tell computers to do certain things, so I would appreciate any advice that might help make things a little easier when I have to do these labs. \n\nIn addition, I would like to ask whether it is worth learning some computing knowledge and/or programming skills before starting my course? I was planning to take an online course in computing as well as learn how to code with Python. \n\nThanks a lot!",

They teach programming from the very basics but some of my classmates found it very fast paced. I\u2019d recommend doing a free python course (codecademy is really good) before u get here. Good luck!",

So I wouldn't say you need prior knowledge at all (I didn't).",

    "postText": "I got a conditional offer from Imperial for MSc in Computing (AI and ML). The condition is a final overall GPA of 3.8/4.0. I had 3.82 when I applied but right now it is 3.79. It is my last semester and as a Bachelor's student, I'm taking some Master's courses at my uni so my GPA might end up in between 3.75-3.82. Do you guys think they would tolerate sth in between 3.75-3.80??",

I applied to Autumn 2023-2024 - Advanced Computing (MSc 1YFT) on January 25 and still no response. Conditional for 3.8 seems intimidating btw. But I'd say they would tolerate 3.75-3.80 if it's from a quality university.",

For reference, I am from India and we are graded on a 10 point GPA scale. 3 students from college got into Imperial with the exact same conditional offer stating 7.5 GPA. I currently have a GPA of 9.7 while the other two candidates have theirs around 8. Also, I put my expectated GPA as 9.5, so No, that doesn\u2019t matter. All three of us got into different courses as well. Hope this helps!",

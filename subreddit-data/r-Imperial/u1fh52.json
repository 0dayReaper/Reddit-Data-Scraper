A masters will be considered more prestigious, as it is a higher tier of qualification.\n\nBut also, since you mention the length of the course, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re international - and it\u2019s probably worth mentioning that a masters is one year long as standard throughout the UK.",

Your undergrad will probably still be important, yeah, but that would be true of any masters done anywhere. If you pass the masters, you clearly have enough knowledge of the course to have that qualification.",

A degree at imperial WILL get u through many doors in life. Ivies are also - obviously - incredibly prestigious, especially in the US. \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately all about where you want to live during and after your masters. UK (Imperial) or US (Ivies)? What type of student life do u want to have? Which course do you actually prefer.\n\nAll in all, Imperial and Ivies are both incredibly renowned by their own rights, in their respective regions. It\u2019s ultimately how the context of the degree suits YOU.",

Still, since it's a one-year degree, the academic pressure to perform would be intense, leaving no time for exploring British life, creating essential industry connections and growing as a person.\n\nWhile at Penn, The research in the control of robots is top class; it has the tag of an Ivy League. It's a 2-year program giving ample time to explore subdomains within Control systems and connect with other people working in the same field. \nThe courses for MS though, are not as good and specific as Imperial\n\nIt's a lose-lose situation; what should I do???",

I was wondering if anyone here took the program or could simply provide more info about it? What\u2019s the timetable like? What are the courses like? Anything related to the program really. Online it provides the name and vague description of each module so more info would be appreciated :)",

I applied to two London schools but am from the US. I was trying too understand the website and I feel like UK english is so different from American English language conventions; it sounded like a completely different language\u2026.. Would love to keep in touch if you do plan on attending because I am guessing we\u2019d be in many classes together!",

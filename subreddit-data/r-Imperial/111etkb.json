Aside from the standard \u201cwhy why why\u201d it is typically a bunch of general physics and math questions which compared to a school exam question would be lengthier or more obscure to solve so you will expected to talk through and slowly piece together a solution with the interviewer. The best way to prepare is try to not make a big deal out of it, the interviewer just wants to see that you have a logical approach to solving various problems. That said I probably lucked out with getting one of the nicer interviewers. Good luck",

            "comment": "Prepare by doing a bunch of old ENGAA questions from the Cambridge engineering admissions - these are a good idea of using A-Level concepts in an obscure way compared to what your exams might prepare you for. But be prepared to answer questions which seem broad, like how does a plane fly and these kinds of sweeping conceptual statements. They don\u2019t care if you\u2019re right or not - they usually just want to hear you try and argue an answer and then they\u2019ll probe you on whether the physics of it make sense or not. It depends a lot on your interviewer. Mine gave me \u2018how many tennis balls fit into a passenger jet\u2019 (a fair few years ago now) so I needed to know roughly the size of a passenger aircraft to begin answering. They didn\u2019t care about the actual answer, just whether I had retained how big an aircraft was and whether I was comfortable estimating. When you\u2019ve got an idea of the numbers you\u2019re playing with (their way of testing interest in aeronautics) the maths is very simple usually. It\u2019s hard to demonstrate interest in aeronautics from school, so all they can really test you on is math ability and whether you\u2019ve got at least an idea of what a plane is lol. My second interview a different year was even more chill - they just wanted to know what I did on an industrial placement that was in my personal statement. It varies wildly.",

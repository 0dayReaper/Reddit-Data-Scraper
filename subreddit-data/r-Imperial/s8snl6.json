    "postText": "Hey everyone, I was wondering what the difference is between these two programs? They offer an almost identical set of modules.\n\nI'm considering applying to Imperial after 4 years in industry as a software engineer, as I'd potentially like to steer my career towards industry research. My degree was in computer engineering. Has anyone here completed either one of these courses?",

            "comment": "They are broadly similar. The key differences are:\n\n* you have reduced choice with the specialism - about 2/3 needs to be SE-based in general (defined as the *selectives*), while every fourth-year module is a selective in Advanced Computing. And with the specialism for SE, you need to complete an additional group project.\n* You have more access to 3rd year modules in that you don't have the restriction that you can only take two of them that Advanced Computing has.\n\nI'm currently in Advanced Computing if that helps.",

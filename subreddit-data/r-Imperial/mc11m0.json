    "postText": "Hey guys! I am an international non-EU applicant. Have been offered admission to the Master's programs in Computing (AI+ML) at Imperial and Computer Science at ETH Zurich. Having a hard time deciding which one to choose.  \n\n\nHere are some of the pros and cons according to me-  \n\n\nImperial-  \n\\+ Shorter program (1 yr)  \n\\+ One of the best CS departments in the UK  \n\\+ Plenty of job opportunities (It's London after all)  \n\\+ Good location  \n\\+ More selective program  \n\\- Very expensive (would need a solid loan)  \n\n\nETH-  \n\\+ Cheap (will save nearly half the money compared to Imperial)  \n\\+ Best CS department in continental Europe  \n\\+ High quality of life and quite scenic tbh  \n\\+ Will get time to do research (leaving options for a PhD)  \n\\- Unsure of job opportunities later  \n\\- Not very selective (lots of students)  \n\n\nWhat are some of your thoughts? Is Imperial worth the money?",

Switzerland is a small country so ETH might be risky for jobs in case you want to come back to your home country for a job and your country values a foreign degree then I guess ETH would also be fine for you. Hope I helped you with your decision :)",

            "comment": "You always have to consider your career options after graduation and how to **maximize** such options (both in industry and academia).\n\nAssuming you mean the *undergraduate* Master programme (MEng): \n\nIf you're not a German speaker, then I believe your career options after an undergraduate degree at ETHZ (without a postgraduate degree in another country) are very slim to almost zero. However, if you are a Swiss national, then ETHZ is the ideal option for undergraduate studies. So it depends on specific circumstances.\n\nPostgraduate degrees are a totally different story. Read my other Reddit answer here on ROI of postgraduate degrees: https://www.reddit.com/r/Imperial/comments/mj0pzv/it_is_worth_it_to_do_a_msc_now/gtg3z6n/\n\nFYI: After graduating from Department of Computing (DoC) at Imperial, you will be essentially ***mathematically illiterate***, unless you already had a very strong background in Maths (e.g. most Romanian students in DoC have already attended STEM high schools). So, a career which requires solid Engineering Mathematics skills (e.g. ML, DS, Algorithms) is almost out of reach for DoC graduates. Most DoC graduates and alumni admit this themselves. This advice comes from a Hiring Manager in these fields, with lots of friends who are also Hiring Managers in these fields. Of course, you always have the chance for online courses to complement your traditional higher education. The title of a degree is **rarely relevant** for employers. It's the content and skills that count the most. Just something to have in mind.",

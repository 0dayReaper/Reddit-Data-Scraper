    "postText": "Within 10 September I have to pay the tuition fee, but I can't afford it as an overseas student. I wanted to ask if there's a way to obtain a reduction of the tuition fee. I looked for scholarships in the past months using the Scholarship Search Tool, but I've never been eligible for any of them. I'm a new student. Getting a loan wouldn't be very different, as I have to pay it back then. I don't want to give up Imperial just because I don't have enough money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI contacted [student.funding@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:student.funding@imperial.ac.uk), but they haven't answered me yet.",

If you come from a country that's listed here ([https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/money)), you don't need to. Either way, imperial does NOT require you to show them the funds.\n\nEdit: I didn't fully understand your comment at first, so my reply might be a bit confusing. Imperial does not require you to show them the funds. It is only UKVI who requires you to show them depending on where you come from. Don't worry if you've already shown UKVI your proof of funds. Also, I've heard that imperial is not going to impose any fee for late payment as long as the fees are paid before the course starts, so you still have some time to arrange the installment.",

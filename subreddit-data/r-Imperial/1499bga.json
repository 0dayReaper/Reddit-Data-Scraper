            "comment": "When I did EEE a couple years ago, all I needed was a laptop to do basic office tasks (emails, report writing etc). For any actual engineering work like running PSPICE or Cadence we would just use the lab computers. During the COVID shutdown, when we couldn't go into college they setup the lab computers to be remotely accessed so what laptop we used was inconsequential.\n\nI would say get something easily portable, good battery life, decent storage (500gb+ would be ideal). Any modern quad-core laptop would do, and to be honest a dual core would be fine. I still use my ThinkPad T430 for far more demanding tasks than what I used that laptop for while in Uni (3D CAD and Octave simulations) and it just chugs by. A decent laptop from the last 3-4 years will be fine.\n\nIf you want ultimate bang-for-buck I've been eyeing up either a ThinkPad X390 and X395 on eBay. Can get them from a refurbisher for &lt;\u00a3200 and for anything not graphically intensive (i.e. AAA gaming or 3D CAD) they'll do the job perfectly fine.\n\nEdit: Curious who is downvoting me? I'm just giving my actual experience of doing EEE at Imperial.",

Unless you're going into the more software developer side of things, most engineering software runs best or only on Windows, and even if you are going into a more software direction I've always found Linux to be more usable than Mac OS",

The reason I got a 2 in 1 was because I didn\u2019t have a tablet, and wanted something that was flexible as both when I was watching online, or when we returned back in the spring term. I still use it to this day, the only gripe I have is not getting something with more storage/more RAM, because the EIE software I have installed has taken a lot of memory. Any brand will do, just go for something with a large battery life, lots of storage and preferably 16GB of RAM.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much the EEE course has changed, but what I had to install was VScode, Issie, LTSpice, MatLab, Arduino, Quartus, Eclipse and some others too.",

Furthermore, unless you\u2019re a U.S. citizen, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to get sponsored. \n\nSo if your ultimate goal is to work in the US, you are far better of going to a US uni.",

Standards are both high, but you\u2019ll leave your 4 years at Imperial with significantly more domain knowledge ( as you\u2019ve been specialising from the age of 16 to 22 ). American / IVYs /Liberal Arts education is valued for being broader. IVY Graduates work bloody hard but they often have to top up their UG with a masters if they want to specialise in a technical field.\n\nTo quote a friend who did a year at MIT:\n\n\u201cI had to solve harder problems on my UK curriculum, but I had a much higher workload, and had to work harder for longer ( just on less complex material ) on the US curriculum\u201d.",

            "comment": "I studied mechanical engineering at Imperial and I think in terms of prestige for Mech Eng it\u2019s second to none and brand recognition amongst companies and HR should not be a problem given how much university ranking popularity has increased in recent years. In US News it\u2019s ranked highest amongst US and European unis for mechanical engineering. I think the major obstacle when applying to work in the US won\u2019t be the prestige of the university but rather access to its job market because most jobs require US citizenship or a visa permit. So with that being said I think if your ultimate goal is to work in the US then I would try to study out there and try to get on an internship and then go from there.",

I\u2019m currently moving to the UK from a foreign country so I am only able to bring my iPad with me. \n\nI have a gaming pc right now so I wanted to know if maybe the computer science department had some old desktops to sell? It would be much cheaper than trying to build a whole new rig.",

You don't have to move out over Christmas or at Easter -- just in summer. A lot of people are in the same boat as you though and they get a house sorted to start before they have to move out of halls so they move their stuff straight from halls into a house!",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\nI am a final year mechanical engineering student from India. I'm gonna apply to the Msc Sustainable Energy Futures program at Imperial College this week. I would really appreciate it if anyone could tell me a few things. First, how long does the university take to respond to applications and second, how hard is it to get a scholarship at Imperial being an international student. I saw that the Energy Futures Lab has an international scholarship program. Does anyone know how many awards they provide?",

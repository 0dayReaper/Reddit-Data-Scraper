    "postText": "Hi all-- I applied to the Bioengineering department and was wondering whether anyone has received an interview? The website says you MAY be invited for an interview and has a lot less detail regarding their selection process compared to other departments. I received an email at the end of October saying they were currently processing my application, but haven't heard since. Am just becoming worried because a couple of my friends had interviews ages ago (other departments) and offers soon after. Thank you! :)",

Some of my friends who also applied to Imperial (Chemical Engineering) were invited for an online interview and they did theirs this week. However, I got an email from Imperial, saying I have to do an Online video Submission, instead of an interview. So I guess you should probably wait for Imperial to  respond back, thery might have something planned for you, dw :)",

I applied to molecular bioengineering because it doesn't require physics - I have only studied physics when I was literally a child! I will just wish that they don't ask me any of the physics questions :(",

For mine, my interviewer asked me questions straight out of my personal statement and it was mainly centred around biology, so do make sure you know your PS well, as well as \"Why Imperial?\" and your motivation towards the subject. I know they also asked some others brainteasers (not really on science content) and some maths functions, but there shouldn't be as many (or any) Physics related questions for Mol Bioengineering as there is for Biomedical Engineering, unless your PS is full of Physics. They tell you this during the introductory session as well (BME is more Physics and Math, Mol Bioengineering is more Biology and Chemistry). So don't worry, just brush up on what you know already and you'll be fine! Best of luck!",

The interview task was pretty easy, not really hard or unseen science content either\u2014 just collaborate with your team and make sure you put yourself out there and speak up. Same advice: as long as you know your high school science knowledge and PS well, you should be fine.",

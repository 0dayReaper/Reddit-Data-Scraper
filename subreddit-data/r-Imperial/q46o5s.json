Sign up for societies and trust me it will make you feel a lot happier.",

Try to make the most of your group projects, gel in, settle as much as you can and if you have good work flow with some people, try to contact them again and do some more projects with them. Form a work network, it will benefit you greatly when it comes to sharing solutions together or working on problem sheets. You're on campus this time (at least partially) this year, so try to make use of the facilities and form some meet-ups if possible.\n\n2) Join societies, any society.\n\nI joined some societies in my 3rd year, so it is never too late. But, societies are good to keep you from going insane, you can meet people with similar interests, which is most important of all in such a cold uni, similar interests + similar degree = very good times.\n\n3) Don't destroy yourself.\n\nPlease prioritise getting enough sleep over shegging yourself over a first year C++ problem exercise, when you put it into perspective, health is wealth - and Imperial can render you a very poor man if you neglect yourself. When you look into some of the better students, they are not really putting in all nighters (at least not every night lmao), I'd say just get at least 6-7 hours of sleep no matter what.",

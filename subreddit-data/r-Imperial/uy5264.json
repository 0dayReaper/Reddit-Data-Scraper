In my group in mechanical engineering, broadly speaking, you have a dedicated desk with monitors, personalisation etc, in am office, in the same room as your research group. Some groups are fancier, with their desks in the upper floor of their lab, some do hot desking, some (DTPs) are in a gigantic office with about 100 Seats. I think in chemical engineering it's smaller offices with maybe 5 to 7 desks, so just you and part of your research group. Bonus, you might get an office with a view to the royal Albert hall, so you have among the best BAFTA views.",

Probably sharing the office with 100 other guys if seats can be interpreted like that may be unusual, otherwise everything sounds just how I hoped for \ud83d\ude0a. I've seen part of the recent Graduation, streamed from the Royal Albert hall and the interior spaces looked stunning.",

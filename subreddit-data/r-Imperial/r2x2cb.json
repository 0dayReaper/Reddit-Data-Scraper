    "postText": "Hi, I received an email this week stating that I should be taking a maths exam of 45 minutes and upload video in the next two weeks. I was wondering if anybody knew what kind of questions they ask and if I should revise anything. I\u2019m applying for civil engineering and am an international student from Belgium. Any help would be appreciated! :))",

The math test had very easy topics in it, you don\u2019t need to revise for it if you are doing good in maths. In the video submission they asked me questions that weren\u2019t very technical e.g what\u2019s a hard experience and how did you overcome it? But the last question was a bit longer and I struggled on it abit.\nHope that helps.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone!\nI\u2019m going to graduate with a bachelors in business Administration from an affiliate centre of Royal Holloway (which is located in Mumbai, India). I got a 69% in my second year and am aiming for a first class honours if not an upper 2:1 grade in my final year as well.\nMy question to you all is that is it necessary for me to give a GMAT when applying for a Masters in Strategic Management? I\u2019ve gone through the website and even though they highly recommend it, they\u2019ve not mentioned that it\u2019s mandatory. \nI have some work experience (3 internships) and volunteering certificates from 2 NGOs.\nAm I being too ambitious thinking I\u2019ll score a place in Imperial without submitting my GMAT score? (Asking because a senior was rejected for the same course; she says it happened due to the lack of GMAT scores. She also had very good grades and work experience.\nThanks!",

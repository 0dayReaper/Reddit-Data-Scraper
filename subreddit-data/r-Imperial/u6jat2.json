    "postText": "Hi, whilst A levels in the UK are now completely linear, students doing international A levels still give AS exams separately and the score is combined with A2 exams to determine the grade. Typically, Imperial doesn't consider UMS in the decision making process. However, I've seen many cases in which the department of physics, in particular, asks for UMS from it's international applicants. So, what would a good UMS be for theoretical physics at Imperial? I'm doing CIE Maths, FM, Physics and Chemistry. Since I do CIE, we receive a PUM (which is essentially the same as UMS, just named differently). However, PUM is calculated differently from UMS, and the way it's done makes it harder to get a higher PUM. For example, a PUM of 90 would generally translate to a UMS of 93. Would 90 PUM + in Physics and Maths and 80+ in Chemistry be enough? (FM exams are all in Y13). Any international students doing physics here care to weigh in? Thank you.",

If you have a 90+ PUM it should be enough, but they do look at your personal statement and the admissions test.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're concerned, it might be worth sending an email to the admissions department who might be able to give you a better answer. The students don't generally know why they got admitted!",

Is this good enough or am I going to be at a disadvantage?",

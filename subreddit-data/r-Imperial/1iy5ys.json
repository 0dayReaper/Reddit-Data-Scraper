    "postText": "Hi there!\nI'm a student who just finished Y12 and I hope to study Electronic and Information engineering (AKA Information Systems Engineering).\n\nI recently attended an open day and I have to say I was rather disappointed. This is for a few reasons:\n-The students I spoke to seemed 'drained'. They seemed to have lost their passion for their subject and  the uni just had a pretty 'depressed' vibe on the open day\n\n-At the EEE talk, they guy who gave it was extremely boring, monotonous and liked to ramble on about random unrelated nonsense. What really didn't sell it was when he said 'I teach most of the units in year 1 and 2'\n\n- I've heard from a previous Imperial graduate that since it is a postgraduate orientated University, undergraduates tend to be treated like second class citizens\n\n- The horrible M:F ratio which I experienced at the open day\n\n- The coursework showed off in the computer labs was AMAZING (particularly from one of the moderators of this page, jamt9000). I don't feel that I have the academic potential for Imperial\n\n- It seems that most people come to Imperial for a job in finance (this comes from reading previous posts on here)\n\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm not here to slag off Imperial. I'm just sorta upset since I had my heart set on here and it wasn't what I expected. I feel that if I apply, I'm applying purely for the course and prestige, not for the whole aspect of the university.\n\nIf anyone does have the time, convince me why Imperial is the right choice and why I should apply here. At the moment it looks like I might go to Manchester to study EE, is Imperial better? Why?\n\nThanks for reading, I appreciate that this post is too long, also I don't mean to insult you or your institution\n\n\nEDIT: Congratulations r/Imperial, I will be applying next year (if I get the grades)",

            "comment": "Hey,\nI just finished 1st year of EIE (using gf's account), and am really happy with my choice. Would definitely recommend it. You sound in a similar situation to me - my second choice of uni was EEE at Manchester. Glad I chose Imperial though.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't be swayed by an open day, they aren't very representative of much. If it was at the end of term (you said recent) then most students will be very tired and drained, due to exams and being end of the year, so that likely explains the lack of enthusiasm. \n\nNot sure why the 'guy' said that. In first year, did around 12 modules, each one with a different lecturer. So whilst yes, some aren't brilliant at teaching, they only affect a small amount of the year. \nIn lectures, they won't ramble on unrelated stuff, so shouldn't be too bad. Lectures are only an hour long, so the end of a dull one is always in site!\n\nPost grad university? Whilst it does have many post grads, not sure that it's 'orientated' that way. I've never heard that comment, and certainly not experienced it. They definitely pay attention to students comments, and don't treat undergrads poorly. \n\nM/F isn't that bad. Consider that a large proportion of the M are reclusives that never poke their head out of the door. In clubs and societies, I've found the ratio to be much better. (Knew a guy who did pole dancing club, if you're really in need). It sounds a poor ratio, but in reality I haven't found it that bad. \n\nCoursework does look amazing - you will get that good. You'll never know if you're up to scratch if you don't try. I haven't found 1st year that difficult, but it will definitely get harder. If it all goes tits up, can then relocate to a uni with a less demanding workload. \n\nJobs in finance are common, but that's mostly because they pay well. No obligation or pressure to do so. EIE has a very good employment rate, and lots of people go straight into engineering jobs (as I intend to do), so wouldn't worry about that point. \n\nIt is definitely easy to have a good time here, and work. Maybe less so in later years, but people in their final years still come on club trips I go on, so I wouldn't think you will have a dismal work-filled time if you come here :) The experience you have will depend on what you do. Work less, get a 2.1, but have a fun filled time, or work hard and get a 1st? Up to you.\n\nGeneral reasons for Imperial as a uni:\n- Has the largest selection of clubs and societies, there are loads to choose from, and they're awesome.\n- London. Expensive, yes, but well worth it. Is an experience that you cannot get anywhere else, and is so vibrant and interesting. Think the city was the main reason I chose to go for Imperial. \n- Prestige and better degree do come into it ;)\n- Location. Nice museums, posh nice area.\n- Halls are very nice, definitely in Eastside/Southside. Share if you want to cut costs, I did and it was fine (though ofc go single if you can afford)\n\n\nFeel free to ask more questions :)\nLove the uni and the course, want to promote it!\n\n\n\n",

So far apart from Imp and Manc, I visited Southampton which, although an excellent campus and course, had a horrible city. Booked into Newcastle, York and Bristol as well.\n\nEDIT: Also, if you don't mind me asking, what did you do for the FPGA game project? I was pretty amazed you do that in 1st year as most unis do it in 2nd or 3rd",

Workload this year was no more than EEE, and almost all of our modules were EEE - it's just that they might do them in 2/3rd year, whilst we do them in first, but miss out some of their other modules. \n\nThis year they changed the FPGA project to do video processing, dealing with input as well as output. Lots of us thought the changeover wasn't the best - we were given new cameras and not much information on how to use them/the data input (dodgy lecturer). But it worked ok. My friend and I created a game of pong, where the paddles followed the movement of your finger, which was viewed by the camera. Game worked (pretty much. Obviously not as smooth as you would like, but it functioned). That was the only time in the whole year I really felt any pressure, but it really is good fun and a good learning experience. ",

I wouldn't worry about the department itself, both are top notch and are at Imperial, so will be fine.\n\nIf you like knowing how things work, do EIE. That is why I chose it. I like knowing how computers work from the ground up, from logic gates to pure software/cloud computing. If the low level stuff doesn't interest you, I'd recommend computing - although I don't know too much about the course. I would say EIE also allows you more flexibility in areas of work; you can work with any form of electrical system, rather than just with ones that require higher levels of coding. (This is my opinion, not 100% sure)\n\nTo try and help you decide, I'd look at the modules contained in the 2nd/3rd year of the courses, and see what is appealing. I did this, and saw some in computing I wouldn't be too keen on, and some in EIE I would miss not doing. Also talk to the departments as well as students. Just send them an email, sure they'll be happy to help. \n\nGood luck deciding!",

In first year, there are courses on both hardware and architecture. Hardware covers stuff on logic gates (although admittedly nowhere near the level of complexity that I'd expect from EEE) and eventually builds up to making a 16-bit CPU from scratch. Architecture builds upon this, as well as teaching IA-32 assembly. If you enjoy architecture, you can also choose it as an option in second year, and if you enjoy that too, there's always advanced computer architecture in third year :)\n\nI agree that EEE will probably cover lower level stuff in more detail (although I must confess I've never actually looked at a list of modules), but thought it was worth mentioning that you can choose Computing and  still cover a fair number of lower level aspects.",

The workload is heavy (compared to other universities, that is), and the end of term can be very stressful depending on what is going on; usually projects, assignments from 3 weeks before, potentially exams. And the exams are hard; unless you are particularly gifted, prepare not to get straight A's for your exams.\n\nYes, Imperial has a terrible M/F ratio. It's become a running joke here, and you need to go to Life Sciences/Medicine or other unis to find significant numbers of girls.\n\nYes, postgrads are given a special status (they have their own, better lunch room), but undergrads are not treated like shit, far from it. There are plenty of us here!\n\nBut: \n\nImperial has a prestige Manchester probably does not, particulary internationally. That is enough for some people to come here, and 10 years down the line I can see it being a definite plus.\n\nThere are lots of clever people here, and I found it great to be surrounded by people on this level; it really pushes you to achieve better.\n\nImperial has great links with business. This can be finance/banks like you said, which attracts plenty, but also a variety of other big companies (Google, Facebook, ARM, BP, etc.) all come and recruit at the uni. This results in lots of people having a job offer before they have graduated. *Imperial students have a better reputation with employers* than most other universities, partly because of how hard it is (which is manageable, by the way, as long as you study!). This is critical for first jobs.\n\nSo, ultimately, it boils down to what you want to get from university: a good time and a good degree, or a world-class degree with the hard work and experience to match (and the London experience with it)?

You will be more geared to working with hardware systems than complex software systems.\n\nOf course, if you take the right modules in Computing, you can also specialise towards those areas; I secured places at ARM and Imagination Technologies for my industrial placement, in compiler development (both of which I ultimately declined...). EEE people would typically go lower than that though, all the way to the silicon if that's what you want.\n\nSo basically, do you want to be a software engineer or a hardware engineer?

Programming and OS are included in EIE, so you won't miss out on most of computing, and it also gives you an insight into how a systems/computers actually work, which I find  really interesting. If you like how stuff works, do EIE. EEE department is fine, nothing lacking at all :) Can't comment too much on computing. \n\nIf you're unsure and want advice from Imperial, I would email someone from each department.

For example, there were first year students who had created an operating system on a Rasberry Pi, and as explained it I had no clue what they were on about. Also there were a lot of bright people in my group that could answer the questions the first year students were asking and were also asking questions myself.\n\nTo put it simply, I felt out of place. Even though I do enjoy computers/ electronics, I know I am nowhere near as talented as those students. ",

I was a bit in awe of what the first years are doing nowadays, like that [Raspberry PI assembly language chess](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/4300), in my day the closest we got was matrix multiplication in x86 assembly.\n\nBut I wouldn't feel intimidated by that, firstly because the projects they show at the open day are obviously of a high standard, and some people put a ridiculous amount of time and effort into them, so it's not necessarily representative of the work you'd be expected to do, and secondly because they'll teach you all the stuff you need to know. I know people who had no experience with programming before coming here, and managed to ace all the labwork and projects.",

            "comment": "I'm having to use a throwaway for this sorry because my main account would be far too easily-identifiable after a comment like this in /r/Imperial.\n\nI'm going into 3rd year in Computing after the summer. I have to admit that my initial reaction after reading the first few paragraphs of your post was that you've already managed to sum the place up, despite having only spent a day here. There have been many moments where I've felt completely drained - well and truly wiped out. That isn't characteristic of me at all, and definitely isn't something I ever experienced before university. It's definitely not easy. I'm aware that my coursemates have had similar experiences this year, although I feel the need to point out that 2nd year is famously difficult in our department. I was definitely much happier in 1st year.\n\nI wouldn't say I've lost the passion for my subject, but what I have lost is the will to tinker with anything subject-related whilst I'm not doing university work. Before I came here, I'd spend a lot of time reading tech. news and playing with new technologies. Hobby projects, just messing about, sometimes even freelance work, you get the idea. Nowadays I spend my days working so hard on university stuff, that the last thing I want to do in the evening is something along the same lines. Although in reality, by the time I stop working for the day, I'm too exhausted to do anything meaningful anyway. Even if I *did* want to tinker with an open source project or whatever, I'd feel too tired to do so.\n\nI'm not sure that Imperial is PG-orientated, but I do agree that students aren't as valued here as they are elsewhere. I think that this [Felix article](http://felixonline.co.uk/comment/3540/an-uncaring-university/) (our student paper) summed it up pretty well.\n\nHaving said that, would I make a difference choice if I could go back to being in your position? Absolutely not, because I know it'll be worth it. I can't speak for EEE, but I feel as though my course is excellent. I really have learned a lot, and look forward to building upon that next year. Generally speaking, the teaching is excellent, and I know that the degree will be worth it. Imperial has such good prestige internationally, and great industry links as mentioned by others in this thread. When I compare myself to people I know on similar courses at other universities, the difference in academic standards is very apparent. I'm the kind of person who always makes decisions based on the future (playing the long game in life, if you like), hence I know Imperial was the right choice. That said, if you're the kind of person who likes to play the short game, and would rather university was as amazing an experience as you'll have heard about, then Imperial might not be the best decision for you. If you're going to come here, you need to accept that you're sacrificing the typical student life. Your friends at most other universities will likely go on nights out 3+ times a week, and won't spend anywhere near as much time working. I was always one of the most sociable and outgoing people in my friendship groups through secondary school and sixth form, and it's felt kinda hard watching friends 'overtake' me socially over the last couple of years, if that makes sense. But as I said, I'm all about the long game, and I'll have my fun once I've (hopefully!) graduated and got an awesome job :)\n\nOne final thing - if you do come here, join a society. There really is an awesome selection and they offer the perfect opportunity to switch off from everything and just enjoy yourself.\n\nI hope this has helped. It's something I've thought a lot about, so I couldn't let this post go by without commenting. I really hope I haven't been too harsh on Imperial. As I said, I'd still choose to come here if I had the choice again! There are also other positive points that I've not mentioned because other people have mentioned them already, and I wanted to touch on the points you'd made yourself instead.",

            "comment": "I'm a EEE who just finished his first year and my roommate used to study Mech Eng at Manchester before coming to Imperial to study Maths. Throwaway so I won't be recognized.\n\n* Imperial does have a lot of postgraduates but we have separate separate facilities (computing labs, electronics labs, common room) and the only postgrads we come in contact with are teaching assistants. I have never felt as a second class citizen at Imperial.\n\n* M/F ratio at Imperial does suck but it's London, you will probably have a social life outside of university.\n\n* They teach you amazing stuff here. You will never know if you have what it takes if you don't apply. When I came here I was overwhelmed by how smart people were. It also worried me that almost everyone had done further maths and I hadn't, I knew there was no way I would get a first here. But I worked hard and put in the time got a first and I'm ranked in the top 5% of my class, the result surprised me. My roommate who studied at Manchester told me it wasn't challenging at all. In one of the courses the lecturer had told him that no one gets &gt;70%, once in a few years we get someone who scores 80%. My roommate looked at the past papers and they were all the same, he scored 95%+. Though he scored a first by a large margin, he quit the course because he found it boring and reapplied to Imperial. Of course this is anecdotal and YMMV, but I do believe Imperial is more challenging and also more interesting.\n\n* I feel the most people get lured away because it pays more, but there really is no pressure to go into finance. It is completely up to you where you want to go and engineering firms do like Imperial a lot.",

    "postText": "I'm a coming postgraduate student. Been looking for flats on spareroom. At first my priority was location. I preferred as near campus as possible bc I'd like to prioritize my study. I realized now it's expensive to get a decent room near campus (&lt;15min walking). Can y'all give me any insight on the housing situation? \n\nAnd is there any idea when is the earliest time during the morning a class may start? This may make a huge impact in my willingness to settle somewhere farther \n\nThanks!",

I ended up spending pretty much all day on campus from about 10am to 6pm-10pm depending on deadlines, and just got used to it. I think its perfectly easy to manage living further out so long as the commute is reliable. Most students live in Fulham and travel in by bus although I dont know how this will change with covid now. Personally found the most important factor in choosing where to live was being near to a tube station and good supermarkets",

You can cycle in from Fulham or West Kensington (both full of Imperial students) mostly on quiet back streets (a 'Quietway'). As others have said, anywhere along the north edge of Hyde Park is also a good shout and is of course a nice walk (and an easy cycle) in.",

I was living 35-45 mins away from the college I transferred to and I\u2019m glad to have moved closer. Now I\u2019m in the same city, about 10-15 mins away. But I got very lucky with finding comparable rent. Otherwise I would\u2019ve been paying at least an extra hundred or two in gas driving back and forth so much. (Or taking an hour+ bus ride, many of which are down in my area due to Covid). \n\nAnyway I\u2019m much happier to be near campus. I realize I\u2019m lucky though.",

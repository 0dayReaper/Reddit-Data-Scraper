    "postText": "I'm an international student, applied for civil engineering and I met my conditional offer on Aug 10. Now that i confirmed my place at Imperial and registed my Imperial email account, all I have left to do is wait for my Accomodation allocation and the CAS so i can apply for the  student VISA to the UK. A friend who currently studies at Imperial said he recieved his CAS like 3 days after he got his offer. Its been 4 days and i still haven't recieved it. Do i email them? How many international offer holders have accepted to study at Imperial and recieved their CAS already? If you have recieved ur CAS, could you please say how long it took to recieve it?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/p42e4u)",

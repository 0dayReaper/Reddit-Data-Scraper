    "postText": "Hey everyone, I just got accepted to the MRes Medical Robotics and Image-Guided Intervention Programme. I\u2019m curious about any graduates who completed the course and what their experiences were? I\u2019d like to get a detailed outlook especially from any computer science background students, and if there were any challenges in tackling the medical portions of the course. If there\u2019s anything I can do to prepare beforehand I\u2019d greatly appreciate your guidance! Thank you",

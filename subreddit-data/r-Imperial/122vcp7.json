    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI've been accepted into the MSc Computing AI ML course and wanted to know if anyone has any official employment data for the same. If anyone here has graduated from the course, it would also be helpful if you could share your job hunt experience. \n\nIn specific I'm looking to get answers to a couple of questions: \n\n1. Was the job search made easier due to having done this course from Imperial / Did Imperial help you land the job in any way?\n2. What is the average salary one can expect post graduation (to pay off student loans)?\n\nAny other info you can provide would also be greatly appreciated!",

It\u2019s up to you to pass those interviews though, which often require preparation outside of the degree (review math and algorithms, grind leetcode). I\u2019ve interviewed people from all the top 10 CS unis in the world and everyone is different, some didn\u2019t pass the first round. For the salary you can check levels.fyi, theoretically you could get an offer by any of the firms in London.",

I saw quite a few salaries in the range of 110k but other people I spoke to said that such salaries are rare in the UK. What is your take on this? \n\nI want this information as I'd like to know how I could repay my student loans. \n\nThanks for your help!",

Those salaries are rare, yes, but I know plenty of Imperial graduates at that level or even (much) more. But I graduated from a PhD so we may have different experiences. Apart from that I can\u2019t really say much more. \n\nThe university can help you up to certain point, but  at the end of the day the person interviewed is you. And that applies to Imperial, Oxbridge, Stanford and MIT, just to mention some.",

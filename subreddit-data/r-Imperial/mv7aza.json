    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI studied a Bachelor in Economics, with several courses in Math. I took Linear Algebra, Calculus I, II, III, Differential Equations, Probability and Numerical Analysis, while taking Statistics I, II, Econometrics I, II and Mathematics for Economists I and II. I think that I have a sound background however, most universities do not list Economics in the pre requisites tab. I wonder if anyone has a similar background and have been accepted to top Universities mainly in UK (Imperial, Oxford, LSE, etc)",

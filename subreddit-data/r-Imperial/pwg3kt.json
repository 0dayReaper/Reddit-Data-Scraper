For me, I have 4 of these modules running in autumn and like 3 in Spring.",

            "comment": "Unless it has changed substantially in the last few years (it in fact may have, I was on the old EIE course so this might be different as I think EIE3 is now on the new syllabus) then yeah, you can take more than 2 doc modules.\n\nWhen I did it, you were required to do 7 or 8 total modules (BEng and MEng respectively) of which one must be from EE, one from DoC, and one from the Business School. The remaining ones could be freely picked from EE/DoC in the ratio you wanted.\n\nI would assume that its still similar based on what you've said, if for no other reason than the reason the EE department changed the EEE/EIE syllabus was to add more computing content to all courses",

But the EE modules can be AI, ML, deep learning and another computing oriented module so in essence you can just take 7 computing-oriented module.

    "postText": "Hello everyone i just got admitted to some grad schools and i can't  decide which one to go... I have UCB Meng in ME(aerospace  concentration), Cornell MS ME, Imperial College MS aerospace engr, UMich  MS aerospace engr, and Columbia MS ME... These 5 are my final round  choices.\n\nSince i study aerospace engr in my undergrad at Purdue, i don't want  to switch to ME if possible. So speaking of aerospace engineering first,  it looks like UCB is a better choice comparing to Umich and Imperial.  However, UCB only offers a Meng program and no MS this year(sad). I  wonder if it is still obviously better than the other MS programs. And  Imperial's MS is also 1 year. I heard people saying something bad about  it.. But i have many very smart and hardworking friends at IC and it is a world top10.\n\nAlso, Cornell and Columbia are Ivy schools and are strong at ME(which  i don't know much at least for now...i just talked to some students in  these two). But they don't offer aerospace stuff and i find that a lot  of people get admitted which makes it looks a little...\n\nThank you for reading this i really appreciate any kind of help/advice!! Thanks.",

    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI'm planning to apply for civil engineering this year. My video submission/interview will probably be next year 2023. I'm here to see if anyone same major can help me preparing for this interview. It will be so helpful if anyone can share your advices and experiences, such as what specific type of questions to expect from the interview (I know it will be 4 general questions plus one logic or technical question) and advices on answering them.\n\nReally appreciate your time for replying. Have a nice day.",

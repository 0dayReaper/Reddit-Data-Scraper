            "comment": "Honestly, learning is always going to be valuable and university learning is the easiest to validate. You can definitely learn on the job to the same level but validation of your skill will require circumstances to be on your side if you learn on the job. Your time in academia is the easiest time (in practical terms) to learn and demonstrate knowledge - you'll always be able to come back later and learn, but it might require more effort.\n\nUltimately the value boils down to you personally, will it make you better at the job? Will this knowledge allow you to proactively engage with a business at a higher level? Or will it just be a certificate? \n\nIf it will give you confidence and develop skills you want then you probably have your answer. It's value is on you though, and being honest with yourself.",

You can also change course as you go if needed!\n\nEdit: this comment is in relation to an undergrad + post-grad combined degree. If you're choosing an MSc after finishing your undergrad, it doesn't apply in quite the same way!",

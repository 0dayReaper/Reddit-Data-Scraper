    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI received an offer from Imperial recently and am considering doing my Master's in biomedical engineering there. I'm an American and have a bachelor's degree from an American university.\n\nI'm wondering if any Americans (or anyone in general) living/studying at Imperial in London could share their experience. I like big cities and liked London a lot when I visited. How's the academics, career prospects post-grad, social life, etc.? Any advice and experiences are welcome; good or bad.\n\nThanks!",

There are many options) and departments usually try to organise social activities throughout the year (Idk for sure about your department because I study Computing). Imperial has a couple of bars inside/near uni and students go there sometimes after the classes are over. Also you might hear about parties being organised (by students) at the bigger halls (Woodward) (no you don't need to be a resident there to join, you just need someone to sign for you at the entrance). Overall, I would say you'll socialize a lot and have lots of fun.",

            "comment": "FYI, unless you're a naturally a stellar student, the academic life is MUCH different than what you're used to. Trust me. They are more theoretical in their academics than schools you may have attended (i am sure MIT and the like rival tho). Get ready to grind. There's no time to have a life at this school. One thing is certain - you'll learn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: american who attended imperial for an Msc as well.",

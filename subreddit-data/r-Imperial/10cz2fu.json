    "postText": "I\u2019m currently considering doing my masters at imperial which would have me in London for the year. \n\nIn this situation, where is recommended to live? Is there suitable student accommodation available? Or do I go private housing? If so, how would I go about finding housemates before I\u2019m even in London? \n\nI\u2019m really just rather unsure of how loving arrangements would work! I would prefer somewhere quieter if possible. I would situated at the South Kensington campus so I\u2019d need somewhere near there or with good public transport links to it.",

            "comment": "I'd say it's entirely up to your budget. London is massive with all sorts of ranges of prices and distances. There isn't really much of student accommodation for masters students, there is only guaranteed first year students hall for first year undergrads but after that you're on your own.\n\nTransport is generally pretty decent wherever you end up living. I used to cycle everyday, about half an hour from South Kensington campus, as it was cheaper and even faster than public transport. \n\nEither look up private accommodation via something like spareroom, or hit up some groups on social media for Imperial students or even London students in general looking to find a place for a year. I think Imperial has some sorts of official system for private accommodations but if I remember correctly they were pretty pricey, but again that's entirely up to what you can afford, and London can be quite expensive.",

            "comment": "Current undergrad at SK campus: many students live in the Fulham/West Kensington/Hammersmith area. Depends on your budget. You may want to join some group chats / fb groups as they usually have students looking for roommates &amp; (legal) subletters. Most tenancy Agreements are a year, so you\u2019re sorted in that respect. The other option is Evelyn Gardens - this is an accommodation run by imperial that is exclusively for non-first years. I\u2019m unsure as to whether PG students are allowed to stay there but I\u2019m pretty sure integrated masters students stay there so I don\u2019t see why stand-alone masters students wouldn\u2019t be allowed.\n\nPrivate renting at the moment, you\u2019re looking at roughly \u00a3220 per week per person. I\u2019m paying \u00a3200 rn, but that\u2019s because I renewed my agreement from last year. The housing market sucks at the moment, I know friends who were asked for double to stay in the same place they did last year. Crazy stuff.",

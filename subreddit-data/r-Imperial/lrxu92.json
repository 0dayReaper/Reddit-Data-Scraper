    "postText": "I am a student from UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz) and I am going to enroll in a professor's class. His name is [**Tyler Sorensen**](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~tsorensen/)**.** He has done his Ph.D. from ICL, and I am assuming he also taught a few courses at ICL. Can anyone tell me what kind of professor he is? He will be teaching me CSE 113: concurrent and parallel programming.\n\nI also do not see anything about him on Rate my professor, I do not know if ICl uses that sight",

            "comment": "In his website he says that he has worked in the Multicore Programming Group at Imperial which I can tell you is very good. Alastair Donaldson who was also his supervisor briefly taught us Imperative Programming in Java and the guy was a very good teacher - communicating the information into very interesting and digestable chunks. He also worked at Google simultaneously (Alastair), so he is a very talented guy.\n\nIf Tyler was even a bit influenced by Alastair, I think he will be a good lecture and his understanding of concurrent programming should be high. Good luck!",

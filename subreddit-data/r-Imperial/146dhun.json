    "postText": "Hi, I recently got rejected to study MSc Artificial Intelligence and got an offer for my second choice - MSc Applied Computational Science and Engineering.\n\nI accepted the offer and messaged the faculty of Engineering asking if it is possible to switch this to MSc Advanced Computing before starting this year.\n\nThey told me I would have to withdraw my offer, email them a new personal statement and they'd consider me for the new course with the chance of being rejected, which would mean I have no option to study an MSc this year.\n\nMy motivation for this is due to the difference in AI content and rigour/prestige of the new course. Can anyone who've studied either course please give any advice on whether it is worth to risk it? Would employers care about the difference?",

            "comment": "The two courses are pretty different. Whilst the Adv Computing course has a lot of ML options, the ACSE course is entirely focussed on it. They're run by different departments, Computing, and Earth Science and Engineering. If you were rejected for Adv Computing once, what has changed on your application for them to reconsider you?",

I got my second choice which was MSc ACSE\n\nI basically emailed the department and they said they'll consider me for Advanced Computing if I reject ACSE. It'll be done internally, I won't have to submit a new application or anything.\n\nI wasn't aware ACSE was entirely focused on ML/AI! I thought it was more about practical implementations of computing. Do you do ACSE, and if so how much of the course is ML/AI focused?",

It would be risky. \n\nACSE is probably 80% ML, with some numerical methods and data assimilation. It's mostly practical applications of those, rather than theory-heavy courses.",

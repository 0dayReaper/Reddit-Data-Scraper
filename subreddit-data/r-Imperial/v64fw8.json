    "postText": "I have 2 days to choose maths at either imperial or Durham to study in September - which should I choose?\n\nI do not particularly like maths. I chose the subject as I am relatively capable at it and can work decent hours at it (at A Level maths and further maths standards). Both offers are unconditional so there is no difference there. I\u2019m not sure if I can hack the Imperial workload - maybe I can, but maybe I\u2019ll get burned out and feel shitty.",

Many of my friends would watch loads of videos on maths and read plenty of books on all sorts of maths, I never felt any interest whatsoever in doing that (except for some maths and philosophy type books like GEB).\nIn short, I like working on maths problems but that\u2019s where my interest ends.",

I can't say I relate to that (I'm definitely more like your friends), but if that's what you want to do then I suppose it's reasonable.\n\nAs for differences between Imperial and Durham? The differences in the course won't be too meaningful. Imperial has a relatively heavy workload, but if you're a conscienscious student, you'll be fine. Clearly enough people are able to cope with it to graduate after all! \n\nDurham probably has quite a heavy workload too though, really. And the course will probably be about as difficult too, though the difficulties may be placed in different aspects of the course.\n\nReally it's a matter of where you want to live. Durham and London couldn't really be more different as cities.",

The situation you\u2019re talking about where you have a question and simply have to solve it is very far from what math at university is. Maths is nothing like how it is in school, you aren\u2019t given an equation you have to apply etc. instead you\u2019re given a statement and have to spend multiple pages proving it in the analysis module. Likewise for the other modules. You need to seriously understand the difference between maths at uni and at school\u2026 it is very common to spend 2-3 hours + and barely make progress on 1 question especially at imperial which has pretty difficult problem sets and harder exams.",

I think you should really consider how you want your life to look for the next 3 years. Imperial is a very modern/modernised university in Central London, full of international students and staff and great connections to both research and industry. Durham (from what I've heard) has a very oxbridge vibe to it, college system, tradition, beautiful campus in a small town environment. If the price is important, I'd expect Durham to have significantly more affordable cost of living as well. Maybe check out the student union as well, Imperial has the biggest society and club selection, but something might catch your eye in either of them.\n\nBear in mind what everyone is saying here, Maths at Imperial (probably everywhere but especially at Imperial) is really hard, but if you're set on doing it, it gives you a lot of career opportunities and I hope it all works out well for you!",

Its an extremely demanding degree right after oxbridge maths(especially cambridge) so its highly likely way harder than durham. Imperial is objectively more prestigious for maths, but whats more important is whether you would be happy for the next 3-4 years. So pls make a wise choice so that you wont regret your choice.",

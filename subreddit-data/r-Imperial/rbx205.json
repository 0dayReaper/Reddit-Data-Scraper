    "postText": "Hi everyone! For the past few years I have been wanting to study Translational Neuroscience at Imperial, but I am afraid I left the application too late. I believe the applications opened in November, but it doesn't say anywhere online when exactly they open and close. Perhaps someone from previous years knows? \n\nI've also been reading posts on the student room and it appears that people have been placed on the waitlist 4 weeks ago. Which was the second week of November... \n\nDoes that mean that the course is already full? If that was the case, would they not close the applications? \n\nDo you think it's still worth applying?\n\nThanks in advance!!",

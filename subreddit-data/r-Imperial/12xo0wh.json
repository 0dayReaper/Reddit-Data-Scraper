I applied in Mid-March and havent received a reply uptil now, there are no staged admissions like other programs, so when should I expect their reply ?\n\n2.) How good is this program? I have seen many posts about MSc business analytics which kinda tells me its a well known program. (Havent seen much of AME, maybe it being a ok course at imperial)\n\nthank you for your time.",

Some AMEs that did some time in industry or attended universities that operated similarly to imperial had a smooth time. Students who came from universities with different curriculums or priorities would struggle a bit (well let\u2019s be honest, everyone struggles anyway). \n\nAlso don\u2019t read any reviews for any other programs other than the one you are planning on attending. Switching departments is equal to switching universities in terms of the individual student experience, especially between business and engineering (and medicine, and science).",

If you had to fill out a quantitative statement in your application you\u2019ll probably get 1-2 technical math questions but it\u2019s mostly behavioural. Kira interviews only test your ability to think on feet and composure under stress. Just be confident and don\u2019t sweat it, you\u2019ll be fine.",

    "postText": "I will be starting BSc Biochemistry and I would like to look through some of the course material before the classes actually start. If anyone who does biochem would like to share some info regarding this (textbooks, lectures etc), I would be very grateful. Moreover, how are exam timetables structured? For instance, do we take semester exams before or after the Christmas break? Thanks in advance.",

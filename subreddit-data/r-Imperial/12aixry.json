    "postText": "I have admits from Imperial College London and NUS for MSc Business Analytics. I have been getting mixed responses in terms of the employment prospects in both countries. Here\u2019s a summary of what I have been told till now-\n\n1) It is extremely difficult for foreigners to get an Employment Pass in SG (EVEN AFTER GRADUATING FROM NUS)\n\n2) UK firms will require you to undertake an internship if you have no prior work ex before they offer you a job. This is usually difficult to manage along with your coursework at Imperial. Which means I will have to work another 6 months after graduating at minimum wage which probably won\u2019t be enough for me to sustain. This isn\u2019t a concern in SG since the course at NUS includes a 6 month paid internship already.\n\n3) It is also pretty hard to get work visas in Uk but easier than Singapore.\n\nThis is all I know as of now, please correct me if I am wrong about any of the points above. I thought Businesses Analytics was a highly demanded degree in the job market when I was applying but the reality seems far from this. I am just so confused about where to go now \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. Please help me decide!\n\n(Note - I have a partial scholarship at NUS so the financial burden is a little less in Singapore)",

An internship (paid too) could be a pathway to employment if you do okay. Cost of living there is generally lower than in London, though I've read that rents have skyrocketed. They're very multiracial too, btw. \n\nPrestige-wise, I doubt NUS can match Imperial though. Can't comment on course quality as what I studied was vastly different. Also doubt you'll have time to intern mid-course.",

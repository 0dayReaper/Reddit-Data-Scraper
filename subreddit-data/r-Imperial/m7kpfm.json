And if so, should this be something that influences my decision?\n\nThanks",

            "comment": "I did the MSci instead of BSc. In my view, the course is much less rushed than the BSc. Your final year project is one-year long (compared to half-year), so you get much more from your project.\n\nYear 4 electives are also one of the best courses I have attended, so I do recommend the MSci. \n\nThe downside is that, you must attain a certain grade at year 2 (55 I think) to continue. But I think it's worth it.\n\nEdit: you can PM me if you have any more questions.",

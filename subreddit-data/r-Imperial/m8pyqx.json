I'm MechEng and personally can't imagine having every weekend \"off\" to relax with the family especially if it's a multi-hour trip one way.\n\nThe course is pretty pressured so at least 1 day on the weekend is spent during tutorial sheets, lab reports, coursework and going down the Wikipedia/YouTube rabbit hole to procrastinate doing said tutorial sheets, lab reports and coursework.\n\nWhen my siblings went to Uni they came home every 3-6 weeks mainly to eat something other than tuna pasta bake for the 21st time in a row.",

Had a great group of folk to hang out with and spent most of the evenings at 568 (one of the union run pubs). You obviously have to be wary of catching the last train home but if you're happy to call it quits at 23:30 to start heading home you'll be okay.\n\nIf your social life involves pre-ing in halls then clubbing till 04:00 then yh... life at home is a disadvantage. \n\nSociety trips/meetings usually are at/near the college so joining societies may be a bit of a struggle if you constantly are at home on the weekends. I didn't take societies very seriously since I fell behind due to some health stuff in Autumn term and COVID shielding from March onwards but I would recommend them if you can. I'm probably gonna try to take it more seriously in third year.",

    "postText": "Hi all! \nI recently got accepted to study my masters in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation at Silwood and just wondering if anyone has advice regarding accommodation? Am stuck between living on campus in a dorm or living off campus either in the area or in Central London with my partner. \nI guess all depends on the atmosphere on campus, so if anyone could advise me on what it's like I'd really appreciate it!\nThanks a mill",

The campus is beautiful, and it's nice being just steps from great nature trails, as well as the campus facilities. In my year everyone on campus knew each other and became good friends, and there were lots of parties and activities and just impromptu hangouts that the off-campus people really missed out on. I would strongly encourage anyone to live on campus!",

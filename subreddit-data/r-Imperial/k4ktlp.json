    "postText": "So I applied to Imperial for Civil Engineering, and I was asked to do a Online Maths test and a Video Submission - I completed both sometime in mid-November. I am yet to hear back from Imperial. Btw, my predicted grades are 4 A\\* and I wrote a pretty good Personal statement. Initially, I thought that this was an alternative method to Online interviews, as interviews online might be quite hectic with thousands of applicants. However, a few of my friends, who also applied to Imperial, have been invited to an online interview. I also see many people on the subreddit who have received offers from Imperial for their courses - almost all of them did an interview for Imperial. I haven't seen many people who did video submissions getting offers from Imperial on Reddit. Therefore, I'm quite worried whether this means - Imperial ONLY interviews the applicants which they will most likely to select and are less focused on the applicants who were asked to do the video submissions. Does getting interviewed mean having higher chances of being selected than people who were asked to do a Video submission? If not, Why are some applicants asked to do a video submission, if we can all just be interviewed the same old-fashioned way?",

My friend applied for Aerospace and had to do an online test which was non-calc, only Maths, and had an invigilator.\nThe test was only 8 questions, but it took like 6 mins each for me. All of them were maths questions, but were based on real-life problems (since i applied for civil, the questions were stuff to do with bridges, volume and stuff). There was a timer when you start the test and each page is one question. So like you cant go back to the previous question once youve clicked next. It wasnt that bad tbh, i know you ll do great. Idk qhat course you do, but im guessing the questions you will get are also all maths and related to your course.",

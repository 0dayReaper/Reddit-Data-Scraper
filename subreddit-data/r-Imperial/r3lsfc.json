            "comment": "A few technical questions I've seen for EEE (same for EIE probably): Graph sinx/x (+ prove all the properties at 0 and inf), graph sin(e^x ), some basic calculus stuff (derivative, integral), area vs volume of sphere.\n\nGenerally speaking, make sure you have read the course specification and know in advance what kind of modules you'd like to pick (esp. those offered in 3d/4th year). The professors like it when you show them you know what you've studied the course structure, so even if they don't specifically ask you, I'd mention a module I'd be enthusiastic to take.\n\n Based on your post history, I see you're interested in RTL (and so am I). EIE is perfect for RTL (you can do it from EEE too), and there are a lot of very engaging RTL projects for the first 2 years, like in [this module](http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC40003&amp;s=E1) where you design a fully functional CPU from scratch in your second term!\n\nAlso, from a comment I made 2 years ago (things may have changed a bit):\n&gt; As a current 1st year international electrical and electronic engineering student at imperial, you should really not be scared about the interview. I\u2019ve spoken to many people about it, and unless something drastic has happened since last year, the interview for EEE is really easy. In my case, it was a simple maths question (graph of sinx/x), plus a few questions about my personal statement and why I wanted to join imperial (should you get invited for an interview, make sure you ready on the course syllabus first and mention a few modules you are really excited about doing). Feel free to PM me should you need any pointers, as I am happy to help.",

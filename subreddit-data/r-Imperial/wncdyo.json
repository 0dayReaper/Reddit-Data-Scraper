I will have the funds to pay for Imperial but that money would not have been in my Parent\u2019s bank account for 28 days prior to the day we submit our Visa application.\n\nApparently to get a UK student Visa you have to show that you have the funds to pay for your course for 28 days before the day you submit your visa application.\n\nIs there a solution to this?",

Not actually paying for you but who had the needed money on the account and who relates to you so it won\u2019t raise questions? \n\nAlternatively, you can pay the full tuition fees now, get a new cas (takes like a day after you email them) with the \u201cfull amount paid\u201d and then you only need to prove you had the living expenses in your bank account for the last 28 days (if that is the case of course)",

I just need to show evidence that the fees were paid. And can someone who is not my parent pay the fees in full?",

You\u2019ll probably need some funds for living expenses (very little, just for grocery shopping etc) but if you submit a CAS with tuition fees paid and also full accommodation, I literally see no reason why they would refuse you. Also, if you\u2019re going to have an interview in the visa application centre you can mention it maybe or explain but I would not worry about it. \nAs to who pays it. Nah, can literally be anyone. Just have them write your name and application CID if you\u2019re doing a bank transfer so imperial knows its for your fees",

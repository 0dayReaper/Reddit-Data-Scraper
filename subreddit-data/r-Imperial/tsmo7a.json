    "postText": "I'm a student at the University of Bath studying undergraduate CS. I'm averaging around 80 - 85% so I guess a decent enough 1st. I've been working part-time as a SWE at a YC startup during my studies and I've managed to land an internship at Google this Summer also. My A Levels were A*AA (CS, maths, psychology - weird choice at the end there, I know) if that's still relevant. I imagine the quality of references + other factors are likely to pay a big role, but am I likely to be offered a place on Imperial's advanced computing course with this background? I'd be interested to hear the backgrounds of anyone already on this course if they'd be willing to share.\n\nSecond question is regarding whether a masters would actually be worth it in the first place (especially given the price tag and potential opportunity cost). My reasons/thoughts are as follows:\n\n* I love CS and wish to expand my knowledge of the subject, and perhaps specialise in a particular area (not entirely sure what yet - I quite enjoy programming language/compiler theory).\n\n* I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the CS department at Bath (not that it was terrible, it was just pretty clear that they didn't have access to the money/resources they wanted/needed) - would love to experience what I understand to be arguably one of the best such departments in the world (general opinions on the quality of the department and academic staff would be appreciated).\n\n* Career benefits (I hear very conflicting reports on how useful a MSc is in this regard - given that I potentially have an entry into big tech already assuming my internship goes well, could Imperial give me the knowledge, connections, etc. to climb even higher?)\n\n* Opportunity to meet talented people (sounds very corny but I think there's definite value in surrounding myself in people far more capable than I am lol).\n\nApogies if this is a bit rambly - it's late and I'm very tired. Any suggestions, pointers, recounts of personal experience, etc. would be much appreciated, thank you!",

There are definitely very good connections you can make at Imperial.\n\nIt's also one more year of student life for better or worse before you start working full time.",

                    "comment": "Yeah I think specialisation is the key benefit here. Assuming things go how I hope they will and I get a Google return offer then I don't think an MSc would be worth it from a purely financial perspective (\u00a320k + living costs + a year not earning Google salary is going to be hard to recoup), unless I decided to specialise in something like AI, quant, etc. perhaps. I guess it could still be worth it from a 'I enjoy learning' prespective but that's something I'm going to have to think about further. Thank you :)",

Compared to most universities, their program (depending on the modules you choose) can be more mathematically demanding. The relatively shorter teaching terms (\\~9 weeks) can be annoying though.\n* Undergraduate background: CS and Maths from St Andrews (pretty low first though)\n* I'm not sure what you're looking for from the personal statement part - one thing I did mention was to explain *why* Imperial.",

Was wondering on what you decided and why you chose that route? Any luck getting an offer from Google after the summer?\n\nI am also currently trying to figure out whether doing a masters would be worth it especially seeing how crazy high the cost of the masters at Imperial is, and the time it would be taking out of my career. Would be great to hear your thoughts.",

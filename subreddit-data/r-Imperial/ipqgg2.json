    "postText": "I, as well as many others, applied to the Evelyn Gardens returning undergraduate accommodation option for this year. The rooms themselves were offered in a first-come, first-serve basis, and the application opened on the 6th of July. I completed the application approx. 2 mins after it had opened. \n\nNow, you would imagine, that since the ~250 rooms available would be offered on a first-come,first-serve basis, we learn the outcome of our application almost instantly, right? There is no need for a manual process- the first ~250 applications get the rooms, and everybody else gets rejected/waitlisted. I could probably write a quick python script to automate this process in an hour or so.\n\nThat is precisely why I was dumbfounded when September came and I had yet to receive ANY word about my application. After contacting the accommodation office, all they had to tell me is that \"the application process has started, but it takes a while to send out all the offers\", a ridiculously stupid excuse for their total silence for 2 months! \n\nNow, I had originally planned to secure my accommodation by late July at the latest. So what was I supposed to do when the first week of September came and I had yet to receive an offer/rejection? I could simply not risk waiting, just to receive a rejection letter at the last moment and being left without accommodation on the 10th of September!\n\nI immediately sought accommodation, and found a room that suited me (which was, of course, more expensive, and further away than evelyn gardens) last Friday. Now what do I get? An accommodation offer letter for Evelyn Gardens on the 8th of fucking September. I could not believe it that they were still sending out these things THIS late.\n\nI had already paid my deposit, so I had to decline the Evelyn Gardens offer. Nevertheless, I am not here to complain, just to warn all other prospective Evelyn Gardens undergraduates to NOT wait for imperial and their ridiculously slow process next year. Please secure your own accommodation and don't wait for the dumbasses at Imperial to delay your accommodation by 60 days because they can't be bothered to send a simple email saying that you were accepted earlier than the start of fucking September.\n\nIt is truly inexcusable for a world-class university to be unable to handle this extremely simple process in a timely fashion.",

This includes when we can move in, when we need to pay the rent or Evelyn Gardens quarantine policies. \n\nIt\u2019s very frustrating the radio silence that they have given us but it is a college wide problem as apparently first year students haven\u2019t even been told which accommodation they have got. What a terrible mess!",

I was leaving my first year accomodation at Wilson in March and not only did they manage to lose/give away/throw away all of my belongings (clothes, all uni work, kitchen supplies, and anything else from my room). But they acted like they had all my stuff untill I turned up at the door to collect it and then refused to let me in to try and locate my boxes.",

At no point did they tell you that they would be unable to provide a room, or that you should make your own arrangements.\n\nIt's possible that the process wasn't as straightforward as you think, and Imperial might have had other factors to consider (eg. COVID-19 decimating student numbers, reducing number the students in each accommodation to allow distancing, adapting spaces to be safer).",

Every person I know who applied received their offers 3 weeks before I did, and they purported to have also applied immediately after the process had started, like I had.\n\nImagine you were in my shoes, and you knew 5 weeks of offers had passed, with you not receiving anything. I was basically convinced that they hadn\u2019t even received my application at that point. Even if they had, it is statistically improbable I would get a positive response, and waiting for a rejection is untenable - I needed to book accommodation, NOW, before every single affordable room near imperial is gone. I had no choice but to seek private accommodation, and to be honest, I was LATE in doing so.",

    "postText": "Meeting Imperial Conditions\n\nHi everyone, I had been admitted into Imperial for Aero. I had a conditional of getting a certain score in my board examinations which I did, submitting ATAS which I also did; however, I submitted my English test three days past the deadline. \nAs a result of this, I have been put into reconsideration till August 18th.\nOn contacting the university on three separate occasions, they said my prospects look great, it is very highly likely my place will be confirmed and it looks really promising but they can\u2019t guarantee anything.\nWhat do you think will happen?",

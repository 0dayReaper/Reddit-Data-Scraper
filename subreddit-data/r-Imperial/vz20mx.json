    "postText": "I have been accepted into both of these institutions and I am struggling to decide between the two. Could anyone share your thoughts? I would be very thankful!\n\nFirst of all, I am an international student who is looking into getting into R&amp;D in the field of electrical/computer engineering or in finance/investment banking.\n\nIMO both unis have fantastic programs for engineering but I know that Imperial's Electrical Engineering program is more rigorous and complex than UBC's engineering program. I also read somewhere that Imperial graduates that do well are sought after by investment banks (which means greater employment opportunities). However, I think that the process of getting permanent residence in Canada is easier than that in the United Kingdom (ILR).\n\nThe reason that I am conflicted is that I know that it's easier to get a job after graduating from UBC if I get into their coop program and get admitted to the engineering path of my choice (preferably electrical engineering or computer engineering). However, I'd have to apply for the coop program and for my engineering path after my 1st year so I'm a little worried if I'd get the pathway of my choice. However, I know that it is relatively easy to switch majors from electrical and electronic engineering to electronic and information engineering at Imperial as they are under the same department. In addition, I can change from a 3 year bachelor's course to a 4-year bachelor's and masters course relatively easily at Imperial (which can hopefully help me pursue my dreams of working in R&amp;D).\n\nIf I end up at UBC, I will be working in Canada. If I end up at Imperial, I will be working in London. Both London and Vancouver seem like nice cities. The difference in price between these two institutions won't differ by much (if I take Imperial's 3-year bachelor's program/UBC's scholarship). I also might have to go for my mandatory military training (as I'm Korean) after my first year so please keep that in mind.\n\nWhat are yall\u2019s thoughts? Perhaps any insights or opinions? I would be very grateful!",

            "comment": "I would take imperial any day. I\u2019m an EIE student and our course has by far the most flexibility out of any degree at imperial. You can take EE modules and computing modules, and some of these modules are very finance related i.e machine learning and signal processing for finance, stochastic processes, advanced optimization etc. \nFull module list here: http://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/crslistug.asp?c=J3\n\nAlso EIE really allows you to tailor the course whether you want to do more EE or CS, whatever. In terms of location, London is a financial capital of the world alongside NYC, the opportunities in fintech is incomparable to any Canadian city. Imperial also have a placement program where you can do a long 6 month placement for a company, not the same as a full year co-op but still decent. Imo I would choose imperial, it\u2019s much harder than UBC but it\u2019ll be worth it. Also Imperial has far more name value. I was also offered a 60k CAD scholarship from McGill, Georgia tech and UCLA and chose imperial. The demand for tech workers in London is also massive and with imperial being the main tech uni, we get a lot of recruiters.",

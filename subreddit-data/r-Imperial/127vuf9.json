            "comment": "I'm a first year (international) bioengineering student at Imperial, and I'd suggest you talk about this issue with your parents, since they're probably the ones that will be paying for your education.  Unfortunately, the costs are ridiculous: think not only about the cost of your course, but also housing (that's at least a third of your tuition fees), transport (London's underground is literally the most expensive in the world), cost of living etc. I think most of the students here are so well-off that they don't care about expenses, since they can afford them. On the other hand, a good degree will drastically increase your chances to get a great job, which will make it possible to earn this money back somehow, hopefully",

Depending on which one you'll be offered (during application you pick 5, you usually get offered one of those 5) you're going to pay 170-250\u00a3 weekly. For the rest of your course, you'll probably rent a flat with someone, the cost will be dependent on the location and number of flatmates. You can get something decent for about 250\u00a3 weekly + bills. \nHow much you're going to pay for the tube depends on where you'll live. One trip there and back from zone 2 to zone 1 (for example to the campus and back) costs below 4\u00a3, though if it's not during peak time you can go lower using a Railcard (highly recommend getting one if you're going to use the tube quite often). You can also try to buy a student travelcard, for which you pay biweekly/monthly/quarterly/ yearly and which allows you to travel without limits. May be a good option depending on where you live, you can check the prices on the internet. \nIn terms of food, I cook for myself and the cost is usually around 200\u00a3 monthly. Not counting the alcohol and occasional eating out.\nIf you're going to order food (as many students do, surprisingly, considering the cost) it's going to be way more. \nI hope this is helpful :)",

The one small thing I\u2019ll add is: to simplify things, I\u2019d suggest assuming about a \u00a3500 per month budget, excluding rent and bills (I used to include bills the past couple years but thats not really sustainable anymore in the energy crisis.) From what I\u2019ve seen in me and my friends, this is a pretty average monthly spending. \n\nYou certainly can live by using much less, there were months during lockdown when I spent less than \u00a3200 a month. But I was literally only spending money on groceries and always cooking at home. Eating out, having lunch at uni, travel, commute, hobbies, going out etc will all add up to this and I found \u00a3500 to be a good middle ground. \n\nUsing this, me and my parents budgeted for about \u00a34500 per year (3 months per term, 3 terms) as spending money assuming I don\u2019t stay in london over the breaks.",

    "postText": "Hey, I'll be joining Imperial in septembre 2023 in the MSc Climate Change, Finance, Management program. I'm wondering how hard it is for master's students to participate to the uni student life (i.e. societies, or students bars like the Union bar of fivesixeight). I'm an international student and in my country masters student rarely engage with the undergrad student life. However I wish to make friends haha\n\nThank you !",

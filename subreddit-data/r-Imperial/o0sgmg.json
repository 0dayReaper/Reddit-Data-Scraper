I\u2019m not sure if I can meet the grade 2 for the offer requirement even though I would really love to go imperial :(\n\nHas anyone gotten below a grade 2 yet imperial still gave you a place or do you know anyone else who that had happened to? Any reassurance would help thanks guys :)",

The department is not obliged to take you and it really depends on your year, but don\u2019t just lose hope yet!\n\nThey would update UCAS and took them a bit over a day to send out the acceptance, was actually freaked out coz I thought I ain\u2019t gonna make it.\n\nAlso worth noting is STEP papers are marked on a curve so you might not have done bad at all",

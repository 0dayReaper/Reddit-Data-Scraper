    "postText": "Alright so, I've applied to Imperial for Civil engineering. Last Tuesday, I got an email for them with a link and instructions for an \"online video submission\" which is due on the 24th. The email says the link will direct me to a page where i will have to record my answers to questions which will begin once I click the link from the email and must be done all in one go, approx. 20 minutes. My only concern right now is the type of quetions I will be asked, because they will most likely be questions which are quite broad and generic, unlike interviews which are more personal and specific to you, which i think really sucks. Hence, if there are any applicants who had to do the same or if there are any civil engineering students with tips/advice to share for answering interview questions, please do so in the comments.",

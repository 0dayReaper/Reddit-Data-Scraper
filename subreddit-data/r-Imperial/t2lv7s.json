Got a perfect score on the IB and am looking for universities to enrol in for computer science but am worried about lack of a social life hahaha. Sorry if my english is not good",

It depends on how you manage the workload and how you value a social life. You can certainly enjoy your social life... at least for the first year.",

            "comment": "I'm replying to this a little late, but I would definitely say that you can find the time for a vibrant social life, societies etc. if that's what you want from your time at uni. It's just a matter of setting realistic expectations for your academic performance. I'm in my 4th year now (EEE), and on track for a decent First (\\~75%). I definitely sacrificed a fair amount of time to ensure that I got those grades, but in hindsight I would have had a lot more free time if I had just set myself a lower target. Even then, I'm fairly happy with the social life I've been able to have while here. \n\nI think the toughest part is letting go of the innate drive that I think of lot Imperial students have to always do your best on every piece of work / exam etc. It's an important enough point that at the start of first year my head of undergraduate studies said that she'd prefer us to get a 2:1 and have plenty of fun, than to agonise over getting a First.\n\nOf course this all goes out the window if you're another one of the wizards who somehow spends all their time in hackathons, societies and bar nights and then still makes it onto the Dean's List.",

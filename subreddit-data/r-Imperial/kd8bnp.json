    "postText": "I have an offer for physics at Imperial, but I\u2019ve recently realised that it\u2019s probably not the best course for me. I foolishly listed books on my personal statement that I hadn\u2019t yet read, and after reading them, doing some research, and talking to my teachers, I\u2019ve realised that physics is going to be too theoretical for me, and I would be better suited to something like engineering.\n\nMy physics teacher advised me to contact admissions ASAP, so I\u2019m now in the process of looking at different courses to request to switch to. For a while now, I\u2019ve been stuck between EIE and Computing. My main interest is in programming, which makes me lean towards computing, but some of the physics and hardware stuff in EIE looks pretty interesting as well. Not to mention that computing is ridiculously competitive, has STEP (which I haven\u2019t done), and I haven\u2019t done A level computer science either. I\u2019m just somewhat concerned that if I go into EIE and turn out to find the computing topics more interesting (which is a distinct possibility), then I\u2019ll end up wishing I had just applied for computing instead to get the full breadth and depth of computing topics that it offers, as well as making it easier to go into further research or a career in computer science.\n\nWith that said, EIE and computing students, what has been your experience, and what would you advise? In particular, how heavily does the EIE course focus on computing-related topics?",

            "comment": "Throwing my two pence in as a former EIE student (and fwiw they have reworked / are midway through reworking the syllabus), I wish I had done computing, but that's a me problem and EIE is still a good course.\n\nThe way it was structured is that the first two years of EIE are pretty much entirely taught by the EE department, and you have no choice in what you study (they might now give a limited choice in 2nd year?). EIE is pretty much half of two courses, and if you discover that you really prefer one course over the other it can be tough.\n\nIn my year of EIE I'm pretty certain we all agreed by the end of our second year that we wish we did computing. I think there was maybe one person who wished he'd done EEE instead?\n\nYou're right that in 3rd and 4th years you can freely do modules from the department of computing (hence doc), which does make life a lot easier if you discover you hate control/digital/signal processing. Sometimes coming from EE to Doc works out well for you - there were a handful of 3rd year DoC modules that were basically 2nd year EIE modules with a bit extra content, and if you only cared for maximising your grade that is a pretty easy way to do so. On the other hand sometimes things go the other way. \n\nFrom an employability perspective, I don't think there is much of a gap from computing. Maybe some specific fields are easier having done a computing degree, maybe some specific companies will filter for a computer science degree over computer engineering (what I tend to list my degree as). On the other hand some companies do actually prefer that EIE tends to do lower level stuff - there are plenty of software jobs that still hang out very near to the hardware that like programmers who come knowing assembly / computer architecture / verilog and so on.\n\nAlso I mentioned the course syllabus has changed - I can't directly comment on it but it is meant to be focused a lot more coding. There's some stuff I'd consider pretty key to studying coding that in EIE used to get taught in 2nd year whereas in computing it tended to be a first year thing, that's now changed, which should hopefully further reduce issues doing doc modules in 3rd and 4th year.\n\nHope this helps you choose between them, and good luck with switching away from physics if that is what you choose to do!",

What happened to you is pretty much what I'm concerned about myself, thinking that I should've just done computing from the start. Hopefully the rework of the syllabus will lessen that. It's good to know at least that I wouldn't be disadvantaged in terms of job prospects if I choose EIE.",

It is utter bullshit that you should pursue the subject you are absolutely passionate about, since such thing does not exist for 99% of the population. Studying is a disciplinary thing, and it should be fine as long as you have enough interest in the topic to not drop out. Physics is about the best course you can join at Imperial for quantitative industry/swe position other than the EIE, computing you mentioned with its ridiculous competition. I study EIE, and I am fucking miserable doing circuits. But I got 90+% A+ on math and computing modules so I am going to be fine as long as I dont completely fail my circuitry. Yes, my life would be significantly better in a computing course, but only at Oxbridge+Imperial. I would never do computing at other lower tier institutions. Life cannot be perfect. Physics is beautiful, and I would kill to get your spot since I have read those texts you wouldve mentioned in your personal statement during highschool and loved it. Physics is still my hobby and how I spend my free time. Just go on and DO NOT listen to the hypocritical assholes suggesting you that you should rather take Computing at some no-name unemployable college because the reality is, uni name value sticks onto you and follows you around for the rest of your life unless you become a founder for some next level amazing startup like Elon Musk did.",

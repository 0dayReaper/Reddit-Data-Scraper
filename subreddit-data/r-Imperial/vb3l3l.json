    "postText": "Hello! Please pardon the long read, I'd really appriciate any and all help. Thank you.\n\nI'm a rising senior in America right now, entering my last year of high school, and it's about that time to start with college applications. I'm trying to leave this country and started dreaming about attending university in the UK. I'm going to apply for materials science and engineering and was wondering if I could get some guidence.\n\nI've scoured the internet and still some questions are left unanswered. \n\nAt my current school I am in a specialized engineering program that has provided me with many, hopefully, useful skills. By the time I graduate I will have completed an engineering related internship, invented two products, as well as completed several classes in various fields of engineering. I know that schools outside of America have far better education so I hope the engineering program will put me on par with some other students. \n\nI'm a very active student, varsity athelete, co-founder of a club, and an active member of many more, with fairly high grades. I have a 4.5 Cumulative GPA, scored a 34 on my ACT, and I'm expecting 4's and 5's on my AP tests that I will receive the results of in July. Once again, I'm sure this only places me on a level playing field with other international and domestic students. \n\nHowever, at most of the UK schools I'm looking to apply to, I seem to not even come close to the requirements. Some schools require the equivalent of five 5's on the AP tests which I certainly will not meet. \n\nSorry for the long winded post, but now the actual questions:\n\nShould I not even consider using up one of my five applications on schools with high requirements? For example should I replace something like Imperial College London with something like Queen's College in my applications? Will a top 1% ACT score help me at all? If applications are due by the 15th of October, what do I still have time to do to get me even better chances? \n\nI'm probablt forgetting to mention something really important but nonetheless, thank you for whatever help you can offer.",

Right now on the UCAS i have UCL, Imperial, and Cambridge, along with Manchester and Sheffield which i\u2019m hoping will be relatively easy to get into. I guess my question there is if they\u2019re so \u201ceasy\u201d to get into are they worth going to?",

But the benefit of the university name is that you're more likely to get interviews just cuz of the name on your CV. Other unis are also a lot cheaper to live in cuz London is expensive af. They're still worth going to but you'll be working amongst the best in the world at Imperial, UCL and Oxbridge.",

I would like to ask current/ex first -years how much time you had for extracurriculars and I guess social stuff\n\nI\u2019m keen on joining a couple of Imperial College Union\u2019s clubs, but now I am worried there is not enough time for me to handle them alongside the coursework",

I\u2019m just curious with regards to the general workload. I plan to join more project-oriented societies (e.g Engineering Change) so I definitely have to commit some time cuz it\u2019s a big asshole move to bail on my teammates. Thanks for your input",

If it is your first time living alone and coping with life I would be careful where I spend my time. If you have that figured out and you are a social person then ye you can join whatever you like (though I assure you, there will be no shortage of project work in the future)",

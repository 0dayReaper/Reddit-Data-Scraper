    "postText": "TLDR; I have a 2:1 in Mechanical Engineering from Greenwich (a rubbish uni, but an accredited degree) and want to study MSc Composites, do I have a chance?\n\nI\u2019ll spare you a life story, but I was never particularly academically successful at school, I hated it. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and I\u2019m finally realising my academic potential. Having just graduated from a low end university do I have a realistic chance of getting through the door at Imperial?\n\nPretty noddy question and I suspect no one will have a clue, but I thought I\u2019d ask. Would love to hear any success stories coming from similar backgrounds? Ta.",

I spent a few years building startups after I graduated though so I think that was what got me in. \n\nSo yeah it's possible, if you can prove that you can get shit done, are ambitious, and are willing to work hard for extended periods of time.\n\nP.S. I also (probably) have ADHD and was shite at exams. I just happened to find a few topics that I was genuinely interested in, so that the \"H\" in ADHD kicked in.",

My background was in a tangentially related field.\n\nMy experience of degrees is that Masters level is the least competitive (I've done 3). As long as you're proficient and paying, they almost always accept you, so I wouldn't fret too much about it. Unless you're coming in from a completely unrelated background or have some aspect that would make undertaking an MSc (unable to do English etc), then I think you have a good chance!",

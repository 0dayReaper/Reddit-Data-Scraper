    "postText": "I recently applied to MSc BA program and got an invite to give my interview. I kinda feel like I gave only a half baked answers to all the questions. Overall would rate my interview experience as below average. \n\nI wanted to understand from those who got admits, how did you feel about the selection process, do you guys think that the interview component is the deciding factor for getting an admit? I mean like, is it given the highest weightage? \n\nI am super stressed thinking about this, so I thought I would check with you guys in the subreddit. \n\nPlease feel free to drop your opinions. \n\nHave a great day!",

            "comment": "It's a hard question to answer considering nobody really knows what goes on behind the process but based on my research, 50% of the people who gave interviews get selected. It's actually a holistic process and imperial considers all aspects of your application before taking a decision.\nHope this helps",

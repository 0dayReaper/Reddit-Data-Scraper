    "postText": "Hellooo good people of Imperial!! I am looking on to start preparing my application for Fall 2024 for MSc Finance and Accounting. I mailed the admissions team for a pre-assessment since I will be paying \u00a3100 for the application fee and I do not want to pay until I'm really sure about my academic creds. The admissions team wouldn't help me on this, so here I am.\n\nIf y'all could please let me know what was your CGPA if you got selected at Imperial for this course and whether an additional professional degree and work experience helped you make your profile stronger? Also whether a GMAT is a deal breaker? Even tho they say they do not require a GMAT, will it really matter?\n\nHere's a lil bit about myself\nMy undergrad CGPA is 9.3 out of 10 in a finance and accounting bachelor's. I completed my ACCA. Have 3+ years of work ex. \n\nGetting into Imperial is a big decision for me to make as I do not have enough resources to take an uncalculated risk. :) Hope you could share 2 cents about it :)",

            "comment": "Your profile is good enough. I am an Imperial admit this year and there are plenty of people in my batch who have average profiles and still got in. For reference, people with no work ex, 8 gpa and 316 on the GRE are in. I even know people who have gotten in without GMAT. So you\u2019re on the upper side of the spectrum rn. It also depends where you did your UG from tho. The primary factor are your essays, you can have a below average profile but you have a good story to explain your passion then chances are pretty high. Getting into Imperial for Masters isn\u2019t as hard as people make it out to be. Dw. Best of luck!",

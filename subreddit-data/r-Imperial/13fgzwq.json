    "postText": "I\u2019m a medical student from Australia coming to do an elective at St Mary\u2019s Hospital through Imperial from 14/8 to 22/09. I was wondering what student facilities (at St Mary\u2019s or South Kensington) would be open to use such as libraries etc.?\n\nI\u2019d also be curious about whether there\u2019s any sort of social stuff that\u2019d be happening? Coming over summer break wasn\u2019t my first choice but it was the only time period my home university would approve.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am an international student. I saw the GradPad price and it seemed okay for what is offered. What do you think of the cheapest standard studios at Griffon? Are they as good as the numbers and photos say? How safe is the area? Are there any other cheaper student type accommodation you recommend me to have a look at? For me, the advantage of griffon is that it is very close to the south kensington campus. I'd love to hear about your thoughts!",

            "comment": "Hi, I have lived at white city gradpad and visited griffon quite a few times due to friends from course staying there.  \nThe internet is fast and you don't have to care about bills(electricity and water). I used to be in the common room all the time so have made a lot of good friends.  \nyou have parties and gatherings organised by resident assistants(students staying there can get a part time job with administration and assisting other students).  The gym is good enough for me but you can get a subscription from ethos imperial for cheap.  \nThe rooms are advertised according to my white city experience.\n\nThe only problem now is due to corona common places are on booking only/ completely closed. This takes away the meeting different people part away :(.  \nAlso, in white city, since a lot of people use the laundry machines I feel they're a bit dirty. But, it would be same any laundrymat I guess.  \n\n\nOverall, it's good place to live. but I would advice to look at 80 woodlane which is a newly constructed building in white city campus. Looks like a huge triangle. if you can find roommates. you can get a apartment there for the same/similar price as gradpad. It has great view across London and is overall an awesome building.   \n\n\nCongratulations, on your acceptance!! :)",

In reality, I'm most likely going to live in private housing (eg. in a landlord's home), but the Griffon studio got my attention as it has some nice features and I expected it to be way more expensive especially given its location. But it turns out that it costs the same as living in a studio in downtown where I live, which does not even come with the services and features that the Griffon studio comes with.\n\nBy the way, will living in the studio be exclusively for me? As in, will I be living with anyone, like how it is in halls? Furthermore, is it possible to pay a monthly or yearly rent, and would it be cheaper?",

I have the internet problem as I rented a studio outside after graduation and it sucked so check the internet speeds where ever you rent before you sign!!!!!!!! I can't even have a youtube video playing on hd without buffer!!!  \n\n\nyou have to pay four months at once if you have a UK guarantor (at least that's how I've paid).   \n\n\nPrivate housing is going to rough and you should start your search soon. Like I've suggested you should go for 88 woodlane.  \n\n\nIf you get 2 flatmates,   \n[https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/88755550#/](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/88755550#/)\n\nthis place is 831 pounds a month. if you have bills over it. it won't go more than a 1000 a month. That's 200 pounds less than what I've paid in gradpad for 19m\\^2 studio. it's also in the top floor.  \n\n\nFrom white city getting imperial will cost the same as from griffon on public transport I don't think you'll walk from griffon mate. Also, there is an imperial shuttle bus which stops at white city gradpad which is right outside 88 woodlane.  \n\n\nCheck it out and get 2 roommates.",

My friend got a warning once because of his echo playing loud music. They take it seriously.\n\nI suggest you to request anything but A-block floor 1 which is above the common room which also isn't a problem my classmate was in that floor and he never had complaint but you can be safe.",

Is your recommendation of Woodlane Vs Griffon (where you recommended Woodlane)  just based on the fact that Woodlane is newer or is the surrounding areas in woodlane studios also preferable to griffon studios?",

    "postText": "So I applied to Imperial for Physics BSc, and my results last year were not the best. I had missed a lot of school in the beginning of the year (due to health issues which I briefly mentionned in PS) and then the whole pandemic happened. Hence, my overall average last year was a (B-). On the other hand, my overall grades this year (senior) are all A\u2019s and A+\u2019s, [ with a 97% in physics]. I\u2019m the only student in my school currently undertaking 7 APs this year. What are my chances of getting into imperial?",

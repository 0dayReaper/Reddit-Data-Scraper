What Accommodation places do you think are best for value? Is it worth looking into Private Accommodation or should I focus more on the Student ones?",

At very least as it's one less thing to worry about. It's guaranteed if you apply before the deadline with Imperial as your firm choice - and well, you're probably going to have to move in with strangers anyway. The rent isn't too bad, and you gain access to all the associated facilities. \n\nThere are some reasons why you might not want to live in hall, but most of those relate to either inelligibility, or exceptional circumstances specific to you.",

None of these accommodations seem particularly bad though, but costume store is definitely worse than the normal two North acton accoms.\n\ndo not put down a place you don't want to go to, you put down 5 options of 1 room and get 1 of them in the end. 'equal chance' but not really; if u put down a hall which is undersubscribed (Xenia . . .) you will likely get it.\n\nsource: im current first year. but in my year i could apply to like 2 different rooms at wood and kemp for very similar prices, the twin rooms were single occupancy and thus only marginally more expensive than a single room. so i put down two wood, two kemp, 1 beit.",

North acton ones (Woodward, kemp porter) are definitely cheaper and nicer, but also in the middle of nowhere. Those in South Kensington are nice, but very very very expensive not worth it imo (Beit might be a cheaper option in campus). Xenia doesn't have the nicest rooms, but it's 5 mins away from London Eye, so the cheaper price is def worth for the location. I don't know about the other hall.",

    "postText": "The eHalls system says that before I arrive I need to \n\na) either register for Cloister Road Surgery (which presumably won\u2019t be processed before I arrive to Woodward, as it lists 5 working days as a limit) \n\nb) or I need to complete and print the Health Centre Registration form. Unfortunately, the link of said document leads to \u201cnot found\u201d page and thus I can not complete nor print it. \n\nI (independently from the eHall links) found a Health Centre online registration form on the page of said Centre but it says I can not complete it before my arrival to the UK - thus I can\u2019t print or complete it either. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience how they completed their own GP registration form? Or does anyone have a working link to said document? \n\nI thank you for your help in advance.",

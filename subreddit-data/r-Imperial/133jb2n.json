    "postText": "So I\u2019ve got an offer from imperial for biochemistry but frankly idk wether I should go or not. It is my best offer, however it\u2019s pretty far from my home (I live in wales) and much more expensive to live in when compared to my other best offer off Bath. I\u2019m applying for biochemistry as well so if anyone has any experience in that course could you let me know what it\u2019s like.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m from rural England, very close to wales (went to school in Chepstow, near Newport) so I can empathise. I was also in your situation with debating taking my offer (I\u2019m also doing biochem)\n\nFor me, I was torn between here and Southampton, and what sealed it for me was visiting the imperial campus and getting a feel for it. I absolutely loved it then and still do now! I knew right away that I liked it much more than southamptons. So if you haven\u2019t visited I highly recommend you do, cos it can make all the difference\n\nLiving in London is fantastic too. Since I come from a very rural town, I was unsure how the transition would be but it\u2019s all gone really really smoothly \n\nIt is expensive but I think you can afford it then it\u2019s worth it\n\nThe course is absolutely fantastic. Lecturers are really nice and approachable and the content is genuinely really interesting and they understand everything in a really nice way. The workload is really really high tho, so don\u2019t expect to get much free time\n\nMy DMs are open if you have any questions about biochem or life here in general :)",

            "comment": "I mean, it\u2019s a complicated question, because it\u2019s so subjective.\n\nFor transport concerns, it\u2019s often important to remember that London has better transport links around the country than basically anywhere else. I don\u2019t know specifically where you are, or what the transport links are like, but often getting to and from london will take *significantly* less time and effort than other areas which are much, much closer. For example, I\u2019m from Newcastle, and my journey home is often shorter than my friends who study at places like Manchester, in terms of time commitment.\n\nAnd although it is more expensive to live in London, there is a more generous student loan amount, and imperial does have one of the most generous bursary schemes in the country, if you\u2019d qualify for those (it made it far more viable for me). There\u2019s also more part time jobs available in London, but you\u2019ve got to balance the time commitment. I have one, and it does make my workload *much* worse, lmao. \n\nBeyond that, most of it is down to you personally. Yes, imperial will offer more prestige, and also a higher level and quality of education. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a debate there - but there are tradeoffs, like the workload, cost etc like you touched upon. It all depends on what you value personally.\n\nI do know a few biochemists (I\u2019m a chemist myself), and they seem to like the course, but again that\u2019s subjective, really! I can\u2019t really offer specific advice there.",

Now living just outside London, and we go in most weekends so the kids can get familiar with it. So much to do, every day out feels like an adventure. I'm still discovering new things.",

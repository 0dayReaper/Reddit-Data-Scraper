    "postText": "\nI am in my first year of IB (Y12) getting 38/42 (not including CORE) points on my first term and on track to continue this way. I also got 9s in my IGCSEs for physics, chemistry, biology and math and 8s in econ and history. I researched the entry requirements for the course I want to study and I am on track to obtaining the entry requirements.\nI was wondering if there is any advice for what I could be doing to improve my chances of getting in. I would like to apply for Beng in biomedical engineering.",

Make sure your PS is strong - ask multiple teachers to comment on it and give you advice. Make sure your recommendation is strong - interact with your teachers and let them know about your future plan. Good luck!",

I think everyone must apply for MEng then can transfer depending on the circumstances.\n\nAnyway, I got the same point as you, and got in. I barely met the requirements for HL subjects, but I guess my personal statement helped me. Put a lot of effort on your personal statement as well as improving your grades if you want to be on a safer side.",

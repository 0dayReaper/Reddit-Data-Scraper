In my cohort almost 50% graduated with 1st and that was considered completely fine\n\nI know there is some pressure from higher ups to tell department if there are too many firsts but i don\u2019t think they act on that in any meaningful way on the next years",

They will moderate up everyone if they can \u201csave\u201d a lot of people from failing or the average getting less than 60% or so. They will moderate down if the average is too high but this is much rarer",

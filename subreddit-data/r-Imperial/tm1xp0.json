    "postText": "Sad_Improvement_8663\n2h\nI got Geology /geophysics in imperial . I got CS in NyuSh. I got CS in Melbourne\n\nActually I am very much interested in imperial . Money is not the criteria. The main point is ...branch .\n\nThe salaries and career in geophysics/geology ? How is compared to CS ? Everybody says CS only have future and lot of salaries .\n\nEven in imperial website , the avg salary in earth sciences &amp; Engg department is 27 K pounds where as CS salary is 40 K per year .\n\nI am getting doubt how the career in geophysics after spending 150 K pounds per degree ... Getting first job is not a issue with Imperial connections . Shall I take decision purely based on college brand and then branch ?\n\nI am undecided student .\n\nI didn't Manchester..people told CS in Edinburgh and Manchester good .\n\nWhat is your opinion on my preference ? What could be best option ?",

I mean it\u2019s not completely trivial to get a degree - if you don\u2019t have at least some drive and fascination you won\u2019t get through. You don\u2019t just \u2018buy\u2019 an IC degree\n\nGeologist jobs are mostly oil and gas, which is going through a slump hence the low salaries.",

Actually I applied Oxford fir earth science ..then Imperial. I was rejected by Oxford and imperial offered based on my interview .\n\nBut I don't have any specific interst  either on CS /earth science . I am average student to be frank . \n\nPeople say , careere opportunities and salaries are very low  for Earth science compared to  CS . \n\nOnly , I am tempting brand of imperial . I can continue PhD also if required . Nyush , people says  must do Masters in US ,then only we get good job .\n\nWhich is best long career and monetary and stable  point of view",

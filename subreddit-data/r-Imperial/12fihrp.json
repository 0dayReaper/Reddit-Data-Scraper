    "postText": "Details:\n\n- I\u2019m an Indian student, it would be my first time studying abroad. I\u2019m looking at student accommodations in these two areas. \n\n- Reaching uni : \nFrom White City - 40 mts by bus \nFrom South Bank - 35mts (15 mt tube ride + walk to/fro tube station)\n\n- Groceries:\nWhite City - 10-15 mt walk\nSouth Bank - right downstairs\n\n- Rent is higher for South Bank but I can afford it, and the rent difference does not affect my decision.\n\nAlso, most students of my uni (Imperial) are planning to stay in White City. I am likely to find students of LSE and Kings in the South Bank accommodation. I believe it would be nice to be around people from different unis, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to feel completely left out :(\n\nWould love to hear about aspects like safety, nightlife, areas to visit, connectivity and overall student experience.",

            "comment": "I am going to Imperial this year as well and you are right, 60% of the people are staying at White City. My advice is that you should go to White City too. Groceries won\u2019t be a problem, everyone living with you will have to commute the same distance so I\u2019m sure you will be able to figure something out as a group. Being in a group is also beneficial for you as a student of Imperial because you will be staying with your own classmates and hence travelling back and forth from college will be less of a hassle. Especially, since it\u2019s your first time, being in a group of people going to the same classes as you will prove to be very convenient. You can even study and do assignments with everyone else. There are a lot of pros.",

I didn't do a Master's at Imperial so I don't know the details, but I have lived in London for 6 years and I've never been to White City. It seems pretty isolated. Southbank is very well connected, with places like Soho being a 30 min walk away so its easy to get home after a night out. A night out in Shoreditch or Camden would be even harder for getting back to White City. Not to mention Southbank itself has a couple good bars/pubs/restaurants (e.g. Bar Elba, Tonight Josephine, King's Arms).",

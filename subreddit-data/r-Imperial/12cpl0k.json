I would live at home later in life (like 3rd year onwards) for financial reasons.\n\nHalls have so many benefits in terms of meeting so many people, getting a feel for how you would like to live with people, learning to cook and clean up after yourself, the works.\n\nAll the halls also organise social events for the accomodation. Those are especially good and fun. When I was at woodward we had a big bbq party with free food and beer every weekend for pretty much all of spring and summer.",

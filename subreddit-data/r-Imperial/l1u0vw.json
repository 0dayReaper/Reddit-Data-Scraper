The October deadline only applies to students applying to Oxford/Cambridge and Medicine/Veterinary/Dentistry courses. \n* You are not forced to go to any of the universities you receive an offer from. However, once you have received decisions on your application you then will accept one offer as a firm, and another as your insurance if you fail to meet the conditions for your firm. All other offers will be automatically declined. Once you submit this, you are expected to attend the firm/insurance choice if you achieve the offer conditions. I think you *can* choose to withdraw and enter Clearing, but hopefully you'd want to go to your firm/insurance choice! The deadline is around June/July so you'll have plenty of time to think.

It is very uncommon for applications to be made to any university without a reference, so you should make sure you can supply a reference with your application if possible. More info: [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/apply/selection/references/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/apply/selection/references/)\n* There is an online admissions test, and you may be invited to an online interview day.

    "postText": " Hey everyone, \n\nI was wondering what the difference is between these two programs? They offer quite similar modules. From program websites, I can see that MSc in Computing has fewer compulsory modules, doesn't require a group project, and has more choices for optional modules.   \n\\+ Looking at the compulsory modules in MSc in AI, I kinda get the feeling that it is more aimed at students with no cs background. \n\nI have BSc in Computer Engineering and at first glance, MSc in Computing seems a better option for me.",

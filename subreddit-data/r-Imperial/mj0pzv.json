I already have an offer, but I don't know if it's worth the risk of the massive debt i'll be taking for it. I seem to be finding not a lot of info on net plus some pretty cynical views as well.",

            "comment": "No, no, no! Absolutely ***NOT***.\n\nPostgraduate degrees (and certificates) are the best way for universities to make money. You will be a \"master\" of none. 40K can be better spent. Especially if it is going to be a remote one, then buy online courses and combine them with actual practical experience, in which you will gain practical ***hard and soft skills***. Start your own projects, start freelancing, ***start networking*** (online meetups or webinars) or find a job (even if it is slightly \"irrelevant\").\n\nUnlike American universities, Imperial will not give you access to a huge network to boost your career. So, undergraduate degrees at Imperial are a wise option, but postgraduate degrees not so much.\n\nThere is only one case that a Master's degree ***might*** be worth it: To land a job in another country (e.g. in the US).\n\nThe typical formula to see if a degree is worth it is to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI): \n\n***ROI = (Amount Gained - Amount Spent)/(Amount Spent)***\n\nWHERE:\n\nAmount Spent = Twelve months of \"lost\" salaries + Tuition fees + Extra accommodation or other fees (which you wouldn't normally have if not taking the course)\n\nAmount Gained = Amount of money that you will get in the next 5 (or so) years WITH the degree - Amount of money that you would get WITHOUT the degree\n\nRead more here: https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/08/20/the-roi-of-a-university-degree-is-it-worth-it/",

    "postText": "Has anyone ever contacted the Department Disability Officer? Do you have any advice as to what to expect?\n\nI won't go into much detail but I suspect I have ADHD. There have been some things bothering me for the past years and I never sought help, but after today's exam I realised I need to talk to someone about this because it is affecting my performance during exams (I almost failed 2 exams already because I lost focus for long periods of time). Honestly I do not know if they will be able to help me in time for the incoming exams, but it's worth trying. Has anyone tried to talk to the Department Disability Officer? I also don't know if they can help me now that I am not in the UK. I am a bit scared (for no reason honestly, I'm just scared) and I just need to see that it worked out for someone else. I already contacted my personal tutor today explaining the situation and asking her what to do next, now I'm waiting for a reply.\n\nThank you!\n\nPS: one of the reasons I am a bit scared is that they will say that I'm only doing this for attention and extra time. I admit that I should have been braver sooner and contacted them a while back, but the last 2 exams really scared the shit out of me because I really studied for them and I then completely lost it. I think this is because in my country \"mental illnesses don't really exist, they are just for attention\" and the mentality that we have here made me skeptical about a lot of things that are different in other countries.\n\nUpdate: I talked to my PT and DDO and I have a SpLD screening in 2 weeks. Both of them told me to apply to mitigating circumstances, so I did that for that particular exam, we'll see how it goes.",

            "comment": "Hey I contacted them for a mental illness I have but I already got a doctor\u2019s note for my diagnosis so the process was really quick. I got extra time for my exams which really helped me. Did all the process online (emails and teams meetings) so it should not be a problem that you\u2019re not in the UK. Do reach out to them and the student mental health team, imperial has really good resources that you should really make use of. Good luck! :)",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the reply! I'm glad they were able to help you! It might be a little trickier for me because I've never been to a psychologist and they will probably need to make sure I actually need extra time before giving it to me (which makes sense, I'm not mad about it). And I found the worst time to seek help: during exams!\n\nAlso the reason why I thought maybe they can't help me when I'm not in the UK is because I tried to get an appointment with a doctor from the health centre regarding something else and they told me that their doctors are not allowed to call students outside UK. I thought maybe the same rule applies in general, I guess I'll see.",

I also came from a third world country that does not believe mental health is a real thing, but the UK is different and they would not think you\u2019re an attention seeker if you tell them your current condition. I nearly dropped out cause I was so stressed and failing my exams despite studying for it like crazy...it might be too late for this season\u2019s exam but for the next ones it would help you a lot so do try. It\u2019s 100 worth the effort to try. My guess is that if you talked to them they would ask you to find a doctor in your current country to give you a diagnosis and then the process from the disability team is super fast, you just talk to one disability officer about arrangements you would like and they do all the work.",

            "comment": "Contact them as soon as possible. They'll explain the whole process to you well. Also book an appointment with the disability advisory service (DAS). They can get you a diagnostic assessment for much less money than it would cost otherwise. Because of covid they aren't running them right now but they can put you on the waiting list so definitely contact them soon. I don't know if they count as an official diagnosis but it enables a lot more support through the college. \n\nYour disability advisor may suggest putting in a mitigating circumstances claim for these exams and you can meet with them to discuss it. They prefer evidence like a doctors note but you can self evidence if this isn't possible. The deadline for a mitigating circumstances claim is 10 days after the end of the exam period so be quick to get in contact. There's no guarantee a claim will be successful but it's worth a shot.\n\nI'm in a very similar situation and everyone has been really helpful. Make sure to arrange a meeting with your disability officer and book an appointment with DAS ASAP. You may not get any help for these exams but you should be able to get support in place for future exams.",

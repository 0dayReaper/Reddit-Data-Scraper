Dunno anything about the south ken accom other than Beit is very loud",

And, the living rooms/kitchens make for excellent movie nights or other events with your flatmates. In the covid-era, we especially grew closer to our flatmates and made great close friends as well (in my experience) which is always welcome, thanks to all the facilities allowing such interactions. And it's all for a relatively very cheap price. You also have a Tesco and Sainsbury's Local right at the doorstep and an Asda 20 mins away. \nAll in all, I've had some of my best time there.",

Plus the rent is much cheaper than living in SK, as well as having plenty of cheap shops nearby (little Tesco and Sainsbury's right near and a huge 24 hour Asda about 20 mins away). Only real downside to North Acton is the distance from campus and the journey into uni.\n\nIf you end up in North Acton I'd advise getting a student oyster card and a zone 2 travelcard as it'll save you a lot of travel expenses",

Travel cards give you unlimited travel in that period (i.e a month in my case). Not sure what the price is now but it's probably no more than \u00a3115. While this is quite a lot, you probably save that money with the cheaper rent.",

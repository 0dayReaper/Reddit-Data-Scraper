    "postText": "I am an Indian student who received an offer from Imperial College London for Engineering Fall 2021. The tuition fees per year is about 33,000 GBP, along with additional living expenses of living in London, amounting to about 150-250 GBP per week. I am aware it is a highly reputed university, but the international tuition fee is really high. My parents are ready to pay the amount, but I am sure it's not going to be an easy job considering my brother is also studying in the US at the same time. \n\nIs it worth paying so much to attend ICL? Or is settling for a more affordable university for undergraduate going to yield a similar outcome, provided I work hard during those four years. \n\nPS: I assume most classes are going to be online this year owing to COVID, so I am also contemplating on if the fees is worth it to spend a large part of university online. \n\nAny advice would be highly appreciated!",

It also depends on the course you are doing, for something like computing or another selective course it is more worth it.",

London is expensive, and though, that's true, but in the end it will be worth it. In terms of online teaching, don't worry, you still have access to library and facilities, and in-person teaching will happen no later than January 2022.",

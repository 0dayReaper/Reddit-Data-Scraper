    "postText": "Hi I may be coming to imperial provided I meet my offer and was just curious where most people end up living in London after their first year on an undergrad degree?\n\nDo people move into houses with any other students? If so whereabouts in London and typically when in the first year do they start making these arrangements?",

            "comment": "So, it varies a bit depending on course, and where your course is primarily based. If you\u2019re a medic for example you\u2019ll be deeper into hammersmith (near charing cross hospital) probably.\n\nSome will do private student accomodation, or become hall seniors in Imperial accommodation, but those are definitely a minority.\n\nBy and large, people will form groups of roughly 3-5 people, and rent privately in London. Generally in Hammersmith, Fulham, sometimes up by Paddington, West Kensington, or if you have a bigger budget maybe Chelsea or South Ken itself. Some are also much further out in areas like Acton or White City where it\u2019s a bit cheaper, but that\u2019s only really viable longer term (it\u2019s realistically fine for halls - the North Acton halls are the nicest and basically cheapest fyi) if your course is based out of the White City campus.\n\nIn terms of when people do this, it varies a LOT. London has an active housing market all year round - unlike a lot of student cities where there will only be student houses available for a few months of the year.\n\nSome people will group up and book accommodation in november/december of first year, but most do it in the latter half of second term or early third term. So like, between march and june. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that \u2018student contracts\u2019 for term-time only tend not to exist all that much in London, compared to some other cities. You will almost certainly be on a full 12 month contract. \n\nAnd honestly, this isn\u2019t really something you need to worry about yet. If you come here, you don\u2019t need to worry about this until like six months into the academic year. Take the time to find good friends, be it from your flat in Halls, or your course, or societies, and take the time to get to know them properly before booking accommodation.\n\nHope you have a great time at uni mate! \ud83d\ude03",

Also, I found it much easier to find a place for large groups when searching early on (Nov/Dec of first year), while for 1-2 people it\u2019s more feasible to look closer to the moving in date.",

I distinctly remember juggling revision and house viewing.\n\nNearly all my friends lived in the Hammersmith/ Fulham/ Shepherd's Bush areas. One group lived in Bayswater, one lived in Imperial Wharf but everyone resented travelling to visit them!",

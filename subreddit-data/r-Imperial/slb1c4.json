Also found out that getting the admission test is like the second step in applying, BUT not everyone gets it, so it's a good sign we got it :). I am totally terrified.",

If you live in a time zone that causes the test time to be in the middle of the night, email\n\n\nThis was the initial part of the email I got, it later goes on about the readiness test and the Blackboard platform.\nI also talked with some professionals on admissions and confirmed me that this is a good sign.",

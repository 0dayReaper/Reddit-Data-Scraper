    "postText": "I've been advised not to include anything other than computer science in my personal statement since Computing is such a competitive course, especially for Imperials. However, the video from Imperials about admissions did actually ask for me to include personal hobbies and stuff. I would really like to include the fact that I make short films (since I feel that it makes me unique, and I've actually gotten pretty successful with it), but my personal statement is filled to the brim with technical stuff about computer science and is just focused on showing my interest towards the subject. I asked my principal to include my film hobbies in her reference letter, is that enough, or will I have to try to fit it into my personal statement?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owuujv3o0js91.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a8a5badae2e76eaeda0d0c98aaa138ec40c9de3a",

Include the short film and what you like doing in spare time like sports or anything you do for fun. Keep it professional though don\u2019t be like for fun I like going out to drink \ud83d\ude02",

Or any volunteering you have done or any computer stuff you do for fun. Hopefully you figure it out. You can always show your ucas or statement to your student reps if you have one. I am sure there are services who can check it for you too",

I said playing badminton diverts my mind and freshens me up to have a better capacity to think clearly when problem solving in maths/CS. Something like that..\n\nEdit: Also, side note: CS at imperial can be RNG. Way too many strong applications; don\u2019t be disheartened if you don\u2019t get in with a flawless application. And don\u2019t be put off if your application isn\u2019t as strong as some others\u2019. Good luck :)",

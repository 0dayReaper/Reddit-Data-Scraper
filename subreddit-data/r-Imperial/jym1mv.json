    "postText": "The title is deceptive as I'm aware that this process is practically non-exisistant at IC but might as well give it a shot.\n\nTLDR: So I'm currently first year Design Engineering and I'm just finding that the course is a) really, really easy and b) just a bit bland. I'm not, not enjoying the course but I think I could get a bit of a better time somewhere else. I'm a bit of a work-aholic so having a really easy course especially really gets on my nerves daily.\n\nI was thinking of transfering to either mecheng or EEE. I was wondering if anyone else has gone through this process and if it is actually existant. I have very good grades (easy course lmao) and just wanted to know if this is an option.\n\nThanks guys!",

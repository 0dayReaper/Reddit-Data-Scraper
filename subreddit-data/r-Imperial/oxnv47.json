    "postText": "Hi - I am keen on applying to the Business Analytics program at Imperial and was looking into applying for Fall 2022 semester. \n\nI received an email from Imperial stating that the admission for the program for this fall is still open until the 6th of August.\n\nI was wondering if it is reasonable to submit my application and see if I have a shot. I haven\u2019t done my gmat yet, and frankly I don\u2019t have any supporting doc (however it is stated that supporting docs are not required for the program). \n\nMy background: 25F engineer from Lebanon, with around 3 years of experience in Engineering.",

            "comment": "Yes, I think you should apply and try to submit the supporting documents as soon as you can. Even if the program is competitive and you think it might be full, you may be put on the reserve list and get a spot at the last minute when someone chooses not to take their offer (this is what happened to me last week, and I know someone that got an pffer last year as late as september). I am not sure it you\u2019ll need the gmat, my course didn\u2019t. You may be required to take the toefl if your first degree wasn\u2019t taught in english, but you can always figure that out later as they can make it a condition in your offer of admission. Good luck :)",

You should check if you really need it, if your score is not higher than the average for the program don\u2019t send it in. Check the admission webpage.",

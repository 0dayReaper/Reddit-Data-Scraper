    "postText": " \n\nHey guys, I am an Indian student and I study in the CBSE Curriculum. My predicted grades for 12th Board Exam standard is 94. In 9th, 10th, and 11th I scored 73, 95, 73 respectively. I am applying for the BSc Computer Science course in Imperial College London. My two best achievements in CS are - getting a perfect score of 100 in 10th Board Exam and scoring 100 in the International CodeCombat Quiz organised by Premier Genie. My personal statement wasn't too bad either. My dip in grades is cuz I've studied in 3 different countries, 3 different boards across 5 cities (I have studied in London for 5 yrs, Mumbai for 4 yrs, and this is my 2nd year in Dubai).....it takes time to settle...ya know impressing teachers, getting used to the curriculum and all. But my interest and love for computer science have not been affected cuz of this. I am even practising some competitive coding questions on HackerRank and I have done virtual internships from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs as a software engineer intern. (took about 7-8 hours each). I have good LORs from my Math and Comp Sci Teachers too. I am currently working on making an app related to making custom football tournaments and other related stuff. I know Java, Python and SQL and have done projects in each of them.\n\nCOULD YALL PLZ RATE MY CHANCES OF GETTING INTO IMPERIALCOLLEGE LONDON........IM FREAKING OUT!!",

If you\u2019ve got a solid personal statement it WILL be read, and if your grades aren\u2019t miles below what they want they will probably give you a chance at interview - Imperial does a LOT of interviews. And if you interview well you\u2019ll no doubt get an offer. You\u2019ve just gotta try and do your best!\n\n(Source : First year Chem student at Imperial rn \ud83d\ude03)",

The two biggest blocks are both brand new - Kemp Porter just opened this year (where I\u2019m at) and Woodward is just a few years old - they both house about... 600 people in KP and similar in woodward I think? I hear the accommodation on campus (WW and KP are a moderate distance away, but newer and MUCH cheaper) is really nice too! \n\nAnd good luck, hope you get in! \ud83d\ude03",

I am extremely worried about this offer so my first question is does anyone know why imperial would give me an increased offer of 3 A\\* and my second question is how lenient is Imperial on missing a grade.",

            "comment": "I think most offers this year are higher than expected ( it\u2019s certainly the case for me anyway) The increased offer is probably because they anticipate a large grade inflation due to the teacher predicted grades. It is still possible to be given a place but it probably depends on the competition for the course and how much the department wants you to go.",

That meant my year wasn\u2019t really over-subscribed, but next year has a lot of students waiting on places so the competition is gonna be fierce",

Realistically it'll be the same thing this year round but honestly who knows, I think that this year they might be more lenient because the situation is more predictable than last year.",

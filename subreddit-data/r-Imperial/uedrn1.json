            "comment": "Hi! I've confirmed materials science for autumn. I chose it because I'm ultimately looking for a city job in consulting or finance, where your major doesn't really matter. Anyhow, it's seen as an engineering degree same as the others, so you get a bit of background in maths, programming, chemistry, etc. For city jobs, Imperial is a target school and studying engineering shows you're clever, and the maths you learn may be applicable if you want to be a quant.\n\nYou may have difficulty applying for the same jobs as mechanical and aerospace students because materials science is a bit more niche and you won't necessarily have the same training as them. There are careers in research you can go for as a materials scientist, but these opportunities are less plentiful than engineering ones. Imperial's research in this space is very high-quality and undergraduates have opportunities to partake in research over the course of their degree.\n\nWorkload-wise, all of the Imperial courses are listed on their website as being 1500 hours of work a year, probably a lowball estimate, but you may have more lab hours than a mechanical engineer who may have more hours in a workshop.",

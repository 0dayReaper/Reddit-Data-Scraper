A few of my housemates also tutored over the years. \n\nAlso for my master's, half the cohort were working full time (it was only 1-2 contact days a week, one of the few 'humanities' offerings at Imperial).\n\nCompletely normal to work while at uni!",

Worst comes to worse they'll just tell you to apply when there's next a hiring round (and there usually is early in the year when they realise how woefully understaffed they are!)\n\nThis is for bar work. Through the bar work I started working as the events supervisor for the Beit building.",

Then look out for any in David Nutt's lab for a really good time :))",

Shifts range from a 5-6 hour day shift through to a 9-10 hour night on Wednesday or Friday. \n\nDuring term time you're \"limited\" to 20 hours a week. University rule. However if people wanted to work more they usually could. Very rare they pull you up on it if you do want to work more.\n\nPay was not very good, but I was mostly doing it for beer money and just cos I enjoyed it, so it was fine by me. I worked there for almost 5 years and when I left (2018) I was paid ~\u00a38.10p/h as bar staff, \u00a39.20 as a supervisor. Even then that wasn't great, and you'll only get tipped by the Americans.",

These halls are more expensive (and imo not worth it) anyway\n\nWilson is a 5 minute walk from the Imperial medics gym at the hospital which you can join, and is often quiet. I think the halls in acton also have gyms as a part of the building (and are way cheaper, though you do have to take the tube to get to uni/london, so travel &amp; time costs may negate that)\n\nin any case, you can get a membership at the gym, puregym etc for ~20/month as a student, and they\u2019re everywhere in london\n\nI\u2019m also a bit unsure about why you want to share a room with someone else? From my time at uni, I never heard anyone say that they would\u2019ve preferred sharing over having a single room - even those who chose to be in shared rooms. The general thing I heard from them was that they wanted an easy friend or a cheaper room when they put their choices, but once they arrived found that 1. it was easy to make friends just by going hanging out in the kitchen / at lectures / the uni bars / societies / the common room  (everyone is looking for friends, especially in the first few weeks when you arrive) 2. if you wanted a cheaper room, you should just go to the cheaper halls (i understand money is very tight for some, but i assume this may not be your case since you have not mentioned this)",

If money is one of your main limiting factors I\u2019d recommend just doing the maths in a spreadsheet factoring in transport to/from uni, food costs etc. \n\nSouth/eastside &amp; beit are probably no gos, idk the price structure but I would think you\u2019re better off getting a single in acton than a shared in s ken \n\nWilson you can walk/cycle to uni quickly\n\nActon halls you have to take the tube (maybe you could cycle, but it may be along a fairly busy road + everyone else in halls will be tubing and you\u2019ll likely want to join). i think groceries could be slightly cheaper as you have access to the big asda, all the other halls only have small, more expensive tesco express",

Of course they could be changing them back to twin but if you want twin for it to be cheaper make sure to check that. With single occupancy twins are more expensive than singles.",

Both were single ensuite rooms. \n\nIn first year, I stayed at Woodward. It is pretty far from campus (~50 min commute by tube, ~\u00a3100 per month) but it was crazy cheap, and the room and kitchen was both very modern and very nice. No college gym close by but there was a private one that I think we had a deal with, a lot of my friends used it. \n\nThis year, I\u2019m staying at Beit right across from campus. It is a bit expensive, but still cheap compared to any other option anywhere near campus. It is an older building (the oldest hall afaik) so you don\u2019t get the modern rooms but I don\u2019t really have any major complaints. One possible issue with Beit is that it shares the bulding with the student union and its venues (a pub and a club.) This can be a double edged sword, if you like going out and go to many events, it is extremely convenient. But if you don\u2019t, it is quite noisy and don\u2019t expect to be able to sleep before 12 most days and 2am on most Friday-Saturday nights if your room is looking into the quad. I personally don\u2019t mind it much, I\u2019m not an early sleeper anyways and I like the convenience. If necessary, I can just use some earplugs and go to sleep if I have an early morning the next day.",

            "comment": "Honestly, imperial halls depend so much on your budget, and your specific desires out of a place to live.\n\nIf by twin room, you mean \u2018sharing with another student\u2019 (as in, two beds in the same room), I believe the only hall which has that is Kemp Porter - but those rooms might be single occupancy still (they were during the pandemic - I had one, was great, lmao). If you just meant a \u2018twin bed\u2019 as in the bed size though, ignore that bit.\n\nPeople mentioned gyms - it\u2019s important to note imperial doesn\u2019t JUST have Ethos as a gym. Unless it\u2019s changed, the North Acton halls had Igym right next door, which had a partnership with Imperial, and made membership pretty cheap (I want to say \u00a340 for the year, but it\u2019s been a while). There\u2019s Reynolds, at the Charing Cross campus (which you can get access to with an Ethos membership), which is I think close to Parsons? Or was that Wilson? I forget. And then there\u2019s Westway (everyoneactive) near White City, which isn\u2019t too far out from North Acton - and probably isn\u2019t too bad from the halls in Paddington (the other one out of Parsons and Wilson, I forget which is which). And then there\u2019s Ethos of course for Beit, southside, etc.\n\nIn terms of the halls themselves, realistically the halls in North Acton are the newest, and nicest to live in, and are also fairly cheap. It\u2019s a 45 or so minute commute however, and North Acton is a bit shit, so that\u2019s the downside there.\n\nThe halls on campus are far more expensive, and as I understand it Southside is the nicer out of them, but I didn\u2019t personally live there or even visit. Beit is alright, but is a bit old, and being at the union can be a bit of a problem on rare occasions I hear.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re on a budget, or just want a cleaner, more modern living space, I\u2019d look at Kemp Porter and Woodward. If money\u2019s no object, then one of the halls on campus (beit/southside etc) is probably your best bet. Wilson and Parsons are sort of a halfway house - not as bad a commute, not quite as expensive. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve really missed anything there? But yeah! \n\nAlso worth noting you have to pick FIVE options, and you get randomly allocated one out of those - no preference order. Unless they\u2019ve changed it since I joined!",

                            "comment": "As far as I know, not many of them do have twins - a \u2018twin bed\u2019 is a size of bed here in the UK, which is probably what the website is referring to. You get \u2018single\u2019 and \u2018twin\u2019 mattress sizes, and they\u2019re probably just mentioning on the website that they all have options for people to have the bigger \u2018twin\u2019 bed size if they\u2019re willing to pay for it.\n\nAs far as I know, the only dual occupancy rooms are at Kemp Porter, and there\u2019s like ninety of them. They were also single occupancy up to and including this academic year - this may have changed for your intake year, but I honestly doubt it. It\u2019s relatively unlikely that *any* rooms are \u2018two people to one room\u2019 right now at Imperial.\n\nI\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re an international student, and just mention that in the UK, actually sharing your bedroom itself is *really uncommon* at university. We don\u2019t really do that, like at all. What we do instead, is have \u2018flats\u2019 (or, I suppose, apartments, but \u2018flat\u2019 is more descriptive here) where there are a cluster of bedrooms, and a shared kitchen/common area for each cluster of rooms. You\u2019ll all be on one corridor, all with your own private spaces (less interpersonal conflict that way, and it\u2019s less catastrophic if you don\u2019t get on with somebody), but with those shared common areas - plus bathrooms if you\u2019re in non-ensuite accommodation. \n\nIt means you still get a lot of the benefits of sharing a room with somebody - you\u2019re kept in close proximity to a small group of people, which gives you good opportunities to build some good friendships, as you\u2019ll all need to use the common areas to cook, eat, watch TV, play games, whatever. But, you have your own private space, and *full use* of that private space. \n\nI get the impression that in a lot of the world, the \u2018Uni Experience\u2019 is more a continuation of school - living in big dorms, food cooked for you in canteens, fixed, rigid class schedules, strict enforcement, etc. - whereas the \u2018Uni Experience\u2019 in the UK is moreso treated as the \u2018start of actual adulthood\u2019. You get all the respect of an adult, with a bit of leeway so you can figure things out. But you get your own privacy, generally have few rules/regulations about the use of your private space (so long as you\u2019re not disrupting others), will not be chased for missed classes, whatever. It\u2019s on you, for good or bad. \n\nApologies if you\u2019re not international, and I just student-splained the shit out of stuff you already know, but I hope that helped haha",

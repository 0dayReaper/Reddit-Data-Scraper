    "postText": "Hey! I'm coming to campus after attending the first year online. So, I'm not eligible for most of the college accomodation. I don't know a lot of people and am reluctant to bunk with others.\nI'm looking at private student halls, and studios posted on the home solutions site. What would you suggest I go for?\nI would love to receive advice and experience that you may have based on your accomodation solution. Thank you.",

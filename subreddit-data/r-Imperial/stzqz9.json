    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI applied for Msc Computing AI/ML specialism on the 09/12/2021. From there , I received an update saying the application was going to be passed to the department at the end of december, but didn\u2019t hear back since then. As more than 8 weeks have passed by (time they aim to come back with a decision), do you think I should try to reach them? I am also aware that due to christmas holidays they might take a bit longer than expected, and I don\u2019t want to annoy them.",

They said they\u2019d forward my query to the dept. Heard absolutely nothing back. I sent a follow up email to the dept a week after and only got an auto-reply, no response or even an acknowledgment that they\u2019re checking. \n\nTbh I think it\u2019s high key rude. They literally say we should expect a decision in 6-8 weeks. Why even introduce that expectation if there\u2019s no effort to try to meet it?",

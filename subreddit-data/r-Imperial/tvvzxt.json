Given that I have a budget of around 300 pounds per week, and I really want to live nearer to the campus. Are there any seniors at Imperial can give me any recommendation of which one I should choose? \n\nSo far I personally prefer the single ensuite at Southside Hall. How is that?",

First of all, the cost of studying abroad is almost at the same level, no matter in Hongkong, China, or in UK, US. Perhaps in London it costs more, but it doesn't make huge difference. Secondly, Imperial has one of the most renowned and comprehensive education in science and engineering. Its quality is among the highest all over the world, and the study is intense too. After graduation, you can apply for top postgraduate programs relatively easily in US and UK. But if you choose to attend unis with lower rankings, it is incredibly hard even if you earn the highest GPA. As a Chinese, I would have chosen to attend domestic unis if the quality gap is not that big. The reason why I choose to leave my home and go out of the comfort zone is the high quality education provided by Imperial. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I think Imperial is worth your while. You can apply for scholarship afterwards I guess, not necessarily by the time when you enter the school. I almost have no idea about the scholarship. But you can take reference from the website of Imperial, some info there may help you.",

I know NYUSH and CHHK. They are both top unis in China. If you get in either one, you will be competing with thousands of intelligent chinese students who are really really hardworking and good at sciences, as you've mentioned. There are a few things you should consider. \n\n1. GPA. It could be incredibly hard for you if you couldn't understand chinese, given that your classmates are all academically strong. \n2. Courses and durations. Given that there are so many students competing to choose some hot courses, you are very likely not to get into the class you wish. Meanwhile, generally speaking, in China it takes 4 years to achieve Bachelor's degree and 3 years to achieve master's degree. The duration is very long, compared to 4 years taken by MSci program at Imperial. \n3. Acceptance by top US postgraduate programs. China's education system is not as closely linked to that of US as that of UK. And it is definitely harder to apply for postgrad in US than that you graduate from Imperial. Compared to Imperial, you have less research opportunity, less academic environment, less internship opportunity, less chance to meet renowned professors to write a recommendation letter, and perhaps lower quality of education. It is also harder to complete GRE and TOEFL exams if you live in a non-English-speaking environment. \n\nOverall, although it is clear that chinese university is more financially suitable for you, I'd say Imperial may be a better choice if you could make it up by winning scholarships. If you have to choose between NYUSH and CUHK, I'd personally prefer NYUSH. My girlfriend has studied at NYUSH for her freshman year due to the pandemic (she was admitted to NYU and she would go abroad with me this Sept). NYUSH has an environment pretty much like a US top uni, and it overall works just like NYU in NYC. You won't need to worry about the problems above that much. But because you are taking science major, I still recommend you to go to Imperial if it's possible, due to its quality of education, recognition, ranking, and other countless advantages over the other two options.",

CS major students get high salary compared to other majors.\nSo I requested change major in imperial, they have not agreed . This is also one of main reasons ..not able to take decision . \n\nFurther , I understood with little reaserch.the salaries in UK top universities oxbridge, ICL,UCL,ED has avg salary for graduates is 30K pounds (As per their official website ). CS major 40 to 50 K.  I still couldnt understand , why salaries are low even in oxbrige ,ICL compared to US .\nIn US , even in Avg university they get 80 K / year ( Even if u consider exchange rate difference ) , Huge difference ... This is always answer less question ...even after 10 years exp in UK, They get 100 K.  \nIn US , Double the salary .    \nIf you see Edinburg university website , Informatics department avg salary is only 30 K . If we go same ranked or lower ranked university   , they get 80 to 90 K avg .\nTax also high in UK. Living cost high in london. \n\nAm I missing any point /logic ?\n\nFurther , I got University of maryland without aid. CS major . They show 95 K avg salary ...CS rank is 16 in US as per US news . But i didn't get scholarship.\n\nAm I missing any point ?\nWhy so much difference in salaries?\n\nStill , why people going oxbridge , ED, ICL ?  This question always in my mind. Why UK has half of the salary compared to US even if we study very hard in UK?",

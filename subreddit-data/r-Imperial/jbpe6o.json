    "postText": "Hi, I'm trying to apply to Meng Aeronautical Engineering this year, and just curious about the criteria for Canadian students (although it says at least five 85-90 senior courses and overall 85-90). I got A+ in pre-calc, chem, and computer science and an A in Economics last year, and I'm quite sure I'll get A+ in calc and physics this year (90-100% is considered as A+ in our school since our regular curriculum is harder than the other countries, but I still got over 95 and high 90s for these subjects). Also, I'm going to take AP Calculus BC, AP Physics 1, Physics C: mech, and chemistry this year. The thing is my English grade is super low compared to other subjects, which is around 70 I think. Do you think this is gonna be a matter?",

    "postText": "1. I am an International student who got an offer for civil engineering at both Imperial and University of Waterloo(UW)(Canada) and currently undecided on which one to choose. The co-op program at UW is really appealing and just wanted to know if it would be wise to choose Waterloo over Imperial.\n\nConsidering as well:\n- Cost is cheaper at waterloo, but not a major problem\n- Work-life balance seems to be somewhat a little better at Waterloo\n- Campus life and lesser commuting time at Uni of waterloo (compared to some imperial halls)\n- On the flip side, nearly no holidays at UW due to co-op terms compared to Imperial\n- BEng including coop at UW (5yrs) and MEng at Imperial (4yrs) but not much an issue\nNot taking other factors into consideration such as weather, distance from home country... and\n\n2. Do you guys think that having work experience is crucial for engineering? Given the co-op opportunity at UW\n\n3. Also, a lot of people say that the workload can be overbearing at times at Imperial. Is it that the content is difficult to grasp or that you have a lot of assignments/work?",

If you want to look at Canada and possibly getting citizenship there, choose University of Waterloo. Imperial is better known in global circles and rated higher, but Waterloo has great programs and you might end up having better luck finding work later on in Canada. Engineering is licensed in most places, so consider where you would like to be, long term. Also note that London is a much more vibrant place to live in than Waterloo, Ontario!",

At imperial life is harder in every aspect, with the trade off being that you have a lot of opportunity to get to big industry fast (and the imperial name goes a long way). If you want to work in Canada as well, consider that you will have to go through a degree recognition process (I am guessing, not Canadian so idk).",

But  for engineering degrees, term time is just a little more than 6 months (given the summer term is just on one small project). Like my engineering friends have 7 weeks of spring break (before their exams) and obviously standard 3 months of summer with no college coursework.\n\nHowever it really depends from person to person, like some people actively participate in CSPs and achieve a 1st.\nAlso I've lived in Canada but if u ask me if say the uk&gt;&gt;",

            "comment": "Work experience integrated with the course is not necessary, especially if you are studying at Imperial. Your student visa will allow you to do internships during the summer holiday. You shouldn't have too much trouble securing one between the summers after your 2nd and 3rd years (internships after 1st year tend to be less common). \n\nThe workload comes in waves, but there are points when it is quite a lot. However, you will be studying at one of the best universities in the world for civil engineering, so you should expect to be pushed. The course is small (usually ~100 students per year) and you will know everyone in your year. When deadline time is approaching everyone is in the same boat, and some of my most memorable moments at Imperial are the late night group coursework submissions or revising in the library and seeing your classmates dotted around the 5th floor.  Everyone looks out for each other, so you will never be completely stuck on any coursework, and there will always be a handful of people who always leave it until the very last minute -- trust me from experience!! \n\nDon't put too much weight on where the halls are located, you will only be there for your first year. After that you can live as close or as far as you wish! \n\nThe course at Imperial is fantastic. You will learn the tried and tested fundamentals of civil engineering but importantly you will put them into practice throughout the course, often in partnership with visiting lecturers from industry. \n\nThere were times when I really struggled at Imperial, but (even with COVID) it was an incredible experience that I unreservedly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity. Happy to answer any other questions you might have.",

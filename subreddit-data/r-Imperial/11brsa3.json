I don't want to create any false expectations, but I can't think of a reason why they would contact me if they weren't. \n\nCan you provide any insight if you have a similar situation?",

Imperial's admission process works in a holistic way and they evaluate every aspect of your records before making a decision. The admissions department won't just go through one detail and reject, that's not how it works",

As long as you are outgoing and make the effort to be friends, you will maks friends. \n\nThis *is* harder outside of halls because in halls, seeing your friends usually just means a 10 second walk to a kitchen on your floor. And can happen whenever. You can do even small things like watching TV together with ease, and that really helps. Also halls forces you to make new friends, just out of proximity and easier living, which is great.\n\n\nBut harder =/= impossible. I have friends who commuted to imperial and they were all sociable enough and had no problems making friends.\n\n\n\n\nIn the real world?\n\n\nI'll be honest, I think this first year for freshers will be awful. No physical freshers events, everyone will be reserved because this year's fresher's flu could be a spicy one, fewer physical reasons to be in university... it's going to be hard. Especially outside of halls where again, proximity forces some friendships.\n\nBut *everyone's* in the same boat. And when things do normalise, as long as you are out there, joining societies and going to events and meeting people, you'll get past it and make friends fine.\n\n\nEnjoy your first year. I do 100% recommend at least spending one year away from home in a student house. It is a really big learning step to live independent of the comforts you're used to, and with great housemates.",

It's kind of annoying since my parents don't wish to pay for my accomodation because I live so close to imperial, but then again I understand. Thanks a lot for the message, I have a couple of friends going to imperial so I'm probably gonna chill in their halls most of the time out of lectures/seminars etc",

Then, I check if the user is still active on reddit, if he is I message them and ask for my advice. I am aspiring to do CS, and since I'm in yr 11, I find the advice useful. This technique is surprisingly successful, as I have used this way to get advice as well as see personal statements for CS applicants for Oxford, Imperial, UCL and many more who got offers.",

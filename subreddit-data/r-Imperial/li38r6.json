            "comment": "Well, I can tell you about the fall term. \n\n5 core courses:\nIntro to Computer hardware: logic gates, boolean algebra, hardware components, final state machines, etc. Basically you try to design a processor from scratch.\nMath 1: math analysis, linear algebra\nLogic: propositional logic, first order logic\nDiscrete Math: sets, relations, functions, proofs, etc.\nComputer Practical: haskell, kotlin, ethics project.\n\nAs for the spring term, we start with Java in computer Practical. If you want to know more about the courses and about the summer term, a second year will probably be more knowledgeable.\n\nLet me know if you want to know more!",

            "comment": "For spring term you have:   \nComputer Architecture: cpu design with cost/efficiency considerations and assembly code.   \nReasoning About Programs: applying logical predicates learnt in fall term to construct arguments about haskell and java programs. In particular you'll look at mathematical/structural induction, pre/post conditions and loop invariants  \nDatabases: Database design, SQL, database schema, functional dependencies, etc  \nGraphs and Algorithms: Data structures, algorithm complexity, NP completeness, common algorithms such as Dijkstras, A\\*, depth first search, sorting algorithms and searching, etc  \nProgramming: Java with a focus on object oriented design and concurrency and an ethics project\n\nFor summer term: You will have exams in each module including programming. You will then spend 3 or so weeks learning C and completing a group project.",

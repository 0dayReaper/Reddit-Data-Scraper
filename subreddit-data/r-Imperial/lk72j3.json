    "postText": "Hi, \nI was pretty late in submitting my UCAS application ( like the deadline is 15th Jan and I submitted it on 15th Jan ). I received an email regarding an online test that I was supposed to give. I have my test on 4th Feb. I still didn\u2019t receive any message regarding my application or some interview. How long does it usually take to get a call for an interview ? Or should I have revived a call by now and so some bad news is on the way ? \nImperial is my first choice of college and I\u2019ve been wanting to attend it for a long time. Its giving me grave anxiety to the point I am considering therapy (I know this sounds crazy but it\u2019s my dream and I worked really hard for it and I\u2019m not very good with rejection). Can someone please tell me if you\u2019ve been through something similar ?",

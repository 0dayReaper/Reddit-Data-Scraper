I am very grateful for this opportunity, but I am scared that it will be too academically challenging, and the social life will be bad. Can anyone give their personal experiences studying at imperial college London so that I can have a better picture of how it will be there?",

Yes you have to work more than other unis, but you also get a better education and a more reputable degree. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to also think about your other options/offers and what post-graduation opportunities you are losing/gaining by going somewhere else. Personally, I chose to transfer to an easier/less reputable course after getting an initial offer - after graduating I now regret this. I probably enjoyed my time at uni more, but have since been paying the price with extra work in order to get jobs/post grad opportunities that I want, as well as feeling regret about not pushing myself to fulfil my potential and taking the easy route. In certain fields (particularly STEM related) it\u2019s not uncommon to see teams that are 80%+ oxbridge, imperial &amp; warwick",

Stem subjects in general require a lot less reading, and experience than non stem subjects regardless of where you study.",

Feel free to DM me and I'll put you in touch with them. I'm sure they would be more than happy to take a call from you.\n\nImperial is no where near as bad as the stories, and instead it's up to you how much you put in. I had friends who would never do problem sheets and skip loads of lectures and scrapped through, and others who stressed way too much but got amazing grades. At the end, no one actually cares what grade you got as a degree from IC is bloody impressive and carries as lot of weight! One issue I had was a couple of random assignments with little direction, but almost everyone seemed to do OK on them.\n\nSocial is quite good at Imperial. There's a massive variety of societies in literally everything, which a lot of unis don't have. Academic ones like rocketry, sports one's, interest one's like sci-fi or cheese. Imperial students are all a bit nerdy, so I fit in very well, but I would also say quite kind people. The union bar is shit, and gender ratio terrible which is a real shame.\n\nBut, you know, you are presumably going to university to learn and not to just have fun.",

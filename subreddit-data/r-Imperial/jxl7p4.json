Unfortunately, the university requires both Canadian diploma and AP, I want to know how many APs are getting an offer. \n\nI have no AP now, but 'm gonna take Calc BC, Physics 1, chemistry, Japanese, physics c mech, and microeconomics in the following AP exam.\n I would like to add more if these are not enough (I already know the concepts for AP, so I hope I can make it...)",

If your teacher predicts grades for qualifications you haven\u2019t taken (A-Levels for example), then they take that into account. \n\nAs per my correspondence with Cambridge before applying this year, APs aren\u2019t a prerequisite, and I can fulfil the requirement after getting an offer. I\u2019m certain it\u2019s the same with Imperial.\n\nYou could just try emailing their admissions office, although I haven\u2019t had luck getting a response myself.",

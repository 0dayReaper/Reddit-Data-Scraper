    "postText": "Hi there,     \n\nI'm a 2nd year natural sciences student currently studying at the University of Cambridge, however I have not enjoyed my time here and having struggled in first year (I got a mid 2.2), subsequently went down a route in 2nd year that I have since regretted, as it has deviated from my true passion (Physics). I have mainly been lacking any real motivation to work, as I have struggled to make friends and adapt to the environment, and so the state of my mental health has not been good. I have only recently fully self-reflected and have been looking into transferring to another uni. Ever since I arrived at Cambridge, I have been wishing that I had accepted my offer for Imperial - London appeals more to me and there seems to be a greater variety of students at Imperial, from lots of different backgrounds - as someone from a mixed ethnic background, I feel like I could relate more to a lot of them.        \n\nWith this in mind, I was wondering if Imperial ever accepts students transferring from other universities? I have read mixed responses online, but it seems like they sometimes do? Is there anyone who has studied (physics, ideally) at both Cambridge and Imperial who could provide an insight into how the two unis/courses are similar or differ from one another? I appreciate that you may see a lot of posts like this, so I do apologise! I'm just in a rather bad spot right now, and any advice is much appreciated.       \n\nThanks in advance!",

I'd feel bad if I didn't warn you to consider that Cambridge and Imperial share a lot of the same student satisfaction problems. It's true you might have an easier time passing exams, but if your reasons for wanting to move are deeper I'd be aware that many Imperial students (and anecdotally physicists) encounter a huge amount of mental health issues.  \n\n\nBut good luck with whatever you decide! Imperial aside, London is a great scene and the clubs&amp;socs are excellent!",

Make it clear you regret some choices and wish to change direction towards physics, and you are thinking of leaving.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re struggling with more than just the course though. Sometimes just discussing our thoughts out loud can help us get more clarity. If you want a neutral place to discuss things then I\u2019d recommend you call nightline.\n\nIts also worth mentioning that the second year of most natsci courses is often the hardest jump in terms of difficulty so I guarantee you\u2019re not going to be alone in finding things hard. Maybe you can discuss with your peers and see what they say. You may also be slightly disappointed by the ethnic and gender diversity in any physics department, frankly, A level applicants are still not very balanced.",

Why not write the email you need to write today?\n\nI studied at Imperial for 9 years in total. I didn\u2019t ever study at Cambridge, but I know a few people who did and, from what I gather, the culture is... different. There is of course still a huge amount of work to be done at Imperial (so be warned!), but I agree that the people and surroundings would probably be, as you allude to, more of what you want you want to spend your time with! London isn\u2019t perfect, but there is absolutely something for everyone here. The shared experience of cultures from all over the world are what make it uniquely special and we are insanely lucky to have it. The universities here are by no means insulated from the city, either. Have you thought about UCL or Kings too? I would consider those if you want to be around arts students as well as science ones. They\u2019re both excellent universities. \n\nOne thing to bear in mind - do you plan to join and retake first year, living in halls? If not, you\u2019re going to have to be proactive in making friends, as it will seem like a lot of people will already have made friendship groups from their halls of residence and course. Don\u2019t let this put you off! I made my best friends in the later years through clubs and societies, and getting out of the uni to do stuff elsewhere in the city. Be a friendly face, do the stuff you enjoy, and you\u2019ll have no problem.",

            "comment": "I studied physics at imperial and then did PhD there. This was over a decade ago so perhaps some things are different, take it with a pinch of salt.\n\nThere were several people in my ug year who transferred from Oxbridge, they all did well and vastly preferred imperial . The big difference then is that imperial physics puts a lot of weight in trying to provide quality lecturers and forces everyone to do experimental labs through the second year. The work load otherwise is similar but I think imperial encourages a little more on student collaboration and profs/ra\u2019s are very willing to discuss if you make the time for it.\n\nI\u2019d consider returning into the 2nd year class as you will still have possibilities to join friendship groups and the course is starting to heat up that year and forms the foundation for yr 3/4. Jumping in at yr3 could be very isolating and frankly I don\u2019t think you will get as much from the course.\n\nLondon is hell of expensive. You will live in nasty digs possibly quite far away.\n\nThe course is hard. People are competitive. London can be as horrible as it is wonderful. I had the best times and the worst times at imperial, it\u2019s totally what you make of it.",

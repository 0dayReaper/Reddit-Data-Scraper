I live in a big single room with view towards S-W and it's the best room ever (I got to choose this room since I am a 2nd year). There are some small single rooms that suck (they are veryyyy small and have a very small window). I still recommend Xenia because the location is just amazing, it's literally in the middle of London and just the location alone is worth having a shitty room, but just keep in mind that if you're unlucky you can get a bad room. If you can afford a bigger room then I'd go for the more expensive one.",

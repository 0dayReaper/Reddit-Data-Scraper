    "postText": "Hello, I graduated with a PhD in mathematical physics a couple of years ago, but never got round to getting a physical copy of my thesis after submission. Does anyone know if it's possible to buy a copy as an alumnus? I know I can obtain an electronic copy for free but I'd really like a physical copy for my bookshelf. I've tried contacting alumni services and the library but no luck so far, any help would be appreciated\n\nEDIT: I contacted the registry and they provided the following information:\n\n\nThe official Imperial format includes the following:\n\nbe covered in purple cloth (e.g. water resistant material)\nHex 800080\nDecimal 128,0,128         \n\nbe lettered in gold up the spine with Degree, Year, and Surname and Initials in the same form as the College records, with letters 16 or 18 point (.25 inch). There does not need to be any information (name, thesis title) on the front cover.\n \nThe Imperial College crest is restricted to a limited number of uses. The crest should not be used to identify Imperial today and cannot be used on materials such as signage, publications, theses, websites,  stationery or presentations. For these materials, you should use the College logo.\n\nThe College recommends eThesis for thesis binding (https://www.ethesis.co.uk/binding/)",

Otherwise it is always possible to go to an external service",

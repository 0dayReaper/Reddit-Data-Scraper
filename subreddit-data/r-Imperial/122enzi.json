    "postText": "Hey everyone. I have to pay the fee deposit for an upcoming MSc course at Imperial but I am still waiting on several scholarship results. If I do not get these scholarships, I will most likely not pursue the degree due to difficulties in financing it. Would I be eligible for a refund on the deposit in this case? Have any of you faced a similar situation and got a refund on your deposit? Thanks in advance!\n\nUpdate: I emailed them regarding my situation and they extended the deposit deadline to after I hear back from scholarships.",

They do have something called 'extreme mitigating circumstances' but unfortunately im not sure if not getting scholarships falls in that.",

If you are a student struggling financially, I\u2019m relatively confident they\u2019ll allow you to postpone the deposit until you are sure you can fund it. They also have the hardship fund which they might allow you to take advantage of, not to mention the student bursary which should help you out whilst you\u2019re here.",

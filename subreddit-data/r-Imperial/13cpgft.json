    "postText": "American student here. I am an IB diploma candidate but also did AP program and State High School diploma. \n\nHas an offer for JMC with conditions IB 42 with Math HL, CS HL, Bio or Physics HL or English HL.\n\nHere is the issue.  As an American student, I believed that I will get Advanced Placement offer which I already meet. 7 AP subjects with 5s and expecting 5s on 3 others. These subjects include Math, Chem, Phys, Bio, English, Econ etc....\n\nI am worried about meeting my offer conditions. Is there anyway that I can request Imperial to change my offer conditions from IB conditions to American AP conditions. If so, what is the best way to do it.\n\nHave an Edinburgh unconditional offer too for the Math+Computing BSc Honors and offers from some good US schools too.\n\nI am considering Imperial but not sure about meeting IB offer conditions. \n\nAny advice ?",

Is the course mainly theory and what are the practicals like?\n\nI have an offer for Physics but am second guessing my choice as I think I'm more suited to EEE. I'd love to hear your opinion!",

I'd love to hear your opinion!\n\nThe course has a lot of practicals (1 lab ,3-4 hrs per week). If you take the advanced electronic option, you get much more lab in term 2. That said, if you prefer EEE, you should go for it. Some people on my course were the same, and they regret not going into EEE instead.",

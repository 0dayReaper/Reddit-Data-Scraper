As for the offer; you are definitely going to need to meet the requirements, but when it comes to near misses they usually look at the student and what they achieved. I, for example, got put in the waiting area for Imperial because my offer was A\\*AAA with an A\\* in maths; however due to the covid algorithm last year I ended up with A\\*A\\*AA: with an A\\* in further maths, but not maths. The woman on the phone was incredibly unhelpful (she basically told me not to get my hopes up and that I probably will be rejected which freaked me tf out) until I sent an email to the department and they replied and sent the unconditional within 2 days. So long as you work hard (and work hard from now until your exams are over), you\u2019ll do just fine. By the way: what are you expecting grade wise? Have you had recents mocks?",

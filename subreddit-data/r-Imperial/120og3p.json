    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am an offer holder for the Mathematics and Finance MSc at Imperial.   \nI noticed that according to their website, MSc courses do not have resits. Is this indeed true?\n\nDoes this mean that the only way to get my degree in the case of failing a course is to wait one whole year to do the course again? In that case, is it needed to pay the tuition fee again for that year (Hoping not lol)?",

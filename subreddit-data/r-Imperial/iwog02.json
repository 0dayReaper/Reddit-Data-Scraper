I was wondering whether my life at imperial would be more stressful than whilst doing the IB. In terms of being stressful, im talking about workloads. How do you compare? Kinda getting nervous a bit...",

Content is definitely very fast paced at imperial but the thing about IB is it was a lot more intense cuz your whole life was about IB and it was more of a \u201cthis determines my whole future\u201d type of thing.",

There's a lot more to study though but if you get your offers worth of IB grades it shouldn't be that overwhelming.",

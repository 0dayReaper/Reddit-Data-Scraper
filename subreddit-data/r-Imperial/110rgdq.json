    "postText": "What are your thought on the MSc programme Applied Biosciences and Biotechnology? \n\nI have completed my BSc at ETH Zurich in Biology and applied for this programme at Imperial. Is it really worth the money and in which ways might it be a better choice to go to ICL instead of ETH? \n\nI am also very interested in biological chemistry. Will the programme cover any topics that require some knowledge in organic / anorganic chemistry? \n\nWhat are the perspectives after graduating from this programme? Do students move on to complete a PHD at Imperial (if yes, will you be paid?) or rather go into industry? \n\nI also need to mention that I am not from the UK and will thus need to pay the international fees and deal with all the visa struggles...\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer me!",

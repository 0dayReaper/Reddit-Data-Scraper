They have very different programmes, so I was wondering if people can share their thoughts on this.\n\nI know it's a bit biased since I'm posting here but I'd like to hear your thoughts.\n\nI'm mainly interested into moving into quant finance after graduation. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I mean I'm obviously biased so bear that in mind: I think Imperial has the superior program for Quant Finance, assuming you want to go into Quant Dev/SWE. The course is very heavy in practical content and by the end of second year you've done a fair bit of concurrency and worked on some large projects, things that are nice to interview with; it's not a surprise that most Quant Devs and SWEs are from Imperial (anecdotally, I was speaking to a GResearch Headhunter who said more than 50% of their devs are from Imperial). By contrast, Oxford has a very theoretical course. That's not to say you can't get similar roles from Oxford (to be honest, with Imperial or Oxford, you're not getting CV screened anywhere), but ultimately the Imperial degree has much more of an industry focus. If you're more keen on the quant research/trading side, I think Oxford may be a better pick. Your exposure to maths and theoretical content is more advantageous to those roles; though again I know of people on my cohort who have certainly interviewed for those roles. Both very, very safe choices and the meritocratic nature of quant recruiting means that whatever you pick, once you're being interviewed it boils down to how you perform on the day.",

And both CS labs of these schools are small and at oxford I've heard there's a large finance research institute that receives quite a decent amount of funding and provides ample machine learning research opportunities. I would go to imperial if i intend to work on industries right after the undergraduate studies. I would go to oxford if i intend to pursue grad school (masters).",

But it depends on where you want to live also. \n\nI hope you will make the good choice!",

If your good enough to get into Oxford then apply to Dyson or JLR it will be better for your programming and development than any degree a top university will give you. If you go with either of the 2 mentioned you will still get a degree from Warwick! \nEDIT: after rereading your question other companies to look and would be PWC or EY for a highly rated degree apprenticeship based around finance",

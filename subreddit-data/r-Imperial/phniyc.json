    "postText": "Hello! I'm an international applicant for the 2021/2022 cycle interested in Applied Mathematics/Mathematical Physics. Can anyone give me advice on how we can take the STEP instead of the MAT as an admissions test? \n\nI've applied to other courses as well, and their admissions exams (NSAA specifically) clashes with the MAT on the same date, same timing. My region does not accomodate for a change in exam timing as well. Would this be a valid reason to take the STEP next year as well? How should I go about doing this? Thanks so much!",

            "comment": "I'm sorry but since I'm a home student I'm not entirely sure how international applications work, but at least for us, if you wanted to take STEP instead of MAT, you would apply for the course after the 15th October deadline for early applications (for Oxbridge, medicine and conservatories and such). \nPeople who send in their application for a Maths course before 15th Oct get MAT offers, and I think people who send in application after 15th Oct get STEP offers (the thinking is that you've missed the deadline for the MAT in Nov so you'd need to take the STEP in June). Hopefully that was helpful, but sorry I couldn't be more specific to international applications.",

    "postText": "Hi\n\nI am an international offer holder. Last week I have uploaded my ATAS and also emailed my acaemic offer conditions to the admission team (as suggested on my offer letter). The imperial gateway shows that ATAS condition is satisfied, but the academic condition entry still shows 'Not Received'. My course starts on November and still I haven't received CAS, nor did I receive the imperial email id. Emailed the admission team twice but no reply. Also my department emailed them, but nothing changed.\n\nAnyone else on the same boat? Should I be worried abouth anything? Thanks for your feedack.",

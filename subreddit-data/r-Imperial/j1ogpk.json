Thank you all of you.\n\nSo basically, I'm a junior who wants to apply to Imperial with the hope that I somehow land an unconditional offer. \n\nI have completed AP Computer Science A and AP Calculus AB (scored 5s on both last year) and I'm currently doing AP Physics 1, AP Computer Science Principles, AP Statistics and AP Calculus BC.\n\nIf I score 5s on all of those (being very optimistic here) can I get an unconditional offer for Computing? I will only be taking AP Physics C next year.\n\nThanks, and have a great day!",

Don't push for 5 or 5 fives, it's just redundant and risks compromising your other exams. Unless you beleave you can do it in which case the more the merrier",

I.e. you must have 5s in all your AP courses that the department wants when you submit your application.  So unless you're getting everything in your penultimate year (i.e. the year before you apply), you're probably getting a conditional offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe good news is if you meet what they want from a conditional offer, you're in!",

    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI recently received an offer from Imperial college for MSc in Control and Optimisation at the department of EEE\n\nWhat are the job prospects for an international student in the UK after graduating?\n\nI also have an offer from UPenn MSE in MechE (Robotics). \n\nI am more inclined towards Imperial due to the short duration of the course and the taught modules which are in line with my interests.\n\nKindly provide insights regarding the job market in the UK and which country is better for industrial placements\n\nThanks!",

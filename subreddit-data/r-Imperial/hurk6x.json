    "postText": "I will be starting my first year at Imperial this autumn and am currently deciding which accommodation I want the option of living in. Currently, I know I will enter Beit, Southside, and Eastside as options. However, I need help choosing between Wilson, Pembridge, and Xenia.  \n\nI'm leaning towards Wilson as a fourth pick, but don't know the relative pro's and con's regarding Xenia and Pembridge. I would like to live as close as possible (hence I am picking from the closest halls to imperial) but also heavily weigh in social life. The quality of the kitchen or bathrooms is not a huge concern of mine. I know ill be opting for ensuite rooms (due to COVID) and don't find the state of the kitchen as important as a good social life or location. Feedback on these halls, your accommodation experience, or opinion on the choice would be helpful :).",

            "comment": "FYI, I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t have to enter 5 different accom locations. You can select both a single and a twin room at each hall, so you could do single/twin Eastside, single/twin Southside, and single Beit. Keep in mind all twin rooms are now the same as premium single rooms. \n\nI haven\u2019t gone through the accom application yet, but that\u2019s the info they have on the site as well as what I\u2019m hearing from some other freshers",

                    "comment": "Woodward is pretty much isolated. If you want to have a social life, that is not the place. The rooms are nice, but then I would pick Kemp Porter since it\u2019s in the same place but newer (might fix Woodward\u2019s crowded spaces). Xenia is good for clubs since it\u2019s in central London, but other than that, pretty average. Pembridge and Wilson are good, located in nice areas with lots of shops and restaurants and is close to university. Most of the social life revolves around university societies, so being close to university to attend society events/weekly meetings is key. The other stuff like finding friends and going out is possible at every accommodation. Having more people living at one hall isn\u2019t going to affect the number of people you\u2019ll make friends with. I lived at Woodward and never got to know the names of 650/700 people that lived there.",

Wilson has smaller kitchens and so less people sharing the kitchen, although it does still get crowded.\n\n I think the smaller sections make it easier to make friends, especially because I get social anxiety when hanging with large groups. I know more people from Wilson than I do people on my floor.\n\nAs for location, it's just on the other side of Hyde Park relative to imperial, and if you're having a later class it's actually possible to walk through the park, although it does take a while (~30 mins). Also the park is closed at night, so you have to take the bus home after a certain time.\n\nI haven't seen a Wilson room so I can't really comment on that.",

Quick questions about Southside:\n\nI understand its the most international and modern, but that the \u2018atmosphere\u2019 was different there. What does that exactly mean? Were people just less willing to go to socials, nights out and hang out? Or were they just more in groups of their own but still did stuff regularly?",

Like when people on my floor went out it would be 15+ people, not including peeps from other floors. I also think they go to clubs, bars more, which isn't my thing so I didn't really click with people on my floor.",

That being said I still had a fantastic time there and made many close friends in halls that are still friends to this day.\nThere were probably about 30 of us across a few floors who used to go clubbing together. You could usually find someone up for going out to do something.",

Im likely to take an ensuite room, so do you have any feedback regarding those at Pembridge? \n\nAlso, was the overall maintenance of the place a problem? Im not very concerned about the kitchen, but I heard about a bit of a mice problem and some flooding? \n\nLastly, how was the social life? Did people at Pembridge mostly go to socials at uni or also go clubbing? (As in it depends on the people but was that a popular option at Pembridge or not?( because of its location)).",

There was no flooding when I was there though I believe there where a number of mouse sightings, though I don't think it was ever a problem. Overall things seemed old but reasonably well maintained. Some people went clubbing, the location is excellent transport wise so its not too hard to get to places.",

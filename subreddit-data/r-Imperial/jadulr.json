I have a ton of super/extra curriculars plus work experiences on my personal statement.\n\nBut with my GCSEs I got 8s in maths science and computer science, and 7s and 6s with the rest (4 in french which sucks) \n\nHow much would this hurt my application?",

However, GCSEs can be used to distinguish between two otherwise identical candidates. So while they may have some effect on your application, you still on paper from what you have said have a good chance.\n\nGood luck with whatever choice you make!",

But the only way to be sure is by contacting admissions and asking - I was rejected from aero myself without interview even though I was predicted above the average required grades and had what i thought was a good personal statement.",

    "postText": "Hi all. I am interested in applying for the Business Analytics program. However I am a bit concerned about my mathematical prowess that might hinder my admission or progress. Could someone who is a student currently answer the following questions:  \n\n\n1. I have studied Linear Algebra &amp; Calculus in udergrad. Would that be enough to excel at Math at Imperial?\n2. Could someone share the names of the books that are being used to taught these modules so that I can have a look and try to gauge my skills:  \na) Maths And Statistics Foundations For Analytics  \nb) Statistics and Econometrics\n\nWould be reallt grateful for the help.",

            "comment": "Hi,\n\nI just completed the MSBA program. If you're not good at math, pick something else. Its for your own good. There's a nice teacher for Maths (dunno who'll you get though), but you need to know your stuff. You will be VERY quickly left behind if you are not  mathematically minded. You MAY get away with it if you have prior experience in software development or programming, but try at your own peril. They will interview (pre-recorded) you quantitatively  as well, so make sure your mental math is on point.  Its the hardest program to get into in the business school.\n\nAnyway if you do want to get ahead make sure you take Python course on your own and learn OOP well.Maths doesnt have a textbook but if you wanna get ahead. Do Khan Academy on Probabilities,  and Stats.Very good for LA. You can skip row echelons though - [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS&amp;E - [https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Econometrics-Modern-Approach-Standalone/dp/130527010X/ref=sr\\_1\\_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1620791413&amp;refinements=p\\_lbr\\_one\\_browse-bin%3AJeffrey+M.+Wooldridge&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Econometrics-Modern-Approach-Standalone/dp/130527010X/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1620791413&amp;refinements=p_lbr_one_browse-bin%3AJeffrey+M.+Wooldridge&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",

I am not bad at Maths but I have to work hard and have scored really good grades before in Maths. Will definitely go through khan academy's videos again. Really grateful for the help.",

    "postText": " \n\nWhen I applied for EIE, I was quite interested in computer hardware and programming. After learning about BJT and MOSFETS in ADC, I absolutely despise it. Moreover, DE is fine but CA is nearly as bad as ADC. Don't get me started on Topics in EE, that's just atrocious. However, I really enjoy the math and programming aspects of this course.\n\nSoon, I'll be moving onto 2nd year, but looking through the modules they don't look very appealing to me. As of now, I basically just want to do programming + math modules. Can anyone give me some insights to the following modules:  \n\\- Communications  \n\\- Control Systems  \n\\- Information Processing  \n\\- Instruction Architectures and Compilers (sounds like an even harder CA module).\n\nRight now, I'm averaging about 65% for ADC, DECA and TEE and about 80% for programming and maths. I know I'll be fine for the last 2, but I really can't understand the contents of the first 3 modules. I am expecting a score of about 45-55% in the final exam and the lab orals went relatively bad, I didn't finish everything and I couldn't answer any questions that were asked about the circuits. I guess my question is, how well do I need to do in my first and second year?",

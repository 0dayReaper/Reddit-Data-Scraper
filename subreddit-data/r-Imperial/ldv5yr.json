    "postText": "Hey! I'm giving the AMAT(Aeronautics Mathematics Admissions Test) for the department of Aeronautics and was wondering what kind of questions are asked on it given it's an MCQ test of 30 minutes. Also, compared to tests such as the MAT and SAT, how does the difficulty compare? Also, is any knowledge of Mechanics(such as SUVAT equations) from physics needed?",

But people on Reddit who claim to have done say it is mainly pure math like calculus, trig and functions, also some mechanics, and that some questions are pretty easy and some are hard. Try searching for other threads about it on the subreddit since they have more info",

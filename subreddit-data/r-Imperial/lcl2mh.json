Sent them 2-3 mails about it over the course of 3 weeks and received no response.\n\nAlso does Imperial need you to send the score through your centre or do they just check using the Test Report Number?\n\nAny help is appreciated, Thank you!",

It doesn't specifically say that you have to do this, but the \"English Language Requirements\" section is under the \"completing your offer conditions\" section. Which means that you send the score after you receive an offer. Also the deadline for this is in July so nothing to worry about rn",

    "postText": "I was an unusual case who never applied to Oxbridge and only applied to four Imperial courses and one safety at UCL. Yes, you can apply to multiple Imperial courses and actually get multiple offers.\n\nIn fact, I held three different unconditional offers from Imperial: EIE, Materials, BME.\n\nAnd who cares about UCL's offer?\n\nI chose EIE.\n\nNow, I will give you an example of my BME interview, which was the most interesting one.\n\nIn the broad picture, Imperial interview requires you to understand the mathematics, physics, and other relevant subjects to your degree almost equivalent to an Oxbridge interview.\n\nWhile getting an interview is more conclusive as an indicator that you will receive a final offer from imperial relative to Oxbridge, \\~30% of candidates still get rejected after the interviews so you should stay frosty.\n\nMy interview began with graph sketchings of weird functions that you do not see often.\n\nThen, the BME prof moved on and asked me to explain what theory of physics does the heartbeat monitor sensor utilises, where my answer was that it uses the theory of discrete absorption/emission spectrum of electromagnetic waves to monitor blood flow(haemoglobin concentration determines the resultant spectrum). It was a miracle that this answer was in fact correct, as I did not have any preliminary knowledge and I just bullshitted about how I would make such sensor.\n\nThen, the prof asked what digital/analogue components are embedded within a simple interactive Christmas card product which he has shown to me.\n\nIt even went further into how ALUs operate, but that was just because I loved to talk about computing in a BME interview (rofl)\n\nAfter my interview, the professor said: \"Welcome to Imperial\".\n\nMy interview was quite belated, so if you are successful after one belated interview, the interviewer would usually give you a verbal offer before an official one.\n\nGood luck to you all, and I hope I see you guys around the campus next year.",

While not ideal, I think this is reasonable enough for students.\n\nIt's just silly to expect a room for less than \u00a3100 a week 5 minutes from college, even if it is 'of low specification'. Besides I'm sure this article was written taking the average price for a single room, not taking into the large cost reduction for shared rooms.",

However the halls in south ken (and even pembridge which is a 20min walk.. a little different to a bike ride or bus) allow the students to adjust to London life a little and enjoy the lighter workload of 1st year in a sociable environment with the other students on their course who might not be in their halls.\n\nThe college has massive buying power is is not really half as skint as they make out. I think they have a responsibility to make the university experience as positive as is possible. Keeping halls close to imperial with low rent is part of that. \n\nUnfortunately though i would say low rent is in the \u00a3120 range; Its what I paid 9 years ago for my room in halls. ",

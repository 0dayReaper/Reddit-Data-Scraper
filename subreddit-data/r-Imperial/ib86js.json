For more specific chats (like course-specific ones) just join the general one and ask if anyone has the invite link. These four are usually full, but many people have left recently because of A level results. \n\n[General Chat #1](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JhlsEMjWL5Y4mju75pAZSD)\n\n[General Chat #2](https://chat.whatsapp.com/HycYs6iO1GBJ4knxuEZ003)\n\n[General Chat #3](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FxRrDhFD1I55JWkUB7R2r7)\n\n[General Engineering Chat ](https://chat.whatsapp.com/J8PjEoq7B4RBh7dnnlmgWi)",

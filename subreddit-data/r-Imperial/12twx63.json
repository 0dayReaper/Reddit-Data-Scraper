            "comment": "Student satisfaction is low across Imperial but due to the online nature of this course, it's hard to find good people. Generally you would meet people after lectures and do something together after but that's not possible with this course. Academic side of things, it's a great course and very useful. You got nearly 400 clubs so if you want to find people outside your course you'll be fine.",

    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm an offer holder from the United States, and was wondering if there were any Discord servers or anything of the sort for American students. I'm super excited by the prospect of going to Imperial and would love to talk to current or graduated Imperial students from North America, but a quick scroll through the list of societies suggests that there isn't a centralized group of Americans at Imperial. If anyone knows of anything, please let me know!",

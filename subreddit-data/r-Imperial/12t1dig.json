    "postText": "I had a question on the admissions page, with the minimum requirements for IB scores. Is this out of 42 or 45? It sounds incredibly hard for some courses like aerospace with a typical offer of 42.\n\nAlso have any IB students taken the STEP exams, or the imperial entrance exam? How different is it from the IB HL maths syllabus?",

Also, the entrance test is actually quite simple. If you are comfortable with IB Math and Physics, and are ok with revising some A-Level Physics topics (for like maybe one or two questions from topics not taught in IB), it's a breeze.",

Even if they do it later, don't worry, they will definitely send you an email at some point early this summer.\n\nYou can find all halls of residence here: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/campus-life/accommodation/halls/ug/. From what I remember you will have to choose 5 types of rooms from different halls and they will randomly give you one of your choices",

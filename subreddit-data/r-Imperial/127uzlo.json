    "postText": "Hey guys, got a conditional offer for JMC recently, and I am a UK citizen but an overseas resident so it is international fees.\n \nI just wanted to learn more about the career prospects out of the course as I saw only it\u2019s 55k which is much lower than I\u2019d thought/heard about the big tech or finance jobs.\n\nI wanted to ask how people are generally doing  from the JMC course, and I\u2019m specifically interested in investment banking/quant roles and also FAANG. What\u2019s the general salary range and how likely is it to get a tier 1 banking job in general?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any help as I\u2019m trying to weigh my options for bachelors/undergrad right now so I\u2019m trying to get a lay of the land in terms of future careers.",

            "comment": "JMC is one of the best options and preparation in the country to get into quant and FAANG, but in the end is about how well you do in the interviews and a bit of luck. Salaries for these roles are way higher than 55k (think some people get into phds or other less paid roles which lower the statistics). Hard to say a specific salary, but if you get into any of these firms you should expect 6 digits rather soon and 7 if you\u2019re good and progress in your career.",

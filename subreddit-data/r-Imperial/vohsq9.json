    "postText": "When people say the workload is high, how high is high? Would it be feasible to treat Uni like a 9-5, 6 days a week and get by? Or would you need to be working a lot more than that? \n\nI\u2019m thinking of applying for computing, I mainly just want enough time to train for powerlifting in the gym 3-4 days a week, socialise for about an hour a day and maybe do stuff with friends one or two days a week for a few hours. I would like to know if that\u2019s possible, while still sleeping 8-9 hours and keeping up with the work.",

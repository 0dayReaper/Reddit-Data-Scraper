    "postText": "Hi, when I was at the EEE / EIE offer holder day, I remember some of the current students mentioning that when buying a laptop, a certain usb port is required when connecting to the lab equipment at the university. It's been a while since then and I've forgotten what usb port they said was required so if there is an EEE / EIE student here who could help, I'd really appreciate it.",

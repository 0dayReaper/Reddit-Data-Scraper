There are some attempts to also livestream them but idk how that is working out.\n\nGroup projects are predominantly in person, though there is no reason you could not coordinate with your teammates online (though that isn't easy).",

After all, who wouldn't want the option of studying digitally, especially in these trying times?\n\nRest assured, many schools and universities are embracing the hybrid/remote learning model that allows students like me to experience the same educational opportunities while still being able to manage a range of commitments such as work and family life. So yes, there is room for flexibility!\n\nWhether you're just starting or planning for postgraduate studies, [hybrid remote learning](https://lanschool.com/distance-and-hybrid-learning-resources/) offers an excellent way to stay connected without compromising your education.",

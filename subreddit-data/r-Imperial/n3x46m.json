    "postText": "Hi, I have an offer for Aeronautical Engineering starting this year, and I have looked into laptops and the M1 MacBook Air seems far superior to any windows laptop in the same price range. Are the programs needed for the course available on MacOS? And if not, would using the department's computers suffice, or would this be too inconvenient? \nThanks",

But there is no doubt being able to do that stuff on your own computer is much much more convenient, you can work on it at home without remoting to their slow servers. Plus most of the aero apps are not ARM optimised yet I think, I'd go for a pc with beefy ram and cpu (for CFD on star-ccm); but as I said, it's not necessary at all, just convenient.",

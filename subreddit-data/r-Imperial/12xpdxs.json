    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI was recently given a conditional offer for the Computing MSc specialized in AI &amp; ML and have to accept by next week. For the past month I've been debating whether or not to accept: for context I'm Italian studying at Bocconi university in Milan. Bocconi has always been a more econ/finance/social sciences focused uni but recently started expanding into STEM, in fact I'll be part of the first group of alumni from their Bachelor in AI. Now they'll be starting an MSc in AI as well which will act as the natural continuation of the bachelor. \n\nThere are a list of pros and cons for each uni, Imperial is way more prestigious in the STEM field and will probably offer amazing networking opportunities. Also being in London is a big plus for me. However it's super expensive due to overseas tuition + cost of living in London. Given that the costs are focused in 1 year, i would have to take out a loan to pay these fees. Also I personally would prefer the course to be 2 years long rather than the 1 year custom in the UK. \n\nOn the other hand, I should be able to waive my tuition fees for Bocconi next year so financially it is the safer choice by far. Bocconi MSc is 2 years long with a mandatory internship and an exchange program, which are all pros imo. Also I've already been in Bocconi 3 years and could get a research assistant position here soon, which I would have to abandon if I left. Social life is also pretty good here. Given that I've also lived in Milan my whole life makes this the easier choice. My main concern would be opportunities after graduating since the job market in Italy is not very appealing to me and Bocconi's connections are mainly with consulting firms/banks/hedge funds etc. (which do not really interest me). Also being the first set of people to undergo the program can be a cause for concern too (there were certainly some issues during the Bachelor because of this reason). I might also be interested in pursuing a PhD and it seems like prestige matters quite a bit during applications for those programs.\n\nSorry for the long post, I probably didnt need to include all these details lol. I just needed to write this stuff out at some point. To conclude I just wanted to ask if anyone here was admitted to the same program (or a similar one) at Imperial and, if you accepted the offer, what was your motivation? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Congrats on your offer. I think this is one of the degrees that should pay off, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about short term money. I did a PhD in ML and I think having Imperial in your CV will help you in getting an offer. Bocconi is a very good uni but it really doesn\u2019t have a reputation outside of Economics/Finance. London is also the best place in Europe for a job in the field, so living here will also enable you to attend networking events, seminars, hackathons, workshops and various events to meet people in the field. I wouldn\u2019t understimate that! Good luck in what you decide.",

Il mio ragionamento \u00e8 stato che indubbiamente andare all'Imperial mi tiene aperte pi\u00f9 porte (in primis se volessi cercare lavoro a Londra). Qualora decidessi di tornare in Italia il vantaggio sarebbe molto pi\u00f9 relativo (seppure presente), visto che gli stipendi sono quello che sono e una laurea in fisica \u00e8 comunque molto rispettata. \nA parte i costi quindi c'\u00e8 solo da guadagnare direi, e per quanto la cifra sia mostruosamente alta alla peggio ci immoliamo all'alta finanza londinese per un annetto e ci rientriamo facilmente. \nFammi sapere cosa decidi di fare!

I have also a offer for a gap year as a research assistant in Deep learing in astronomy. \n\nHonestly, it feels like the 2 years programs are more appealing but the UK universities are more prestigious. \n\nFor you case, maybe to can get more info for the exchange you can have ? From what I\u2019ve seen a good exchange can give you a lot of opportunities too. \n\nWe can discuss more in DM if you want :D Im also open to more info that could help me to chose too haha",

If you remove those, is the course going to be much longer than a year\u2019s worth of content? And if you then condense it a little bit more, and make it a more intense course, is there not going to be a similar level of academic rigour between the two?\n\nAnd I mean, I can see the idea of \u2018two years better than one\u2019, but if a two year masters *was* so much better, surely UK unis wouldn\u2019t have such a good international reputation? Idk, I\u2019m a UK home student so haven\u2019t looked much at international Masters at all, so I could be wrong, but it doesn\u2019t seem like adding an extra year to the course is going to make it much more academically sound to me haha",

Maybe if I had done a MSc it would have made the first 6 months of my PhD easier, but that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m a bit skeptical about taught masters as preparation for PhD. What it would actually help a lot is a research master, MPhil or experience as researcher assistant in a lab, as it\u2019s basically an extra year of research, so many first year mistakes can be done there so you don\u2019t repeat them during the PhD. Advisors also know that and prefer to recruit from them, particularly if you have a published paper. Learning how to read and write academic papers, do basic experiments in your field, learning the background literature, work independently on something ambiguous\u2026 those are the skills needed for a PhD that are not necessarily taught in a MSc (except for the relatively short masters thesis)",

Which is absolutely fine! Italy is an amazing country, and Milan is lovely. But you\u2019ve not *really* listed any serious academic plus-points for your current university.\n\nI\u2019d also say that it is a really good thing to do to study away from where you grew up, and get that expanded range of life experience - especially given you say you grew up in Milan, as well as studying there. Living in a new city will give you a LOT of life experience that you may not gain with the safety net of being in your home city, and that can be as valuable as a lot of the academic benefits as well.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m not too sure why you\u2019d prefer a 2-year masters? If half of your masters in Italy is going to be in placement and/or exchange, then I don\u2019t see the benefit?\n\nYou won\u2019t really have a longer period of education- because you\u2019ll be on exchange or internship for at least half of the course duration I\u2019d imagine? And if you did a one year masters here, you could just\u2026 get an internship in the year after your masters? Or if you have the opportunity, a job? Which would be likely much easier with Imperial\u2019s name behind you. It just seems to open more opportunities.\n\nYes there is financial risk, and as I don\u2019t know your personal finances, I can\u2019t comment on that there. Only you\u2019ll know how able to deal with that expense you are, and I can\u2019t help you there. Plus it would depend a whole lot on things like the terms of the loan you\u2019d have to take, etc\u2026 \n\nBut at the end of the day, all of these things are your decision, and I hope it goes great for you, regardless of what you decide! \ud83d\ude03",

It's kind of surprising actually, a couple of months ago I was convinced that I wanted to go abroad to continue my studies and had zero intention of staying, hence why I applied to foreign unis. Now that it's actually time to choose it's harder than I thought it would be...\n\nObjectively, though, going to Imperial is the better choice for the reasons you've listed as well.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m in year 12 and it\u2019s January so I have about 10 months until I have to start submitting uni application. I\u2019d like to study engineering or natural sciences (probably natural sciences) and I have barely done anything that I can put on my personal statement so far. I\u2019d like to know what my chances could be of getting into top universities (e.g oxbridge) if I work super hard from now on. Is it at least a little normal to be in my position or would almost all people who get into top universities have done wayyy more than me by now? Also, if anyone has any tips on what makes a good science applicant then that would be so greatly appreciated. If anyone who has been accepted to any top university anywhere could tell me what they did to get in that would be amazing too! Thank you\ud83d\ude0a",

But as long as you can convincingly explain why you're interested in the course you don't need to be drowning in supercurriculars. I just talked about a few books I'd read and my astronomy GCSE.\n\nWhat matters a lot more, particularly with Oxford/Cambridge is the admissions test and interview. Start practicing for the tests over the summer.",

A decent A level grade should guarantee you an interview, and answering the questions correctly during the interview should get you in.",

Virtual interview ? \n2) Did I submit my application too late and will it not be considered ? \n\nI would be grateful if y'all take some time to help me out. \n\nThanks \u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I applied to the MSc Advanced Computing last year (and am currently enrolled). To answer your questions, I submitted my application about this time of the year (I can't remember if I did it just before or just after the Christmas break) and got a reply first week of February. So I don't think it's too late, it's on a rolling basis but I don't think they start considering application too early for it to have an impact at this point in the year. Also I didn't have a physical/virtual interview at all, but the process might vary. You can probably find out more on the Department of Computing's website!",

            "comment": "MSc is undergraduate right?  I think the ddl of application is Jan15th and imperial consider all applications (that are submitted before the ddl) equally regarding the time.  That is, u r not too late.  They will send u emails about what to expect next within several days (maybe weeks. I cant remember exactly).  I dont know for computing ai, bur for my programme (EEE) there will be a granted interview as long as u meet the minimum requirement.  All the info is on the imperial website anyway, you will also know if there is an interview by their email.  So just wait for further information and i believe you are alright.  Anyway, wish you good luck with your application and wish me same luck with my application as well :)",

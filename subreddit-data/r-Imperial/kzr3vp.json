(class of \u201821 send help xx) \n\nlots of love if you can answer some of these questions!! i\u2019m honestly so scared and i don\u2019t know what to do .. cries\n\nupdate: i got in!!!",

            "comment": "I went through this last year, haha (current first year chem student at Imperial), so although things might be a bit different this year with them being online (pretty sure they are right?) I hope I can still help on a couple of points!\n\n1. I am pretty certain I got asked that, yeah. BUT it\u2019s an easy question to have a pre-written answer for, and it doesn\u2019t really have to be something groundbreaking - just something simple, concise, that makes sense - perhaps something about being impressed by the research imperial does for the why imperial bit, or something like that, haha\n\n2. Mine was very personal statement heavy. Each of the interviewers (I had two, although that might be different with it being online? Idk) had a small notebook with basically what looked like notes from my personal statement, as well as some questions they\u2019d thought to ask based on it. I don\u2019t think I had any questions that *weren\u2019t* about my personal statement that were academic - I had a couple non-academic ones, like the why imperial and why chemistry, but I *think* everything else was personal statement driven.\n\n3. Now, I\u2019m not too sure for this. When I did it I was in an interview room and a whole wall of the room was a whiteboard, so you stood up and wrote on there. With it being online it\u2019s possible they might use an online whiteboard app, or they might want you to write stuff on paper and hold it up to the camera, not sure. \n\nBut, the academic questions, for me anyway, were basically all theory based, from what I can recall. Discussion type questions, and a few molecule and reaction drawing ones, nothing that would require you to sit and punch numbers into a calculator. Keep one nearby, but it\u2019s not the thing you\u2019re most likely to need, imo at least.\n\n4. I can\u2019t remember too well, but I\u2019d say for my interview at least, it wasn\u2019t quite as binary as that. It was more a directed discussion, I think, where they\u2019d ask a question and build from there with follow ups and what have you. I think they\u2019ll basically ask you stuff as long as there is time in the interview for them to do stuff, although I could be wrong. \n5. I can\u2019t really say. Even if I was to look up the admittance rates from interview, I really doubt they\u2019d apply currently. They can interview far more people if they want to online than in person, although idk if they will, and also with teacher assessed grades a lot more people have got in - we\u2019re about 50 over normal capacity I believe right now. So what I would say is don\u2019t concern yourself with that. Getting in is NOT a percentage chance, they will make you an offer because they like you and they think you will do well here, not because they tossed a coin!\n\n6. As I said before, mine was mostly personal statement driven, so as long as you know the stuff that\u2019s on there pretty well, then you should be good. I\u2019d say know your AS content well, and know the topics *you have been taught* is A2 so far pretty well also. If they ask something not from your personal statement that you don\u2019t know the answer to, just tell them, and say \u2018sorry, we haven\u2019t learned that yet\u2019 or something like that - every school teaches in a different order, some do organic first and some last, whatever, and so they won\u2019t be mad about it!\n\nAnd lastly, I just want to mention to not worry about it too much! I know it\u2019s hard, because it IS super important, but the less you panic the easier you\u2019ll probably find the experience! Also, I feel I should mention that all the staff in chemistry are really helpful and nice people, at least that I\u2019ve met, and they want you to do well also, they\u2019re not trying to \u2018catch you out\u2019 or anything, they just want a chill, informative discussion!\n\nAnyway, I hope that helped, even if it is hard to know how things will pan out with the different system this year! Good luck for your interview!",

Although, with it being A-level ones there\u2019s only the... four? Mechanisms they can ask you about, so you could revise them anyway, if it would make you feel more prepared! Haha. \n\nBut yeah you\u2019re right they\u2019ll be awkward to draw online so I doubt they will ask you to do that, tbh. They *could*, I\u2019d say, but I\u2019d personally say they\u2019re only likely to if your PS ties into mechanisms, haha",

            "comment": "1) YES! have an answer ready to \"why imperial\". It will be asked in one form or another. There's nothing that screams \"don't let me in\" than they ask the question and you just go \"uhhh ...\"\n\n2) I did engineering so I don't know about chemistry but you'll probably be asked to graph something (idk again about sciences but with all the engineering graphing is super common). You may also be asked some chemistry question, the general idea is the question won't be hard but they'll be abstract.\n\n3) they'll give you everything, it can't hurt to bring a pen. Sometimes they may say something like \"bring us some of your work to show us,\" if it's optional do it anyway. Can't hurt. Don't feel bummed if they don't ask for it, so many people bring in work and the interviewer just ignores it.\n\n4) no idea\n\n5) no idea. Most courses generally interview 250% with intention of half the people making it with conditions (such that the ones who don't make the conditions will make the final admissions ~100%). Though that's not random. My personal tutor said that while it seems very rare, there are SO MANY people who just say \"I don't know\" or \"I can't remember\" to all the questions and don't even attempt them. These are auto-denies. So the general rule is even if your speaking gibberish, just say something and that'll improve your chances. \n\n6) you should be very familiar with your subject area if your going to interview for that subject. Again the questions are going to be abstract and not specific, so don't worry about about cramming like for an exam. And they'll help you if there is a detail you can't remember. But be prepared to work, the questions aren't hard but they're not free points.\n\n7) no idea, probably the same though. Have fun! I have no idea if this is important or not important to getting in or not. Normally, they say there is no dress code, but everyone tends to wear dress/ties. So I guess just because it's home maybe wear something nice to either give a good impression or not be \"that guy who didn't dress up\".\n\n\nTldr: whatever you do, NEVER say \"I don't know\" or \"I haven't learned this\" even if what you say is wrong &lt;- this is almost a free pass for your interview.",

I would recommend learning the Arrhenius equation though, as it's a firm favourite of interviewers (I didn't get asked it, but a lot of people apparently did).\n\nThere might be a little bit of memory required - for mine, I was asked to draw the structures of coal, graphite &amp; diamond along with a more abstract physical chemistry question that was to determine the boiling point of a substance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck!",

TM colours is fairly complex in reality and is 2nd, maybe 3rd year stuff.\n\nThinking back to what I was actually asked it wasn't the boiling point. Instead, I was asked to draw the IR spectra for a carboxylic acid; so it had that nice big, broad OH peak, a sharp =O peak and then a load of stuff towards the RHS. Nothing too crazy - an end of paper A-level question, maybe first year as I threw the cm-1 on the x-axis.\n\nFor your mock question, I'd imagine they want you to know that: electrons exist in valence shells around a nucleus; each shell has a different energy; light, when it hits an electron will excite that electron from one shell to another higher-energy shell; that wavelength is absorbed (E=hv); this corresponds to a particular colour for the TM (the opposite colour of the absorbed wavelength) as each shell level is discrete; different metals/compounds have different colours.\n\nBonus marks if you mention something about d-orbitals (it's in the d-block) and perhaps even ligands, but that's above and beyond.\n\nThis is perhaps slightly above A-level knowledge, but try and work through it anyway. And it's been about 5 years (aaaaa) since I've properly done any chemistry, so there's probably a few things wrong with the above answer, I was just giving you a rough example.\n\nIt isn't a viva - that's the fun part of third year - so they're not looking for an exact answer. Instead they're more interested in whether you can analyse a problem and see if you can draw on your current knowledge to come to a valid conclusion.\n\nDon't worry if you can't remember everything or get nervous, most of the lecturers are understanding, and want to help you. Constants, and your periodic table, while useful to 'know' are not at all vital to remember - even in fourth year you get a help sheet with the PT and a couple of pages of constants and equations.\n\nChemistry isn't a memory based subject, and regurgitating facts and figures will only get you do far. Just take a deep breath and think about how you'd approach it. If it turns out to be a dead end, don't be too disheartened - they might understand why you went down that route. \n\nIf there's something you truly haven't studied yet then be open and honest - maybe it's at the end of your curriculum. Think about it first though, give yourself 15 seconds to ponder it and see if there's anything you can try before you say 'i don't know'. They might nudge you along if you're struggling.\n\nChemguide was a great resource for me back in 2012/13 - good for A-level but also let's you go a bit more in depth if you so please. Do recommend it.\n\nAnd if it's any comfort, my mock interview was tougher than my real one - although I was obviously far more nervous when I was sat in the comp chem basement..",

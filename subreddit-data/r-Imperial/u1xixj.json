    "postText": "I want to go for a PhD after an MSci in Physics. But I know that plans can change and lots of students go in with that mindset and end up in, not research. And also a PhD is a big commitment.\n\nI know as a physics student I should do it only if I love the subject, which is in fact why I'm doing it, if job was all I was after I would've gone for engineering.\n\nHow would you say, are the job opportunities for international students after an MSci in one of the natural sciences, specifically Physics and for international students (since they'd need a sponsor). The reason is that my fees is a LOT, like the overall expenses come out to be \u00a3200,000 at least. I wanna know if it's worth it, and how tough it would be to say, go into Finance or Information Technology (the careers where most physics student go - and they pay well) especially for an international student.",

The skills you gain in mathematics, data analysis and programming are quite in demand, and should allow you to easily switch to a career outside academia. I think the main question you need to ask, is whether you need the expensive Imperial degree to get where you want to be? If the job prospects are the only reason, then maybe not, as you can do well in a career as a graduate from almost any university. There are other aspects that might make the degree worth it for you though.",

This also helps one grow, as a person. I also really wanna try my short at getting into MIT study abroad but that probably won't happen haha. But I really want to learn at a rigorous institution among smart people. Unfortunately, my country doesn't have many of those, at least, not for natural sciences.\n\nBut I'm also worried, because things happen. Maybe I'll lose interest in academia. Maybe I'll have financial issues that prevent me from going for a PhD. Or maybe something else. I wanna know if I'll have other options, like something that is fun (programming, applied maths, etc.) and monetarily rewarding as well.",

As an Imperial graduate, you should also be well set for a PhD.\n\nOn a slightly different note though, I would also recommend looking a bit more into the degree from the perspective of student experience. Maybe check reviews and student satisfaction ratings, or talk to current or past students. My overall experience from the degree has been, well, less than great. I don't mean to discourage you from pursuing a degree there at all, it is still overall a good degree from a good uni. Just don't make the same mistake I did and make sure you know what you are signing up for.\n\nUnfortunately things haven't been the same after the pandemic, the department has stopped giving in-person lectures alltogether and we are left paying the same fees for what has become mostly a subscription service to year-old lecture recordings.\n\nAnyway, best of luck to you on your physics journey!",

I'm also hoping to get into University of Manchester because I love how I can do a BSc in Mathematics and physics and it's so much cheaper, but I suppose it doesn't have as high reputation as Imperial. Also hoping for a scholarship at UCL, but let's see.\n\nBtw about these lecture recordings, are they still doing that in 2022, when the regulations are getting more relaxed? Because that seems like a bad thing! How do you interact with professors and other students?Also I did notice a low student satisfaction on the page, is it due to the pandemic only or are there some other reasons? (I've heard that a significant portion of the faculty aren't good \"teachers\" but good researchers (also they had low \"staff were good at explaining things\" score, but since Imperial students are so smart, they just manage it anyways but I'm not so sure about that.\n\nIt's all so scary.",

Lectures will likely continue as remote for the forseeable future. They say this is because of \"the benefits of online lectures\", but I suspect money has also something to do with it, as they can now probably increase the student intake.\n\nThe student satisfaction was low already before the pandemic. I wouldn't say it's because of poor teaching though, as most lecturers are very good. What's bad is fairness and quality of assessment, quality of feedback you get, and how they handle (or rather, don't) problems when they arise.\n\nAlso, I would say that at least here in the UK, Manchester is also a fairly reputable uni :) We like to hate on UCL, but that's also a good uni and especially if you get a scholarship!",

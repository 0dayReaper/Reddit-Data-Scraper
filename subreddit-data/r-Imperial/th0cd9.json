    "postText": "hi everyone, i'm an international student thinking of coming to Imperial! i applied to biomedical engineering but i was offered a place in molecular bioengineering instead. i have some questions about studying at Imperial, but i also have some doubts about my course in particular. if you know anyone in molecular bioengineering or biomedical engineering, please help me, thank you so much!\n\n1) how is it like studying at Imperial in general, in terms of the culture and learning environment?\n\n2) teaching quality: are most professors good teachers? do they generally put effort into classes, or are they typically more focused on their own research? \n\n3) administrative support: are courses at Imperial well organised and timetabled, and is there fast and adequate administrative support? also are new courses more poorly organised/have less support available?\n\n4) specific to biomedical engineering and molecular bioengineering, what is the difference really? i have seen the list of modules but it seems to be more different than i expected, the course webpage has a short description but i don't really understand it. also, what is day-to-day life like as an engineering student? \n\n5) recognition of a new course(?): molecular bioengineering is a new course with its first batch graduating last year, do you think it will be as widely recognised as other degrees from Imperial or will it be overlooked compared to more well-known or traditional courses?\n\nthank you all so much for your help :)) hope to see you this year!",

Engineering Practice Group meeting tomorrow afternoon and have to work with my Flight Dynamics Lab group on the whole Sunday to finish up everything\n2. Yes, they are. I have a handful of brilliant lecturers this year. They are happy to talk to you and give you supports. I benefit a lot from office hours as well.\n3. You are always busy anyway.",

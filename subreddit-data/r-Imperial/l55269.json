I applied on the 22nd of December and got my acknowledgment email on the 6th of January. \n\n2- No, it doesn\u2019t ruin your chances. When you submit has nothing to do with whether or not you got an offer. \n\n3- I\u2019m not sure about chemical engineering, check their website, you\u2019ll probably find an answer there.",

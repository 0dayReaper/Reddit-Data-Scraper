            "comment": "I think this depends heavily on the bank, so you should look up the surcharge rates for the bank that you use.\n\nIn general, from my personal experience, international payments made using a debit card places a surcharge fee proportional to the original payment (e.g. 5%), whereas a bank transfer places a fixed one time fee charge (e.g. $30 per transfer). For expensive things, I usually pay using online transfer if that is an option (e.g. initial rent and deposit for housing).",

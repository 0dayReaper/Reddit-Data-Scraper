The transition would appear quite stressful as it seems that there's just an unending list of thigs to do. But it does get easier once you figure out you own pace of doing things and as long as you manage at the end no one will bat an eye. Trust me, everyone is as stressed as you are and it will turn out alright at the end.",

However, in a sea of overambition people fail to see how toxic and just plain horrible this is. Everyone is stressed? There must be something wrong with the degree then? But no, I am writing this as a final year Computing and this course is just as stressful (would have said 'more' but it's not a competition). And it's true we're all in this together, but the real problem that is not addressed is that \\*every\\* student at Imperial being stressed is \\*Imperial's\\* fault and problem. And they have never fixed this.",

For that no need to worry.\n\nWhat you should consider is that you will need amazing time organisational skills (maybe not so in first year but from second year onwards) if you want to have a nice/classical university experience, e.g. hanging out, partying and so on. Otherwise, if you let yourself fall behind, you can say goodbye to any social life opportunity because you will be in a constant cycle of chasing deadlines and catching up. Enjoy your first year but also don't let it fool you about the workload that will come after.",

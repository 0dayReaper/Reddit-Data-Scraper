    "postText": "Hey Guys,\n\nI was hoping to connect a group of Imperial College students who play pokemon TCG &amp; VGC both competitively and casually together. There doesn't seem to be a society for it so I was just seeing if there is anyone out there who would be willing to join a group of novice and advanced players of pokemon. If time and people allow, I would possibly host a small mini tournament.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDM me or comment if anyone is interested and a group may form depending on numbers.",

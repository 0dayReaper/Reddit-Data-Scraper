    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nHope you all are well. I have some questions specifically about the MEng Design Engineering undergraduate course at Imperial. I would like to become a student of this course as I simply love both the university of Imperial College London and the modules this course offers - the location in London, a world-class reputation for engineering, a very interesting course structure and much more. If any prospective students of this course, or any students currently studying this course see this post, could you possibly reply or send me a private message. I would greatly appreciate your help.\n\nThank you in advance and have a good day!",

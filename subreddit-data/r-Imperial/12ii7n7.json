    "postText": "Hello,\n\nUnfortunately, I did not received an offer for the Msc in Advanced Computing and so my application has been forwarded to my second choice which is the Msc in Computing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning).\n\nMy worry is that since it is kinda late I feel like my chance of getting an offer is close to none. What do you think about that ? Is anyone is or has been in the same situation as me ?",

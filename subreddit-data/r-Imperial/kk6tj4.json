    "postText": "I recently got an email from Imperial admissions asking me to do a 45-minute math exam as a part of my civil engineering application. However, I couldn't find any material on the test and I'm worried that I will get a nasty surprise.  \n\nCould anyone who has taken this exam tell me what I should expect? Do I need to do complex calculus by hand? And are the questions based on pure math (i.e integrate xsinx/5tanx) or is it application-based questions? \n\nLastly, because my math course allows a formula sheet (IB math AI HL), I haven't memorized many (if any) formulas, should I be concerned about this? If yes, what formulas should I memorize?",

            "comment": "Hey there, good to see another civil eng applicant. I was asked to do this last month and tbh it wasnt half as bad as i expected it to be. I, like you, also expected complex stuff like integrate ln(lnx) or stuff like that but then the test i did was actually decent. The questions would be like the extension questions we get at the end of each exercise from the textbook. They are contextual, so its not like a straight up find the derivative of so and so - the question is based off of a situation. U dont need tl revise, but i guess you could just skim through the textbook to make sure u know how to do the working out and each stage of a particular method. Dont stress too much, u will do absolutely fine.",

Keep in mind that physics is a important part of civil.",

You have minimal time (1 minute max, as little as 15 secs) to think, so choose an answer and plan it - better than spend all your time deciding. Nothing much you can do to prepare.",

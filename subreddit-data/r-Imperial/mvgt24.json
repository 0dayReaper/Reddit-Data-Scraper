I currently hold offers from the MPH programs at Imperial and LSHTM and am so stuck on which might be better for future job opportunities. Does anyone have any opinions on which program might have an upper hand?",

I am hoping to go into epidemiology which both schools offer courses in although I think Imperial has more opportunities with internships and specific streams there. However, the issue arises with LSHTM being better ranked/globally recognized (or so I've read)  so it might be better for networking/getting started in that field.",

I could be wrong about your field, but in general I'm pretty sure Imperial College has far more international recognition than LHSTM if that matters to you- however as I don't know your country of origin I could also be wrong about that too! \n\nAlso research the campuses and areas and think about which might suit you better in terms of location!",

I know many such people who trained at Imperial and Imperial has a lot of history as well. I didn\u2019t apply because I have heard they are very quant focused. Their Epi department is very good. Try and see some alumni on Linked and see where they are at. Which MPH in Lshtm do you have an offer for ?",

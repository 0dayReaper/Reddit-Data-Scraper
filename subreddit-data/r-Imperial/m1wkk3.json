I'm super nervous as I feel like I was a bit slow with the problem that I was asked to solve and I'm super scared of what;s gonna happen now :( We had a really nice conversation about aeronautics and imperial for 20 minutes and on the last 5 I was asked a problem and it was really quick and I'm scared I was too slow :( I've had my interview on Friday btw\nUPDATE: I got in :) Received my offer 18 days after the interview.",

    "postText": "I am a US citizen who has been admitted to Imperial and a very reputable college in the US, both for engineering. If, ultimately, I were to work in Europe, would a degree from Imperial help me in that manner? Is Imperial well recognized by European companies and would it be difficult as a non-EU citizen to get a job in Europe after graduating from the UK? And would Imperial\u2019s connections with the industry be any better than the US, necessarily?",

It is a top 10 university in the world for a reason.\n\nThat said, if you do plan to stay in the USA for work then (assuming cost is equal) USA uni works well.\n\nI did my undergrad in the Northeast USA, doing my master's here while working: the USA degree got me far but even not having finished my master's degree yet having Imperial on my resume has already started to open certain doors",

But generally Imperial is very well regarded here in the UK- and from friends/alumni who've spread across Europe, I'd say it's pretty well respected there too.\n\nI don't believe you'd have any more difficulties getting a job in Europe as a US citizen whether your degree is from Imperial vs a US uni, so I don't think that would be a factor.\n\nGood luck whichever choice you make!",

About the job, the hard part might be to get a visa sponsor as it\u2019s not super common in EU countries to do so but not unheard of, that\u2019s independent from Imperial. Connections with industry are very good. Potentially the best route imo would be to work for a company that has both UK and EU branches and start in UK and then ask to move to EU. Hard to say more without knowing the specifics. Good luck!",

Makes sense about the visa sponsor\u2026 And I appreciate your idea of working for a company with UK and EU branches and transferring later on. In that regard, wouldn\u2019t working at a US company and transferring to their EU office, for example, be another option? I\u2019m currently deciding between Civil Eng at Imperial and Systems Engineering at UIUC (Uni of illinois, very reputable US college consistently ranking top 10 for engineering). With this in mind, do you believe that the UK Imperial degree would have a better chance at eventually landing me a job in Europe over a degree from the US?",

Of course the very big ones are exceptions, but being civil engineering I believe several EU infrastructure companies operate in the UK. But it isn\u2019t my field so take that with a pinch of salt. About uni brand I think Imperial one is stronger than UIUC\u2019s worlwide except in the Americas, but again I might be biased.",

So I think this just boils down to where you wanna work, if you really do wanna work in EU imperial would be strictly better imo.",

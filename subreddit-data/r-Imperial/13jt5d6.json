Is this deliberate or are the mathematical prerequisites taken care of within the course itself? Would I still graduate with sufficient mathematical rigor? \n\nThank you!",

The answer that the head of the department gave was \u2018I have been here for a long time and not once have I heard a physics student complain about a lack of maths in this course.\u2019\n\nThere are also dedicated Maths modules that you can take in year 1 and year 2. Analysis in year 1 and Mathematical Methods in year 2. In year 3/4 if you want you can also take a module from the maths department.",

First year provides you with most of the mathematical tools you'll need.",

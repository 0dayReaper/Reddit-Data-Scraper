Are u looking to read books and find supercurriculars that will later look good on your statement, or have you already done some and are asking which ones to mention? \n\nIn both cases a very solid option is maths - Complex numbers and Calculus are great things to already have in your bag before starting a EE course. \n\nAnyway if you go into a bit more details as to what exactly you need, I\u2019d be very happy to give u some more specific examples/tips.",

            "comment": "The three subjects at highschool that may help is comp sci, physics and maths. For comp sci basic knowledge on trees and pointers would be very nice, on physics expand your knowledge on basic circuits, on maths you could look into more advanced calc, including solving ODEs.\n\nAll this won\u2019t fit into a personal statement nicely though, so if I were to choose one, expand your knowledge in circuits. Talk about something like nodal analysis: it\u2019s something you haven\u2019t learnt at school, but very easy to pick up and will show great knowledge.",

Try to come up with a simple way to solve a common problem, then in the interview(or even ps depending on how many characters you have available) you can talk about the process that went into making it and what unexpected problems you found while making the project and how you found a solution for every problem that came up.",

As far as I know, doing things related to Calculus, Imaginary Numbers as said in the below comment is always good for the theoretical side, I did a supercurricular project relating to the Riemann Hypothesis myself at school, things relating to programming, computer science or anything circuity/physics-y always helps, it's a broad course and thus there's a lot of scope for interest, I would be happy to help if you need any specific advice in PMs.",

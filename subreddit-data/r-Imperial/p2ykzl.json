I wouldn't worry too much about lacking knowledge, because you're going to lack a lot of knowledge later on and work even harder to catch up/fill in those gaps in the future.",

But for us we had welcome events in the department but we also had a Maths refresher exam to examine our Maths competency. For some departments they may ask for a similar exam, in EEE the only effects of sitting the exam were if you passed it and did sufficiently well you did not have to get any 1 to 1 maths tutors for the 1st year, and if you got below a certain threshold you had to go to maths tutor sessions, this might sound bad at first; however I do know people that did get the tuition and it can actually be to one's advantage to have that extra practice, because Imperial's first year of Maths is rather 0-100 in most departments and many who didn't have the tuition aren't necessarily as prepared for it, so it is really a win/win either way. Other than that the actual content of the course didn't begin until after the first week was done, and it was mostly doing fun activities with dept and dorm until that, but make sure you're refreshed on the basics.",

    "postText": "Reasons Why Imperial College London Lacks Diversity\n\nRecent events have made me and many people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) community reflect on our experiences with racial inequality and injustice in our everyday lives, which goes unchallenged.\n\nIn response to the murder of George Floyd, President Alice Gast of Imperial College London declared, \u201cracism and violence have no place in society (and that) Black Lives Matter\u201d. This is a College that was founded to promote \u201cthe commercial, industrial and educational interests of the British Empire\u201d and whose motto \u2018Scientia imperii decus et tutamen\u2019 \u2013\u2018The crowning glory and the safeguard of the Empire\u2019! The latter was only recently dropped from the crest (a hasty gesture that could be construed as performative tokenistic one) against the backdrop of demonstrators dumping the monument of Colston into Bristol Harbour.\n\nSome will say the past doesn\u2019t reflect the College in its present state, and that most of our respected institutions have a questionable genesis. However, the current state shows that racism is alive and well at the College, and this is the experience of many students and staff members. The most striking observation was the hiring practice I witnessed at the College. During my time there, I saw many candidates from BAME background walk past me in the office to interview rooms fully aware of the futile nature of the exercise as the successful candidate had already been selected before the interviews had taken place because he was a friend of x or y. I have witnessed a white colleague confidently describe how he got his job; he mentioned how he was coached prior to the interview by the hiring manager. Fake Job Interviews are not only detrimental to our ethics as a society, but are in fact a dis-service to the College which misses the opportunity to employ a diverse workforce who increase its productivity, creativity, and competitive edge. If those in charge of hiring only hire from their social circle which is exclusively white, then what chance does, for example, a Muslim woman or Black man, or anyone from an under-privileged background, have if they aren\u2019t part of the privileged circle to begin with? This hiring practice perpetuates racism and is reflected in the demographic of the College.\n\nI further witnessed white colleagues dismiss a Black female co-worker as confrontational and difficult for having an opinion thus further compounding existing racial stereotypes of the \u201cangry black woman\u201d. Another Black colleague shared his disgust for being asked if he had any weed at a social gathering because of course, all black men smoke weed!\n\nAnother incident that struck me was overhearing in the staff kitchen a white lecturer angrily question the College\u2019s outreach programme aimed at BAME students; she questioned why white students from working class backgrounds weren\u2019t being targeted. If a lecturer can\u2019t understand that [BAME students are underrepresented](https://bbstem.co.uk/about-us/) in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in the UK, and hence the effort to widen participation and inspire academically talented BAME pupils to pursue STEM subjects, then how will she genuinely motivate these students once they are at the College.\n\nA Black Professor recently shared on social media via #BlackInTheIvory his experience in the College caf\u00e9, where he was asked if he had come to fix the noisy air conditioning unit, or another where he was mistaken for a PhD student and was asked \u201cto wait in a small side room because the PhD examiner wasn't there yet\" when in fact he was the PhD examiner! These examples amplify society\u2019s expectation of Black people, the notion that a Black man can be a Professor in a STEM University is so far fetched that he\u2019s more likely to be an air conditioning repairman than a researcher and lecturer at Imperial College.\n\nImperial College has a racist legacy but it doesn\u2019t have to have a racist future. As we emerge from this pandemic, the College should ask itself what sort of community does it want to be. Changing the name or updating the crest to no longer include the motto is purely a reactionary and superficial gesture. It does not constitute a genuine stand against racism, and will remain an empty gesture without concrete measures to address the  inequality and treatment of BAME staff and students.",

Please do not be scared, I mean no harm.\n\n1)I used quotation marks for diversity not because I do not believe in diversity as a concept. In fact,I think diversity is an very important thing that should be encouraged. The reason I used quotation marks is because I truly believe that diversity is not the thing being sought here. When black-allies email a UCLA university professor and demand easier final exams for black students, it is not diversity nor equality they crave. It is clearly racist inequality that favours black students simply due to the colour of their skin, something I disagree with on principle.\n\n2)It has 'gone out of hand' according to me and my sensibilities.\n\n3)I don't really have an opinion on this, although I do have to say that when one is simply talking about diversity, international students obviously have to be factored in! \nIf the argument was about racial EQUALITY instead, I grant you that international students can be neglected as the main point in that discussion would be the representation of British students.\n\n4)'Overrepresents' how? I do not mean to say that there should be LESS asian/black students in Imperial! All I meant to say is that when one compares the percentage of Asian students in Imperial with the percentage of Asian people living in Britain, one will find a huge discrepancy. Again, I am not saying this is a BAD thing in any way, I am simply stating the facts.\n\n5)The reason I said \"dont quote me on the second one\" is because quite clearly, I wasn't able to look at the statistics at the time when I made that comment. You are indeed probably correct on this point, and I will retract my statement. The hostility is unwarranted though.\n\n\nFinally, let me explain what I actually think, as I believe the comment above did not fully express my views. The main thing I believe in, most of all, is meritocracy. I detest people that use their higher social status or wealth in order to skip ahead in life, and I believe merit MUST be the absolute factor determining university admissions and examinations. This is why I am against policies like affirmative action in the US, and why I am wary of the sudden \"anti-racist\" shift that has happened everywhere in the world. Do not get me wrong- I believe that black students, especially in the US, have -on average- less opportunities to showcase their merit, and that they are disproportionally disadvantaged in life. However, helping them selectively based on the colour of their skin is by DEFINITION racist. That is why I support assistance programs for all poor students, irrespective of the colour of their skin or their ethnicity. I wholeheartedly believe in equality of opportunity, but not equality of outcome, which is what affirmative action and many \"anti-racist\" other policies in the west seem to support.\n\nP.S. : The reason I used quotation marks around \"anti-racist\", is because I truly believe that most modern anti-racist views being spouted are in fact racist, just in the opposite direction.",

Currently, the lack of blackness at top universities is in itself a reason why black people continue to apply in a reduced proportion compared to white students. Fewer black people at college leads to a hostile environment where microaggressions are more common. By giving black students advantages to succeed, the objective is to improve the college culture as well as enabling the specific people who receive the advantages.  Although the advantages given (like bursaries) are not themselves necessarily meritocratic, the system they will produce at college will be more meritocratic by creating a safer environment once black people are better represented at college. The meritocratic system will extend far into the future, benefitting all people equally at the expense of a short-term lapse in the principles of absolute meritocracy here and now.  \n\n\nNote that the college is already very generous towards disadvantaged students of all races. I myself am white and benefit from the means-tested undergraduate bursary which enables me to participle in university life.",

That does not change the fact that all of what you proposed is sugar coated affirmative RACISM. Will lowering the bar of entry for minorities help increase the number of such students and in the long run, create a more meritocratic system? Perhaps it will. However, I do not support such a policy, as it is RACIST. I am against positive or negative discrimination based on someones skin colour, and let me be clear here: the number of students there that shared my skin colour played absolutely NO role in my decision to apply to imperial. I do understand that for some people, it might actually play a role. However, these people, by thinking that way, are perpetuating RACISM. \n\nYou mention that the advantages given to minorities are \"not necessarily meritocratic\". I agree completely, as they are not meritocratic at ALL. They are, in fact, the complete opposite!\n\nTo sum things up: The goal of \"increasing blackness\" is one I find utterly misguided, as it is inherently racist. From what I see on the statistics, unlike my first comment, it seems that imperial has a very good and fair representation of black people compared to the wider british society, unlike most american universities. Finally, I have no issues with scholarships and bursaries that are clearly financial in nature. What I have an issue with is racial quotas, bias in examinations and general academic advantages based on ones race, something that Imperial abstains from, rightly.\n\n The crux is my argument is this: saying that Imperial has a \"diversity problem\" is a very misguided notion.  Backing up that assertion with unproven (and unprovable) claims about \"microaggressions\" is something I also find misguided, as I, as a foreign student, have never seen anything like that take place, nor talked to any other foreign student that truly felt they had been \"microaggressed\" against by any member of staff. Is that a fallacious argument based on personal experience? It might be, but for me, it at least proves that such microaggressions, should they exist, be relatively confined in very few sectors. Finally, I think that endlessly repeating the mantra that all non-white students are constantly discriminated against is very damaging, as it is an inherently non-meritocratic idea. Perhaps you are correct and meritocracy might indeed need to be temporarily sacrificed in order for it to extend into the future. However, by promoting non-meritocratic ideas in the here and now, you are doing the exact opposite by creating and promoting a non-meritocratic system, one inherently based on racism, in fact! Is this not damaging to society as a whole? I am making this argument of consequences, having considered the fruits of such a labour, that are clearly visible in US universities. How is demanding an easier test for black students something that will boost meritocracy in the long run? How is lowering the bar for admissions of black students so much that you get sued for it helping society? Those are my questions for you.",

Individually you are right, it's not just to offer black students bursaries and not white students. But all of the reasons that Black students are underrepresented at top uni's is not their fault, it is the result of centuries of injustice. British society has pushed black people down the social ladder by over and covert means, meaning (as is well documented) that black people are less wealthy and suffer discrimination within the education system. If we now say 'access to education is 100% meritocratic', what is really said is 'access to education will be biased towards those who for historical reasons hold societal and economic privilege' - i.e. disproportionately white students. If a black student has a lower chance to access higher education by virtue of being born to a family that society has sidelined into the working class, that is injustice, and it is a manifestation of historical racism in the 21st century. \n\nI don't think anyone here has said that they think that quotas or examination advantage is a good idea. I don't have many ideas for solutions on this topic, although I think measures to reduce the financial burden of education for black students (like through bursaries) are a good approach. \n\nOn your final paragraph, I think you're mistaken about a few things. If you don't think that microaggressions take place and are genuinely harmful, I suggest you talk to black individuals around campus. Racism at Imperial is better discovered by talking to people who experience it than trying to measure through statistics - I appreciate that we're all scientists, but you'll find it much easier to understand if you engage with the people who experience it. I agree with you that's it's wrong to blanket say that all POC experience microaggressions, this is clearly untrue or impossible to prove.  \n\nOne final point - giving financial assistance to black students is not a 'racist' policy, even if it is racially specific. Racism is not merely differentiating based on race, there are also components of malice and power. \n\nThanks for your detailed reply. Perhaps we could have a conversation about this in the union bar over a pint, if everything gets back to normal.",

Same with the motto/building names/statues etc - it's just white people thinking of gestures to make themselves feel better.",

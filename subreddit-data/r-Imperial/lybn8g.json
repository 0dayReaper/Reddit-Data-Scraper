    "postText": "Hi guys, kind of early birds I know, but I\u2019m currently a second year student on placement, and I\u2019m looking for applying to this course next year. Just because I have an \u2018unusual\u2019 background compared to other people applying, I would like to get some information about getting into this course. For the people that got in, what\u2019s your undergrad background? Did you have to do any interviews? How are you finding the course?\n\nAbout my background, I\u2019m a computer systems engineering (mix between EEE and CS) student at bath, I have a fairly high average so far and I\u2019m currently doing a placement as a data scientist. As I\u2019m not coming from a full CS background, any advice on what gaps should I fill would be nice!",

Your background looks perfectly relevant to the MSc, just make sure you graduate with first class. Also, being a new MSc, any new modules are likely to change slightly over the next 1 or 2 years as things settle. Good luck!",

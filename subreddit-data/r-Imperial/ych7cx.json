    "postText": "So I am kind of in a dilemma between switching between EEE and MechE as I have noticed that overall I think I would enjoy the MechE course a lot more than EEE due to the \"Mechatronics\" side of it.\n\nI am just worried if it is possible and what repercussions it will have now that I have already sent my form and I am about to do an Admissions test sometime next month.\n\nMy personal statement covers both electrical and mechanical engineering but mainly robotics as a core topic. However, it does tend to lean slightly towards EEE.\n\nI am really just worried and would appreciate any help and advice.",

            "comment": "If you contact the admissions office about it, they might let you swap your application from EE to ME. If they don't, then my only advice is to make sure you don't talk about wanting to switch to Mech Eng in your EE interview, because they certainly won't be impressed by a student who still isn't sure if they want to do the course they're interviewing for.\n\nIf you get an EE offer, then it's worth asking to switch again, and if they still decline, then wait until the UK results day comes (a few weeks before university starts), because then they'll have a solid idea of how many spare places there are on each course.\n\nThough if it's purely the mechatronics side of Mech Eng. attracting you, then I would probably say that EEE is a better fit for you anyway, (though I'm obviously biased). All of the good bits of Mechatronics (imo) are the coding, and the control logic, which are firmly in the domain of EEE. They don't formally teach CAD, which might be one of your concerns, but I knew loads of people who self-taught in EEE - it's really not that difficult to learn if you enjoy it. Also, we have the robotics lab and robotics society in the EE building.",

In first year, it's the EERover (wireless car built from motors and an arduino that can scan for different signals), in second year it's not prescribed - you just identify a problem and build a solution for it.\n\nIn third and fourth year it comes down to your choice of modules and final year project, but the most relevant modules would be [robotic manipulation](https://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60030&amp;s=T3#start) and [human centred robotics](https://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC70015&amp;s=T4#start). You can also do the multi-disciplinary project as an I-Explore module, but I don't know much about that. Another great design and build module would be [embedded systems](https://intranet.ee.ic.ac.uk/electricalengineering/eecourses_t4/course_content.asp?c=ELEC60013&amp;s=T3#start), but that doesn't have a robotics / mechatronics focus.\n\nThere's also a Boston Dynamics Spot robot on the 10th floor that someone used in their thesis project this year. The guy had to self-propose the project but that's not too difficult anyway.",

I think I will definitely go with EEE.\n\nAlso, sorry for so many questions but what is the maths like at Imperial and just for EEE in general? Like what topics from A level does it focus on the greatest?",

The robotics projects in EEE therefore usually go far beyond basic manipulation, and will instead revolve more advanced topics like computer vision, AI, and clever control algorithms.\n\nEither way though, if you're keen about doing robotics both subjects offer an easy path into it. It's probably more important to consider all of the other topics you'll have to cover in first and second year.",

You have to make about 4 or 5 different sensor circuits that you then integrate into the Arduino along with code for controlling the motors, which you'll then integrate with a phone or web-app for driving the rover and processing the sensor data. \n\nI believe there's also a second year control lab that involves writing control algorithms for a drone, but in that case you'll be provided with the drone beforehand. \n\nSimilarly for the robotic manipulation module you'll be given a functional robotic arm that you then have to program to do something useful. \n\nThere are also fourth year modules that use drones once you've got a working control algorithm.\n\nIt's the time constraints that really matter, along with the general nature of university education.\nThey're not going to just get you to build a drone using off the shelf components, instead they'll have you do a 10 week predictive control course during which you'll write a control algorithm that enables a drone to fly around a room without crashing.\n\nThis is also a reality of modern robotics, where the majority of the work revolves around writing code etc. that makes all of the mechanical elements work together, on top of adding additional functionality through AI, machine learning, etc.",

    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in the final year of my undergrad, considering doing the 1-year MRes at Imperial. I plan to do an PhD in Neuroscience/Psych eventually (likely applying for Fall 2022 Entry). I am now wondering if I should do a 1 year MRes or instead spend the year doing research internships/ working as a research assistant. So if there are any current/ past MRes students here, I would love to hear your thoughts! Some specific questions I had:\n\n1. How long is the MRes project? Does it start in Sept or later\n2. Did the MRes project/ degree significantly add value to your PhD applications?\n3. What is the schedule like during the semester? Any chances I will have time to intern/ work part-time?",

            "comment": "I'm not a neuroscience person but I was in the Biosciences at Imperial and did an MRes which massively improved me as a person.\n\nThe first thing to do is to get an idea of how \"hands on\" the MRes is by looking at the structure online, and compare it to other MRes courses in your subject area. This is because an MRes is actually a really poorly defined course - some universities have MRes courses that are 80% research based where you gain essential practical skills, whereas others are as low as 20%, so because of this massive range you should get an idea of what the MRes at Imperial for Neuroscience looks like.\n\nFor whether it's worth it, I will emphatically say yes, as long as it is heavily weighted in time doing hands-on research. For my course, we did 2x 5 month research projects which is exactly what I wanted - in science it's more about your practical experience than grades. If you've done research using a particular method/technique that is crucial to the research being done in the PhD/job you're applying for, that greatly outweighs good grades. If you have nearly a years experience of working in a research lab too, you're ahead of most other students, from my experience. So I'd say it's worth it if it's an MRes that is heavily research focused and has very little assessment in the form of exams.\n\nMy MRes gave me the skills I needed to know my subject field really well, on a practical level. It really helped me to answer questions in a realistic way at interviews and gave me a really good portfolio of experience to put on my CV. Ultimately the CV that is best is the one with direct research on it, so anything that expands on that skillet is a winner. This is why volunteering is so useful, but also an MRes is a guaranteed period of time in a lab where you really get to grind out some research that is your personal responsibility, so it hammers the fundamentals into you much more than say a couple of months volunteering, or an undergraduate final year project where you perhaps get more supervision .\n\nSo in short, have a look at the structure, get a rough idea of the time spent in practical settings and choose the MRes that will most amplify your practical skills, if you want an experience that will predispose you to entering research afterwards.\n\nAs a brief post note, I tried to get a PhD for a year and a half with no success after leaving my MSc from another uni, but I didn't have any of the relevant skills. I worked, did my MRes and ended up turning down PhDs after. It was mostly the gain in practical skills that led to this change, but also I think it helps you to be more confident in your abilities if you've been in a proper intensive research environment, so interviews tend to go smoother!\n\nEdit: I should also state that the Research Assistant role would also be excellent, for the same reasons stated before. Perhaps the only advantage to an MRes in my opinion would be first, the possibility of doing rotations in different labs and therefore experiencing different methodologies, and second, often they have introductory lectures that give you a lot of in depth knowledge of the theory and methodologies of the subject you study, which can be really useful. But it's also a good idea to do a Research Assistant role, and many of my students have done that successfully!\n\nEdit 2: I would not suggest working during an MRes. You will 100% spread yourself too thin and lessen the amount you get from your MRes. You get out what you put in so I'd put in 100% if I were you!",

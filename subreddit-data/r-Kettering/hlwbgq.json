I know that probably it's not the best option to go for the bookstore just because it can be so expensive in to rather go for somewhere where I can either rent what do some type of Amazon thing or maybe become a pirate but I doubt it.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has any advice on what I can save on or what I should do? I know that cengage has an unlimited kind of service where I don't know though if it includes the wileyplus material for my physics and math classes in the future.. Webassign is what I'm thinking of.\n\nCs 101\nEcon 201 \nMath 203 - multivariate calculus\n\nGoing into CE or CS\n\nThanks again for helping me out lol",

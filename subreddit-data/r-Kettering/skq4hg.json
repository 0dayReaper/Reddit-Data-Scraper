            "comment": "I had her for Senior Design which is independent so I'm not going to answer the poll, but the class did have issues with her communication style and her changing dates/requirements/assignments sometimes. She started the term off really chill and relaxed but became more strict and removed as time went on. Not to a crazy level tho, she still did nice things here and there. And in the end I think she graded really easy. It was her first term teaching so take this review with a grain of salt, she could be totally different now.",

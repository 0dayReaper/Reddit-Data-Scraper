When I asked I.T what was going on, they said that my account had been closed. I asked if I could have temporary access to get my data, to which I was promptly told to pound sand. Your situation might be different since you'll be an alum, but my lesson learned here was to always back up my cloud data.",

They said that my alumni email will be made before my student email gets deactivated and that I can transfer my drive to the new account when that happens.\n\nThough at this point I am 1 year \"graduated\" and I still don't have access to my alumni account.  So idk\n\nAt least I still have access to my student account",

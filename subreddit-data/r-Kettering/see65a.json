            "comment": "While I appreciate the creativity, several issues come to mind.\n\n1) A lot of classrooms aren't big enough to allow for that sort of separation.\n\n2) Even if they were big enough, it's not clear to me if most classrooms are ventilated enough for that segregation to be effective in reducing transmission.   It's like the old days when airplanes had smoking and non-smoking sections; if someone was smoking, the entire plane became a smoking section.  (This is an honest question; I don't understand transmissibility in closed spaces.)\n\n3) Segregating the class into online and in-person groups is an interesting idea, until you ask the question: should the maskers or the anti-maskers be forced online?  Both groups are tired of dealing with the other, and view the other group as the party \"at fault\".   Both groups would say that the other group should conform if they want to attend in-person.   (And that's before we talk about how much hybrid classes suck.).  \n\nHaving said all of that ... creative ideas are going to be the only way we find a way through this.   Maybe this is a starting point for other ideas.",

Sure, you're not in a completely different room, but it's called compromise. \n\nThose who are uncomfortable, put their mask on, get their boosters and minimize close proximity with the unmasked and unvaxxed. \n\nThose who are comfortable, be respectful of those who aren't by minimizing close proximity to them. \n\nNot a perfect solution for either side, but it's a hell of a let's meet in the middle.",

But it could be taken even a step further, where people that don't want to wear a mask and the people that want to and don't care if other people don't can go in person. But if you don't want to be in that situation just do online.",

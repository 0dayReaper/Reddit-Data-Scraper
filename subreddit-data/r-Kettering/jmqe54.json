They make it seem to the public that Kettering is seriously cracking down on it but while I was on my school term that was a serious joke. Kids were getting locked out of the dorms when they went to the nurses office if they were suspected of having COVID. That\u2019s just while I was there. In the past two weeks of this term students said there was an electrical fire in the dorm, but Kettering said that it was a malfunction at consumers energy that caused a bunch of steam to get released. Who knows what happened. And now Kettering isn\u2019t paying their software licenses lol Things have just been real wacky recently",

Looks like it finally went dry and administration forgot about it until now.  Email chains indicate that they want to negotiate a new contract with Siemens but haven't started yet.",

Kettering has been open longer than any other school in Michigan during COVID and had minimal cases. \n\nBTW, there was no fire.",

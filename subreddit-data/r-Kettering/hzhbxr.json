All of the Greek houses are just doing their best, and in the end it's the University's responsibility to have guidlines that actually prevent exposure. However, I'm also pro-discussion and freedom of information.\n\nFraternities were holding recruitment events on the same days that Sigma Chi and Alpha Phi had self-quarantined. Verifable fact.\n\nMcMahan neglected to share COVID information when it was his own professors that were testing positive. Verifiable fact.\n\nMcMahan readily gave a status update, including Greek affiliations and doing so before anyone was even tested, when it pertained to Greek students. Verifiable fact.\n\nI'm looking for the rumor and cannot find it. Love it or hate it, this meme is spitting straight facts.",

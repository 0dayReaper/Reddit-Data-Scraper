Just do it.",

I ended up just staying in my room and going out of town a lot and so I never met anyone. I had a miserable time socially. During my second term, I moved halls and joined a lot of clubs/etc. and it changed everything!! Friends help immensely",

Depending on the department, they might be too busy to make a full assessment of where you are at when you register for classes\n* See if you can pick up any minors while you are here, I am getting a minor in both economics and statistics since the Computer Science curriculum is very open to what classes you can take\n* Don't live in the dorms any longer than you have to. Campus Village across the street has apartments for the same price, usually cheaper than dorms and you can easily find houses to rent around the area \n* KU-ePay allows you to pay for your term on a payment plan which is very helpful\n* The university president has office hours once a month that anyone can go to and say Hi or ask questions. Additionally, some other people including the Provost are active on campus and love to chat with students\n* Take all the grips and complaints on this subreddit with a grain a salt",

Clubs and extracurricular are good.\n\nThe classes can be intense. Most classes take what other universities do in a 16 week semester, but Kettering crams it into 10. You are often expected to do a lot of the teaching yourself.\n\nFind a good co-op. 99% will hire you when you graduate.\n\nIt is a great education if you can keep up. Don't expect an easy ride",

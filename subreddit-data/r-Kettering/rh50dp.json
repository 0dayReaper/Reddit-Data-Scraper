But still, limited access??\n\nEdit: they said \"There will be no check-in stations or health screenings for faculty, staff and students. Guests still are required to enter at the main doors of the Campus Center to sign in with Campus Safety and complete a health screening.\", so technically they didn't say all doors will be open, just no more check in stations. I'd imagine no check in stations would also be all doors accessible though...",

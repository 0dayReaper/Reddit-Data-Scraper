Friend of mine took her diff eq course while I was in O'Tooles and comparing the two, I remember noting her tests were way way harder.",

She will toss in trig substitutions on tests that have nothing to do with integrations at all, just to make your life hell.\n\nIt's a goddamn shame McCartin is dead. He was the best there ever was.",

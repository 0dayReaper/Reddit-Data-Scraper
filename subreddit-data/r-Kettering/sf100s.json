What do you like what do you dislike etc . Things I should know if I do decide to go there. My parents went there back before when it was still GMI so I\u2019m sure things have changed since then. Any help would be greatly appreciated",

            "comment": "As a senior 2 Electrical Engineering major if you're coming to kettering it's because you want to be working half of the year instead of being in school for 3/4 of it. The EE department has about 2 good professors the rest are ok at best. The math department is pretty solid you just gotta hope you don't get the really hard profs. As someone who did get into one of the big three automotive OEMs kettering is one of the best ways to do that but it's still not a guarantee. Overall if you prefer more time in the field than in school and you want alot of experience on your resume when you get out...great school!! If you want to enjoy your academics and not be screwed by a Prof or two while cramming for a test every other week.... Then find a school with 16 week semesters and better academic ratings. Also don't forget the thesis project you need to do to graduate, that can be pretty stressful.\n\nAs for life on campus, no one here is impressed by dorm life here, which is why fraternities are so big. you want out of your first year in the kettering cell blocks asap but you wanna keep close with all the friends you make. And being it's such a small campus you will make alot of friends. This frats with their better food and housing sound really appealing. Btw it's not hard to have better food than kettering dining services. \n\nSo overall campus is... well in flint.\nThe students here are great.\nThe staff here is hit or miss.\nThe profs are best for MEs and Math but every degree had it's rough ones\nThe dorms are meh\nThe food is meh\nThe cost is very sucky compared to what you get\nThe work opportunity is plentiful\nThe networking is awesome\nAnd the over all experience makes you feel like you can conquer the world if you make it through to see your diploma. (I assume, but I'm can see the light at the end of the tunnel and the air is beginning to smell sweet)\n\nSo yes kettering is a good school. You will learn, you will get a job, but it won't be easy, and you're probably gunna have to borrow money.",

            "comment": "I transferred here in 2015 and graduated in 2018 in computer science. I would say I didn't regret coming here. My perspective may be different since I am now in a PhD program, and knew I wanted to go to grad school early on. The co-op was a good experience for me to make sure I know what working in industry was like and solidified my decision to go to grad school. My co-op experience wasn't great (I was underpaid and it wasn't something that I was passionate about) but it helped me figure out what I wanted and didn't want out of my career.\n\nClasses wise, for the most part I had a pretty good experience. It was definitely intense, but looking back it prepared me well for graduate school. They gave me a good foundation for continuing my CS education. \n\nOne thing I wished I did more as a KU student was have more of a social life. A school like this isn't really known for it and it's definitely harder to get involved if you're not in a sorority or fraternity. I would say that's the biggest downside of going here. You'd have to try hard to get that stereotypical college experience. Now that I'm in a school with a greater liberal arts presence (and a more traditional type of campus) I do feel like I missed out on a lot. It's a very typical engineering school (e.g. gender ratio, lots of introverts, etc), so that's your main limitation.\n\nOverall I think career-wise, KU is a good choice especially if you're in engineering and don't want to go to grad school. If you know what you want to do with your career, go to KU. Otherwise, if you're not so sure I'd go to a bigger state school.\n\nEdit: one thing I forgot to mention was that I really enjoyed the small class sizes and lack of TAs. I think my 400 level courses had like 6-7 people. And you got personalized attention from profs. Now that I've been a TA for a class of 75 people, I realized how lucky I was.\n\nEdit 2: thanks kind stranger! Here's to all my homies in B section",

You can botch your thesis and not graduate. It's in Flint.",

            "comment": "From my experience, being a junior currently, I\u2019d say it\u2019s absolutely worth it. At the very least it is worth trying. I\u2019d venture to say Kettering is one of if not the only university you can go to and almost immediately find out if you really want to be an engineer. You\u2019ll find that out quickly through your co-op as well as the accelerated courses. Furthermore, your co-op should give you some valuable insight into what area of engineering you want to go into once you graduate. Now, this is assuming you take charge of your co-op experience. There are many students who will get a co-op where they sit around all day or a co-op that doesn\u2019t necessarily fit their desired job description and they won\u2019t take any steps to find another one or try different things to see what they like. This won\u2019t help you figure anything out. Along with this, the universities co-op advisors will not help you find a job unless you are unemployed, or you quit your current job before asking for help. All that this means is that if you want to switch jobs in a reasonable way without going unemployed first, you are on your own to find openings and apply for them. Personally I have had a total of four different jobs since starting here in 2019, all of them I have gotten without any help from the co-op department. Maybe I am different from most students in terms of what I think my co-op experience should be, but I\u2019m not gonna stay in a co-op position if I have nothing to do. I didn\u2019t have much trouble finding openings, given I am an ME with an EE minor, which is pretty common. Overall I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it, and the opportunities are much more abundant here than a standard university to find out what aspects of engineering you like",

It has amazing qualities but there's a few downsides that drag it down a bit\n\nMy personal pros and cons would be:\n\nPros\n\n- Co-op model \n\n- Lots of freedom (we can drive as freshman, can go to this maker space dang near whenever, and no curfew with dorms)\n\n- Didnt have a ton of textbooks to buy \n\n- Many resources to take advantage of if you're struggling \n\n- Tunnels pretty much everywhere but Einstein's so you don't have to walk in the cold\n\n- No roommates (kinda. You have this door in-between your suit mate but you don't gotta open it if you don't wanna \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nCons\n\n- Can be a bit more stressful than it usually would be with you also needing to think about where you'll work during school\n\n- Poor communication\n\n- Location is...questionable.\n\n- Recorded lectures are very hit or miss so if you're ever out with an illness uh gl\n\n- Moving out every three months (unless you're an international student I believe. Not entirely sure tho) is a hassle and kinda made it hard to settle in\n\n- Quiet hours are pretty much ignored 99% of the time (not horribly so and can change based on your class but mine at least acted like they ain't have no sense half the time)\n\n- Very expensive \n\n\nDefinitely up to your own preferences and how much you can handle with that sort of stuff but it's a decent school overall",

            "comment": "Depends on your major. I think Kettering is a solid mid tier that fumbled a bit during covid. I'm a CS major with 3 semesters left. I started fall 2020, so I've mostly done virtual semesters. I think that the co-op model is the model of the future, as experiential learning is super valuable, especially in CS. If you can land a job at one of the top co ops, you'll probably be set for the rest of your career. I will say though, it often feels like CS is treated as a secondary major in the sense that MEs are presented with so many resources and co-ops while CS has to wait possibly 2 years to see an elective they want. Great department head and a couple great profs. I went to an IB school, so I find myself coasting every semester (I can count on my fingers the total number of lectures I've attended and still have a 3.9). Overall,  I think Kettering is for people who want to spend less time in school and more time actually working in their field (which has a great return on investment). I think if you prefer something more traditional, CS at Umich would have been my alternative (top ranked CS program that attracts way better tech companies). Personally though, I had no problem blazing my own path and breaking into big tech myself (Amazon internship this summer that will more than double my pay at Ford). Just don't expect help from the co-op department when aiming big. At the end of the day though, any school is what you make of it. Feel free to ask any questions.",

Most profs and classes are nice, but administration has appeared to be, for lack of a better word, incompetent recently. With their response to covid and general lack of communication it shows a side to Kettering that they don\u2019t want potential students like yourself to see. \n\nWith that said, I don\u2019t believe Kettering is a bad school. There\u2019s a lot more work than high school had, some of the profs are mean but most are reasonable and fair when it comes to it, and you can get a lot out of this school.",

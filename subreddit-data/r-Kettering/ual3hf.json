            "comment": "Academically speaking, it's excellent. The faculty is generally pretty good, the engineering degree programs are good, though the pure science ones I've heard mixed opinions on. Business program is not worth it. The Co-op/school balance is pretty great, as 3 months on 3 months off is good at keeping you engaged, and the accelerated semesters cut out a lot of useless fluff.\n\nWhere you run into problems are the non-teaching administration, especially where their decisions about academic direction conflict with the opinions of the teaching staff. Generally, the teaching staff is more interested in what's better for you as a student. Lettering, when I graduated in 2020, was going through a bit of a tightening the belt phase with respect to underclassmen level instruction, and investing more into the Learning Commons building as a halo project to advertise to potential new students. It's also not particularly fun having to pack you crap into a car and move it every 3 months, though it's worth it I would say.\n\nThey require you to live in the dorms for the first year. Many people don't like being forced to do this, and it is the least cost-effective housing, but I think it's a good policy for getting underclassmen to meet with each other outside of class. Curriculum at an engineering school is more rigorous, though not impossible, and the worst thing you can do to sabotage yourself is to hole up in your room or only stick to your old friend from from high school, because it's orders of magnitude easier to get through if you have a support structure to rely on to study for difficult classes like Differential Equations. Building out that friend group during your freshman dorm year makes it worth the cost.\n\nEveryone likes to complain about their school, especially if it's expensive, and Kettering definitely is. The difference is that even if you're not in the top lf your class, it's still a springboard to a career that has the potential to pay for that degree without forcing you to live substandardly throughout your 20s. If you didn't get a scholarship and/or financial assistance covering at least 25% of the cost, it's probably not worth it, but if you did, I think it is. Just don't procrastinate when it comes time to do your thesis.",

It ultimately depends on what you want to do in your career. If you're fairly certain you want to pursue a career in engineering/in the auto industry, Kettering is great for that. The only reason I'd tell someone not to come here is if they weren't sure if that's what they wanted, for example if they might change majors to music or English or something.",

The likelyhood of you having a full time offer to your co-op before you even graduate is pretty high these days.\n\nIn terms of the academics there are probably more enjoyable schools out there. Our labs here are fairly dated in the EE department. But I've been told it's different if you're an ME. They have better newer stuff over in the Mott building (I'm a SRIII EE so I wouldn't know). Also if you stress easily keep in mind semesters are compressed not just shorter so it's very fast paced. \n\nOverall the opportunities the school provides both personally and in your career are worth it if it seems like the right fit for you.",

As for why would you pick Kettering over another school, it\u2019s the co-op program.\n\nIf you are ok with switching between school and work every 3 months then go for it, just remember that things can feel a little fast paced and depending on your co-op moving every 3 months can get annoying\n\nI will also say that depending on what major you pick, the quality of your education can vary as some professors are better than others but that\u2019s true for every college\n\nAnd choosing between A or B section can also change your experience here, from what I heard, A and B section have different vibes (I\u2019m not gonna say which one is better because I don\u2019t know the other section very well anyway)",

Everyone I meet is their own genuine self here. Our greek life is so unique from any other college as well and really has a place for everyone. Now what I will say is that Kettering is not for everyone. You will be challenged in some way, whether that is academically, emotionally, or socially. Those who are passionate and strong willed will do amazing at this school. If you arent looking for a challenge, and don't need the extra work experience, then this might not be the school for you. What I know is in the short two terms I have been here so far I have loved every moment and gotten involved in many facets already. The community we have on campus is amazing and you will get to know everyone very quickly. I hope this helps!",

Kettering isn\u2019t an easy college it\u2019s hard work but once you graduate it\u2019ll be worth it especially if you put yourself out there and met new people and had new experiences along the way.",

I'm pretty sure there's a special robotics class that's offered in ECE some terms. Kettering is pretty big with FIRST but I never took part in it, but I know people who love it. It's obviously not the only school associated with FIRST though.\n\nNot sure where else you got accepted but it's a lot more common for other schools to have co-op programs nowadays, so if you're on the fence because of Flint, the lack of school spirit, or the tiny size, just know you can get good internship/co-op experiences at a more traditional university that's not as depressing as Kettering (sorry I'm quite biased). Plus these other schools can be associated with more industries than just primarily automotive. \n\nJust make sure to do thorough research through all of your other options before choosing to go to Kettering. Most people only come to Kettering for the co-op but really dislike the school portion. Plus if you have a shitty co-op, it just sucks all of the value out of Kettering especially since they are cocks about switching co-ops because they wanna keep their corporate relations strong.",

I don\u2019t really get the benefits of the school spirit. I only heard bad things about flint but I don\u2019t really what it actually feels like because I haven\u2019t actually experienced it. I been hearing things about the new building that Kettering haven\u2019t been advertising about it said it\u2019s construction will be done by this summer, will that help with experience at KU? \n\nI live in Indiana and I applied to Rose Hulman at first because that\u2019s where my high school robotics team is at. Also that It\u2019s been the number 1 undergraduate engineering program for 22 years. And from what I heard from my robotics mentors(they are all Rose Hulman students)know that it has a family environment,  although the courses are challenging there, the school environment is nice and there plenty of opportunities out there so you can make it work, schools provides many fun activities you can do outside of the classroom. But I got rejected so rip, the school has 70% acceptance rate but everyone applies there have 4.0 unweighted average gpa. I didn\u2019t think much about backup plans when I applied there, I just googled top engineering schools Indiana and applied all of them with no application fee with the exception of Kettering that\u2019s the only one that\u2019s out of the state for me. \n\nWhen I was planning on the transferring there the 2nd year I thought about going to a small engineering school and Trine Uni was the top choice in this category. But that\u2019s before I realized that i also applied to Kettering. The 2.5 years work experience when graduate sounds nice, I\u2019ve been advised by my graduate friend now works at meta that internship is more important than schools. The average internship that Rose Hulman students get is around 2-3 which are getting from the summer internships. I am really considering staying at Kettering",

If you\u2019re thinking about trying to transfer there at some point, definitely try and see how the credits would transfer BEFORE you commit to Kettering.

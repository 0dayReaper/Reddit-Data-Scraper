Go find Larry Tech\u2019s 990 and let me know if it\u2019s any less.\n\nEdit: I searched for myself, Larry tech\u2019s pres makes 500k. Rose Hulman\u2019s makes 604k. Rochester Institute of Technology\u2019s makes 841k. Seems like it\u2019s well within the range of highly qualified private tech schools, and he did navigate the water crisis and built a dope ass building on campus. He\u2019s easy to hate, but I certainly believe if the last pres was still in charge Kettering would have shut down in 2017.",

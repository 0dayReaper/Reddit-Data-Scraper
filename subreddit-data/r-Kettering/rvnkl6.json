Given the sudden pivot online in Fall Term when the HVAC collapse finally led to the AB being uninhabitable, I'm sure a bad-weather event would be handled similarly.",

And Kettering needs to hold them accountable to work with their students, instead of enabling the professors to be lackluster. Thank god engineering fundamentals haven\u2019t changed or else Kettering would have been left in the dust years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s got to be a two way street, and if it isn\u2019t, something needs to change.  These crusty ass professors need to know that education is the goal, not endangering students lives.",

A number of professors have poor Internet connectivity at home --- or, at least poor enough that they can't livestream their lectures from home without tons of signal drops.   For them, it's a whole lot better to stream from their offices.",

Campus immediately went totally dark.   (Some of you who were on-campus during the power outage in Summer 2019 remember what that was like.)   After an hour, word finally got around campus that we were cancelling for the day.\n* Tuesday: the power was back, but overnight, we had a bad ice storm --- bad enough that at 10am, TPTB gave up and cancelled class for the rest of the day.   (Which was really annoying to me because I'd sucked it up and made it to campus across all those icy roads for my 8am lab.)   This was also extremely unusual, because in that era, the Administration would *never* cancel class for anything.\n* Friday: right around 11:45am, a squirrel decided to explore the inside of a power transformer and lost, taking the whole transformer down.   A few minutes later, messengers were running around to all the classrooms saying \"we're powering everything down in 10 minutes, shut everything down now\".   So we lost that whole afternoon.\n\nWe did have a two-day shutdown of campus in January 2014 due to extreme cold and icy roads --- but that happened during 0th Week of Winter term, so Kettering didn't lose any instructional time.   (Mostly, they shutdown campus because all the faculty were staying home anyways, and shutting down campus allowed the staff to stay off the icy roads.)",

We got at least one snow day out of that, I think two.\n\nI recall talking to my grandpa (GMI grad 1950) and he said in his 5 years there was only one snow day.\n\nBefore this remote instructional stuff when the only option was in class, admin rarely cancelled class.",

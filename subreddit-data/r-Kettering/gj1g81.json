            "comment": "I'll start you off by telling you if you're trying to do something for your own personal use you'd do yourself a favor to learn solidworks. if you dont have a license later on its way cheaper.\n\nthat aside, NX is available for download through blackboard if you're able to get it to work under the UG license agreement which you need to accept before it shows you the downloads for the various versions of NX for Mac Windows and Linux. After it has been downloaded you need to set up a VPN to connect to the schools network for the licensing servers to authorize your version of NX is legit. ketterings site will try to give you the cisco VPN client when you need the forticlient VPN linked deeper in their webpage on mykettering. not going to share any links as they would either not work for you or would work and could potentially allow many people who shouldnt be remoting into the network to do so. it can be found under instructional administrative and information technology &gt; Technology Support &gt; Wireless and Networks &gt; VPN (Virtual Private Network). From there you need to ignore the left bar and click on the video or the forticlient VPN help sheet to go further. after you have connected to the schools network and downloaded NX its as easy as opening NX and it should run. if it doesnt run the installer again and it should prompt you for a license server. you do need to log into the VPN every time you disconnect from it in order to relaunch NX.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoving onto why solidworks is good. its similarly fully featured to NX but it feels a lot less clunky to move around after a couple of hours of getting used to the different environment. sketches break less in my experience and it runs much faster with more intuitive constraining and an easier function menu to control parts. I still havent found one CAD software thats able to be the best for every project out there but Solidworks is my go to for now it also has free student licenses through most universities that dont require a VPN to connect to and are relatively affordable if you want to use solidworks after you've finished your education. absolute worst case you can use KU cloud to connect to the remotely hosted desktops at kettering and do any NX work you need there, but its about 4x slower and extremely frustrating to use as it makes an already clunky software impossibly difficult to use. Its a fun thing to show off to other people though and say \"this is what I have to deal with\".",

                    "comment": "+1 \nJust get solidworks. There use to be a download link in the entrance to the Mott building, not sure if it's still there or not. I have a picture of the flyer on my phone I can send if needed. Solidworks is a lot easier to learn on I feel like, and makes more sense than NX. I use Catia at work, and I feel like it's a lot closer to Solidworks than NX (made by the same company so that's part of the reason). If you are just coming into Kettering, you'll need it for Keddy's class (Mech 100), but you can just use KUCloud, I never bothered downloading it.",

SolidWorks is FAR better than NX, and I also never touched it after MECH-100.\n\nNot enough people know that you can get SolidWorks for free through KU, so I would definitely recommend the flyer for people that haven't seen it floating around. Not only do you get the main CAD program, you also get CAM, SolidWorks electrical, and all sorts of things when you download it.",

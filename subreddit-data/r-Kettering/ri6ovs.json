Class was relatively easy overall, though when I took it there were fairly common homework assignments (mightve been an online vs in person thing?). Try your best to pay attention and take good notes, and failing that at least mark down the topics being covered so you can go back into the book to prepare yourself for the exams. I've heard Nam is much better at explaining direct questions one-on-one, though I didnt make much use of that when I took the class",

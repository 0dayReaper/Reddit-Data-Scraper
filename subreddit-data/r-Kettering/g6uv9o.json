Kettering needs to hold its self accountable.\n\nThe school dosent like that we hid who we are when there\u2019s a problem. I\u2019ve talked to dean hoff about my struggles with online learning and he said not enough people are complaining so to him and the administration it looks like it\u2019s just me with issues \n\nIf more people email the Kettering administration directly, and are NICE in their email, the Kettering staff will be more likely to help us",

Before class I would ask if he received my email (thought process: maybe I typed the address wrong\u00bf) and he would look me dead in the eyes and say \u201cI got your email I didn\u2019t reply cause you just need to follow the road map\u201d then I\u2019d go and fail said quiz cause I didn\u2019t understand the fundamentals of the problem.\n\nThis happened 3 times one of which was the final project that took place of the exam.",

            "comment": "Seems about right for Berry. I had him last year for fluids and every chapter he brought a thick ass packet for each student. For someone who sent out an email saying \"this is the 21st century\" he sure loves killing trees. \n\nEven in person, he wasn't much better. He wasn't very responsive to emails, was very \"my way or the highway\", and would shame and fight with students during class. A girl in class he clearly wasn't a fan of failed a quiz and he said out loud with a smirk \"looks like you didn't do so well\" in front of the whole class and used her quiz as an example of \"what not to do\". \n\nFor our final exam, he was 30 mins late and still had us take a survey about how great he was before we were allowed to work on the exam. He even forced another class's exam to move locations because we had to overstay our section. \n\nGranted his study sessions were very helpful but aside from that small up, I'll probably never forget him for bad reasons. He did slightly open up about his past to us, which was clearly a pretty bitter life, but that doesn't excuse him being the way he is.",

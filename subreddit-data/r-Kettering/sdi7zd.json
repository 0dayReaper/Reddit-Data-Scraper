He is the one being payed the big bucks to make the big decisions. \n\nMcMahan should have been the one to decide the mask policy, it\u2019s a big decision. And, working 80 hrs a week on average (2019 IRS 990) gives McMahan lots of time to make these decisions.\n\nThe decision should not be left up to faculty, they have enough to worry about (i.e. teaching students). Faculty is going to take the heat no matter what decision they make on their mask policy. It\u2019s no longer, \u201cit\u2019s the administrations decision, not mine.\u201d \n\nFaculty has enough to worry about, do your job President McMahan and the rest of the Administration. \n\nPresident McMahan should know by now that these decisions aren\u2019t easy, as we are 2 years into a pandemic. Yet, he still passed the responsibility of policy off to the Faculty.",

Not every decision the President of a company makes is announced on their letterhead and under their signature. I\u2019m sure Kettering wouldn\u2019t change their policy on Covid without the President having the final say. \n\nThe way I read it it\u2019s not about who gets to take heat (why are you giving anyone heat anyway?) it\u2019s about people being able to make their own decisions about the risks they take. If you wanna wear a mask wear a mask, wear 2, wear 3. Your choice.\n\nAt some point we all need to stop expecting to be treated like children and told and just take responsibility for what we do, and that includes how we put others at risk.  Otherwise it just makes it sound like you want to be told what to do so you can be pissed off at somebody even though you know it\u2019s probably the right thing to do. That\u2019s bogus.",

I'd think that if professors indicated that they are requiring masks, they'd be able to take those same actions. If not, that is a *major* oversight that needs to be corrected. (Although, for all I know, professors couldn't really do anything about it before, we just never saw it happen. Which is still a really bad edge case to ignore.)\n\nAs for being seen as a jerk, I don't think the opinions of students who are themselves jerks matter all that much, as long as the University administration gives you power to enforce a mask rule and supports your decision to do so. If the University administration refuses to support its professors, we have a major problem. We already have a problem if students don't respect their professors enough to follow such a simple requirement in the first place, but I don't know how we as a community can fix it.",

At which point, someone will complain that I'm imposing a rule that wasn't in my syllabus when the course began.\n\n\"Or writing them up?\"\n\nI have no idea what \"writing them up\" means.

Flunking a student for failing to wear a mask has nothing to do with the content of the course --- as I'm sure the student will shout from the rooftop over and over again as they appeal my decision to every administrator they can find.\n\n\"The results \\[of the masking rules\\] in terms of the number of Covid cases on campus were pretty much the same in both cases.\"\n\nYou're comparing Delta with Omicron, which isn't a valid comparison.\n\n\"You simply don\u2019t want to be the heavy.

My large company job requires masks and it\u2019s not because we can\u2019t make our own decisions, it\u2019s because they see how masks have kept our factories open and the people safe. Sometimes when you agree to work somewhere or go to a school, you follow protocols to keep you and others safe instead of making a \u201cdecision about the risks they take\u201d. Want to make your own risks? Tell that to your manager when you don\u2019t follow lock out protocol and see how that goes. Heads up, you\u2019re going to get fired.",

Leading up to the celebration, we were bombarded with emails asking us to donate money and \u201cprove our section is better\u201d all for a concert we didn\u2019t even get to have, which was greatly over costed. \n\nWhen you think if a standard Kettering student, chances are you probably don\u2019t image someone who listens to T-Pain. You probably imagine a generally quiet, shy engineering guy who wants to just get their work done and get out. The average Kettering student was not kept in mind while planning this event whatsoever. Especially if the rumored 8 million dollar price tag on the event is true, then a lot of the outrage could be seen as justified. Have you ever felt as if a part of Kettering hasn\u2019t been up to what it should be / could have been improved? \n\nT-Pain honestly felt more of something the faculty wanted than something the student body wanted, especially after hearing that instead of preforming his concert when it was canceled he instead went to meet with faculty / higher ups at the school. And reminder, this \u2018\u2019meet and greet\u201d was paid for by each and every one of our tuitions.",

It was a being put on for the city as part of the 100 year celebration as a thank you (for what I don\u2019t know, but it explains the artist choice):\n\n[https://www.kettering.edu/news/kettering-university-announces-t-pain-headliner-its-centennial-fest](https://www.kettering.edu/news/kettering-university-announces-t-pain-headliner-its-centennial-fest)\n\n\u201cThe Kettering Centennial Fest, which is free to the community, is a way to thank the Flint community during the University\u2019s 100th year as an institution... We are putting on this celebration to say thank you to the great city of Flint, our home, and the fantastic people who live here. We invite the community to come out July 20 to Atwood Stadium to help us celebrate our one hundred years in this community\u201d\n\nClearly, the event wasn\u2019t intended for students, although they got tickets too. And 8 million dollars? Seriously? There are rumors, and then there are delusions. Kid Rock wouldn\u2019t get that, much less Tpain.\n\nSure there are things that could be improved, aren\u2019t as good as they should be,  but show me any place where that isn\u2019t true. They have always listened to me when I had a complaint or suggestion, and more often than not do something about it. But then I speak to them directly, don\u2019t slam them at the start and  I don\u2019t post my complaints anonymously on social and think that should take care of it. They can\u2019t fix what they don\u2019t know and I have found they are (mostly) good people who care a lot about students.\n\n*And reminder, this \u2018\u2019meet and greet\u201d was paid for by each and every one of our tuitions..*\n\nOr maybe not tuition but event sponsorships (see the ads in Atwood?) or donations\u2026like the learning commons, scholarships, and a lot of other stuff.",

Here's a quote from the site \" When you compare Honorlock to other online proctoring services, you\u2019ll find multiple features that set us apart. Our Search and Destroy\u2122 process helps keep your test information off the Internet, deterring students from sharing answers. Our Live Proctor Pop-In \u2013 combined with AI \u2013 allows proctors to intervene and assist students who may be struggling or not following the rules. And our patented Multi-Device Detection technology deters them from using any secondary devices to access unauthorized information. All of these\u2014and so much more\u2014put us a step above our competitors.\"",

It's not always obvious from this side of the desk when someone is copying answers from elsewhere.   \n\nAccusing someone of cheating is a Big Deal.   If I don't have an open-and-shut case, I don't make the accusation.   That means that occasionally I let stuff go that's suspicious, because being wrong in that situation would do more harm than good.\n\nIn your case, if your classmate had \"mostly the same answers\", I'd guess it'd be impossible to tell from just the answers that he was cheating.\n\n(There's something else I really want to say in response, but it's unfair, so I won't.)",

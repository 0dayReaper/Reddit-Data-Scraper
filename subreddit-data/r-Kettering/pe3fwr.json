    "postText": "Is there any update on professor Deepali Acharya situation? It seems she was listed to teach both electronics and continuous signals for the fall term and honestly, I'm worried. \n\nThese are fundamental high level classes so if not taught correctly then it's going to cause long run issues in future classes which are even more difficult. \n\nI'm sure we can all agree that having a professor that you don't learn from is worse than just a bad grade. If I get to learn then I know how to improve my grade too. But if I'm not getting quizzes back, no actual teaching happening, then that's really concerning. \n\nI know some students that were in her classes were looking to talk to faculty and just wanted to know what happened so far. I really hope the faculty realizes how serious this issue is.",

It really messes up our academic career because how will you teach yourself a whole course later on when you struggle? \n\nMy issue is that if profs are leaving and they are understaffed, that still doesn't mean any person should be made a professor. These individuals are teaching us educational material so I feel there should be more importance given to the fact that this person is a suitable candidate to teach. not only has this prof been given a class to teach after numerous complaints, they have been given high level classes \u2013 and honestly they could have given her a non teaching term so she can sit in and observe another professor.",

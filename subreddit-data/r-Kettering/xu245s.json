    "postText": "I'm a recent Kettering alum. I can with complete sincerity not recommend anyone go to Kettering.\n\nI too once believed that Kettering had my best interest at heart when I was a freshman. For some who work there that may be the case. However, over time I have become disillusioned. My fury can't be contained in one single incident, but I will outline some of the key incidents that have led me to this conclusion (names and pronouns redacted to protect individuals):\n\n- During orientation, my friend heard homophobic slurs thrown out a bus. This wouldn't be the last time for any of us.\n\n- There used to be a transphobic employee working at Einstein's that actively targeted my friend. So many friends refused to come out for fear of themselves or others being targeted.\n\n- A faculty member was reported to HR for asking students their preferred pronouns. Same one who wanted proper accommodations for their hearing disability.\n\n- When the 2020\u2019s George Floyd protests were occurring, black students were targeted for wearing Black Lives Matter materials.\n\n- My best friend at the time, an international student, was shot with a paintball gun several times before the person drove away.\n\n- A current faculty member routinely treated students in an unprofessional and demeaning manner. At one point the person told my peer, \u201c[Myself] is really struggling. Students with slow processing are hard to teach. Maybe Kettering isn't the right place for them\u201d. \n\n- There is a student who has harassed (sexually or otherwise), stalked, and done other triggering things to primarily female students. I\u2019ve lost count how many of my friends have a story, and I am one of them.\n\nYou may think I am simply an angry individual who didn't follow up with the proper channels and instead wants to rant to Reddit under cover of anonymity. A good friend of mine once advised me to play Kettering's game by keeping my head down and to smile without getting too angry. \n\n- Anytime we brought up homophobic/transphobic slurs, the individuals in question might be talked to but the behavior usually continued.\n\n- That faculty member reported to HR? Was treated like the problem, never got accommodations, and eventually left.\n\n- Kettering begged the student minority groups to help come up with a solution. Several student leaders formed the Student Ethics Committee. The problem? All of us were more concerned with how Kettering\u2019s representative would act, especially after a student accidentally recorded a meeting. Even after the recording was deleted in a prompt manner, we were treated like suspects and the committee fizzled out.\n\n- The incident involving the paintball gun was recorded and brought to the police and Campus Safety. No actions were taken. \n\n- Much of the behavior of the unprofessional faculty member was detailed in writing by several students and submitted to the department head. We were promised something would be done. As a student under this professor during this period, not much changed. I could not switch classes during the same term either. This faculty member remains at Kettering.\n\n- I will not elaborate further on the incidents surrounding the student mentioned in the last point to protect the investigations that are underway, but suffice to say Kettering didn't keep this individual away from me. I believe in justice and due process, but I wonder how many women must submit their story before we are believed and kept safe.\n\nKettering wasn't worth my tears, my nightmares, my constant looking over my shoulder. There are events preaching inclusivity, official policy, and countless ways that Kettering tries to tell students who aren't white, cis, straight, and male that we are welcomed. Why were our voices ignored so many times? I was polite, followed channels, and tried educating the campus to change the culture like I was told. I should have been allowed to be a student. I'm angry and so very tired of fighting. \n\nSo no, I don't recommend anyone go to Kettering. The problem can't be traced to any one particular culprit, and for some I am sure there are pleasant experiences. This is my truth and I deserve a right to finally speak it.",

Turns out,  the person who reported it was trying to drum up some drama that didn't exist at the school and seize the spotlight. \n\nWhile I can't recommend kettering for multiple reasons, your list seems to be the topic of Flint itself and not really the school. There was a student damn near beat to death after a failed robbery in the parking lot after hours. Paintballs suck yes, but unless you got peoples plates there isn't much the police can realistically do about it. I could ramble on, but the majority of stuff you're talking about can be found at every school, not just Kettering.",

(So would other explanations, but this one is the most favorable.)  \n\n\n(And it wouldn't be the first time that students know more about what's happening on campus than faculty.)",

            "comment": "If you're recalling the paintball thing to be from this past summer term, I know someone personally who was hit by 2 or 3 of them.\n\nReality of that, is that Flint police have other crimes to handle that are more severe, like those involving lethal consequences.\n\nAre paintballs fun? In the right setting, yes. But definitely not while you're walking along the sidewalk. It definitely is not something that is strictly Kettering, though. It happens all the time, I've been beamed in the forehead when I was 5 and lived in suburbia after the jerk offs shot out 3 windows of my house. Police (who had more personnel and funding than Flint) didn't get the guys.\n\n\nOn the note of homophobia/transphobia, that's everywhere, and you will continue to face it. I'm not suggesting that it's okay to disrespect someone along those lines, but not everyone agrees with it and will make sure you know that they don't like it.\n\n\nAs for the sexual assault/harassment point, if a title 9 report was made and NOT handled appropriately by KU, then there should be a lot of concern. However, Kettering cannot step in for situations they don't know about. Every college in the world has had and will have SA occur on their campus. It is far from okay and should never happen; however, bad people do bad things.\n\n\nIt seems like most of these points that you've made are rather universal among just about every institution imaginable. Oakland University has its own share of issues, same with MTU, U of M, MSU, LTU, and a million other colleges. Faculty will get canned for just about any reason (just like any other workplace), people get reported for minor things, and tons of other problematic things.\n\n\nWelcome to the real world. Nobody cares about how you feel, everyone is for themselves to some degree, and people get treated like trash just because. It's more important to deal with your own smaller circle of friends and family than to worry about everything else that is going on.",

Kettering did and sounds like it still does need a more thorough way to handle problem faculty. \n\nWith that being said, most of this sounds like a Flint problem, and not a Kettering problem. Kettering just so happens to be located in a pretty bad spot (rundown urban with high crime, and also directly north/south of cornfield USA) which leads to both the transphobia/homophobia and the run ins with crime. \n\nNot going to a school based on location is a legitimate reason to warn someone away, but it's not like Kettering can control a lot of that.",

You'll only ever be able to look for places where these things are less likely to happen: \n\n- more affluent places (less poor people)\n\n- more educated places (less hateful/ bigoted people)\n\nI'm guessing you grew up in a suburb somewhere that's very strong in these categories? Never went to public school?",

You post a lot of assumptions and 1- sided stories.   I think everything here can happen at any University or College.  It reads like \"Don't go to college\" in general.  \n\n Honestly,  I can't disagree more on your 6th point about \"unprofessional behavior\". To me,  sounds like the professor was trying do you a solid,  but instead I read your point as looking for handouts.  You can always drop the class.  Maybe they knew of a different Prof with a different teaching style. \n\nIf you are looking for a degree mill, then I'd agree: don't go to Kettering. Kettering is a very tough school,  it is not for everyone,  and that is where and how it gets its prestige in the industry.  I do not want my Alma mater lowering the standards of its education. The school is practically in Downtown Flint on publicly accessible roads.  The school cannot control who is on busses or in restaurants. I do know the school is working A LOT with the city trying to improve it.\n\nThe only reason I'd not recommend Kettering is the location.  Flint sucks.  The education &amp; the co-op though,  is the reason to go.",

Yes there is real value to the coop program and yes some of the professors are fantastic both as people and as instructors. That does not excuse the systemic problems present at the institutional level. Some very good engineers come out of kettering, granted, I would generally argue those same engineers would've done just as well at any other school due to their personal drive for success. This school does nothing but filter out students who either lack the financial opportunities or willingness to push past a combination of truly awful instructors and a school administration so neglectful that even the councilors complain about it. This school has the same ups and downs that I'm sure many schools have, the major difference in my eyes is that this school gives its student's nothing to be prideful for other than passing through the gauntlet, and also is significantly more expensive than most other schools in the state while providing classes that don't even transfer to their equivalent level at other universities.",

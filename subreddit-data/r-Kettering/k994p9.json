            "comment": "We need to refuse to use it. This is blatant spyware with the KU stamp of approval, and students paying out the ass for it is our consent.\n\nHonorLock is being implemented to cover for teachers that are unwilling to put in the necessary work to make online classes work (and these are online classes, I don't care what BS Kettering is trying to sell about this being 'virtual delivery'). This system will only help the teachers that reuse the same exam for 20 years and get mad when students find 15 year old cribs that have the exact quiz that was just assigned.\n\nStudents using online resources like Chegg is only a problem in a timed environment if the question is **already** on Chegg. I hate that it has taken a global pandemic for institutions to realize that if the professors get questions from Chegg, the students are liable to find the answers there too.",

Just talk about the inevitable problems it will cause, such as: identity theft, privacy violations, and the simple fact that the shitty internet in flint makes it prohibitive for all students to use it and still be able to participate in class.",

I also agree that if Kettering sees that incoming students are seeing the issues by blasting social media accounts we can get more pull.",

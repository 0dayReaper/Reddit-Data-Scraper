    "postText": "Hi there.\n\nI\u2019m using a different account, but it\u2019s u/TrueFee7724.\n\nI want to thank everyone for what they said and their support. But I just want to explain the reason I got fired as best as I can without being too biased or getting too angry. I won\u2019t be naming the company or any names or the exact tasks.\n\nSo basically, I got hired in mid-November. I didn\u2019t try to get a co-op while in the previous term because I honestly did not care, and when I got this one it was like a miracle. When I thought I\u2019d be doing more research oriented tasks, I was instead told that I\u2019d mainly be doing lab prep, including setting up the tests by cutting plastic tubes. I was told they had to be perfectly circular, with no bumps or squished anywhere.\n\nSo it seemed easy to me and I started. But after doing it a few dozen times, it becomes hard to tell how perfect it is and if it\u2019s up to standard, so I basically just cut and used as many as I possibly could, throwing any away that seemed too squished.\n\nWell after about a week, I was told that I was using too many by my supervisor, and that I had cost the company money because of the faulty tests, which apparently weren\u2019t circular enough. We had a thorough talk about this, with people showing me that I could be more liberal in throwing them away, and since I was already in trouble, I did exactly that, threw out more and took more time to make they were circular and good enough for the tests.\n\nOne day when I enter my space I see a bag of all the tubes I threw out and my supervisor calls me into her office. She changed her attitude to very serious, and said that I threw away TOO MANY tubes this time, and that I had wasted even more of her time because they had to wait for new order of the tubes, even though I did exactly what she told me to do. She said that people were now angry and frustrated with me, and that she had to take time off to inspect the tubes herself, and then she fired me, and told me to never come back. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything because she\u2019s extremely talkative, and would probably shoot any argument I had down with some other reason, and I could tell she though I was too stupid to try and state my side, so I just replied with \u201cI understand\u201d gave her my keycard, and left feeling like a failure. When I looked at my employee report, she did not give me credit for the term, meaning I wasted my entire time there. She also said that research was not my field (even though I barely did any of that, and was not related to why I got fired) and said I should probably drop out.\n\nI haven\u2019t talked to anyone from there since, and since I filled out my employer report only a couple weeks, I couldn\u2019t state what I truly felt, basically being the dishwasher at a restaurant when you wanted to be the cook, and being fired like you were the cook. I know the seems more like a rant, but I\u2019d be welcome to any comments and other POV.\n\nEdit: should I talk to my supervisor about how I feel, since I think she could\u2019ve done more than just do her own thing most of the time, and almost not check up on anything herself, or just leave it be?",

            "comment": "Honestly, lots of co-ops do these sort of things since students are new in the professional field and are easily intimidated because in their mind the authority figure is always supposed to be fair and understanding - but in reality, no one is really there to be understanding or spend time explaining any of these tasks. \n\nIf any co-workers or your supervisor advises you to do some activity a certain way, then make sure you send a follow up email so you have it for your record. In your case, it was being liberal in disposing of the tubes that became defective. I would suggest next time just sending an email and saying: \n\n\"hey [name], I want to follow up regarding our discussion and confirm that this is what we agreed on [insert whatever youd discussed].\" \n\nAlso, you can reach out to the supervisor and be like my job description and current job responsibilities do not align accordingly and you would like to do more work that matches the job description. This will also help you for your records later because it seems like your supervisor is trying to cover the fact they had you do work that was completely unrelated to what you were expecting and then said you didnt do what you were supposed to because it would reflect badly on your supervisor if they admitted to what they actually did in your case. \n\nThese things will help you when you reach out to your co op advisor at Kettering because they will have a clear understanding of what happened and have a ground to stand on to get you your job back (if you wanted to return)",

And never be scared to ask for something in writing like through email when you are asked to verbally do something or even to say \u201cjust to clarify you said I can or can\u2019t do this\u201d. Especially when it\u2019s unclear, or you\u2019re uncomfortable with what you are asked. \n\nSome co-op employers don\u2019t seem to understand we are supposed to be actual employees and treated as such. So whenever I\u2019ve had issues I\u2019ve went about it like I was a full time employee (contact HR, pushing back on my supervisor).\n\nThis last co-op term of mine our department has a company card with a 10k limit and my supervisor (a director) had asked me to buy 6k worth of exhaust testing parts for testing with the card instead of a PO because that way accounting and his supervisor didn\u2019t see it. I clearly stated what I was asked in the email and told him I would like him to approve this action through email because I felt uncomfortable not doing it the proper way.\n\nWe are supposed to be learning at our co-ops and being taught how to do things.\n\nMy first co-op at Kettering. My supervisor was moving to another department and wanted me to look through 15 years of files she had for important papers. I told her that\u2019s not my job description, and informed her supervisor of why I would not be doing what asked. A lot of people will try to push co-ops around because 1. They know some don\u2019t know and better or 2. Because we are a co-op.\n\nAs for the not getting credit, reach out to your co-op advisor and have a discussion about what happened. The co-op department really does care (in my experience) they may be able to help you out. And they would love to know the bad experience you had because they will reach out to the company (if you don\u2019t mind) and inform the HR contact they have of your supervisors conduct.",

            "comment": "This didn\u2019t happen directly to me but when I first started at my co-op, my division had hired a new boss soon after. This new boss held an introduction meeting where we all introduced ourselves and our roles and just talked a little. Well, I didn\u2019t know about what happened for a while later, but apparently my mentor had almost been fired after the meeting by the new boss because he was giving off the wrong \u201cvibes.\u201d However, my mentor ended up not getting fired because this new boss quit a week after he was hired anyways. Moral of the story, your boss isn\u2019t always going to be a great person and sometimes things happen for a reason. While you may not have gotten credit for the co-op, it didn\u2019t sound like a very fulfilling role to begin with. I\u2019d reach out to your advisors and just move on.",

Don't listen to someone telling you to drop out, especially not someone who clearly hates their job and is taking it out on you. This is a time in your life where you are full of potential and opportunity, you can go out and find a new job, I doubt she can. Find a co-op that is forgiving and works for you. Over my last term, I was thrust into a critical position due to the pandemic, and though I did well, I made a very costly mistake. The conversation my boss and I had about it lasted no more than a few minutes and he essentially told me everyone makes mistakes and as long as I learn from it there is no problem.  It's easy to get caught up in what others say about you but keep chugging and be confident in yourself. You got this.",

Companies just looking for cheap labor without providing an experience in any way relevant to your future career. Don't beat yourself up on this. I doubt your ability to cut tubes is any indication of how well you will do in whatever field it it is you are trying to go in to.",

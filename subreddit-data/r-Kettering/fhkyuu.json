The only thing we have heard regarding the topic was the email that only said we have prepared online classes in case. There was no update on what the board has been discussing or what they are looking to do. So while I understand you being upset about students complaining, if I were you, I would be more upset at the actual issue which is the university's glaring lack of ability to properly communicate with it's own community.",

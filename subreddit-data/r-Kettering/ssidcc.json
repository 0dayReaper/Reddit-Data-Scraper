    "postText": "I had him for Math 102-X. He was an amazing prof and human being. Professor Masha truly cared about every student that he taught and did his best to help everyone succeed. If anyone displayed what passion for teaching was, it was definitely Prof Masha. My thoughts go out to his friends, family, and students.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone would like to leave their thoughts and prayers regarding this tragedy, please comment on this post.",

But I knew him through working together on the CETL Advisory Board, and from numerous lunchtime discussions at various teaching events.  \n\nIt didn't take long to realize that Prof. Masha was a special soul.  His passion for students was obvious in the ways he talked about teaching.  It was clear that he was well suited to his role as a 101/102(-X) instructor --- and that he relished the role.\n\nI will miss him, too.",

No slacking in his class, he made a point of knowing everyone's names so that he could call you out if you weren't doing your best. But not in a mean professor kind of way, more of a \"I care about each of you and your success individually\" kind of way. I don't know if I'd of gotten through calc 2 without him.  \n\nI spent many hours in his office to talk about things. When I was stressed about failing classes, or felt like I wasn't good enough for Kettering, he always had the things to say to keep me on the right track and make me feel more confident about myself. He's one of two professors I can think of that made me not drop out of the university within my first couple of years. Again, I'm a senior now, so I'm thankful for that. \n\nHe was a great professor, and an even better person. He loved teaching, but I think he loved the connections he built with students over everything else. I'll really miss him.",

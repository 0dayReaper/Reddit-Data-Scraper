    "postText": "I've been hearing a lot of rumors about some colleges \"tracking\" their students' location and requiring that they stay on campus and perform daily health checks. I know there was a rumor that Oakland was going to do something like this, but they back tracked and aren't anymore, and the newest rumor I've read about is about Albion college making students stay on campus for the entire term. I didn't do much reading into either of these stories so feel free to fact check any of this (wanna make this a decent discussion).\n\nIF Kettering tried to enact a policy similar to this, how would the student body react? How many of us would drop out and go somewhere else? Would we be totally cool with it?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/icy6z1)",

Which means that it would be logistically possible for Albion to consider requiring students to stay completely within the campus \"bubble\".    (I take no position on whether or not that would be a good thing.)\n\nKettering's campus of 7(?) buildings simply isn't designed for that sort of self-contained activity.    There's no gateways to campus that could be shut to keep people in (or out) of the campus area.   There's not enough retail within the bubble to make self-containment possible.\n\nSo I don't think that this sort of hypothetical question would ever be considered, because it's not logistically possible.   \n\nAgain, I have no official information, and I speak on behalf of no-one.",

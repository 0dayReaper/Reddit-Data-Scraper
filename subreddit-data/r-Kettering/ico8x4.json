I'm stuck with either Advanced Automotive Power Systems (441) or Intro to Automotive Powertrains (444). I don't know who's teaching them yet. \n\nAny reviews on either would be helpful (/ T\\^T)/",

I would recommend you take the intro class because 441 relies on you having taken 444 beforehand. Loved the class though, I had professor Davis and he one of the best professors I've had at kettering so far. He helped me through the basics that I didn't have from 444 and it was a fun and interesting class. Hope this helps",

            "comment": "I took both during my time at Kettering. I value Powertrain more than power systems especially if you're considering an Automotive job. I use what I learned in this class to this day. The power systems course, at least when I was attending (2016) was heavily dependent on combustion. There are very few openings for IC engine based roles in the market today. I'd rather go for the Hybrid class if you have the opportunity (445 I think. I took the 645 as I was getting a master's degree).",

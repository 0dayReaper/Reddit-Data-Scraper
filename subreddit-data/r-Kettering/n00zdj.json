Disney would like a word.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Is yellow sweater girl clipping through her chair? If so, how does a 2D image clip through another image it has been superimposed over?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Is the girl standing by the wall-es meant to be standing directly in front of the viewer? That is the only way one would get that perspective from the street... is she even standing within the bounds of the room? Is this inside or outside? Why is the only POC in the image so conspicuous? Did they get to the final step, realize they had only put white people in the picture, then shoehorn her in last minute?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Why is the text on the blackboard in the back so bright? Does this take place in a future where we have discovered and popularized luminescent chalk?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Why is there a 3d-rendered wireframe model of a spaceship on the blackboard on the far left? Who had the time to draw that, including all the text, and for what purpose?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Why are there blackboards here in the first place? We collectively agreed, as a society, to stop using those in 2005. Also, the ones that were here were green.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Is this implying that we, the students, built all these robots? We do not have the tools nor any good reason to create any one of those machines.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The wall-es on the right, the tin men in the middle of the picture, and the futuristic white robots on the left, all co-existing in the same place on the same timeline built by the same body of students is a glaring continuity error.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Assuming this takes place so far, far off in a hypothetical future (where we don't all die from climate change related causes) that maybe students could have built every one of those robots in a single term- why would there be a poster on the wall for a movie from 2005?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Why are the wall-es so rusty? Even if they weren't freshly built, were they exposed to the same elements as the wall-es in the wall-e movie? Is this a post-post-apocalyptic utopian future set long after the Axiom returned to earth? Wouldn't that make the wall-es even more rusty? ntm this timeline of events would make the Robots poster even more confusing...!&lt;\n\nIf you're gonna take the concept of 'robots' and run with it without looking at what 'robots' actually look like in a college setting, the least you could do is make it make sense. That's all I'm sayin.",

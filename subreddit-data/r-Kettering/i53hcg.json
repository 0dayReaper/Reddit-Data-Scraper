IMO it makes more sense for this A section term to have pass/fail than when we had it in the winter... especially because a good number of students are 100% virtual just like B section was, who got pass/fail because they were virtual.",

Whether it be bad cameras, intermittent audio loss or just not being able to get questions answered because nobody's checking the chat, these hybrids are pretty bad in my experience.",

That last grade is really significant for some students\n\nLuckily none of those profs were mine, but I'm glad the option was available for those who needed it.",

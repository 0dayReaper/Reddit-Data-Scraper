    "postText": "This email is unhinged. This is the most dangerous time in our nations history and this boomer is threatening us to come back or get a doctors note. I \u201cstrongly encourage\u201d him to resign as he \u201cstrongly encourages\u201d me to risk my life so I can listen to his cut-rate professors and pay top dollar. This is an attempt to blame the state when the mandate is inevitably extended. I chose this school because it was about excellence, not about doing the absolute bare minimum required by law. This virus has exposed this administration as a cash grabbing, student-life gambling, student-data mishandling bumbling mess.",

            "comment": "The email didn\u2019t say that a doctors note was required. Just that if you are healthy, and you don\u2019t have any \u201cspecific health exceptions\u201d then you are \u201cencouraged\u201d to attend \u201call in person lectures that are available\u201d to you. So, while we will need to provide information about our health, you can still choose to not attend in person classes. \n\nThat said, when in person lecture is available, it\u2019s hard to avoid issues that come with having a classroom with both online and in person students. And it almost sets an expectation that you \u201cshould\u201d be attending in person, and not online. This, with the combination of how big of a shitstorm the rollout of the vaccine could be, is not a recipe for success imo. We aren\u2019t out of the woods yet, and McMahan is taking a risk by doing this.",

Having to drive back and forth would result in me being late and missing class. I would love to go back in person, but I was paying rent for a house to just sit and watch videos all day. I couldve sat at home for free and done that. Is this term really going to be any different? I dont feel like paying rent just to have 1 out of my 5 classes in person, that is just stupid.",

One of my classes was offering in person lectures, but it was right after my 8am which was fully virtual. \n\nSo I\u2019d have to either skip the end of my 8am or keep my headphones in while I walked to Kettering just to catch that lecture lmao.",

The only people dying on mass from covid are people above the age of 70-80 who are already facing health issues. If you're worried about people in your home, they are still offering online options.",

We are months away from mass vaccination, but we can\u2019t continue what we\u2019ve been doing why? Because you have cabin fever? Because McMahon will be forced out by the board if he loses that room and board fee? I just don\u2019t see how making a small sacrifice that can help eradicate the menace that is COVID is that big of an issue for some. People will get sick if we come back. I don\u2019t know if they will die, and neither do you. We can play \u201cwhere to draw the line on when mass death should be dealt with\u201d but instead we could just see through the cash grab and seek a solution to keep our community safe.",

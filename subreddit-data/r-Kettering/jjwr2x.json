    "postText": "I finished my last semester at Kettering as an ME this past summer. But I still need to finish my thesis and take an elective class (I\u2019m taking it out). Will this get in the way of getting a full time job? I am worried that I will have to wait to get a job. Any advice helps.\n\n**I do not need to be in contact with my previous employer to finish my thesis.",

            "comment": "As others have said --- much will depend on your employer.\n\nDefinitely be up-front during your application process about the fact that you're not done yet; misrepresenting yourself to a company as having a degree and then not being able to produce a diploma or a certified transcript puts you in a bad spot.    Some employers will be flexible and make you a probationary hire for a limited period until you finish and can provide that you've finished; others will require that you be finished before you can be hired.\n\nWhen you say that you still need to \"finish your thesis\" --- does that involve further contact with your prior employer?   That could be a sticky point with some prospective employers, because then you're sort-of working for two employers at the same time (which might be competitors).\n\nSo ... yeah, it could be an issue, and it could be fine.   Be honest about it, and get your thesis done so that it's not an issue :).",

            "comment": "Depends on where you are going job wise and how far along you are with your thesis. I would just communicate that you have to finish up your undergrad thesis to the employers you are applying to.\n\nNow if you aren't far on your thesis at all, working full time and trying to finish it is probably not going to be a fun time, especially if you get sucked into doing overtime at your job. \n\nI don't have much else to add because I'm a Senior 3 scrambling to get my thesis done that I started in the summer but if I was in your situation, talking to your perspective employers is what I would do.",

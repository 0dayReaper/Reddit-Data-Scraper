So I believe (again this is what I believe to have happened based off of evidence) is that someone drank too much and then kinda freaked out. The delts were extremely upset about the possibility of someone ruffied a guest at their house and asked the person to get the drug test to confirm if it happened so they could try to hunt the asshole down. This is where things get weird. They refused to do a drug test while at the hospital despite one almost always being administered first thing when you check into the hospital for something like that. There may have been a drug test done but they refused to share the results. This left the delts in an odd limbo where they were ready to hunt the supposed ruffier down to the ends of the earth if it was true, but seeing how odd the situation was it would be really bad if they denied it or accused the person of making a false claim. In the end nothing came of it but it was a stressful week for the delts trying to figure out what to do about it.",

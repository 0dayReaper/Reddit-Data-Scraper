Y'all were generous with your teaching tips and advice.\n\nThe term is just about over, of course, and ... y'know, I think things went okay.   So I return here to say \"thank you\" for your help.   I still have stuff to learn (as do we all), but I know that things went better with your advice than without it.\n\nWe now return you to your regularly scheduled meme posts.",

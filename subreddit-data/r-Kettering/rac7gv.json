Please answer bearing in mind that the ID does much more than allow access two the few entry points on campus but allows access to the library, recreation centre, wellness centre, special labs, etc. \n\nIs the only thing to do to pay the $10 for a replacement? Is there a temp ID thing you can have set up at the campus safety place or anything?",

They set up the fee because people were asking for way too many replacements. It never hurts to express your issue to the party that could potentially resolve it. Worst case is that you still are required to pay the 10 dollars but you'd be doing that in this situation eventually anyways.\n\nLike you said, the ID does way more than just open doors so idk how feasible it would be as a long term solution to just rely on a friend or an open door",

Unfortunately, power strips aren't enough of a solution in some rooms, particularly in the AB, where there aren't even enough outlets on the walls to support power strips.\n\nI heard a rumor that one solution being contemplated is to equip classrooms with power-pack charging stations.   The idea would be that you could grab a power pack when you walk into the room, plug your laptop into it during class, then return the pack to the charging station when you leave.   But the idea is still in the discussion stages.\n\nNonetheless ... I absolutely agree that classroom power is a problem, and y'all ought to complain about it every chance you get.",

I do not live in the state hence I cannot come to class to take this exam. I emailed him and he said if I want to take it I need to come to the school. I have emailed the provost and the ASC in the past about him and the way he holds exams. They were very little help for this issue. I am not sure what I am supposed to do about this.",

On the one hand, it sounds like an optional make-up, which unfortunately disrupts a lot of your power. On the other hand, given the current circumstances, I'm almost certain he can't require you to come to campus, reasons for which obviously exceed you being out of state. \n\nAs others have stated, the provost is probably your best option. If they don't get back to you in time, there's at least no harm in trying. The best thing you can do right now is create a paper trail. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "With the ongoing Novel Corona-virus pandemic making face-to-face courses impractical, Kettering University was one of the earliest academic institutions to attempt to implement a hybrid solution. While I have much respect for Kettering University trying to institute something better than online classes, it's obvious to us all that they are not an adequate replacement for a variety of reasons. While this may seem inconsequential, it has greater implications than some may think particularly to our tuition costs.\n\nKettering University offers an array of Masters programs ranging from  [MBA](https://online.kettering.edu/programs/masters/masters-business-administration-online)  to [Electrical and Computing Engineering - Advanced Mobility Focus](https://online.kettering.edu/programs/masters/electrical-computer-engineering-masters-online) all of which being offered as a set of online courses. While I myself have not been enrolled in one of their online masters programs, I would assume this is how they were able to transition from in-person classes to online classes so rapidly during the initial onset of the pandemic by expanding their masters online infrastructure to the greater student body. The cost per credit hour of the online master's degree program is on average about $910 (KU online masters programs are 40 credits dispersed over 18-24 months). According to Kettering University's [Undergraduate Costs to Attend](https://www.kettering.edu/admissions/tuition-affordability/undergraduate-costs-attend) page on their website, the cost per credit hour is $1480 for a part time student (Undergrad part-time is the closest comparison to masters). From this we can extrapolate that Kettering University values their online classes around 40% less than standard in-person classes. \n\nNow that we have established Kettering University has set a precedent on the reduced values of their online courses, we can now discuss the significance of the pass/fail option offered to students during the pandemic. With the hybrid option of classes being for the first time last semester, it is apparent to all who attended that they were not an adequate replacement for in-person classes as they were nearly all completely online towards the end of the term (not to mention professors that didn't even offer in-person classes). In the previous term of completely online courses, they maintained the cost of tuition while still offering a Pass/Fail option. While this was still egregious, the Pass/Fail option made it somewhat palatable. By maintaining tuition and not allowing for a Pass/Fail option the school is telling us that they think they have come up with a solution of EQUAL VALUE to courses offered prior to the pandemic. \n\nI am truly appalled by this as Kettering University must think that we are smooth-brained Neanderthals to let this one slide under our noses. It isn't even about GPA, it's about how Kettering University is trying to pass sneakers it found in the bottom of a dumpster as Yeezy's and charging us full price them. Kettering University is one of the few institutions that actually offers a decent value proposition when compared to other universities in the mid-west. With many students losing their Co-ops along with overpriced online classes it's really starting to feel like a scam more so than any other university offering. \n\nThe importance of Pass/Fail is that at the very least it is an admission by the school that the courses they are offering are inferior (even by the slightest margin) to the ones they have offered in the past. Even though the pricing was still absurd for online classes, at the very least Pass/Fail made it slightly more reasonable. From an employment standpoint, the Pass/Fail option helps the student body because it gives people a chance to get a new Co-op by offering a bit of a GPA cushion along with preventing students from losing their Co-op due to a lower gpa during the pandemic.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk",

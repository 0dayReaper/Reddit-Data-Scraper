Not certain if they are under the wellfleet insurance, but if you have the chance to get an IHA doctor, they are super organized and professionally courteous.  My PCP is based out of Plymouth, buy IHA has a large medical complex in Ypsilanti, and other satellite offices throughout Washtenaw county.  I highly recommend them.\n\nIn Ann Arbor, I would avoid Parters In Internal Medicine (PIIM) at all costs.",

    "postText": "This school has shown us in the past few weeks that their interests are primarily in generating the most revenue possible, much to the detriment of the general population. In a international emergency, where many of us have lost our Co-ops, we are being charged thousands of dollars for a skeleton of our normal semester. We should not be used as a cash cow for McMahnn and the board of directors, to put up a building that most of us will never even use.\n\nThe only way kettering will hear our voice is if we speak with our wallets. \n\nSTUDENT TUITION STRIKE UNTIL THE SCHOOL RECOGNIZES THEY ARE COMMITTING EXTORTION ON STUDENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.\n\n-lower tuition costs\n\n-cut university spending to only for faculty salary and essential expenses for students living on campus\n\n-provide universal student testing for COVID-19",

            "comment": "Agreed that this whole thing is sus. A lot of this email is horribly written and inconsistent with my (limited) research, but it is correct that a lot of the outrage is being aimed at things that Honorlock does not do. Yes, that's what it initially sounded like they did, but any research into it will tell you otherwise. They have alternative methods of tracking your browser history other than monitoring ALL of your network traffic.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this still pisses me off, but I'd prefer that we focus on the problems that exist so administration will take us seriously.\n\n[https://distance.fsu.edu/honorlock-security-and-privacy-faq](https://distance.fsu.edu/honorlock-security-and-privacy-faq)\n\n## Does the Honorlock browser application have the ability to detect and monitor other computing devices connected to the local/home network used during a student\u2019s proctoring session?\n\n&gt;Honorlock does not employ any technologies to allow detection of secondary devices connected to a student\u2019s local/home network used during the proctoring session. No agents or applications are downloaded to these secondary devices to initiate any type of surveillance activities. Other users connected to the local/home network during a student\u2019s Honorlock session can process personal or confidential information concurrently without fear of the student\u2019s Honorlock session monitoring or eavesdropping on secondary device activities. In addition, the application does not have the capability of intercepting local/home network communications from devices connected during the student\u2019s session.\n\n## Does Honorlock have the capability to monitor the use of my smartphone during an examination session?\n\n&gt;Students using their smartphones to search online resources for test questions should note Honorlock utilizes a manual technology to detect academic integrity issues. Specifically, Honorlock hosts websites with seeded test questions that, when accessed druing an examination session, sets off an action on the phone. This action is picked up during the student\u2019s session and alerts instructors and FSU proctors to review for academic integrity issues. Honorlock does not initiate any technologies to eavesdrop on the student\u2019s smartphone activity either during or after an examination session. It is important for students to understand they are not authorized to use their phones during an Honorlock proctored examination.\n\n[In simple terms,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/ja165f/honorlock_lawsuit_violations/g8nvyz6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Honorlock doesn\u2019t actively monitor your web traffic. You can pull their patents but what it does is take the test questions and generate fake answer websites that are search optimised for google so if you paste the question into google you might land on one of those sites. The site then logs your IP and see if it matches an IP of someone currently taking a test. If it does match, then it flags you for cheating on that question. Their patent is public record and they hold one for this process and computer program, it\u2019s pretty neat and they have some good visuals if you want more info/how to understand it better.\n\nIf I'm understanding correctly, and I'm not advocating for this but just as a hypothetical; if you happen to have a VPN on your phone and/or your computer, as long as they aren't set to the same IP, it would entirely circumvent this feature. But then you still have the camera and microphone and facial detection device monitoring and browser history and whole host of privacy issues to deal with so... still shitty spyware.",

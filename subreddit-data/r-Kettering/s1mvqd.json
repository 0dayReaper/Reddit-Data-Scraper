I noticed a lot of my friends are also having to do this and im taking a class out now. I will have to take all the classes out I can and probably take some opposite section classes during work term to pick up the slack. Not looking for advice or anything just wondering if anyone relates.",

With this, I'm actually graduating in 3 years, rather than 3.5 expected pre-pandemic, still a total of 7 semesters though. \n\nI havent failed any classes since being online (yet, knock on wood), and I havent ran into any major issues when scheduling classes that would result in me staying an extra term or too.",

For a school that the president makes 700k per year they should have money to give to struggling students things like this are what made me not want to go here initially greedy administrators who dont care about students. Instead of worrying about that new building they should reallocate money to help students during this crisis. The learning commons wont do anything if students can pay tuition.",

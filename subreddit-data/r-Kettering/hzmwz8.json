    "postText": "Today Joe Salacuse doubled down on his in person tests. He even went so far as to say the he and his wife would deliver in person tests to fraternities and sororities. Today in class, he went on a long rant about how no one was coming to class. He claimed that coming to class was \"the patriotic thing to do.\" He singled certain people out in class, and told us that we were trying to \"cheat the system.\" \n\nPeople from my class yesterday emailed the provost and the ASC. Today my plan is to clip his lecture and send it to the dean and the head of the math department. Any help with this situation would be appriciated!",

Doesn\u2019t surprise he\u2019s not considering what he was like when I had him and that was in 2014. Don\u2019t back down. Hold the school to their promises and \u201cplaybook\u201d. If they don\u2019t well... I\u2019m sure the news station downtown would love to hear about it.",

No idea how true any of this is, still just rumors after all.\n\nT-pain clip is a clip on snapchat (?) where T-pain specifically claims that KU never hired him in the first place for anything.",

The plan was to take them to a shooting range to test them out, but the school wasn't happy about that. Idk if it was the sole reason he got fired, but it certainly didn't help lol.\n\nFor the T-pain thing, wow that's hilarious. I remember driving up to go to the concert only to find out it was cancelled",

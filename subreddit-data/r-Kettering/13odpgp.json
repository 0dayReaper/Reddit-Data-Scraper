At least I think they were last time I checked\n\nIf it\u2019s still $10, then if you do the math you\u2019re actually spending more money then if you just buy it without the meal plan (using 11 weeks)\n\nThe only plan that you actually get more value out of are the \u201cflexible dining plans\u201d\n\nOf course it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they raised the price of a meal there now. And if they did, the price would need to be $11.21 to just break even with the cost of plan A op. 1 (assuming you also spend all of your flexible dining dollars). And option 2 is an even bigger scam, $12.50 per meal to break even\n\nI won\u2019t even bother doing the math for the commute meal plan because it\u2019s probably even worse\n\nTd;lr don\u2019t buy the meal plan unless you need to (so basically if you aren\u2019t a freshman don\u2019t buy it)",

    "postText": "Hi guys! I need your help!\n\nI'm taking a class this term that's requiring us to put out a survey about how usable some of the Kettering web pages are. It's only five questions, doesn't require anything in depth, just looking for some thoughts. \n\nAll you have to do is check out this \"IT Help Sheets\" web page: [HERE!](https://my.kettering.edu/page/information-technology-help-sheets-and-videos-z)\n\nAnd then after you look at it, fill out this survey: [HERE!](https://forms.gle/MURZ4qu9C9vuBErj8)\n\nFYI, it requires you to sign in because the survey is only accepting responses from people from Kettering... but the survey isn't collecting emails for it's responses, nor are we keeping track of who said what. We just need some responses for analysis on what's the collectives opinion on the web page. \n\nThanks so much for helping out!",

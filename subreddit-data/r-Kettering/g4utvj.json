            "comment": "To any incoming Summer students trying to decide whether to go to Thompson Hall or not: while I personally doubt they are going to be able to open the dorms by July, if you get the opportunity, you should do it. \n\nDorm life is where most people meet their college friends. Living in the dorms makes it convenient to meet for study groups &amp; group projects. Student Life puts on decent events &amp; programs, and being on campus makes it easy to participate in clubs or rush events. \n\nWhile Thompson Hall is a bit dated, getting a dorm room to yourself as a Freshman is awesome. Just leave your door open when you're in your room and you're sure to make lots of friends.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to do at least one term in Thompson Hall. After you have done one term and made a bunch of friends, you can either rent a house across the street with your friends or stay at a fraternity house - that way you'll get 90% of the benefits of living \"on campus\" for much cheaper.",

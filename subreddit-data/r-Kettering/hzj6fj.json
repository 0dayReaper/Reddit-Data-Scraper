If there is close contact with the initial index case that then spreads this is how we define an outbreak.-- *Doctor* Khaldun    \n\n\nObviously this is paraphrased but in relation to Kettering's current situation is sigma chi test positive (the index case) and alpha phi test positive (close contact case) Kettering by definition would have an outbreak.",

But also, just because we're a private school doesn't mean the administration doesn't have to listen to an laws that are or may be put in place",

There's hundreds of new cases in MI every day, with Flint being [not too far from a big epicenter of the MI outbreak (Oakland &amp; Wayne County)](https://mlive.carto.com/u/levinscott/viz/6b217c29-8db7-4daa-9cfb-e07ba6291db2/public_map). However, the discourse that has spawned from this; about Greek life, online classes, and tuition; may possibly be considered newsworthy to very local news organizations. \n\nThere was bound be one on our campus sooner or later. Testing was not mandatory and in fact very limited in our return to campus. There were a lot of guidelines given to protect students in the AB, but there was very little instruction on how to reasonably conduct yourself when you leave. There's been a lot of traveling going on, students coming and going from campus and visiting their family/friends. Arguably at the same rate that they did pre-pandemic.",

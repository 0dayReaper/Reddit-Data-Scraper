I just sent an email to my Co-op manager (LL3+ at one of the big 3) letting him know that I will be forced to hand over company data to HonorLock if I want to take classes this term. My network is full of sensitive company data such as prototype software, company top secret business strategy, and other items that require a high level of security. HonorLock is now the weak point in my network infrastructure and yours as well. Notify your perspective Co-ops about this immediately or you could be held personally responsible for company data leaks.",

Nearly all companies with employees working from home are using a vpn to access company files. HonorLock is able to intercept this data by forcing the user to give HonorLock access to everything on the computer and the network. Honorlock explicitly states that they are monitoring all devices on a network. Even if you have a separate device for work they are still able to see the corporate data.",

HonorLock would have no way to interpret encrypted data across a network and you would be an idiot to install this on a company laptop. I think this was an attempt to brag about having \"top secret\" data from a super cool coop job",

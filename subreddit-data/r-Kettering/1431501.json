    "postText": "I went to the library for the reopening and the really old black haired lady (head/dean of the library) told me that it won\u2019t be open after finals.  She was rude as hell and was straight happy with herself to be telling me our  library is gone for good.  It was so clear she\u2019s the one that made the decision to close it now. And really what kind of library dean is anti library?  She couldn\u2019t hide her excitement.  She even tried telling me some bs about not having staff. They do. We all see them in the LC and used to see them (looking a lot happier) back in the library.  Put the librarians back in the library already!!!  This is insane!! What university doesn\u2019t have a functioning library?\n\nIt\u2019s time we take this to the news channels and Flint journal. ABC NBC FOX \u2026all of the above.   Everyone should know how messed up this is.\n\nWhat do we have to do to get our library back, McMahan?",

            "comment": "The problem with closing the library and relying on the LC as the main hangout and social location is that it spreads out the students and doesn't allow interaction between groups as much. Nor are you likely to see people at all tbh. In the library you'd be in an environment to allow students to get to know each other better. Additionally existence of the LC has jeopardized the popularity of the pool and its use.\n\nThe pool used to be where everyone hungout in Greek Life and for a freshman it was inviting and allowed people to interact with those orgs. Now it's significantly harder since freshman who are nervous will hide in their dorms and in the deep corners of the LC away from everyone.\n\nKettering being Kettering, incoming freshmen need the slight push to try new things and if they're able to do that we're going to end up with an entirely socially awkward hide away dead campus full of lobby rats. Not that everyone here isn't already socially awkward and weird.",

The main thing I ever used the library for was printing papers, which can be done in the LC and can be sent over the online app instead of logging into the library computers. The other thing was people having a place to chill and do homework without taking up a D space, which also the LC has. Lastly if you want to check out a physical book I can see an argument but for most classes now post Covid, most textbooks are given as pdfs from professors or you can just find them online or expense it out from the online library if it's not available. I just wish they'd do something with the old library space like make it into classrooms, small sitting areas, D spaces, food place, etc...",

I dont think the library was every really used as a place to get books. Maybe this is a Gen Z brain take but if I ever need to look something up, it's way more convenient to use the internet than check through the library. To me, the library was more of a place to hang out between classes, which the LC does, but better.\n\nI do agree it's a waste of space, and we might as well have it open since the space isn't being used for anything else at the moment. But I still don't understand why it's a big deal. It sounds like you have a bigger issue with staff over how the actual library is being handled.",

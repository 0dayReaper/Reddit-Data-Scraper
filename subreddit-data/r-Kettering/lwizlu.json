    "postText": "Got a call today from someone from Magna Electronics, asking if I needed a co-op. \n\nSounds like they have different projects depending on which location/person you're assigned to... she wasn't specific, said she'd get back with me in the next couple of days with details on what I'd be doing.  \n\nThe location she said was in Holly, MI, and it sounds something like a technical project related to manufacturing? \n\nJust curious if anyone has any experiences with their company :]",

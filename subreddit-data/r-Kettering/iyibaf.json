Pay attention, take notes and do the homework early so you have time to ask questions. \n\nAll the complaints you've heard are probably more directed at her tests. I've only had her for matrix, and she was amazing at teaching it, but her tests had too short of a time limit for me to complete all of the questions, and she expects perfection on each one. You'll pass as long as you put in effort, but don't slack on notes and homework because some parts are easy. Even if you know how to do the work, you need to be good enough at it to do it in the limited time frame of the tests.",

So please, PLEASE, practice these problems to make sure that you can do them quickly, or you WILL get screwed. Additionally, do your Matlab projects sooner rather than later. I had no idea what I was doing for most of the programs, so those aren't helping my grade right now either. For some people they might be easy, but any kind of programming is not my cup of tea. She likely would have been really helpful had I asked her questions about my programs before they were due. Best of luck!!",

She is a good professor gives clear notes and knows her content very well. Her test are very challenging ( algebra heavy) and it is challenging material in general. She does curve at the end based on improvements from test to test. If you improve throughout the term and ask her when you need help you will do fine. This was by far one of the most beneficial classes I took at Kettering.",

She didn't make it clear to our class they you could even be in groups so I did the first 2 by myself which sucked.\nThey are relatively straightforward but they are time-consuming if you don't know the stuff going into it (you're not expected to I don't think) since most of it is just telling you to figure out how to do stuff on your own.\n\nAlso the class starts off pretty easy, right up until the deadline for dropping it iirc, lol. But it gets much more complex as it goes on",

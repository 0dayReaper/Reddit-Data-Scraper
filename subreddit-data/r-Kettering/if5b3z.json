One thing to keep in mind Plymouth/Canton is kinda pricey, when it comes to rent.\n\nYou could try Lodging by the Month in Plymouth, although it might be pricey https://www.lodgingbythemonth.com/\n\nIn the past, there have been rooms available to rent via AirBNB, idk if that is still an option.\n\nI know a realtor in the area who rents to Kettering students, you can see if she has any openings in her houses. You can find her contact info here: https://www.realtor.com/realestateagents/anu-george_plymouth_mi_1165993_892584405\n\nGood luck with your search!",

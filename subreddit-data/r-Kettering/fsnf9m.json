    "postText": "I decided I'm going to take classes during spring term since I can't work anyway and I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for Automotive Specialty elective.\n\nI'm thinking about Mech 442 (Chassis Systems) or Mech 444 (Intro to Automotive Powertrains) or Mech 441 (Advanced Automotive Power Systems). I need to pick two of them.\n\nChassis Systems would be relevant to my co-op and suspension and steering systems would be interesting, Automotive Powertrains would be interesting because it'd be cool to learn about gear ratios and manual transmissions etc, and Advance Power Systems seems appealing because I'd be interested in learning more about hybrid powertrains... \n\nThanks for your help and I hope everyone is doing well.",

            "comment": "The two automotive specialty classes I would recommend are vehicle Dynamics with Dr. Bastiaan and Hybrids with Dr. Hoff.  I know these aren\u2019t the what you listed but Hybrids will teach you all and more then intro to powertrains and Hoff is a far better teacher then Davis plus you learn a lot of Matlab.",

            "comment": "I just took powertrains so I'll give you my input on that class. It is very informative, you learn a lot of stuff you probably wouldn't have in any other class at the school. But the homework is very time intensive and the prof (Greg Davis) treats the class like it's a powertrains division at a company. The homework requires multiples hours of work a day for a week so if your ok with that then go for it. Exams are open book and as long as you understand the homework you'll be ok. The labs are equally as time intensive but you have a to work in. I took the class because a friend who has an automotive specialty recommended it to me because I wanted the most information about automotive engineering in one class and this class definitely delivers. Like I said, this class is very valuable and if you want to learn more about powertrains take it. Just know what you're getting yourself into.\nAlso it helps if you're decent at excel.",

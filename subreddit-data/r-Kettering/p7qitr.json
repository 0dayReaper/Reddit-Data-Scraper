    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm going to be joining Kettering as a graduate student next year and I need some help regarding class schedules and internships. How many classes do grad students usually take and is there an expected minimum number of classes? For internships, how do you get them and how has it been balancing work and school with internships? Also do those internships usually translate to jobs after college?",

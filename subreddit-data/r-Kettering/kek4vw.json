    "postText": "I, on behalf of myself and a small group of students that I am close with, wrote an email to resident life regarding the policy that all first year students are being required to stay in Thompson Hall. We requested exceptions to be made.\n\nEveryone I was writing on behalf of have already made living plans based on the fact assumption that as the pandemic worsened, the school would extend it policy of letting students choose weather to live in the dorms or not. All of our plans were made months in advance.\n\nThe email I received in response was not only less than we had all hoped for but almost left me with a sense that the only thing that they cared to talk about from my email was to correct me on one of the more insignificant points of my argument. To me personally, it does not matter if there was a full blown outbreak in the  dorms or not, any cases at all within the dorms creates an environment that can deteriorate quickly into an outbreak if not caught quick enough and handled properly.\n\n**I will post my email and their response below for anyone who is interested to read for themselves.**\n\nIn addition, I plan on continuing to fight this until it is absolutely certain that the school does not care and there is nothing more I can do. We will all also be submitting personal requests for exemptions to be made as well as contacting more officials. I am not giving up yet! This policy is not appropriate for the world we are living in right now, it is not only dangerous but reckless too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is my email:**\n\n&gt;**\"**Dear Resident Life:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I  am writing to you today on behalf of myself and a small group of my fellow students who feel similarly about the upcoming term. We seek to appeal your decision that first year students have to live in the dorms, and are asking to be exempt from that policy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In making this request, my fellow students and I would cite several factors: the high price of a higher education and associated costs; the downturn in the economy as a whole; the dangers of Covid-19 pandemic;  and the last-minute timing of the news that we will be required to live in Thompson Hall once again.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With the pandemic that we currently find ourselves caught in, the economy is struggling and families are struggling to make ends meet. For those who are relying on family support to help put us through college -- which I can say with reasonable confidence is most students -- every penny counts.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As students at Kettering we all benefit from our locked in tuition rates and some of us have been lucky enough to be awarded grants and scholarships along with financial aid to suit. Yet with the cost of tuition upwards of $50,000 a year, many of us still are paying a considerable amount. One of us pays nearly $30,000 a year to attend Kettering. On top of that we all have to pay for room and board.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All of us lived in the dorms for the first term and we all agree that it is in our best interest to try to save money wherever possible. A large portion of that savings can be found in finding alternative housing outside of Thompson Hall.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All of the students that I am representing in this email have already found and secured housing for this upcoming term. There is now less than a month left until the winter term begins and this notice from the university comes at the last minute. In addition, with the numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths at an all time high not only nationally and worldwide but also in Genesee County, it would seem safer for us to not to live in a congregant setting like a dorm. Not to mention that B-section just recently had a Covid-19 outbreak within Thompson Hall.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the last two consecutive terms, students were given the choice of whether to live on or off campus, and the majority of the student body assumed that this coming term would follow suit with that precedent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The email that was sent out to the whole student body on December 11th noted that the first rounds of the Covid-19 vaccine are going to soon begin being distributed.  But my fellow students and I are at the back of the line. The vaccine is first going to be distributed to healthcare workers, essential workers, the elderly and those with preexisting conditions (in that order specifically), and then the rest of us will begin to be able to get vaccinated. According to The New York Times and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the rest of us adults with the youngest most likely at the end of the line should begin receiving the vaccine at the absolute earliest in April. But the more realistic expectation is that the majority of otherwise healthy adults will begin to receive the vaccine at least as late as May or June. If you are being optimistic and willing to go with the early date of April rollouts, that still leaves us having gone the entirety of the winter term, likely without any of the student body and most of the staff having been vaccinated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are all reasonable people and understand the importance of getting that living-on-campus experience but we find it not only unreasonable but also unnecessarily dangerous to be forced to live on campus where our safety of keeping clean and Covid-free is put into the hands of someone other than ourselves. All it takes is one person to get Covid-19 and touch the water fountain and then the whole floor has it. Living off campus leaves us in control of the surfaces we touch and who comes within a close proximity of us, not to mention that not living with dozens of other students helps to limit the risk of spreading the virus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As I am speaking for my fellow students, I can confidently say that we would not only feel safer but *be safer* if we were permitted to live off campus for the duration of the winter term.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for your time and consideration**\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is their response:**\n\n&gt;**\"** Hello,   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for sharing, (my name). Please send your questions, comments, and concerns regarding the University's decision to honor the requirement that all first-year students reside on campus to [welcomebackbulldogs@kettering.edu](mailto:welcomebackbulldogs@kettering.edu). It's important to fact check prior to sending anything out -- e.g. Apart from isolated cases, TH has not experienced an outbreak.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Students can submit a waiver request in their[ housing portal. ](http://myhousing.kettering.edu/) The requests will be reviewed and a decision will be sent directly to the student via email. Please note: The eligible options are:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u00b7 21 years of age or older by the end of the term  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u00b7 Married  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u00b7 Have child(ren) residing with me in my home for whom I have legal custody or guardianship  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u00b7 Prior two (2) terms in a residence hall (at a college/university)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Should you not meet these requirements, and you still believe a special exemption is needed: Email reslife@ku a written explanation, and attach any supporting documents, so that we can forward it for review. It is recommended that you send individual requests, as they will be reviewed on a case by case basis.Please note: This does not guarantee approval.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- ResLife**\"**",

I lived in the dorms when things were normal and winter term is lonely in the dorms even without a pandemic. (Everyone just goes home on the weekends or lives at a frat house)",

Reslife doesn't make these kinds of rules, they just enforce them.\n\nHowever, (and please trust that I mean this in the most constructive way possible. I know I'm going to be downvoted to hell for telling you this when you didn't ask for a peer review.), my inner grammar nazi is strongly urging me to suggest to you that it might be a good idea to do a once-over for general flow and readability if you haven't already sent something out. It does get your point across, so please don't second-guess yourself if you have already sent something, but it could be a bit more professional and straightforward.\n\nNot that I think they shouldn't hear you out either way. Fully agree that it's ridiculous that they're trying to enforce this, but it's harder to dismiss a well-written argument. I think whomever it may concern would be more willing to play ball with some stronger wording.\n\nI swear I'm not trying to be a condescending prick, I just want to help. I speak from experience about tactfully bitching at Kettering admin. PM me and I'd be happy to help you make revisions, strengthen your argument, and track down the correct person to elevate this to :)",

This decision, based on their response to you, isn't theirs to make from the sounds of it. If you want the exception to be made for you, they are going to make you do the legwork of taking it up with whoever ultimately makes this decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, it sounds like you just need to send an email. I would recommend that your email focus on why you specifically should be exempt from the rule. Asking the university \"to appeal your decision\" probably isn't the direction you want to go in with this. In theory, they would have already had a lot of discussion about this internally and probably will not budge for you on this one. So, for example, your economic example probably won't get you what you want since financial issues are something that impacts everyone. It sounds like you have already found a housing arrangement. If you can attach proof of payments or even your lease (if you have it) and show that you committed to something legally binding before they sent out their notice, I'm sure that will make them at least take your request seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; email them with documents that prove that you are special and should be exempt from the live-in policy.",

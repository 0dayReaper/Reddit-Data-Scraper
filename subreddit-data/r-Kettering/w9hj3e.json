We were given much the same line about \"supporting the University\".\n\nAlso, DECA used to run a coffee/snack shop up in 4th AB to raise funds for their competition trips.   It ran on the honor system.  You could even bring your own coffee mug and leave it there to re-use it.   It worked great ... until Sodexo heard about it and forced it to shut down :(.",

I was unaware of any requirements to purchase food through Sodexo; we would get food from whatever pizza or catering place people wanted and never had any issues getting reimbursed. Hope this helps, even though it is just anecdotal (the hard drive that should contain the spreadsheets and receipt photocopies is 800 miles away, in my parents' attic so unless someone's willing to pay me a substantial amount to recover it, anecdotal will have to do lol).\n\n&gt;Also, DECA used to run a coffee/snack shop up in 4th AB to raise funds for their competition trips.

I remember that I would occasionally throw in an extra $5-10 for a $0.50 snack just because it was so convenient, reasonably priced and an overall cool move by DECA.",

If you need Microsoft office you can get that at KU, any CAD software is the same. we use NX and SolidWorks here and you can get both of those through Kettering as a student.\n\nnow if you're new to computers I'll make a couple of suggestions.This link is for anything that's good enough with a large screen and enough storage to get you through kettering assuming you're not doing any video storage.

I've also done nearly no engineering work with my desktop up to this point so a laptop without capabilities to do CAD work is just fine, you can almost get away with a $200 chrome book for most of your course work but I really dislike chrome OS. If I were starting at KU and didn't have a desktop but needed to do work and play some games with friends here is the exact setup I would get.  This is keeping in mind that a lot of students would like to be able to play some games while at school as well as having a nice monitor and peripherals is fantastic for just typing up papers in your room or even to just watch Netflix or do anything else. in total this comes out to about $1426 after tax and lands within your budget and should last you through Kettering pretty well. the laptop is a bit \"gamer\" with is red design but I'd rather have something with decent specs for a reasonable price than something that looks good and cooks itself to death.\n\nMy Personal Choices\n\nLaptop\n\n[https://www.newegg.com/black-msi-gaming-gl73/p/1TS-0016-00N44?Item=9SIAEYAA9V6936](https://www.newegg.com/black-msi-gaming-gl73/p/1TS-0016-00N44?Item=9SIAEYAA9V6936)\n\nKeyboard[https://www.newegg.com/logitech-k840-920-008350-usb-wired/p/0GA-0001-00599?Item=0GA-0001-00599&amp;nm\\_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm\\_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;utm\\_medium=affiliates&amp;utm\\_source=afc-PCPartPicker&amp;AFFID=2558510&amp;AFFNAME=PCPartPicker&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASID=https%3a%2f%2fpcpartpicker.com%2fproduct%2f77MwrH%2flogitech-k840-wired-standard-keyboard-920-008350&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=2558510&amp;ranSiteID=8BacdVP0GFs-EicQt2PS7mPTryTmHS3AKA](https://www.newegg.com/logitech-k840-920-008350-usb-wired/p/0GA-0001-00599?Item=0GA-0001-00599&amp;nm_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_source=afc-PCPartPicker&amp;AFFID=2558510&amp;AFFNAME=PCPartPicker&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASID=https%3a%2f%2fpcpartpicker.com%2fproduct%2f77MwrH%2flogitech-k840-wired-standard-keyboard-920-008350&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=2558510&amp;ranSiteID=8BacdVP0GFs-EicQt2PS7mPTryTmHS3AKA)\n\nMouse[https://www.newegg.com/corsair-ch-9308011-na-m55-rgb-pro-usb-2-0-wired/p/N82E16826816134?Item=N82E16826816134&amp;nm\\_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm\\_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;utm\\_medium=affiliates&amp;utm\\_source=afc-PCPartPicker&amp;AFFID=2558510&amp;AFFNAME=PCPartPicker&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASID=https%3a%2f%2fpcpartpicker.com%2fproduct%2fDYPKHx%2fcorsair-m55-rgb-pro-wired-optical-mouse-ch-9308011-na&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=2558510&amp;ranSiteID=8BacdVP0GFs-mCauDEZXdI9J6SsGzi6ZXg](https://www.newegg.com/corsair-ch-9308011-na-m55-rgb-pro-usb-2-0-wired/p/N82E16826816134?Item=N82E16826816134&amp;nm_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_source=afc-PCPartPicker&amp;AFFID=2558510&amp;AFFNAME=PCPartPicker&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASID=https%3a%2f%2fpcpartpicker.com%2fproduct%2fDYPKHx%2fcorsair-m55-rgb-pro-wired-optical-mouse-ch-9308011-na&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=2558510&amp;ranSiteID=8BacdVP0GFs-mCauDEZXdI9J6SsGzi6ZXg)\n\nMonitor\n\n[https://www.newegg.com/hp-2kz35a6-aba-27-full-hd/p/N82E16824276669?Item=N82E16824276669&amp;nm\\_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm\\_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;utm\\_medium=affiliates&amp;utm\\_source=afc-PCPartPicker&amp;AFFID=2558510&amp;AFFNAME=PCPartPicker&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASID=https%3a%2f%2fpcpartpicker.com%2fproduct%2fNKCD4D%2fhp-v270-270-1920x1080-60-hz-monitor-2kz35a6aba&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=2558510&amp;ranSiteID=8BacdVP0GFs-7hPmaCZtScGhSs2yEVkI8g](https://www.newegg.com/hp-2kz35a6-aba-27-full-hd/p/N82E16824276669?Item=N82E16824276669&amp;nm_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_source=afc-PCPartPicker&amp;AFFID=2558510&amp;AFFNAME=PCPartPicker&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASID=https%3a%2f%2fpcpartpicker.com%2fproduct%2fNKCD4D%2fhp-v270-270-1920x1080-60-hz-monitor-2kz35a6aba&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=2558510&amp;ranSiteID=8BacdVP0GFs-7hPmaCZtScGhSs2yEVkI8g)\n\nwith that said if you're feeling handy you could build yourself a desktop to handle most of your computing needs for cheaper and then have a very cheap laptop to bring to class for notes and take data for labs.  \n\n\nAnd if you're concerned about the lighting effects or designs of computers you can turn off the lighting, but the design you're stuck with. luckily everyone knows you're stuck with a design and wont care about it. besides that at work you'll be forced to use a modern machine made to look like its straight out of 2010 and with lower specs than anyone would recommend for even a students laptop going into college. dont stress out too much over design if you're going to have to spend $300 to get the same computer looking \"professional\". this is a problem you can fix with duct tape and stickers (or skins that many vendors have available for laptops)",

Just remember you will want to install Windows 10 in Bootcamp any Apple devices, as some of the software you will need is Windows Only.  Make sure the system is running Windows 10 Pro.\n\nIf you are buying new, do not spend less than $1000 on the machine in question, and you will likely want to look at something closer to the $1500 range.  I would also suggested a comfortable keyboard, mouse/hamster, and larger external screen to setup at a desk to make some of your work (and play) easier.\n\nAvoid HP like the plague. Dell/Alienware are okay machines, but getting the drivers back, if you have to replace your hard drive, or reformat (and you will, multiple times), can be a pain in the ass.",

Unless you love OneNote or taking notes on your computer already, I had a desktop for half my time at Kettering and loved it. You'll have to meet up in labs for group work anyways, and you can just push your group to meet in a computer lab instead of a whiteboard lab for those. Campus is super tiny and everyone lives there the first year, so everyone can easily get to a lab you suggest or meet you at your dorm or wherever you end up living after your freshman year.\n\nI was only ever mildly inconvenienced by owning a desktop for almost three years. So if you like gaming or doing really crazy stuff in CAD, I'd consider a desktop if you're fine with the occasional inconvenience of portability in exchange for cheaper and more custom builds.\n\nAlso IT gives out a couple dozen computers every year when they update ones in labs. They sell them for $1 (monitors for another $1), comes with Ubuntu on them. Really all you need as a freshman and as The other guy in here suggests, buy a shitty $1k, spend another $1k on tools and have a shit ton of fun in the school parking lot pulling off the muffler and back seats and doning tray slidies.",

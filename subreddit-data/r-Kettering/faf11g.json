No one thinks it shouldn't occur, it should just be less of a burden on the students paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a college education, which BY THE WAY, also work their asses-off for YEARS pursuing what WE care about, that often being ACTUAL robotics and engineering.\n\nAnd since you are obviously a FRC-affiliated parent/mentor/student, etcetera, I'm sure that despite all the numerous people disagreeing with you, down-voting you, all of whom are paying students whose opinions on how their school is run matter much more than those of high schoolers, the wool will never be lifted from your eyes.

Safety like ticketing cars parked illegally when they decide they should make it look like they're doing work. Health like providing the wellness center to diagnose you with the sick and you shouldn't go to class. risk like Sodexo possibly trying to make the food palatable only for the school to shut them down and serve cold hot dogs. campus like the 50% thats currently fenced off for the school to build its covid19 bunker. Top priority like how they're topping students and getting paid to do it before caring about anything else. but hey at the end of the day at least they installed a new parking lot across the street.\n\nObligatory this post is a joke and shouldnt be taken seriously if any faculty staff or students read it without being able to understand contextual sarcasm. I think its the ultimate power move to say we're not closing at this time because its being reported as far worse than we've seen and the students here are smart enough to not panic the same day information comes out without validating what it means or how it will actually impact them. the memes are good though, keep them rolling its something I'm going to miss when B-Section goes back in a few weeks",

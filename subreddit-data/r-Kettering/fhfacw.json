Some of us have old or immunocompromised relatives, some of us live over seas, or have to travel a far distance to get back home. Some of us simply can\u2019t afford to be behind our peers in our classes.\n\nNot only that, but us A section students are going to coop soon. It\u2019s very possible that we can get sick, and spread it to our workplace before we notice the symptoms.\n\nDownplaying the severity of this virus is helping no one. Just because the virus will have very little negative effects on you, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t incredibly dangerous.",

As you said it\u2019s very dangerous and spreads quickly and you\u2019re going to your co-ops soon. There\u2019s so many other spots everyone is risking of getting it. As of now there are 0 known cases on campus or in the entire county, so how is shutting down classes going to still help prevent that.  If there were known cases you\u2019d have an argument, but this outrage students are causing over closing the school is ridiculous considering all high schools are still open and have more kids enrolled. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to view not closing the school YET as outrageous considering what\u2019s known.",

As stated in another comment here, it\u2019s incredibly possible that there\u2019s dozens of students who have been exposed to the virus already, without realizing it.\n\n This also coincides with cold season, so there\u2019s already tons of students walking around campus with stuffy noses, coughs, sore throats, who are unable to distinguish between early symptoms of Covid-19 and a cold or flu.\n\nYou\u2019re also wrong about local schools, I\u2019ve heard from friends in the area that local high schools are taking steps towards cancelling classes, and UM flint is switching to online classes for the time being. Not only that, but there\u2019s a major difference between colleges and high schools, mainly there are students living in the Petri dish that is TH.\n\nAnother point you made is we\u2019re just as likely to get it at work. That\u2019s blatantly false, think about it for a minute. A majority of this universities population lives in close proximity to each other, either in TH, a fraternity house, CV, or an off campus residence. If one Delt, for example, gets sick, the virus will easily spread to around 50 people, who will then go on to spread it even further. Same for students living in TH, one sick person in TH WILL have disastrous effects. Compare that to our coworkers at our coops. A majority of them live in houses with no more than 3 other people. They\u2019re not crammed in with roommates. Their desks are spread far apart. \n\nAnd still, prevention doesn\u2019t hurt anybody. The fact that people are downplaying this virus is amazing, there are lives at risk. Even if it\u2019s by a small amount, Kettering switching to online classes will, in the grand scheme of things, save lives! It\u2019s simple math, less people exposed to the virus equals less people dying from it. \n\nThink about the people around you, for many students on this campus any measure of prevention is a necessity.",

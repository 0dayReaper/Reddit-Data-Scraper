    "postText": "So here we are, stirring up the shit pot once again.\n\nKettering's admins are having a grand ol' time dealing with the lose-lose situation that is of the pandemic. Who do you choose to appease? Those that want to move on already? Or those that are scared of covid? Ideally you can please both, but unfortunately that isn't an option anymore (refer to many discussions on hybrid if you don't know why).\n\nReality check:\n\n* Kettering's faculty and staff are (in general) much more at-risk than the student body due to age and developed health conditions\n* Kettering's student body is comprised of young individuals (some of which who are at-risk)\n* Everyone who works for and attends Kettering has mixed emotions/opinions on covid\n* Effectiveness of antigen tests are questionable - they are rather easy to fake out and aren't as accurate as PCR tests (although more convenient/cheaper for everyone, it's a trade-off)\n* A number of students have not reported positive tests to the Wellness Center\n* Students/faculty/staff aren't (and SHOULD NOT BE) bound to strictly living in a locked cell having a tray of food slid under the door. They are going out, seeing people, and potentially ignoring covid\n* Part 22: electric kazoo is extremely infectious and has shown to bypass vaccination with ease\n* Covid is becoming difficult to distiguish from normal daily health annoyances for some, but leaves others bed-ridden\n* Public backlash would be virtually inevitable if everyone was told to just suck it up\n* Student body backlash already exists for online\n\nNow make your choice. If it seems easy for you, chances are you haven't made enough considerations.\n\nKettering admins have a literal mountain of considerations to make, which may or may not lead to death or hospitalization (for some individuals).\n\nDo you try to extinguish the already advancing fire? Do you give up? Do you cater to the majority and ignore the minority? Do you try to protect the minority? There is much more to this decision than just \"fuck the students, take their money\" or \"lock everyone down, it's going to kill us all.\"\n\n\\##### \\[Edit\\] #####\n\nHere is administration's compromise: reduce the chance for professors to contract covid by hosting classes virtually. Allow students to use campus resources to their own benefit AND allow for in-person club attendance. They could've just as easily told student organizations to go virtual or have wrath. Intramural sports are still active, the rec center is still operating, you can still go on campus and interact with other students. Is it the same as summer 2019? Absolutely not. But, it's administration's attempt to continue promoting healthy social activity while protecting everyone in a reasonable manner.\n\nGroup study sessions are still more than possible to be had. It does not replace in-person teaching, but it would still be more beneficial than strictly learning virtually as students can help one another. Office hours are also (for many professors) able to be had in-person, not just online. Obviously you're not going to have a whole class taught to you, but you can communicate and work with your professors in the real world to better understand concepts that are difficult.\n\nAward edit: thank you for your kind gesture :)\n\n\\##### \\[Edit\\] #####\n\nThe results are in: we are fast tracking the return to normal. Professors and students are at their own discretion to wear masks. Professors may request students to wear masks in their sessions, and groups may choose to do so on their own as well. Administration is asking for everyone to be respectful of each other's concerns.",

Not saying it will be easy, or cheap, but it needs to be done, and quickly.",

Everything I've been seeing from Kettering indicates this as well. I'll be going from Dean's list to D's list if we're virtual the whole term. Covid is likely not going to go away. This is the same thing that happened with the flu so we have to ask ourselves, we really just going to keep being scared forever? There have been some good things that have come our of the pandemic but overall life is much worse now.\n\nAlso, have not heard why hybrid would be bad.",

Of course, it was Kettering's official line in December that we'd be F2F for Week 1, and it was Kettering's official line in Week 1 that we'd be F2F by Week 3.   (I'm not saying that to be critical; stuff happens, and plans change.)    So, I think it's perfectly reasonable to wonder whether or not we will stay with that announced plan, or pivot to some different plan.\n\nHybrid is hard for instructors because it's neither one mode nor the other.   If I plan an in-class activity, I have to somehow plan an equivalent online activity.   I can probably manage it just fine as a CS instructor, but I have no freaking clue how the chem labs run virtually.  (I know they did it, because they had to, but ... yuck.) \n\nHaving said that, just because hybrid is hard doesn't mean it's not a valid option.   As the OP points out, there's a lot of options on the table, all of which are \"bad\" in some way or for someone.",

You will always find people who you don't understand, and you *will* have to work with them regardless. Although you and I are thoroughly over the pandemic, many people aren't, and we still have to be reasonable to others.",

Generally working to reduce the spread of the disease makes it less likely that our vulnerable friends can contract it --- and, as we should've seen, makes it less likely that the disease will mutate into a dozen variants with different characteristics, teaching us new letters in the Greek alphabet every few months.\n\n\"Realistic\" is in the eye of the beholder.

Staff and faculty need to be paid, things still need to be purchased to maintain facilities (that you do have the ability to access), research is still being done, and bills still need to be paid. The vast majority of your tuition is not going to McMahan, but rather everyone else that makes your education possible.\n\nu/jkhuggins has expanded on this earlier, but it isn't necessarily a possibility.\n\nIf you want online tuition rates, SNHU is accepting applications. I say this because SNHU has the infrastructure designed for online courses. Kettering never was intended to be virtual, so there are tons of on-campus resources that need to be maintained.",

You can walk around campus and do everything you normally would, minus attend classes in-person.\n\nBesides, where do you expect this money to come from? If you expect Kettering to close up campus and layoff a huge chunk of its employees, I'd consider that rather self-centered.\n\nIf you want to pay online tuition rates, transfer to a school that doesn't have physical infrastructure that needs to be maintained. Your tuition is being used the same now as it was used in 2019.\n\nIt covers paychecks of employees. It funds clubs, rec center resources, software licenses, lab maintenance, building maintenance, electrical bills, water bills, and many other resources.\n\nWho doesn't get to feed their family? Which clubs are you tossing out? Which labs do you want to get worse? How cold do you want buildings to be? Which current research projects do you want to put on hold? Which rooms don't get cleaned? Which paper towel dispensers do you want empty? If everyone this term got just $5000 back, that's *~$4 million.*\n\nKettering's tuition is as much as it is because of the on-campus resources. They are available. Use them. Get your tuition's worth.",

Required classes and optional resources that have no actual value, outdated classrooms and lab equipment, professors that should have retired years ago, among others.  I am not saying it is ALL bad, but Kettering is probably rolling in his grave right now.",

She's been there for over 30 years and still can't do her job right.\n\nNot everything can be maintained to everyone's ever increasing standards, either.\n\nIt's no excuse to not maintain and update, but Kettering admins have determined that it's more beneficial to put money in certain places over others. Or the money they have is through grants or bonds which inherently are limited to specific uses (like the LC).\n\nIf you feel that Kettering is unable to fulfill your needs, perhaps it isn't the best fit for you. There is nothing wrong with that, people transfer in and out all the time for one reason or another. That isn't to say that I'm team Kettering, I have criticisms myself, but it is always an option for those that feel that they are affected to the point that they are not going to be successful. Your personal success is important, and sometimes a school can't make it happen for you.",

Partly that's because some faculty prefer to handle academic dishonesty privately and don't notify anyone else (which students usually appreciate, right?).\n\nBut the anecdotes I hear from fellow professors are not encouraging.\n\nPersonally, I've dealt with more academic dishonesty cases in the last 9 months than in the previous five years combined.  And that's only the cases that I've been able to detect; I'm not arrogant enough to believe that I know everything that's going on.\n\nDisclaimer: anecdotes are not data.   (But, as I said above, I'm not sure that data exists.)",

I am thinking if they have that data, they certainly have aggregate data on how everyone at the university and maybe they have come to the conclusion after talking with professors that the grades are too high due to academic dishonesty with students?\n\nIf that is the case, I certainly understand why they would want to implement a some sort of lockdown browser/extension, easy grades certainly devalue our degrees as a whole.",

I know that various statistics related to grades are generated and reviewed from time to time, but only by those parties who might need that information.   (For example, I know that the University monitors withdraw/failure rates, and was especially concerned about them once the pandemic started.)\n\nIn my opinion (AND MY OPINION ONLY), I don't think the University would take this action  because they think \"grades are too high\".   If that was the case, it'd be much more effective to fire everyone in the ASC and Wellness Center and watch overall GPAs plummet.   Kettering does want students to succeed --- but, of course, succeed defined as  \"mastering the body of knowledge of your discipline\", not succeed defined as \"pass all your courses\".",

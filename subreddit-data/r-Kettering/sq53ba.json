    "postText": "For CS students, from Dr. Farmer: \n\nIf you want to convert to the CS 141-credit curriculum (and you probably should), send an email to Doris to indicate you want to switch.   The switch won't be made until July, when the new catalog becomes active.   \n\nFor your Summer/Fall 2022 course selections: make sure to do a \"What-If\" analysis with the 2022-2023 catalog.   (Your advisor should be able to show you how, if you haven't seen it.)",

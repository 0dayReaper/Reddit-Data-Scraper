The entire conflict in the Middle East is a mess and we got involved to try to create a stable democracy to have as an ally in the region.  People like you are the reason that the Taliban took over Afghanistan again.\n\n2. When was the last time isolationism ended well for us?\n\n3. If it becomes necessary that we are called upon to defend Ukraine or Taiwan, we had better damn well do it, no matter what willfully ignorant people like you have to say about it.\n\nWe as a nation have our flaws, and thats undeniable, however out of the largest military powers on earth, we are the only one to stand for freedom and democracy.  It's our responsibility to ensure that we use our ridiculous amount of military spending to protect smaller nations' right of self determination.",

So a threat to the world's oil supply would be destructive. Countries' economies would collapse, mass unemployment, supply shortages, increase in Inflation, and costs of goods. Or we simply just recognize terrorist groups as valid governments. Pay them for oil rights and hope they don't use the money to fund more efforts to expand the subjection. Also, allowing the occupants to experience war crimes and human rights violations.\n\nFun fact: unemployment corresponds with suicides and the death rate.\n\nI think a lot of you don't understand the true value of being able to criticize the government. China/Russia bruh you best be looking over your shoulder if you're trying to start shit. The US government has a great many faults and catches but you can legally challenge the laws through the courts, run for public office to make an impact, and openly criticize the government's actions and protest. Try being gay in Russia or organize a protest against the Chinese government in China. They still have pictures and revere the man that killed 6+ million during his regime.\n\nAlso, fighting authoritarian governments preparing to invade sovereign countries, suppressing human rights, free speech, and creation of Muslim work camps aren't good reasons?",

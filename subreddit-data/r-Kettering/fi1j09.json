I know a few of them lurk here, so I just wanted to say those efforts shouldn't go unappreciated.",

They are doing all they can to make sure we still get the education we need in an even shorter timeframe. \n\nAlso lets not forget the other staff at Kettering who are working hard to keep the transition from A section to B section smooth. They have probably made a lot of hard decisions to make sure we all stay safe and still get our education.\n\nThank you all very much!",

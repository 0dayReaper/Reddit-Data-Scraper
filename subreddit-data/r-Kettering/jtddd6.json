            "comment": "I had Obsniuk for 114 and Bedoor for 115. Obsniuk is one of those profs that tend to make tests/quizzes more difficult in certain aspects than the average work done in class. Bedoor just demands good quality and thoughtful work in class and in the papers (I had him for phys 1 and 2). I didn't necessarily struggle too bad in Obsniuk's course but I had some... questions... Bedoor said that my group preformed much better than other groups but that was because we gave a decigram of care and got a kilogram of a grade back.\n\nJust do reasonable work for either of them and you should be fine. Keep in mind that the internet is a great resource when it comes to physics and understanding how certain calculations were developed.",

Didn't really study super hard, just did the homework, made an effort to understand the labs, and paid attention during class. I think that as long as you practice the work you're given and really understand /why/ things are the way they are, you'll do great. I remember having a good mix of \"solve the problem\" vs \"explain why x happens\" questions on tests/quizzes.\n\n\nAlso he was pretty understanding about me missing two days and a lab for a funeral, told people to call him Mike, and talked to me about anime, so overall a cool dude.",

He does teach actual physics though which is good, and he is very good about questions and will even write notes on quizzes related to what was specifically wrong. Good feedback and good at answering questions in a way students can easily understand.",

I did fine with Calc 1-3 I'm just getting sick of these Kettering math profs. \n\nPlease don't comment, you should have tried harder, yes I know you can always try harder or try again. I am just looking for different options to make it a little easier. \n\nThanks!",

When you retake the class at Kettering, your new grade will replace the failed one and improve your GPA. Taking it at a different school will just give you the credit that you passed, but that F will stay, affecting your GPA negatively. \n\nMy suggestion is to retake the class at Kettering to help out your GPA. If you email a math professor you like, they will usually let you know what hours they are teaching even if it isn\u2019t posted so you can work your schedule to make sure you get a good one.",

            "comment": "While there are methods to taking it outside of Kettering, GPA wise it might be best for you to retry it at Kettering. Depending on who you have, it may go significantly better. O'Toole is a favorite and Salacuse isn't bad if you can find a good tutor/SI (ASC has some). It's passable, at least, and some people figure out the profs earlier on so you can switch if you have a professor you failed last time. Some just don't click with people, ya know?\n\nOtherwise, check  [https://kuapps.kettering.edu/kuapps/f?p=179:4:::NO](https://kuapps.kettering.edu/kuapps/f?p=179:4:::NO)",

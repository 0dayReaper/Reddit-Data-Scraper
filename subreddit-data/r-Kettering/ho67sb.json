I was looking over lab manuals for classes and seems like we have to be there every week but the safe return prevents us from doing so (we attend labs once every other week depending on the group). Are they going to replace it with simulated labs from weeks we can't go to campus? \n\nAnyone have any insight on this? Thanks!",

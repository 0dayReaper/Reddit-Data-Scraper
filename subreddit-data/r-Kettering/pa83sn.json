I have a hard time believing  cheating is it, because internet/crib access won't even help you on pretty much any exam in a 300+ level class. There's got to be some kind of obscure angle here I'm just missing? There's no way they can seriously be THAT disconnected.\n\nIs it labs or something? That's the only thing I can think of that isn't made of stupid. Even then, that's just once a week for most students if they put everything else online, and that would actually make it feasible to implement some of these anti-covid measures without requiring Campo to grow geometrically to actually pull off.",

Labs is a big reason.   One of our traditional selling points is \"hands-on experience\", and you don't get that online.   Sure, there are online simulators, but it ain't the same.\n2. Students told us they overwhelmingly *hated* online classes.  As much as y'all complain that administrators don't listen to student complaints, they were paying attention to this one.\n3. Cheating is definitely a factor.  It's not merely about crib access.  I had next-level cheating going on --- like students posting exam questions to Chegg and hoping someone would answer for them.  No crib-proof exam can stop someone from paying someone else to write your answers.  \nThat's why they spent a crap-ton of money on HonorLock instead of giving pay raises to faculty and staff.  \nI heard a number of students say that professors should just give harder exams to compensate for the cheating.  Like y'all need us to make your lives even harder in the middle of a blessed pandemic.\n\nAnd that's all I'm willing to say publicly.",

Honestly, I struggle more sitting in class because I'm getting the same monotonous lectures that I had online. They, however, were 10x as convenient as I was keeping up with my daily chores as I was participating in class.\n\nThe cheating part I understand, and I absolutely hated honorlock because of how invasive it was. I did find that tests that allowed open resources to be much more beneficial because I felt that they were more conducive to taking quality notes that had the information you needed rather than scrolling online for 30 minutes (although still possible for those few problems that you come across). \n\nOnline learning is very different compared to in-person and it wasn't the professors' fault for the drastic difference. Online collaboration and teaching is just not something you can learn in a week. It's a skill that needs to be built over time with some trial and error.\n\nMany of my professors had done very well considering the circumstances, very few were not doing well enough.",

(Mostly because almost no-one was doing online synchronous education before we got forced into it.)\n\nThis leads to the following problems with your seemingly reasonable suggestion:\n\n* Hiring those few adept faculty was hard, because *everyone* wanted to hire them.   Just because you want to hire doesn't mean there's enough people out there to make it possible to hire.   (And that's before you even begin to talk about the difficulty in attracting faculty to teach in Flint.)\n* If you want to teach old faculty new skills, great; who's going to do the teaching?   Again, very few people had the skills to teach others, and they were in great demand.\n* The skills involved aren't merely about technology/video production.   I can go through seminars about how to click all the buttons in Collaborate (and I did).   It's a whole other thing entirely to figure out *why* to click those buttons: that is, how to use (and not use) all those fancy-schmancy features to create an effective educational environment.   Trust me, I know; I spent three months scouring the Internet to attend any seminar I could find about effective online teaching, and mostly found people selling their own favorite brand of snake oil.   (That was one of the reasons I turned to this subreddit in December 2020 to get suggestions on hybrid teaching.)",

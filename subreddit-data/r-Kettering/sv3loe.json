What has your experience been with return on investment?\n\n2. I am really interested in automotive engineering, but I don't want to box myself into a certain discipline. This is kind of a silly question, but how broad is the mechanical engineering major at Kettering? Is it difficult to find opportunities outside of the automotive sector?\n\n3. How generous is Kettering with grants and scholarships? I was offered 17.5k in merit rewards and 5.5k in loans, but that still puts me in a huge bind for paying for school. I applied to a bunch of the scholarships on ScholarshipUniverse but because my folks make 6 figures it looks like I can pay for more than I realistically can (big family, plus special needs siblings so a lot of the money goes in that direction), and I don't usually get offered a lot of aid besides what I get off of merit. I'm a pretty good student with good test scores so I usually can earn some good merit but I'm still worried. What has your experience been with paying for school?\n\n4. Is it worth it? I guess that's really what I'm asking. There's a lot that sort of scares me about Kettering---it's far from home, the costs and the idea of jumping right into a co-op first quarter (got placed as B-section) is both exciting and scary, but there's something about Kettering that really calls out to me, and I could really see myself going there, I just don't want to land myself in a pit of debt that I can't climb out of. What made Kettering worth it for you?\n\nSorry that might not be grammatically correct, but I typed it all out in one go. Thank you for your time, have a wonderful day.",

            "comment": "1.  Alumni checking in. Kettering was expensive.  I had some sizeable financial support from Kettering,  but still walked away with ~$80k in debt.  For me,  it was comparable gross cost to other Universities with notable Engineering program.  That said,  I would never consider Kettering for anything other than their main engineering programs. I will say some opportunities opened for me because of Kettering in my resume so there are benefits that go with that high cost. \n\n\n2. Mechanical discipline will really depend on where you want to co-op and if you are locked to a location.  From East side of MI and won't leave it,  you are likely auto or auto adjacent. My group of 10 guys we had in 2 apartments across at Campus Village had 50% Auto, then DoD, Muni utilities (water), bio, and so on. There definitely is variety of you are open to it. \n\n3. Other than what I mentioned in 1. above,  I took student loans out.  I had little federal loan available,  so took the test on private student loans (Discover student,  Sallie Mae, and one other I can't remember...). I used my co-op pay for the things the loans didn't cover and for everything co-op term related.\n\n4. Honestly I struggle to this day if it was worth it 100% for me. I'm from MI, so UofM would have been a cheaper experience.  Is the academia better at Kettering? I don't think so.  You lose a lot cutting down to 10 or 11 weeks of class. The campus ( at least when I was there) and off campus area certainly isn't a draw (yay Flint?). The co-op though is the largest draw. You can get 2-3 years of legitimate work experience before you graduate. Alumni and many in Engineering recognize Kettering. Like I said earlier,  I know things opened for me because of the name alone (but would the same have happened with a different name- I dunno)",

You don't need to go to Kettering the whole time to get the benefits of a co-op, IMO the only real benefit to starting at Kettering is being able to form relationships with your peers for longer. I switched co-ops my junior year (was a dual major, dropped the one I was hired for and picked up a concentration in the other) and I'm currently working for them full time, which I think highlights how the first couple years don't really matter in the long run.",

            "comment": "Recent alumni here, can't stress using co-op money to pay for tuition enough. Don't fall into the trap of \"disposable income\" just because you CAN get loans to cover tuition. I used almost all of my co-op earnings toward tuition and graduated with just over $25k in debt. It's doable to graduate from Kettering with a (somewhat) reasonable amount borrowed if you do it right. \n\nAs far as cornering yourself into automotive goes, I co-opped at an automation company on the west side of the state, so depending on the area, you can pretty easily escape automotive if you wanted to. \n\nHonestly, the co-op is the biggest draw to Kettering, but in my experience not every company will accept co-op experience as \"real work experience\" once you graduate. My co-op was unable to hire me on full time, and I had a notable number of companies turn me down citing lack of experience, specifically that co-op experience doesn't count, but the company I eventually got hired into told me that Kettering co-op experience was one of the deciding factors in extending me an offer. Just a personal anecdote, YMMV. \n\nI would say Kettering was worth it for my ME degree, but there were a fair share of drawbacks that came with it.",

            "comment": "1) Not an alumni, but I am a senior. Co-ops are great if you can get one, and most people do. Has been a little rough past two years with Covid, but now that things are getting going I think things are back to normal co-op wise. It was rough for me finding my first and not having one for two years (I think) but now that I have one, great.\n\n2) It's easy to find opportunities *inside* the automotive sector, but I'd say it's normal to find some outside too. There is loads of companies at the job fair, and while half (if not more) are automotive, there's also a bunch that aren't.\n\n3) Fairly generous, and it stacks with how good your grades are. I had to take one private loan for like, 2k, and I do take some gov loans, but like I said this is because I didn't have a co-op for half my time here. Now that I am making money I don't think I will need to take loans for future semesters. At least I hope not.\n\n4) It is more worth it than other colleges, but all colleges are getting a little questionable worth-it wise. Honestly the co-op is a huge selling point, I've learned more on the job than I have in the classroom by a wide margin. Talking to my co-workers, this is the case no matter what school you go to, but Kettering's benefit is that you start on the job while you're still in school. Take a grad from Kettering and one from another school that doesn't have a co-op, the first has a couple years (ideally) experience under his belt from day one, the other has to start then. Big big difference.\n\nHope that helped!",

            "comment": "There\u2019s a few good things about Kettering. The co-op is great, you graduate with 2.5 years of work experience and make money along the way. There are very few gen ed classes that you have to take, so you\u2019re taking classes related to your major for the most part. Lastly, small class sizes make for a better learning environment in my opinion. However, a lot of the professors here are horrible, the administration does not care about the students at all, and the food is garbage. Don\u2019t get me started on how outdated the classrooms are. You\u2019ll be using desks that are actually from the 1970\u2019s. So take this all as you will. Overall, I\u2019d say if you want a focused academic career in engineering, Kettering is a good place. But if you\u2019re looking for a good college experience, go somewhere else.",

            "comment": "I'm an alumni, graduated in the Fall of 2021, so I'm pretty freshly done.\n\n1) The cost is a big drawback, but if you play your cards right, you can graduate without that much debt. The co-op really helps with the payment. I personally made about $25,000 in my 5 co-op rotations. Also, I condensed the 4.5 year program into 3 years, (only transferred in credits from calc 1 from high school), and graduating sooner is cheaper as well. We're talking a whole year and a half of classes so that saved literally well over ten thousand of dollars. As far as return on investment, I just started a job that they straight up told me that they wouldn't have hired me without my co-op experience, and it pays remarkably well. Also, last time I checked, which was when I was in your shoes, Kettering had a higher average salary for graduates than MIT.\n\n2) If you're interested in the automotive field, Kettering is for you. There is nothing else like it. That was my favorite part about Kettering: just being able to nerd out with a bunch of students and professors who have worked in the automotive field about cars and automotive design. But don't worry about boxing yourself in. Mechanical engineering is a super diverse field, and there are literally thousands of possible fields you could practice in with a ME degree.  I was an ME, on the FSAE team, and graduated with an emphasis in automotive design, but now I design air compressors, so in terms of being boxed in out of college, you don't need to worry about it.\n\n3) Kettering can be very generous with grants, scholarships, and other things. While I didn't really do the work to get as much as I could, I know someone who will graduate with about $35k of debt, and that is doing 4.5 years with a co-op. That's not more than a lot of state schools, and if you want to, you will be able to pay that back in only a few years on the job as an engineer. \n\n4) In my opinion, Kettering is 100% worth it. I moved from California and I totally get how it's scary to move to Flint Michigan of all places, but it really is a great growth experience. Actually one of my top 5 annoyances about my time a Kettering is how often I heard things like \"well I'm just here because I'm from (town 20 min or less away) and it's nice to be close to home\". Kettering is a great school with great opportunity, and if you live close by, great, but that's not WHY you should go to Kettering. Moving on, if you're worried about getting a co-op straight out, you don't have to. I switched to A section although I was originally assigned to B section for this very reason. It is however worth noting how most B section kids don't actually work that first summer. For me what made Kettering worth the money was the co-op. The co-op gives you experiences that you simply cannot get at another school. My roommate got a co-op for Ford, and worked in the Ford Motorsport team for a rotation and then realized motorsport wasn't for him. If he hadn't been at Kettering he could have spent a lot of time working towards a disappointing job or wondering what might have been, but instead he got invaluable life experience and got a better understanding of what he wanted to do. As for me, my Co-Op at kettering exposed me to patent law, which is a field I plan on entering and I would never have considered it without Kettering. \n\nAs far as debt is concerned, you already show much more care about this kind of thing than 90% of people your age, and as long as you don't blow your money on stupid things like buying 5 cars while you're still in college (yes people at Kettering do this), then you should be ok. I know you hear horror stores of people who are buried by student loan debt, but those are not usually engineers. Engineering is a great field and it will give you a large return on your investment once you graduate. This is only true as long as you work hard and apply yourself though, so if you're looking for an easy time, then Kettering is not for you. \n\nAnyways, I hope this helps. All things considered, I really think that Kettering for me was the best choice, and definitely worth it, but there are also several other great schools nationwide and if you find a school that you like more, then you should go there. \n\nI know that this seems like it is a huge decision, and it totally is, but don't think that choosing poorly will screw up your life because it won't. If you really don't like wherever you go, especially as an underclassman, you can transfer to another school. Also, once you're on the job, people really don't seem to care about where you went to school (or at least that's my experience)",

Even with the Kettering scholarships, make no mistake it will still be much more expensive than comparable public schools (MSU, UofM). I'm not entirely convinced it was worth it over competing schools, but one thing is for sure, if you aren't going for engineering than it is ABSOLUTELY not worth it. The worst decision Kettering ever made was to try and compete with public schools in degrees that they do best (business, biology etc.). As for some numbers, I was able to crank out my debt pretty quickly. I've been out for \\~5 years, and I landed my first position at a supplier for $62,000 a year. 5 years later I broke six figures. So the money is decent, but it's impossible to tell whether Kettering had any impact there.\n2. You are probably going to feel centered in the automotive industry (at least at the start) because not a single soul has heard of Kettering/GMI outside the automotive sector. But, don't feel like you'll be pigeonholed into one discipline. I'm a mechanical engineer and now I test, benchmark, develop and program e-motors.\n3. It's expensive no matter what.\n4. Lots to unpack here, but I don't think you have to worry about being in debt forever. If you're smart you will claw your way out within the first little bit of your working life. As for whether it's worth it, I just don't know. The co-op is powerful, but to be honest, I help with a lot of the co-op hiring in our department and more and more schools are doing official co-ops or pushing internships. Honestly, we're usually more likely to take a student from OU, MSU, of UofM recently as they tend to be a bit more \"well rounded\" if that's a even a thing. We haven't been overly impressed with Kettering co-ops for a while. As for the school experience, mine was a bit different than most. I went to a medium sized school first, and got all the partying I could possibly want there. I went to Kettering after I was already 21, and actually really enjoyed the smaller size of things. There's more house/apartment parties than at bigger schools and that was refreshing for me (introvert). Also, coming from a bigger school where greek life isn't a thing, it was weird to see that at Kettering that was basically the best way of being social. Anyways, there's a lot to it, feel free to PM me if you want anymore questions or are looking for a co-op lol",

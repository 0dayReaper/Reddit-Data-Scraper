Company 2 paid for my housing for 2 term then left the Co-op program. Company 3 currently isn't helping with housing, but is paying me 2 dollars more than the other KU Co-op which MIGHT be because I was talking about help for housing; but on the same note, the two of us have compeltely different jobs so it's probably that.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I pocketed a majority of my housing stipend money via cheap Airbnb housing. Ohio was about ~$450/month for the place I picked and Texas was ~$600/month.",

But they do have apartments for $500 w all utilities except internet paid for, but they\u2019re occupied for b term. I like the company and want to work there but it\u2019s an hour drive on a good day just to get there. I imagine it\u2019ll be much worse for January-march. \n\nI\u2019ve read Airbnb is on the fritz, but I\u2019ll look into it. You know if any other websites that rent like that?",

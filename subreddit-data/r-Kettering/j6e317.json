I'd also assume she'll be teaching the class similarly to Professor Hargrove (who I had, he was fantastic). Considering all of this, I have a feeling she'll be a great professor.",

She\u2019s good at explaining things in different ways in case you just aren\u2019t getting it the first time, and if she\u2019s organized enough to run a DS2 lab that lets out on time, she\u2019ll have no problem doing Statics.",

    "postText": "So I took the initiative of sending an email to my supervisor about how I felt and my qualms with working at the company, and here\u2019s her response:\n\nShe said that it was her first time supervising someone and admitted she\u2019s not great at guidance, and that she takes full responsibility for not bringing me enough research opportunities. She also stated that the main reason she fired me was because of the \u201ccomplete lack of communication with the team\u201d and that I hadn\u2019t told anyone I cut so many tubes. She ended with it saying she hopes I find what suits me for the 15th time, and that she was happy to have me on the team.\n\nThis isn\u2019t really a response oriented post, but just a cap to my rant trilogy, and that it really doesn\u2019t go into specifics, but I just want to get it off my chest quickly.",

They didn\u2019t give a reason either, and Kettering did nothing about it. The co-op office is kind of a joke tbh. I wish you the best of luck on finding a new co-op.",

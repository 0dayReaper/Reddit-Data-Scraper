            "comment": "So if this were pre COvID-19 times, at any other school an online class would cost exactly the same as an in-person class. \n\nHowever in these mid COVID-19 times, you have the opportunity to transfer to any other school in Michigan right now and.... still be forced to take online classes! Fuck!\n\nAt the end of the day, the university is a non-profit business. Sure, there is decreased workload on the facilities staff perhaps, but everyone else is still working and needing to get paid. \n\nIf money is the issue, reach out to the school and work the problem like you would any other engineering problem. You\u2019ll talk to school employees who are just as scared and overwhelmed with the state of the world as you are, but who ultimately want to help. I found Kettering students always underestimate the value that face to face or voice to voice connection and communication play in finding solutions to issues. Give them a ring and see what they can do. We\u2019re in unprecedented times.",

If/when campus re-opens, you'll have the assurance of walking back into buildings that have been thoroughly sanitized.",

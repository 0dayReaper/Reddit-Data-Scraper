                    "comment": "The squiggles show the closing value per share at the end of the time period (1 minute intervals is what I chose bc short term analysis). The orange trend channels show downward trends, the value of each share was going down. The blue trend channels show upward trends, which meant that the stock reversed direction. If you bought at the bottom of the dip then you would've profited more and more the higher it went up the blue.\n\nThe analysis strictly showed the value and trend of the stocks, but volume and momentum need to be analyzed as well to make *informed* decisions. VWAP (volume-weighted average price) graphs are good at signaling good or bad times to buy or sell. MA (moving average) is good at determining resistance or support of the trend by seeing if the share value is below or above the average. There's tons of different indicators that can be used and combined to make a solid analysis so you can make an *informed* decision.\n\nMany people buying into these stocks have little experience (which I also have little experience, started investing in September) or are high risk traders that have little care about the losses they can incur from their trades. Many people also bought into these stocks knowing they are likely to lose the money because they just want to watch hedge fund managers lose billions. (Couple million investors averaging a few thousand dollars versus a few hedge funds averaging hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.)\n\nMy opinion is that one should do their best to make informed trading decisions, however high risk trades are totally valid as long as you're comfortable with the potential losses. Have a good entry plan and a good exit plan and you can capitalize on even high risk trades or reduce your overall risk.\n\nInvesting shouldn't be scary, just be informed and understand that you can lose all the money you have invested. Although small losses are normal, losing everything isn't commonplace unless you make only high risk trades.",

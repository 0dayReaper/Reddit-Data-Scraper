    "postText": "I've never bern tested for COVID at any point because I've been lucky enough to not be exposed to anyone nor have symptoms myself. I also wasn't too comfortable with going to the testing Kettering offered because I was hearing a lot of folks saying that it seemed high risk with too many people going for testing in one room, or something like that.  \n\nAnyways, I'm planning on living in a house off campus this term like I usually do, and the email we got gives me the impression that pretty much everyone is gonna be required to test, including those who are living in housing off campus but still coming to face to face classes. \n\nSo my question is, how's the test? \n\nI've heard there's two ways of testing, but the most accurate method of the two is the nose test. Is this the one Kettering does? Is it super comfortable? How long does it take to do? What's the whole process? \n\nI'm just curious how it all goes since it's looking like I'll be required to get tested before classes start, and I don't wanna overthink things/feel super anxious leading up to it. \n\nThanks for anyone who is willing to share their experience! :]",

They have you remove your mask or pull it down under your nose and they stick a big q-tip way up your nose for like 5 seconds. It feels really uncomfortable but it doesn't hurt. Prepare for your eyes to water and your nose to run for 10 minutes afterward. When they offer you kleenex afterward take some extras.\n* You pull your mask up, apply hand sanitizer, and leave.\n* This whole process has never taken longer than ~10 minutes for me",

I used to be in and out of the hospital for years with illness, and every so often they'd have to stick a tube up my nose. This definitely is worse than the covid test because they'd go all the way up and down my throat, but I'm worried the test will go far up enough to give me that same horrible discomfort... I've had major surgery twice and handled many horrible tests/treatments for 8 years, and the nose tube is still likely the worst experience I've ever had... \n\nIt's only like 5 seconds? Real quick? You'd say it's not too horrible? Sorry if my questions are dramatic, I've just been stressing about this a lot I think ):",

It really isn't super far up, it's enough to make your nose tingle inside while it's in and make your eyes water, but on the horrible scale I'd probably put it at a 2 out of 10. Me and a bunch of fraternity brothers went and took it together last term, and after we were all like \"that was not as bad as I was expecting\". I was nervous my first test too, so I get how you feel lol\n\nA warning: stay away from CVS tests, they make you do it yourself and it's 15 seconds in each nostril. It was pain",

You\u2019re done and they sent you your results like a week later. Some people swear it\u2019s the worst thing ever and they \u201cpOkE yOuR bRaIn\u201d but in all honesty it\u2019s not bad, just slight discomfort for a bit.",

            "comment": "I've had two COVID tests, both conducted at Kettering. The first time I did it, it was a cotton swap pretty far up the nose--quite uncomfortable, and brought some tears to the eyes. The second time, it was a swipe with a cotton swap at the shallowest part of the nostril--very comfortable, and honestly I was surprised they only had to go 1/2\" deep at most to get a good sample. I would imagine that tests will continue to be carried out the way it was my second time getting tested. Hope this helps.",

            "comment": "I truly don't think you have anything to worry about and, if you're concerned, go during a non-common hour time. I've had 2 COVID tests via Kettering and 1 via hospital for a procedure.    \n\n\nThey use a cotton swab up the nose for 15 seconds, it tickles and makes your eyes water (so skip the makeup, if you wear it) but it doesn't cause intense discomfort. I don't have much of a pain tolerance but even to me, it was like a mildly uncomfortable tickle.   \n\n\nFor the one I did in the Abbey, as a 'employee' for CILE, it was quick and pretty empty. Less than 10 minutes, all masks and everything set up 6ft apart. Everything laid out by PM\\_Me\\_Your\\_D\\_Spaces.   \n\n\nFor the one I did drive-by, my professor was COVID positive (I hadn't gone near him in weeks but they made me get tested anyways?), but since I was considered exposed I couldn't go into the Abbey. I had to do drive-by testing in which I stayed in my car, they took my temperature and handed me paperwork, took the paperwork and did the same cotton swab. No biggie, longest part was waiting in line in my car. But anyone known to be exposed isn't allowed to even do the test in the Abbey, it was done via drive thru testing by the pizza doors.  \n\n\nOnly real struggle is it took time for me to be back allowed on campus for the second one, but that's because they seem short-staffed. Nurse does say \"no news is good news\" though.",

I wouldn\u2019t have learned a damn thing in diffeq if I didn\u2019t have slader to teach me how to do the problems. And god help anyone taking dimitrov prob stats. He literally scribbles on the board and then puts his answer into webassign and half the time it\u2019s wrong.",

I've carried several Salacuse classes through and taught then everything myself, set up a groupchat for round the clock questions. Etc. Because I know how awful he is.

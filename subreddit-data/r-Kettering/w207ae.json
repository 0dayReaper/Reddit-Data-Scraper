A career Kettering sees as unsustainable? 40yrs doing the same thing every day at a company where no one likes you and becoming smooth brained only to die? For a future where the cost of living will very, very soon become astronomical and become unlivable? A future where blue collared workers, including engineers, are seen as small minded conservative bigots? I genuinely have these concerns, and only want to prepare not just for the next steps, but my entire to prevent catastrophe and a wasteful legacy.",

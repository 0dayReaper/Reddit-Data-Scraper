And depending on the company it's essentially an accomplishment that goes on a resume for future promotions etc.\n\nExternally it's a little trickier, but more or less the same, you just speak very generically about it.\n\nTypically companies aren't looking for you because you know/have *the* trade secret, in fact in my anecdotal experience they're generally pretty honest about avoiding that, as it's a good way to get into legal trouble.\n\nRather, they want the someone with the *skillset* to invent/document, implement/etc, things like trade secrets. If you can show something like \"implemented process for measuring xyz performance on widget abc\" without saying how you actually did it, that's enough. In theory the interview is enough to sort out if you're BSing or not. Once they believe you're honest and have that capability, that's where the benefit comes from.\n\nHopefully I answered your question.",

All of my work is under a blanket NDA that leaves me with being unable to discuss work outside of work (vendors, clients, design methodology, the whole way down). While I couldn't say exactly how I designed a solution to a design challenge I faced while working at [company], I can definitely expand on my personal methodology for determining a solution that can fit x, y, and z constraints.\n\nDo be careful about how your company is set up with non-disclosable information if you plan on taking on position in another internal department as some companies make this information department specific.\n\nBest of luck OP!\n\nSide note: a lot of NDA-covered material is pretty boring in reality, but sometimes it does end up being a major innovation",

            "comment": "I teach a little bit about intellectual property in my CS-300 class, so I can talk in general terms.   Standard disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, so don't take my advice.   (Talking to a lawyer that you've hired to advise you --- not one that works for your company --- might be in order here.)\n\n(clears throat professorially)\n\nThere are largely three ways to protect intellectual property: copyrights, patents, and trade secrets.   The former two are protected by many laws and regulations, and differ in a number of ways, but they have one thing in common: they require making the IP public, so that others can be inspired by the IP and produce new ideas.   \n\n\"Trade secrets\" have no formal status in law.  They are simply contractual agreements between various parties.    The parties in question agree to keep the content of the IP a secret, presumably with some financial incentive involved in maintaining the secret (e.g. a payment) and/or financial penalty involved if the secret is revealed (e.g. grounds for a civil lawsuit).\n\nSo, the benefits to you of having IP of yours declared a \"trade secret\" by your company are essentially dictated by the terms of whatever agreement you have with the company.   It may be that the IP is already the company's property (as \"work for hire\"), based on whatever employment agreements you've already signed, so your immediate  \"benefit\" is your salary.\n\nOn the one hand, as you note, having your work declared a \"secret\" limits how much you can talk about it --- with various degrees of secrecy, depending on the terms of the agreement.  \n\nOn the other hand, having your work deemed important enough to be worthy of trade secret protection is, itself, a sign of the importance of your work.   And you can probably(?) tell other people of the existence of the trade secret without revealing the content, so you can receive some public benefit from that recognition.   (Like in old spy movies ... \"I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you\", or \"I work for the government and I'm not allowed to talk about it.\")\n\nI had friends in graduate school who had summer jobs (like co-op jobs) in the intelligence community.   They said \"you'll never be famous, but you can be top-secret famous\" --- that is, recognized for your work within the tiny community of people allowed to know of your work.\n\nYes, it can be hard when seeking employment elsewhere if you are not able to speak of the work directly.  On the other hand, you might be able to get recommendation letters from your superiors that say \"I can't tell you what he did, but I can tell you it was important enough to protect it\", which is impressive.   And, also, your ability to keep secrets could be viewed as evidence of your moral character, because your refusal to reveal past secrets means that you're likely to preserve future secrets.\n\nI have no idea if I've answered your question.   (Which is typical for a professor, I suppose ...)",

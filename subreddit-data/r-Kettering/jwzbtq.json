What are my chances of getting in? And if I do get in, would it be worth it? I'm applying as a Mechanical Engineering major, since my dream is to be an automotive engineer.  \n\n\nEdit: I got in!",

It can be very difficult at times, bit I made a lot of great friends during my time there and I would say 85% of them are engineers in the auto industry. \n\nThat being said, you don't have to limit yourself to mechanical engineering to get in the automotive industry. Electrical engineers are needed too, especially with all of the autonomous driving and EV's that are being released. Mechanical is still a good place to be though! I graduated with my mechanical engineering degree in 2019.\n\nThe only downside for me was that I felt limited to a career the auto industry as a college student. I know that's your dream job, so that shouldn't be an issue for you! I'm in the process of getting my MBA right now and also pursuing opportunities in my dre industry, so it all worked out I guess! Good luck with you decision!",

You'll get in, you've got the chops for it.\n\nThat said, I'd make sure you have some sort of co-op opportunity either lined up on start or some sort of \"in\" into the company you want to work for.  If you don't have that, the co-op office should try to help you, but don't count on it, unless you live in an area that has high employment for auto engineers (aka Metro Detroit).  I'm from Saginaw and there's not much demand up there for anything unless you're looking at Nexteer.  And they pay garbage wages.\n\nIf you have the chops for it, I'd go EE or CE as that seems to be more in demand.\n\nEither way, make sure you have a super rock solid co-op job, because that makes or breaks the experience.  If you don't have a decent job that pays halfway decently, then you'll be stuck worrying about money while you're at school and won't be able to concentrate on classes.",

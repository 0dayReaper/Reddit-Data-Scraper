Im pretty sure i still got credit. I think its more so the school wants to keep tabs on the employers and avoid issues some students have previously mentioned on here. Basically an opportunity to get your opinion heard, i guess, kinda like prof reviews but idk for sure because like i mentioned before, i was never told to complete one.",

Three communications are sent to students and employer regarding evaluation completion.  If you are not receiving the communication, contact your Co-op Manager. Students must have five satisfactory co-ops in order to graduate.  Co-op is half of your academic requirements.",

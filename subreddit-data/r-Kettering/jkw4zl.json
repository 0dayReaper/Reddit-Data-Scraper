Worked part time throughout the entire year, full time during the summer, you get the work experience and don't have to pay outrageous tuition. Nothing this school provides seems worth the price.",

Many employers do not want a freshman or sophomore student versus a junior or senior for their summer roles.\n\nKettering has a vested interested in getting you employed from freshman year onwards - most of the students I see here aren't getting offers until their junior year, and freshman ones are hard to come by. The employers with Kettering are coming in wanting freshman knowing they'll ideally be with them long term (obviously many people switch co-ops).\n\nIf you're a really high achieving student, sure, you might have a comparable experience. For the average student, I don't think it's reasonable to assume you could get an internship freshman and sophomore year at many other insitutions.",

That said the people I've met here and the groups that I've associated with were worth it to me since I'm out of here without excessive student loans but I could've been 20k-30k ahead and in the positive going somewhere else so I believe kettering actually disadvantages it's students through rough coursework, absurd prices, and a degree that's only going to be recognized by people that went to the school. But at least we have a nice track record for completing projects on time now that the learning commons is open...",

The last undergraduate degree to be sunsetted by Kettering (before the current batch) was the Bioinformatics degree program in 2017, which was so small that nobody noticed when it was cancelled --- and anyone who really wanted the degree could easily move into one of the two parent programs.    Before then, you'd have to go back to the Manufacturing Systems Engineering degree program which was sunsetted in 2001.",

The demise of the Manufacturing Systems Engineering program in the aughts was more due to a conflict between the faculty and administration of the time than anything related to the program's viability.

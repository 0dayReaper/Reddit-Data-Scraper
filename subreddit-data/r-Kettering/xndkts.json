Suppose one was not expecting Blackboard to suddenly and immediately remove all their classes, preventing them from turning this thing in, unlike literally every other time where they waited, like, a week to remove the classes. Suppose one wished to know who the hell to contact about this.  \nWho would they go to?\n\nAsking for a friend.",

But I would suggest sending an email to [bblhelp@kettering.edu](mailto:bblhelp@kettering.edu) and asking for your access to be restored.   I have no idea if they will restore it or not, but they certainly have the authority to do so.\n\nI suspect your professors weren't expecting this either; I certainly wasn't.  It's one of the reasons I set my final deadlines for the course to be 11th Saturday noon, because that's the last possible moment of the term, and Blackboard access is supposed to be guaranteed through then.   (There was the term long ago when Kettering de-activated all the accounts for German exchange students at 12:01am Saturday when I had a paper deadline of 12:00pm Saturday, which was delightful to work out ...)\n\nBlackboard access to courses is supposed to be turned off after the course is \"over\", because of copyright issues.   In recent years, IT was lax/generous/whatever in turning off course access, and I suspect many folks simply got used to it.   I suspect (but have no proof) that converting Blackboard back to remote SaaS status may have re-instated the stricter deadline.",

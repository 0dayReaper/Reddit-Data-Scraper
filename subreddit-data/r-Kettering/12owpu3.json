Coaches and players alike are expected to and are held accountable for representing Kettering University with dignity and class. We expect the same high standards of behavior from all adults. Certain behaviors are considered inappropriate. Kettering Esports reserves the right to remove any person or bench any player who exhibits the following types of behavior: \n\n\u2022 Berating, humiliating or taunting the coaches or players \n\n\u2022 Berating or harassment of game officials, including referees and umpires \n\n\u2022 Profane, racist or sexist remarks directed at the coach, players, spectators or officials \n\n\u2022 Poor sportsmanship (i.e. Poor winning or losing)\n\n\u2022 Etc.\"\n\nSo these players in question willfully violated their agreement, and instead of terminating them on the spot, I wanted to give them the opportunity to turn it into a learning and growth opportunity.  \n\nEDIT: I want to make sure that the program at least maintains its integrity.  That's why we make sure to uphold academic standing and grade requirements, as well as issues like this.",

If nothing is changed by the new year, anyone would like to do a protest? Of course abiding by COVID mask and social distancing?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kakhet)",

I agree they do come back with answers for everything, but they sent it out due to the backlash and emails and comments and everything else we are doing. I do not believe our concerns are incorrect. I also think yes there should have been a training, there should be a terms and conditions give out to every single one of us. Have they sent that in the emails? no. Have they sent Honorlocks agreement? no. \nContacting Honorlock would be a mistake because they will not do anything, they are getting paid to run the software for the school. We attended Kettering university where we put out trust in to education and keep us safe, not honorlock. this is ketterings fault, and needs to be addressed at kettering.",

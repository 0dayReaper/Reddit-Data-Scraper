COVID-19 also has over double the transmittability (most likely higher due to a lack of testing infrastructure in affected areas) of the flu. Finally, it has a higher hospitalization rate as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPanic is not productive, but caution is. There is currently military triage happening in Italy, with doctors having to make ethical decisions about who gets treatment based on remaining duration and quality of life. The absolute worst thing anyone can do is downplay the seriousness of the scenario we are already balls deep in; followed closely by panicking and spreading mass hysteria.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell-informed decisions, cautious actions, and simply facing the fact that our lives will be fundamentally different for the next few months are steps it is critical we ALL take.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSauce:  [https://www.livescience.com/new-coronavirus-compare-with-flu.html](https://www.livescience.com/new-coronavirus-compare-with-flu.html)",

That means if you get the virus and, even before showing symptoms, you pass it to someone with prior respiratory issues or someone older than 50; including the relatives you may go home to when the term is over; that person has a significantly increased chance of death.\n\nI'm not saying that it won't make its way around and we won't all get it, because we probably will all have gotten sick by it at some point by the time a vaccine is developed and released. However, if we can decrease the rate at which it spreads, we would decrease he amount of people that have it at once, therefore decreasing the strain on hospitals and healthcare professionals and increasing the quality of care for those that end up being hospitalized.",

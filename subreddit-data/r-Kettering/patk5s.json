Based on the numbers, they should assign a classroom with an appropriate size and then social distance the students that want to attend in person. If students are vaccinated + socially distanced and there's limited attending in person, then i think the risk of a campus wide outbreak would be avoidable where literally everyone would be forced to go back to virtual whether they want to or not. \n\nBut idk how many students/faculty would agree to this either or if it's feasible",

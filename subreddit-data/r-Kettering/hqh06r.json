    "postText": "Will someone please start a petition to get the doors back to normal? Not only is it extremely inconvenient for everyone coming to and moving around campus, we already have the no touch tool and have to have the questionnaire done before we can do anything. Besides the doors in front of the CAMPUS SAFETY office are inaccessible in this situation. This poses an extreme safety issue in my eyes.",

            "comment": "Honestly they could probably just implement a system where your key-card doesn't work if you haven't answered 'no' to all the questions. I don't know how their card system works, but knowing as little as I know about programming, I don't think it would be hard to do something like that. Even if there's like some delay after answering the questions to gain access, imo it would still be preferable to this.\n\nI think another goal was to reduce touch points, but they would have propped open stairwell doors and limited exit doors too if that were the case.\n\nIf they did have to limit the doors, I will never understand why they chose the FIRST door in the basement. It's probably the least handicap-friendly of them all, not to mention the hike from the front of the building to the back, + the extra set of stairs that most students will have to climb. Call me lazy, but climbing stairs is a lot more taxing when you have a piece of fabric covering your breathing holes and all your classes were moved to the 4th floor.",

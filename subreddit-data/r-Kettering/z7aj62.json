    "postText": "TL;DR Common hour exams are harmful to students, don't equate to a fairer exam, and only benefit the professors who use them.\n\nProfessors at Kettering sometimes hold exams during common-hour in an attempt to curb cheating and ensure students are not disadvantaged by having a class earlier in the day or week and not advantaged by having a class later. The thought is that students will collaborate by sharing exam questions and answers between classes. This is a fair train of thought, and as an honest student at Kettering, I won\u2019t lie and say that this doesn't happen. However, I\u2019ll add that these problems can be addressed more effectively without the downsides of common hour exams.\n\nThe first problem with common-hour exams is that they prevent students from eating lunch if they have a class before common-hour. This is especially egregious because most students at Kettering are already skipping breakfast due to the demanding nature of the university. Late-night study sessions, particularly before exams, lead students to skip breakfast. This puts students in a situation where they have to choose between attending their class before common-hour or not eating a full meal before dinner. Even if a student does pack some kind of snack before the exam so they don\u2019t have to take the exam on an empty stomach, they are likely to pack less nutritious food like pop tarts or chips. The link between nutrition and test scores is well known in adolescents, and it stands to reason that this same link would exist for adult students. I understand that the goal is to prevent later classes from having an advantage over earlier classes due to breaches in academic integrity, but common-hour exams simply push the disparity onto a different group of students. This isn\u2019t even to mention students who have club meetings or student government meetings during common-hour. While missing one meeting might not seem like much, with only 10 or fewer meetings a term, a single common-hour exam means that everyone in that class could be missing 10% of the meetings for the term. In addition, there is no buffer zone for the common hour block of class scheduling. Meaning if a student has a class before common-hour they must either leave their class early or be late for the exam. Likewise, if the student requires the full hour to complete their exam and they have a class after the common-hour exam they will be late to that class. Classe schedules are blocked the way they are for good reason and common hour exams are in violation of the principle that Kettering itself has set.\n\nSo common hour exams cause numerous problems for students. How can academic integrity be ensured? Well, to that, I would say we could follow the vast majority of professors at Kettering\u2019s example. Exam questions can have different numbers, so sharing answers becomes pointless. They can be varied further to test different concepts as well so that sharing the exam questions becomes pointless as well. While this can lead to grumbles among the student body because they might argue their questions were more difficult than other classes, but it at least puts the disparity on the knowledge of the student. I am, unfortunately, not a professor, but 90% of professors at Kettering have found strategies for providing fair exams while maintaining academic integrity without using common hour exams, and would be able to provide more advice on how to ensure exams are as fair as possible.\n\nA cost/benefit analysis clearly leads us to the conclusion that common-hour exams are harmful to students. The only beneficiary of common hour exams is the professor who hosts a common hour exam because they only have to proctor a single hour-long exam instead of multiple. That is not to say that professors who hold common hour exams are bad professors or are purposefully hurting their students, but I do believe that their reasoning is flawed on this matter. I hope we can all move to a more productive learning environment and remove common-hour exams for everyone.\n\nEDIT: If you are feeling the same way as I was when I wrote the above essay, please see the nearly equally long (if not longer) comment below as to why I was incorrect. Have a great day!",

            "comment": "So, as the resident loud-mouthed professor here, let me offer some constructive feedback. \n\nWinston Churchill once famously said that \"democracy is the worst form of government ever invented, except for all the others that have been tried\".   I feel that way about just about every exam format that's ever been proposed, including common-hour exams.  I'm not going to argue that common-hour exams are the best possible exam format.   But the alternatives aren't necessarily much better.\n\nSo, responding to your critiques (in no particular order):\n\n* It's unfair to say that 90% of professors can provide fair exams without using common-hour exams, because 90% of professors don't teach multi-section courses where a common-hour exam is even a consideration.    Basically, this is only applicable to early science &amp; math courses, and (of course) ME.  \n* Your concern regarding skipping lunch is completely valid.  Of course, it's only a problem if you have a course right before AND right after common hour.   Granted, that's a non-trivial number of students, but it's not every student.  It would be interesting to know exactly how many students are affected in this way (alas, I have no idea how you'd figure this out).\n* At the same time, you're a little quick to imply \"well, students skip breakfast when they shouldn't, but it's still primarily the professor's fault for holding the exam during lunch\".   Students need to exercise a little responsibility for their own health, too.\n* Common-hour exams are supposed to be 50 minutes in length, to allow time to transition to/from classes.   If your instructor is given 60-minute exams during common hour, that's a problem that you should take up with those who can do something about it.   (And that shouldn't require a campus-wide petition to fix.)\n* You grossly underestimate the ease with which an instructor can create equivalent exams --- at least for all subjects.  Sure, a calculus exam can be made unique by \"changing the numbers\".   But there are no numbers on CS exams.   Substituting different questions yields a different exam, and it's **extremely** difficult to ensure that the different versions of the exam have equal difficulty, so that the grade received is fair to all.    (Trust me on this; I tried hard to due this during the hybrid year, and it was horribly difficult, and terribly constraining.)\n* Asking professors to take advice from their colleagues on how to construct fairer assessments is much more difficult than you think.  I'm not sure how the communications faculty can advise me on how to write a fair CS exam.  And I wouldn't want to advise them on how to write a fair communications exam.   Transferring expertise between disciplines is extremely hard.   (Again, trust me on this; during the hybrid year, I was attending every webinar I could find on how to teach effectively online, and most of the advice I found simply wouldn't work in my courses.)\n* Your assertion that the only person who benefits from a common-hour exam is the instructor is unfair.  As you note, a common-hour exam reduces the possibilities of cheating, which benefits all students.  Also, a single exam form can be graded more consistently than multiple exam forms, which benefits all students.\n* During A-section, I attended a KSG Academic Council forum (during lunch!).  The A-section AC reps there were actually arguing for **more** common-hour exams, because certain multi-section courses (ME?) don't use common-hour exams, even if the sections are taught by different instructors, and students were receiving wildly different educational experiences from those instructors.   Common-hour exams were viewed as a means to force those instructors to work together to develop a common set of topics, which would force the instructors to more-or-less teach the same things in the same order.   Personally, I don't think that would help much (and would harm a lot).   But you need to be aware that there is a group of students arguing for exactly the opposite of what you're seeking.\n* There are other alternatives, of course, and maybe we should be looking at some of them.   Back in the dark ages, when I was a college student (at another institution), common exams were scheduled during the evenings.  Of course, evening exams have the same problems as mid-day exams; they interfere with meals, other scheduled courses, and campus life events.   But would they interfere less than mid-day exams?\n* Or, of course, we could just do away with exams entirely.   Of course, what would we replace them with?   My superiors seem obsessed with creating more grading checkpoints, not fewer.  (Midterm grades, Early midterm grades, ... I'm waiting for someone to propose Double Early midterm grades ...).  \n* Hey, we could adopt the European model.   No homework, no quizzes, no midterm exams.   The final exam is worth 100% of your course grade.   No, this isn't a strawman; European universities run on this model.   But I don't think anyone wants that kind of pressure on the final exam.\n* Or, maybe, just maybe, we could develop an academic culture at Kettering where instructors could give the same exam at different times during the day, and students would agree not to share information about the exam between sections.   But that would require a complete revamping of Kettering student culture --- and y'all would have to do that yourselves.   At the very least, y'all could quit blaming faculty for trying to combat the academic dishonesty y'all encourage (or at least tolerate).\n\nThis comes across as unduly harsh, and that's not my intention here.   But if you're going to use this document as a starting point for a discussion with Kettering administrators, you need to consider the counterarguments.\n\nG.K. Chesterton famously said: \"don't take down a fence until you understand why it was put up in the first place\".  If you're going to attack common-hour exams, you should at least understand why they're viewed, by many faculty, as a necessary evil.\n\nFull disclosure: I haven't given a common-hour exam in probably 15-20 years, because I fall into that category of instructors teaching only mono-section courses.",

I hope that it didn't come off as too much of an attack on any faculty, but in hindsight, it might have. \n\nObviously, the issue is more complex than I assumed, and my winging, when compared with your well worded comment, falls apart.\n\nI will say that some of your critiques were unfounded for at least some common-hour exams. The only common-hour exams I took were in classes with exams that, in my opinion, could be easily changed to accommodate not being a common-hour exam. At least in terms of my original \"changing the numbers\" comment. \n\nFor clarification, I will say that I should have been more clear when I talked about professors collaborating to find solutions that don't involve common hour exams I wasn't referring to interdepartmental collaboration, just within their own respective departments. \n\nThat said, I have a couple of other minor grumbles about your comment, but as a whole, I consider the matter above my pay grade in terms of complexity and scope. I also have been convinced that there is enough of an argument for common-hour exams to justify them staying. Therefore I won't be escalating this any further than it already is. \n\nI won't delete the post because I know I am not the only one who feels/felt the way I did when I wrote it, so hopefully, other students will take the time to read your comment as I have.\n\nHave an excellent day, and thank you again!",

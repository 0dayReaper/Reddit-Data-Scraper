But we can't change anything that is out of our control but what we CAN do is try our best in the classes, put forth the effort, and then relax and take a deep breath. \n\nWhenever i have major anxiety about school issues, i always think if theres anything I can do, if there is something, I try to do it to the best of my ability; however, if theres nothing I can do, i just try to live one minute (yes, I said minute, and not day) at a time. \n\nIts difficult to do than me just talking about doing it, but if you need to talk, me and all the other students are here for you :)",

I moved out of dorms as soon as I heard about covid cases in Michigan and I was kinda shocked at how KU handled the living arrangements early in 2020 for Thompson Hall.\n\nAs for mental health, yes, its very important to do what you feel comfortable in. Reducing the level of stress you have even by a little is better. I also prefer living at home than in the campus atmosphere for this reason as well. It doesn't make the classes easier, but some changes make them easier to cope with, if that makes sense. \n\nPersonally concerned about the level of material the professors will be teaching. Last term, some of the profs put a ridiculous amount of problems and time limit was definitely not enough. So situations like that are worrisome",

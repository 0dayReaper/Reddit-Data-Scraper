            "comment": "Ruben is FANTASTIC for HIGH-LEVEL courses only.  He\u2019s a theoretical (read: pure) mathematician by trade and will explain the history of the methods along with their implementation, which he explains generically (for example, he will give you the quadratic formula without ever doing an example with numbers).  If you can extrapolate to the use case (or you\u2019re taking Abstract Algebra) this is perfect.  If you aren\u2019t: well, there ain\u2019t no brakes.",

On one hand, my body would often go into fight-or-flight mode when I had to do math problems in front of everybody on the whiteboard. On the other hand, it really increased my understanding to have the instructor there coaching me through problems.\n\nI learned more from him than I did from Hennicken in Calc I. Then again, I had a small class and it was II-X, so...",

He also doesn't like crumpled homework or edges of papers from notebooks. Good for learning terrible for passing the class. Basically the opposite of the you feel like you know nothing but manage to pass many other Kettering profs are like.",

            "comment": "Tbh, I feel like hes doing better than most profs in the online environment but he hasn't given any tests yet to know for sure. He seems to go in depth with the lessons, and does a bunch of examples. I know a lot of the students feel like hes just reading off the notes but the alternative to this is him writing on the board and us not hearing anything. Also, if you ask him at any point on any question for a part you dont understand, he goes over it (no matter how \"dumb\" you feel the question is). He responds to emails fairly quickly and writes out in detail if you are confused on the topic. \n\nMy only suggestion is that take time out of the week and solely focus on the class and do the problems multiple times so you get more efficient and start noticing patterns. Remember, it's always laplace...unless it isnt....\n\nPlus, his exams are online. Unlike other profs in my classes which are having us come in to take them during a pandemic :/",

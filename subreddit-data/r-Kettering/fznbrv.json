    "postText": "Hello all I am an incoming freshman to Kettering University. I am assigned to B section but I was also given a choice to switch to A section due to Co-op. I am super excited to start here at Kettering but have a few questions regarding section selection,Greek life, social atmosphere.\n\n1. Should I stay in B section or Switch to A Section?  What are the pros and cons of each as well as differences in personality?\n2. What are each of the fraternities Like? (IE, partiers/nerds/athletes)\n3. What Should I expect from rush?\n4. Does Kettering have parties? If so what are they Like. \n5. What sorts of things are there to do on campus in your free time?\n6. Expectations for Incoming Freshman and Advice.",

            "comment": "1. As an asection alumni I say asection is better. You get to be at school during the summer when there\u2019s a lot more going on. Plus, you\u2019ll get to be at your co-op during all the good holidays. From what I understand asection is a bit more tame than bsection is party wise. I think it has to due with when you start school. Getting the first summer off (if you don\u2019t start your co-op) versus moving into the dorms a month after graduating high school. \n\n2. This is a hard question really to answer. Some like the Beta\u2019s are more academically focused and dry, others such as Sigs throw parties, Pike\u2019s have a focus on athletics, but there\u2019s a mix of people in all of them. I was Greek and my house was dry, but I definitely partied. We just don\u2019t shit where we live. \n\n3. Honestly, it varies by house. Free food and some interesting things to do.\n\n4. Yes, sausage fests, but fun. \n\n5. Honestly not much besides the rec center. Some people put up hammocks on the beach and hang out, but nothing organized. \n\n6. Kettering is a difficult school so take time to relax and decompress. Take time to explore Flint too. There\u2019s a ton of hidden gems like Good Beans Cafe.  \n\nFeel free to pick my mind. I\u2019m happy to help with an questions you might have.",

            "comment": "There is basically a fraternity for any type of person. So, more likely than not, you will find one you like. Taking the time to just talk to people on campus is a good first step.\n\nThere are scheduled rush events. You will find out more details about that in time. It is really fun, lots of great events.\n\nKettering has parties, just not as frequently as state schools. From my experience, they are fun. People at Kettering are really kind and friendly so that helps. I would avoid going to one for the first few weeks so that you can adjust to the demanding academics.\n\nIn your *limited* free time, there are a lot of great clubs to join. Don\u2019t commit to one your first semester, take the time to explore them.\n\nFor incoming freshman, I would say the expectations are reason. Here is some advice. \nNever get behind, ever. This will make the rest of the semester a nightmare. Just stay on top of things and you\u2019ll do fine.\nGo to office hours, profs are usually very happy to help you understand a concept you are struggling with. It is best practice to go in with specific questions. Study groups and the free tutoring services also help.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to shoot me a DM.",

            "comment": "I'm not involved with any Greek life, but from a section standpoint, every section thinks they are better a good chunk of the time. One advantage with A Section is the fact all the memes posted here seem to be from A section. \n\nStarting in the summer isnt too bad, with the way work term is, you are almost never commuting in very bad weather to work. The SAE garage is more alive I've heard on A Section if that's something you're interested in. You graduate a little sooner with A Section since you start a little sooner, and based off the way your schedule is, your last term is a work term, so as long as you completed all your thesis work/ requirements to graduate, you can start working sooner.\n\nJust keep ontop of your homework. Meet people, make friends and connections. If you know the right people, you'll never have to pay for a text book due to large libraries of PDFs (and paper copies in certain cases), typically managed by fraternities from what I know.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior currently and I\u2019ve ran into some concerns with continuing at Kettering. My main concern is the notoriety of Kettering outside of Michigan and the automotive industry. Would a company like Apple, Google, Tesla, etc. even take the time to look into the university? I\u2019m concerned that the lack of notoriety will cause my applications to be overlooked in the future. Would I be better off transferring out to a school like Michigan State or U of M? If anyone has some first hand experience, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Reasonable recruiters don't throw out non-Ivy League applications, they look for people with an edge over others.\n\nIf your coop sucks and doesn't give you that chance, find a new one or move schools - because Kettering's academics are part of why everyone says \"the coop program\" when you ask them why they went to Kettering.",

What school appears on the degree matters far less then people make it seem.",

I barely know crap about software engineering, but I know that the reason I got interviews was because of the co-op program. After that, passing them is just completely on you. Unless your co-op sucks, I think you'll be able to get noticed. I just wish we could get tech companies directly at Kettering instead of only automotive.",

I would hate working at a huge company like tesla or GM or something but if that's what you want then go for it. I do have to say though, I transferred into Kettering as a junior and let me tell you, transferring is a real pain in the ass and you need to expect to spend more time in undergrad if you do transfer. Also Kettering was one of the better schools to me in the whole transferring process if that carries any weight.",

Not because of jobs/companies, but solely because of how awful our upper level classes are. If you think you have had unreasonable professors and difficult classes early on, senior level courses crank that shit up to 11. Get out if the option is available to you. If you do decide to stay, listen to which professors people tell you to avoid, the things you hear are true.",

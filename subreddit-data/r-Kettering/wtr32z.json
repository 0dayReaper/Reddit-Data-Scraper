You only have a true college experience once; a graduate degree or another undergrad cannot replicate your first, wholly immersed experience, and there are some opportunities you can only seize as a young college student.",

There likely will be others in your class. It won't affect your career negatively. Even less than other schools because you can still gain more co-op experience.",

Since you called it an essential class I\u2019m gonna assume that taking it somewhere else isn\u2019t possible\n\nI would go for it, just keep in mind certain scholarships only last a certain number of terms so you might not have your current scholarships helping you financially for that extra year\n\nBasically the only downside is the money part but it should relieve a lot of stress",

    "postText": "I've done groupchats as an SI for the past few terms with GroupMe. Some went great, some were useless. Im doing a winter term SI for MATH 204 Cheng and Salacuse (normally I only do B section). Since Salacuse's class in particularly has struggled cause hes an awful professor, I know a group chat would help them. \n\nI was wondering if Discord would be a better platform instead of GroupMe? I feel like it's become more popular and might be preferred by other students. As people who have SIs, what do you think is better? And would you find a groupchat beneficial? \n\n(Note - I use them so people can ask questions to me and to one another. As well as vent/complain about the class cause it's a viable outlet lol)",

I was also playing around with discord and I can set up a separate channel (idk if thats the right word, im too tired lol) to pop in all my resources. So like lesson plans, recordings, derivative/integral cheat sheets, etc. Might be nice to have on hand like that.",

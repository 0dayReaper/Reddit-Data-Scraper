            "comment": "I switched co-ops after my first term (B section, so I had 1 co-op term in, and found a new employer during my first academic term). I played their game, jumped through all the hoops, and they agreed to *allow* me to switch if I did one more term with my current co-op, and then started with the new on in the summer. \n\nAfter I got my offer, the new employer was adamant that I start in January. When I stopped in to the co-op office, both my old co-op manager and my new co-op manager gave me the green light to accept the new job anyways. The old co-op manager even gave me a list of things to mention in my call to my old employer for when I quit. Figuring everything was okay, I called my old co-op and told them I was quitting.\n\nFast forward to the next week, I get a NASTY email from my old co-op manager accusing me of going behind her back. This is despite me seeking their approval at every step of the way. \n\ntl;dr: Just apply for the jobs you want and don't bother going through the co-op department. Even if you do, they will still try to blame you. They're gatekeepers with no real power - exactly zero employers give a shit about whether you are \"cleared for re-assignment\" or whatever they call it these days.",

I had it for two terms, and it was a shit show.\n\nCo-op manager told me I had to quit my job to get any help from them finding a new one. I told her \"that's now how the real world works\" and she basically never responded. Found a new job the old fashioned way through networking. Co-op manager and my new one found out that I had found a new job and was trying to accept before quitting my old job and got super pissed. I still had months before the start of the next co-op term and was planning on quitting my old job when the new one was a sure thing. Like the real world. Despite explaining all this and that if they were in my position, they'd never quit their job before getting a new one, still got an email saying if I ever did it again I'd be suspended.\n\nNothing ever happened. That whole department is beyond useless. Every meeting with them I had was always so complicated and rarely resulted in me being better off than I was.\n\nTL;DR: 100% agree",

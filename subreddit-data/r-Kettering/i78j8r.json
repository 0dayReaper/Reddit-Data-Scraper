    "postText": "With this term being so manic should Kettering provide a pass/fail option again. \n\nStudents are being put back and forth in quarantine every other week. Half the time teachers are experiencing technical difficulties, which are no one's fault, but classes are getting canceled because of them. I just feel that if  2 weeks online over winter term was ground for a pass/fail option maybe we should start a discussion with administration about the possibility for this term.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/i78j8r)",

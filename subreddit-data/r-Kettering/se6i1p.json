I feel like topics like this never go into the circumstances that those who disagree are waiting for/want to be met before masks become optional. It just turns into a hate filled comment section with no mature debate only statement of beliefs. I\u2019m interested to hear the thoughts of students as well as professors. Again I\u2019d prefer to keep it civil. Thanks",

For reference, Genesee County is reporting a daily case rate of 185/100K and a positivity rate of 35%.\n\nSo what would it take for me to feel comfortable without a mask?\n\n* Case rates going WAY down. \n* A vaccine + booster mandate for everyone (students, faculty, staff) with only *legit* medical exemptions.\n* Moving all classes outdoors.\n\nAnd exactly none of those options is going to happen.\n\n* Case rates going down is out of Kettering's control.\n* Kettering has made it abundantly clear that they're not going to mandate vaccines --- even though every other major university in the region has done so.   Mandates work; UM mandates vaccines and boosters, and UM's vaccination rate is around 98%.\n* I teach CS, so an outdoor class setting (even if it wasn't winter) is not an option.\n\nSo the only option I really have is to hunker down and hope my loved ones and I don't get sick before this virus finishes killing off 10 million people around the world.",

Yeah they're probably going to be positive.  But if only 10% get tested, and of that 10% there is a 38% positivity rate t that means only 3.8% of the population are positive.  \nBasically what I'm saying is the positivity rate is a skewed sample set that is not indicative of the population as a whole.",

It's only really when those numbers drop that you have to see if enough testing is going on to justify a lesser level of concern.",

Public health officials then take those reports and investigate them to determine what connection, if any, the adverse reaction has with the vaccine.\n\nThe problem with allowing the general public to view these reports is that they're uninvestigated and unverified.   Suppose I get vaccinated in the morning, then decide to buy and eat gas station sushi for dinner, then spend the rest of the night vomiting.  Do I blame the vomiting on the sushi or the vaccine?   Technically, I don't know, so I can report it on VAERS, because my vomiting spell happened after I got vaccinated.    VAERS has a lot of those kinds reports.\n\nThe database is public because it's sometimes hard to track these sorts of vaccine reactions in isolation and see if there are any patterns.   Also, the database is public because if it was private, folks would be screaming about how the Evil Government is trying to hide something.   \n\nSo, public health officials collect all of those reports and investigate them, because they have to.  (Not unlike the way that police departments have to investigate every school shooting threat, even though most of them aren't credible.)   And they absolutely should investigate them.  A dear friend of mine cannot yet be vaccinated because of a life-threatening allergy to one of the preservatives being used in all three major vaccines; her medical team is reviewing the VAERS data (among other sources) to try and find a possible vaccination regimen that would confer immunity without killing her.\n\nI know it's really popular among (\\*ahem\\*) certain media sources to report on the raw VAERS numbers as if they're significant.   But they're simply not meaningful without interpretation and investigation.\n\nTL;DR: *post hoc ergo propter hoc* is a logical fallacy, and most people reading VAERS numbers are falling prey to that fallacy.",

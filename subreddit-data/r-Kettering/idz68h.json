Some of you worry way too much about your gpa when your employer will be more impressed with your school/work experience than some number. At the end of the day, just do your best and the results will follow. Choose your battles correctly, some classes are just going to be hard no matter what, but do well in the easy ones and everything will be fine.",

Some professors are not recording classes, and they take attendance through blackboard, so if your connection is bad, then you're fucked. Plus some of them don't record their lectures. It's not about if YOU think it's necessary or not. It's about the people whose blackboard keeps failing and not letting them into the collab session for 45 minutes. Also everyone has different learning styles and learning abilities. So if you don't need it, then cool, don't use it, but at least let other people have THE OPTION to get a pass/fail.\nAlso, I dunno if you're aware, but many employers ask for a minimum GPA, so if some people are having trouble with online classes, then I think it's best of they can keep their GPA.",

And while pass/fail won't prevent someone from failing, it does help them to not have their GPA affected because of technical or unforseen issues about how a professor is handling their own situation in their lectures.\n\nAlso, who mentioned anything about financial/personal issues? You don't know what other people are going through right now, and I don't think it's fair to just assume that everyone is wired like you are and just say: \"oh you can't do it? Well boo-hoo, I can and screw you\"\n\nI, personally, don't need the pass/fail, but some of my friends do. And I am advocating for them because I don't want to see them struggle with their co-ops or scholarships. We are all already going through hard times, why put people through more? Once we go back to fully being on campus they can get rid of the pass/fail option. But due to current world circumstances I think it's in the best interest of everyone to keep it as an option.",

Maybe I\u2019m biased going into my last semester and just want to get my degree over with, but I\u2019ve been in the trenches here so I know what it takes to get through some of these classes. I also had to already do a full online semester last B-section, so I know how it is and how much it sucks. I went into last semester with 20 credits and came out with 16. I made a decision early in the semester that I wasn\u2019t going to do well in one of my classes so I accepted that and dropped it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my other classes weren\u2019t a piece of cake either, but I grinded through them and made it out alive. \n\nSometimes you just have to accept that not everything is going to go your way. No disrespect to anyone but Kettering doesn\u2019t owe you anything and they are going to drill that into your head every semester you come back. The classes are difficult and 75% of the professors really don\u2019t give a shit if the class makes any sense and if you pass or not. If you\u2019re having it rough, there is always someone who is having it even rougher. Either suck it up and figure it out or move on.\n\nI also understand the financial issues some of you may have. I\u2019m not poor but my friends like to remind me that I\u2019m not rich. When classes went online, my $90 laptop I bought off a friend my freshman year decided it was time to call it a career and left me. 90% of my co-op wages goes to paying tuition so buying a new laptop was a tax. Luckily though, Kettering offered the Covid Relief Fund and helped pay for a new one. The fund is there for everyone and if you\u2019re not taking advantage of it then you\u2019re just dumb. Books, desk, lost wages from on-campus work, computer/laptop, rent, and a bunch of other things can all be covered up to $1,800 which is just the highest amount I\u2019ve heard of but could be more. \n\nIn the end, some of you just like to complain and not do anything rather than take action (Maybe not you if you\u2019re reading this). I sympathize for those of you with legitimate issues but I know some people just want to take advantage of the pass/fail system and get through the class the laziest way possible. To each their own, this is just my opinion.",

First off, your statement of \"I knew I wasn't going to do well in a course, so I dropped it,\" isn't something that we all can afford the luxury of doing. There are classes that Kettering offers that are only offered every other year, and even worse, those are often prerequisites for something else, or are requirements for a concentration which ultimately end up pushing your exit from this place even further back.   \n\n\nSecond, your statement that Kettering doesn't owe us anything is bullshit. We pay this place to provide us with a service, with an education, something that some of these online classes barely provide (repeatedly missing 30+% of the audio due to technical issues in an unrecorded lecture doesn't really help me learn anything, now does it). Kettering failed to provide the service which we all paid for, and as a result, we have the right to demand some sort of compensation for it (ie, a pass/fail).   \n\n\nLastly, regarding people abusing pass fail, I see people skate through this place every single day on nothing more than a collection of old cribs and Chegg. The lazy people who don't want to put the effort into a class and who would abuse a pass/fail system are the exact same people who barely put any effort into this stuff in the first place anyway. Even if somebody isn't a slacker and uses pass fail to just glide through a class, they're still setting themselves up personally for failure down the road.   \n\n\nPersonally, I have no use for a pass/fail system as a Senior 3 with one foot out the door, and who has worked his ass off to succeed in this place, but I do understand how having the pass/fail option would be beneficial to some students, whether it be to keep scholarships, keep their co-op position (an extremely rare commodity anymore), fraternity/sorority requirements or just so that they don't end up on academic probation because some professor who has 2Kbps internet failed them for not being able to understand the pile of garbage that ended up on that student's computer screen.",

Idk, there is enough time and opportunity at this school to make up a class or take one online that you should be able catch up. \n\nI entirely believe in my statement that Kettering doesn\u2019t owe us anything. To me, your statement is the same thing as saying life owes you something for just being alive. Sure, you pay to go to this school, but you could\u2019ve gone to any other school as well. Maybe the class audio does suck and you don\u2019t learn as much leading you to getting a worse grade, but is pass/fail the compensation you\u2019re really looking for? Get angry at the school you choose to go and seek ways to improve it by reaching out. There are plenty of ways to do so. Maybe they\u2019ll read one of your\u2019s and your classmate\u2019s 20 reviews and think about changing it. Or maybe they won\u2019t and we\u2019ll continue to have the same problems. All I know is that if the class completely sucked, and I couldn\u2019t have done anything different myself, that a simple pass/fail wouldn\u2019t make me feel any better. \n\nI do understand why having the system in place to help people with keeping scholarships and the rest, but the academic probation part is dumb. One professor alone isn\u2019t going to put you at risk, if you\u2019re on or will be going on academic probation then that\u2019s a personal issue. You can\u2019t tell me more than half your professors are having bad enough connection issues to warrant possibly going on academic probation. The rest of that was fine though.",

Myself, and many of my colleagues, have attempted to communicate with the administration, to no avail.\n\nYou are correct, one professor is highly unlikely to put you on academic probation, but it is still a possibility for some, especially those just on the threshold.

This is also my last year, and I just want to graduate... but that doesn't mean that I don't care about everyone else in this school.\nIf you were in Spring term taking online classes, then you know people had the option to keep their grades or take a pass/fail.\nLike you said: \"If you\u2019re having it rough, there is always someone who is having it even rougher.\"\nSo, why want the people who are having it rougher even worse?\nI get it, it's frustrating when there are people who are lazy and just take the pass/fail... but you've got to realize that most people \"having it rougher\" are the ones taking the pass/fail.\n\nSo, agree to disagree buddy.",

Sure, you might save yourself a C or D from your transcript, but I would rather just take the grade. Then there\u2019s the case where if you wanted to go for your graduate degree that the school could want you to retake the class anyways. If everyone else wants pass/fail ,then by all means keep it implemented, I just don\u2019t care for it.\n\nI should ask though, why would you/they need to stay one or two more semesters. Kettering allows you to take 2 classes out and there are enough semesters where you could squeeze in extra classes if you needed to. Taking the semester off wouldn\u2019t cost any money, and sure you would be behind your classmates, but if it is necessary then so be it.",

The reason for staying one or two more terms is because not all classes are offered every term. Some of them are offered every other year, some of them are offered summer/fall term or winter/spring term. Also, it's not like you can bring in any transfer credits. Registrar only allows transferring gen-eds unless you are taking some classes abroad. Also, you have to take into account that you are available to attend the university you are being a guest at either in person or online. So if you don't find an online version, good luck with finding a school that's within you co-op driving distance or school housing distance...\n\nAnd good! Why didn't you start with the \"if everyone wants to keep it implemented, then keep it, I don't care\" since the beginning!? Lol",

Personally, I just don\u2019t think anyone or thing owes anyone anything, even if you payed for it. Life is unfair and you\u2019ve got to make the best of it otherwise where is the challenge in it? Whether you agree with that or not is up to you but it\u2019s whatever really. And if you\u2019re on the threshold of probation then I do think it\u2019s personal right at this point because classes just switched to online and if your issues stemmed from in personal classes then that is your fault. If this was a year from now. and classes were still online, then I could see that argument being valid. Anyways, hopefully the survey works and we get pass/fail, I don\u2019t need it but I hope whoever does gets it.",

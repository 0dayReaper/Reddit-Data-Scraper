I'll give you the benefit of the doubt though. Just as there is truth in non-fiction such as statistics and biographies, there is also a level of truth in fiction and comedy. Even if you allegedly wrote it in a sarcastic tone, you clearly meant: \"Why watermark a meme seen by 10 people and understood by less\", to which I responded accordingly.\n\nBut, lets dig a little deeper. You're clearly a middle-aged man, obsessed with a few hundred pixels of a meme, from an entirely satirical account, on a sub meant for 20-year-olds. \n\nSound pathetic? You guessed it.\n\nGet back to building Legos champ",

This meme is the visual equivalent of a muffled, distorted recording of several people talking over each other.\n\nNot to mention that you put the text under the picture it was *supposed* to point at, so it looks like it's actually pointing at the watermark. The watermark actually makes this meme less intelligible. Bad design all around.",

Whereas in a test setting, the higher level of worry might make yoh forget concepts, methods, etc. \n\nTry asking her if she can give you practice quizzes or you can try to give yourself a \"mock quiz\". Treat it like a real one and dont use notes or anything. And then notice where you really end up struggling. \n\nAnd lastly, definitely reach out to her. She's a prof so im sure shes helped students in your situation before :) \n\nGood luck!!",

She was trained under Professor Jeff Hargrove and Diane Peters. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is she was trained by nice/effective professors and she\u2019s great herself. I have had her for two labs.\n\nShe will help you if you reach out and be better than any of us.",

Now the wellness center has it on record that I have ADHD and profs have to meet certain accomodations based on my info. In general the accomodations (not for me but in general, this is a total blanket statement) extra time on exams, ability to record all lectures, an alternative testing location, etc. \nIm not at all saying you have ADHD, just sharing my experience and acknowledging that it might be worth looking into.",

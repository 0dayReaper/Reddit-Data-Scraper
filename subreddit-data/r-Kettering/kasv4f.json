    "postText": "The memo that was sent out talks about how IT was consulted on what kind of proctoring software to use. But there is literally no way IT would approve something like HonorLock. There are other, much less invasive proctoring software.\n\nOr to get around cheating since that's what this is really about, teachers could always randomize questions to a degree instead of giving literally the same exact test and I don't mean what some teachers have done where its the same questions, but randomize the order. \n\nHeck a better way of doing it is to have students join an individual group in blackboard, have their camera/mic on since blackboard already requests that when we join a virtual classroom. The teacher could just periodically join a students group and just make sure they aren't breaking the honor code.",

He LETS us use google, and instead makes the questions harder, or something we have to think about, making the test based around what we know AND the resources available to us. That way it's much harder to cheat in an online classroom. I wish my ME professors would do the same.",

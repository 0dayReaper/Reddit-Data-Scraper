I hear everyone complaining about him (and it might be rightfully so, he could be the worst professor at the school for all I know), but few people are actually giving us reasons as to why he's a bad prof. What about his tests are bad? Why is his teaching style trash? What unreasonable grading has he done? All I hear is \"I hate the dude\" and that's all I'm seeing in the evaluation. Not really helpful if you ask me.",

That's an odd requirement, especially considering most profs would rather let students who did well in the class skip the exam given they already demonstrated their knowledge of the material. I wish more of these types of details were out and about, because it just seems like everyone craps on Kaiser, and with no kind of context, it gets really old to hear about him all the time.",

He\u2019d get half way through and get confused, then look at us like we knew how to solve it and just stop. He made hybrid problems, he\u2019d scour the internet to find tests from MIT and Ivy Leagues then take the hardest part of every problem then put those on the tests. The only way to get an A in the class was to be able to solve problems he didn\u2019t teach you how to solve. He has no desire to see his students succeed, absolutely none, and in the rare case that they do he takes all the credit. \n\nThis has turned into a long rant but, tldr; I\u2019d shove a cactus in every orifice if it meant never having to see that crazy dude again",

Plus the rec\u2019s times are pretty whack for doing anything in the morning. \n\nFrom 3-5 you can get gold easier than food, like dog, I\u2019m hungry. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how this is will do anything besides be a nuisance.",

Even before the pandemic, BJ's was pretty much the only thing open late enough to entertain eating from. \n\nif you want food, you have to either: \n\n- drive to one of the nearby Meijers for groceries and cook everything yourself. \n\n- Drive to get takeout. Most of the good places are west of I-75. Mega diner is a good one. \n\n- some combination of the above.\n\nIf you don't have wheels, I'm sorry but you're fucked.",

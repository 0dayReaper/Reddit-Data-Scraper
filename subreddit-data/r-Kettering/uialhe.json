There are still misses here or there, but there's usually always at least something that's edible unless you have some sort of strict dietary requirement. The only thing that consistently sucks is the sunrise dining hours, since each meal they're really only open for about two hours at a time and if you miss that you're out of luck",

No cafeteria - you can take the food wherever you want. And I think they said the drinks were going to be free and in the common space. \n\nThey said the new company is Michigan based, with a lot of local farms and suppliers in the food chain. Even showed off a wood-fired pizza oven. If the facilities are any clue when it opens (they said Summer term) food should be d totally different - not just edible but actually like a place you will want to eat. We\u2019ll see - but it looked promising.\n\nThere is a full coffee shop on there too on the second floor separate from the kitchen - espresso, food, etc.",

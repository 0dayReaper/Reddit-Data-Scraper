If you're trying to be a mask karen and you don't wear what the cdc recommends, then I'm not going to take a single thing you say seriously.\n\nI never mentioned anything about a mask being a muzzle or mentioned anything about how they work. You're projecting that onto me and it tells me a lot about you from that comment alone. I don't care if you don't think I'm a decent human being, you can suck my toes.",

I sure as hell have no desire to wear one, I haven't had to wear one for over 18 years of my life. I've personally had covid and it sucks dick, but I still prefer to not wear a mask. I'm not denying that they may be useful, I just have no desire to wear one, even after experiencing covid.\n\nIf I had to be somewhere sick then I'd put one on to be a reasonable person, but if I'm not sick then I'm not going to act like I am.

If a new variant comes out, and it renders both the vaccine and past Omicron infections ineffective, I'll go back to wearing a mask in class (but probably won't when hanging out with my friends; symptoms are not that bad). I'll also still wear my mask if my professors indicate they would prefer if we did (or if they fully require it) because I don't want to make their jobs harder than they need to be.\n\nAt some point in time, we're going to have to return to normal. Omicron, unfortunately, is a major setback, as the vaccine is ineffective at preventing breakthrough cases. That means, until we have an Omicron booster, the only way to be protected against Omicron is by catching it, which is obviously undesirable.\n\nThe purpose of masks is to act as community protection in the absence of individual protections. Since most students are no longer individually protected due to Omicron, it makes sense to re-implement community protections for classes (I'm kind of surprised Kettering is removing them). With that said, if you've caught Omicron and are fully vaccinated, it is highly unlikely that you will catch COVID-19 for the next few months, so there isn't a reason to wear a mask (although a mask mandate should **not** allow such an exclusion; it's impossible to enforce).\n\nNote: Hanging out with friends is a different story. Everyone can agree whether they want to wear masks, taking into account that for vaccinated, healthy students, symptoms are, on average, about on par with a cold.",

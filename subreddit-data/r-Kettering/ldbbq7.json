    "postText": "Kettering Administration, Professors, and Students,\n\nIt is understandable that there is a strong desire to squash cheating and to promote academic honesty when taking exams. This past few terms where students have been learning online had opened a whole new world to cheating as it has become increasingly more difficult to proctor exams reasonably. The attempts to resolve the issue of proctoring online exams have been rather impressive and has already been proven to be effective. However, it is my opinion that these methods of proctoring online exams should not involve the use of invasive software that capture video and audio activity.\n\nHonorLock has been viewed as a great solution to the problem of cheating in online testing environments and has shown to be very effective at doing this. Having read through some of the client-side code, I can confidently say that it is very thorough in detecting potential cheating. So while HonorLock is a great solution to resolving the issue of cheating, what is the concern? Why are a number of students resistant to having their exams monitored to ensure fairness?\n\nThe issue at hand is not necessarily having their exams monitored, in fact many students support the efforts being made by professors to ensure a fair testing environment is put in place. As a student who has concerns about HonorLock, I can provide some insight on why I am not in support of the use of HonorLock. I find the software to be overly intrusive, and that concern isn't just for my own data security or potential legal ramifications.\n\nI chose to stay home this term due to the ongoing pandemic as myself and my family members are part of the at-risk portion of the population for extreme difficulties due to COVID-19. The working (three) family members have also opted to work from home. This has proven to be challenging due to all three of my family members handling sensitive data that cannot be legally disclosed. They each have their own work space within our home and no other family members may enter their respective spaces. These contract agreements have all been amended to include clauses on network security and family members as to protect the sensitive information. Should any of this data be leaked in anyway, a member of my family may face a very heavy lawsuit. However, it isn't just my family that should have concerns of facing a lawsuit, Kettering and its employees are also at risk.\n\nKettering's risk due to audio and video capture extends beyond the potential capture of non-disclosable information. And, in fact, I'll ask two questions that I wish to have addressed by any administrators or professors that may read this letter: what considerations were made when choosing to use HonorLock? Have you considered potential legal or societal ramifications due to the capture of audio and video?\n\nI know many students will be reading this letter as well, and many may wonder what types of legal or society ramifications may be had from this. One scenario that I have mentioned several times in my previous comments is the potential of recording a minor who has accidentally exposed themselves. This can be a student or a family member who is a minor. Another scenario is the eavesdropping statue of the state of Michigan:\n\n&gt;\"Section 750.539c; Any person who is present or who is not present during a private conversation and who \\[wilfully\\] uses any device to eavesdrop upon the conversation without the consent of all parties thereto, or who knowingly aids, employs or procures another person to do the same in violation of this section, is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in a state prison for not more than 2 years or by a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-750-539c](http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-750-539c)\n\nThere are other options to HonorLock that have also proven to be effective. I am aware of one professor who had called student names randomly to have them turn on their video camera and microphone at random times during the exam. Professors have also analyzed test answers much like how they have done so when proctoring exams in person and questioned students directly when evidence was found.\n\nTo summarize, I ask that professors have open conversations with their students about the use of HonorLock and to make considerations to avoid the use of the obtrusive software and to seek other means of ensuring a fair testing environment. I also urge professors to hold discussions with their fellow colleagues about HonorLock.\n\nKettering administration, I wish for these concerns to be addressed again in an email sent to all students, faculty, and staff of Kettering.\n\nStudents of r/Kettering, I encourage all of those who have concerns of HonorLock to open discussion on it with your professors who have chosen to use it.\n\nProfessors of r/Kettering, I encourage all of those who have chosen to use HonorLock to take time during a lecture to discuss why it was chosen and to address concerns of students. I also encourage you to have a plan of action should certain content be captured and if a lawsuit is pushed depending on the content captured.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank You,\n\nu/McMahan_is_a_DILF\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT - SURVEY\n\nHere is a [link](https://forms.gle/er4P9dfSYtccZsVd6) to a Google Form survey. You will be asked to sign into a Google account so only one response can be submitted, however your email will not be saved when you submit to ensure anonymity.\n\nHere is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlUWf4lxeHLFNPmPH9n1w4GMa3Q6Yg3f-gy1nch4j-Gj36ULUOyFlWpJG54IaIYLxxq6nQnGmMTGzz/pubhtml) to the survey responses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT - YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH HONORLOCK\n\nI have created [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kettering/comments/ldgeo2/what_was_your_honorlock_experience_like/) where you can comment with your experience with HonorLock.",

            "comment": "Honestly if you don't like it you have options you aren't considering. You can transfer schools to one that is handling online learning and testing better. You can hold off a year or two until the school is open for fully in person learning and you've been vaccinated. You can email and talk to professors whose classes you are taking beforehand, and ask them what their plans are and choose accordingly. Yes, they all have huge downsides, but if you care as much as you seem to then you need to determine what you value and make a decision.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you want. Kettering's staff is going to make their decision based on what company is giving them the best cost, offering the easiest implementation, and offering the most effective service. As a student, you are a captive audience and what you want or think isn't ever going to be worth a whole lot. It is how it is, and you cannot change it. Deal with it, wait it out, or leave but you will have to accept it. That's 90% of life by the way - you can't really change decisions once they've been made, you have to accept it and find a way to deal with it using one of the options I outlined. It's a shit deal but life is hard so get a helmet.\n\nPersonally I would look at transferring if I were you and that passionate about the subject. There are a ton of good schools out there, many of which are doing very  well with online courses and testing.",

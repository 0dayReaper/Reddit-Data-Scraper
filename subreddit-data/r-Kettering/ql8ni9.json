I've had her in the past and now have her again this term for 2 classes (kms) \n\nshe does not know how to teach and unless you're already an expert in the subject you ain't gonna do that well. I would just have to respectfully disagree with you, kind sir",

As someone with fresh eyes, conditioned by 3 years at this school to have low standards (I had Salacuse for calc 1, calc 3, and matrix- talk about just reading out of the book) she's definitely not the worst prof I've ever had.\n\nI do cut her some slack cause it can't be easy starting at an engineering school in the middle of a pandemic, teaching a relatively obscure subject, in an acquired language, with very little support from the established profs that are nearly all like 40 years her senior and literally retiring faster than the department can fill their seats. She's also been very approachable and patient with me when I need to work with her, which earns her some brownie points.\n\nThat being said; she can be a little bit clumsy with administrative tasks; her tests, homework, and lectures could be a little more cohesive/uniform; she could give fewer tests in general; and she could spend more time on the subject at hand and less time reviewing classes we've already taken. \n\nBut again, I don't know her background, I don't know what information she's working with from the University, and I sure as hell don't know if I could do any better within my first 2 years in her position at a school like Kettering. There's absolutely room to complain, and you should bring your constructive criticism to her/the university so she/they know what to work on next, but every Prof has to start somewhere.\n\nETR: snark",

I came in with successful AP Chem experience (but no credit, thanks kettering) and he was probably the best at explaining what students actually needed to know to be more successful in future chem classes (and thus what you needed for exams) even though he was fully aware many would not continue with chem after his class. Saw him in person while he was lecturing the other day and had to stop and go look at him again just bc it\u2019s been so long. Man was a g, giving fair and reasonable expectations for students.",

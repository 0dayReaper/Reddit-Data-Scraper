I know that the Co-op office says you have to quit your co-op before applying to a new one but that is not how the real world works.\n\nDoes anyone have experience dealing with the co-op office with this?\n\nShould I just apply to other jobs without telling them and then tell them once I get a new offer? What are their repercussions?",

I polished up my resume before applying to a bunch of tech companies online and learned how to do technical interviews. End result was an offer from Amazon that pays double what Ford did and will pay for relocation in Seattle. I only contacted the co-op office after accepting the offer. They were surprised I was leaving but just kinda had to accept it since I already accepted an offer.",

            "comment": "I'm a senior who just finished my last term last week. You are honestly better off doing as much of your job searching on your own and largely ignoring the coop office. I have worked at three different companies over 7 co op terms and the only help I got from coop office was an email that said a company was hiring and basic resume help for my first term. Definitely apply, do interviews, get a job you want, and just tell them when you're hired. One term I had already been at my new job for 4 or 5 weeks before I even told the coop office I was employed and they were just like \"ok, we will send you the evaluation survey at the end of the term.\" They can't be mad at you for finding a better job with better pay, they just want you to stay at whatever shitty company you started with because it makes them and kettering look better to companies. Kettering does not have your best interests in mind, so you should keep your best interests in mind or nobody else will. Do what is good for you.",

Interview on your own.  Once you get another offer, sign it, and then tell your former co-op that you won\u2019t be coming back.\n\nThe co-op advisor is kind of like HR - you think they\u2019re on your side but they\u2019re really there to help maintain and preserve the relationship with the co-op employer, not help you.  You\u2019ll get the short end of the stick any time you deal with them.\n\nGo out, get your own co-op.  Employers like ambition.",

            "comment": " didn\u2019t tell the co-op office that I was looking. They are, in my experience, no help whatsoever in getting decent paying jobs. If u do still want their help then you can set your employment status as employed but seeking. You have to get that cleared with your work tho which usually isn\u2019t a problem. Do not quit your current job until after you accepted another offer. If u have one then just grind it out until you accept another job. \n\nWhat I did is I set my status as employed but seeking after my first term at ford. I applied for other jobs and didnt quit until I had accepted an offer. It happened to pay over double but that\u2019s not realistic for most tbh.",

You have to row your own boat.\n\nI would find yourself another job, give notice at your co-op, and start at your new job.  Then you can inform the co-op office.  If the new job is at an established co-op employer, it should be no issue at all.  If it is not an established co-op employer, you may want to run it by the co-op office before you apply.  But don't let them tell you to quit your job without something else lined up.",

I didn't have any problems from them but that might be because I did it 90% on my own till they had to set up the co-op program with the new company I switched to.\n\nI would say yes, apply for jobs and go to them once switching cause if I remember their was a few pieces of paper that had to get sorted out. But that could have been for a new company.",

I walked in with all the need emails showing I had a new co-op and axed my old one and that I needed to set up the new company. Didn't give them much of a choice but I told them that I was look the term before. Is it the best way, no, but it worked for me.",

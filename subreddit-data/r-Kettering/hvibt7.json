    "postText": "Hey everyone! I hope your terms going well! Something I noticed at Kettering is there's a general \"don't ask don't tell\" attitude when it comes to experiences with xenophobia. I was wondering if you would take the time to let me know if you've ever experienced anything racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise at Kettering? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you could follow the link to the google forum. My hope is that we can start a conversation about an unspoken problem at our University. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkxP7V3TrU2AzLMpNcf5PannK7va5PUlTfeaTXNC\\_k-ysJbA/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkxP7V3TrU2AzLMpNcf5PannK7va5PUlTfeaTXNC_k-ysJbA/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

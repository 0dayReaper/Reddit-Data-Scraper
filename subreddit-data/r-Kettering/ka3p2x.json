Kettering will buy it and use it as they wish, handpicking which functions they'd like to utilize (within the constraints of Kettering's AUP and FERPA). That's why Zhang said most concerns don't reflect what they'll be using the software for (bullshit or not). \n\nThis is also why people were concerned with rumors that we would need to sign away our FERPA rights because for a school to use Honorlock to its full potential, that would be necessary. Fucked up right?\n\nRegardless we have rights protecting us.",

Look for recruiters on LinkedIn and connect with them (same with the people interviewing you). It never hurts to reach out to people at companies you are interested in, the worst that can happen is they say no thanks.",

If you want to work in Biomedical or other industries, or live away from SE MI, it may take a little longer to find something local. \n\nI was willing to travel, but I was not from SE MI, and did not want to particularly work in automotive. My first co-op was about 1000 miles away, and my current one is even farther. But tbh, it's an adventure, get to see the country and new places on the company's dime so I can't complain.",

As an alumnus, I scrape this sub for people I can hire or house.\n\nFrom my experience, though, don't be tied to any location in your co-op search. Imagine you get hired at a boring-ass company with no mobility and stick with it after graduation because of comfort/reduced risk. Your professional network now gets entrenched in that location and industry, so future opportunities end up looking like what you started with too. Look everywhere. Find something good.",

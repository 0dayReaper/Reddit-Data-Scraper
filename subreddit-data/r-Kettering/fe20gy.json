    "postText": "So- I mentioned a while back how I was deciding between Kettering and MSU.. and I decided Ketteirng\\~\n\nKettering seems like it will be a nice fit for me, especially going for Computer Engineering.. which I would think is difficult to get work experience in fresh off with a degree.\n\nIt said I'm going to be in A-section, which I believe will mean my incoming year will start sometime in July it looks like?  \nI'll be an incoming Freshman- with some transferable credits (Hopefully)\n\nI'm trying to get a head in scheduling: I have a plan for a trip I would like to take that would be from Thursday -&gt; Monday, at latest.. leaving early-mid Thursday. I don't think it can happen with how rigorous Kettering will be. Trip should take place from like July 30 -&gt; August 2nd.. So maybe? \n\nWith that being said.. When can I start registering for classes? I already have a plan in mind for what I am going to do, but it is just a brie one.. and how many should I take?  \nKnowing me, I'll probably accidentally hit an exam, since I am guessing you guys have around 4 per- or at least midterms.   \nI'm just super worried about the school only being 11 weeks.  \n\n\nTransferring classes (Hopefully)  \nCOMM 101  \nMATH 101  \nMATH 102  \nPHYS 114 + 115  \nChem 135 + 136  \nChem 237 + 238  \nEcon 201  \nHUMN 297 - Free elective  \nCS 297 - Free elective\n\n(Also MTA should give me more electives, but these are the core transfer-able ones it seems like)\n\nFrom the looks of it and what classes I'll be going into.. I think I'll be just as put as a sophmore, guessing if a Freshman takes Calc 1, Phys 1, then two electives and going on and so-forth or something like that.  \n\n\nI'll be going to the campus or what-not for the incoming Freshman event this Sunday, but I know I can't stay for the job fair on that Monday, and I also know that academic advisers don't work that day too.",

I\u2019d reach out to them.\n\nAs for going on your trip, I\u2019d advise against that due to Kettering\u2019s short terms and the variability of professors with absences.  But you know before school starts so tell them the first week, and you should be fine.",

Kettering staff will contact you with registration info. I\u2019m my experience, it was a phone call with an academic advisor. Also, don\u2019t miss class, with the pace of things here, it will REALLY come back to bite you. Also, there is no consistent exam time (outside of finals), you will have to read the syllabi you receive to figure that out. But honestly, if you work ahead, and work hard &amp; smart, you will do fine here.",

            "comment": "Just a note: taking three five days off for a trip, three of which are classes which you may have a lab during, is a very, very bad idea. Itd be awesome if you somehow got only classes Thursday morning and one or two non-lab classes on that Friday and Monday, but even then, you're more than likely going to have at least 2 medium-difficulty assignments due during that period of time. If you have any lab class (which is likely given your major), you'll either have a lab session (that is _never_ skippable) and/or a lab report due. \n\n\nQuickly glancing at the calendar, looks like that'll be third week Thursday to fourth week Monday. That's prime \"first test\" time, considering the class can then have a midterm test 3-4 weeks later.\n\n\nI believe you won't have to move in until July 9th or so (check your reference material, not mine). I strongly suggest taking your trip before then. You will unavoidably come into some strain. \n\n\nAlternatively, there is long weekend week 8*, where there is both Friday and Monday off. That will likely be the weekend of September 4th (labor day weekend). While I'd suggest using that time to participate in some club events, it's also a good time to take a vacation. Please keep in mind that teachers will often use the Thursday before for a test, since week 9 starts the final third of the term, so you should plan to be in class that day.",

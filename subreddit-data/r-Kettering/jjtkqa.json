    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nThere's a lot of weirdness going on, and the need to be connected with people is increasingly apparent... So, I am starting a Catholic group on campus! This a social group that is focused on exploring and experiencing God in the Good Life. This group is not limited to one group of people, but please note that there will be a focus on the Catholic perspective. We will have discussions, have activities (as much as we can), and even have speakers present material to us. Please DM me if your are interested! \n\nPeace,\n\nMD",

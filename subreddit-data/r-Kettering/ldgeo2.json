    "postText": "Sorry for making yet another thread on HonorLock (forgive me r/Kettering mods and members).\n\nIf you've been keeping track of the HonorLock posts you would've seen my [initial rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kettering/comments/lcz8yo/fuck_honorlock/), my [open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kettering/comments/ldbbq7/yet_another_open_letter_addressing_honorlock/), and possibly submitted a response to my [survey](https://forms.gle/er4P9dfSYtccZsVd6) on the subject (responses to this survey found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlUWf4lxeHLFNPmPH9n1w4GMa3Q6Yg3f-gy1nch4j-Gj36ULUOyFlWpJG54IaIYLxxq6nQnGmMTGzz/pubhtml)).\n\nI would like to see what students had experienced when taking an exam proctored with HonorLock.\n\nA quick selection of questions that I'm interested in, but you may respond with whatever you like:\n\n* Did you have technical difficulties in any way?\n* Did you face a false flag situation?\n* How did your professor handle the false flag?\n* Were you affected in any way emotionally or mentally?\n* Did you feel like you would have performed better without HonorLock?\n* If you got caught cheating, what evidence was presented to you?\n\nI intend on saving these posts for reference and will make the compilation accessible to everyone in a [Google Doc link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR4HaowQLQUObi8AWOwbF1wUVHUBStrYnSE0Qh09t2qDq1sOdIxYj1Y7xVgp3U2D1GmLvcNiVylUUj5/pub) that they may refer to professors whom you wish to discuss HonorLock with. No usernames will be recorded in the Google Doc.",

The open book - use whatever resource you want (not illegal ones ofc) and show me how you solved this problem sort of tests really help. They are extremely hard but they definitely help. If it\u2019s a long lasting project that takes a week to complete using all the resources (google, calculators, matlab, research papers and everything else) that would be terrific. \nI\u2019d probably love engineering so much more. Bonus points if the prof makes it a real life problem instead of saying - find pressure loss in this tube.",

If you would like to receive\u00a0an update when this happens, be sure to check 'yes' in the box that says \"I would like to be contacted directly when an order form is available\".\n\n[https://forms.gle/jXXBTA9a8QWVkJeS9](https://forms.gle/jXXBTA9a8QWVkJeS9)\n\nWe'll be looking for the most cost-effective options to print these (not customink, that was just the program we used to plop the images onto the shirts).\n\nThis survey is limited to Kettering emails just because this is a public forum. If you would like to fill this out and do not have access to a Kettering email, just DM me and I can get a different one to you :)\n\nIf you have any trouble with the survey at all, please DM me and I'll be happy to sort it out!\n\nHere are are the shirts in question:\n\n[Fronts say \\\\\"Rumors are for boomers\\\\\", top back says \\\\\"That's why we were given two middle fingers\\\\\", bottom back says \\\\\"and that's why we have two middle fingers\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/t8rc7cq0g0f51.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4a4933f45042e2996885bdddbc1058d164783fb6)\n\nThanks so much for your interest!",

It's like you found a list of the top internet memes and tried to use it in you shirt for an effect. \n\nAlso who are we flipping off? I assume the people who are spreading and making rumors but... from a distance its not easy to understand the shirt; I can see the middle finger better than the warped text.\n\nI get it, you hate rumors and you want us to start a movement against them. That being said, I'd rather confront rumors directly instead of \"using my two middle fingers\" and chanting \"rumors are for boomers\".",

I also don't have to make a shirt to counter what you are doing. I'm focused on the \"rumors\", not the t-shirts. IMO, even ironically, this shirt makes no sense. \n\nI just figured if you were making a shirt, calling them \"Anti Rumor\" shirts and going though all this trouble, it was somewhat serious. Have fun I guess.",

It really feels to me like you're grasping at straws to make this look as bad as possible.\n\nYou're entitled to your opinion, but it's really not that deep bro. We created some designs, our friends were interested in them, so we thought it would be fun to make them into shirts and open it up to everyone. Sure, say it's in poor taste, that's an honest critique, but you don't need to shit on our work like this.",

I\u2019m not trying to make this look as bad as possible, why would you accuse me of that and expect me to believe that \u201cit\u2019s not that deep\u201d. I just had a few things to say, that\u2019s it. I made one post, and replied to your comment. You act like I\u2019m taking thing too seriously, but you took the time to make a shirt with your friends. I don\u2019t know what to say. \n\nI\u2019m leaving this post be. who am I to rain on your parade. Clearly it\u2019s not that serious, so at this point I need to stop cuz further comment isn\u2019t needed. Heck I didn\u2019t even need to comment in the first place, but I did. I guess I take this topic more seriously than you.",

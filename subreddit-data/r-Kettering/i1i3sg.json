Based on this post and the last one from you on this sub, I think you just need to realize that nobody owes anything to you. Nobody owes you friendship or support if you're not offering it back. \n\nHumans gonna human. It's built into our code to work in our own self-interest. If you're not bringing anything to the table, if you come off the wrong way, nobody's really gonna spend the energy it takes to stick around, especially if they're not getting anything in return for it. If you're not fitting, nobody's going to bend their backs to make it happen. Maybe you think you're bringing something to the table, but really think about what that is. In every interaction, try put yourself in the other person's shoes and learn who you are from an outside perspective. Would you want to be around you? Would you want to pick up what you're putting down?\n\nWork on yourself, and you'll find your people. I say this as someone who has been working on myself as long as I can remember. Throughout grade school I just couldn't fit in for one reason or another; being a minority (in multiple aspects), getting picked on and reacting in a way that made me a target, being socially under-developed, being interested in engineering but not fitting into the typical \"engineer\" type, to name a few. People will see you for the things that set you apart, for better or for worse. It's human nature.\n\nNot all, if any, of those things are really my fault, but they're all things I'm responsible for correcting. I'm getting there, not as fast as I'd like to, but one step at a time. It sucks, not everyone has the \"magic touch\" it takes to fit in socially, but that's ok. There's plenty of resources out there, you just have to be willing to admit to yourself that perhaps it's time to start looking inside yourself rather than at everyone else around you.",

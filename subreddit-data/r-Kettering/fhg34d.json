    "postText": "I am requesting Kettering hold an emergency town hall meeting with Dr. McMahan. We need to know why we aren\u2019t online. Personally, I would like to ask you face to face why you are putting all students and faculty at a much greater risk. Also, why aren\u2019t you doing your part to stop the spread COVID-19 by being proactive and going straight to online like every other university rather than reacting to a potential case here on campus. Rather than limiting social gathering like the CDC advises, we just hosted a massive first robotics event, a job fair, and have had many new people visiting here. I would just like to ask why you are not taking this pandemic seriously and why you are putting us all at an increased risk of serious lung damage/scarring and or death.",

            "comment": "Yeah I really like where youre coming from here but do you maybe think we could do that, you know, ONLINE and not IN PERSON to prevent people from needing to be around one another and increase the spread of disease. If the university has really always had the health of students on and off campus as their first priority I think they'd be willing to elaborate why they've made the decision to put us at risk. It's not that no cases have been confirmed at Kettering, it's more that thousands of potential carriers that the university has no record of travel plans (particularly from dozens of international businesses hiring at Kettering) were just on campus over the past 2 weeks and you don't know if any cases have been carried from that event. Just because 2 people are waiting for the CDC to confirm that the state of Michigan was correct in diagnosing Covid19 doesn't mean that other cases aren't potentially undocumented particularly if people were fighting through symptoms to make it to high profile events that they've been working towards for a few months or years for both robotics and job fair. I understand that with Kettering so close to the end of its term it's difficult to move over to an online session this late in the game. but even for a couple more weeks being able to spread the virus to students and staff that you're taking the health and safety first of maybe it's worth the extra effort from profs to put their classes online and to let them stay safe over the coming weeks. I'm on work term right now but even my work is doing more to prevent corona than kettering university and losing money because of it. It doesn't cost you nearly as much comparitively to move classes to an online format as it does to shut down lines at the plants that many companies have. Sure there's no guarantee that covid will effect Kettering, and sure you trust in us to be smart and not panic. But when you're hosting more events bringing outside students and businesses to events like robotics and co-op fairs you're betting on a much larger pool than you seem to think. Instead of culturing from a single swab you've taken 80 robotics teams, 40 some employers as well as B section coming back from another 60 some employers and took a smaller swab from each to see what would grow more in a petri dish.\n\nI like my odds at surviving personally but if you're saying that Kettering first priority or number one priority is health and safety of students you're showing a very low level of care for your priorities. \n\nIf other students are interested in asking Kettering to move towards online courses to actually ensure the health and safety of students we should move towards asking first and if they arent willing to care for health and safety there is nothing wrong with requesting to withdrakwl for health and safety concerns. If students have not already look into a leave of absence for Covid19 it won't cost you anything unless you run into scholarship issues and you can take a term off from school. I would highly encourage students to consider filing these to protect the university, it might not help their funding situation but this looks a hell of a lot worse than the 20 page essay Kettering sent out in regards to the Flint water crisis a few years back.you can't tell us everything is fine and we won't be affected this time. Stop telling us things that we already know don't deflect our questions. If you are unable to convert things over to an online course with your existing resources many companies have been providing expanded video sharing rooms to accommodate students and teachers to meet one and not in person to mitigate the spread of the virus some of the programs are even already used at the school. Profs should at a very minimum be able to navigate a computer to teach their class nowadays and I'm confident most of them could. If nothing else please consider listening to the same warning as other larger schools have, you had the chance to innovate but you chose to delay and unless you're hiding a cure for corona somewhere you're going to have to imitate other schools as you have had to to stay relevant in the university space over the past several years.",

Please understand that we are very concerned about the health and safety of ourselves and we didn't see the same from you before but now that we have it can be appreciated. Thank you Kettering for taking care of your students.",

A-Section is approaching finals, they couldn't just up and say \"go online\" because so many classes are project based and faculty needed as much time as they could to get to prepare to move their classes completely online. Other institutions have different circumstances.",

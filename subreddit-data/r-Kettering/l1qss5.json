I personally would feel a lot more safe on campus / willing to go to my classes in person if Kettering was much more transparent with where active cases were as they developed. \n\nAs of right now I really have little faith in the university given how the cases in the dorms were only disclosed discreetly.",

I had an in-person class get canceled in the summer for an unknown reason, I later found out that the professor had potentially been exposed a few days before in one of his other classes...only reason I found out was they sent an email to the people in that class, and one of them told me.",

I also have no training in epidemiology, so if I had an opinion, it wouldn't matter anyways.\n\nBut be careful what you wish for.   In Summer, when a couple of Greek houses were under quarantine, and Kettering sent out an email saying \"a couple of Greek houses are under quarantine\", the reaction here was largely \"why is Kettering always blaming the Greek system?\".   So, this time around, they're not sending out email updates, and now the reaction seems to be \"why isn't Kettering telling us what's going on?\".\n\nI don't know what the right answer is.   From all available evidence, people who need to know they've been exposed are being told, and people who don't need to know aren't being told what they don't need to know.   So ... \\*shrug\\*",

They never really named specifics other than there were confirmed cases and whether the campus and any events were being shutdown. There are definitely less students on campus so the potential risk to you is lower but cases pop up just like anywhere else. The worst times are the first couple weeks after move-in and after any holiday breaks. You\u2019ll be better off living in an apartment or rent but be prepared for the school to close or restrict on-campus activities at least once.",

If/when you get a notice, it'll be along the lines of \"someone you were in close contact with for 15 minutes a week ago just told us they're positive\".    \n\nThe good news about the MI-COVID app is that it relies on proximity detection with Bluetooth, so you don't have to actually know the other person.   (E.g. if you were in a movie theater with someone who tests positive later).  \n\n\nThe bad news is that it relies on both you and them using the MI-COVID app, so it's only as effective as its adoption rate.   And I have no idea what its adoption rate is.",

            "comment": "I was also an out of state student when I enrolled in Kettering and had to pay for the school out of my own pocket. If you're a decent student, the scholarships you get upon applying for academic performance will bring down the sticker price quite a bit. If you're an exceptional student, they may end up comparable to a top tier public University.\n\nMy co-op earnings, working during school terms on campus, scholarships (you can keep applying for both Kettering scholarships and external scholarships through college - I would recommend it) and loans made it easier for me to pay for school than the other options I had for engineering. I think when all was said and done, I had about $24K in loans which isn't a crazy amount (unfortunately) from any school. If your family is in a financial situation where you can get Pell Grants (I was not in this boat) those are grants / loans you also can receive from the FAFSA that you do not need to repay.\n\nShort answer - apply (isn't it free?) and see what the financial aid package is. Take into account co-op earnings and see how it compares to the other schools you're considering.",

Another important thing to note is to constantly apply for scholarships. Even if you don\u2019t think you can get them. Ive seen scholarships been given to people who got it because they were one of the only people to even apply.",

Realistically, you\u2019ll land a decent co-op and good job after graduation which will all help to pay off your loans and expenses pretty quickly. But taking on the debt is all pointless if you dropout. It\u2019s hard there man. Don\u2019t take it for granted and really think if you\u2019re up to the task.",

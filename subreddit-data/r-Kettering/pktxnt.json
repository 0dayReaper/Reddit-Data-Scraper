(Extensively enough that it has its own acronym!)    Unfortunately, one of the reasons it's been studied extensively is that it's problematic, for all sorts of reasons.   Here's just a few.\n\n1. It's hard for students to evaluate the quality of the instruction they've received in a new subject because, after all, the student doesn't (or didn't) understand the subject being taught when the course began.   So how well can y'all be expected to evaluate how well the course was taught?   If the material seemed easy, was it because the material was easy (and thus anyone could've done it), or because the material was hard but the instructor did a fantastic job in teaching it?   You're not in a great position to know.   That's not your fault, of course.\n2. SET ratings tend to correlate with all sorts of things that have nothing to do with teaching quality.   Teachers of required courses get worse evaluations than teachers of electives.   Teachers of courses outside the major get worse evaluations than teachers of courses inside the major.  Teachers of courses that meet at 8am get worse evaluations than teachers of courses that meet at 1:20pm.\n3. To put it bluntly: SETs consistently reveal student prejudice.  White instructors get better evaluations than non-White instructors.  Male instructors get better evaluations than female instructors.   Students will absolutely deny that they're prejudiced, of course; they're usually unaware of their own biases.   (There's a famous study of an instructor who taught two sections simultaneously of an online asynchronous course under two different names --- one male, one female --- and the female version of himself received significantly worse scores than the male version of himself.)\n4. Instructors aren't blameless in this, either; there are plenty of ways for instructors to manipulate SETs in their favor.   Kettering only surveys students at the end of the term, for example, which means that students who were forced to drop the course earlier aren't invited to participate.  In the old days when we administered SETs on paper, instructors could choose which day to give out the forms, which means instructors could pick a day when their class was in a good mood --- or when the class troublemakers were absent.\n5. Figuring out how to time the release of the evaluations is a problem.  Kettering makes the reasonable decision to not allow instructors to see course evaluations until after grades are finalized, in order to protect against *quid pro quo* agreements (for good evaluations) or retaliation (for bad evaluations).   But that also means that I typically don't see my course evaluations until a couple of weeks into the next term, which means that it's often too late to make significant course changes for the term in progress.\n\nAnd that's not even talking about what to do with the comments in the evaluations.   I've had terms when half of the students praise me for some teaching technique I used and the other half condemn me for using that same technique.   I've had criticisms from students for something I did that showed that the student didn't understand why I did something.   I've had students complain that I lecture too much; I've had students complain that I don't lecture enough.\n\nAnd that's before we even talk about the fact that I'm human, and I don't like being criticized by anyone.   When I see that sort of criticism, I have to intentionally get past my own defensiveness and try to evaluate the criticism on an objective basis.   It's hard to do.   Some of my colleagues won't even try to get that far.\n\nSo SETs are problematic in all sorts of ways.   But alternative ways of evaluating teaching are incredibly time-intensive for administrators.  It's \"easier\" just to give out a student survey and leave it at that.\n\nSo, in short: we know SETs are flawed, but we don't know what to do about it.",

            "comment": "I'll second the instructors who have chimed in: I read mine and take them seriously. I often change courses in light of them. What makes a comment particularly useful is if it offers constructive comments (both criticisms and a discussion of worked well), rather than just expresses rage. There are always a small number of students who are just pissed to be taking classes period (not suggesting this is you-- doesn't seem to be true of you, in fact). Comments that stem from this sentiment don't carry much weight with me because no matter how I change the course, such students will still be angry about having to take it. Relatedly, it helps to know what aspects of a course cannot be changed by the instructor. There are, for instance, university- and department-level requirements that tie our hands to some degree.",

            "comment": "So, I'll kickstart this thread again, because I think it might be illustrative of how hard it is to read teaching evaluations and decide what to do about them.\n\nSince the \"official\" course evals aren't available to me for a few weeks, and I have to get ready NOW for Fall term, I gave an anonymous Blackboard survey to my students in CS-300 (The Computing Professional).   Since I can't grade finals yet (still waiting for a few to be submitted), I went ahead and looked at the results today.   I asked three open-ended questions: \n\n1. What was the best part of the course?\n2. If you could change anything in the course, what would you change?\n3. What advice would you offer to future students?\n\nSo, the most common theme that students commented on in the questions above is the readings I assign.    Three students said I assign too much reading.   Two students said that the best part of the course was the assigned readings.   So, does that mean I should change anything about the readings?  \n\n(My gut reaction says that if I've got comparable numbers complaining about and praising the readings, I'm probably in the Goldilocks \"just right\" zone.   But is that just me choosing the easiest path, since that means I don't have to make any changes?)\n\nAlso, the complaints are coming from 3 students out of 12 who took the survey, but 30 students registered for the course.   So what proportion of students are complaining about the reading?   Is it 25% (3/12) or 10% (3/30)?   I could argue it both ways.  \n\n(Of course I can argue it both ways; I'm a professor.)\n\nAll of this is to say that survey results --- even when you care about the survey results, like many of us do --- can be hard to interpret.",

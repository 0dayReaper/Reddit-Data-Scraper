If you speak with the general academic advisors they are really helpful into looking at your degree works plan and just setting something very simple like in order for you to understand. Degree works is definitely something to look for that each academic counselor has to do for you so just try and look at that and then see what you need. It depends on what degree that you're going for but differential equations is needed if you're going into any type of engineering course. If you're going into something like computer science I believe the highest they want is calculus too and what not\n\nAlso voice typing is super fun so everything's here that I'm probably going to say is going to come out super stupid but oh well",

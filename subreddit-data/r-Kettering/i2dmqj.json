But if we sit here in an echo chamber and only produce a groupthink environment of disdain, nothing will ever change. I'm a Senior II at the university and I'm constantly saddened by my school's collective attitude. \n\n I'll be the first member of my family to graduate college, my parents have scraped pennies my entire life to help me, I've never considered myself to be a smart person but I've worked my damn ass off since coming to Kettering and I'm proud of what it's taken to get here. All that I ask is that we understand that it takes a certain level of privilege to get to attend this university in the first place and maybe just maybe we should appreciate that in itself before going into autopilot complaint mode. I will always support a constructive discussion to make our school better, but simply complaining on Reddit and in-person only discredits our university and the work that we put into trying to achieve there.",

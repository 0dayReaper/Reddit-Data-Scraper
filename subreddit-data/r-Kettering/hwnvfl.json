                    "comment": "From what I saw McMahan did not have any real intention of using the town hall as a way to communicate with the student body. He had a list of his own pre-written questions he was going to answer and address that really weren't the concerns of those in the call. Students who were asking questions that were \"aggressive\" were also muted because he didn't have a concrete answer to them. He then let it slip that there were two positive cases of Novel Corona Virus on campus from faculty. This started a downward spiral in the conversation with students wanting to know how those cases were handled which McMahan didn't answer directly. We then got into the conversation on why are we paying full price tuition for the lack of services. It really was more frustrating than productive or reassuring as a student on campus. \n\nTL;DR: McMahan is the senate and Kettering likes taking your money",

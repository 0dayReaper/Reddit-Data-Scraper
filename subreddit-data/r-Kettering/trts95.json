            "comment": "I think that it'd be really hard to pass up the experience and career trajectory that working at Ford would offer your daughter. She'd be on a course to see the world from a perspective that few other positions would allow. I've never heard of Leidos but looking them up they appear to be a pure tech company (maybe consultants or contractors also? Government contractor perhaps?) which is going to be quite the opposite experience as Ford. Depends what she wants to do. Typical OEM vs Supplier tradeoff is being a technical manager versus technical owner or forest vs trees. I'm a generalist, forest type of person that loves product development for the general public (versus the government, in this case) so I really gravitate toward the Ford option. \n\nCongrats to her on getting two offers already!! What an amazing opportunity.",

She likes data science and has always thought of possibly working for the government, but I think wants exposure to different areas before making any decisions obviously, which is where Ford may help. Thanks again for your input :)",

            "comment": "As an ex-Ford co-op and current CS major, I'd have to go with Ford. The brandname alone is enough to boost/kickstart your career and increase resume value. I personally had a poor time at Ford (no leadership,  old technology, no growth, limited help), so I left after only two rotations; however, I believe the program's ability to rotate you around different teams is VERY valuable since CS degrees serve you best by giving technical breadth as to allow you to see what you actually like and later choose depth (Ford also pays decently for a non tech company in Michigan). Also, avoid my poor experience there by carefully selecting a team that isn't dogshit like my first one was, and demand a mentor (I never got one, which even surprised my co op manager).\n\nMy personal opinion: Take Ford -&gt; Leetcode -&gt; GTFO\nI did this myself and will now make $50+/hr at Amazon this summer (only in my second year btw). I think working at a big tech company will be the best thing ever for most CS careers (or at least starting out). Reasons: HIGH pay, STRONG brandname, and experience in modern technology.\n\nJust be warned, the co op office prefers you stay at one job the whole time you're at the school and to do at least 2 rotations. I got around it by getting my offer first outside of the program, then telling the office after accepting. Ford also lets you skip a co op term if you still want to stay but also try something new in summer if you want. \n\nNothing wrong with staying at Ford though, just consider your options.",

Leidos you would work on the same team you\u2019re entire tenure there. However, I know multiple people who worked there who never advanced in their responsibilities. It was the same menial intern jobs every term, no increase in responsibilities. Both have upsides, and both have downsides.",

            "comment": "Personally, I like to stay away from bigger companies (just my preference) but seeing some of these replies about Leidos makes me think that Ford would be a better option. Leidos seems like the type of company that just wants to hire labor cheaply to do menial work which is definitely not ideal for co-oping. You want a company that has a good plan on getting you to get some hands-on experience in what they do and that pushes you to understand the process as well (this is why I like smaller companies better, they tend to excel at that).",

I took the automotive route when I was choosing a co-op and now that I'm trying to get out of the automotive field, it's proving to be very difficult. Not saying it'll be impossible if she chooses Ford, but just another factor for her to consider.",

I would definitely ask questions about both of the Co-op programs specifically about what type of work they will have your daughter doing (Emphasizing software development experience or whatever CS adjacent work your daughter is interested in). Housing stipends and tuition reimbursement programs things to ask about as well.   \n\n\nI think the most important aspect of any Co-op is being able to walk out in 4 1/2 years with a marketable set of skills. So I would choose whichever you and your daughter think will offer her the most meaningful experience.",

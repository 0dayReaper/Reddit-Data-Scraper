            "comment": "There is no option on this to show support for honorlock, it might be clearer if 0% of student responses supported using spyware.\n\nAlso whatever other options being used should be disclosed to the student body before action is taken much in the same way that honorlock was brought up and not just immediately implemented. Too many privacy barriers have been so casually dropped since the start of this pandemic with some schools outright breaking hippa or video calling services blatantly lying about encryption and privacy, not to mention the often forceful contact tracing as helpful as it can be it's a total invasion of privacy. At this point I'm amazed that everyone isn't concerned about privacy more, if you had your debit/credit card number out in the open you would get it changed, the same you would if your phone number was posted on a billboard or any other personal information, it's the same with personal data stored on computers. If you've got a file with birth date, name, email, or any other personal information and any program you aren't willingly allowing to access your data does access them it's no different than having all your information sent in an envelope to whoever it may concern. Good news is not everyone at KU is incompetent some profs have been giving good tests for an online environment requiring you to know material since the first virtual school term and they were the best classes I had taken so there's some hope. Rather than limiting a solution maybe kettering should take its own advice and innovate the way that it reaches and allow resources and have profs unwilling to do work taken off tenure for not doing their job. Not all students are being academically dishonest and due to some students using resources already available at their fingertips doesn't mean that others who are stuck memorizing the same dumb formula should be punished by having the personal privacy completely bulldozed. If kettering is looking to take meaningful impact on academic dishonesty it needs to look to how it handled the issue before covid when if I had to look around and guess 40% of students had snuck a note card, written on their hands, or just skipped an extra page in their test. Students feel the need to cheat and I feel that says more about the school than the students. Paying a ton of money only to worry about failing classes is neither helpful nor healthy, it's time for kettering to \"innovate don't Imitate\" and actually care for it's students\n\nPS sorry to all the staff who are going to have to deal with shit for this when they don't have control over the problem so like some IT people and a few profs that will probably get flak when they weren't involved with honorlock at all.",

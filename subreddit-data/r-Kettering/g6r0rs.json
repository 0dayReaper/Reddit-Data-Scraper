Missing an email is excusable... but I'm not sure how you'd get through any class right now without internet. \n\nOn the other hand... the shutdown has been hard on everyone in different ways, and I feel like students and professors are finding solidarity in, \"We're all in a situation we've never prepared for, please be patient and try to work with me while I learn and figure it out.\" \n\nObviously I don't know if this professor tried to work with this student or not... but considering they sent a professor's equivalent to a callout post for drama,  I'm gonna guess not.

            "comment": "Tldr because I ranted; You don't NEED internet to get through university... minus the virus situation, it'd be easy to get through Kettering without it. Also being an engineer doesn't on whether you have internet, it's about how you can create solutions to problems, even when you have nothing to work with. I agree this specific student is shit outta luck... but I think it was handled poorly and there's a lot of bad standpoints from both the prof and some commentors that kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  \n\n-------- \n\n\nOkay, one more thing I want to give my input on; \n\nThis email, as well as some of the comments on here so far, are giving the impression that it's impossible to be successful without something as simple as internet access.  \n\nI get it, we're in the digital age, literally every aspect of our lives involves internet in some way. However,  it's not impossible to get a STEM degree without direct access... I'd argue that it's actually not that hard at all actually. \n\nFirst; Students can realistically get through Kettering without a lot of these \"essential\" resources. From personal experience, I've known a lot of people who had no access to internet at home, but it was never an issue because they had resources to help them. Computers at school or the public for example, I've seen used exclusively as a source for many without intermet.\n\n If you take away the Coronavirus situation... it's very possible and easily plausible that this student could have used Kettering as their resource. Kettering offers so many resources that most students could reasonably get through school without needing internet, a laptop, software,  e.t.c. \n\nSecond; The idea that not having internet access should discourage you from being an engineer is ridiculous. You don't /need/ to have these resources in college... you're getting an education so you'll be able to earn the money for them later! And again, most jobs will have resources like internet, a work laptop/phone, etc., and by the time you're working full time, it'll be easy to afford those resources yourself. \n\nTake it from me, someone who will be close to 130k in debt by the time I graduate; I don't always have the resources either... but Kettering gives me every resource I need until I can get me the job to afford it. I don't regret a single cent of it either, because engineering is what I love, and I'm not quitting my education in exchange for money. Seeing the implication that you can't be successful without internet... it's genuinely a laughable comment to an inner city kid. \n\nLast; Being an engineer isn't about being wealthy enough to have every resource right off the bat, it's for innovating new solutions in any way possible! People are mistaking this with the idea that this student isn't able to engineer a solution to their problem with internet... So what? Engineers fuck up ALL the time, not every plan works. I'll bet everything thought that this student is still working on finding a solution, despite already being removed from the class.  \n\nEngineering is about working together to find some solution that works, even if it isn't always ideal or a long term solution... do what you can to make it work for now if you're unable to perfect it.  Many of the faculty members at Kettering are THE most accomodating I've ever seen.\n\n I had a classmate in my CS class who didn't own a laptop, and every day our professor brought one to class for him to use. I've seen professors give students access to  rooms/shops after hours because they didn't have the resources at home available to them. I've seen professors who change their entire teaching method to best fit their classroom, and work one on one with whoever needed some extra time or a different way to learn the topics. These are just the first few that come to mind,  but I could list these forever. \n\nThese are faculty members that take their job as more than just teaching a subject... it's doing what they can ti ensure a students success, and more often than not their success it's hindered by something outside of the classroom. \n\nSo while I agree in this /specific/ situation it's shit outta luck for the student, I did find it kind of ironic that for how much he pushed for the idea of this being the age of technology, there was absolutely no solution, only email. \n\nDo I know this student and professor, what the situation is for the student, or if there's some deeper story behind this email? No, and I won't pretend like I do. What I do know though, is that you don't have to be in a good financial place to get through Kettering because of all the resources it offers and it's faculty. To say so is both demeaning and laughable at the same time.",

This means that the student has some form of internet connection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point I'm trying to make with this post is that professors at Kettering are not doing everything the can for online learning. They have to adapt their lectures to account for the change in our learning environment. \n\nDr. Berry suggested the student use the hot spot from their phone, and this is a great idea. The problem now becomes bandwidth. Most wifi can not support streaming 20+ audio and video messages at once. What professors should be doing is record their lectures and post them so that students with lousy internet can still learn the material. Dr. Berry had no reason to attack this student the way he did and has done nothing to try and change his teaching style for his new class structure.",

I take issue with the fact that he is shaming the student for not having access to good internet, as if it was the students choice. The student likely went back home with his parents for this term and the parents may not have ever had a need for internet, or he lives in an area where there is no infrastructure in order for them to have internet. Whatever the reason is, the fact remains that the student has little control over their current situation and should not be insulted or looked down upon for it.\n\nIf you ever had Rao, \u201cAll people are products of their unelected circumstances.\u201d\n\nNot only that but the attitude the prof takes is disgusting. Instead of sympathizing with the student and trying to understand in order to better the situation, he chose to ridicule them.\n\nLast thing I want to add is that it seems the student relied upon the internet that Kettering University was providing to them. So, it is not as if the student had never had or saw the value of having access to the internet, which is what the prof was implying with this email. To me it looks like the prof here is not understanding what the actually issue here is, which is that the student is paying exorbitant amounts of tuition to a school for access to resources that they are no longer providing for them.",

Second, the professor likely has a whole class of students he is creating content for. It makes sense that he has to do that, but a bunch of special shit for just one student? Yeah, I don't see that happening. There would be no chance in hell of the student keeping up with the rest of the class and finishing on time with them.",

Like it\u2019s a rough reality but I took a class that required I bring a laptop everyday. If I forgot it that\u2019s on me. I didn\u2019t set myself up for success. If you don\u2019t have the tools necessary (internet being the case in this email given the recent circumstances) then you won\u2019t be successful. I don\u2019t think its fair that some students getting screwed but if you can\u2019t attend class or submit assignments is the professor just supposed to make an exception and hand you an A? He\u2019s being blunt but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s being aggressive or rude in any way",

What if they are at Kettering on a full ride and their parents can\u2019t afford internet? What if they live in a place where they can\u2019t get internet speed that can support webcam lectures? There are a lot of circumstances outside of a students control that could mean they don\u2019t have reliable internet access.",

    "postText": "In the Summer of 1896, Charles F. Kettering was lost in the woods of the Upper Peninsula. One late night, on the verge of collapse from hunger, mist began to roll from the trees. As he looked up, he saw the rack of the mightiest moose he had ever seen. The moose looked down at Chuck with those dark chocolate eyes, conveying a meaning he hadn't seen since Olivia. He felt hot moose breath on him as he began to remove his belt. The huffing of the great beast increased in frequency, as he sensed its urgency. The sculpted arms of Charles F. Kettering removed his pants and undergarments in one swift, engineered motion. His pulsing, erect cock leapt up, pointing towards the panting monstrosity. A little bit of slobber dribbled down from the moose, as it lowered its great head towards Chuck's quivering member. As the its moist lips rounded on Chuck's well educated mushroom cap, he began to convulse in anticipation. The tongue of the moose wrapped around his shaft to grip him in a way Olivia never could. As the moose surged down Chuck felt its rough, furry chin contact his inner thigh. The moose pumped and pumped and Chuck was overcome with another sensation in addition to his sexual ecstasy; his legs began to itch from the moose fur rubbing on each stroke. He fought the urge to scratch at his legs, fearing the moose might stop if he intervened. For this kind of pleasure, he would do as any great inventor would and endure. Just when he thought the pleasure could not possibly increase, the moose began to grunt. The added pleasure of the grunting brought him beyond where he could hold back, and Chuck began to spasm in the most powerful full body orgasm he had ever experienced. Gallons of Chuck's milky white genius sperm coursed through the moose's throat. As the generous moose choked on Chuck's seed, Chuck pulled out his Winchester 94 hunting rifle and aimed it at the beast's heart. CRACK! Some say if you approach Old BJ alone late at night, you can still feel the hot breath of unrequited moose love.",

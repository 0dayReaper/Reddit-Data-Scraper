Is this correct? I live with people who are immunocompromised and it would save me a lot of stress if this was the case.",

I don't have it in writing though, so I'll reach out again through email. I was just concerned regarding labs, since all the lecture courses being live streamed makes sense, but I dont get how they expect lab groups to function and stuff. I live far from campus so if I don't have to go, I dont want to. But at the same time I dont want to burden a single team member to go and collect data either...",

    "postText": "I am aware that now is not the ideal time to be thinking about this, but are there any speed cubers here that would be interested in helping me form a club? I\u2019m a C-section student who won\u2019t be returning until the fall, and then will alternate back to A-section in the winter. So if I were to form a B- section club, I would definitely need someone to take over afterwards (or just wait until winter and form an A-section club). It has been a while since I\u2019ve cubed but still know the basics and can still solve. I pretty much just know beginner\u2019s method with 3x3s and 2x2s, but can solve in under a minute. Additional suggestions from someone more devoted would be greatly appreciated. I would also like this club to teach beginners how to get into cubing (and possibly give them speed cubes). If this is something you would like to move forward with, DM me regardless of section and we can discuss details.",

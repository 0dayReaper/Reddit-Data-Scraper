    "postText": "Has anyone had MECH-416 with Professor Basem Alzahabi? The class is Intro to FEA with Structural Applications. I'm somewhat concerned about how well this class will go given it's already March and there are still 20 seats open in his class. Do people avoid him for a reason, or am I just being paranoid about it? Thanks for any input.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I am B-section, and this class is scheduled to start next month, hence my concern about the 20 spots still open.",

            "comment": "Im registered for this class also. Id imagine seats are open since its just a very specific elective, it probably doesn't satisfy certain minor requirements (where I think many people use elective spots to get one), and since it's an 8am. I know looking him up on Ratemyproffesor, he didn't look like a bad rated professor.",

Not sure how much experience you have with FEA, but I'm going to assume it's all in NX from MECH 300. If this prof does the course similarly to Echempati, you might not like half of it. We had to do all this strange theoretical stuff with MATLAB coding to get values for problems and then do more practical FEA with a CAD software of our choosing. If you are good with MATLAB though you will probably have a better time than I did. Luckily Echempati graded stuff fairly easy in the end and I ended up with a B.",

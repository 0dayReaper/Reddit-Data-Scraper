We brought maintenance in to repair the broken shit, the exact response to all of it was \"I don't want to fix that.\" Draw your own conclusions from that.",

It is nice being able to have your own bathroom and kitchen. You can choose to live in a 2 person or a 5 person apartment. I also enjoy it because it is so close to campus. And the gated community is a nice safe feature. If you send me a direct message I can also answer other questions.",

            "comment": "I lived there when they were relatively new ('01-'03) and they were nice for what they were.  Close to campus (basically on campus), can drink in the apartment (can't do that in the dorm), your own kitchen and bathroom, and a private room. Picking your roommates is nice and so is being able to actually cook and not being required to eat on campus saves a lot of money.\n\nI can't comment on how they are NOW.  Maintence wasn't needed really for us because it was still new.  There was construction on the floor below us one summer term and it was HELL because they started it at 7 am and went til something like 7 pm.  I couldn't do any work in my room and had to spend the entire semester working in the computer labs.\n\nOther than the price and the manager trying to screw us on a TV (we weren't due to get it til 8th week because \"there was nothing to sit it on\"; I went down and told the manager that I wanted the price for the TV to be prorated since we would only have it for less than half the term.... we had a TV within one day), it was a decent place to live.  If you have decent neighbors, it's not bad.  Also, no fire drills when you're trying to sleep at midnight, so that's a huge plus.\n\nIf you want to save cash, look for a safe house (confirm there are no cameras in the bathrooms and bedrooms; solid rumors about several had that, especially when there were girls living in the house) or join a GLO.  \n\nActually, if you're full time virtual, I'd just stay at your parents' or your apartment you live in for work if you can.  Save your money this term and drive in if you need to.",

Ahem.\n\nA couple of my friends did find cameras placed by shady landlords in the house.  Those houses might be under new management and I don't recall which ones.  Just do a thorough check.",

Especially with Covid and everything you most likely won't have to be on campus so if you have no reason you NEED to be on campus there really is no point in putting out the 1.2k to 1.5k for the apartments. Overall its not bad, its a lot more manageable if you convinced 4 other people to move into a 5 man apartment with you. The 2 man's are really worth it in my opinion.",

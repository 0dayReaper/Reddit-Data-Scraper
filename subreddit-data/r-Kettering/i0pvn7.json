    "postText": "how in the world does shoving 20 people from different Greek associations into the Abbey to get tested help at all? giving all of Greek life one day to be forcefully tested is absolutely retarded. I've been doing all my classes online and completely minimizing all contact with people who aren't in my fraternity, so why am I being forced to be crammed into a common testing site. if someone shows up positive from this mass testing event contact tracing is going to take down every chapter. this is bullshit beyond belief, Kettering is run by absolute shit for brains",

The administration is vehemently anti-greek and want every opportunity they can get to dust off the soap box and preach to new students about bad going greek is.",

The admins of this school would score lower on an IQ test than the average shit-flingling monkey.\n\nOn another note: \"we'll double down on Salacuse being allowed to force students to be on campus in a classroom. Because reasons.\" From the math department doesn't help anything either.\n\nThey're gonna end up getting someone infected and I hope they get their asses sued into bankruptcy. Fuck Kettering and anyone who works for Kettering. A bunch of brainless idiots run and teach at this school.",

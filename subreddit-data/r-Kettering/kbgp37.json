    "postText": "I was expecting a lot of things, but this wasn't one of them. Sure, having people be tested before they come up to live on campus is a great advisory step, but this is endangering so many people. \n\nLet's be honest. Kettering has some old professors. When classes were hybrid, there would maybe be 2-5 people actually in the classrooms making it safe for the profs. Encouraging people to go to in person classes indoors makes it much riskier for both the professors and the students.\n\nIn addition to this, nearly every single Greek house on campus this B section term had an outbreak and had to go into quarantine. We even had a few scares last A section term. The pandemic is by far at its worst point right now. I really can't see their logic behind \"encouraging\" &gt;1000 students to move onto a campus that has already had several outbreaks.\n\nMcMahan says he wants a \"living campus\" with extra curricular activities available, but one of the huge reasons clubs were able to run last term is the fact that they could be held outdoors. Few (if any) people are going to want to go to clubs held outdoors in the winter, and many clubs are larger than 10 people, which prevents them from being able to meet indoors.\n\nIn my eyes, Kettering is really just shooting itself in the foot with this plan. We're gonna be in person until there are outbreaks on campus, and then back to online we go. It doesn't make any sense.",

Encouraging a lot of people to be in one place these days is a bad idea, but I\u2019m sure they are happy to overlook that fact so they can manage the high overhead of multiple high salaries, maintenance of aging buildings, etc, etc.  \n\nI don\u2019t have regrets about attending Kettering, but I always felt like I was just a revenue stream for them and my success didn\u2019t matter so long as I didn\u2019t flunk out and kept writing checks.  I haven\u2019t been a student at any other colleges so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re all that way.  Likely so.",

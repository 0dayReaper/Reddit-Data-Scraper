It was ***uninhabitable***.   I'm not talking \"uncomfortable\".   I'm talking \"relocating offices and classes out of the wing because of heat stroke\".   They worked as hard and fast as they could to fix it, but it was absolutely ridiculous for a couple of weeks.\n\nPutting reliable HVAC in an ancient building like the AB that was never really designed for it is horribly difficult.   That's why TPTB want to build a whole bunch of new buildings so they can tear the AB down.   Of course, I'll never see any of those buildings before I retire.  \\*sob\\*",

That's a whole other thing and just my luck (as soon as I graduated high school they redid the ENTIRE building and made it so great) and seems like after we leave, that's what kettering will be like \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnd I understand your point, but I'm just really annoyed because I can feel myself getting sick, and it's not covid but if I get a fever, I'm done for and it's midterms next week",

I know staff who pivoted back to work-from-home because they're freezing sitting at their desks.   \n\nAll I'm saying is that the suggestion that they're deliberately freezing/baking everyone to save money isn't true.   Yes, they do cut it back a bit to save money (and the environment) ... and believe me, teaching Monday 8am in Winter when the furnaces have been turned down over the weekend is No Fun.   But they're not trying to make people sick/uncomfortable.\n\nAt least not more than we already do (as I sit here grading midterms...)",

            "comment": "Email to campus today about the crater next to Mott:\n\nTo: Kettering Campus Community\n\nAfternoon Update on Campus Heating/Hot Water Issue\n\nWork is continuing to repair the underground steam line failure as quickly as possible.  This line provides heat and hot water to Thompson Hall, Campus Center and Academic Building.  Below is the current status of heat and hot water to campus buildings:Thompson Hall:  A temporary bypass line is in place providing heat and hot water to the building.  To help facilitate the repairs to the system, this temporary service line had to be shut down for a brief period beginning late on Monday evening, October 25th and was restored early evening the next day.  The maintenance team is monitoring the temperature level in the building and checking to confirm hot water availability on an ongoing basis.  Please note that if any unforeseen interruptions in hot water service to Thompson Hall should arise, students are welcome to use the shower facilities in the Recreation Center.If there are specific rooms or areas that are cooler or any problems with hot water availability, residents should immediately notify their Resident Advisor, so that this is promptly reported and we can respond to any such issues.  Also, as Residence Life Director Armani Thomas indicated in an earlier email to all residents, students may request a temporary room in another area of the residence hall.  To do so, residents should contact Armani directly.Campus Center:  There is only minimal heat and no hot water available in the building, except for the kitchen in support of the food service operation.  The building continues to hold heat in a range of about 66 to 70 degrees in most areas.Academic Building:  There is currently no heat or hot water available in the building; however, the building continues to hold heat in a range of about 64 to 67 degrees in most areas.Recreation Center:  The building is not part of the central plant steam system and as such, the building continues to operate as normal with regular heat and hot water.  Earlier this week, a separate issue with a circulation pump that provides heat to office areas in the building caused temporary heating issues, but this has been resolved.  Please note that if any unforeseen interruptions in hot water service to Thompson Hall should arise, students are welcome to use the shower facilities in the Recreation Center.Mott Center:  The building is not effected by the steam line failure and continues to operate as normal with regular heat and hot water.  In the coming days, there may be periods when such service will be interrupted to facilitate the steam line repairs that have connections to the central boilers located in the building.Timeline for Completion of Repairs:  At present, we expect the repairs to be completed by Tuesday, November 2nd and will continue to provide morning and afternoon updates on the status of the work.",

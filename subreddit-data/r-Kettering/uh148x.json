    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nMy son just was accepted into Kettering. I didn't see anything about tuition/room/board/other costs and anything about financial aid on the Student Portal. I emailed them and they said the financial stuff would be included in the packet mailed.\n\nWell I just got the packet and it has a welcome letter and an announcement of a merit scholarship (and the total amount of the scholarship), but nothing else about financial aid, or the cost of tuition, or the cost of R&amp;B, or anything.  Am I to just find this information on the website and subtract the merit scholarship from it?  \n\nAll the other schools he got into had a detailed financial aid letter with everything spelled out.",

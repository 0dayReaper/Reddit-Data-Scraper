But I can set up a discord for questions and stuff, typically do. But anyone who's come to me has said they only learn from me, so like I'm ready to do the best I can. \ud83d\ude05",

But the invitation is just too tempting, so I'll emerge from hiding for just a brief moment.\n\nI have many concerns about Honorlock, just as you do.  At the same time, I'm sick of dealing with students blatantly cheating on assignments.    (I'm not talking about borderline crap here, BTW.)\n\nI don't like using Honorlock.   I don't like not using Honorlock.\n\nSo, my challenge to you: let's come up with a third option.  Let's find a better alternative and have students and faculty work together to implement it. \n\nAnd, to answer the inevitable questions:\n\n* No, I don't know what this looks like.\n* No, I'm not restricting attention to a technical solution.  I think a cultural solution might be even better than a technical solution.\n* If some of you think this sounds like John Rawls, thank you for paying attention in CS-300 :)",

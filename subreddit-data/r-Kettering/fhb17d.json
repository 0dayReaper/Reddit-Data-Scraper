    "postText": "This is a Novel Corona Virus, the word \"Novel\" meaning that it is a new virus and the word \"Corona\" denoting the crown shape of the virus. This virus is a form of SARS or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and I can absolutely guarantee that your immune system has never seen a virus like it. 1 in 5 people infected require hospitalization and 1 in 10 people require a ventilator because they are unable to breathe on their own. \n\nThis is not just bad for the older populations, this is bad for us as well. This virus can leave permanent scarring in the lungs, people with asthma, obesity or diabetes are at a significantly increased risk for complications. This Virus will leave a mark on our culture for decades to come and it is just getting started. Please for the love of god don't think this is just a flu. \n\nFor example: the Spanish Flu had a death rate of around 2% in 1918 (during a time where there was generally no treatment for such diseases) and managed to kill AT LEAST 17 million people worldwide. The mortality rate of this virus is almost identical to that of Spanish Flu but manages to be as such within a modern medical environment. This virus also has an infectivity rate veritably higher than that of the Spanish Flu. This in tandem with the official declaration of a Pandemic by the World Health Organization should have you worried. \n\nMcMahan's plan here seems to be wait until there is a fire to put out before taking action. This reflects a terribly distorted world view and ignorance of the subject at hand. Any contact within 6ft of a contagious individual almost guarantees infection. Not leveraging Kettering University's online infrastructure is a mistake and a dangerous one. This is not about getting a day off similar to the likes of a snow day, this is about protecting our families and people we care about.\n\nSpanish Flu Stats:\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545404/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19545404/)\n\nWHO Corona Virus Updates:\n\n[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)\n\nCDC Corona Virus Landing Page:\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)\n\nLive Map (Johns Hopkins):\n\n[https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)",

            "comment": "The lack of proper action by Robert McMahan is despicable. I can't respect a man who can't respect his faculty, staff, and students enough to reduce the chances of spreading a potentially fatal infection. While I understand there is not much time left of the term, 16 days is a long period of time for the virus to spread. Waiting until there is a confirmed case in Genesee County is extremely risky. Infected people are able to spread the virus while having no symptoms, which means that they will not be tested until they are in the later stages of the infection where it transitions from a flu-like infection to a lower respiratory infection where there are severe complications. On top of this, many individuals avoid going to an urgent care because of the expense and usually being told that they're mildly sick. I've personally avoided going to an urgent care when I had an upper respiratory infection because I just didn't feel like going out of my way to go.\n\nKeep up the bleaching for now, hopefully an administrator can convince McMahan to get his head out of his ass and actually do something. Best of luck to everyone.",

But a good percentage of the student body drives. Go to class, you have the tunnel.\n\nPutting the lives of all who go on campus at risk for a potentially fatal infection is something I can't respect by any means. I remember going to elementary school with a major flu outbreak and I was 1 of 3 students in my classroom where the administration had decided to continue with classes. A teacher had died from complications related to influenza afterwards.\n\nI've heard \"but that's not how the real world works\" get thrown around by some people, but unfortunately there are many businesses closing for an indeterminate period of time because of the risk. I'm familiar with what it takes to keep a building disinfected during flu season, it isn't easy by any means. If there's anything I've learned while working as a custodian for a year, you will never be able to properly clean everything unless you have a lot of man-hours and have closed the businesses to the general public. I've cleaned up every kind of bodily fluid and it's actually sometimes terrifying because you don't know if you've actually fully disinfected an area, you only have guidelines to follow and who knows how effective they actually are in the long run.\n\nClarification: the last paragraph where I stated that not knowing if everything is disinfected is terrifying isn't a statement of being a germaphobe. I have no problem getting into dirty environments and potentially getting mildly sick. The reason why it's terrifying is because of the amount of severe blood-borne pathogens that exist and I cleaned up blood almost daily. I've had some of the worst experiences with the flu while not being admitted to a hospital. It's not a good experience having to be the one to clean a toilet that you puked in while you're at work on top of struggling to stand, nevermind walk.",

    "postText": "Hi there! I am currently a junior in highschool, and ever since a representative from Kettering came to my school, I have always wanted to go there. I have 2 fears though, tuition, and math. I know Kettering is a hard academic school, and I am not afraid to grind out the work, but I am not the best at math(B\u2019s),how much will this hurt me?  Also tuition, I know tuition is a lot of money, would I be able to pay it back with money from my CO-OP?",

Even if you put every dime towards tuition from your coop unless you have lots of scholarships, you won't be able to. But the experience earned and the speed of getting a job after graduation will easily pay off the loans within the first 5 years if you work hard.",

                    "comment": "It really depends on your scholarships and living situation. I was personally able to do it, but I was splitting a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 guys during work term. I also had a government co-op that paid $20+/hour with OT back in 2010. I worked quite a few 50-60 hour weeks, but that was mostly to get me some extra fun money. \n\nAgain, I know tuition has gone up, and not all the scholarships have scaled with it, but doing Kettering debt-free without parental help is still possible depending on your co-op situation. Most can do it with minimal debt like you said.\n\nThat said, I'm of the opinion that while Kettering does a great job putting you ahead in your career, it is not worth it without a significant aid package. If you're not getting close to 40% of tuition covered by scholarships, you need to reconsider if Kettering is really better than going to a state school or community college. $43K a year is no joke, and even if you don't end up transferring out, that level of debt is oppressive.",

I am also contributing a bit from my savings though and plan on taking out some student loans down the road, however with my job im not anticipating much struggle of paying those once i graduate.\n\nI'd recommend it, hard school, but having a real engineering job is dope. I am a member of a fraternity so that helps with the fun part. Just still important to have fun so yer not depressed all the time.",

                            "comment": "You're required to for graduation. I believe it's a minimum of 4 terms, with 3 being after junior year. The more co-op terms you can get, the better, from a money perspective and work experience. \n\nIn regards to paying for school, I have no financial support from my parents besides the fact they pay the insurance on my car and the small payment, but schooling, housing, food etc. is on my own. The best thing to do for a co-op is find one near your home, and commute to save money on rent. Some co-ops offer a housing stipend, and it may vary if you qualify depending on how far you live, others dont care.\n\nOnce you move out of the dorms, it gets quite a bit cheaper. Just try to maximize on scholarships. I think at this point between Kettering scholarships, and outside scholarships, I have about $34k in scholarships/ grants a year, which isn't that crazy to do considering Kettering makes up like $20k alone. Co-op should make up the difference, and if not, itll be a little bit in student loans. Many houses around the AB are like $300/month, they're just a little sketchy. \n\nPay varies, I had offers around like $18/hr, I ended up taking a $14/hr co-OP just because I liked what they did. Somebody I work with was suppose to be making $24/hr plus housing stipend of $2300 as a senior before corona shut everything down. Pays for co-ops varies greatly, but in general it's pretty good.",

I don't know about mechanical engineering requirements however.\n\nI took about 6 math courses and they only challenging ones for me were prob stats and calc 4 (diffeq). Most of the math professors I had were great with the exception of one (Cheng). Kettering is a small school so there are only around 5 math professors, so it can be difficult to avoid bad professors.",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about  math, there are really good profs at every level so if you can register early enough and do your research you should be fine, Kettering also provides tutoring and X level classes that meet 5 times a week instead of 4. These resources should get you through calc 1-4. Tuition can almost never be covered by your co-op earnings, and there\u2019s a decent chance a state school would be cheaper. That being said Kettering has a great reputation and co-op program. This makes up for the higher tuition if my opinion. That being said you shouldn\u2019t be paying close to $43,000 in tuition, merit scholarships in particular are an awesome resource, average grades can get you $14,500 a year and you can get up to $17,500, you do need an SAT/ACT score though, I\u2019m not sure how they\u2019re handling it right now with the Coronavirus but you can try and email financial aid, [this](https://www.kettering.edu/undergraduate-admissions/affordability) link goes into more depth and has a cost of attendance calculator. Just make sure that you are decided on your major or that Kettering has your backup, this is not a college where you can explore your options. Kettering is very specialized and I love it for that, however this does result in a decent amount of students dropping out. Kettering can get pretty intense, just stay positive and work hard and you should be fine.",

There\u2019s tons out there that are easy to apply for, you just have to put in the effort to look. \n\nI\u2019ve been able to pay for tuition, room/board and then off campus housing, and have a little bit of fun with my co-op earnings plus an on-campus job at the library. Scholarships really do cover a lot, I\u2019d recommend that you don\u2019t just apply to those through Kettering because there\u2019s loads more out there. \n\nAlso - don\u2019t be afraid of math. Some of the professors are bad, but a benefit of a small campus is that we\u2019re all in this together. Befriend someone who has already made it through the course with a decent grade and they should be able to help you out. There\u2019s also SI instructors for a lot of the math courses who are literally paid students there to help you if you need it.",

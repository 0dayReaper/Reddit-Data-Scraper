He was noticeably drunk in class, you can't understand his speech or read his writing, and he is generally poorly organized and doesn't seem like he has himself together. I put Kaiser instead because Dimitrovs classes are incredibly easy to pass, while Kaiser was so bad I just dropped him.",

Sure, she does the typical LS professor thing and you must agree with her and she expects you to work harder than you should for an LS class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, it's pretty clear she cares about her students. In my experience, if you ask her to review an essay for you, she will respond within the same day. She also makes an effort to memorize student names and such (pretty rare for a professor in my experience). This may be because I bit the bullet and just fed her her opinion, but I certainly felt that my essays and such were graded fairly and that she had made an effort to give me the grade I deserved (for better or worse).",

My main gripe with her, however, is just that, the mentality of \"I am right, all other answers are wrong\" that pisses me off so much about her. We have LS courses to engage in discussion, to share thoughts and ideas, not to simply be instructed that there is only one way to look at something. Take for example, this one paper that I wrote for her African American Lit course. When you wrote abour a book, there were only a handful of different themes you could write about for your paper, and I did not care for that at all. That's the beauty of literature, it can be interpreted in so many different ways to so many different people, saying that you must get x, y or z out of it is just wrong in my opinion. I don't know, maybe I'm just crazy here, but I don't care very much for that.",

That's the only math class I've ever struggled in. And I've taken a lot of challenging math courses (BVP and Partial Dif Eq)\nThe main problem with her curriculum was the distribution of points. If I remember correctly the midterm and final exam were both worth 40% of the final grade, which is fucking ridiculous (80% total). No final exam should ever be worth that much. HW assignments and programming assignments were worth 20% total. There were no quizes. You had no idea how well you were doing in the class until 6-7th week after she graded the midterm. But even if you get a B on the midterm you can still end up failing the class if you completely bomb the final exam (which for her is very common).\n\nThis professor is actually the only prof I had to go to the department head to complain about. I went there with 2 other guys who were part of the Beta Theta Pi frat (highest average gpa on campus at the time). We were all incredibly  upset with how she taught the course. I've talked to friends who had her after I graduated, it sounds like she hasn't changed a bit. Avoid her at all costs if you want to save your gpa. She's the only class I got below a B in.",

            "comment": "Here are my opinions as a Junior II CS Major:\n\n\\*Best\\*\n\nHuggins: Undoubtedly the best professor in the CS department (but I would say the CS professors as a whole are pretty good). Very clearly cares about students, and is willing to help or make accommodations if something goes wrong; I confused a virtual exam due date once, and Huggins was totally cool about it and let me submit it a little late. Also, he makes class entertaining. More so in person, because he has some interesting demonstrations in early CS courses, but he is also not boring to listen to. Not to mention, he was a shining example when the pandemic began of how to treat students who are all trying to adjust to a new way of learning.\n\nMarra: LIT department, I'm having once of his courses for the first time now and it might sound too early to make a judgment, but he legitimately makes class enjoyable. Funniest professor ever, no dull moments in his class.\n\nHennicken: Probably the best MATH professor that I only failed the first time because I was a dipshit freshman who couldn't get with the program yet. Helpful like no other.\n\nTurini: Funny CS professor who is very approachable outside of class. Lively personality. Kind of disappointed I haven't had a class of his more than once.\n\nHayrapetyan: I had a solid understanding of Calc-II after his class. Would make our small class do problems on the board, but it actually motivated me to know what I was doing.\n\n\\*Worst\\*\n\nDimitrov: MATH. Another professor I'm having for the first time, but I promise it's not too early to make a judgment. What can I say other than he cannot form coherent sentences? Nothing makes sense. I simply cannot fathom how he is employed. If you take his class now you get the added bonus of watching him draw even worse than normal (virtually). At the least, I don't have any reason to believe that he isn't a nice guy. Biostatistics this term is going to be a rough one, I think.\n\nStanchev: The worst CS professor. Suffers in the same way as Dimitrov but with a slightly better ability to understand what he is saying and doing. The thing is, I can handle a mumbler, and I can handle a heavy accent. But mumbling AND a heavy accent makes it difficult to understand. Angrily yelled at me in particular during class once because I wasn't done with a practice problem yet. Easy grade, but it's possible to learn nothing -- I would recommend standalone electives with this guy only.\n\nTurgman/Cohen: BIO. Was probably a fine instructor to be honest, but he's here because (and no I cannot explain this whatsoever) he had a fucking screaming little kid in our room when we were taking our final exam.\n\nKanchi: CS. Not terrible, but bad enough to be at the barely-tolerable end of this list. Class was an information overload.\n\nAnyone else I had is just average. Sorry about writing a whole light novel lmao.",

Both suck at teaching you stuff, but at least Stanchev isn't a dick about it (I mean, average grade on one of his tests in Intro to Game Design was like 50 something....so he just gave everyone an A on it because none of us actually understood the stuff).",

Not to mention bringing in coffee, orange juice, and bagels on the day of a test, before covid obviously. She is basically an angle   \n\n\nWorst: Tebeest - this man does not care about your grade or the students. He is not useful in office hours, and is no longer allowed to teach calc 3 since so many kids dropped/failed the course the semester he taught it.",

A close follow up is Salacuse, I had him the term he said \"It is patriotic to come to class\" and he didn't believe in covid.\nBest: Henniken (but everyone has said that). Jen Rivet, she's an angel. Montsy is great too, very accommodating.",

I had him last semester for economics, and between the accent, the mask, and the not-great mic (online) it was harder to understand him. Beyond that, though he would give the online students a short-answer test/exam and the in-person students a multiple-choice exam; holding them to entirely different standards. I went to him multiple times, the department head twice, and the ASC to try to get it to be the same standard and I got absolutely *nowhere*.   \n\n\nEventually ended up just driving 5 hours (round trip) to Kettering on days of tests just to take the easier one, got As on the in-person and I think barely a C on the online. Ridiculous.",

            "comment": "So I know it\u2019s not popular at all, but in all honesty Cheng is my favorite professor. I\u2019m a math major, so I had two of the hardest math courses in the university (Real Analysis and Complex Variables) taught by her. She explained the material very well and though I had to work really hard in both classes at no time did I think she was being unfair with the workload, her demands, or homework.\n\nNow I do understand why some people would be upset with her grading style and very hard tests (yea, they are very difficult), but I\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t really care about the grade rather what I actually learn, and because I\u2019ve learned so much in her classes she gets put at the top for me. However I get it if she is not at the top (or even at the bottom) of your list.\n\nAs for least favorite, hands down Dimitrov. I think I got dumber by listening to Dimitrov. Never should a man who doesn\u2019t come to class prepared with any notes, and can\u2019t even do the student\u2019s homework, be allowed to even teach at a community college let alone Kettering. I am actively trying to get him fired.\n\nHonorable mention for Hassold being the worst prof for just being terrible to me as a freshman",

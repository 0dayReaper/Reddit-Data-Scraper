Percentage wise, this salary increase would be the same as someone going from $40k a year to $70k a year in the span of about 7 years which is totally plausible; however, a difference of $30k and $300k in salary are vastly different, especially given the cost of living. In any case, the graph would be misleading: one would be mathematically misleading; the other misleading socioeconomically. As stated earlier, this graph was made mostly for dramatic effect and also to inform Kettering students, alumni, and staff how much a certain position's salary has changed in the past 7ish years. One may draw their own conclusions from the limited data given. Thanks for pointing this out!",

The only reason you can analyze the President's salary is that it's public information (because of the IRS Form 990s).    \n\n\nBut, as u/ku-mythbuster says below, context is important.   In any organization, the CEO gets paid more than the custodial staff.",

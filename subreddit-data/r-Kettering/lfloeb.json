You can get by listening to the lectures and taking notes, especially for the calculations, but I found it very helpful to have cribs to at least have something to base my reports off of. Without the cribs, there would\u2019ve been no way I could go from A-Z. Also, if you don\u2019t want to have to focus on the whole lecture every week, you can delegate one member of your group to focus on certain parts each week and switch off.",

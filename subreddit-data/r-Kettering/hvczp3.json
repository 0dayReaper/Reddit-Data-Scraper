    "postText": "OK. I don't mean to be the student who rants about how Kettering isn't worth it online, but there are some SERIOUS quality issues with the delivery of education for us, and the school needs to listen, and not pretend that everything is okay.  \n\n\nBesides the loss of value (less time allowed on campus, clubs going online, technical issues, co-ops being reduced, etc.), the way classes are being delivered, at least for me, just doesn't work. Kettering faculty aren't trained to deliver online classes, at least from a content delivery standpoint.  \n\n\nFrom my experience so far, almost all my professors are teaching off of handwritten notes or prepared presentations. This is fine, except for the glaring issue of having extremely limited time to write down notes and work out problems. One of my classes has the professor simply reading over his already worked out problems (which are already hard to follow). They couldn't provide all faculty with writing tablets?\n\nCombine this with technical issues, and already constrained course timelines, content is SUPER rushed. Worse than normal. This actually leaves me more busy than usual with the excess work outside of class. There are so many more issues that could be listed, but I doubt the school will acknowledge any of them.  \n\n\nRant over. I don't feel like using a throwaway, so this is my opinion. Great reddit username choice, right? Anyone else face these problems?",

If you walk across the room and have the mic on the other side, we cant hear you. They should've forced all the staff to practice using online equipment and rotate. Salacuse is pretty rough, but professors like P. Atkinson I feel like are killing it. Professors need to adjust their methods to accommodate this new environment, using writing pads vs drawing on the board when working out problems.",

Not to mention any kind of closed-captioning system.\n\nI've heard lots of people say \"The profs have it so hard\" but tbh my classes are all still designed to be delivered in-person, other than some paper assignments being blackboard assignments instead. I'm not sure how much extra work they had to put in other than learning their ways around lecturing via blackboard, which they all have a TA to help with anyways.",

But the fact that cost was not reduced is ridiculous. I\u2019m attending 100% virtually this term, so I am not utilizing any on campus resources. Yet I still paid over 10 grand for this term after my scholarships and loans are taken out.",

            "comment": "I certainly agree that things like wireless lav mics or well trained TA's would greatly increase the synchronous experience. Some professors are almost completely incompatible with the online environment, and others do just fine. As someone who took classes last term (Spring, 100% online) and is currently taking classes I gotta say (at the risk of sounding like a boomer), this term is *way* better of an experience. \n\nThere are certain realities of going to school right now, and Kettering's problems are certainly not unique. The decision to not change the tuition is just that - a decision. Just like the decision we all made to register for classes in this environment, knowing exactly the way everything was going to happen once we got to school. I know people who noped out and are waiting this thing out before they continue - not an option for everyone, but still an option for some. \n\nPersonally, I'm perfectly fine with the way everything is going down right now. Shitty profs exist, even in person. Technical issues set back class a lot further these days, but it's better for me to be in classes that have *some* issues than none at all. Kettering reducing the tuition would be great, because the experience is worse than in-person, but my two-cents is that the experience is not that much worse and we all signed up for it.\n\nWe just need to focus on helping Kettering improve our experience - email your profs and voice your concerns. It's not that hard to ask a Professor to stand near a microphone, or to slow down the lecture a bit... 99% of the time you'll be voicing everyone's opinion. We are all in this now, students and profs alike. Let's try and make it as good as it can be.",

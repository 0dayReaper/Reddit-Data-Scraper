Seems like the schedule options are super specific and have a bunch of overlaps on classes I would like to knock out at the same time (major specific).

Kettering doesn't have enough faculty to offer multiple sections of upper-level courses in most non-ME programs, so you have to build a schedule with what you have.   Talk to your EE academic advisor to get some help in building a reasonable schedule that moves you forward.\n\n(We could hire a bunch more faculty to offer more sections, but that would increase tuition, and nobody thinks that Kettering's tuition is too low, right?)",

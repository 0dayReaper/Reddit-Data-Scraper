From what I read, they prioritized classes with a lab component to be face to face, so if you have a class with no lab component, it might be fully online.\n\nAnother thing is if you wish to attend an in person class virtually (via livestream), you have to talk to the professor since it is up to them on how they want to handle student interaction. Hopefully courses post their syllabus by this weekend so we have a better idea on how attendance will work.\n\nLink to the Fall 2020 playbook for those who need it: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1omQGC5e03WsmZszerpMDqMvbDhyPPpo0/view",

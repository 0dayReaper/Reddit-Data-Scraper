I kept one of those big packs of ramen from Walmart around and usually had small microwave macaroni bowls or pizza rolls.\n\nThe dorms, I admit, are kinda small and really boring to sit around in. I personally found my room to be hell because it just felt like prison, so definitely go out, make friends, and be social. I got super depressed because I didn't do that. There's Greek Life of course, as well as many clubs on campus, plus any study groups you have along the way.\n\nI would personally advise that you check out the Greek Life on campus, find where you fit best, or figure out if Greek isn't for you. It's cheaper to not live in the dorms (you have to be there for your first term, must pay for your second term as well, but you don't have to move in for the second term. Just get your key at check-in).\n\nOf course, bring your essentials, whatever you need to stay comfy for the 6-12 hours you'll be in your room (unless you choose to be a hermit). Free time comes and goes your first year, so use it to your advantage.",

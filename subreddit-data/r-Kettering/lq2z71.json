    "postText": "Students,\n\nPlease don't hold us professors accountable for our abusive feedback on your exams. You *earn* those remarks. And whatever you do, definitely do NOT take it to the Provost because we might get into some trouble for our... behavior. Maybe try leaking it to the news? At least then McMahan would have to make some kind of explanation for us as we don't want our methodologies to be public. Might cost us our careers or something like that.\n\nAnyway, put up with it or just do better, don't do anything that would actually help you raise awareness of academic abuse.\n\nOh, and there's several students on here that should attend my office hours so they can earn some extra credit.",

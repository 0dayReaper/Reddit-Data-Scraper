If the people we depend on to enforce the rules refuse to follow them, then we will be online only indefinitely. We need to hold each other to a higher standard if we want to keep carrying on.",

Per Ketterings email sent out a few minutes ago, those are the only cases (besides an employee). Now the house is being tested and everyone who attended the rush events for the fraternity should get tested asap (even if they got tested this week).\n\nSo there really isn't an outbreak yet but if more people start testing positive then we have a problem.",

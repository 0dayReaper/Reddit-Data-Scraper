I'm fully vaccinated and was told I would get an email if I needed to stay home because of a potential exposure. I have no email telling me to quarantine, yet I have a red screen even after answering all the questions. I'm just trying to gauge how big this problem is.",

            "comment": "Hahaha, funny story: Kettering stopped sending out contact tracing emails. I am in the same situation as you (vaccinated, no email about exposure) but it turns out I WAS exposed and the only reason I know this was because I got a blackboard announcement from my professor, nothing official from Kettering. So you were exposed, kettering is just choosing not to tell you when and how!",

If the Wellness Center (for students) or HR Office (for employees) has not already contacted you, they will shortly.*\n\n*However, please note that as we transition the system this evening to no longer using the gold screen for those who have been vaccinated, your cell phone may temporarily display a red screen until about 11:00 p.m. tonight.  We apologize for any inconvenience or confusion this may have caused.*\n\n*Tom Ayers*\n\n*Vice President for Administration &amp; Finance*",

    "postText": "With Spring term just ending, and final grades being reported last Friday, reference the class syllabus and check to make sure there wasn't an error in calculations somewhere. \n\nI just checked a grade for one of my classes that I was given a B+, when I thought I atleaat got an A-, borderline A (if he wanted to round). When I emailed said prof, he confirmed that there was a mess up and my grade was actually higher than what he sent, and is taking care of it. Professors make mistakes sometimes, especially when they have multiple, fully packed classes.",

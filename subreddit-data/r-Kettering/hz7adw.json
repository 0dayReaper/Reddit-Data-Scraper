I think things should be re-organized so all the classes that \\*can\\* be online (theory, math, programming) should be, and then have labs on campus using the equipment that's available.\n\nOr just close the campus, give refunds, and try again the next semester?  Who knows.  This whole situation is horrible and needs to be controlled.  Hopefully there will be a vaccine soon and everyone can return to campus.\n\nEither way, tuition needs to be lowered for the lowered quality of the classes.  They can't expect students to pay top dollar for a bargin-basement education, which is what they're getting at this point.\n\nIf I was a KU student at this time, I'd probably withdraw and switch to a cheaper university.  Not that my opinion helps, but if I'm not getting the education I'm paying for, I'd want to take my money elsewhere.",

Freshman/first year Sophomore with shaky co-op?  Transfer and deal with the fallout.  Junior/Senior with a decent co-op and chance for thesis?  Don't.\n\nThis really depends on your co-op situation though.  THAT is the most important part of the equation.  If you have one that could hire you on at the end of it, I would totally stay.  \n\nHonestly, the only reason to go to KU is the co-op and desire to work in the audo industry.  If the co-op is up in the air or you can't get one for \\*hand waves at the economy\\* reasons, switch to a more regular school.",

Just another reason that \"Sorry guys, you opted into the Kettering's tuition when you opted to go to Kettering! The university takes no responsibility, you can leave if you don't like it :/\" is a bullshit answer.\n\nThe problem with that \"solution\" is that Kettering is so much more concerned about their image in the eyes of public and prospective students than the experience of the current students, that you only realize how much of a let-down it is once you've already been locked-in (via any or all of the following factors: monetary investment, commitment to a co-op employer, non-traditional schedule, and non-transferable credit hours). I guess that's capitalism for you though. Cash &gt;&gt;&gt; quality.",

All that work I did at school to get my degree will be moot.  All jobs out there (at least in engineering, from what I've seen) \\*require\\* ABET accreditation.  Not sure what to say if it gets pulled.\n\nI also agree about the fact that KU is more interested in their image than in the actual experience of current students.  I see nothing has changed since I was a student there!\n\nHonestly, for what the student body is paying, they should be getting the highest quality education possible.  What KU taught me was how to work and manage time effectively, what with the 20 credits and upwards of 50 hours of work required per week.  Somehow I survived, but it's kind of soured me on doing unpaid overtime for an employer.   I did the extra time in school and don't want to have \"homework\" after work that I have to deal with.",

            "comment": "The way that it seemed to me was having the intent to keep the school in person and limit contact in case someone did test positive for the virus. Weeks ago now a professor did test positive and the only action taken was to keep them off campus. By the time that students became symptomatic, regardless of where they may have contracted it, s similar response was made by the school to keep it off campus. Personally I believe that they should have been more on top of limiting what activities they were allowing particularly after they knew it was potentially within the Kettering community. Clubs in person meetings should have been more limited to online if classes weren't in full swing and maybe not doing neither in person or online classes at 50% each but one or the other at full strength would have been better. If you weren't comfortable going 100% in person why would you be comfortable going 50% and lowering the quality of education.\n\nAnd for people hoping for a quick and easy vaccine it's not going to eliminate the measures to stop covid on its own for at least another year assuming production of the vaccine is maximized and it's a uniquely effective vaccine. Schools might however be one of the first areas to receive doses as they house a large population that commonly interacts closely with one another. Kettering won't need to be online in the coming year particularly if that's the case, but the more something spreads now the more it will be able to spread in a little while. The whole shelter in place and keep your distance thing was good to get numbers trending downwards but that doesn't mean everything is perfect for us to be in person. And when students bitch about the tuition at letting being too high, it is without scholarships or if you don't have a co-op with the scholarships, but I've found it relatively affordable compared to similar options, my only question is why offer the huge scholarships and make others pay, why not normalize the price to keep students happy. When students bitch about stuff like the school is too expensive for online, they're commenting on the price you're charging for the service and providing a lesser service with this online hybrid at the same price does nothing to improve that. Some profs taught incredibly well over B sections online term but  there were others who couldn't manage with blackboard or basic computer functions to get a message across to a class. Blackboard doesn't do everything very well, but it was normally a prof dropping the ball that had students upset. Not having class in the same location every week or not posting assignments to blackboard only showing the form in class made the term very rough. If you're worried about Letterings reputation being ruined by pass fail maybe it's time to consider the profs teaching at the school and whether the reputation you have is as a \"good school\" from alum or instead \"trial by fire\" and the students that make it are stubborn enough to spend the extra 15-60k to graduate or were able to cheat their way through a course the prod taught nothing about in lectures. Sure there are a good portion of people who study their asses off and cut a couple of years off of their lives attending but they're not the people who spread Kettering name as loudly as the ones who disagree with how it ran.\n\nJust ranting because I'm upset and it's the Kettering pastime. Happy day everyone.\n\nP.S. Sodexo is still shit",

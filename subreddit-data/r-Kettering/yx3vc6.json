There's so much more out there. \n\nI had two terms at Ford and really hated it there the first term so I found a new position and quit. I've landed multiple positions that pay over double and I am learning way more things than I ever did at Ford or in class. Since I'm just doing internship roles, I'm fulfilling my thesis requirement with the research thesis option. Find a professor you know and see if they have research for you if you want to go this route.",

In fact it seems to be a common problem with Kettering students, getting co-ops but learning nothing.\n\nReach out to your co-op and academic advisors related to your thesis about this issue, and if you really feel like you\u2019re not gaining anything out of it, then just quit. \n\nYou\u2019ll lose more in the long run sitting on your ass all day than proactively focusing on your thesis. Trust me, that was my biggest mistake.",

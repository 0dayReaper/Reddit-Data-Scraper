    "postText": "  \n\nThis week on Wednesday (July 22nd), KSG hosted a town hall with Dr. McMahan. Below are several bits of information that we learned from it that have not been previously mentioned. Keep in mind, these questions were vetted after the first 20 minutes of questions went through. (This happened after it was asked if McMahan would take responsibility for an outbreak) The first 3 questions are from memory, as I do not have the recording for that portion of the meeting. I attempted to write down as much as I could remember once I decided to make this post, but there will be missed pieces of information. The final questions are paraphrased from the recording I took.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: The school has so far only offered 3 days of optional testing to students, with only 60 slots available next Tuesday (7/28). How does your administration plan to handle an outbreak?\n\nA: There have been 2 confirmed cases on campus. I recommend that all Greek Presidents mandate testing for all members. In regard to the limited 60 student testing slots, I do not know where this number came from, and any student is able to just walk in during the testing hours and get tested.\n\n \\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: I and others have voiced issues regarding our ability to connect to Blackboard Collaborate and KU Cloud. What is being done to improve these services?\n\nA: If you have a problem, it helps us if you tell us information. That is actually very helpful to the IT team to help identify the issues and they will fix this in real-time. Another thing is that I would encourage those of you who are living in large groups like fraternity houses to ask yourselves 'are you the only one in your house that is having these issues on your network?\u2019 If you\u2019re having these issues in your house, please let them know that.\n\nQ: Myself and others have had several issues with KU Cloud freezing on our computers. It\u2019s my understanding that everyone who would normally use on-campus resources must not access it from home. Could this be putting a bit too much strain on the network to work well? \n\nA: We have invested in increased capabilities when we virtualized all the labs. We do monitor the load on KU Cloud. It is a network-dependent device so some of the issues I discussed before can influence it. But I will follow up on this. We have been monitoring it, and as of right now we are operating far below the load limit.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: How did Kettering come to the decision to partially reopen during the pandemic?\n\nA: The decision was largely driven by students\u2019 desire to return to campus. We\u2019ve always been committed to bringing students back if we can, safely, and in an effective way. The situation is not static. I appreciate everyone\u2019s patience and understanding with an ever-changing situation. Consider also the progression of the thinking that got us here. Each decision is based on the current context at the time of the decision, and not what we have come to know at this time. So far, our plans for returning to campus have been working well. \n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: Regarding the general frustration among students, the big frustration currently is that the regular resources available to students are unavailable. We pay a lot of money every semester. Normally we have resources and features but this term we are barely able to function. When will some of these reopen?\n\nA: Dr. Svinarich, the Associate Provost, oversees a lot of these resources, so I\u2019m going to let her address this. \u2013 Dr. Svinarich: I\u2019m part of the team that has tried to provide some services for you on campus and get you back to face to face safely. Being in phase 4 as a state, we must be careful with the number of students somewhere. We are evaluating the situation and as soon as possible we would like to re-open the library. There are spaces available for students to use currently though.\n\nQ: How are you still able to justify the full tuition cost given the lack of resources available to us?\n\nA: It is our plan to open as much as we can as quickly as we can. Many schools across the country are opting to go virtual, but they are not reducing their tuition to do it.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: Many students (freshmen) don\u2019t think they will return next semester and instead take classes at a community college to avoid the cost of Kettering since it is practically entirely online.\n\nA: 97% of students are in face to face instruction. Yes, you can opt to be online, but that is additional complexity, not a reduction. If anything, we are opening more than anyone else would.\n\n \\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: What is the accuracy of the COVID tests being provided by Kettering? Also, how many positive tests have come back so far?\n\nA: There were two (positive tests), and one was from someone who had never been on campus but was coming to our campus.\n\n**\\*NOTE\\*** When asked about the second case, McMahan repeated the aforementioned info instead of telling us the location of the other case.\n\nRegarding the accuracy, I do not know. We are not doing the test; an approved laboratory is. It is a standard swab test though.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n Q: I have had issues with Blackboard and was directed by IT to reach out to BB directly. Do you have any recommendations for issues like this?\n\nA: I have no knowledge of an issue like this. Reach out to the provost office if you have more issues.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: Students are having issues getting co-ops due to COVID. How is the university going to help with this?\n\nA: We are actively working with students and employers to get students\u2019 co-ops back. If you are having an issue with your co-op, reach out to your co-op manager. We also established the emergency fund to assist students. There are also resources on campus to help students complete their thesis requirements. This includes us reducing the requirements for a Thesis, such as the alternative thesis options provided by the Thesis Office.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: How does contact tracing work? Are students able to get their tests back? If a positive case occurs, will the campus as a whole find out?\n\nA: Contact tracing works differently if it is a student or faculty. We identify who was infected and anyone who could have been in contact. The situation changes if the person in question lives in group housing. We\u2019ve already enforced quarantining on the positive cases we have had. If there is a positive test, the entire campus will **NOT** be notified, just the individual.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: How did COVID affect A section enrollment?\n\nA: Enrollment is down for both sections, but not by a significant amount. Approximately 170 students opted to live in Thompson Hall.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: Is there a way for students to receive the results of their COVID tests directly?\n\nA: Reach out to the Wellness Center for this information.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: If there is an outbreak on campus, is the university prepared to take responsibility and assist the students?\n\nA: We are there for the students and have prepared for that possibility.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: Will the university be opening an investigation into Professor Gebissa?\n\nA: We are not at liberty to discuss this, but we are aware of the situation and there is an active investigation underway.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: Why is Kettering not lowing tuition, besides \u201cother schools aren\u2019t lowering tuition.\u201d\n\nA: Answering this question will not do it justice and it's not appropriate for me to answer it in a format like this. But it does come down to what you are paying for in your tuition. We provide an environment and don\u2019t charge piecemeal.\n\nQ: But you aren\u2019t providing a complete environment\n\nA: In a way we are. If you look at the majority of the cost, the largest cost is faculty salary. \n\nQ: The faculty are great, but I came to Kettering for the resources it provides, not the faculty. And those are unavailable right now.\n\nA: That\u2019s not true in entirety. The classes and labs are operating. The teachers are there and available to you. The value of the degree and courses are unchanged. So, you may not be able to walk-in anywhere at any time, but you could never do that. We are compromised societally. If I go to my favorite restaurant, I am not charged less if I eat outside. \n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nQ: Is it possible with proper processes to access the entirety of the thesis archive?\n\nA: (Dr. Svinarich) Copywrite laws make this difficult, even if there are no confidentiality clauses in place by the company. You can, however, request to see a thesis through the Thesis Office.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nFinal remarks - Thank you for coming, this was a good discussion. I appreciate your input and if you run into operational issues let us know. Take care and stay healthy.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nTLDR: McMahan refuses to take responsibility for anything that has/will occur.",

Has student engagement in their own governance increased to improve circumstances?\n\nKSG has a lot more power than is realized when ran properly. KSG could work to make a partnership with community colleges to avoid the perceived undue costs during the epidemic. It\u2019s not a bad idea and would push against anti-competitive practice to hopefully help students who need it. \n\nStay safe. I will just say that despite the poor circumstances, I\u2019ve seen Dr. McMahan take more responsibility over Kettering than any past GMI President ever has; will the students meet him halfway with nuance and democratic discourse or inflammatory rhetoric?\n\nAs permaworkterm students will realize, we are all in charge of our own enlightenment and education at the end of the day. Universities are a tool to help with this and expose ourselves to different ideas and people. Help fix this as citizens who are collectively having difficulties.\n\n\u201cIf there is a lesson in all of this it is that our Constitution is neither a self-actuating nor a self-correcting document. It requires the constant attention and devotion of all citizens. There is a story, often told, that upon exiting the Constitutional Convention Benjamin Franklin was approached by a group of citizens asking what sort of government the delegates had created. His answer was: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\" The brevity of that response should not cause us to under-value its essential meaning: democratic republics are not merely founded upon the consent of the people, they are also absolutely dependent upon the active and informed involvement of the people for their continued good health.\u201d\n\nhttps://constitutioncenter.org/learn/educational-resources/historical-documents/perspectives-on-the-constitution-a-republic-if-you-can-keep-it",

As I'm sure you're well aware KSG does not hold the right to send out mass emails to the entire student body. r/Kettering is how we currently come together to voice complaints. \n\nKSG only holds so much power. Currently, they are only allowed on campus half the week in accordance with the mandated Kettering playbook. Furthermore, how do you expect the KSG president to speak out for his peers when he gets muted during the Town Hall meeting? You cite a perspective on the constitution, does this not sound like censorship to you? \n\nI'm confused by your comment on KSG working with community colleges. Could you please elaborate on that? I think it's a really good idea. I'd like to know how exactly you think this would work.\n\nNo one is saying Dr. McMahan isn't doing everything he can for this University. What we are saying is he needs to be held more accountable. Something older generations seem to forget is that blind pride is toxic. I've heard stories about the hurdles McMahan had to go through to fix the past president's mistakes. Just because he's done a few good things does not give him the right to put students' lives at risk. Additionally, you ask us to meet him halfway but he silences us in person and online. \n\nFinally, you say that our permaworkterm teaches us that \"we are all in charge of our own enlightenment and education at the end of the day.\" That's exactly what we're doing. McMahan works for the students not the stakeholders, something he seems to have forgotten. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy very last remark is, hello McMahan.  You are failing Kettering. Your lack of leadership and transparency and willingness to throw students under the bus is unacceptable. Take some accountability or get out. We need a president that will not only listen to our concerns but act on them. McMahan, you need to shape up or ship out.",

Past presidents were proud of the heritage of this school, saw promise in its students, and didn't join a public forum of those students calling themselves a \"VeryDisappointedAlum\" from the safety of their own mansion.

You can preview it by looking in DegreeWorks and doing a \"what-if\" analysis.   It is my understanding that existing students can opt-into the new curriculum once it becomes active (i.e. in July).",

I have conflicting thoughts about it devaluing my degree as a recent-ish alumni and the desire to have a higher graduation rate to make the school more marketable. I personally like the degree broadening requirements that are being removed as they have been vital to many careers.\n\nWhat would you consider the measures to determine whether this policy is \u201csuccessful\u201d?",

                                    "comment": "IMHO, the \"value\" of a degree isn't dependent on what specific courses you took as much as whether or not you're prepared for the \"forty-year work term\".  We all know that the half-life of the knowledge of specific coursework is pretty short, especially in technology fields.  So, the question becomes: are these extra courses helping that preparation or not?\n\nI would've liked to keep the extra electives, too.   At the same time, as a practical matter, the extra electives were largely an annoyance to students who were \"ready\" to move on.   (We can see this by the number of students who transfer in those courses during work terms so that they can graduate faster.)\n\nI'm not sure there's a defined \"success metric\", other than (as you suggested) graduation rates.  \n\nAnd someone will point out that we're not forbidding students from taking that extra term of courses.   Anyone who wants to stay another term and take those courses can still do so.  It's only time and money, right?  :)",

After y'all graduate, it's important to us that you feel like your experience at Kettering was valuable.  Obviously we want you to do well.  As a practical matter, too, we hope that you'll refer more students to us, and hire them as co-op students.  (And, yes, we hope you'll donate some money back to us.)\n\nA big part of how y'all feel about Kettering, of course, is how Kettering treated you over the years.  In particular, the final impressions matter a great deal.  In the Bad Old Days^(TM), Kettering seemed to excel at pissing off students just as they were graduating, which really made alumni relationships hard.   (Students would tell us that they felt more connection with their co-op employer and their Greek Life organization than the University.)   We've made some progress over the years in eliminating some of the most egregious policies that pissed off graduating students.   The 141-credit plan might help further some of that goodwill as well.\n\nHow do you measure that?   I don't know that you can.  It's a long-term problem, and you can't measure long-term improvements easily.   But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try anyways.",

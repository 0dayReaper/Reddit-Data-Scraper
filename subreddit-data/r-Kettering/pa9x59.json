    "postText": "I\u2019m done with Kettering\u2019s ridiculous covid policies. I will be attending online until they, at MINIMUM, reverse this latest series of policies, and I encourage other students to consider doing the same.\n\nHere's an idea: if Kettering was simply trying to avoid liability, they could have all students and staff who wished to go maskless sign a liability waiver. \n\nInstead, this administration is drunk on power. Their illogical and unscientific mandates and their poorly handled quarantining efforts are negatively impacting the staff and student body.\n\nThe door checkpoints were bad enough. Now, they\u2019ve cancelled indoor clubs while continuing in person classes, re-imposed mask mandates (why invade our privacy and ask for vaccination proof then?)\u2026enough is enough.",

If you're not vaccinated, you're not a student, period (with extremely limited exceptions).\n\nAnd, yes, just because someone else does it doesn't mean it's right or wrong for us to do it.   I'm just pointing out that the current requirements aren't nearly as onerous as they could be.",

We gotta do something about it, taking classes from home, which is even more safe than wearing a mask, will really show them they don\u2019t need these dumb rules.",

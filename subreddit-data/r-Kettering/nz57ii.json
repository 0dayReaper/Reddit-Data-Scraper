    "postText": "Just posting a little vent or whatever on how much I'm 100% screwed.\n\nCo-op requires a 2.95 for me to join\n\nECE 101: A- / A depending on how the final goes, based on literally A being 95 for some reason\n\nMATH 204 w/ Hayrapetyan - at a D with PID project and final to go (most finals were just me dying), HW is an A though.\n\nCE  210 w/ Tabrizi - at an F, basically from each exam (Even though they're all online.. I'm just trash) with the final left (Labs are an A)\n\nPHYS 224 w/ Obsniuk, - A-/A Depending on how the final goes. I'm pretty good at knowing what I'm doing for that class. \n\n  \nDiscrete Maths - B+ (Guest credit, but probably won't count)\n\nI'm probably screwed entirely.. It's unfortunate that I'm on a time crunch due to my co-op wanting me to graduate by Spring 2023. I really want this co-op, though. I understand that I have to put in a bunch of time for this. With that being said.. is there anything that I could do besides study my butt off and hope for the best? I've gotten in contact with both CE and MATH professors. CE I feel that I have a good chance of recovering to a C or B.   \n\n\nI feel that MATH is just going to be downright terrible. At this point secretly, I feel that the prof already dislikes me. I'm still going to try and keep reaching out and asking for help etc.. but I'm honestly at a loss and if I lose this co-op I have no clue what will happen next.  \n\n\nI took discrete math as a guest credit.. so if all comes to worse it acts as a \"buffer\" for my grades, but I don't think it'll be calculated into the GPA, unless I somehow talk to the co-op and send both transcripts?\n\nI'm just really at a loss right now for how I should go about these next few days.",

A CR to my knowledge **does not** factor in to your GPA.\n\nTo echo what Cproo12 said, *go to the ASC before this happens*. I almost found myself in a similar situation when I took General Chemistry II, 3 years ago. I was fortunate I got help and ended up pulling a C up to a B- before the end of the term.\n\nAs for the co-op end, you might want to talk to HR at the company or whoever does the hiring for co-ops about your grade situation. They might be understanding and let you slide through with some conditions. My co-op did this for me once when I needed it, I just had to make sure the next term I came back, I met the minimum GPA requirement. If you end up loosing your co-op, the co-op office would be happy to help you find a new one, so I wouldn't worry too much about that.\n\nAlso, keep in mind you can always get a grade replacement for a course as long as you retake the class again within a year.",

(Otherwise, there would be too many shenanigans.)     \n\nThe suggestion about retaking the course later to replace the grade is also worth considering in the long run, but (a) that obviously requires time, and (b) doesn't help with the short-term problem.",

    "postText": "So I have a 9 am online class that\u2019s supposed to go for an hour and then a 10:15 on campus, and I live about 25 minutes away. Am I supposed to just never go to class in person, or leave my 9 am early? I understand the classes are designed so you can do them fully online, but it seems odd they\u2019d even let something like that get scheduled in the first place.",

Sounds like you'll have to do that online class from somewhere closer to campus if you want to make sure you're on time for the 10:15. \n\nIs there library or any computer lab or lounge open up for you to do your 9am from, while on campus?\n\nYou could always tether your phone to your laptop and finish up one class while driving to the other.",

I am hoping the professors will be understanding and will not care if you are a few minutes late. Unfortunately the library\u2019s and Dspaces are still closed or else I would do my online class on campus.",

I have a similar situation, and I'm just assuming that the presumed solution for that problem is to do both classes virtually. If you really want to be in-person whenever you can, then idk because you can't look at any visuals the instructor has while you're driving to campus. Maybe recording your screen while you do it will be better so you can catch the end of the lecture later.",

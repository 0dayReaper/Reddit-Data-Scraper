I read the other post about you not wanting to use honorlock and the material being difficult \u2014 you would think there would be more gratitude based on how much students complained about honorlock and how many students always want to take a take home exam. I just want to let you know that other students do truly appreciate these efforts you put forth. I hope you figure out a solution to this situation",

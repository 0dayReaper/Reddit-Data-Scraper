(Edit: we host our website on the same unsecured network as the unsecured system. We love network engineers, am I right?)\n\nI already got several notices about my identity getting stolen by my private loan company and the IRS and it's been 3 months since the breach and I'm off of government identity protection. (Got that when I was 16 because the government had a breach, lol.)\n\n\n\nTL;DR: has anyone else's employer fuck up data security so bad that even a random dude off the street could walk in with a flash drive and steal everyone's identities?\n\nCan't wait to have my credit score get fucked in the ass.",

            "comment": "Sounds like whoever is in charge of data security at said company needs to be fired immediately... \n\n[This link](https://www.identitytheft.gov/steps) has some good steps to follow to miniate the damage of identity theft. Also as u/OutrageousSeesaw said, freezing your credit would be a good idea.\n\nThis next part is long but these are general digital privacy and security tips I usually recommend to everyone. TLDR for the below stuff is: opt out of all the data broker sites to get your information to stop circulating around and get a password manager to manage passwords. Also, try not to use duplicate passwords and enable 2 Factor Authentication on every account you can.\n\n**On the privacy end:**\n\nIf you have a bit of time to set aside, you can go through [this list of data brokers](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List) and opt out of them. (legally they have to let you opt out of their \"service\"). O*nce the information is removed from the site (which may take a few days), make sure you have google update the search result using their* [remove outdated content tool](https://search.google.com/search-console/remove-outdated-content).\n\nWith the above I also recommend using Google Dorking to search for your information online. If you search something in quotes ie: \"Pizza\". The only results that should come up are pages with the word Pizza in the title or in the content. You can do this with your name, address, phone number or any identifying information about yourself to see what sites have them.\n\nMost of the times you can go to the site and see if they have a way to opt out of them displaying your data. Or if its a site like [pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com) where anyone can copy and paste data, you can report the paste to the site admins citing that your personal information is in there and they will remove it within a few days (this happened to my Spotify account way back ago).\n\n**On the security end:**\n\nYou can check what breaches your email and phone number have been involved in using [this site](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).\n\nI recommend putting 2 Factor Authentication on all of your accounts ASAP. Not every service allows it, but most do, you can check which sites do and don't [here](https://2fa.directory/). SMS/Email are the standard methods of 2FA but there is a third option where you can use 2FA tokens to log in to services which will sync a secret token between you and the server. Then you can use an app like [Authy](https://authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US) to sync the token to your phone. Some password managers also might support having the token being generated in their app which makes it a nice all in one solution.\n\nOn the topic of password managers, I also recommend getting a password manager, randomizing all of your passwords and just using the password manager to log in. Most (if not all) password managers are cross platform and easy to use. Some common ones that are very secure are [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/) and [1password](https://1password.com/). If your password was leaked and you reuse a password, this will stop random people from logging in to your stuff and doing unauthorized purchases or dumb stuff to your account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI use the privacy and security methods I have described above for myself. It takes **a lot** of time to get everything situated and working, unfortunately it is not a thing that can happen in one night. If you want some clarification, PM me and I'd be happy to help. Best of luck!\n\nSource: I'm a Computer Science major",

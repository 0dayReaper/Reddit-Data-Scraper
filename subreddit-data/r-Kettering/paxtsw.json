They're made of polypropylene fibers that are essentially mashed together and ultrasonically welded around the edges. Will we see a rise in microplastics where these are worn or disposed?\n\n[N/R/P][95/99/100] masks/filters are also manufactured using polypropylene fibers.\n\nPolypropylene bottles have been known to shed microplastic particulates, and now we're introducing PP fibers from disposable masks.",

With roughly 50% of the US population fully vaccinated, that means an average US citizen's chance of hospitalization or death from a breakthrough infection is 0.006%.  I wonder what the chances would be for someone at Kettering?",

And my answer to that is:\n\n1. Every person's life is valuable.  I don't want to get through this and say \"well, 99% of Kettering students didn't die, I guess we were successful\".   I don't want to have to add a single name to the Memorial Wall when this is done.  There are too many names there already.\n2. Breakthrough infections are rare, but those with breakthrough infections can turn around and infect others, both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.   Vaccines and masks aren't just about protecting the individual: they're about protecting the people around them, too.\n3. While it's really easy to say \"people who choose not to be vaccinated deserve what they get\", that's not at all true.  I know a vaccinated staff member at Kettering who got COVID (somewhere) and went home and gave it to his child (who can't get vaccinated yet).   I have a dear friend at another school who can't get the vaccine because one of the preservatives in the vaccine will put her into cardiac arrest (it's happened before), and has no choice but to go out into the world and hope the people around her aren't going to infect her.   Anything we can do to reduce the transmission rate is important.",

If I was qualified to answer that question, you're not qualified to evaluate the answer.\n\nSo, fine, let me find you some data.   Google, show me the data ...\n\n\u201cThe data are clear \u2014 the most recent data \u2014 that when a person gets infected who has been vaccinated, namely a breakthrough infection, and they get infected with the delta variant, that the level of virus in their nasopharynx \\[the upper throat behind the nose\\] is about 1,000 times higher than with the alpha variant,\u201d Anthony Fauci, MD, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, explained on MSNBC on July 28. \u201cAnd it has been well documented that even though it\u2019s a rare occurrence, those individuals can and have transmitted the virus to uninfected individuals.\u201d  ([https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/vaccines-work-well-against-delta-variant-here-s-why-you-should-wear-mask-anyway](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/vaccines-work-well-against-delta-variant-here-s-why-you-should-wear-mask-anyway))  \n\n\nEverything else I'm finding basically points to the same arguments: (a) masks reduce transmission by infected individuals; (b) vaccinated individuals who get infected can transmit the virus the others.   It's not hard to put (a) and (b) together.\n\nBut if you want another reason, look at this argument from the health officer from LA County ([https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/vaccines-are-effective-against-covids-delta-variant-so-why-do-we-need-to-wear-masks-indoors/](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/vaccines-are-effective-against-covids-delta-variant-so-why-do-we-need-to-wear-masks-indoors/)).\n\nLA County had the same policies that Kettering used to start the term: vaccinated individuals were not required to wear masks indoors, while unvaccinated individuals were required to do so.   In response, *nobody wore masks at all*, regardless of vaccine status.   And so unvaccinated individuals were getting infected, and getting seriously ill, and infecting lots of other people in the process.   When a universal masking mandate was put into place, everyone wears a mask --- which primarily benefits everyone because the cultural norm is for masking, and unvaccinated people mask up.\n\nI saw this at Kettering this term.   We started this term with roughly 25% of students and 20% of staff unvaccinated, and therefore required to wear masks.    I never saw more than 5% of people on campus wearing masks --- and some of those wearing masks were vaccinated.   So, more or less, unvaccinated people (students and staff alike) were just ignoring the rules, increasing the risk of transmission for everyone.\n\nNow, Kettering's rule is that everyone has to wear a mask.   And guess what?   I'm seeing compliance rates at 95-100% on campus.   Because there's no way to lie about your vaccination status to get out of wearing a mask.\n\nThe face shield argument you bring up is a red herring, because the data already shows that face shields don't bring an order of magnitude benefit.

The question I am asking is, are cloth/surgical masks worth the hassle for only a small reduction in transmission (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0057100)?  \n\nIf you don't like the face shield example, consider instead N95 masks.

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/science-of-masking-full.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/science-of-masking-full.pdf)\n\nI don't agree with mandating N95 masks on campus for the following reasons:\n\n1. Nobody else is requiring N95s in general-purpose settings (i.e. non-medical settings).\n2. N95s aren't any more effective than ordinary cloth masks *when worn improperly*, and it's tricky to wear an N95 properly.   Basically, the N95 should form a tight enough seal on the face to make it difficult to breathe --- and we have already enough bull@#$! about \"I can't breathe in a mask\".\n3. Related to (2): you can't wear an N95 if you have facial hair.  So I'd have to shave my glorious beard :).\n4. N95 masks aren't re-usable.   You can use one for a few days, but then you need to dispose of it and get a new one.   Cloth masks are, of course, washable and re-usable.\n5. N95 masks are really needed by health professionals.  At least early in the pandemic, health professionals couldn't get N95s because ordinary people were hoarding them.   I think that the supply problem has been fixed, but I'm not sure about that.\n6. How do you know when you buy an N95 that it's legitimate?   Alas, people are selling \"fake\" N95 masks now, because lying to people to make money is attractive.\n\nSo, in summary: it's hard to use an N95 properly, and you have to buy lots of them.   The best possible mask that costs a lot of money and few people use properly provides the same *effective* protection as the cheaper, reusable cloth mask.",

It agrees with the studies in your linked PDF in the ideal setting, but then takes it a step further by factoring in things like realistic breathing and leakage around the sides of the mask.  It seemed fairly straightforward to me, about 10% (I would consider that small...) reduction in germ spewing for cloth/surgical masks.\n\nAnd I agree with all of your reasons against mandating N95s.",

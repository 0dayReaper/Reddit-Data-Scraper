The contractor involved notified the person in-charge of the project that this was the wrong method, but was instructed to do it anyway. Now, where does the blame lie? I don't know. The project manager has spent over $1 million to-date covering up the mistake, but it's still not fixed and cold weather is coming! Pipes are going to freeze. I seriously hope this doesn't bankrupt the university.",

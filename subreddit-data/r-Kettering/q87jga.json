    "postText": "Since Kettering is shutting down all of its non-engineering majors, I've really been thinking if I should stay given I major in Biochem. I have currently completed 5 academic terms at Kettering, so if I were to transfer to another college, I could start out as a sophomore or Junior. I am also on my fourth work term, so I could do one more to complete all of the credits there as well as a lot more experience in the field than others. I'm living in Ann Arbor, and currently really invested in the UM community, despite not fully interacting with people, but I heard they have a great research program, and it would probably take an extra year to graduate, but I'm OK with that. I'm planning on going to post-grad, and feel that while Kettering is truly devoted to me succeeding, that I would do better completing my degree elsewhere. Kettering's a really great community for engineers, and I'm glad it's recognizing that, but I'm sort of an oddball, and feel that somewhere else would do better. Just give me your personal opinions, as I want to make a decision by the end of the fall term.",

Nobody in the upper administration seems to care about the CS department and from my experience the Kettering name doesn't hold as much weight for (computer/CS) companies post-grad.

Kettering's CS program is good but the name has no weight in the tech industry -- it's considered on the same level as every other average university. Unless you decide to work for a company that has a strong relationship with Kettering (Auto-Owners, GM, etc., which I highly discourage because they are some of the lowest paying / least interesting jobs in tech) your degree will not distinguish you in the field. \n\nWhat would really help is the university establishing strong relationships with notable tech firms (maybe something FAANG?). But the university seems mostly interested in Detroit auto still in terms of co-op, so I doubt that would ever happen. Would be cool though!",

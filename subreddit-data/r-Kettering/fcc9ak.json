We just hope everyone is enjoying following/participating so far.\n\nAs long as that's the case, we're not going anywhere.\n\nThank you all for being so awesome and being a part of it, whether it's on the Discord/Twitch/Social Media in general.  It's been great so far.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add for those who aren't aware, Rainbow 6:Siege and Rocket League are getting added this Summer/Fall, so keep an eye out for emails related to those tryouts.",

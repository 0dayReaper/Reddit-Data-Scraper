I don't know anyone personally who works there, but I like hearing from other students what their experience was like. \n\nAre they a good place to work, or not highly recommended?",

I was personally invited to a meeting by a rep, waited over an hour to join,  and as soon as I entered the chat the rep ended the conversation... I rejoined the queue but the fair ended before I got there.  \n\nI left my resume just in case, and got a phone call from someone in HR there... she couldn't tell me the specifics of the position for some reason? And said she'd have someone get back with me about specifics... so yeah, it was kinda strange overall, but it sounds like they might want to interview me, so I'm curious if anyone knows anything about them.",

The marketing department has been more or less rebuilt recently last I heard.\n\nIf Kettering really does want to stay around for their next centennial, they will need to play the marketing game better and have newer facilities soon. Can't bandaid the AB or TH forever.\n\nGranted, cost of attendance is pretty high compared to public colleges that offer engineering degrees, which doesn't help when parents are looking at colleges to suggest to their high school kids. My parents were pretty worried until they spoke with alumni and saw my merit scholarship. Still have hefty loans to pay off, though.",

There is no saturation of people in the engineering fields of study. Especially if you are willing to work in the automotive industry. if you're talking about saturation of engineering programs within Kettering it is kind of their niche. It would make sense that engineering is most of what they have to offer. Finally, engineering is one of few careers that can afford life pretty well even with all the inflation. most engineer jobs pay plenty well enough for people to keep coming to this field even if tuition is expensive.",

Ever since COVID they have intentionally stagnated the cost of tuition for one economic reason or another (I was unaware that they decided to stagnate again after the first year of COVID).\n\n\u2022Kettering University uses a 'locked-in tuition' system which guarantees that the price of your tuition stays the same during your entire undergrad (assuming you finish in time). Meaning the price you pay as a freshman will be the same price when you are a senior.\n\n\u2022I'm really glad the university has decided to not raise tuition again for the next set of freshmen coming to Kettering.\n\nAre any of the bullet points that I have listed incorrect? If so, please provide a source that says otherwise. If I'm wrong about locked-in tuition, then it seems I have been grandfathered into the locked-in tuition.",

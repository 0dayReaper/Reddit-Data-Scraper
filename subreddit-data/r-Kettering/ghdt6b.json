No one will stop you. You can borrow a vacuum from your RA if you so desire. They did also recently redo the main lobby (as others have said), and it looks really good. Kettering knows TH is outdated, and they're working to make it more modern.\n\nThe dorms are as cool or plain as you make them. If you want to spruce yours up, I'd recommend some new lighting. I covered my wall in Christmas lights, and it looked really good. I also recommend LED strips. You can always bring in a rug too. You can choose to have your bed lofted if you'd like, and I've seen people put hammocks or futons underneath. Like others have said though, it's not about the carpet. I really enjoyed TH because of the people and the sense of community you feel with your peers, not because it was decorated nice. I do believe the perks of a mini-fridge, microwave, and room to yourself are things to consider as well.\n\nAs far as costs go, I would like to emphasize that dorms are expensive, and there are cheaper alternatives for on-campus housing. I see you have mentioned a desire to become an RA, which would alleviate some of those costs. I'd like to caution you on some of this. Being an RA isn't a guarantee. There are many people that want to become one and go through the steps to do so, but as we're a small school, not many are chosen because we don't need as many. Even if you are chosen, you will still have to pay for the terms you lived there before you were hired, which is a pretty penny that I personally wouldn't spend unless you have to.",

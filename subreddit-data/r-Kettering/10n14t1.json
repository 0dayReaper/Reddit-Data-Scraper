All student workers now make $12 an hour. \n\nKettering Students value their time; we have a limited amount of time to learn in 11 weeks. Learning isn\u2019t optional, functioning technology isn\u2019t optional, but being a student worker is optional for most students. \n\nIf you ran a business and said you were open 8-5 Monday to Friday for your customers and you were never there. Your customers would be frustrated and likely leave a 1-star review and go elsewhere.\n\nNow let\u2019s say your customers pay $22,190 a term or $2017.27 per week to have access to that business. These customers don\u2019t have the option of going elsewhere for service, but they can leave a 1-star review (this Reddit post).\n\nStudents wouldn\u2019t have to be \u201ctrolls\u201d if the LC IT Help desk was open 8-5 Monday through Friday. If a department says they are going to be somewhere from a certain time in their newsletter they better be there.",

They can sometimes get students who are able to help you with your computer and get things fixed, but ultimately they are a school. They didn't sell you that computer and have no legal responsibility to fix it if something is wrong with it.\n\nIf you have a legit hardware issue and take it to the place where you bought it and where you have a warranty that covers the part, they will replace the part and give it back to you. If it's a Windows issue and you are still running the windows install that came on it, they will take care of it. If it's an Apple, then you should have AppleCare and take it to a Genius Bar and they will reset it get you back on your feet. Those are services that you are paying for or paid for.\n\nIt's NICE that Kettering tries to offer this service. but computer sellers have to honor their warranties. That's the difference. For the same reason, I buy my appliances and stuff from a local shop. If my dishwasher, washing machine, or boiler break and it's in warranty then they are right out and get it fixed (and if it's not, I can pay the cost for the repair and the part).",

No, it isn't. Expecting them to be even when they say they will is a mistake. They have absolutely no reason whatsoever to staff that desk, and expecting them to do so is a gargantuan mistake. Are they making money from staffing that desk? No? Then they ain't gonna do it. Welcome to how life works.\n\nWhat I am saying is that people who are not required to help you PROBABLY aren't going to do it even if they say they are going to.

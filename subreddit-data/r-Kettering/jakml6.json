    "postText": "Today I decided to visit the local grocery store north of downtown looking to buy a bag of coffee. I parked my car in the open lot where a homeless man immediately blocked off my car and came over to beg for money. Initially, I wasn\u2019t afraid so I ignored him until he started tapping on my window. Going through every worst case scenario in my head I decided against trying to pull out of the lot in case he was armed for whatever reason. I calmly rolled down my window slightly and gave him all the money I had which was roughly $2 in change. At this point, the man walked to the passenger side door and began yanking the handle muttering something about how I needed to take him to the atm and give him a lot of money. Still being afraid he was armed I said that I had to get coffee from the store and couldn\u2019t take him to the atm. To this he said that he would escort me to the store. Inside the store he began screaming \u201cmy nephew needs coffee...y\u2019all got coffee??\u201d Repeatedly until the owner showed up. Since he was not wearing a mask, he was promptly kicked out. he turned to me and said he would wait for me outside. I asked the store owner if she minded that I camp out inside until the man left. She was fine with that idea but recommended that she could escort me out and tell the man to leave the property. I agreed and got to my car but the man still followed so the store owner told him to leave. To this the man looked at me and laughed saying, \u201cyou should\u2019ve told me, y\u2019all are white suprematists\u201d and then went on his way screaming that we were a bunch of racists. This was definitely the most interesting shopping experience I\u2019ve ever had.",

            "comment": "I'm glad everything worked out okay for you. That can definitely be a scary experience.\n\nIf you haven't spent time in a city before, learn to just say this: \"nope, sorry.\" \n\nIt doesn't matter if they are asking for directions, for the time, for a ride to church because they ran out of gas, or for a high five - the answer is \"nope, sorry\" and you don't respond to anything after that. \n\nThere are people out there who deliberately take advantage of people who are afraid to appear rude/heartless/racist/elitist/etc. It's really shitty. By engaging with them, you make yourself out to be a mark. \n\nMost areas of Flint are quite safe, and I'd hate for students to think otherwise &amp; miss out on this great city, but you should be conscious of how you dress and hold yourself when traveling outside of campus/downtown. Don't make it obvious that you are a student or have money. If you have plain clothes or an old carhartt jacket, that's a good option when going out.\n\nIf you feel guilty and want to help out, there are soup kitchens in the city that can always use donations &amp; volunteers. I hope you will continue to explore Flint - there are a lot of great people &amp; places here. Too many students never leave campus during their time at Kettering.",

They're both decently further away from the campus, but infinitely less sketchy. If you want to completely eliminate sketch and don't mind a short road trip go to the Kroger or Meijer in Swartz Creek.",

I also hope this doesn\u2019t stop you from exploring the city. \n\nAlso, panhandlers don\u2019t need your change. Flint has awesome services for the homeless. Be direct, confident, and assertive. Say you don\u2019t carry cash and you will not get any from an ATM. You will be fine.",

When I was there, I saw a strange kid walking around in the alley behind our rental house, but didn't think anything of it. I left for the evening and came back to a ransacked house, police, and a story from my friends on how they had been held up. \nEvidentially, he took the TV and all the stuff downstairs while they were there and stashed it in a nearby garage and then came back for more. When he went upstairs, he realized they were there and threatened to kill them, and  while brandishing a revolver, he took all the laptops and cell phones he could find. The police detective gave us his card and told us to call to see if they found anything. I called the detective a few times and no one ever even answered the phone. That's Flint for you. \nKeep your eyes open. It's a rough place, but you'll be safe if you don't let your guard down.",

Please see the below link to the official rules, but generally, current students attending Kettering University are tasked with writing a 400-600 word essay about their \u201cfavorite\u201d thing about Kettering. \u201cFavorite,\u201d you say? Well, this is actually a satirical essay contest. We seek to know actually what you think might need some improvement or is, in your opinion, lackluster on or around campus, and introduce a way to make it better for everyone. Entrants will have until 12:00 PM (noon) on 9th Friday, Sep 9, 2022 to turn in their essay to our submission portal (see below). Prizes will be gift cards in the amounts of $200, $100, and $50 for the 1st through 3rd place winners, based on our evaluation of the essays (see rubric via the official rules link). Prizes will also be had for the most creative as well as funny essays, too! The winning essays will also be published on our website!\n\nENTER HERE: [https://forms.gle/VwshCUgsi8z7uHPK6](https://forms.gle/VwshCUgsi8z7uHPK6)\n\nFor official rules, please see our website: [http://newb.kettering.edu/wp/technician/2022/08/17/the-technicians-summer-2022-essay-contest](http://newb.kettering.edu/wp/technician/2022/08/17/the-technicians-summer-2022-essay-contest)",

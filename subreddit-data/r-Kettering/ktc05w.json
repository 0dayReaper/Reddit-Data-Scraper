    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am a current student pursuing there second bachelors in engineering at Kettering. I previously went to U of M and studied biology, but am deciding to change fields as I didn't so much enjoy my previous major. I was wondering if someone could comment on the rigor of courses as well as the difficulty of exams at Kettering University, say, as compared to U of M - Flint? Is the schedule below typical for a student or do you think I should change it a little bit (too difficult)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIME 100\n\nMultivariable Calculus\n\nECE 101\n\nPhysics 244/245\n\nFirst-year course thing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Other than Mike the experiences were mixed from what I heard\n\nFYE - literally a blow-off class. You\u2019ll end up showing up and just talking to other students about yourself\n\nOverall - Your first few semesters of courses are designed to not be too hard so Kettering can get some of your money. It\u2019s by Junior year that you\u2019ll know if it\u2019s for you and who is left standing. I wouldn\u2019t sweat the beginning courses, but, if you\u2019re struggling early on either get help quick or you\u2019ll just end up being behind for the next 4 years.",

Imho calc 2 was the hardest math class I took at Kettering, more than 3, diff EQ, abstract algebra. This was in part because on my teacher, but really I think it just has a ton crammed in.\n\n\nIf you're already used to take college classes, you should be fine. It looks pretty math dense which personally caused some trouble for me (I liked to break up my \"formula\" classes with soc/writing classes), but you know you better.\n\n\nThe good news is that this is a ton of classes you need before others. It'll get a whole bunch of pre reqs outta the way and open you up for more flexibility later on!\n\n\nIf you find that you're having any trouble, definitely make use of the tutors (or whatever they have remotely) and EMAIL YOUR TEACHERS. Even just a small \"hey, I'm having a ton of trouble. Can you point me in a good direction for x topic or getting help with y?\" Kettering is SOOOO much smaller than other colleges, which means teachers are way, way more able to help personally, imho.",

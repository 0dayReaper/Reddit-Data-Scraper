                            "comment": "Why is it necessary to call out their race? Why not their deeper qualifications? Or are they automatically smarter than you because of their minority status? If you can't make the joke without mentioning their race, in this particular context, maybe it isn't a joke that needs to be made.\n\n&gt;I guess I'm no longer able to call it Chinese food or Thai food now.\n\nIf it were an Asian-nationality person showing you how to prepare food that originated in Asia, my opinion might be different. But it's not. The videos you're watching presumably have nothing to do with culture or race.\n\nAlso we're not even talking about food or common vernacular. That's a straw-man argument. We're talking about **people, not objects**. Why does a conversation about minorities automatically direct you to think about food? Are minority cultures nothing more to you than their food? Before you get all up in arms, I'd like you to seriously think about that.\n\nIt's not petty to use this as a teaching opportunity rather than letting casual racism continue to fly under the radar. It's absolutely ok that you didn't notice it at first. Assuming that you're white (since this is KU I have like a 90% of being right, but I apologise if I am wrong) you probably haven't lived the ill effects of stuff like this, but please make the effort to learn why it is wrong. **Racism isn't always blatantly obvious.**\n\nI don't follow any meme subreddits either. This sub is the first place I've seen this joke come up, [a couple days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kettering/comments/hysrqp/all_hail_internet_indians/). I'm assuming that's where you saw it too, considering it's the same exact joke copied and pasted into a different meme template. A joke that has nothing to do with this subreddit other than the subject matter being \"tests\". I'm sorry, but I just can't see the reason that it needed to be posted again, other than that you wanted to make fun of the Indian men in your videos.\n\nLastly, you're reinforcing a harmful stereotype.\n\n[\"Model Minority\" Seems Like a Compliment, but It Does Great Harm](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/10/16/the-effects-of-seeing-asian-americans-as-a-model-minority/model-minority-seems-like-a-compliment-but-it-does-great-harm)\n\n[Too Well-Off to Seek Help?: The Model Minority Myth of Asian Americans](https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/professional/too-well-seek-help-model-minority-myth-asian)\n\n['Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks)",

I came onto this too strong and you got defensive. It's ok. I could've done better, I see that now. I think I should reaffirm for both of us that my argument is against this post and posts like it, not you personally or any of the people that make them. I know your intent wasn't to be racist, and it was wrong for me to imply as much. However, it's small stuff like this that collects into a bigger issue. Look up the term \"microagressions\" if you'd like to learn what I mean.\n\n[Here's an excerpt from NPR:](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/08/872371063/microaggressions-are-a-big-deal-how-to-talk-them-out-and-when-to-walk-away)\n\n&gt;\"Microaggression\u00a0is a term used for brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioural, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative prejudicial slights and insults toward any group, particularly culturally marginalized groups.\" (Wikipedia)  \n\n&gt;\"Oftentimes, people don't even realize that they're doing those sorts of things. And in fact, if you were to stop them and say, 'Why did you just move?' They would deny it because they don't recognize that their behaviors communicate their racial biases.  \n\n&gt;&gt;If someone says something racist to me, what does their intent matter?  \n\n&gt;At the end of the day, if somebody says something racist to you, it's racist. And if it hurt your feelings, it hurt your feelings, so it doesn't really matter what we define it as.  \n\n&gt;But it is important to understand that a lot of times people who engage in microaggressions will not believe that what they said was racist or sexist or homophobic. And so calling them racist or sexist or homophobic would make them very defensive and make them unable to even recognize what their impact was.  [*]\n\n&gt;We're all human beings who are prone to mistakes, and we're all human beings who might commit microaggressions. And it's not necessarily that you're a bad person if you commit a microaggression, but rather that you need to be more aware of your biases and impact on people. We all need to commit to working on these things in order to create a more harmonious society.\"\n\n[*] This scenario might have sounded pretty familiar.\n\nThe rest of that piece is actually a pretty good read if you find a moment. I learned from it, I hope you will too.\n\nLike I said, stuff like this flies under most people's radars. If we can't use these teaching opportunities as they come up, it will continue to slip through the cracks and it will continue to socially disparage minorities. If one person learns from this, learns to recognize and stop that behavior, or at least stops to think about it, then I accomplished my goal.",

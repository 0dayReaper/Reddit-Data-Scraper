I am going into my third school term, and don't really have a support group or friend group going into this term, as that also collapsed due to the stress of Kettering. Any tips? the only club I am dedicated in is Esports, and 90% of my team is B Section",

This isn\u2019t any old university; it\u2019s Kettering, you\u2019re all nerds. See how you get on with a few of the fraternities, and then you can be a nerd with friends. From what little I can tell from your post, I\u2019d recommend the Betas, Delta Chi, Theta Xi, or Sig Chi. No matter where you end up, having a circle of brothers around you is an experience unmatched by anything else KU can offer. Get out into the pool during lunch hour over a few days and just go around chatting with whoever\u2019s out there - assuming that\u2019s somethings that\u2019s resumed since the pandemic.",

At the club expo you can grab their calendars that show when their events are and can also follow them on Instagram and social media to figure it out as well. The best way to judge them is to actually go out there and meet them. They're usually a lot of fun!",

I had the same impulse, but thankfully I had a mentor to push me in the right direction. The IFC may have a more organized fraternity/sorority meet and greet, but in my experience having a tent and a welcoming attitude in the pool was better at finding like-minded people.",

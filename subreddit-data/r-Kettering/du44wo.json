Every sentence has serious issues.\n\n&gt;&gt;Not this term **(yet)**\n\nYou're just trying to mislead the reader into believing that this will be a repeating issue before even presenting the original issue.\n\n&gt;&gt;but Sigs handed out 20 bids to freshmen and invited them all to a party. \n\nIs there any way someone without an invite to this party would know of this, or rather us there a connection that you have to have been privy to this information.\n\n&gt;&gt;Got them drunk\n\nThis in and of itself is not something illegal or immoral unless elaborated further upon, were they force to consume alcohol until they could not   make conscious decisions? Were they over 21 and just sitting down at the bar? Were they under 21 and acting old enough to drink beyond a shadow of a doubt (fake ID someone confirming their age incorrectly)? Were they being served alcohol as minors with the supplier knowing they were underage? These details are very important to why this is bad\n\nYou should also include here the rule in place through IFC that basically amounts to, do not have alcohol at any event where someone that is potentially a new member will be present, this would give a reader more of a scope of the problem beyond absolutely nothing wring that you've said in this comment so far.\n\n&gt;&gt;and individually told them the other freshmen were accepting their bids that night so they would be the only one not to if they didn't. \n\nThis is severe peer pressuring and is a serious issue, however I'm amazed that you have such concrete proof of this when nobody else who was sent to investigate the issue was able to uncover anything while attempting to stop this from happening then and in the future. If you do have a source for this evidence please bring it forward to IFC or Student Life as this is a serious issue that should be handled before any other students need to deal with this.\n\n&gt;&gt;They stopped the party and one-by-one had them stand up on a table and shotgun a beer to accept their bids. \n\nThis is partially contradictory to what you previously stated since they would most likely have an opportunity to figure out they were being manipulated if they talked about their bid acceptance with any of the other non-brothers present or God forbid they hung out with their friends and rushed that house together. Also see the previous issue on seemingly first hand experience.\n\n&gt;&gt;I know multiple people that were there for it. \n\nKnowing multiple people and having them actually come forth in person or you talking them into talking with an authority in the issue is probably more important than saying you know them. I could say I knew Bob Ross personally but it doesn't make my argument any more valid by saying that I knew them. It's misleading, instead say something like 'ive talked to people in attendance at this party and they told me this'\n\n&gt;&gt;Sigs don't see anything wrong with it because \"every house does it\". \n\nNot every house does this and sigma chi knows this I can list off several houses that cannot have alcohol in their premises. And seeing something wrong without citing exactly what is wrong with it can mislead people into looking for something that isn't there. The human mind fills gaps very well, but it's often more bizarre than reality. Giving the full story with prevent untrue rumors spreading that effect everyone involved\n\n&gt;&gt;They haze pledges too, but that's a story for another time.\n\nThis is a common use of misdirection from the issue at hand and concludes nothing about the story. This would count as hazing by ketterings anti-hazing policy issued to every person to return a bid to a fraternity, the hazing story would be the same story as this one.\n\nTLDR; you're misleading users that are reading things on the internet and immediately assuming them to be true, if you have a direct connection or proper sources please provide them to the authorities that are able to handle the issue to prevent it in the future rather than sitting on that information. (If you would like to contact either IFC or Student Life their contact information is available in Kettering connect)",

            "comment": "Pretty sure the story went more along the lines of people expressing concern that sigma chi was giving alcohol to freshmen and it was used as a way to get people out to their house, since a complaint was submitted to IFC or Student Life, IFC took action and did a walk-through of their house, not finding anything to prove that sigma chi was breaking any of those recruitment rules they received a slap on the wrist for that complaint and we're warned to be particularly careful so that there would be no issues in the future since none were found at the present time.\n\nBaseless accusations make for timers that seem far more entertaining than the truth as well fraternities can get into a lot of shit for breaking the universities rules not to mention local laws such as providing alcohol to minors, if they were doing that it wouldn't be difficult for the local authorities to shut them down and for the president of the chapter to face time in prison. As well as charged for all damages caused either to the students involved or and drinking and driving that took place after the alcohol was given.\n\nSource: am not 1 of the 20 guys but was active with IFC at the time this issue took place as a member of a house other than sigma chi, as much as people joke around about the things fraternities do or how their members are I'd say that most fraternity brothers at Kettering are good intentioned semi-mature adults",

Until then it's literally your word against the two people claiming to be 1 of 20 involved saying none of that happened. As such I can't take a definitive stance on this issue.\n\nA larger problem would be that IFC walkthroughs are typically on 24 hour advanced notice due to issues with invasion of privacy, 15 minutes wouldn't allow much of a response time at all as it would probably take longer just to get to sigma chi's house. And typically they're only ever started after a IFC meeting every other Friday, so it could be more like 3-14 days before they have a walk-through. Dunno if there are rules for quicker walkthroughs to check for issues like those though it's been a bit since I read the Constitution and bylaws",

They know it's a rule, they don't care. Just look at the other comments in this thread. One guy wrote an essay about how they are the \"best frat on campus\" and 'it's not like they're doing it to random freshman', as if either of those make it okay to violate state law, Kettering Policy, and the national policy of their own organization.

To be clear, I\u2019m a random GDI and couldn\u2019t give a fuck less about all the Greek drama but watching sig chi get shit on for this is comical at best.\n\nI\u2019ve watched the same kids go over there for 5-6 days a week for 6 weeks (read that as: all of the recruitment period) because their house is sick and massive and their brotherhood is awesome too. \n\nI rushed them as a freshman 1 but didn\u2019t get a bid but all it took me was a couple of piano mans and the feeling at a party and that was enough to make me realize that these guys are close and have a good bond.  \n\nThey don\u2019t invite random kids out, black them out, then \u201cforce\u201d the kids to accept a bid. It\u2019s pretty simple that those freshman (that have been rushing, again, for 6 weeks and are over there daily) want to accept their bids to the best frat on campus with or without a party.  \n\nThose guys hold most of the positions on campus, raised 95% of the total charity money raised last year, (over $20,000) 95% of the total community service hours (like 3k or some shit) and consistently rush the best on campus while getting shit on by a bunch of random hidden reddit idiots in a shitty frat house lmao\n\nI can say all this and not give a damn because I\u2019m not biased at all like 90% of this subreddit.  If you don\u2019t like them, maybe go talk to one of them.  If you\u2019ve never seen them, maybe leave your chopperhouse or grilledcheesecirclejerk and visit campus to see their 60 brothers running the school.\n\nAll in all, fuck the drama and the rumors.  They don\u2019t have 25%-75% of their pledges drop every year (like all the other frats on campus) and consistently wade through the rumors to rush better than all the other sorry frat boys on here.  \n\nAt the end of the day, if you want to hide from the drama, come party with me at CV and black out in my apartment.",

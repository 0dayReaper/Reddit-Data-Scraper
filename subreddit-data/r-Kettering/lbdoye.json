Yeah, you can\u2019t really understand him and therefore his classes are harder than they should be, but he does care about his students and is a genuinely nice guy. Being a professor wasn\u2019t probably supposed to be his calling in life though.",

Rather, breaking down material into manageable chunks, presenting ideas in an organized way, and being able to explain such new ideas in a way someone without extensive knowledge in your subject is what defines a good professor (among other things). Dimitrov has none of these, and probably will never. This email just goes to show how he isn\u2019t able to manage his resources (a computer) and respond appropriately to such a situation. Kettering would be so much better off not having him teach if they just want to keep him there for the research.",

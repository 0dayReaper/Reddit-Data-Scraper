Maybe if they actually read the teacher evaluations and dealt with readily occurring problems I might maybe just maybe not be as spiteful.",

You get the cords but the $20.21 donation amount? Really? Why not just set up donation tiers? The email would be like this:~~\n\n~~\u201cIn recognition of your graduation \u2026 you\u2019re invited to donate to the Keep me Kettering scholarship fund. Donations start at $5, however, if you donate more than $20 you will receive blue philanthropy cords to wear at graduation and you can give a professor a shout-out (optional)\u201d.~~\n\nEdit: ~~\"see what we're doing here?\" Getting our attention to donate at least $20 to this fund? I'm sure some would be willing to donate more, but this email suggests that everyone should just give $20.21.~~\n\nEdit: see replies",

Kettering is hardly the first organization to use this particular gimmick.  \n\nAnd saying \"you can give any amount you want\" is redundant ... because if you wanted to just donate $5, I'm sure the online donation system would handle it just fine.",

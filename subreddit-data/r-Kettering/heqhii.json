Make sure to ask a lot of questions to make sure you're comfortable with going to Kettering. It's pretty much like any other smaller school but the only real difference is the co-op program and fairly helpful staff. Some profs are great, some are terrible, but it's like that at every school. Hell my brother went to Oakland University and had the same biology professor that my mom had and she should've been fired before my mother went to OU.",

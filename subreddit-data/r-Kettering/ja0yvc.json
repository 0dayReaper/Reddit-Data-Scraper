            "comment": "Background: I originally asked to receive all the graduation items in the mail -- subsequently received a confirmation email, but today this popped up in contradiction to my expectations to receive everything including the diploma. I won't be in state for 2021 commencement, but I don't think I'd want to attend a dual ceremony anyway.\n\nIf they take up my offer, I will be arriving on campus with regalia as intended, most likely to the registrar's office. It probably wouldn't make too much of a scene, but personally I think it would make for a quite picturesque close to my academic career here. I'm guessing they'll just mail it though, but I still wanted to accurately convey my feelings about the sudden cancellation.",

That was up until graduation; hence my upset reaction. I should clarify that I did not intend to be accusational in any regard; I merely meant to express disappointment with sarcasm while simultaneously getting ready for the worst, as per my usual expectation for bureaucracies.\n\nI'm glad this has been cleared up, and I hope it has helped others in their attempts at finalizing their often arduous transactions with Kettering. Godspeed ya'll.",

    "postText": "u/anotherKUthrowaway\n[Address Redacted]\n\n\nDecember 8, 2020\n\n\nPresident Robert McMahan\nKettering University\n1700 University Ave\nFlint, MI 48504\n\n\nDear Mr. McMahan,\n\n\nFirst I would like to thank you for your constant updates and diligence in keeping the Kettering community informed about the current\u00a0situation with the COVID-19 pandemic. In these times any and all plans are subject to change at a moment's notice on account of the actions of the governor and the department of health. You and the entire Kettering administration has coped well with these setbacks and changes made. I understand that although not all decisions made have been welcomed, I feel overall you and your team have had our best interests in mind. That is until today.\n\n\nAt 9:10 am on today, December 8, 2020, I and the entire campus community received\u00a0the Bulldog Weekly Student News. Within this edition of the student news,\u00a0it was announced that HonorLock Test Proctoring would be the newest software addition to the Kettering online testing system. I was not aware of this company and their software prior to this morning but was interested in what benefit\u00a0they could provide to students and faculty alike. After some quick research into HonorLock, I have found this company to be distrustful at best. The sheer amount of data collected from the software rivals\u00a0those of Facebook, Amazon, or Google. Within the copious amounts of cookie data being recorded, the company will also be collecting a picture of our photo IDs every time we begin a test.\u00a0\n\n\nThe requirement to possess a webcam and the further requirement to authorize the webcam to record, and store, video and audio recordings of all students is a violation of the\u00a0Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) passed in 1974. If you are unaware\u00a0of the law,\u00a0The FERPA statute is found at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, and the FERPA regulations are found at 34 CFR Part 99.\u00a0 These protections are forced to be waived when students are signing up for the HonorLock software. Not being able to maintain my rights and protections given to me at a federal level in order to receive\u00a0my education is and will be considered by me, and presumably others, a violation of my basic human rights. Additionally, there are students who do not have a webcam. Will you be providing the required equipment and/or funding to those who are now going to be required to own it?\u00a0\n\n\nWhen looking into what data HonorLock will be accessing and storing, I found that any activity done on the student's computer is at risk. This is not purely limited to tasks done with the software active. As someone with company sensitive data being stored on my laptop, I fear HonorLock will be able to access this data and information. This would be a violation of\u00a0ISO/IEC 27002:2005. This would then put my employment at risk as I failed to take the necessary\u00a0precautions\u00a0to protect my companies data to prevent a costly security breach. I have already been in contact with my employer with regard to this potential risk.\u00a0\n\n\nFurther investigation of HonorLock's\u00a0business\u00a0shows it uses data collected for monetary\u00a0gain. Primarily, the software sells the data collected back to the school. These are the recordings given to the teachers. Secondly, as per the company website, data collected can be stored and sold in aggregate. To compare the language used by HonorLock, it is equaled only by companies currently under federal investigation for abuse of power. Furthermore, HonorLock uses the web-based servers of Amazon Web Servies\u00a0(AWS). HonorLock can then allow their\u00a0data collected to be accessed and sold to Amazon without having to disclose to students of their doing so.\u00a0 HonorLocks website claims to only store a limited amount of data but other students from other universities have found this to not be true. HonorLock has failed the \"Wooden Spoon Test\". This is a test where students would google the phrase \"wooden spoon\" or state it out loud at any point during a test and within a few days, wooden spoons were being recommended\u00a0to them through targeted advertisements.\u00a0\n\n\nAt this point, I would like to personally reason you, Dr. McMahan. A few short years ago there was a data breach for seniors where their contact information was sold/given out to a third-party company that then harassed them for weeks on end. That data breach, I hoped, was a one-time event and thus far has not happened\u00a0again. If anything were to happen with the data HonorLock is stealing from students this would be an inexcusable fault of you and the entire administrative team. I ask that you consider this before going forward with the implementation\u00a0of this intrusive software. Having a large database of students, their IP addresses, pictures of their photo IDs, and recordings of their likeness and any possessions\u00a0visible in the recorded window makes students prime targets for theft not just in the digital world. I fear for the strong community of women who will be subject to giving their professors, and anybody else with access to the recordings, video of themselves in their\u00a0homes. Those with access to the videos will be able to secretly view these videos and enables the ability\u00a0for sexual predators to abuse their power for their own sexual gain. Dr. McMahan, I implore\u00a0you to not let this abuse happen. It would be easiest and in your best interest for you to terminate the professional relationship Kettering University has with HonorLock in an effort to protect the students before any (or further depending on the data already provided) damage can be done.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA concerned student,\n\n\n\n\nu/anotherKUthrowaway\n\n\n\n\nP.S. To those reading this, there is a Change.org petition* you are welcome to sign if you feel the need to also let your own voice be heard.\u00a0http://chng.it/V2c7fJSHFz\n\n\n*u/anotherKUthowaway\u00a0is in no way the owner or affiliated\u00a0with the Change.org petition with the exception being I have added my \"signature\" in a show of support.",

Any good professor would just make the test take home with bo rules on how to do it except for possibly no working with others. To be honest the use of the internet as engineering tool is much more realistic to how people actually work.",

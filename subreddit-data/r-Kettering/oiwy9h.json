You will leave that place a well educated young individual with exceptional engineering skills ( and social skills if your lucky or go Greek)\n\nI don\u2019t think the place will be around much longer than 20-25 years",

As for that last part you mentioned, I was thinking the same just earlier this week. It's a shame that the school doesn't advertise and get more kids enrolled. The price tag is jarring and probably scares away many potential students.",

Majors with co-ops where experience in the field is rarer in college / kettering is really known for the program (like ME, EE, IE, CE) I really so believe that the programs are worth it. But after talking with CS, business, and CE majors who have attended other schools like Michigan and Toledo, whey were able to find internships or co-cops (sometimes at the same company I co-op\u2019ed for) while paying for what was an equal education.",

Though I'm grateful for the co-op experience and those few profs who make the Kettering education worth it--there's much room for improvement. The admins could learn a lot if they genuinely listened.",

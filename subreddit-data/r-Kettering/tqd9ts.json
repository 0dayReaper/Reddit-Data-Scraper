Otherwise they are just questions about the leadership style taught in the class. Wether or not this class is actually necessary is a completely different discussion, especially coming from someone who had Rau.",

I had Calahan last fall and it was all essay questions, which really fit the format of the class a lot better, since in Senior Sem there really are no \"right\" and \"wrong\" answers. There are a lot of perspectives that you can correctly or incorrectly interpret, but the conclusion is ultimately up to you to come to and support with evidence.",

He's objectively declaring a number to his subjective stance on a topic. My grade in this class isn't entirely based on how much I know about the class topics but how much I happen to agree with him.\n\n He's done worse before as well. He lowered my attendance grade last term to drop me from an A to a B when I had never once missed a single class nor was I ever late. He just felt like I wasn't an 'A' student even though the sum of my grades from all my papers and tests said otherwise.",

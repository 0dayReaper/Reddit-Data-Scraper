    "postText": "I\u2019m a senior 1 studying abroad next term and after looking through degree works I found out I can study abroad again for my senior 2 term. But then I would have to take all 20 credits for the alternate energy concentration my last term. \n\nAre the classes easy enough to take all at once or will I be overwhelmed?\n\n\u2026.or I can simply not do a concentration and have a relaxing last term. I\u2019m unsure how important having a concentration would be once I\u2019m looking for a job.\n\nAm I making a mistake trying to force 2 study abroad terms in a row? This feels like a rare opportunity to spend so much time abroad. But I don\u2019t want it to come at a cost of expanding my resume and education with a valuable AE concentration unless it turns out to be worthless extra classes.\n\nAny and all advice is greatly appreciated, thank you!",

I got that concentration and never explicitly used it to land a job so its weight on a resume is likely mostly dependent on the industry you're trying to enter. I will say I remember some of the courses being fun and interesting. I don't remember them being awfully hard. Study abroad may have interesting opportunities to build your resume too I would imagine, your resume doesn't have to be all course work and co-op. \n\nThat said,  I interview a ton of new grads and the best candidates can demonstrate that they are professionally contributing and understand personal responsibility in their work or school experiences.  Typically having an internship/co-op already sets you above the curve, assuming you're getting decent projects and experiences that can go on a resume and that you can talk about your contributions and learnings in an interview.",

            "comment": "Here is an important point in terms of concentration for any undergrad degree: it won't matter, and limiting yourself to jobs in one specialized subfield is probably a mistake.\n\nYou are much better off going as broad as you can. I come from a family of engineers and have several close relatives who all went to engineering school, and of them exactly one landed a job where they are in the specific specialty they studied. That person has a PhD.\n\nYou are better off looking at the industry, looking at companies that will be good to work for in the long term, and tailoring your classes to that end. Do you WANT to work designing EV's? Well, the specialty is worth it then, but it's possible that the manufacturers are more interested in EE and CE degrees, and that sort of specialty is only really useful if you are working on powertrains. There are more jobs available at suppliers, making seatbelts, airbags, seats, headlights, steering columns... and that's where you are more likely to end up. It's certainly less exciting, but it's also more likely.",

    "postText": "Good Afternoon redditoids,\n\nMy name is u/CreamyHead69, and I am the newest mod of this subreddit. I\u2019m so glad to have this honor bestowed upon me, I know I deserve it. This sub desperately needs more moderation, it\u2019s overrun by commies and brigadiers. From now on, anyone who downvotes me or talks back to me will be IP banned. Any communist behavior, like cancel culture or being a soyboy, will also result in a ban. I am so glad that I can finally clean up this sub and turn it into the glorious utopia it once was. \n\nIt appears the current mod team could not give me the right permissions, but we\u2019re currently in discussion to fix that issue so I can begin moderating this sub correctly. Until then, anyone who downvotes me or acts like a commie will have their name written down so I can ban you later.\n\nThat is all\n\nEdit: To the people giving me rewards. I know I deserve them, however that money can be much better spent. Please donate to the NRA or Steven Crowder instead.",

I'm sure the sub appreciates a mod who'll ban those who make decisions that they personally disagree with \ud83d\ude0a\n\nu/Shadow503, please message me soon so we can work on it \ud83d\ude18",

If I were to take out that content, we would be down to just a few posts a week. Back when shitposting was at an all time high, I made a post asking if \"everyone was still having fun\" and if we should moderate more heavily. The vast majority of the community responded wanting the moderation to remain light. I have tried to respect those wishes.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the memes help keep engagement up with the sub. This means more people see posts from /r/kettering on their front page and in their inbox. Even the serious posts on this sub benefit from that visibility.\n\nIf you're serious about change here, I challenge you to be the change you wish to see. Upvote the serious posts/questions/announcements and downvote the trolls. Find ways to use the subreddit to help you, your clubs, or your fellow students. Message the mod team if you have something that you think should be stickied for visibility. There are a number of faculty, students, and clubs that make use of this sub; a good first step is to do what you can to amplify that content.",

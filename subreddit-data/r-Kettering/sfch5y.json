But even though it is said that the protection provided by the original two-dose series wanes over time, it is also said that this level of vaccination still provides defense against severe disease. The booster just restores what has waned. \n\nThe virus is infecting many, many people, and thus there are more opportunities for mutations, which make the virus different and less recognizable in comparison to the original virus that the body was trained against during vaccination.\n\nBut again, data says that there is a correlation between vaccination status and severity/survivability. If you think it's not a vaccine, you are denying science. Or maybe you think that literally everybody is in on this. Personally, I don't believe that every single world government and every single medical research organization that has ever conducted a study about COVID vaccines with a positive outcome is collaborating to screw us over. I think that's delusion.",

If you get the virus, especially when it's a new strain, it can train your immune system against that strain better than a vaccine that was developed for the original strain. The idea is that we don't want everybody to get it, because we don't want everybody to roll the dice on having long-lasting complications or dying from it... you know, especially for the compromised people that you are talking about. If the solution we wanted was, \"everybody just get it and then nobody will get it,\" we wouldn't have done anything about COVID in the first place.\n\nNot all of the at-risk people are responsible for their own risk. Obesity, unless you have something like an underactive thyroid, is generally a result of poor choices. But even that can't necessarily be reversed in a matter of months with an honest effort. You can't decide to stop having genetic immune disorders. You can't decide to stop having cancer and having to undergo immunocompromising chemotherapy.\n\nThese people should get vaccines. Do you really think that eating an orange, taking Zinc, and exercising for 30 minutes a day for a couple weeks really lowers someone's risk profile as much as a vaccine that trains your immune system to fight the virus?",

It most certainly can be reversed in a matter of months (4lbs a month or 0.5-1.0% of your bodyweight) can do wonders for your health. That could be someone going from 300lbs to 248lbs in a year. To your question about exercise and zinc, yeah it can lower the risk. If you didnt know yet you will now that proper vitamin D and Zinc intake are the core factors that can influence your immune system aside from genetic abnormalities. I think you'd be amazed how much better your health would be if you tried to do the following:\n \n\u25cfget proper quantity and quality of sleep\n \u25cfdrink half your weight (lbs) in ounces of water\n\u25cfhave proper vitamin intake\n\u25cftry or succeed at getting 10,000 steps a day\n\u25cfget some low to moderate amounts of modest weight training. \n\nAnd if you still feel at risk of death, then go to the next step that you think is right. Your health is your responsibility, not mine. I have done what I think will protect me from severe illness as does everyone who has and has not taken this shot. \n\nNot to mention, the Nobel Prize winning drug, Ivermectin, straight up could have been our way out of this a year ago.",

Not taking the vaccine, not wearing your mask, not taking easy precautions to prevent the spread of COVID is selfish, period. \n\nThe majority of the people hospitalized currently for COVID are those who are not vaccinated. You are contributing to the problem by just choosing to not be vaccinated, and that is selfish. \n\nI don't care about your individual single experience between you and your couple of friends.

How does that make any sense?

Remember that the only results you can get out of such an experiment is \"rejecting the hypothesis\" or \"failing to reject the hypothesis,\" never \"confirming the hypothesis.\"\n\nLuckily for us, we've had countless observational studies run by scientists all over the world. Almost all of those studies reject the hypothesis that the hospitalization and infection rates between the vaccinated and unvaccinated are about the same, instead concluding that that there is a strong correlation between the vaccine and a reduction in hospitalization and infection rate. Just because you personally failed to reject your hypothesis that you don't need to take the vaccine doesn't mean your hypothesis is correct, especially given your sample size of like 3 people compared to most other studies' sample sizes in the thousands.",

However, how are you supposed to know that getting a vaccine \"doesn't really work for \\[you\\]\" if you haven't gotten it? You're also completely ignoring the fact that being vaccinated reduces your risk of spreading COVID to others, as shown in multiple studies. There is no good reason not to get the vaccine other than taking up 30 minutes of your time. Worst-case scenario, it has a very minimal effect on symptoms and transmission. Which is still better than nothing at all, especially given the fact that the average case is a rather significant decrease in infection rate, transmission rate, and severity of symptoms.",

I don\u2019t expect it from anyone else and I think someone wanting me to get a vaccine to protect them from getting it from me, is incredibly selfish of them.

The vaccine doesn't stop you from getting COVID, doesn't stop you from spreading COVID, and now doesn't even guarantee that you will be able to return to normal life, as previously advertised.\n\nAnd in the same paragraph you admitted that you have two completely oppositional beliefs, that the vaccines aren't 100% effective, and they are safe and effective.\n\nYou should listen to the Joe Rogan podcast with Dr. Robert Malone, who is one of the core contributors to the creation of the MRNA vaccine technology, who has serious apprehensions about the vaccine.\n\nOtherwise you should probably stop s*** posting ignorant ideas on the Kettering subreddit trying to demonize people who have read more than you.",

Well, I\u2019m not currently seeking a way to be safe from covid because I feel that I already am. I\u2019ve probably had covid countless times and not once was it more then a cold. Ive also got tested probably 20 times and not once have I tested positive.\n\nThe more people are told what to do the more people are going to be put down until they have had enough.

Yes, overall numbers aren't down, but that doesn't mean that those numbers couldn't have been exponentially worse without the vaccines.  \n\nThat's the hardest part of this from a scientific perspective.   We can't run independent experiments with a control group and a test group over the next five years to get absolute certainty about vaccine effectiveness.   We have to make this decision on the fly and run with it --- monitoring it carefully, of course.  \n\nBut there are plenty of statistics available right now that compare infection rates, hospitalization rates, and death rates with and without the vaccine.   Of course, I don't know what standard of proof you'd be willing to accept.",

Not only does virtually all published research show that hospitalizations and infections are significantly reduced among the vaccinated population, but I can say from personal experience that the vaccine at least helps make the entire experience much less miserable.\n\n1. Everyone else in my family is unvaccinated, and all of them caught COVID from each other. Despite living in the same household as them, I never caught it; my test came back negative twice. It's not like I wasn't around them either, my brother and I share a bedroom. In fact, I was around my brother for far longer than he was around my sister (who was patient zero in my household).\n\n2. When I finally caught COVID after coming back to campus, the only symptom I had was a runny nose (not even loss of taste/smell). I didn't even know I had COVID (I thought my allergies were just flaring up) until my friend, who is also vaccinated and has asthma, caught it from me, showed symptoms on par with a cold (runny nose and a cough), and got tested. Compare that to my siblings, who had sore throats, runny noses, bad coughs, and general aches.\n\nI don't know about you, but I'd much rather take a mild runny nose or no COVID at all than the full COVID-19 Experience\u2122. I'd also like to prevent others from getting the full COVID-19 Experience\u2122 given that it takes literally 30 minutes of my time across two days to do so.",

So if the same person gets tested everyday for 10 days at the hospital, that\u2019s 10 covid positive tests. If that person is unvaccinated, now there are 10 more positive covid deaths. You are way too caught up in the numbers. Once again, you are trying to explain everything with data and numbers that don\u2019t prove or disprove anything in their current state.",

Vaccined and boostered, for context.\n\nSome of us *can't* go out all willy-nilly to parties and other dumb shit because even with the vaccine, catching COVID would mean hospital and potentially ICU. Some of us *have* to go out for whatever reason - doctor's visits aren't always telehealth compatible, especially dealing with infusions or similar treatment. We have no choice. Even variant Omicron, which supposedly has less of an impact (aside from being extremely highly contagious), it very well can and will land an immunocompromised person at the hospital. At least it reduces the chances of death...won't reduce the chance of costly medical bills.\n\nFor a normal health person? Sure, the vaccine means staying home feeling like shit instead of a hospital stay. For someone who's immunocompromised? It's the difference between hospital/ICU and death. No vaccine *ever* has a 100% chance of avoiding a virus, but they *do* offer increased protection and lesser severity of a virus.\n\nI'm all for looking out for your health (some of us absolutely *have* to), but your right to freedom and liberty does not take precedence over someone's right to live. Please, think about this the next time you encounter a cashier at Meijer during Super Bowl weekend or the fast food worker working at 2AM during a drunken Taco Bell run.",

With incubation period this is especially dangerous as you can be spreading it without people knowing. \n\nYou're more likely to get it without a vaccine, and though I might have mine, I still can get it and spread it if I catch it from someone else.

Just wear your seat belt if you're so scared, why does it matter if I drink and drive if you have your seat belt on?\" \n\nGood laugh this morning though, thanks",

There is no need to forcibly educate the public or tell people that they are a bad person for not getting a vaccine. I don\u2019t agree that vaccines are effective enough to warrant me getting it. But at the same time I\u2019m not saying you are wrong for getting it, that was your choice, do as you please, we live in a country where your right to make that decision is protected.",

Are they keeping Kettering Open??? because my son really wants to attend this school but not if the Coronavirus is already in the school. Officials are not even doing anything to contain it yet??? Did you know that Harvard already shut down! Harvard!!!! And even Ohio State, but Kettering does not care for the safety of their own students. I trust Whitmer, and Michigan is in a state of emergency and all of my son's friends at Kettering are terrified that they're going to catch the disease and apparently stores are no longer selling hand sanitizer and toilet paper and water! So Kettering has poison Flint water and the Coronavirus????? \n\nWhy in heavens name would I let my Son go to such an unsafe school and campus that does not care for their students and common precautions!!!!",

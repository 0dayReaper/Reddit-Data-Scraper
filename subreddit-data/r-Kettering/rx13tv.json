Thanks for taking food out of my mouth.  Do you think your academic experience is best measured by the number of hours you spend in class in front of a professor?  Do you demand a refund when the school closes for bad weather?   Or when the professor cancels class because he's sick?",

Where do you think the money for your pro-rated tuition would come from?   Kettering isn't sitting on a dragon hoard of gold somewhere.   The money raised for the Learning Commons can only be spent on that; otherwise, it'd be a bait-and-switch.   The only way to get you pro-rated tuition is to make massive budget cuts --- and that level of budget cut can only be realized  by staffing reductions or salary reductions.   \n\nSo, who do you want to fire?  Note that this isn't about firing one or two faculty that you don't like.   You'd need massive firings to get the cost savings you need --- and then you'd have additional problems like stupidly-large class sizes as the remaining faculty try to put a term together.\n\nYes, it's a shitty situation, and it's none of our fault.  I get that your OP may have mostly been reacting out of frustration.  My response was in kind.  \n\nI'm doing my very best to delivery a quality educational experience in the middle of this shitshow pandemic.  I don't need people telling me it's not good.   I \\*know\\* it's not good.   But we're all rebuilding the airplane while it's in mid-air.   I'm doing the best that I can.",

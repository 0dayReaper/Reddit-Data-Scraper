            "comment": "Channel your Ioannatos and think about the cost of providing classes. \n\nThe fixed costs (blackboard, IT, buildings, tables and chairs) have already been spent, so there\u2019s no saving money on that. I know what you\u2019re thinking though, \u201cI\u2019m not using those buildings tables and chairs, so why should I have to pay for them?\u201d The answer is that if Kettering immediately liquidated all those assets and passed that savings onto you, there would be no campus to come back to and the university would not be viable in the long term. Your degree would be worthless. So long story short, that shit still has to be paid for with online class tuition.\n\nThe variable costs (teachers salaries, electricity, gas, water, student program budgets) is where the cost savings should come in. However, we know professors aren\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t be, paid less for online classes. Therefore the savings should come from not paying for as much electricity and water, and not buying as much pizza for KSG clubs. \n\nFrom looking at [UofM Flint\u2019s publicly available 2019 income statement](https://www.umflint.edu/sites/default/files/groups/Financial_Services___Budget/financial_reports/umf_fy15_to_fy19_income_statement.pdf) we can see that \u201cGeneral Expenses\u201d (utilities, pizza, and misc other) account for only 8% of their expenses. If we use that to approximate what Kettering spends on their General Expenses, and assume that online classes magically cut that expense in half (and no other costs were added) then we should expect a 4% discount right?\n\nIf the average student pays $35000 per year out of pocket on tuition after university scholarships, then after the online cost savings are passed on to the student, the average out of pocket cost drops to $33400 a year. It basically makes no difference...",

When they still have to pay $33400, my guess would be probably not. Is $800 per semester going to be what prevents a student who was financially impacted from dropping out? Again, my guess is probably not.\n\nWould it make sense to group all the student\u2019s \u201cwould be discounts\u201d into a relief fund so that larger and more effective payouts can be made to those in need on a case by case basis? Yes.",

We subscribe to Blackboard (I think?), so that's an ongoing cost --- and one that's probably larger right now since we're driving way more traffic to Blackboard than before.  Also, IT staff salaries, like faculty salaries, are ongoing expenses, and we definitely need their help in keeping the infrastructure up and running.  \n\n\n(Like helping dumb faculty members who poured a mug of hot tea over their university-provided laptop and bricked the whole thing.   Sigh.)",

That\u2019s why they\u2019re building it now instead of starting in 2017, like the original plan called for.  That money can never be reallocated.\n\nI got a response on my request for the emergency aid within 12 hours.  The amount was pitiful, basically amounting to the ~$800 \u201cdiscount\u201d that was calculated in another comment.\n\nOther communications have been, as you said, nonexistent.  The University needs to come up with several alternative payment plans other than \u201cpay us up front or you can\u2019t register for next term\u201d, especially given that the co-op employment (also known as the majority or sole income of most of the student body) isn\u2019t happening this term for at least half of all the students on work term.\n\nYou\u2019re right to complain, don\u2019t get me wrong.  Just don\u2019t use the example of a new building you know absolutely nothing about in that complaint; that spreads misinformation, which helps no one.",

If I were to make the decision again, Kettering would still make the most sense. \n\nI agree that the university should discuss this topic a bit more, but also understand the troubles of the university. People are being helped by the university in a time of crisis and student loans that are currently not accruing interest leads me to believe that the university shouldn't reduce tuition because of the things that have occurred. If  they have a bunch of surplus money disperse some of it, but I wouldn't want them to discontinue investing into the universities future when they are already doing what they can for those who request help. \n\nStudents are being helped and Kettering is still the best University in Michigan to attend and essentially have a full time position waiting for you after graduation. Other university students don't have the luxury of hoping their previous employer will hire them back when companies begin to open again.",

    "postText": "So I got a year lease on a house about a half a mile from campus. Safe neighborhood, basement, 300mb internet, backyard, 2 car garage as well. Rent and utilities comes to about $500/month.\n\nIdeally, the plan is to rent this place out for another 4 years and switch between A and B section roommates (I'll be living here full time)\n\nI know it's pretty early to be asking you guys in A section about housing, but I'm really not trying to scramble to figure out who's going to be living here. I got 3 bedrooms open as of now.\n\nDM if interested / for pics",

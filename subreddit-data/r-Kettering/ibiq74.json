I wonder if others are having the same issue in that class. \n\nOr CV gets a lot of traffic during your class and somehow your internet becomes less stable. Just a guess though. I lived in CV for B-Section last term and didn\u2019t have any issues like that (I was getting 20 Mbps down on a WiFi connection via personal router). \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that your prof doesn\u2019t record.",

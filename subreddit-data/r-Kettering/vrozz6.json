It should be back up and running in the afternoon tomorrow.\n \nYou should simply log into my.kettering.edu and then find blackboard under tools and applications.  It will be your same login.\n \nCurrently, that's not available to anyone except IT because of the software upgrade currently in progress.\n \nI hope this helps,\u201d \n\nSo hopefully that can be worked out I have not heard anything out and I\u2019ve checked every few days to see",

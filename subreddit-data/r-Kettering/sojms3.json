Didn't realize you needed me to spell it out for you. Do you even remember what was in them? Some headass was probably saying they were put up for the same reasons you're now assuming they took them down.\n\nIt's much more likely imo that some contractor somewhere took them down and forgot to put them back up, or forgot where they put them, or broke them, or threw them out, or admin got distracted with some project elsewhere on campus, or they're planning on putting them up somewhere else, etc., etc., etc. The contractors this school hires have proven to be incompetent on more than one occasion in recent memory. Not everything is a big conspiracy.\n\nBut you've already decided they're guilty with absolutely zero justification, I'm not going to sit here and try to prove them innocent. It's an impossible task. Stay mad. That's clearly what you want.\n\nEveryone is out to destroy white culture and to get you because you're white and the world is a zero-sum game of oppressor-vs-oppressed, and they're not just saying that because stoking the reactionary side of a culture war is a useful tool to polarize and distract us from overarching class struggles. Everything bad that ever happens is the direct result of identity politics, and anything good that happens is actually bad because everything was perfect and in it's natural order as it was. Change is bad. There you go, is that the response you were hoping for? \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44",

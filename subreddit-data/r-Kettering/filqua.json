    "postText": "Hello All,\n\nIf you would like to contribute your computing power to help further disease research and COVID-19 research, consider downloading [Folding@Home](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/dln0o3/foldinghome_and_pcmr_team_up_use_your_pc_to_help/). Don't worry about computing horse power the program was designed to run on a lot of older hardware. I have created a Kettering team, the team ID is  237937.\n\n**What is it?**\n\nFolding@Home is a project by Stanford University that uses our computing power to help study the process of protein folding so as to aid research on various diseases, including many forms of **cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, COVID-19, and Parkinson's**. It is basically a big distributed supercomputer, and you can contribute a node!",

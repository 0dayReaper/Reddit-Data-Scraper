The amount of knowledge this man puts out is unbelievable. In my 6 years at Kettering I have never met a more knowledgeable and caring professor as Kaiser. NAH this dude sucks lmao",

I did not learn anything while in that class since all he does is mumble into his mic while doodling on the board. When I say doodling I don't mean poorly drawing graphs, I mean his equations an words look like the crazy poorly written hieroglyphs of some ancient society. I am astonished that he is still teaching at all.",

He brushes over an equation once and then spends the entire class going over 20 different examples on how its used. It's difficult but if write quickly, go over the notes afterwards, and Google the equations you're using for explanation, you'll probably be fine.\n\nDimitrov on the other hand shouldn't be a professor. I was in his prob stats, never payed attention after the first lecture, and still got an A. He would spend entire lectures doodling in paint while mumbling into his mic. Literally if he had just sent out a PowerPoint of equations and an assignment sheet the class would've been the same experience.\n\nBasically both are horrible but Dimitrov annoys me more.",

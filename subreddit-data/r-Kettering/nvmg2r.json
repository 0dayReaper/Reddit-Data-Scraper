O'Toole is arguably one of the best professors at Kettering, to the pint where I actually really enjoyed his diff eq course, so you lucked out there.",

I personally loved Cheng, thought she was a great lecturer, and had an A in the class, but I am not representative of most people so I focused more on what my students that came to me experienced.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nO'Toole I've had for other classes and had him for Dif Eq as an SI. Great guy, great teacher. Probably the best Dif Eq option and not many students came for help unless it was a test review day. Of course keep good note taking, homework, and studying habits, then you'll be perfectly fine.\n\nI could break down the rest of the professors but you don't need that lol. \n\nYou also spend time just learning how to solve different types of differential equations. First order, higher order, and then solving them using what we call laplace transforms. There are also typically applied problems in there, such as circuits and mass-spring systems. You'll mostly utilize integration techniques from your previous calc courses but other stuff does pop up. So I'd recommend you review:  \n\n\n\\- Integration by Parts, Partial Fraction Decomposition, u-substitution  \n\\- Basic natural log and exponent properties  \n\\- Basic trig stuff  \n\\- Basic derivative techniques like chain rule, product rule, etc.  \n\n\nHope that helps! :)",

He should have office hours and SI always helps if you feel like your struggling. As for what you will learn it doesn\u2019t make sense to worry too much about it now but you will go over linear, homogeneous, symmetric, 2nd order ODEs and solve them using methods such as Bernoulli\u2019s equation, reduction of order, make a non-exact equation exact etc... with Laplace you have to memorize a bunch of properties and unit step functions which can be rough. It sounds like a lot but O\u2019Toole has a really nice pace and will help you if you\u2019re running into issues\n\nEDIT: if you are looking for a place to get started khan academy is always good, I really like professor Leonard on YouTube. Symmetric differential equations and initial value problems are the topics you should probably start with. Feel free to dm me if you still need help, I tutor for b-section.",

Based on the last few weeks of the last a-section term, it is amazing how professors wouldn't email back for days to answer questions, and be terrible with communication in general. Two of my professors just said \"we covered all the material already\" by the time we went completely online, I'm assuming so they didn't have to upload notes or record a lecture.",

Off the top of my head, he spent 300K on solar trees that do nothing, and had lights installed under them so they can be seen at night. That's the quality of decision making you'll see from him at times.\n\nIf you do end up attending, my personal advice is to move out of the dorms as soon as you can because housing even across the street is half the price and twice as good as what you'll find in Thomson Hall.",

            "comment": "If the school continues down the course to a more liberal arts college that the adminstration has chosen there will be nothing of value Kettering can provide. There are plenty of schools that offer an engineering degree, Kettering's reputation is built on academic rigor that is strengthened by a co-op experience. Talking with older alumni, 40 years ago Kettering was a much more academically intensive school, now it seems co-op supplements the holes (ex. very limited exposure to EE topics in an ME course of study despite a world in which there are very few purely mechanical machines) in the academic program rather than strengthing it. Once a school starts to loose it's reputation it's difficult to regain, and I'm worried KU is dangerously close to that point.",

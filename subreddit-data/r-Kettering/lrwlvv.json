Before people that aren't in his class start to roast this prof, his next statement is:\n\n\"Unfortunately there is not much I can do about 'learning' since that is on you. However, if there is something that can be changed in the 'teaching,' please let me know.\"\n\nNow I don't love his teaching methods, don't get me wrong. More specifically, I think his testing procedure is less than ideal. But I think the guy tries to put out a good lecture. He might not be the best prof I've ever had, but I think his \"teaching\" is pretty sufficient. He's open to questions, and he seems like he wants to help his students. The first exam we had, I didn't do so hot, but I knew that the issue was me, not him. I tried to do better on exam 2, and I did. I'd like to see some testing improvement, but I think he poses a fair point in many cases (like myself).",

The exam will be given on Friday to all students that are scheduled to attend the \u201cin-class\u201d session on Friday. These students are expected to attend class and take the examination on Friday, July 31. Similarly, students scheduled to attend the \u201cin-class\u201d session on Monday are expected to attend class and take the examination on Monday, August 3rd.  \n\nContingencies\n\n(1) If you feel sick; fever, sore throat, cold, do not attend the Exam. I will be giving a make-up exam. Please note that make-up exams are modestly harder than the original exam \u2013 you have had more time to study. This is the same approach I would use during a normal term.\n\n(2) If you are required to self-quarantine, I will give you a make-up exam after said quarantine is completed. A doctor\u2019s/ health-care provider\u2019s memo ***may*** be required.\n\n(3) If you have underlying conditions which may render you susceptible to sever health problems, or if you are caring for such a person, I will provide an isolated setting in which you can take the examination.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or concerns. \n\nProfessor Salacuse",

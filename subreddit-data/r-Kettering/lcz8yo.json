(Oh, and did I mention that there's network traffic here that is covered under NDAs and could result in a lawsuit if the data is intercepted?)\n\nAnd before anyone asks \"wHy NOt JuST taKe ThE EXaM In pErsON?\" I am exercising my right to maintaining my health because I refuse to be put at risk over an exam.\n\nQuestion to my peers: Why are we letting Kettering strip us of our right to privacy? Why must we have spyware installed? Why did Kettering not ask any students about their opinions on online proctoring software? \n\nQuestion to professors: Why the lack of trust in students? Why use the most overbearing service available? Why do you want to invade the privacy of students? How deep will you go with reviewing flagged content? Do you have any concerns of any potential legal ramifications in which Kettering may face should certain content be recorded?\n\nTL;DR: Fuck HonorLock and those who choose to force students into being surveilled to an extreme extent.\n\nEDIT - NSFW recordings of students saved to the accounts of professors would be one hell of a scandal and a total PR blunder\n\nEDIT - Survey\n\nHere is a [link](https://forms.gle/er4P9dfSYtccZsVd6) to a Google Form survey. You will be asked to sign into a Google account so only one response can be submitted, however your email will not be saved when you submit to ensure anonymity.\n\nHere is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQlUWf4lxeHLFNPmPH9n1w4GMa3Q6Yg3f-gy1nch4j-Gj36ULUOyFlWpJG54IaIYLxxq6nQnGmMTGzz/pubhtml) to the survey responses.\n\n\nEDIT - What's your experience? Thread\n\nI created [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kettering/comments/ldgeo2/what_was_your_honorlock_experience_like/) where you can share your experience with HonorLock.",

They might be able to detect the virtual environment, and if they are, you could do as someone else suggested and use a different computer (or just pop in a second HDD,do a clean Windows install with nothing on it, and use that then swap the drives back).\n\nI'd still segregate the computer from the rest of the network and do the test in an empty  room somewhere. If you do it right, your router will prevent your computer from seeing anything else locally.\n\nThen, when you are done, toss your other HDD back in and you are all good. HonorLock lives on that other drive and isn't a problem, and you can use it for tests whenever you need to.",

It violates our reasonable expectation of privacy in our own homes and raises the testing stakes particularly for neurodivergent students. I shouldn't have to waive that right in order to earn a degree.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that girls like me who don\u2019t cheat should also have to put up with losers who are just scraping by because some upperclassmen gave them a crib. So far, I\u2019ve talked two of my professors into using honorlock, because there were a few lazy bums in my classes that I know would cheat. Gotta keep it fair for everyone\n\nHonorlock is a completely safe software, there\u2019s nothing to be worried about.\n\nEdit: if you\u2019re downvoting me you\u2019re a cheater and I will report you to the dean of students",

If they didn't learn anything, it either means the prof sucks or they didn't bother to pay attention. If they didn't pay attention in class, it either means the class was unimportant or they're a bad student. If they're a bad student, they're gonna have a real tough time finishing their degree and finding/keeping employment after they graduate. \n\nIn the undergrad engineering world, all school really is; it's partly a turing test that verifies whether you're able to keep up with deadlines and deliver acceptable work; and partly meant to provide you with a baseline set of knowledge to draw from later on. If you don't pick up that baseline set of knowledge you're pretty much screwed, any employer will quickly realize that you have no idea what you're doing. If you can't keep up with deadlines and deliver acceptable work, you're gonna flunk out before you make it to an employer anyways.\n\nIf someone you've labeled as a 'cheater' manages to cheat and make it through life anyways? Honestly, more fucking power to them. They've probably had to fight harder outside of class to make up for that knowledge gap, especially when they get to upper level courses that are harder/impossible to cheat on if you don't make an effort learn the theories behind it all. As long as they're not straight-up plagiarists, which you definitely don't need an invasive browser extension to weed out; If they've learned the high-level theories and how to apply them, where in life are they not going to have available to them the low-level information that can be found by looking it up or asking a friend?\n\nEveryone learns differently. Not everyone does well on tests. If a 'cheater' makes it into the real world and it somehow doesn't notice that they are incompetent, are they truly incompetent? Can an incompetent person fake good performance? Is that good performance somehow less valuable? Or do their methods of reaching the same conclusion make you a diaper shit green shade of envy because you assume that you have had to work harder than them, that what they've done is easier and therefore unfair in some way?\n\nYou're going to label me a cheater and probably write me off. I'm not, but I don't need to justify myself to you and I don't need your approval. Tell me where I'm wrong. Change my mind.\n\nThe only person a true cheater; someone who performs badly because they don't take anything from their classes and are too 'lazy' to make up for it in some other way through hard work; hurts, is themselves. That is, unless you make your own life harder by worrying about them. They'll get what's coming to them if they deserve it, and so will you. Don't pay them any mind and move about your own business boo \ud83d\ude18",

Wouldn't be surprised if one of the 17 year old freshmen accidentally exposed themselves taking off a sweatshirt or something and pushed a lawsuit up Kettering's ass.\n\nKettering, I wouldn't push audio and video surveillance if I were you. You're treading along an extremely fine line between \"test proctoring\" and \"wiretapping\" or even worse.\n\nState legislation for wiretapping follows 1-sided consent. In other words, you must be actively partaking in a conversation in order to legally record it, otherwise it falls under eavesdropping/wiretapping.\n\nDeep-pocketed students, a lawsuit against Kettering would be absolutely hilarious and I would chip in $100 to watch it go down.",

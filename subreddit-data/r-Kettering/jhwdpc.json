    "postText": "B section,\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if y'all could stop inviting outside guests and Partying. Its pretty annoying to see that you cant seem to follow rules and just want to party. We understand its College and you want to have fun but do it in a safe way and stop putting our campus at risk. We were able to make it through A section with only 1-2 positive cases and keep our campus safe. Your risky behavior can potentially lead to A section not being able to return in the winter. Please be considerate and think about your actions. One term of not partying isnt going to kill you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yntty2i1s9v51.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cbdc6dca72b51a87df8c6ffaefdda37702dcc180",

Idk what you're motivation with this post is, but as a nation we are about to go through the worst months of COVID-19 we've ever had. If it so happens that we get an outbreak during our section, I hope you can understand that most of us are doing everything in our power to help Kettering's efforts. This email does not represents our efforts, and I find it pathetic that you singled out these people, and then address us directly as a whole section expecting us to answer you. I hope you're happy with what responses you've got but I'm betting you'll never be.\n\nI don't feel angry at those mentioned in this email. I'm glad they are quarantining, and I hope they are ok. That being said, was it risky to go to a party? Yeah, and some people in a-section will eat this up and share the same opinion as you, but somehow (IMO) you've made it sound like we are assholes for getting COVID-19. Lets hear all the things you have done to be socially distant during academic term. From the sound of your post, my guess is you're actually part of the problem, and you just wanted to piss us off and make us look bad for something that could have also just as easily happened to A-Section.",

This reminds me a lot of when the smash club was called out by a section students for \"not wearing masks and not following social distancing\" and being used as a scapegoat for why kettering was actively updating their rules (having spoken directly with the members of the club and their advisor the event took place following all guidelines and even followed some common sense that wasn't called out in guidelines like using their own controllers instead of sharing etc.) \n\nMaybe some freshmen need this message to stop going out and acting like this isn't a problem for them but as far as we know only 1 or 2 students have tested positive for now which is about the same as what we had heard about a section over in b-section. Additionally with how many courses are purely online it makes no sense to have had campus open up again this early only to expose the students to a risk. A-section don't be assholes and assume that the other section is any worse than your own, it's the same school and the same profs with the same management if you're following rules the same way we are why is there a need to be upset.",

It seems like the person who made this post is frustrated because B section is a few weeks in and already seeing 1-2 positive cases with the potential for a larger outbreak at the fraternity that was mentioned and the Thompson hall situation. I Do agree that we need more information on the situations and cant be quick to blame each other. To your point about being a message to student to stop going out I fully agree and I think we need to start thinking more about our choices and we all need to stop blaming each other.",

We are also ignoring the 2 kettering employees that got covid at the begining of a sections term pushing their confirmed cases up to 3-4 at the same time on the term that we are now. Regardless of how many cases are happening I Wich people would stop going out so much and just have fun with people online whenever possible to reduce how long this bullshit will last. Right now at week 3 we have two houses possibly having contact and a confirmed case in TH we may have confirmed at both houses and that would at most put us at 3 and being equal with a section at this point in the term. The post however targets b section for being idiots when A section was clearly superior in every way as anecdotally they had fewer confirmed cases Im their entire term. Yes people need to be careful but they also need to be careful of not being so quick to blame others for things that have happened. Tone means a lot where the title could have been \"please be careful\" instead of \"you guys are idiots\"\n\nEdit: also I'm totally agreeing with what's being said I just think that OP is being a dick when they don't need to be.",

Regardless of how B section does this term in terms of cases, if there's another wave of coronavirus, no one is coming back for the foreseeable future.\n\nI am impressed at how well A section did over the summer, I am also impressed with how B section is doing so far. So far neither section has had a large number of cases reported, people have been using their heads and the school has given many opportunities for everyone to get tested.\n\nI'm hoping this momentum will continue and all my fellow classmates in Thompson Hall will be safe and healthy",

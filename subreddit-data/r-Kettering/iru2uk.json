    "postText": "I lost my position at the company I Co-Oped at in June due to Covid. Since then I have been more or less shot gunning my resume on LinkedIn and Zip Recruiter, and I've gotten a whole one interview out of it so far.\n\nThe Co-Op office has been no help. They just directed me to another job recruiting website.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has had success doing differently. I have graduated as of June as well, so I would be looking for full time.\n\nI don't know. I know covid's still screwing everything up. I've just been getting extremely discouraged on everything, and I need help.",

            "comment": "The co-op office will not be of any help unless you're from an area that is awash in jobs.  If you're from somewhere like.... say Saginaw, you won't get any help whatsoever.\n\nI echo what RacecarTigers said below.  I hate to say it but look into Aerotek and RGBSI and TAC.  They're big firms to get warm bodies into engineering-ish roles.  You will probably not be happy and not paid well, but it's a job and if you can live at home, you'll be able to save most of your hourly rate.\n\nAlso, look into military suppliers.  TACOM, GD Land Systems, BAE (though I think they're still on hiring freeze; I'm still stuck in limbo/furlough hell right now), Raytheon, etc.  Depending on your location, one of those might work.  I love the schedule and the work isn't too out there and as long as things are good, you'll have plenty of work.  It's not fun and shiny like Google or Facebook, but the culture is fine.\n\nCo-op is kind of screwed right now and KU is going to have to reduce the requirements again to allow people in your situation to graduate on time.  This whole thing is a mess, and unfortunately, you're considered disposable, much like contractors.\n\nGood luck and I hope you can get something.  This whole thing sucks all around.",

            "comment": "Very sorry to hear that! I can understand your discouragement and have been in a somewhat similar situation myself before. I had a similar experience with the co-op office not being all that helpful.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have any magic process to get a job, but a few maybe helpful tips, though I'd imagine you're already doing these things:\n\n1) above all, do not give up! This is the hardest part.\n\n2) keep applying EVERYWHERE.\n\n3) leverage your network. Friends who have jobs, previous co-op co-workers who maybe found a job elsewhere, etc. Obviously don't be rude, but a kind message asking if they know if where they are is hiring. This isn't always fun, especially if you're introverted, but I've never heard of a person thinking negatively on someone looking for a job.\n\n4) last resort: find a recruiter/contract agency. I think you're actually likely to find a job this way, it's just you get paid less and less benefits. However I've known many people who did this, got their foot in the door at a company and got covered to a direct hire within a year or two.",

They came in, worked the exact same job as my co-op for about 20% higher pay than what I got for 1.5-2 years, and then all moved directly up into higher paying full time engineering/technician (depending on their degree) roles either with us or in our industry without much extra effort required on their part.\n\nAgencies like that do have some drawbacks, especially if you're just looking for a regular co-op, but for your introduction into full time work they can be a great resource.",

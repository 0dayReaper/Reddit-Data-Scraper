All of my previous pandemic courses were 100% virtual, so I'm coming late to the game here.\n\nSo, let me ask you this: what have you seen other professors do for hybrid courses that worked really well, or worked really poorly?   What advice would you like to give a professor doing this for the first time?\n\nTwo small requests for your responses:\n\n* Please don't make this personal.   \"Prof. Jones is an asshole\" may be true, but it doesn't help move the conversation forward.   \n* Please try to be specific.  \"Don't be an asshole like Prof. Jones\" is advice, but not exactly helpful.  \"Use only black markers on the whiteboard 'cuz the cameras suck\" is helpful, because I can act on that.  (And, yes, I've heard about markers already.)",

            "comment": "My professor kept on \"checking in\" and that was really helpful because I would otherwise feel I'm annoying the professor by repeatedly saying stuff like \"camera froze\", \"I cant see your handwriting\", etc. It just makes students feel more comfortable voicing the class concerns by knowing that the prof knows we're not trying to be picky, but we just need some extra help. So the prof kept saying \"is virtual all okay? Can you see and hear? Do you need me to change anything or move around?\"\n\nAlso, he would take note on what he lectured on and put a title on the board before starting a new topic then put the notes under that topic (like definitions and examples). This was helpful because some times being taught online you miss the actual broad topic name, so you might think you're learning one thing but the prof might have progressed to the next topic. \n\n\nI have a few more tips so I'll be updating this post. *\n\nAlso, thank you for caring so much! I do not have you as a professor but it is really nice to know you are trying to connect to the students so they get the best education",

Especially Prof. Jones, god he's an asshole. \n\nTo add to the above comment, in some classrooms the board is too long for the camera boundaries. If possible, try to maintain some level of awareness of these bounds on the board itself (perhaps draw them on the board before class if necessary). It's kind of a rare issue, but it really slows things down when someone has to point it out, wait for the prof to notice, adjust the camera, confirm it's fixed, then they go out of bounds again 2 minutes later.",

They would share the screen for virtual people and also project it onto the board for people in the classroom. It was functionally the same as writing on the board, and looked much better for the people online. The visibility for the in-person students was pretty good as well. And notes are also able to be uploaded, which was very nice. \n\nI'm not sure how you teach, but the downsides would be that you're kinda stuck at your desk or wherever you're using it from. It was a bit more difficult for in-person people since our professor was behind the plastic shields on the desks and was a little more difficult to hear, but not by a substantial amount. Also, I dont belive online people could see the professors face or room, just the notes (but that might be fixable, not sure).",

And, for a CS course at least, you'd be able to easily open any program since the computer's already up and running too. OneNote will allow you to have nearly infinite room. A single jamboard is limited to 20 \"boards\". If you want to import a pdf to write on top of, OneNote will let you but jamboard would not. Onenote has more colors and better highlighters. Jamboard can have students working on the same board (requires invitation and edit access) where they can type or write.\nI know some TA's are better than others. Generally, the entire length of the board is viewable but the TA may have to move a camera more and play around with the zoom almost constantly. Do not write one continuous line across the entire whiteboard. We can move the camera along the writing but we may go too quickly for note-taking that way though. And if we zoom out so it all fits, it is usually tiny and illegible. \nThe topic headers are a good idea.\nSome colored markers show up fine if the markers are still bold. I suggest investing in a refillable kit that you would need to bring each day. If the marker starts to become indiscernible we can let you know and you can fill it back up in a jiffy. Dr. Stiles of the Physics dept could probably offer suggestions on the brand or how much ink one needs.\nThat's all I can think of for now. Good luck.",

Most people I know dislike online classes as much as the professors and are very excited to get back to in person. \n\nThat being said, asking for students thought such as this before a course and not afterwards is great",

I know a lot of students cheated this past term (b section). Group discord calls, in person meetings (same frat house/ apartments) and chegg. The exam is usually 2 hours long, paste the 15 questions in chegg in the first 5 mins and you\u2019ll probably have the answers before the last half hour. Projects in a step by step learning manner helped a ton for me in learning the actual syllabus and helped me understand concepts better because I applied them ASAP for the project and it is more like real life experience. \nThis is a long shot but one-on-one seminars with students might help, maybe once or twice in a term with a 15 min checkin.",

            "comment": "If the prof is giving homework through Cengage Webassign, then there's no way around it - even if you bought the book, they'll have you buy webassign. One of the main things I learned after freshman year was not to buy anything until you meet the prof in a classroom setting. That's when they give you all the details of what application they're using for the homework and textbook, or if there is even any use for the textbook. For math, many of the profs are required by the dept. to use Webassign for their assigned hw, and the subscription come with the e-book in the purchase, so theres really no other option from what I know.\n\n\nIf they want you to buy JUST the textbook and there's no need for the Webassign for homework, then email them and say you already have it, and the profs usually are fine with whatever book you have.",

I'd just like to not have to pay $100 to access my work that accounts for 20% of my grade. This class costs enough already with Kettering's tuition through the roof. This is just ridiculous.",

I didnt even use the subscription in my Calc 3 class, but I would reccomend getting a multi term access because if you're required to use it in Calc 3, then you'll have to buy it again and it'll end up costing you more. Some of my friends in Diffy Eq right now said they're using Webassign again, so it might show up in that class as well if you're taking that in the future. I would reccomend talking to the chat support and asking for some discounted rate, if possible, since the current pandemic has a lot of people financially tight. \n\nSame for physics, as the other user said, they have you literally buy homework lol. Again, I'd recommend buying multi term/few years worth of access together because you definitely use Mastering Physics in both Phys1 and Phys2. \n\nIt's unfair and doesnt make sense but theres no way around it :/ I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news",

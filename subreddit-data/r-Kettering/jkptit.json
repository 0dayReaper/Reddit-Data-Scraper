A list of all guests (girlfriends/friends) that have been in contact with the fraternity was also sent to the school. Take Kettering\u2019s email with a grain of salt. \u201cContact tracing is in progress\u201d indicates that KU has not done their part to reach out to students that\u2019s were in close contact. \n\nThe wellness center has done a wonderful job, however they are dealing with a ton of obstacles placed by higher administrative that limits their help.\n\nEdit- A point of clarification as well, the 5 positive cases have done their own contact tracing and reached out to everyone in close contact with them. While Kettering might not be doing much with the contact tracing, we started reaching out to people within 10 minutes of finding out there were positive cases in the fraternity house. \n\nNot saying it\u2019s a bad or good thing to call out a fraternity house, I just do not appreciate you assuming we are not taking this seriously. Thank you.",

That being said, I think they wanted to make sure that if that wasn't the case, everyone was alerted. The Delts don't work for Kettering so they can't technically be forced to do the contact tracing work (even though they have done a great job doing this).",

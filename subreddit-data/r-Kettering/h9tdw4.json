    "postText": "Taking out the co-op (which honestly you can get a year-round internship if you just went to Wayne State) Is Kettering worth it anymore. \n\nTuition is outrageously high, I've had like 2 professors actually know what they're talking about, the curriculum seems outdated, I've never used an ounce of my education at work\n\nThe president is an overpaid figurehead who get upset by his student's opinions instead of finding ways to better the school \n\nWhat are your thoughts? What can the school do better? \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YytF2v7Vvw0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YytF2v7Vvw0)",

            "comment": "I had the option to go to University of Michigan and turned it down for many reasons. They mention they offer a co-op program but they are for students who are at junior level or higher. Kettering offers it right outside of high school. \n\nAs for using your degree, it\u2019s relative. I don\u2019t use the information I learned in college on a daily basis. It\u2019s more like once a month. I hardly use anything I learned in high school. The knowledge might seem outdated, but it\u2019s more the appliances. The techniques are mostly the same. \n\nLastly, the tuition is high, but we work most of the money back during co-op or by grants/scholarships. The main thing that is worth it is that the tuition is fixed once you attend. My friends at GVSU, Oakland, and State have all paid one rate during their freshman year that has either doubled or tripled by time they were on their last term.\n\nPerks that you haven\u2019t mentioned: \n- freshman can have cars on campus\n- classes are as small as high school and you get more one on one time\n- the maximum amount of walking we do on campus is 5 minutes\n- study abroad is available to almost anybody who applies\n-weeks are short so it\u2019s perfect for timing for right when you are fed up\n- dorms are small but you had a room pretty much to yourself\n- intramural sports is during the whole term and is available to anyone who wants to play\n\nWhat is not worth it:\n- campus cafeteria food is not the same as other school campuses\n- the water is safe to drink but you\u2019re a skeptic now \n- Atwood stadium is a question because we don\u2019t get to use it for sports (which is whatever), but graduation? Why stuff us in a small gym when we can spread out at the stadium.\n- technology is outdated but is in the process of being updated\n-waiting for the gross forms to get renovated and possibly let us put stuff on our doors or walls because we miss out in decorating during holidays \n- flintoids: Hit or miss\n- You won\u2019t be able to find any good sports gear or college gear anywhere but the school\u2019s store - which is limited in options. It is possible to make your own stuff but you need to request rights and takes a long time.\n\nThere\u2019s more I\u2019m probably missing, but tbh it\u2019s more worth the perks than some of the things it lacks. Especially for a school that\u2019s continuing to improve. You just have to find all of the good professors and enjoy the shorter weeks.",

            "comment": "Did you really just specify \"Taking out the co-op\" ?\n\nThe co-op is really an integral part of Kettering. Taking out the co-op would still result in students only having 11-12 week academic terms followed by 11-12 weeks of being able to do whatever you want? \n\nTypically college students only have time over the summer to be employed at a GOOD job. Now I am not saying everyone has a good job at Kettering, but the employment opportunities and the fact that working is a requirement rather than a \"recommendation\"  really sets those who would rather relax and take a break from those who are willing to start their careers and work full time while managing a large course load the other parts of the year. \n\nTuition will suck anywhere, that isn't just a Kettering problem. Other schools though are less likely to actually get you a job that pays you enough to sufficiently pay your loans and at the same time have money leftover and not have to worry about things. There are many different things that separate the University, ROI for example ( [https://news.kettering.edu/news/kettering-university-ranks-24th-nationally-return-investment#:\\~:text=On%20average%2C%20Kettering%20University%20graduates,and%20first%20in%20the%20Midwest.](https://news.kettering.edu/news/kettering-university-ranks-24th-nationally-return-investment#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20Kettering%20University%20graduates,and%20first%20in%20the%20Midwest.) ) Not all professors actually know what they are talking about, but I do know that many professor are very smart and actually do research over interesting things. The president is overpaid but this problem is not unique? I feel like he sits around a lot, but I have heard he brings a lot of money to the university through grants and other things (which is very important). So although he is paid well, the university likely is net positive due to him being in that position. \n\nEmployers will not always take advantage of the knowledge you obtain through the university, but this is also not a thing you will only experience through Kettering co-op opportunities? Most of the knowledge I have obtained has been through working, but this isn't something I am very surprised by? You should be annoyed by this, we all are, but this problem is likely to be worse at other universities where employers may not know they are looking for a different major and want an engineering major because they expect them to be a hard worker. Imagine having a job that isn't even related to your major. I am sure the likelihood of this is much higher at other universities. \n\nOne thing I think the school could do better is have increased communication between students and the president specifically. I think a biweekly or once a month update or something from the president would be interesting and would actually highlight things. The usual emails from the university are interesting and all, but I think this would make people feel less like the president is just an overpaid figurehead and be able to hear from him.  \n\nAlso, as t258721 specified, it is the end of an academic term so don't beat yourself up.",

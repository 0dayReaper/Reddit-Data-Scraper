You know, the ones that put themselves in the public eye outside of recruitment.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I believe these are also the houses (lambda, sig chi, delts, pikes) with the most visible philanthropy (sig chi and delts in particular) and that tend to attract the most membership in general. In fact, those 4/11 houses made up 141/293 active fraternity members last term, with DTD and sigs being the two biggest frats on campus (40-43 members each, smallest houses are 13-14). 36% of houses holding 46% of Greek men isn't a huge jump, but it's significant enough to explain that.\n\nTL;DR don't let memes about Greek houses influence your decision where/when to go Greek if you choose to do so. Usually those memes don't take into account the bigger picture and actually have nothing to do with the experience you'll have in the house itself. The bigger houses get bandwagoned on just because they're easy targets and some people are bad sports.",

I know sig chi has derby days, fiji has 3v3 basketball, pike has bikes and blood drive, and delta chi does their fried oreos but that's about all philanthropy I know about",

Delts have JDRF though, I believe they have events like hockey games once in a while to support that. The logo is fairly prominently displayed throughout their house.\n\nLike I said, they're party houses. Parties are a calculated risk, and they're getting riskier every day as the public decides that college parties are bad. There's kind of an expectation for them to be headasses more often than the dry houses. In a \"yeah that's pretty much what I expected\" way. Since their parties make them more relevant, most of their shit is just out there for the world to see. The delts get put on so-pro, they have our attention and we all know about it. If theta xi or fiji had pulled rush tits and if Cheyenne even hears about it, I'm not sure the punishment wouldn't be something lesser than what the delts got for it, and you probably wouldn't have heard about it.\n\nThat might be a bad example because I can't imagine those houses pulling rush tits, but to be fair I didn't imagine delts doing it either. It was just stupid all around. I couldn't think of anything else a house had gotten in trouble for, other than fudging numbers on an attendance list, which is exclusively a party thing.\n\nMy point is that the big houses are on a much shorter leash and when they do dumb shit or get in trouble, more people are going to know about it, including Cheyenne.\n\nEdit: revised some stuff for more clarity, but it all says the same thing. I type too much. Apologies lol.",

Theta Xi has various unthemed philanthropic events that take place in the school year. Phi Delts had the carnival last year if I remember right. Betas had the pepper thing last year. Delta Chi also did the smoothie ingredients last year. All fraternities are required to do Philanthropy and participate in Relay for Life usually.",

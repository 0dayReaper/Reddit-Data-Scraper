I\u2019m going to fail all of my classes because everyone as usual is going to avoid me because they hate me. No one ever fucking talks to me and r attempts any kind of interaction because I\u2019m just a fucking burden. The professors know I\u2019m already a failure with no future, since I\u2019ve failed every lab course I\u2019ve taken, and I have no idea what I\u2019m doing without some help or guidance whilst all alone. I\u2019m fucking done with this shit. I have no future.",

There becomes a point where the only thing left is for you to look in the mirror and see what type of man you want to be, not the one you think you'll turn into. Keep wallowing in this negative mentality and you'll drown in it. If you think you're a fucking idiot then that will never change no matter what you do. I've been in your shoes, hell, still kind of am. Winter 2019 I failed 2 classes and lost a coop because I was depressed and could barely leave bed. Take some initiative and do something to make your life better and become less of a hateful antisocial retard.",

I lost scholarships ( 10\u2019s of thousands of dollars) because I couldn\u2019t get my shit together. It took me an extra 2 years to finish school.\n\nGo talk to someone. It can and will get better if you give a fuck and put in the effort. Don\u2019t wallow in your failure. Use this to grow. Talk to your profs (it\u2019s probably too late for this semester but try) they are pretty understanding. I\u2019ve been given more opportunities than I deserved because I told them I was struggling. \n\nAnd honestly, decide if you really want this\n\nPm me if you want to talk\n\nEdit: spelling",

    "postText": "I am trying to decide on Kettering for CS or UofM (LSA CS). \n\n1. I am not really an automotive guy but into robotics programming. Does CS currently have decent co-op opportunities for Freshmen or in general?\n2. I am not afraid of work and good instruction is important to me. So how are the majority of instructors that I would come across for CS? \n3. I heard whisperings of changes within CS at Kettering. For the better, worse, thoughts?\n\nAt this point, they are the same price point (factoring in a low-paying CO-OP). Flint vs. Ann Arbor is of little difference to me. The size of Kettering appeals to me but maybe that is just what I am used to and need to branch out. Thanks in advance.",

I would avoid the IT jobs and there are a fair amount of them\n\n2. My experience may be different from my classmates' but I actually enjoyed the majority of my CS courses. I had good experiences with Prof. Wang, Huggins, Vineyard, Turini, and even Kanchi. This may be extreme but you can also do study abroad or guest credits with other schools if you really want to avoid a prof. I had a friend actually go to Germany to avoid taking a specific class with a certain prof but I took it here and it was fine lol. There are new profs in the department and I don't think Geske is there anymore so I defer to other commenters about them.\n\n3. No idea, but Dr. Huggins is pretty active in the sub and may be able to give you a hint :)",

I believe it was 12 credits were dropped from the total coursework (1 science elective, 1 writing intensive elective, and 1 free elective). All of the major requirements are still the same, but the CS department trimmed some extra classes that are currently required to graduate but are not applicable to the major. Dr. Huggins and Kettering university resources in general are good places to retrieve information about this change, but I believe the change is a beneficial one and will help students to graduate on time.",

Most likely it will be automotive or at a small finance company (I'm at Ford atm). UofM draws in a lot of software companies, and the name tends to hold some weight with them. It's still possible to get into them here though (I'm going to Seattle for an Amazon internship this summer)\n\n2. I honestly don't show up to classes much, but Huggins and Turini are great, and I hear good things about Farmer. It's difficult to get an A in Vineyard classes so I'd honestly stay away if possible (protecting my 3.9 ya know?). I think the resources you get can help self directed students a lot, and I've learned a ton (from zero programming knowledge to Ford to $53/hr at Amazon).\n\n3. It's for the better. 2 less Liberal Studdies, 1 less math, 1 less science. We had too many general courses previously. \n\nI think both choices are great, but the co-op program is hard to beat. Feel free to ask questions.",

            "comment": "I am a senior 1 in CS \nI did my co-op at an automotive OEM since freshman year and recently got an internship with a faang company. \n\n1) if you don\u2019t want to work in the automotive industry or at a random insurance company then the career fair likely won\u2019t be much help for breaking out of those industries. The biggest companies that come are usually Ford, GM, Stellantis, and Bosch. It\u2019s definitely much harder to get internships and co-ops outside of those but not impossible if you are good. Specifically at UofM Ann Arbor, there are many great companies that go to their career fair including big name tech companies. \n\n2) there are two professors for CS that I absolutely love. Dr. Huggins is great and really makes the classes fun and interesting(as much as a class like theory of comp can be). Dr. Farmer, the new department head is also a great prof who I took software engineering with. I think he also teaches an AI elective. Other than those two, that\u2019s about it. The rest are usually just robotically reading off of a slide show which is quite frustrating. I think from what I have heard UofM Ann Arbor is like top 10 in the country for CS but that\u2019s likely from and outside view looking in so I\u2019m not too sure of how good it actually is. The name itself does hold a lot of weight though\n\n3) the CS curriculum changed from 161 credits to 141. They removed 2 liberal studies/humanity classes, 1 math elective, and 2 lab science electives. For my case, I front-loaded my cs classes so this change actually will take a whole 20 credits off of my degree which is great. I think that this change is a step in the right direction since in reality another science class for example is not going to help us in our careers. \n\nI think that many students including myself love to complain about all sorts of things here but the reality is it\u2019s a good school. It has helped me out a ton and has given me about 1.5 years of internship experience already. That being said if I had the opportunity to either go to UofM Ann Arbor or Kettering, I would choose UofM every day of the week just because it\u2019s well know outside of the automotive industry. You will have a better opportunity to swing a high paying internship with a faang company for example.",

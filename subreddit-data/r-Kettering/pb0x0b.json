    "postText": "For those who don\u2019t know him Mr. David Lucas, an admissions counselor for the school, is leaving Kettering. David was an exceptional example of what Kettering university faculty SHOULD STRIVE TO BE. David cared for the students he brought In and guided them until they left Kettering as successful alumni. With all the bad Kettering has to offer it\u2019s a shame to see someone so good go. Reach out to him if you know him!",

    "postText": "Do any of you use some kind of video editing software to download blackboard videos and speed them up. About 60% of the time spent is filler, and I could really use the time to study more instead of listening to bullshit for 2 hours. If I could condense the video into about half its length, that would be pretty helpful .",

If so, copy the link, paste it into a new browser, save and download.\n\nI have video editing software I would be happy to compress the videos for you if you can get a bunch downloaded.",

But if you are able to you could upload them as private youtube videos and just play them at different speeds using that. \n\nInstead of relying on professors to record the lectures I was recording them via StreamLabs.",

Long story short you need open up the recording, use inspect element (right click, inspect) on the player, find the source url for the video, click on that and on the player that loads it, you will have an option to download the video. Trust me, it works, I grabbed an entire term worth of Operating Systems lectures for a buddy of mine that way. I'd post a how to video, but alum.",

I use VLC player to watch the lectures faster. You can do this by right-clicking on the video you open then going to Playback -&gt; Speed.",

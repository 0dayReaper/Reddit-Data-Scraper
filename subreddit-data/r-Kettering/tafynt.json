    "postText": "Okay, whiny old man here.   Things have been quite around this sub for awhile, so maybe I'll stir things up a bit.  Really, though, I need some insight into student pandemic-era mentality.\n\nI'm teaching two classes this term.   Okay, we can all agree that having the first three weeks online sucked, and we're all glad that's behind us.   Or ... are we?\n\nSee, it's week 9.\n\n* Today, in my morning class of 15 students, I had ***3*** show up live, and 10 watch the \"supplemental recording\" live as I was making it (that is, 10 showed up on Collaborate).\n* Yesterday, in my afternoon class of 9 students, I had ***1*** show up live, and 6 watch the \"supplemental recording\" live.\n\nHonestly, for me, this is no better than lecturing from my basement.   Worse, perhaps, because nobody online is even trying to interact with me.\n\nNow, some of this is my \"fault\":\n\n* I don't grade on attendance.  If I grade on attendance, then I have to deal with all the emails about \"I'm not sure if I should come to class because I'm sick but I don't want to lose points\".  There's a pandemic going on, and the last thing I want to do is encourage unhealthy behavior.   I could grade based on attendance, but then I become one of those profs y'all love to hate.\n* I'm also going out of my way to create \"supplemental recordings\" that are actually useful.   I'm working almost exclusively from digital slides, which have all the disadvantages of \"death-by-Powerpoint\", but at least are readable --- as opposed to grainy camera views of a whiteboard.   Which means that the recordings are probably a comparable experience to sitting in class.   I suppose if I was a crappier teacher, I might get better attendance.\n\nAnd, look, I get why people don't want to come to class.  It's winter in Michigan, which means the roads suck and the weather sucks.   Oh, and war is breaking out in Europe, so gas prices suck too.\n\nBut to be brutally honest here ... I do a better job teaching when I can see student faces, and can have a live Q&amp;A with my students.   The few students who are still attending are loyal and all, but I really feel like I'm letting everyone down.  \n\nSo, let me put it to you:\n\n* If you're physically attending class, why?  What helps drag your butt out of bed every morning?\n* If you're not physically attending class, why not?  What would make a difference in helping you to come to class?\n\nThis is a judgment-free question.   I'm trying to figure out what y'all are thinking, so I can be a better instructor.   \n\n(And, yeah, okay, I'm whining a little bit.   Believe it or not, your instructors are human, too.)",

I try to attend classes in person as much as possible, but there are times when it isn't feasible.\n\nGranted, depression and the expense of gas don't help with attending in person. I did get some COVID relief funds, but it still isn't enough to offset the cost of gas for me, and my co-op doesn't pay me enough over work terms.\n\nI've been trying really hard to attend lately, but seeing my bank account hitting the lowest it has ever been in 3 years (even after cutting expenses) has taken its toll on my mental health.\n\nThis past work term, I was begging for overtime hours; it didn't make a difference when I did get them.\n\nTL;DR: depression, expense of living, and getting tight on funds have caused a lot of stress that has taken me down the path of convenience to try to manage my stress.",

I get it; it's an attempt to exert control over an otherwise uncontrollable situation.   That doesn't necessarily help me to see a course of action ... but it does change the way I think about my students a little bit.",

Anyways, first off, I think virtual works for some classes and some people. Math I am completely clueless if I'm online but for history and ethics on computers I could get your message. So when students say \"online sucks\" I always assumed it was talking about the vast majority of classes that rely on physicality along with the fact a lot of professors don't understand blackboard \n\nWhen I did physically attend class it was because I felt like I was doing good for myself by getting out of the house in the morning, and when I stayed in, it was because I was groggy or was running late and even though you didn't have an attendance policy, I thought showing up on time virtually was better than showing up 10-20 minutes late physically. \n\nAs for solutions, maybe EC for showing up in person and engaging in the class. \n\nOne that might be a good compromise is if they're online, you have to contribute to discussion one time in order to not get marked down let's say, you lose a point if you're not physically in class but you gain it back if you input to the discussion",

Kettering burns me out and, no matter how motivated I am in the beginning, my attendance usually starts getting way worse sometime after midterms are over.\n2. If I feel like I'm not missing anything from just watching a recording later, then I feel no need to get up in the morning instead of just taking notes and learning at my own pace.\n3. I don't like people. LOL\n\nI understand the problem and of course you can do whatever you want since it's your class. But attendance policies just kind of irk me. I'm an adult and I'm paying for my own education. I guess I just feel that, if I'm doing well on assignments and tests, if I write well-written and knowledgeable papers, and if I make a quality final project or whatever, the hill that my grade dies on shouldn't be attendance.\n\nI prefer the idea of having in-class assignments/discussions for points, because those enhance learning, and you can actually make an argument for it not being replaceable by watching a recording.",

I\u2019m not sure exactly what it is that causes this for me, but some type of switch in my brain is off and will not turn on when listening to a blackboard lecture. My grades suffered heavily due to this during the full online terms since I refuse to cheat, so I go to class in person no matter what (obviously excluding if I have symptoms or a real reason to miss class). The difference in my academic performance and understanding of materials is night and day when comparing online to in person. \n\nAll of my classes this term have had pretty much full in person attendance, so that\u2019s disappointing to hear that many students still aren\u2019t showing up. To be fair though all my professors take attendance and require in person. Only thing I could recommend to fix that problem is require in person attendance unless you\u2019re sick/have an actual reason not to be there. I\u2019m not a professor though so I could just be spitting dumb statements right now. \n\nFrom my perspective, it seems that since the option to stay home was given, the majority of people thought \u201cWhy not stay home?\u201d",

Online classes with the prof just droning on to the mic and being on my computer with access to distracting programs and such makes it really hard to focus. And I give props to the profs that come to class and give a good and entertaining lecture is so much better even while having to wake up for an 8am. \n\nFrom what I understand from your posts you really care about your students learning.

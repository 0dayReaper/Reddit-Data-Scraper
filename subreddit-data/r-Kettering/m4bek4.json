One of my friends almost wasn't able to graduate on time with a CE major because not enough sections of a few classes were offered (I was able to get him an independent study). And, from talking to professors, they are already looking into hiring more profs for departments that actually require those resources. Also, tuition has remained the same while financial aid and scholarships are increasing, making the cost more accessible to more people. This admin has done a lot of stuff I personally disagree with, like spending $150 million on a building that no one will ever use, but this is the right call imo.",

They need to help understaffed departments and work on their ridiculous tuition rate, but I don\u2019t think slashing programs that they already have established and all the expensive equipment for is going to help. Some of those chemistry labs are new since I started in 2015, and it\u2019s not like most engineering degrees could utilize those spaces. Either they\u2019re going to waste money redoing new areas, or those spaces are going to sit empty which is also a waste.",

I don't think they would repeat this under normal circumstances, but they definitely cannot get away with continuing to increase tuition. I think we can agree on that much. A lot of the incoming students I talked to said they decided to go here because the aid package they got made it affordable relative to their other options.",

But the fact that they themselves said it wasn\u2019t then there\u2019s no real reason to do it. \n\nEveryone in the administration is a coward. McMahon disappointments me immensely",

And I am very carefully not offering an opinion on the decision.)\n\n1) You can be prepared for medical school without majoring in chemistry or biology, as long as you take enough of those courses to pass the MCATs.   (In fact, some people claim that it's **better** not to major in chemistry or biology, because you'll bring a more diverse set of experiences to medical school, and your application will stand out in the crowd of chemistry and biology majors.)  I have no knowledge of future plans for the pre-med course of study, but eliminating the degree programs doesn't have to affect that.\n\n2) There's a difference between saying that this was done for \"financial reasons\" and saying that this was done because of a \"financial emergency\".   This is a subtlety in Dr. McMahan's letter.   My understanding is that Kettering does not have a financial emergency *right now* \\--- nobody's been laid off, nobody's been forced to take a pay cut, and tuition is remaining level for the second straight year.   But that doesn't mean that one doesn't look at the long-term picture and decide to make decisions *now* that might free up resources years from now.",

Tell me, are they going to keep biochemistry 2 when they are no longer offering the major that contained the students that required that class? Sure. You can chose a diverse undergraduate path but I don\u2019t recall an electrical engineering portion of the MCAT. Though you are correct. There are kinesiologists out there. \n\n2) That just brings up my initial point. Be honest with why they move is being done. And again. If resources can be freed up then I can think of more things that can be cut. \n\nThis university makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Just have some balls about being honest with what you\u2019re going to do.",

If they think people majoring in Biochem or Bio isn\u2019t enough to offer the majors, how are they gonna get enough premeds around to offer the courses needed for premed from those majors? Of my Biochem II class, there were six of us and four of them were premed. It\u2019s hard to get a class offered for six people (four of which needed it to graduate which is why we had the chance), trying to get it offered for less when it\u2019s not a formal requirement for any of them will be harder.",

    "postText": "Hey there ... old guy is back, looking for more advice.\n\nI'm told that the operational plans Kettering used in Spring '22 are the \"new normal\" procedures moving forward.   In particular, faculty are required to record lectures as \"supplemental materials\", using existing classroom technology.   But these lectures are supplemental materials only; faculty can impose whatever attendance policies they choose.\n\nSo, I'm thinking about my upcoming summer courses (well, one of them), and thinking about how I want to conduct my lectures.  I have a few options.\n\n**Option One**: write on the whiteboard (like in the \"good old days\").\n\n* **Pros**: less work for me ahead of time; I can respond dynamically to what happens in the classroom and adapt my presentation; I can pretty much do \"whatever\" I want.\n* **Cons**: the supplemental recordings will suck: the image quality sucks unless someone is actively running the camera, and I can't run the camera and give the lecture at the same time.  (Even then, the image quality is never great.)\n\n**Option Two**: use pre-prepared slides (e.g. PowerPoint, LaTeX, Google Slides)\n\n* **Pros**: recordings will have fantastic image quality; students can download slides directly and spend less time copying notes; pre-prepared slides can have pretty high quality for all\n* **Cons**: \"death by PowerPoint\" as I end up blindly clicking through slides; more work for me (initially) in setting up the first set of slide decks; more difficult to adapt lectures on-the-fly when students take class in a different direction; a few students will think that they can get by with just the slides and quit attending class, hurting their own performance (and my ego)\n\n**Option Three:** generate slides live with digital tools (e.g. OneNote, Google Docs, Notepad)\n\n* **Pros**: content generated live, so can adapt to student needs; digital format still allows students to download files after the lecture (once I remember to upload them); recordings will still show some high-quality images\n* **Cons**: digital tools suck for writing in some subjects (like math); presentations will be less smooth as old fart instructors struggle with the tools\n\nI've been following Option Two or Three, depending on the course --- mostly by necessity, and perhaps by default.   But since supplemental recordings appears to be the \"new normal\", I should really make this a conscious decision as we move forward.\n\nSo, I'll put it to you.  Which mode do you prefer, and why?    I've put this into an attached poll, but for me, knowing *why* you prefer a given mode is the most interesting to me.\n\nThanks again for helping the old fart out.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/vd4wp8)",

The recordings are focused on quality, real-time drawings/writing and it's replicated on the projector for the class.\n\nThis also provides flexibility for those that like to have a number of prepared slides, but want to have sections of in-person calculations or note-taking as well.",

Not that you should have to spend extra money on it, I think Kettering should really keep a stock of such a thing for faculty to checkout. But then again, I think many/most of the rooms do have the one monitor that is (from my understanding) touch sensitive.\n\nPerhaps you might just need an adapter for a second external screen for your laptop? I do that to run a second monitor and a projector for my laptop when I want to be able to switch between my Netflix marathons and studying.",

At the same time, the \"standard classroom configuration\" assumes I'm using the classroom desktop computer, which (as I noted) isn't always practical when a CS instructor needs to demo specialized stuff.\n\nEvery term, we iterate through and try new stuff.

New tools always feel clunky at first, and they haven't been refined in development for such intensive use as new practices call for. Do the best with what you have, practice repeating the the techniques you notice work well, try to refine or replace the ones that don't, and share with colleagues to interweave premade assets that will express topics clearly that might otherwise be difficult or time consuming to replicate on the fly.\n\nBest of luck, and thank you for being an excellent leader :)",

            "comment": "I'd say the exact answer is very dependent on the course. For example, in a mostly talking class like Senior Seminar or Philosophy, option 1 works good enough. For the more technical classes, I'd say a hybrid between 2 and 3 is the best (by hybrid, I mean have some pre-set slides that are then live annotated). I know professor Foster has used this method for the past couple years to great effect.   \n\n\nAnother interesting option is the more advanced functionalities afforded by OneNote. It's relatively simple to upload entire pages of pre-planned notes to it, and then you can use the tablets to draw further explanations or diagrams on top of it. Once the class is over, you can share a single link that'll give students access to a complete read-only version of the notebook, which will automatically update as the term progresses. Professor Nam switched to this method about halfway through this term for my Financial Mathematics course, and it's been a wonderful resource to refer back to since all his in-class annotations are preserved without him having to manually export them to PDF format and upload to blackboard or me having to scroll back through hours of lectures just to get the single equation I forgot to write down.  \n\n\nAs for your laptop troubles, have you checked if your laptop supports something like Thunderbolt? Most business class laptops made since \\~2017 have it, and it allows you to run a monitor off a USB-C port on the computer via a dongle. It might take a little personal investment, but with the right configuration you should be able to mirror the same screen off the laptop, tablet, and projector all at once.",

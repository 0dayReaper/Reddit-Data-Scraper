Oakland is even letting you choose which class you want to count for your GPA apparently.\n\nSo far U of M Dearborn and Oakland University are under this policy as far as I'm aware... and they're only half done with their terms...\n\nSad boy hours for us Kettering bois in 11th week. Good luck everybody",

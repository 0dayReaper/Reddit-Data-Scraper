I really think that if you have so much time to be monitoring your old college Reddit and making rude comments its time for you to find real job because obviously you dont have one. Its pretty useless to keep bringing hate to our school and I hope that the moderators of this Reddit eventually catch on to you and ban you from this Reddit. Kettering is a fairly good school and has a great reputation in the Engineering and Automotive community. So I think a lot of people would appreciate if you stop hating on our school. Yes people make fun of Kettering on this forum but a lot of it is to vent from stress while you on the other hand seem to be trying to bring hate and disrespect our community. u/yertass u/shadow503",

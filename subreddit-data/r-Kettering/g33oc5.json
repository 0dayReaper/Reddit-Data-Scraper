    "postText": "So I saw a few articles and other universities have been signing petitions to get their respective universities to reduce tuition cost. It's helped or offered some push on the students part at a few universities, and I know spring term is already well underway, but would you guys be interested in creating/signing one? It may help us since it'll be something backing us if the administration says something about students not actually supporting it.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/g33oc5)",

            "comment": "I really wish Kettering were less expensive so I could save up money from working, but I don't think that reducing coat is the right answer right now. Kettering still has the same expenses as it would if we were in session. Minus a couple of positions everyone is still working to keep Kettering running they might have reduced the cost of heat or electric bill somewhat but every prof that is teaching courses as best they can is still getting paid. If there were a salary cut temporarily from this I think it really should go down as they would be charging students the same while also lowering the expenses from paying their employees.\n\n(Cheaper would be nice just in general)",

As someone who's been around the institution for 23 years, let me say this: we've had higher tuition and lower tuition, and lowering tuition doesn't increase the number of enrolled students.  I only partially understand the reasons (it has a lot to do with market psychology), but I've lived through it for enough years to see the truth of it.  (It's not as simple as ECON-201 would lead you to believe.)",

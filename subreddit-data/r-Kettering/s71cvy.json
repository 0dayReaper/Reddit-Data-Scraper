I have no training in epidemiology or public health or higher education politics.   I'm planning for virtual instruction indefinitely, because it'll be easier for me to transition to in-person from virtual than the other way around.   I'm hoping that conditions improve so that we can go back to in-person ---- not because I'd rather be in person (which I do) but because I'm tired of my friends getting COVID and dying (which they are).\n\nI have no idea what Kettering will decide to do.  That's a decision above my pay grade, and I'm glad it's not my decision to make.",

But I'm also aware that any prediction I make will be misinterpreted as an Official University Policy^(TM), and then when I'm wrong, someone else will complain that \"PROFESSOR HUGGINS LIED TO ME\" and ... well, the story doesn't end well after that.\n\nI really don't envy those who have to make that decision right now.   There are tons of strong feelings right now within the University about our response, ranging from \"we should've stayed online from the beginning\" to \"we should be full open, anything goes\".   I suspect that applies equally to the student body as well.   I haven't agreed with every decision they've made, but I've given them the benefit of the doubt, because they could quite easily be correct and I could be the one who is wrong about all this stuff.   (And right now, every decision is full of uncertainty.)",

It takes a couple people: the talent, the technical director, and anyone else who may need to operate equipment that isn't within the TD's reach. It's like trying to do jumping jacks while pouring yourself a glass of milk to do it on your own, it doesn't go well.\n\nBefore trying to comparing it to gaming streamers - they are on their computers 99% of the time and not handling the audience as often as a professor would need to.

This is especially the case for people who are under the age of 40, aren't overweight, and don't have any underlying health conditions (like chronic asthma).\n\nIf you go here (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographicsovertime), zoom in to the last couple of weeks, and flip between \"Cases\" and \"Deaths\" by \"Age - All Groups\", you can see that older people are not catching it as often, but (unfortunately) still make up the vast majority of deaths.\n\nAre we going to see a lagging spike in deaths given the recent spike in omicron cases?  Time will tell.  But surely, young and relatively healthy individuals are not at a particularly high risk.",

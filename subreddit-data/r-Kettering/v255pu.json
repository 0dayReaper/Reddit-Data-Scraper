    "postText": "Hey Everyone,\u00a0\n\nI'm a graduating senior (less than 3 weeks to go!) with a \\[fairly recently\\] approved thesis.\n\nI struggled to figure the whole KU thesis thing out, hitting a lot of different\u00a0roadblocks along the way. Therefore, I decided to create documentation as a way to keep my thesis\u00a0on track for graduation.\n\nNow that I have an approved\u00a0thesis, I've revised the\u00a0documentation to guide others through the process!\n\nIt's designed specifically for students whose companies\u00a0have never had a thesis co-op before. It walks you through the process in excruciating detail.\n\nAll relevant KU Thesis forms have also been copied into the folder for easy\u00a0reference.\n\n[Here's the link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bYDkh2nsMkXwGAPs2GbyLRUsE2fQy5fm?usp=sharing) for those interested (use your KU email to\u00a0view).\u00a0\n\nFeel free to leave feedback or suggest edits. Hoping my obsessive\u00a0need for some form of written process documentation will help someone else. :-)\n\n  \nEdit: Thank you so much to whoever gifted the gold! So happy my little project helped you.",

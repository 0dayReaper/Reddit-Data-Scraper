Is anyone else in the same situation? \n\nI probably have about 30 hours of work left on my thesis, and I spent well over 300 hours working on it last work term. I started my thesis two terms later then usual thanks to COVID. I stayed optimistic though at thought I could get everything done by 2nd week. I felt really burned out after work term, and I didn\u2019t end up reaching that goal. \n\nNow it\u2019s fifth week and I will have to devote a lot of time to my thesis once I finish my exams this week. It\u2019s my only hope at this point. I\u2019ve contacted my co-op already and spoke with my thesis coordinator. I don\u2019t regret doing a co-op thesis, but the pressure is real and I\u2019ve had a pretty rough start so far.",

Whatever anyone else tells you, you have time.  Focus on getting through this term intact and then buckle down after a brief reprieve- don\u2019t wait five years but give yourself some leeway and take care of yourself.  Kettering is brutal, don\u2019t let it ruin you or your life, even temporarily.",

But in hindsight I probably should have mentioned it before setting lofty goals for the term.\n\nI do feel less burned out now though so I am going to grind it out over the next couple of weeks. It is my last term after all, and I will have more time available once my midterms are over.",

Admitting that you\u2019ve overextended yourself with a worthwhile explanation (I have 20 credits in my final term, I want to ensure quality therefore I need additional time) could be seen as an asset; you\u2019re self-aware enough to be quality in the long-term.  Just food for thought.  Good luck, and like I said take care of yourself.  If you\u2019re up for updating down the line I\u2019d be interested in reading.",

I've had thesis students whose projects didn't turn out as they expected, because of all sorts of complications.  In most cases, they had already done more than enough to \"count\" as a thesis, even if it was less than they'd planned.   (And that was without a pandemic or a recession going on.)   I had absolutely no problem signing off on what they'd accomplished, as did their employer advisor.\n\nNow, I obviously don't know your particular situation, and every academic advisor is different.  But there's really no reason not to talk to your academic advisor about the situation.   Worst case, nothing changes.   Best case, you adjust your expectations down a bit.",

Many of the topics in my thesis are already simplified to some extent and I've gotten alot of help and support from my employer advisor.\n\nAs far as thesis expectations go, I recently met with my employer advisor to discuss how things were going. They are still firm on their expectations... I was paid to work on my thesis during the term, so they are very adamant that I deliver on the origional expectations. Becuase of that, I'm reluctant to change the expectations. However, worse case scenario, I will consider doing that. I'm confident that I could make a thesis out of the work that I've already completed thus far.",

I\u2019m not trying to win any awards, just graduate. \n\nThe expectations we put on ourselves for the thesis really are greater than that of what Kettering expects. You don\u2019t have to finish all the experiments and science behind your thesis. It\u2019s okay to write that you got up to point X, and that if the project were to continue you would take it down Y route and expect Z result. It\u2019s just a big lab report. Write about what you have done, how it\u2019s met your expectations so far, and how you would continue it and what the expected results would be (the latter two only if the science work isn\u2019t done).",

Definently needed that time in between to just relax and take things slowly. \n\nDon't rush yourself with the thesis, and put as much effort as you want with it. Kettering doesn't care much about the details as long as it fits the requirements. So it really depends on your company and advisor. \n\nI'd you are going for a Masters, or applying for a company that is unaware of Kettering, you will have difficulty applying before finishing your Thesis. You will also waiting some time period after until you can officially graduate. Make sure you finish and submit a few months you need your actual degree.",

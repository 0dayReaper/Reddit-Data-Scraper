    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed it, but the campus security guy who's checking temperatures in the AB entryway is basically sitting in an oven.  He was talking to someone when I walked past about how he can't get a fan because the nearest outlet is too far away and I just feel pretty bad for the guy.  Is there anything we could do for the guy?  Whether or not you agree with the temp scan and questionnaire it sucks that he's stuck in a 90\u00b0f entryway",

            "comment": "I don't take issue with wearing a mask and keeping distance but the way it was stated is just a bit strange in my opinion. also definitely looking forwards to the apple bobbing contest that they're apparently putting on according to their poster board.   \n\n\nI do however take issue with the school treating the organizations on and off campus like they're unable to work around restrictions like food safety and sanitation and then charges ahead and acts like the rules they've applied to these orgs don't need to be applied to themselves when both parties could use the same care. for example not serving food or drinks and then making an event that includes food and drink because they're running it. its just little things that irk the student body and pile up over time. Would love to work with the school on relaxing some of the ruling for Greek Life specifically in the food department when prepared by a hired cook in a sanitary environment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat said, if you're interested in the fall fest please don't let me dissuade you from going, personally I plan on attending to enjoy some of the fun I hope to see many others there from a safe distance since my term has been pretty secluded. Have a great night!",

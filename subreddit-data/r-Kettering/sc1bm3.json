The flu was debilitating for me, chills, fever, unbelievable aches, zero energy, horrendous sinus garbage. Covid for me was like that for 2 days (day 2 and 3), then it resolved into more like a sinus infection until full recovery.\n\n*Pro tip: humidity is extremely important for reducing sinus irritation, but allergy meds and fluticasone (flonase) makes a huge difference. I went through 2 boxes of cold meds, 2 small bags of cough drops, and obnoxious amounts of nasal spray.*\n\nI wouldn't consider it to be ungodly awful, however it is no fun to get. My take? Avoid getting it like avoid getting the flu. Neither are enjoyable. Would it kill you or put you in the hospital? Not likely if you're not someone who is already at-risk with the flu (like those with compromised immune systems). The common cold can be the breeze that pushes the elderly off the proverbial edge and land them into the hospital. And while some of Kettering's professors are working well into retirement, the quarterly Kettering plague they face has likely exercised their immune systems thoroughly.\n\nAt the end of the day, getting sick sucks ass, but it most likely won't hurt you more than the flu would. Avoid it if you can ^(not saying that covering your face is or is not effective, that's a personal decision in my book)\n\nEdit: Not sure why the downvotes? Choose your battles I guess.",

Humidity is very low which causes sinus irritation which makes it easier to get sick. Most people stay indoors as well, leading to more interaction with people. There's also a reduction in physical activity for most people which can also cause a decline in immune system health. And topping it off with reduced UV exposure.\n\nSome individuals can't be vaccinated which leads to herd immunity requirements (part 22: electric kazoo does a good job at bypassing vaccines).\n\nFearmongering. Everyone is super freaked out still. I'm personally over it, and was over it after some information was made available. But, everyone has their opinions. I had friends freaking out when I didn't get tested again, despite waiting symptoms out + 3 days. If I had the flu, they wouldn't have cared at all from the start.\n\nI'm over it and want to get back to normal, but the powers that be are not ready for that. They're in a lose-lose situation - appease those that want to move on, or appease those that would tip off news organizations that we're \"killing people.\"",

We are currently online, therefore self-management of your health is possible. In-person would be mandatory, therefore Kettering would have to have a hand in student health management.\n\nKettering would have to require testing (with mandatory reporting) from everyone if they wanted to make an informed decision on going back in-person. It would be rather intrusive of the administration to do it, however it's the only option available to them. Whether or not the information is useful is another question as well - I personally got covid and tested negative 3 times via antigen testing (all different manufacturers and making sure I got good samples) and only received the positive from a PCR test. Kettering's testing resource is doing on-site antigen testing, which would be fine if they were more effective.",

The PCR can come up positive up to 3 months after you've been infected, but the antigen detects if you have a high viral load, which is associated with transmission. It's just overkill especially if you're vaccinated, since the vaccine shortens the period of time you'd have a high viral load.",

Classes realistically should stay completely online, especially considering the increase in cases... but if kids are going to cry about not having in person learning then allow hybrid and let those students go in person.",

Adapting things to be online doesn't seem to be nearly as difficult than it is to manage an in-person class AND an online class at the same time - even if it is the same material simultaneously. u/jkhuggins can provide more insight.\n\nEither way, the intension was to hold classes in person for the term and students would've already had to make their arrangements to live on/near campus. It's not like students would've been able to be refunded on housing for a messed up term (in the vast majority of cases) due to contracts, so it would've been advantageous for students to stay in the housing they're already required to pay for. Not only because of the monetary aspect, but because of campus resources still being available.",

For me, at least, hybrid was the worst of both worlds, as I was trying to teach for two separate audiences at the same time.   I ended up treating it like \"virtual teaching with a studio audience\", because that's what felt right.   But I have no real sense as to what other faculty feel about the \"virtual v. hybrid\" debate.   \n\n(Of course, what we did in Summer/Fall was actually none of those three options, which makes it hard to evaluate where to go next.)\n\nAnd, of course, none of that has anything to do with the state of the pandemic.  Obviously, we'd all love to be back on campus with no restrictions of any form.   I'd also love to drive a Cadillac and look like Sean Connery, but that ain't gonna happen, either.",

I was completely ready for in-person but starting off the term all online and then switching right before midterms does not make any sense. They should stay online and then next term go back to in-person.   \n\n\nAs for housing, that is definitely not majority cases, plenty of students along with me would prefer to save all the money they can by staying at home if classes are online.",

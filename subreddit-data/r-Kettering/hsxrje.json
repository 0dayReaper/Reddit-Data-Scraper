He makes the material super easy to understand and when he says the homework will prepare you for the quizzes, he isnt lying. In the end he says you can go to him in the future for help, so dont be too disappointed! I know the situation sucks, but taking a class with him during this time is better than having a prof who's giving more stress lol",

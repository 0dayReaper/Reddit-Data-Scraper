    "postText": "I've been wondering what is a good way to get a social life. I know that sounds lame but hear me out.\n\nI was one of the unlucky few to have come into Kettering as soon as Covid hit so I only recently just started to go to campus. (I decided it was financially best to not stay on campus my first year). So this means that I've missed all of the rush events, I haven't really been able to meet a whole lot of people due to majority of my classes being online, and I don't really know about a lot of the events going on at campus.\n\nI know in the title that I mention outside of greek life but what I mean by that really is that I don't really know if I want to join a house. But I would not mind going to events and what not hosted by them.\n\nOn top of that I have been trying to find out more about clubs but I don't really know where to start there so if anyone has any advice or comments it would be very appreciated!",

However I can only speak on behalf of a few of the houses. You do not have to be interested in Greek life to go, however you will likely be rushed, though it is important to have an open mind since KU Greek life is significantly different from other schools. Clubs are a great way to get to know people, and typically are a lot of fun. Apply for KSG senate or ops, that is also a good way to put yourself out there and meet new people. It honestly comes down to you though, say hi and talk to your classmates and get their social media's. If you're going to be living in off campus non CV housing find a few buddies and split a house with them. Just put yourself out there!",

During the summer all the fraternities will be posting on social media and on campus about events you can go to to get to know them better and experience for yourself. In the winter is when those that rushed in the summer get initiated. Fraternities can still hand out bids in the winter, and often will. But since rushing is not the main focus(initiation is) they may not be hosting rush events, but they will still host parties. I would say you have two options, DM some fraternities on Instagram, say you'd like a tour or have questions, they would happily invite you over for dinner or give you a tour any time of the week. That option would easily apply to all fraternities (and sororities), you can also find a member, they would be wearing the letters. Option two would be to go to their parties, if they host them, and find some members and have some fun. Often though they can be very hectic and members may not be able to devote time to get to know you but don't let that turn you away, parties are work for most members rather than a party lol. If you have any questions I can DM you, I'm actually B section but very fond of A section and can answer unbiased. :)",

If you are at all interested in sports, get involved with the Rec Center. Try playing IM sports, signing up for individual classes, or looking for a job. If you are more interested in gaming, you could try trying out for a Kettering Esports team.\n\nIf you want to be active in student life, literally walk in to the student life office and ask. Kyle could tell you about Compass, Unit Buddies, KSG / Student government, or The planning committe (that plans stuff like late night breakfast.)\n\nClubs at Kettering can be hit or miss, but you can always find information at My Kettering.",

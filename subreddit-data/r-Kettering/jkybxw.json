Given the current state of Covid in the state and Kettering's apparent inability to handle it, why is returning to in-person classes even on the table?",

I had to go to the university for mandatory testing, but other than that I was instructed to stay off campus if possible, and my safe return to campus portal was red without me even having to fill anything out.  4 business days later I got a private message in kettering's wellness portal thingy (I don't recall exactly what it was but I got an email telling me I had a private message waiting) from the nurse and it said I was negative and could return to campus.\n\nAlso, you can check Kettering's Covid response page and look for the results of the day you got tested to be posted.  Mine were up within 2 days of me recieving the private message.\n\nKettering case reports:\nhttps://www.kettering.edu/covid-19/case-reports\n\nAlso, if you got exposed and are awaiting to return to campus, check the safe return to campus form daily.  If it says you're able to go to the campus, that also means your test came back negative.",

So it is not a Kettering thing that they don't tell you your results. If you get a test anywhere, and hear nothing after 2-3 days, you are negative",

Some of my friends told me that they were sick but no one really helped them out from the professors end, so I wanted to know what else is possible if that happens. I rarely get sick as much to not attend classes but rn I owe it to my fellow classmates that I don't attend even if I feel like I can power through. \n\nAs for ta's, I was thinking that we usually have SI's anyways, so why not combine that position, yknow?",

All this, plus the fact that some facilities are going back to phase 2 in my county just makes me assume with the colder weather the situation will be worse (which makes sense since virus thrive in the colder weather) \n\nI just don't want the repeat of how professors and students alike were running around trying to not lose limited teaching time because we didn't really know if we should be staying home or coming to class or what will happen \n\n\nI apologize for the long rant",

    "postText": "Hi guys I was wondering if anyone else feels that Kettering puts a lot of pressure on us to succeed, not only at school but at our co-ops as well? Has anyone found a way to cope with this besides crying and breaking down about wanting to transfer?  It might just be me and my fear of failure at kettering, but it\u2019s getting to the point now where i don\u2019t know if i\u2019m even learning anything because i\u2019m so focused on trying to pass the class. I had to cheat in my CS class last fall, and if i didn\u2019t I would have failed and found myself taking another term ( costs more money which i don\u2019t have). Does anyone have any tips or tricks on how to deal with the pressure or am i just fucked??",

I used to worry all the time about failing and after a while, I could tell that it was really making me perform worse than I should. Just put in the effort and the grades will follow. You got this :)",

            "comment": "Yeah. Kettering pressure is no joke. Not for the faint of heart.\n\nMake sure you get plenty of sleep, even when you feel like you should be studying.\n\nTwo tips from me:\n\nIf you are getting over a b+ in a class spend less time in that class and more in the ones with lower grades.\n\nMake sure you truly understand the subject. To do this I recommend finding 3 different sources to learn from and compare. One should be the teacher, the other should be the book and the last you should find on your own. I usually found someone on YouTube but am not past paying $14.99 for some online lectures.\n\nSometimes if the teacher sucks you gotta find 2 alternate sources.\n\nTake notes on differences in equations and try and find why they are different.\n\nFeel free to dm me if you need any more help.",

As far as classes go, don't be afraid to visit the ASC or your professors' office hours - they exist for a reason ;)\n\nDefinitely try to form study groups in your classes as well, with campus being in-person, it should be easier to find some people you'd be comfortable working with.\n\nHang in there, it is a stressful school, just like all of the others that you could attend. But, if you're kind to your own sanity, you'll be okay.",

            "comment": "Definitely agree with what others have been saying. Kettering is definitely tough. Condensing six months of classes into three has its cons. But, imo, is made up by the co-op time you gain. I would say I've learned more applicable knowledge in my co-op than in any class. If there was one reason to continue at Kettering, it'd be that. That being said, it certainly doesn't make 11 weeks of hell any easier.  But hopefully, it helps to give you some motivation as to why to keep going. I'm a Senior 2 double major (ME/EE) doing 20 credits each term. The prospect/worth of my accumulated experience and resume after leaving Kettering, along with knowing I won't be here as long doing 20 credits each term, is what helps me not jump off a bridge somedays. \n\nAs for in the moment, I've gotten myself in a mindset of doing homework in the breaks between classes and as soon as I get home. Not only that, I try do the hardest thing first. Sounds kinda counterintuitive, but I've realized that my future self is much more grateful, and less stressed, that he only has to tidy things up or add a couple of sentences rather than write the entire essay. Chipping away at things hardest to easiest, even if I don't complete the whole thing that day, as soon as possible helps me manage the stress of a huge to-do list. On the topic of to-do lists, I try to only put one week at a time on mine. Even if profs have a calendar of all assignments and due dates, if I put all that on my to-do list at once, I'd immediately have a panic attack.\n\nI'll say a couple things about cheating and the stress associated with it. Whats your definition of cheating? Did you copy off someones answers, or did you use a solution manual to help with your homework? For the former, that's a risk vs. reward calculation you'll have to do yourself. But, imo, isn't worth it. As for the latter, this is where I've ended up. Homework is meant for you to learn. As much as people think they can learn by watching and listening, true learning requires doing. That's the whole idea of the co-op experience after all. That being said, some (a lot) of professors have a distorted view of how much time students have outside of their class and also think they're the only class that exists. If you truly dedicated the amount of time professors expect to each assignment, I'd imagine you'd have a very hard time. Even more so if you're struggling to understand something and it slows down your whole flow, delaying other assignments, and adding more to your stress. Maybe this is where you're at. To combat this, I've found you kind of have to balance playing the game that is the educational system and knowing what to learn. I know I have to get the assignment turned in to keep my grade up, continue at Kettering and my co-op, and ultimately graduate. I also know that I need to actually know the course material to pass exams. But, there's also a lot of redundant information I don't need to keep or practice. So, when it comes to homework, I'll usually approach it like this. Do a question or two on my own. Ask myself where I struggled and mentally note it. Work through the rest of the assignment with the solution manual, again making note of anything I'm struggling with. Now that the assignment is done, I can turn it in, I know what I really need to study, and I can study it until I truly understand it, without the stress of due dates piling up on me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuge wall of text, but hopefully it helps to give you some insight.\n\n**Tl;dr**: Kettering is stressful, but co-op makes it worth it. Chipping away at assignments, hardest to easiest, and not putting too much on your to-do list can help you psychologically manage homework. And sometimes you just gotta play the game and study in the time, and stress, you save by playing",

            "comment": "Kettering is definitely tough, but eventually everyone figures out their own coping strategies. You just need to find yours.\n\nHere's what's worked for me thus far, maybe some will help you:  \n\\*Forming a study group of students who also want to \\[honestly\\] do well in their classes (use ASC resources, too, but a study group will take you farther since the ASC doesn't really cover upper level classes). I found mine by watching who was taking good notes/paying attention, but wasn't Greek.\n\n\\*Taking breaks (especially going outside for a walk...even if the weather isn't the best, the fresh air and movement helps).\n\n\\*Talking to the profs of my tough classes. Most are very willing to help after class or in their office hours, as long as you put forth a little effort/communication. Office hours aren't usually that busy...I literally had one prof spend an entire hour slowly walking me though a concept until I got it.\n\n\\*Setting aside a 'mope day'. Idk what else to call it, but this is the one day every term that I don't do any homework, let the self pity take over, eat ice cream and binge watch a tv show. Sounds stupid, but it works wonders.",

The people who actively have covid cannot come to campus and also will not be accommodated for their class putting them two weeks behind which is 20% of the course\n2. It would stop the potential for spread with more people online and people being further apart\nThey are effectively saying \u201cyou\u2019re screwed even though you paid tuition which is absolutely egregious in my opinion",

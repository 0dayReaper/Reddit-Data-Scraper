My son said that they all tested on Friday (2 of the positive cases did not show symptoms till today) and the calls started coming in yesterday and today with who was positive.  Kettering moved to all virtual classes at the beginning of the week and Phi Delta's have NOT left the house (unless it was for testing) or went anywhere in the last 5-7 days (as 1 member started to show symptoms) they are and will stay quarantined until every member tests negative. This has been my son's 3rd test in the last 7 days (he's still waiting on his results from Friday the 2 previous tests were negative) however,  he drove one of the brothers to test last Friday and he found out today that he is positive. So more than likely my son is or will be testing positive in the near future. So far all positive brothers are showing onset flu like signs: no energy,  congested,  muscle aches and headaches.\u201d",

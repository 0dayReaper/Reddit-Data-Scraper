We aren't even in the worst of the pandemic yet (according to many sources). \n\nI need a new co-op and might have lost my thesis project at my old one (Senior 1 btw)\n\nKettering needs to support all of it's parts. I need to make money and get my degree. Freshman btw. Fraternities btw. Also lets not give everyone COVID at our school.",

There's a reason that we as students feel like KU admin puts profits over the KU experience, and it's not that we're lazy or entitled or don't understand how to run a business. Until KU makes a visible effort to make tangible, significant changes that address the concerns of the majority of students (not just a loud minority) were gonna keep bitching, moaning, and sharing memes.\n\nYes, there are individuals and groups at KU that go above and beyond to improve our experiences as students, but it's not coming from the top. In fact, its often inaction or resistance from the 'top' that makes those individuals and groups have to work so hard to make things better. Not to mention all the covering up that goes on so students won't get to find out how they're being screwed over. Yet, they get mad at their paying customers for not being enthusiastic about attracting more customers. Yeah, try again Kettering. Maybe another $10K hike in tuition will do it this time.\n\nYou want our unyielding support? You gotta earn it. Not a business major, but imo customer satisfaction is just as important; as a factor of PR; as advertising, If not more. Re-allocate that budget to the students where it belongs. Just my two cents.\n\nFeel free to correct me or jump in with your opinion, I'd be happy to discuss this. I probably know less than I think I do.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, as you have likely seen or noticed my old account in the past I wanted to let you know my old account (u/anotherKUthowaway) has been permanently suspended by Reddit. The reason given was \"violation of Terms of Service\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to appeal the suspension but lost and now all my previous accounts are now lost to the Reddit admins as will this account be surely suspended too within 24 hours. If you would like to reach out to me feel free to join the r/Kettering discord ([https://discord.gg/58kVMdB7](https://discord.gg/58kVMdB7)) I will try to watch out for any questions or comments and will remain active there in the meantime. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been an honor serving as one of your meme lords the past year and a half and I wish this subreddit the best moving forward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-aKUt",

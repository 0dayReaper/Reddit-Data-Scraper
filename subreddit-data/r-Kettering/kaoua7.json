    "postText": "A possible way to actually prevent honor lock from becoming a reality and accessing our data: through our co-ops. After talking to my a-section counterpart at my co-op we discovered that several students have access to the company\u2019s network on their personal laptops. We are working to get our co-op to speak out against honor lock to the university. If you also have access to your co-op\u2019s network from your personal laptop please make your co-op aware of honor lock and try to convince them to reach out to Kettering about it.",

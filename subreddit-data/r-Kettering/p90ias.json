The EE department has already basically said they won't do anything because reasons.\n\nKettering administrators, please do your due diligence when considering new professors. They must be able to teach a class, not just be able to slap images on a 60 slide presentation.\n\nUpdate: She refuses to accommodate for COVID positive students\n\nUpdate 2: Thank you stranger for the platinum :)",

            "comment": "I really tried to learn what I could from her but it's almost no use. Flies through slides way too quickly. Not enough explanation and/or examples. Quizzes and tests are ridiculous and hardly resemble what we do in class. Just a personal opinion, but I hate multiple choice when the tests require so much math. It makes it harder to identify what im doing wrong. I don't even get to know what I'm doing wrong because we're not allowed to see our quizzes afterwards.  How can I improve If I don't know what to improve on. Baby circuits and Circuits 1 are the same class at the moment. So many problems.\n\nUpdate: I have been made aware from ASC that quote \"The department head is aware of the concerns surrounding this professor and it is a continuing work in progress, I hope everyone sees changes quickly\"",

Every moment of that class was spent hating it. \ud83d\ude05 I haven't had really any programming experience outside that course and I'm sure that didn't help, but it was just an awful experience. It was all online and impossible to pay attention to her.\n\n(1) Nearly everything was her just reading off PowerPoint slides for an hour, most of which I don't believe were her own, and then setting us off to do some very unhelpful examples and often being of no help when questions were asked. Maybe her teaching style just didn't click with me but by God, I didn't actually absorb any sort of information or learn anything from her. \n\n(2) There were times she released quizzes or assignments due at the end of class online and then kept talking and asking if we were working on it. Sometimes I got it. But other times I had to mute her because I couldn't focus.\n\n(3) I'm pretty sure most of our exam, at least the first one, consisted of questions from the internet. At least ones that existed long before her testing us.\n\n(4) I realize I had and really have no experience in this realm of things, but the student who was partnered with me for quizzes (bless his heart for his patience with me) at times didn't even understand why she did things the way she did, why she wanted them that way, etc. \n\n(5) 96 was an A and that makes me very annoyed for how grossly incompetent she felt. \n\nMaybe I just didn't get her teaching style, maybe this type of thing just doesn't stick in my head. But I learned far better and even did better in Orgo 1 than I did with her (aka I struggled hard with orgo but id take that over her any day). It was just frustrating. For awhile I thought it was just me but doesn't seem like it now.",

    "postText": "Even though countless co-ops have been lost and many freshman have even dropped out, you know who to support. Yeah, this whole thing was preventable, but us maga folks gotta stick together. Of course I\u2019ll still be voting for Trump since I have my co-op and thanks to his Covid action I get to stay at home and only work for 2 hours a day. Plus I can apply for the Kettering Emergency Fund as well since it\u2019s open to all students, hopefully no one really needs it. But be sure to go online and register so we can KEEP AMERICA GREAT, things really aren\u2019t that bad online so man up and deal with it.\n\nEdit: /s lol",

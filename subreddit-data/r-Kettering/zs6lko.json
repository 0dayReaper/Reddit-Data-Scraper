I am not disagreeing with that. \n\n\u201cThe University is on holiday break starting 5:00 p.m. December 16th, 2022 through January 2, 2023.\u201d\n\nI am however annoyed General D is sending stupid texts about being here for us over the holiday. It\u2019s hard to be there for student when you have your OoO set General D\ud83e\udd2c.\n\nRegards,\n\nKettering Students who are sick of the automated text messages.",

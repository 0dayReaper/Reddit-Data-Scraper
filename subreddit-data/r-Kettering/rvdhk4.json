Looking for something like a rubric, can anyone help me out here? \n\n It's a co-op thesis, and I've already completed deliverables on the co-op side, I'm currently at my last work week before going back and am doing validation/review just to make sure it works precisely as described when I submitted my topic approval last summer.",

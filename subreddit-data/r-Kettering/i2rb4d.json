Should I switch degrees? Should I transfer out? Should I stick to it? I\u2019m tweaking a little bit here ngl, any input is appreciated",

So don't feel like your locked into your major.\n\nJust keep looking and you'll find an EE job, and honestly for a lot of companies they don't care what major you have since you have little experience or no formal education anyways. I did mechanical work as a Computer Engineer for my co-op. You could potentially have an easier time finding a job by just going as undecided for your major instead of EE for your first year, although i don't know if they let you do that or not anymore.",

Its not like knowing what I had learn for the job was harmful or useless.",

I started one place and absolutely hated it, quit after my first term, then had six interviews and four offers on the table that I got to choose from. It\u2019s a hell of a lot easier to find a co-op job once you have a little bit of experience. \n\nAlso, I\u2019d stick with EE at least until you get through Fields/Circuits 1 just to see if you like it.

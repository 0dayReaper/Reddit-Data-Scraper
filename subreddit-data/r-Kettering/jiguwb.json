            "comment": "just curious was the @ the greek community the same question?\n\nalso I just realized you were asking A-section for responses on the next terms format.\n\n as someone who was on campus this B-section term and entirely online I think it would be nice if they wouldnt sell what we're currently doing as a hybrid option its more 75%+ online into 100% online after thanksgiving. It feels like there was a big push to have incoming freshmen being on campus for their first term either for getting them to have a \"kettering experience\" or to expose them to clubs and greek life on campus but I feel like with how locked down everyone was having a more central online space would have worked better. And yes I understand the need for safety and not wanting to spread covid on campus, it just feels like 75% of the experience could still be had if we moved to online without the stress of everyone moving out of the dorms or worrying about being locked down in their dorm rooms when something like this happened. The added stress for students has probably made this a worse option with how this B-section term has gone. Just my thoughts on the matter, I'm glad I got to spend time with my friends again after 9 months of being isolated to my room at home.\n\nIf A-section thinks differently I think it would be a good idea to go with what they think I just don't see the benefit of in person with how many people are moving home with the current hybrid setup.",

The university never fails to surprise me on their ridiculous approach of handling COVID. it's like someone on the board goes home and asks their kid what do think we should do. They went virtual because of rising cases but now that we're back, students don't have to wear masks - make that make sense \ud83e\udd14",

My concern arises from the fact that if masks aren't necessary then why did we go virtual in the first place? Obviously the situation isn't completely alright or else we wouldn't go virtual. And if we went virtual, that's an extreme approach, so then coming back you'd think the smart thing would be to have masks. I guess can't really explain my point well through text",

A lot of professors I have had in the past have been very reasonable about masking in class, some didn't care.\n\nDeepali will definitely require her classes to wear masks, she spent more time lecturing her classes summer term on mask wearing than on the actual curriculum!\n\nAdministration is giving professors the power to require masks in class. Those that believe they are important will require them, some may ask how the class feels because they are personally indifferent.",

A mask isn\u2019t going to kill anyone and it\u2019s not that hard to do, I have to wear a mask at work everyday. The higher ups should make the call so professors that care have the support from the school when students try to be dicks about the policy",

Profs are definitely the better bet if you think coming to school puts you at risk and want to stay virtual, but there were literally kids who were given a hard time when they had covid and actually reported it, and it was just ridiculous\n\nI think if you send the school a note with certain things from the doctor, they might excuse you. But who knows? They definitely don't care\n\nAlso, I'm sorry on behalf of students who don't wear masks when it was mandated. Students like yourself who are at risk don't deserve that. We should all at least try to do our best for our fellow students",

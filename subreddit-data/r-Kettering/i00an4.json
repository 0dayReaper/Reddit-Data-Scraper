    "postText": "I fucking hate it at this god damn shithole.\n\nI've tried to make some friends here, but I swear to god every single person is a fucking introverted asshole who doesn't give a shit about anything. Every single person I've had a lab with is a complete retard, and that's the only option left after I ask everyone else to be my partner, who conveniently have their own partners already.\n\nThe Co-op management is complete shit, since im a BIOCHEM major, that means approximately 0 companies are ever interested in my and it seems like I'm being left out from what other people are saying, leaving me to not give a shit. I feel like I'm wasting all this money just sitting around doing nothing while everyone around me is living in their youth and their lives.\n\nCollege is, once again, just another piece of shit piled onto my life just like high school, which I wasted always thinking college would be better, what a fucking letdown. I wasted my entire freshman year just staying in my room doing nothing because I have no idea what anyone else is doing, also fuck being an introvert wasting my life jacking off. \n\nI have 0 friends, spend all day in my room, don't know how to approach people without them thinking I want to fucking murder and rape them for some god damn reason, and I know that's what they think. And whenever I do ask anyone to hang out, they're ALWAYS already busy with some menial shit conveniently at the same time, so the social setting here is fuck.\n\nAll in all, fuck this school, fuck the students, and if you know you're one of these people, then fuck you.",

There are all kinds of clubs/opportunities to meet people.\n\nIf you like sports, there's all kinds of intramurals (probably more when we're past covid).  There's clubs for everything too, just have to make yourself available to be a part of things.\n\nCollege is always what you make of it.  Yeah, sometimes it's not fun, that happens.  It always has its moments.\n\nEsports is a thing now too, come hang out with us in the Esports Discord, it's a way to meet other students, talk about all kinds of games, and just a place to hang out while we're dealing with the pandemic.\n\nSometimes things aren't fun.  Unfortunately life can be that way.  Just gotta try and take that and make something good out of it.",

Not everything is always handed to you on a silver platter. Sometimes you have obstacles and challenges to overcome - welcome to the real world. It's 10% situation and 90% adaptation.\n\nHonestly, I understand being frustrated at times and making complaints on Reddit, but this post is quite uncalled for. If you really don't like Kettering that much you're certainly more than welcome to transfer - the campus is much better when it's full of people that actually want to be here and become Kettering Built.",

    "postText": "u/anotherKUthrowaway\n\n[Address Redacted]\n\nDecember 23, 2019\n\n\nPresident Robert McMahan\n\nKettering University\n\n1700 University Ave\n\nFlint, MI 48504\n\nDear Mr. McMahan:\n\nFirst, I would like to address the moderators of this site. I would like to thank you all for your work and the time involved in watching and staying up to date with a fast paced student body. I would also like to commend your ability to adhere to the university\u2019s policies while still protecting my, and countless others, free speech. You could easily choose to work directly with the university to only allow the posts the school would allow. This would violate our rights and again I thank you for your work.\n\nSecondly, I would like to address the alumni of Kettering University and GMI. You have graduated and achieved a feat all the active students hope to one day accomplish. You have suffered through the professors, homework, 20 credit terms, thesis, and still managed to earn a diploma. For that I commend you. I know the experiences you have lived on campus likely vary from my own and I in no way mean to belittle you and your academic careers.\n\nThird, I would like to address the faculty and staff directly. Your roll and purpose for your employment is to help aid the raising and production of young successful students. I would like to congratulate you on your countless degrees, awards, and acclimations you have earned throughout your careers. Your goals as faculty, teachers, and professors should be to, at the best of your ability, transfer your knowledges and experiences to your students in the most effective and simple way possible. If you would please now reflect on the last interaction you had with a student. Reflect back and ask yourself the following questions:\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did the last interaction I had go well?\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From the views of the student how would they have perceived the interaction?\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Had my superior been present for the interaction, would they approve?\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did the interaction result in a deeper knowledge of a subject with the student?\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Was my presentation of knowledge simple and effective in teaching the student?\n\nI could go on but I will let you now instead focus on the present problems at hand. I am sure many of you are aware, or are now aware, of this subreddit. If your name, or class, has come up in any of the memes posted, congratulations you have likely not done your job as an educator to the fullest. Student\u2019s complaints of teachers with no teaching ability have ruined the reputation of entire departments. If the University and Board of Education will not review you, then perhaps you review yourselves and make the commitment to improve, or simply leave. Your decrepit teaching styles will not be missed.\n\nTo the staff working in the Co-op department. Frankly, your actions and advice given to students do not reflect how life is in the real world. If I have a Co-op position that I am not happy with I should be able to start the process of finding a new job while still employed (I am sure some, if not many, of you found your current position while actively employed elsewhere). Co-op managers are supposed to help students be placed in jobs they want to have and will benefit them long term. If a student is not happy with their position, you tell them it\u2019s best not the change co-ops at all but at least complete two rotations before deciding if you will be leaving that position. Upon a decision to leave, you will not allow a student to actively search for a new position prior to them informing their job they will not be returning. I know students who were let go, downsized, laid off, and fired. It\u2019s the real world and it\u2019s an unfortunate reality. What I find most shocking is how painful it is for these students to find new positions on short notice. Co-ops rarely staff up for terms when they are starting but often months ahead. Your roll should be to talk to companies and guide students to find employment to continue to earn credits towards their degree, not just give them a link to Kettering Connect. \n\nNow I would like to address McMahan and the Board of Education. The defined role of the president of a university is to be responsible for the organization and administration of the university and to act as a liaison between the students and the Board of Education. In order to fulfill your role to this university you must listen to and interact directly with students, and consider their opinions and concerns in regard to the policies and actions you create and present to the board. You must then defend your proposals and students concerns if and when the board opposes you. We, as a student body have tried to raise concerns with you about an abundance of issues through all the common and accepted methods. We answered your surveys, attended and asked questions at your town halls, answered more surveys, filled out teacher and course evaluations, and again answered more surveys. Surely that amount of data (because face it, receiving data from an online survey is not an \u201cinteraction\u201d) would result in you knowing what the students want to see change? Perhaps you noticed, or were told, answers the computer deemed \u2018too emotional\u2019 were discarded. We put our opinions out there for you, but you never received them. Some of our opinions were minor (Think, \u201cWhy are tacos always on Wednesday and not Tuesday?\u201d) and some dealt with major concerns affecting the greater student body.\n\nStudents\u2019 tuition pay your salary McMahan. Our tuition always pays for all the events planned and changes to the technology and buildings that hold them. I cannot attest to a desire for solar trees or three month construction projects to re-glue tiling, but I know for a fact I want bathrooms that are not closed for entire terms, ceilings that don\u2019t leak, and central heat and air that are less temperamental than the students in the buildings. I, as do many others, feel as if our opinions are not being heard, or worse they are ignored. With this present generation, especially with how gifted the students you are to care for are, we refuse to be pushed around. We are future leaders who are watching out for each other and want you to know that the more you ignore our requests, the louder we will be. Memes posted on the internet was not our primary way of raising issues to you, but it seems to have gotten your attention \u00a0being in the public eye like that (I was at the summer term town hall meeting when you told us to stop and that administration would be keeping the subreddit in check). As with most university presidents, you want a positive image portrayed to the public of the institution you run. You can pay tour guides and tell them to lie (I have friends who do tours and have been trained to do exactly that) but with the student body posting the truth of the state of the university to where anyone can find it, you worry. So I ask, want the memes to stop? Fix what we make fun of. Its time you use students tuition dollars for what they want to see in our campus, not to give yourself an absurd raise for seemingly no reason. I would go on about how you have failed me, and the entire student body, as the President of Kettering University but I am one voice to ignore.\n\nFinally, I would like to directly address the students who are also reading this open letter. Each and every one of you has a right to be able to make your voices heard. I call upon you to at least comment your questions and/or concerns below for future readers. I call upon you to write emails and letters (hell tweet McMahan if you want) to voice your opinions on what you want to see change in our university. As paying customers of this institution we deserve to have a form of say in how our money is spent.\n\nYour move McMahan,\n\n\nu/anotherKUthrowaway\n\n\n\nP.s. I expect to be hearing back from you in the form of a publicly sent email to the student body addressing my, and others, concerns with a \u2018what, how, when\u2019 overviewing the issue, the decided upon action, and when the action will occur for the most commonly reoccurring concerns",

            "comment": "I've read your letter and agree with a lot of points, but I don't think that mcmahan is doing as bad of a job as many students make it seem like. One thing I've notice over my years at Kettering is that Kettering students love to complain, but when offered a solution they'll dismiss it and continue complaining instead, they don't want to take up the work to actually fix something even if that's something as simple as giving feedback. We all bitch and whine to each other about Kettering being a terrible place, but nobody seems to follow it up by talking to the school or actively working to be a part of the change in environment. This doesn't mean nobody has complained but it's slow and never really goes through when people try to do so.\n\nI would love to see more people actively seeking to make complaints known like this rather than sitting idly by because they think nothing ever happens when you complain about stuff and don't follow up with an email or conversation with McMahan on the subject. At the town hall he said he has office hours to make himself available to the student body, I've never been so I don't know how true that is but if he does, u would encourage students to email or just walk in to talk to McMahan about their complaints as each of them are a member of the students body. Everyone is welcome to do this even people that have varying views from many people on campus that might feel outspoken, just understand that 1 person's views do not reflect that of the entire student body and drastic actions require a significant portion of the student body to have changes made.",

Please note that while I do not disagree with your main argument, there are several things you use for support that are simply inaccurate.\n\n* A lot of the concerns that students raise at things like Dr. McMahan's Town Halls stem from misunderstandings that arise from half-baked knowledge of what's actually going on at the University in the \"behind-the-scenes\" area.  While such events are good places to get information, they aren't the place to raise concerns because the majority of the time spent at that event is spent dispelling disinformation and rumors.\n* Student tuition does not even come remotely close to paying for the things you seem to think it does, and it isn't involved at all in some of the things you've mentioned.\n   * The solar trees?  Funded by a donation that was given to the University on the condition that it be spent on those objects.  The trees themselves?  Never intended to be optimized placement of solar panels, because they're sculptures - they're works of art that also happen to provide some functionality.\n   * \"Re-gluing tiles\"?  The Gauntlet is a truly fascinating piece of engineering.  I'm not sure how much you've thought about what it is that's underneath that tile, but that's not a floor you're walking on - it's a roof.  It's the roof over a large section of BJ's, as well as a significant portion of the tunnel that connects Thompson Hall to the CC.  A roof that had reached the end of its service life and needed to be replaced - so that's exactly what the University is doing: replacing it.  Because of the way it was built, in addition to how important it is that the repairs be done correctly - in spite of the fact that this little season called Winter tends to delay any construction project undertaken during those months, that process is slow.\n   * \"Ceilings that don't leak\" is a much more complicated problem that you might think.  Where the water is entering the roof and where it's coming out of the ceiling are often hundreds of feet apart, and while you and I both would much rather the ceiling doesn't leak, I'm sure you'd agree that you'd rather the building be open for classes than completely shut down while we dig through an old ceiling, full of pipes; wires; and, let's face it, probably asbestos.\n   * The mention of temperamental heating and cooling makes me wonder whether you're referring to Thompson Hall (a building that was constructed to be a nuclear fallout shelter and is thus impossible to put WiFi in without tearing out walls to install an access point in every room - something that just makes no sense to do given that the building itself will be torn down in a few years, which is also why they won't bother to implement a large-scale fix to the HVAC there) or the AB during B-Section.  Since my parenthetical spoke to TH, I'll now point out that the HVAC system in the AB is old.  It's simply impossible to run the AC and the heat at the same time, which makes for a great time during seasons of large-scale temperature fluctuations over a short period of time.  As to parts of the building existing at different temperatures, that's another side-effect of the age of the building, as well as the fact that different parts of it were constructed at different times, and thus employ different kinds of insulation.\n* In the many interactions I've had with Dr. McMahan (including, but not limited to, the times I've delivered him his paper, had breakfast with him, or chatted with whim while setting up the sound equipment in his backyard for the Senior BBQ), not once have I ever got the impression that he isn't taking me seriously - he's taken out his phone to take notes on what we're discussing many times, even asking me to repeat some things so he can get it all down.  The man is incredibly busy, which is a double-edged sword: it means that he'll do everything he can to address concerns that he hears, but it also means that he isn't always the best person to voice those concerns to.",

The things that I specifically agree with you on are as follows:\n\n\\- The moderators have done a phenomenal job balancing the policies of both KU and Reddit with the task of allowing us to vent our frustrations in an environment that can sometimes be as vitriolic as 4chan.\n\n\\- Alumni have experience that we lack, but we also have experience that they lack - anyone trying to belittle the things the others are saying shows very little appreciation for the fact that life experiences differ between eras.\n\n\\- The role of faculty is to impart knowledge on students and prepare us for the working world.  Sometimes, in the working world, you'll have to deal with people who phone-in lectures, are openly chauvinistic to the point of referring a person by the word \"female\" rather than by her name, or are hopelessly incompetent.  In that way, and in that way only, do some professors prepare us for the future.  However, as their job is firstly to impart knowledge, such professors would do better to seek other professions.\n\n \\- Word of advice:  If you want to coach your students to success more than you want to teach them to be successful, go be a motivational speaker.  And while you're at it, take that enormous wooden cross and put it INSIDE your shirt - and don't take that as an attack on your religion, because that's where my necklace (a Jerusalem Cross from my Kairos retreat) resides: inside my shirt, where it isn't being thrown in anyone's face.\n\n \\- Word of advice:  If you want to spend more time talking about how great your industry job was and how cool gears are than you do actually lecturing, go back to your industry job working with gears.  And while you're at it, her name is Kaitlin.   Also, I'm not paying to join some society of engineers who work with gears just to earn a pitiful amount of extra credit if, when I asked you to explain a concept that showed up in our homework that you never bothered to bring up in class, you asked me if I knew what Google was.  I'm just not going to do that.\n\n \\- Word of advice:  If you're going to be a self-righteous tool about how woke you are at every opportunity, go find a job at a university full of liberal arts majors who will agree with you.  And while you're at it, maybe don't tell me that I \"don't understand how corporate America works\" when you haven't had a job in corporate America before or since you worked part-time at McDonald's when you were 18 and I've been working in corporate America for five years?\n\n\\- I haven't seen hide nor hair of my Co-Op coordinator since my first term here.  No emails, no calls, just the occasional 'hello' if I bump into her in the halls.  Oh, and I've been unemployed for two years because Co-Ops don't want to hire seniors who already have a thesis project.\n\n\\- I've filled out countless surveys in my time here, and I have not once seen any action taken that follows up on any of them, except that one time BJ's changed their menu to keep a popular item.\n\n\\- It's the sad truth that those in power rarely care to listen to complaints until the volume of the complaints starts to make them look bad.\n\n\\- If any other students have concerns and would like to share them, please send them to the Technician.  We may be putting together a compilation of common complaints to attach to this open letter if we do publish it.  Emphasis on may.  But hey, shoot them to us anyway - I know where to send them to get maximum visibility from administration, which is something that most students do not.\n\n\\-  \"As paying customers of this institution we deserve to have a form of say in how our money is spent.\"  PREACH.",

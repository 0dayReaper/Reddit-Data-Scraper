    "postText": "I know many people have had the issues of losing their co-ops due to the whole pandemic thing (including myself). I\u2019m considering transferring out of Kettering as it doesn\u2019t seem to be worth it as I don\u2019t see the job market recovering quickly or the pandemic going away quickly. I want to know if anyone else has considered this due to the pandemic and lost co-ops when Kettering\u2019s main thing is having a co-op. Just want to hear other perspectives or if my train of thought is wrong. Transferring just seems like a viable option now",

            "comment": "I came to Kettering right after the major economic downturn in the late 2000's. I wouldn't stress too much about the co-op portion - it'll come back eventually, and the University made adjustments so that students impacted by it could still graduate on time without the usual number of co-op terms.\n\nTBH, just having a few semesters of co-op through Kettering is going to make you more marketable than many other engineering graduates. Every other engineering student is facing similar challenges right now - the engineering school I now work at is seeing many of their students loose their summer internships. Those students may not get those opportunities back whereas I'd be willing to bet you'll get back on track within a year or so and be a step ahead when you graduate.",

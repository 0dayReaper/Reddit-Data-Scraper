    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nKU alumni here, has anyone gone through or is currently going through the accelerated master's program at Kettering?  I am interested in getting an MBA but I would like to know what it is like from those who are either in the program or have knowledge of it. The prospect of getting a master's faster is quite appealing to me but I know that where you get your master's from matters quite a bit to companies which is also another concern of mine with doing it through Kettering.",

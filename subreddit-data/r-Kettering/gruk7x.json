    "postText": "Hypothetically, if the pandemic forces Kettering to stay closed for summer term and the co-op system doesn\u2019t recover by fall term, would kettering be worth it anymore? Tuition is much higher than other universities and without co-op funds it seems hard to argue staying at Kettering  if it isn\u2019t recovering soon. Just a thought",

For me, I have a lot of scholarships that make Kettering affordable, and I am fortunate enough to have kept my co-op so far. Even if my classes are online come July, I won\u2019t be leaving this school.\n\nHowever, if people don\u2019t find themselves in a similar situation, whether the school is too expensive or they\u2019re losing out on their co-op experience, I don\u2019t blame anyone for transferring out. This is a weird time for everyone, and everyone has to do what\u2019s best for them.",

You can get most of the same work experience and the same degree for fractions of the cost and not have to deal with outdated resources arduous schedule to do it. Your connections to the engineering field are it's saving grace and even then it wont be long before other universities eclipse even that.",

    "postText": "Please help the old man update his jokes for the first day of class ...\n\nI have one schtick in my Day 1 lecture where I talk about what does and doesn't count as \"cheating\" in a programming course.   Basically, I say \"You can ask for help, but 'help' doesn't mean directly copying what someone else tells you to do.  You have to understand the help you're being given.\"\n\nA colleague of mine rephrases this as \"Gilligan's Island Rule\".   Basically, you can get as much help as you want, but after the help session is over, you have to go watch an episode of \"Gilligan's Island\".   (The idea is: the help you receive has to reside in long-term memory, not short-term memory.)\n\nOf course, Gilligan's Island is 60 years old now (yikes!).     I tried saying \"Jersey Shore\" for awhile, but even that show is 10 years old now.   What's a better example of a 30-minute piece of entertainment that y'all watch? \n\nMaybe it's a streaming show?  Ted Lasso?  Squid Game?  She-Hulk?  \n\nHelp an old man out, please?",

Binging Netflix is more common, and most episodes are ~40-50 min long.\n\nAre you watching anything these days? It could be a fun connection point to just say \"an episode of &lt;show you're watching&gt; or whatever series you've put on hold\". If you want, you could make like a certain Lit teacher I remember and name-drop an anime.",

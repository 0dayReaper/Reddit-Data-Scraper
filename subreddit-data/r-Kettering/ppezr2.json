Provide accounts of egregious statements and actions that you personally witnessed. Make it crystal clear if you're stating information that you heard second hand.\n\nRemember, she will be provided with the evaluation responses *after* final grades are submitted.\n\nPlease be cordial in all evaluations of all professors. Cussing out a professor through an evaluation carries no weight because it just shows that you're a whiney little bitch. Have some professionalism, be respectful, and look up new words on thesaurus.com if you have to.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nScathing evaluation checklist:\n\n- Respectful language (zero profanity whatsoever)\n- Total honesty in opinions and accounts of egregious actions\n- Necessary contextual Details\n- Reasonable call to action\n- Sincerity",

Just my opinion though. I do agree with you on being professional and everything else. Just not sure if evaluations will matter at this point",

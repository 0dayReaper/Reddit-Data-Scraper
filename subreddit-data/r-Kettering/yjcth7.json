They got robbed regularly, so we we called them the \"Stop and Rob.\" The school forced them out. They also had booze which is what I think pushed the school to do that, and they want you go to the school cafeteria rather than a third party place.\n\nIs Westside Diner still around? Damn... I loved that place back in the day.",

Which wasn't bad, but they aren't always open. That area should be bustling with business... look at downtown Lansing or Ann Arbor around the universities. All sorts of cafes and places to grab a bite in a few minute walk of your classes. I realize that compared to those schools Kettering is tiny, but you'd think there would at least be something better than a not very good bagel shop.\n\nAt least for booze there's also Triangle Mart (I don't think I ever knew the real name of it), and come to think of it there was a taco place that way too, so at least that's something.",

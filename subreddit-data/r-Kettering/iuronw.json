    "postText": "Just a thought, buuut we're facing extra-ordinary events atm. Not good extraordinary events either. Something that was out of the blue and was not planned. Granted, they had a whole term (b-section before this) to work out kinks, and evidently they missed some. Not everyone hated this system though. Ngl, it was wonderful to wake up 5 minutes before class and not have to get dressed some mornings while still being able to attend other classes f2f. That said, I understand why some teachers didn't want to do f2f, ie immune systems are weak, they're older, they got children/family, OR THEY SIMPLY DIDNT WANT TO GET THE ILLNESS. Most of the lectures were going to be the same whether you attended a class or not. I'd argue this system is better because the lectures are recorded and I can rewatch if need be, else just normally email the teacher questions anyway. Not everyone is willing to risk their lives just so you could listen to someone talk to your face the same they would in a youtube vid (essentially). I'm glad they still had the term so that I wasn't going to be sitting around an extra term doing nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe pass/fail would be incredibly nice though and I hope they can bring it back this term. Just don't insult the administration because they'll only make them more reluctant to do so. If a child is crying cause they want a piece of candy, the correct parenting move is to not give them the candy. If the child behaved like a functioning member of society, they could expect to see a reward if they then asked for it.",

It would be nice to get some of the money spent on that back",

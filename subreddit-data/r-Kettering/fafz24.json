I'd rather people know and me look like an idiot than have someone miss their final at 7:30 I can't even get myself out of bed at that time for work how are we supposed to be at exams at that time",

They could have at least given the room a good name like \"Kettering e-sports arena\" or the \"student torture and examination room\" to more accurately depict what the room will be used for. \n\nThis is an unedited shitpost",

Downvote away.\n\nYou're = You are\n\nYou were looking for 'your', as in \"This exam is *yours*\" or \"*Your* grammar is atrocious and *you're* going to want to check yourself before you make fun of Kettering for their signage\"\n\nBut I will concede that expensive signs are way more high stakes than a meme, so carry on :)",

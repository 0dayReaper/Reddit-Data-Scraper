I know that Kettering has graduated some undergraduate triple majors.   I taught what I think was the first Kettering triple major (CS/CE/EE), but I know there have been a few other combinations.    But once we started adding Master's degrees, that might've changed the stat a bit.\n\nI have no idea what the largest number of minors would be.   I've seen enough double minors for that to be unremarkable.   But I don't know what the maximum is.",

The KU website was only set up to handle 4 originally and now that I'm going for 5 or 6, I was feeling curious. I'm glad the university doesn't limit the number because it has helped compel me to keep going and graduate. \nThank you so much for the information, Professor. I will definitely reach out!",

If they were capitalist corporations, they wouldn\u2019t be cancelling well loved products like Mr. Potato head and Dr. Suess, they\u2019d be maximizing their revenue flow by selling more of these things. \n\nCorporations are working together to bring about communism. Then, all the corporations will have all the power, even more power than the government, and will have nothing to stop them from doing bad things like charging us too much for goods, using their immense power to sway government decisions, and not paying us a living wage. Unless we stand against communism they\u2019re gonna start doing all those things.",

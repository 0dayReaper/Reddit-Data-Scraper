    "postText": "I decided to go almost 100% online this semester. Is anyone else facing excessive aggression from their professors about it? I have a professor who continuously makes comments about us 'sleeping' during class or not paying attention or the quality of the class being so much worse virtually and it makes the learning environment really hostile and has made me pretty much check out of the class for the semester. It sucks to have to juggle a global pandemic, school, and the guilt of wanting to be safe all at once.",

Sam K is the best and has been there for me more times than I can count. If nothing else, they at least make sure that you feel heard, and imo the profs that I had a problem with started talking about it way less as the semester went on. Whether that was the ASC or coincidence I could never tell you.\n\nNot that it matters now, since campus is quarantined, but y'know if/when it becomes relevant, you know what to do!",

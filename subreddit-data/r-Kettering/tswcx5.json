If you did something wrong and this was the first instance, then a simple warning would be ok -- no yelling lol\n\nIf you think it's appropriate, send the supervisor an email documenting that this happened by saying something along the line \"I want to apologize for the misunderstanding. I was told that xyz task needed to be completed by upper management and took the initiative to do so, but next time I will confirm with you before moving forward. However, I do feel that the way the situation was handled made me very uncomfortable\" and so on and so forth. And if you're not okay in sending that message to the supervisor, just contact HR or your kettering Co op manager",

Then having students clean and check people in.\n\nKettering rec center is largely run day to day by students. FMs, Equipment, and Front Desk are students. Making sure everything is clean, setups for events and sports, usually all done by students.\n\nBasically, Kettering can save money by operating on a skeleton crew and not hire three to four full staff, which's cost minimum of around ~35 thousand for each annually. \n\nPeople already mentioned it but they already have a hard time scheduling shifts right now",

In addition, to not having people able to work those hours. If you would like to suggest additional hours you can contact Linda Dvorsak or Mike Schaal and they can look into expanding the hours. Unfortunately, you are not gonna get much of a response from them on reddit because they don't use reddit.....",

For years, there has been a trend that people do not utilize the morning times. In the past, we use to open at 7:30 on 2-3 select days during the week. This situation is similar to why the library had shortened their hours a few terms ago.",

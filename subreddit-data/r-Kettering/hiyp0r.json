    "postText": "So- I have no entire clue what is going on- and I just got residence stuff.\n\n- Job stuff: I still need to submit my resume, but is there anything else ai have to do afterwards? I'm super behind on that.. just because I have to edit and wait for somethings. Isn't the first submission of a resume supposed to be in the Kettering Force?\n\n- Residence. So; I requested to move in on the 11th instead of 12th.. do we get any information abt it?\n\n- Kinda awk to ask, but does anyone know which floors are for which? Like- male only / female only /co-ed. I got assigned to floor 3\n\n-Gender neutral bathrooms: where are they located at? Same place at the end of the hall?\n\n-A-A or A-B sections?? What????? I feel that I'm not getting emails or something. I'm looking in both the email registered for the engineering hives, and my kettering email.\n\nHow do clubs work with this then? \n\n-Engine hives: it was a thing that happened, but I'm curious if anyone won the raffle at the end.\n\n-Freshman Orientation: I know it is virtual, but I believe it is running thru the 6th to the 8th of July?\n\nThanks for answering in advance, I have no clue what is going on.\nI just hope I can pass calc 3...",

They'll probably be real helpful about getting you into the building the day earlier\n- all the floors usually end up being co-ed pretty much, just some of the hallways on them might be all guys or all girl\n- they used to be the most centrally located ones on each floor if I remember right from my senior year. Your hallway can also usually vote to make one of the bathrooms located on it gender neutral (a bit hazy on details since I've been an alumni for a while and barely lived in the dorms)\n- no clue on that one, sorry\n- I would think it would end up being on a club-by-club basis with some weird Kettering rules thrown in there for fun\n- also no clue on that\n- not sure again\n- like me, I'm sure most people have no clue what's happening, so hopefully you feel like you're in good company!",

Wondering because gender is confusing and it wouldd be nice to have some support or help or something idk honestly.\n\n Most of my questions got answered thru emails that maybe were delayed or something but yeah. Just wondering, looking towards the future, did you stay on campus all the time, or was it just for freshman year? I heard that its a lot cheaper to stay in the residences located outside of campus, but like yeah... \n\nAlso, would it be more helpful to get cengage unlimited to get web assign with it, for calculus classes or just get the code and then books online / Amazon?",

It wasn't hard then, but it seemed to be going smoother bathroom wise when I was heading out.\n\nI lived off campus every term after the first semester in a fraternity house that I joined. But if going Greek isn't your thing, you can save a ton of money by doing a array of things. After freshman year and the mandate on living in the dorms ended (not sure if that's still a thing) I know people who lived at their parents' and commuted in, I know people who lived in the apartments across the street, and people who rented houses just off campus with friends. If you can get a good crew of people who won't flake, renting a house can get seriously cheap.\n\nDepends on how you like to use text books. Someone or yourself can probably find a way to get you the pdf of the text book and teacher's edition (which really helped me learn calculus, honestly). And if you work great off of PDFs, then you'll be golden getting a copy for most likely free and just paying for web assign separate. If you work best from a book, I'd compare costs and see if there's any savings buying new vs buying used with a web assign key.",

It's like a term investment, but with a lot more interest - the profit comes in the form of $bake, which you can then sell for money. The other option is spend it at supported retailers or online stores. Or use it to split dinner bills drinks, or poker bets. \n\nIf you do sell, you can buy back in later to support the coin, or in the dip, or you can sell only part, and keep the rest in for even better longer term rewards (if it goes to a buck this year, it's bound to be 2, or 1.5 etc next, and eventually maybe double digit something).\n\nYou can mix and match whatever, but you can make money without ever selling a single dogecoin.",

But not when it moves a few cents, you hold it for a few months or even a year or two untill it reaches very high prices so you can make the highest profit possible. You can of course buy and sell along the way to make small but steady profits but this is DOGE coin so everyone wants it to go over the dollar mark.",

            "comment": "Hey guys. Sorry for the long read.\n\nI just want to put out there that there is a possibility that the current move upwards might reverse at .077 where the upper trendline is located to complete its =descending Fibonacci extension located at .048, which would coincide with the lower trendline bounce. Major support is located in the .041-.042 region (Daily Pivot and 4h major support). This would also coincide with previous take profit margins and in hence would stimulate new money. Just wanna warn you that this could happen and not to panic sell because a take profit to these depths would be normal with Day traders, scalpers etc. Also don't forget that 1 wallet has over 29% of all doge and if he sells he can make it crash big time. This is meant as encouragement however, want to let you know that this scenario COULD happen and not to panic if it does come to pass. Even a sell-off of this size would still leave the uptrend technicals bullish and positive. Remember you don't loose any money if you don't sell. This is a marathon guys, not a race! Even if we have had massive gains in the past few weeks you have to expect take profits and retracements as they provide the information for technical traders for the next leg up. IF you know nothing about trading i would suggest that you look at Tradingview Ideas. a lot of pro traders will display their ideas. I believe that this would be a positive thing as it will give you advanced warning of what imight happen which in turn will reassure you in the coin's potential. Because this coin has extreme potential. The technicals are great and the fundamentals ( positive news, celeb support etc) are even better. Daytona Nissan and some ford dealer now accepting dogecoin as payment is a huge thing and a big message. Also be aware that NASDAQ will be adding a crypto aspect soon. It was announced today for the guys that might of missed it. Love this coin and this community. Lets go to the moon together. I have for over 12k USD invested in doge, not only because of its profit potential versus other coins, but especially because of its super strong community and the aspiration's it generates. Like people saying they will donate 10% of their money to animal shelters when it reaches 1$ just shows what a quality community this is.",

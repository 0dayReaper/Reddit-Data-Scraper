Dogecoin is still at new ATHs but slowly the attention surrounding it begins to fade as something else in Crypto begins to take the spotlight. What could happen? Could DOGE stabilize and maybe even continue to rise slowly? Sure.\n\nBut also just as likely, people begin to sell. Causes mass panic as people don\u2019t want to miss out on profits and the price tanks. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed for either side what will happen but it\u2019s not a safe long term investment because of that risk. So in my opinion, he isn\u2019t wrong.",

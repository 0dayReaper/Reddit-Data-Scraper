Missing out on this boom will give Coinbases competitors alot of  growth they would have missed otherwise. I'll be interested to see if Kraken uses these gains appropriately to increase their services and compete more with coinbase. I feel coinbase is still a great platform dont get me wrong, but they left a ton of money on the table this quarter and their competitors may use that advantage to compete harder in the future and reduce coinbases stake in the market over all as Kraken has debated launching an IPO as well",

It is at least 3 out of 4.\n\nContinues with ad hominem attacks against the character of the SEC chair, with allegations of corruption and bribery, that are not backed by any data or even court rulings.\n\nIt also fails to mention the order by the White House to crack down on Crypto Exchanges, that Gensler is executing as is demanded by his job.\n\nBut a lot of people buy into the propaganda from CEXs and Wall street firms who want to get rid of the first SEC chair in a long time that actually does anything.\n\nBig firms do not want regulation, so they want yet another industry-shill at the SEC that lets them do whatever they want to steal your money.\n\nInstead of looking at facts, these bad actors try to spread fear among investors, attacking the character of people and misleading them away from actual facts.\n\nGensler could have done a better job, no question. But 90% good job is just 10% away from a really good job, not at 0%.... \n\nBinance and Coinbase have been toxic for years. It was just a matter of time for regulators to catch up with them. They get what they deserve, for the better of crypto as a whole.",

They should crack down much harder on scammers. They are currently only doing 10% of what they should be doing, but that's already a pain in the butt of the criminals that took your money and intend to take even more.\n\nHe could dial up his aggression by 1000% and still not manage to remove all corruption from the financial markets within the few years he has available.\n\nThe only people who benefit from an attack on the SEC are criminals. I do not support criminals. If you do, question your life choices.",

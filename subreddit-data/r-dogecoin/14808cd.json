    "postText": "The purpose of this post is to post relationships of doge relative to if countries, businesses, people provided below. This is intended for these wild what if scenarios purely to value if statements \n\nThe global \u201cvalue\u201d of currency is $83,000,000,000,000 (83 trillion dollars) in the world wide. There is only 139,742,006,383.71 DOGE (139 billion)\n\nOn May 8, 2021, Dogecoin briefly reached its highest market capitalization of $88.8 Billion with a price of $0.6818 per Dogecoin. \n\nLet\u2019s assume these far off scenarios take place at the same day and time to make math simpler. Or in other words maintaining the same circulating supply. \n\n88,800,000,000 = $.6818 \nFor similar math let\u2019s us 88.8 trillion as world currency \n88,800,000,000,000 = $681.8 per doge \n\nIf 10% of worlds supply is invested/utilizing doge for its cheap transactions \n\n8,800,000,000,000 = $68.18 per doge\n\nThe us has $2,344,000,000,000 dollars (\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f) (2.34 trillion) \n \nThis is roughly 1 doge being equivalent to $18.16 usd \n\nIf 10% of the USD was invested in doge it would be $1.816\n\nChina has 10.47 trillion yuan in circulation at the end of 2022. That\u2019s 1,465,237,342,200 usd. If all Yuan was doge. 1 Doge would be 11.35 usd. 10% is 1.35. \n\nIf 10 percent of us and china invested in doge. $1 doge would be $3.16 usd. \n\nTesla is $789 billion dollars. 789,000,000,000 almost 10x doge at its peak. Almost $6.81\n\nAmazons 978 billion. As of June 2023 Apple has a market cap of $2.890 Trillion. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how this is possible but As of April 2023, the total market capitalization of domestic companies listed on stock exchanges worldwide recorded as 108.23 trillion U.S. dollars. If all of that was put into doge. One doge would be $830.81. \n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80",

But, the fanbase of doge has grown considerably. The forces that would drive us past 50 cents are likely also to zoom us past $4. It all comes down to the completion of several projects to integrate doge into the market place and for crypto to overcome the legal challenges now being presented in the courts. If we don't get past those, we will likely never see a dollar. If we do, I think we will most likely hit at least $1T market cap, or $8/doge.",

If you have less in circulation it is a factor, but not necessarily the driving factor.

Otherwise, you have same throughput but variable state of coins in circulation which really only means something until the moment one person liquidates, then there is a mad rush.",

I suspect it overshoots on the first rally, and gets over 2 dollars.\n\nDon't forget 99% of cryptos are essentially under SEC suspicion rn, and everyone has 2021's performance in recent memory.  \n\n\nIt's worth noting tho that peak prices do not require x amount of money put in, to reach y marketcap. It's just whatever buying and selling is happening at the time.",

Are you going to completely live your life with DOGE? Are you going to avoid taxation with DOGE? Block chain tech will make banking easier, but to replace any % of a countries currency is to diminish the country's currency in the first place, no country will openly destroy their own currency.",

Crypto's still make up 30% of my current portfolio. And most are sitting well below -30% because I (like so many) fell for the lines going up, and the hype train. It felt like you were apart of something. Now, we the people, the bag holders, the every day man, sit here and squabble until the next tech guru is bored and starts a pump. i'm not cynical, its just most investing is drove by fear or greed. and too many people are losing money being told to buy something they wont need.",

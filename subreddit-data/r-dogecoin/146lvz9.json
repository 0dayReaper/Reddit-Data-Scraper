With multiple devices stored in separate safe places.\n\nThen grab a copy of the coinb.in website and stick that on those devices. You can generate transactions offline that way, and you can also generate new wallets to add to your masterfile.\n\nOh, and NEVER throw away a key. Even if you empty a wallet, stop using it, or it gets compromised, don\u2019t delete it. Just mark it as compromised or whatever with a comment in your text file. Because you can\u2019t control people sending coins. I once found 50,000 Doge in a wallet I thought was dead.",

It's dificult but that already happen to Attom, there is nothing that prevent to happen again.\n\nThe most common tactic used when hacking is phishing, so no brag to anyone you have crypto. Another disadvantage of software wallets is that you probably have installed on your phone, what happens when you lost your phone or is stolen, or someone get acces to it without you knowledge? That another risk. Also, most people keeps a file in their devices or the cloud with their passwords, seed phrases, etc.\n\nFor me, this is my ranking of security to store your crypto\n1- Paper wallet (free, ment for holding, inconvenient yo use, super secure)\n2- Hard wallet ($$$, ment for holding, somehow inconvenient,  very secure)\n3- Software wallet (free-$$, ment for trading and holding, very easy to use, somehow secure)\n4- Exchange (free, ment for tradeing, very easy to use, the least secure)",

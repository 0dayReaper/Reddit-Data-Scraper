I always wondered how he managed, until I saw him in action. He would hit on anything that moved. If he got shot down, it didn't bother him in the least. Off he'd go to his next victim. He'd strike out 19 times and then on the 20th he'd get lucky. It's all about the numbers. You can't hit a home run unless you swing the bat.",

I can\u2019t claim that one! That happened when we went to America \u2013 for some reason they thought it was an English phrase for masturbation. I thought that was quite interesting, and it made people talk about the song and created more interest, so it didn\u2019t hurt I don\u2019t think, but that wasn\u2019t the intention. It was just a love song.\n\nhttps://www.songwritingmagazine.co.uk/how-i-wrote/turning-japanese-the-vapors\n\nAlso: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0X3CLJVMJU\n\nYou're welcome.",

If this even keeps up for two months, there's going to be some SERIOUS crying by those who cashed in. I missed getting into BTC with $850 bucks, from a coin flip, made 7k on Litecoin, and, now Doge is here. Why are morons saying that crypto has \"rules?\" Rule #1, there are none. Rule #2 get in early, and big, and hold. Rule #3 Read rule #1 again.",

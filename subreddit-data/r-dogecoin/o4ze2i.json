Did not sell or purchase anymore since then. As of today, while Doge is trading at (approximation, but we'll use exact values for example's sake) $.17 per coin. You now have $17000. Doge continues to drop, say to $.16. You buy back in with the $17000 and you would have 106250 coins, a 6250 coin increase from your original 100k coins.\n\nOr are you simply saying you won't sell any now because you're not confident that Doge will drop any further, thus you're unwilling to risk selling with the intent to \"buy lower\" in the event that it rises &amp; you have to buy higher &amp; have less coins? I can understand that.. but I'm getting skeptical now. Every massive dip Doge has taken over the past two months had me thinking \"yeah, it'll stabilize and then BOOM, it'll start climbing again! It won't go lower.\" Then after every stabilization since, aside from a small climb here or there (2-5 cents worth), Doge has plummeted further.",

Even the most experienced traders can be caught and overtaken by sudden events that could see an overnight plunge in prices, turning a day trader into a 4-year Hodler. No one is ever prepared for such unforseen events. I think the only lesson here is to trade with a stop loss always, and don\u2019t turn a small losing trade into a massive losing investment.",

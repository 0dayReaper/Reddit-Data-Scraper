It merely means that the most recent trading price of the last coins traded is $10. There is no strong implication for what every single coin is worth - because people are not rational, and may not be looking to buy or sell at that time (so actually the circulating supply isn't that much), or they may have even higher hopes for coin price, etc.\n\n**Market cap is almost meaningless when it comes to crypto.** [See this very good explanation in r/Cryptocurrency.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5wkwq/will_doge_be_worth_100_a_coin_can_it_become_as/gx3y8c5/) Prices go where the whales and the crowd push them to. There's no fundamental valuation to limit them, only short-term supply and demand. Yes, if the growth in buying demand can't be sustained, the price (and mcap) can easily collapse.",

Money in the form of investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies exceeds $1.2 quadrillion.   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The total value of **all cryptocurrencies** on April 13, **2021**, was **more** than $2.2 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap, and the total value of **all** bitcoins, the most popular digital **currency**, was pegged at about $1.2 trillion.    \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So add $37 trillion to $1.2 quadrillion.... you get $1.237 quadrillion dollars in total of all the money in world combined. Dogecoin hits $200 a coin, times 127 billion coins (currently only 113 billion mined)... that's $25.4 trillion.   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$25.4 trillion is only 2% of the entire money in the world (the $1.237 quadrillion).  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Am I sitting here screaming \"IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN!!!\" No. But it's not an absurd goal..... to think it's absurd, is absurd. I'm also not saying to dump all your hard earned money into the coin, but just don't let a handful of people ruin it for you.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pretty sure the ones whining about Doge and thinking people are morons for not losing hope.... are the ones who are too heavily invested in other cryptos that they didn't jump on the Doge train as soon as they should have, so now they are just bashing it any chance they can because if you take the money out of Doge, you will probably put it into other cryptos.... which makes their investments rise.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyone catching my drift?  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And if it was such a horrible economic absurdity, I doubt anyone would be accepting dogecoin... the MLB, NBA, Traveling agencies, hotels, shops, etc. are accepting Doge... so it must not be COMPLETELY absurd, and if anything, it will hold value over time.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;HAPPY DOGE-ING!",

Fiat CURRENCY ( people mix up MONEY and CURRENCY) far too often. \nDogecoin is a growing currency and the more people who put belief behind it will start to determine its value. \nNow - with that said; its hard to imagine(not impossible) it can hit BTC or ETH prices without having a massive dip. Reason being - i think the goal is to establish a global currency and so we can have a fast transferring digital credit that has no cap so it can grow as fast as people are willing to accept. (This is powerful and awesome) \n\nWe also see continual growth because everyone who is trying to jump in this game is hopefully doing it the right way and not on Robinhood - so their information is probably pending a little slower. ( thats speculation / my observation at least)",

Tho of course, those outcomes become increasingly improbable.\n\nI don't know enough about crypto or economics to make predictions.  I do know that $8 is, mathematically, the top possible range (barring any massive shifts in the market), and $3 is optimistic for \"the working man's meme-coin\".\n\nI doubt I'll profit-take at $1, i'll wanna watch it for awhile.  it might settle in around there for a while, or it might just well keep going if it Shibus into the banking mainstream  (when you can buy it from Bank of America and Wells Fargo and spend it at 7-11).",

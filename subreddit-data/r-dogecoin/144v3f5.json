That means customers won't be able to sell Doge or other coins on Binance US and withdraw the money.  Furthermore, the direction of this crisis does not bode well for what may come next.  Binance US may completely shut down its American operations.\n\nI do not have a crystal ball, so I don't know the future.  However, the situation at Binance US looks critical.  I have a friend who got their coins out of FTX just 2 days before everything froze there, so I am acutely aware how dangerous and fast moving these situations can be.",

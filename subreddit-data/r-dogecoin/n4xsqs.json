The bull rush dumping of profits are to good to pass up. They will rebuy in the dip. The price will drop massively if I had to guess. Once it passes BNB. I imagine coming back down to 0.3/4 before rising again. Then again it may not drop at all. Its being traded constantly on gate.io to the point its number 2 on spot trades and that's the same across a number of exchanges.\n\nWith it being used as an actual currency to. And the update to make it cheaper and faster to use and xrps ongoing legal issues there is no reason this coin won't cement its position at rank 3 - 6",

Mined a bunch and was gifted them back when everyone was handing them out.\n\nI'm not even considering selling now. I still know it's going up, but I'm actually poor, so the thought of eventually having enough money to maybe get into my /r/vandwellers future is pretty hopeful. Again, if my files still work.

I figured I would buy the next dip.... there wasn't one for a long time, I forgot about it, got mad every time I looked at the price and said \"ehhh, it'll come back down, that is insane.

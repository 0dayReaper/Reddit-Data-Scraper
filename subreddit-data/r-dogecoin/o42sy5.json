That intersection is considered the \"death cross\" and has been a consistent indicator of a coming crash in both crypto and stock markets.\n\nI'm not convinced that this is the case this time. There are a lot of factors working in Bitcoin's favor and what's good for Bitcoin is good for crypto.\n\nBut I might be seeing what I want to see.",

The  dogecoin inflation rate is 5 billion coins, now compare that to the USD inflation rate during the pandemic expected around 4%... even comparing it to CURRENT standards, dogecoin will only be having an inflation of around 3% this year... Dogecoin is infinitely inflating, it always has inflation, funny story though, so  does basically every printable currency... However the inflation % is predictable and currently stable and low. Comparing that to countries that can change their inflation rates based on necessity, dogecoin is a haven, same as most coins, because the rules are set upon creation... and rarely changed.",

Do I wish I had the Bitcoin back from selling at 15?  Sure.  Somewhere somebody sold it at 2k in 2017 and regretted it in December when it went to 19k.  Somewhere somebody sold at 19k in 2017, thought \u201cWhoo, glad I got out just in time\u201d, and then they completely missed the run up to 64k.  When you don\u2019t sell you will have a reason to regret it, when you do sell you will have a reason to regret it.  Since both will happen you might as well keep it in if you won\u2019t need the money for awhile because eventually it makes another run up.  (It\u2019s different if you will need the cash though since you don\u2019t want to sell at the bottom)",

He said Christ would return. Christ is a mindset. The likeness of Yashua was modeled after the then ruler of Rome, the Ceaser of the time, because he saw the influence he had over people and thought to himself that if he modeled depictions of him after himself, it would bring him to the same kind of power. Henceforth: I have no issue with the face of a Shib taking the spot of a ceasers face.\n\nDo your research on things you choose to believe in if you actually believe them to be true and real.\nIt is only at this point you will realize why so many people choose to believe in Doge.",

If you have it on CB you can send it somewhere else if the platform starts to do sketchy things. If Paypal starts to do sketchy things you have to sell it and rebuy it somewhere else.  \n\n\n\"Why is that important?\" you're probably asking. There are multiple reasons, but there are 3 things that this can do that stand out most:\n\n* Having a wallet allows you to actually spend the money.\n* Being able to transfer between wallets can significantly reduce the potential tax liabilities.\n* Being able to transfer between wallets (usually) shortens the time it takes to move to another place.  \n\n\nLastly, having a wallet ensures that you actually own the crypto. Otherwise you just are taking someone's word that you own it, and if GME has taught us anything; you can't trust these brokers.",

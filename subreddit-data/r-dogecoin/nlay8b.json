In a few years, we are all going to be laughing that we got low fixed rates and DOGE paid everything off. My mortgage is still cheaper than the cheapest place to rent around where I'm at.",

I\u2019m a doge hodler and bought in at .05 and DCA since and I believe in the community, but the idea that doge will be $100 anytime in the near future is just setting people up for disappointment. The coin is super inflationary right now. There\u2019s no cap and 10,000 coins are generated like every 30 mins or whatever it is. Sure I\u2019m no expert and I\u2019m not a financial advisor, but let\u2019s focus on $1 sometime this summer. And maybe $2 by the end of the year. If things are going well and adoption is increasing, than maybe $5 sometime next year and $10 the year after. Many reputable analysts say it\u2019s nearly impossible to achieve these $5 or $10 price points due to demand but being able to keep up with supply. I\u2019m optimistic but IMO we should at least set proper expectations \u270c\ud83c\udffc",

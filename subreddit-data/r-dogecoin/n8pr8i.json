YOU DO NOT own any Cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood and send it to your own wallet for example, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency.\n\nRobinhood has shown in the past that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.\n\nIf you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. You can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes you through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step. And answers most of the questions one might have in the beginning. The process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood.\n\nYou can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there.\n\nMore in-depth explanation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6i468/ditch_robinhood/",

I believe there\u2019s a chance he was blocked by producers or the network or members of the board of Tesla itself. There are a lot of ties with old money represented there - and though Musk has a lot of power, he can still be shut down. So I think it\u2019s possible the way things went last night represented in part a power play \u2014 and today Musk is trying to set the narrative back in place.",

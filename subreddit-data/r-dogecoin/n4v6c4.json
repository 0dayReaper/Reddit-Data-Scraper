Look up Care Credit if you don't know about it. \n2. There are an absolute boatload of grants out there. My old list is below. You have to track them down... there's no one centralized databank of resources. \n3. Go Fund Me helps\n4. Please, know when enough is enough (not saying situation is that bad, I don't know). I bought my boy a good year followed by a less than stellar last month with ups and downs. I had a never say die attitude and I regret it just as much as I would have regretted doing it too soon. Don't beat yourself up either way you lean on this situation and know that your pal has something few beings of any species ever get on this Earth, someone that loves them no matter what. \n5. Make sure you look into Stereotactic radiation/chemo. Fidocure does genomic sequencing to direct the best possible treatment. They suck as a company to talk to but they're the only game in town. \n\nMy boy's name was Chance. Think of him from time to time please if any of this helps you. \n\nActors and others- California only   \nAll4Pets - Application submitted 11/27   \nAll Creatures - NJ only   \nAnimal Care and Assistance Fund - Does not qualify   \nAnimal Care for Artists - redirects to someone selling coolers   \nAnimal Friends Rescue - no funds   \nAnimal Lover's League - Broken link URL for sale   \nAnimal Welfare Assistance Program - Monteray County only   \nAssistance Dogs Special Allowance Program - Obviously doesn't qualify   \nBeing Stray - Strays etc only   \nBeyond Breed's Ruff Riders - Food only.

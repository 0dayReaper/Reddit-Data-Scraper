YOU DO NOT own any cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood and send it to your own wallet for example, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. In addition to this, while Robinhood markets themselves on being \"fee-less\", you're actually paying above current market price when buying there, due to the way their order book is set up. You would never have that issue on a real exchange where the order book is completely transparent and the spread is visible.\n\nRobinhood has shown in the past over and over again that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies when the price starts to surge in either direction which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.\n\nIf you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. You can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes you through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step, where you have full control over your funds. The articles in the guide should also answer most of the questions one might have starting out.\n\nDon't be too concerned if you've already registered on Robinhood, the process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood. It might feel like a bit of a hassle in the short term, but you're much better off in the long run.\n\nYou can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there.\n\nMore in-depth explanation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6i468/ditch_robinhood/",

                            "comment": "The infinite supply remark is misleading. About 5 billion coins are mined each year. For perspective, an increase of 2.5 billion paper notes (USD) was added in 2019 after accounting for what was shredded. So although it can be infinite, those bounds aren't being reached.\n\nInfinite supply was changed because crypto can be lost just like regular currency if the crypto wallet is lost, and an infinite, but regulated, supply is better for inflation. So it helps with stability so that the price of a doge doesn't reach something astronomically high, like say $60k. Because a currency that costs as much as a house isn't exactly practical.\n\nAlso, I have 0 economic education and a bare minimum understanding of crypto. I just Google things. To the best of my knowledge, this is at least somewhat accurate",

They can't afford to just keep dumping cash and they surely don't have the confidence to after losing so much.\n\n\nPersonally that's not my problem, I bought in at like 7 cents or something, but a lot of the advice around here feels like it's basically \"just keep spending money, bro, what's the problem?\"",

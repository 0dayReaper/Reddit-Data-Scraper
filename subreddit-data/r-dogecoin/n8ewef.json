                                    "comment": "The key to selling and buying the dips is that you have to be ok if you don't get re-entry. Its psychological - greed of losing out maximum return + fear of not being able to get entry again. It's much easier said than done, but nothing wrong with selling half or some portion at 2x, 3x, 5x+ gains and then when it drops from that point buying more or even if it doesn't re-entering for less at the next dip. The goal by cashing out is to hedge. Hedging is risk management and when effective reduces the amount of loss but when not effective reduces the amount of gain. The hope is always for a hedge to be worthless -  it's like insurance. You don't get car insurance hoping to get into a car accident but have it just in case. That's the point of hedging - you sell a portion of gains to earn that profit just in case the asset collapses, but of course it would be great if it continued to go up and the portion remaining will continue growing in profit. The challenge is that when it comes to investment/speculation hedging, people don't make a decision up front what is too much risk - is +$100k, 100x gain, is it +$50k, 200x gain, is it +$2k, 2x gain, or is it +$300, 30% gain.  By not deciding up front, it becomes emotional of what it could be (good or bad) often leading to decision paralysis. In cases where the hedge results in reduced gains, people often beat themselves up for the profit potential lost out (myself included) and have a tendency not to hedge in the future, but it's the wrong perspective because no one ever went broke earning profit.",

Crypto will attract it's crooks but kindness and love is more abundant. Put your value where you see fit! We all care very much about turning 1 into 1m without doing anything and that's the thrill of it all. Pay your dues and invest in what you believe in and most importantly...

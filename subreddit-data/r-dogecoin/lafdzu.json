It has no use as a currency, currently it's useless as an investment because unlike BTC (who is already unstable asf but doesn't dip to literally nothing and constantly goes up because of its nature), this coin will forever go down in value unless it becomes a defacto international currency, which it wont.\n\nSo what's the end goal? Making a quick buck out of it. And if you end up asking yourself \"Wait, how's that gonna work? Buy at .06 and sell at .1?\" or \"But when will I know to sell?\", then you're exactly the kind of people taken advantage of here.\n\nTo anyone reading this, if you're not one of the few that bought in at sub .001 and you're not holding literally dozens of thousands of coins, you WILL be left in the dust when those big players cash out when Dogecoin hits $0.10, there is no moon, there is no holding for years, this is a pump and dump.",

Then the mining will slow down and Dogecoin will adjust for inflation because of the investors that accumulate over time. It's actually ingenious. Leaving it uncapped and offering such a cheap commission for mining was genius. Don't let these people fool you. Dogecoin truly has a future. Do you think Pornhub and travala would accept it as payment if It didn't? Elon Musk wouldn't waste his breath on Dogecoin if it had no real future. The guys who are knowledgeable about Crypto are telling you to sell because they want to buy as cheap as possible. Don't listen to them. Just stick to the plan and don't bet more than you are willing to lose and we will all make it.",

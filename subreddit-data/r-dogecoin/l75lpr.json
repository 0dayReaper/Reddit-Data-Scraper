I'd literally cry for hours\n\nbecause market cap Determines in large part the price increase of a coin.  Meaning that the more money people put into a coin the larger the market cant. meaning that if there is a market Of $2 billion it means there are $2 billion that people have invested in the coin. and because of the supply amount of the coin compared to the $2 billion market cap Its not really designed for the price to soar like other coin. For this coin to reach a dollar it requires the overall people invest $100 billion of money in this coin. at the high end its probably possible given enough time. and if you have sufficient enough invested in this coin and you can make a lot of money if it reaches one dollar. but people are unrealistic saying that this could reach $100. $100 would require a market Of $1 trillion. Meaning people have to invest 1 trillion dollars, I can guarantee that is not going to happen any time soon.",

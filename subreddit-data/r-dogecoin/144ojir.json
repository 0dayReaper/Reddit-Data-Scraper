Then you will see the \"Send\" and \"Receive\" buttons underneath \"Your Position.\" You can then send any quantity to an address you control.  I don't believe DogeCard is a wallet.  It appears to just be a debit card that rewards you with DOGE when you make purchases in dollars.  Having them hold your DOGE looks even riskier than keeping it on RH.  It's best to store crypto on a hardware wallet (or a software wallet installed on a computer that never touches the Internet).",

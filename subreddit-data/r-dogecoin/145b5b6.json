    "postText": "Dogecoin is about to shake things up like never before. While other cryptocurrencies have faced scrutiny from the SEC and been labeled as unregistered securities, Dogecoin clearly not a security this is a positive. \n\nDogecoin\u2019s unique status as a non-security is about to send shockwaves through the market. In the next bull run, I predict with utmost confidence that Dogecoin will claim a spot among the top three coins, plus a new \n\nThe recent regulatory changes have opened up a world of opportunities for Dogecoin, igniting a fierce rally in its value. The impact could be so monumental that Dogecoin may surpass the $1 mark, reaching maybe even $2. A lot of the cash from the selling of the crypto marked as securities will flow into Doge. And the Doge-1 taking off. It will be back to back hype soon.",

            "comment": "Dogecoin is very decentralized, as is Bitcoin, and Litecoin.  Also, I think Ethereum is one of the few DEFI projects that's legitimately decentralized.\n\nMy 2 cents:  Everything else is potentially a security, everything else is heavily CEFI.  There are \\~30,000 different cryptos, coins, tokens, platforms, etc.  Just a few years ago less than a 100.\n\nI think DEFI/CEFI will survive, but undergo a massive cleansing. Till then my opinion of DEFI/CEFI in general is negative. I think today there's 30,000 cryptos, coins, tokens, platforms, and in the near future, most will be zombies or dead.\n\nThe entire point of crypto was to return a modicum of power to the people. I think the only ones that authentically pursue that in technical terms, as well as social structural terms, are Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.  With the exception of Ethereum, I think most DEFI/CEFI fails miserably at giving some power back to the people.\n\nI also believe, that most DEFI is fake.  It's either strait up CEFI, or a 90%/10% CEFI/DEFI blend.  This fake DEFI, and CEFI are responsible for some of the largest financial losses in history. The likes of FTX ,BlockFI, Celsius, Voyager, Three Arrows, UST, Terra/Luna, Safemoon, and hundreds, maybe thousands of DEFI/CEFI hacks and thefts. (see [rekt.news](https://rekt.news))\n\nIt's like people want to take all the horrible stuff of the banking industry, and re-implement in the crypto space, and combine it with shyster business scams of the 1950s...  Debt, leverage, margin, rewards, interest, earn, staking, derivatives, tokens, centralized leadership , fake whitepapers, fake utility, airdrops, nfts, and countless other ploys, all recycled ideas from the banking industry and bussiness grifters.  Makes legitimate institutions/banks/creditunions/businesses look bad.\n\nDogecoin is a breath of fresh air.  A true asset, and unofficial digital currency.\n\nOf course people need to realize that global factors, and their own personal timing/luck, as well as there being no guarantees, plays a big part in the success or failure, of one's investments.\n\nDon't rely on a time frame for gains, because that's how you get roasted.  Never invest what you can't afford to ignore for years and years.  I expect dogecoin to continue succeeding, but I know that it may not.  Or it may succeed wildly, but maybe the next cycle isn't till 2026.  I have no idea.  But if you bank on an investment performing a certain amount, by a certain time frame, that can lead to disastrous consequences.",

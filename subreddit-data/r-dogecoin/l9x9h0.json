No one is buying heroin with it. And the people selling doge are...probably the people posting these memes. It's also unlimited in how many doge coin there can be. \n\nIn bitcoin everyone can kind of win, because there's buyers outside of speculators and sellers outside of speculators.\n\nDoge be careful.

Additionally, the annual increase basically just keeps up with inflation and that's about it. It's not a huge amount, and people seriously overestimate its impact. Surprisingly, doge is very similar to traditional currencies like the USD, etc... and I think consequentially it has a lot of potential to actually be viable as a \"normal\" currency.\n\nKeep in mind 40% of all coins are eventually lost. That alone blows any inflation from a lack of a cap out of the water by several orders of magnitude.\n\nAt the very least, the levels it's at right now are artificially low. Once public awareness and general usage increases, you can expect it to at least reach $1/coin in short order.",

The real silly part about all this is Dogecoin is exactly as legitimate as any other.  Others just make you work for it and try to create a \"gold standard\" to the currency, but the real world already doesn't care about a God standard.  Money is a believe and nothing more.  Dogecoin is ultimately no different than bitcoin or real cash.  It really isn't.  It doesn't even matter it's a meme coin.  It is a tool for exchange.  The only danger is there's zero regulation, so it can go buck wild up or down.  But that's ok.  It can still be purchased and sold within short enough time frames where it's still stable to use, regardless of it's at $0.0001 or $10,000.  You just have no idea what you have long term... besides a yoyo.",

            "comment": "He sent a tweet out on Jan 7th that said \"the most entertaining outcome is the most likely\". Last night during the interview he admitted that when he talks about DOGE it's meant to be a joke. He does not take it seriously. I believe someone posted a clip below of the portion of the interview where he talks about it. Even when he made the statement as quoted above in the picture, he was chuckling with the guy giving the interview. So for you guys that are blasting him and looking for his support, I don't think you're going to find it. So stop worshiping Elon and LETS ROCKET MOON THIS DOGGY other ways!!",

He was also putting in work and had sway over Solar City. From the inner company gossip it seemed like he was involved to a fault and made the lives of everyone miserable due to the massive amount of hours he\u2019d put in and expect the same from others. No idea what it\u2019s like in 2021, but those were the anecdotes I heard back then.",

Here's an article from 11 years ago (which is a long time, to acknowledge the obvious) about one of Tesla's founders suing Elon Musk for mismanagement of the brand. As a side note, he expresses concern that Musk is driving the brand into the ground which is pretty funny to me, since here a decade later the brand is 1000x stronger. Anyway, this article specifically talks a lot about how one of the founders is angry about the wide spread belief that Musk is the founder of Tesla. Could give you some perspective on the whole topic, cheers. https://gigaom.com/2009/06/14/tesla-lawsuit-the-incredible-importance-of-being-a-founder/",

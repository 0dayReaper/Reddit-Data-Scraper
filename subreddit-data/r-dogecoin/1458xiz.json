It's time to fully utilize the usage and transfer of coins too and from the dedicated DogeCoin network.\n\nMark my words.\n\nRobinhood and Webull will be next. If you point out one, you must point out the many. Crypto reform is coming. Just be ready and wise to it.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)",

Any exchange that can be sued over such reasons as ethics or practices, will be. \n\nRobinhood and Webull both also break the SEC laws and regulations of securities. The moment it is deemed that the majority of the companies assets are cryptos, more specifically all the ones deemed as securities, that is when the true process will be underway.\n\nThe companies will be forced to self regulate for fear of suit. The suit hasn't even really started yet and both Coinbase and Binance have suffered a MASSIVE hit.\n\nLet this be a lesson to them all well learned, as they are all in one way or another, cheating us.\n\nFew exceptions to this exist currently.\nShoutout to kraken for being one of the few that's all about what crypto is really about.\nCompanies like that are both knowingly and unknowingly leading the charge. \ud83d\udc4a",

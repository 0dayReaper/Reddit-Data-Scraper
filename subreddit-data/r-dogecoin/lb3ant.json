I think that at this point interest might be high enough to not let it floor far below 2 cents. that would already be pretty insane, as it's the highest it's spiked up before. but who knows. I'm holding with faith and planning to buy more if it dips hard enough.\n\nIMO people who say that doge is a worthless meme-coin are basically correct but also short-sighted, because as stupid as it sounds in the modern world memes are just starting to carry value. it's just about finding ways to monetize them\n\ndoge has some of the most meme value/interesting history/accessibility in crypto. imagine how many fresh crypto owners are going to be getting ludicrous amounts of doge just for the meme/in hopes of another spike/because cute pupper. with how accessible crypto is becoming I can't wait for the \"pump doge\" YT challenges or w/e.\n\nIDK, i'mma hold and accumulate and see where this whole GME thing goes.",

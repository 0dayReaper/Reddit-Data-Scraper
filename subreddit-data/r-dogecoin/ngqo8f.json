For someone to get rich in this equation, someone else has to get poor. I'm sorry, but it's naieve to think retail investors can beat professional investors at that game. To that end, short of a miracle, the vast majority getting screwed during pump and dumps will be other retail investors, not whales and Wall Street.",

Second of all its literally a ponzi scheme where the original people who hold the most amount of coins are always going to stay at the top. They can cause a massive sell off at will when they unload coins, use profit to buy them back at lower price, and make off with an obscene net profit because people are literally so stupid they think this kind of get rich quick scheme will work out in their favor.\n\nNot to mention when crypto crashes people who are trying to stop their losses can't even log onto their sites to sell. They literally end up holding the bags, every time. And some people learn, but others never do and they come back to get burned time after time.",

YOU DO NOT own any cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood and send it to your own wallet for example, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. In addition to this, while Robinhood markets themselves on being \"fee-less\", you're actually paying above current market price when buying there, due to the way their order book is set up. You would never have that issue on a real exchange where the order book is completely transparent and the spread is visible.\n\nRobinhood has shown in the past over and over again that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies when the price starts to surge in either direction which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.\n\nIf you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. You can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes you through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step, where you have full control over your funds. The articles in the guide should also answer most of the questions one might have starting out.\n\nDon't be too concerned if you've already registered on Robinhood, the process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood. It might feel like a bit of a hassle in the short term, but you're much better off in the long run.\n\nYou can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there.\n\nMore in-depth explanation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6i468/ditch_robinhood/",

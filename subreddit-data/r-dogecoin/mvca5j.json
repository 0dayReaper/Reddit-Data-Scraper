And y'all were 90% up for bants and fun. But I heard this morning that the thread I was enjoying got nuked due to some toxicity with a few posters later. I can only assume our recent influx of moonbois found the post. So, sorry for the hostile moonbois. It's like having wild baboons in the telegram right now, so I feel you. We've implemented some containment measures while they're being civilized specifically because of that toxicity here.\n\nDoge is one of my favorite things in the cryptospace. And I still think the race is fun. Doge to the moon. Memes like this remind me why I bother to wrangle moonbois and help new people. Keep it up Doge bros. I expect to get downvoted to oblivion, and hey fair. Just  feel better apologizing anyway.",

So I finally post a graph of the entire month that shows the first initial peak was .30 centsish and it has spiked and fallen to .30 cents over and over again throughout the past week.

I'm trying to understand the hype surrounding dodge and the techno king from a neutral point of view. \nI'm struggling because it doesn't solve any actual problem like other coins. So I wonder why is there a community supporting it that much besides hype and money to the moon. \n\nMy attempt?\n\nAfter reading Elon musks autobiography I may have a glimpse of why the dodge is connected to Elon Musk the way it is and why Dodge connects the community to Elon Musk. \n\nThe problem Dodge is solving is less an issue but an opportunity to invest in a single person as we saw with other social coins. \n\nIt's more about investing in the vision of bringing #Musktomars and less a pure involvement into some idea of a meme. I believe dodge is slowly evolving into Elon Musks' crypto. It's like a direct share of all 3 big visions and companies of this so-called techno king.  Instead of persuading people into investing in his companies stocks like had had to persuade investors back in time when he was an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, he rather has a more decentralized way of financing his projects. \n\nAnd that's only one reason for the success of this currency and why it could have a greater impact on us even more than most think. \nThat's the idea I could come up with to understand this madness.",

Another huge spike in the magnitude of 5 to 10X and it'll be life-changing for me.  Aside from Doge being a unique chain, I think the novelty alone puts it at $1.  Having ownership of a part of early Cryptocurrency adoption, 20-30 years from now, will be \"cool\".  People will want it for eternity at this point IMO.  It is useful, fun, and cheap.  It will be nostalgic for us in 30 years and worth way more that it is now simply because of that.",

And of course, just my luck, it jumped back up to 7.9 almost immediately after and has stayed relatively stable since. I threw the 400$ into 3 different more stable cryptos that I won\u2019t look at for a few weeks, and plan to do the same via doge with any funds that come into hand as long as it stays within 10 cents. I\u2019ve read some say that with experience you get used to the dips and less finicky about it....but like OP I\u2019m unemployed and 350$ is a lot to me, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d it, I just couldn\u2019t stand the thought of it possibly dipping to below what I put in, so I took what I considered as preemptive action at the time. I\u2019m too emotionally immature and was watching too closely I guess. Next time I\u2019ll have learned my lesson.",

At current circulation doge would need about **18 times** the amount of money invested already to reach $1. This would rank doge as third (currently 14th) in terms of market cap behind bitcoin and ethereum.\n\nDoge also has about 5billion coins added each year to circulating supply, diluting the price.\n\nTake what you will from this but the old adage 'knowledge is power' holds true.",

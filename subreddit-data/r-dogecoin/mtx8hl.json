They can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes them through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step.\n\nYou do not own any cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood. Back in January, Robinhood was accused of restricting users\u2019 trading activities. This was in the middle of the Gamestop saga. Users of Robinhood found themselves unable to buy any Gamestop stock from Robinhood and the matter has made it to US Congress by now. Now In the middle of the current run Dogecoin is having, a number of users across social media have reported being unable to buy or sell their Dogecoin on Robinhood.\n\nThis is eerily similar to the incident where users weren\u2019t able to buy Gamestop stock. You cannot transfer or withdraw your Dogecoin either, as you\u2019re not actually buying a crytocurrency on Robinhood, but an \u201dIOU\u201d.",

My current banks will only do wire transfers to Title companies for real estate transactions, at least for the account types I have.  Does binance support other options?  Thanks.\n\nEdit, I finally had some time to look into it (USA here).  You can link an account for ACH transfers with Binance (so no need to do wire transfers).  However, after setting it up this morning, I've been so-far unsuccessful in buying any coin via my account ACH--I am getting an error that says if I keep getting it to contact support.",

These days when we talk cryptos he just smiles at me while I shake my head and listen to his input. I guess Boomers can learn too. BTW I now hold Doge along with a few other coins which I bought at .30.",

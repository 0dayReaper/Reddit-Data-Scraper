I thought we wanted doge to be a legitimately recognized and traded cryptocurrency?\n\nIf you are only looking at profit potential, you are only contributing to these fluctuations. Too many people are treating this like a stock, and that's going to hurt the coins chances of gaining market acceptance.\n\nThere's a reason the price keeps dipping and vendors are hesitant to commit to accepting the coin as payment for goods and services. And that reason is people selling at every peak.",

If that resistance breaks, next hard support line is .35-.37. If that breaks, next support line looks like .297-.31. Below that, it looks like there are no hard support lines until way down at .16-.22.. Most of the rise in price came from major pumps and huge whales that couldn\u2019t care any less about HODLing than what they ate last month. It\u2019s all about profit margin requirements for them.  They are going to continue manipulating Cryoto prices like they have been manipulating GME, AMC, BB, NOKIA, etc.. because it seems like a quick money grab to make up what they lost on GME for them.

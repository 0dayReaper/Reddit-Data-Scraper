From what I read, it isn't particularly well architected, and they're taking advantage of the current near-zero fees (7/1000th's of a penny, or 7/100th's of a penny, nominal per kb)\n\nI'm not worried about them. The supporters of it will get bored and move on at some point, and if not, the fees will go up to a whopping 7/10ths of a penny or some such and shut it down.",

Then, hopefully, next time they'll be a little more chill about it.\n\nWe've all done it at some point and I assume that's how most people learn better. Plus, if you're panicking, you might just be playing with money you shouldn't be.\n\nWith any hope, crypto holders will learn to be better HODLers and everything will be just a tad bit more stable over time. Maybe. Probably not. But a man can dream :)",

YOU DO NOT own any Cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood and send it to your own wallet for example, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency.\n\nRobinhood has shown in the past that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.\n\nIf you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. You can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes you through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step. And answers most of the questions one might have in the beginning. The process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood.\n\nYou can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there.\n\nMore in-depth explanation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6i468/ditch_robinhood/",

You've got to price that in, too.\n\nI know someone will talk about market cap, but it doesn't make sense when a bunch of doge hodlers wouldn't sell at 1000 anyway. You would have to sell honda and use that cash to get their doge.\n\nAnything under 10 dollars is a steal.  If amazon and coinbase pick up, then we're looking at 10 dollar doge being a FAIR price.\n\nThere will be lots and lots of fluctuations in price along the way, but if there is just one more company like slimjim (made money cus of doge without buying doge) then you will see huge gains in doge's price.\n\nPeople that knock doge should answer one question, which one is better known across the planet? Doge? or your moonshot coin that just started 8 weeks ago? Brand name is king.",

I've pretty much got a handle on it already and I've only been doing this a couple of months, so give them a chance.  \n2. Really they're already punishing themselves by selling at a loss or a small profit then seeing the price rebound way higher than they expected.  \n3. They're not the problem. It's the whales dumping and basically bullying them into thinking that they have to cut their losses.  \nSo instead, I suggest we go easy on them, people make mistakes, commiserate with and advise them assuming they want to continue with Doge. After all, the more of us that are doing it right, the more we take from the whales. Who knows, maybe we can take enough that one of them vaguely notices..!",

            "comment": "Based on the fact that at each dip, doge seems to find a support point.  There is enough support and momentum to keep pushing this forward.  Also Elon is no fool, people have betted against him before and lost.  No other coin is getting as much coverage.  I am not stupid enough to think what is in it for him. But he also has a lot to loose  and I don't mean financially.  All he has to do is say he will accept it as payment for Tesla and that is another jump.   As I said I think it is only a matter of time for doge to get to $1 I remember people saying it will never get to .25 or .5.  I am not saying it is completely rational, but normal rules don't apply here.  When enough people get together with determination,  resilience and unity then anything is possible my friend.  What you see here is an example of people making collective decisions for the long term benefit of the mass. Where their is unity and passion here is power.",

Don't waste your life savings on any stock, there's always a chance it will crash, bad. If you won't get hurt by burning that amount of money, invest that instead.\n\n2. Never sell at a loss when you've bought in. You only ever lose when you actually sell at a loss. Keep holding and sell only when you gain a profit, hold if you believe it will go higher, that's why most people are here.\n\n3. Treat the market like a casino. This will give you an idea of the stakes. Never keep buying to make up for a loss, you're going to spiral into a gambling addiction. Back to tip #1, only invest money you can afford to lose. Don't invest money meant to go to your bills.",

You only have that much money if you cash out. 500,000 in crypto coin doesn't  pay your local dealership to buy a new car or pay your local builder to build you a brand new house. Just like the stock market people cash out that need the money. In crypto , it's got to be sold and changed back to your countries currency and then you can have your dream house or your new car. I would like to see doge get to $5, but along the way, sharks will take profits and protect themselves and reinvest or go buy what they always wanted.",

Many of you helped. Thank you! \n\n\nThere were many posts made by the community and they all have good information in them. Some of these posts have been kept up to date and they are below. \n\n___\n\n* [The Ultimate Simple Guide for Buying, Trading and Storing Dogecoin ](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/mso3z0/the_ultimate_simple_guide_for_buying_trading_and/)\n\n___\n\n\n* [How to buy Dogecoin in 5 easy steps in 5 easy hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7np1m/how_to_buy_dogecoin_in_5_easy_steps_in_5_easy/)\n\n___\n\n* [How to Buy/Own Dogecoin: Lowest fees](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/n0y13z/beginners_guide_how_to_buyown_dogecoin_with_the/)\n\n___\n\n* [How to buy Doge for in 5 eezy steps (FOR DUMDUMS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7nxxp/how_to_buy_doge_for_in_5_eezy_steps_for_dumdums/) \n\n___\n\n* [How to Purchase Dogecoin in 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7ok46/how_to_purchase_dogecoin_in_2021/) \n\n \n\n___\n\n* [HOW TO BUY DOGE COIN SO SIMPLE SUCH WOW](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7nzb5/how_to_buy_doge_coin_so_simple_such_wow/)\n\n___\n\n* [How to buy Cryptocurrency in an easy way and get some free money by my referral.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7po3q/for_beginner_how_to_buy_cryptocurrency_in_an_easy/)  \n\n___\n\n\n* [DOGECOIN - How to buy DOGE COIN with cheapest trading fee](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l88yrw/dogecoin_how_to_buy_doge_coin_with_cheapest/)\n\n___\n\n* [How to buy Dogecoin TODAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l82jfq/how_to_buy_dogecoin_today/)\n\n___\n\n* [How To Buy DOGECOIN (Simple &amp; Easy) UK,AUST,EUROPE,ASIA](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/lag3ig/how_to_buy_dogecoin_simple_easy_ukausteuropeasia/)\n\n___\n\nTo the moon!\n\nBonus message - I've allowed referral links to be used in these posts and links even though they are not allowed to be used generally in the subreddit. NEVER listen to financial advice from anyone other than a professional financial advisor! That includes on reddits posts and comments. \n\n---\n\nEdit: The posts above can be edited any time by the people who wrote them. If you feel there is a serious error or mistake please send modmail and I will remove the post and ask the OP to sort it out.\n\n---\n\nEdit Edit.. This post was refreshed in April 2021, June and November. Once a post gets a few months old and reddit stops comments. We can't have that! I have rearranged the posts above in order of the last time they were updated so the most updated posts are at the top.\n\nWARNING. Do NOT fall for hype. Don't think you're going to get instantly rich. Don't trust random people offering financial advice. Cryptocurrency is the wild wild west of investing and many people want to take your money and run. You must 'educated' yourself with the good and the bad. You must understand what you're doing.",

While the points above are useful, I'd just like to add a reminder for those reading the comments that it's also not really good practice to go around encouraging others to buy constantly with overconfident price predictions. Better to just let people form their own evaluations of whether they should put some money in or not. Some people out there will believe random posts like that and buy in with FOMO; they are vulnerable to being hurt. Do the right thing.  \n  \nThis message is not directed at the creators of this post, but people on this sub reading the comments who may be considering shilling",

While the points above are useful, I'd just like to add a reminder for those reading the comments that it's also not really good practice to go around encouraging others to buy constantly with overconfident price predictions. Better to just let people form their own evaluations of whether they should put some money in or not. Some people out there will believe random posts like that and buy in with FOMO; they are vulnerable to being hurt. Do the right thing.\n\nThis message is not directed at the creators of this post, but people on this sub reading the comments who may be considering shilling",

I am almost a dogecoin fan to say that, i am holding a very diversified coins and tokens not inclusive asset. \n\nThat's a good question which retains my attention. \n\nI joined recently, a new leading cryptocurrency Exchange platform BITAY, from Estonia but headquartered in Turkey. That Global exchange goal is not different from others to excite and contribute to cryptocurrency massive adoption worldwide meanwhile features aren't same. \n\n+700k KYCED users mainly Turkish are using it ok daily basis for trading activity. Almost same standard fee as other Exchanges however it offers a more Focused UI for Standard and professional traders.\n\nTrade any token at a Go! So fast and secured.

Is more about noise and you really cannot predict or follow analitical data about crypto. But still plp try to analize coins like companies and businesses... When u buy coins you should first know that money you dont need . You treat it like expense like you buy a toy or trip or what ever. Second if u really want profit the longer you hold the better. Third you just put money every now and then groing slow.",

You look at TA and cry why it doesn't work, when companies use it to determine the exact right moment to attack the price, so the prediction of TA no longer works out.\n\nAside from that, the assumption of a slowly growing market, as is happening in stocks, does not apply to crypto so volatility is a lot higher overall. In addition to that, each coin is traded on multiple markets, not only one official stock market. \n\nThere are similarities and differences between the two. It's wrong to say they are the same but it is also wrong to say that crypto is entirely different and no predictions can be made.\n\nyou just have to put in more work and correct for the manipulation that is present.\n\nLast two years the majority of money in crypto was from big corporations running algorithms. If you think small retail investors buying and selling affect anything here, it would explain why you are confused about the market.",

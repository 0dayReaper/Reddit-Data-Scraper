Probably won't be profitable unless your kw/h costs are .05 or less at the current price of DOGE, but you'll get a good idea where to go from there. The *Bitmain* L7 is the top dog(e)for scrypt atm, with approximately a $5,000.00usd(or less) price tag new.\n\nMining equipment is at a low($$) atm.\n\nEdit: LTC has its halving coming up around August 2nd.",

Of course you\u2019ll then have to exchange your coins for Doge, and that will expose you to the market.\n\nIf you pick up an old ASIC and join a merge-mining Litecoin pool, you might cover your electricity costs, maybe. But recovering the cost of the hardware is unlikely.",

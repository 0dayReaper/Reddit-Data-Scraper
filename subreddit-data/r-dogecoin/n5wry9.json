If my doge gets to $5k I can sell most of it and pay off a terrible loan I took out of desperation, and still hold a few for the good memories.\n\nWe lucked out. And I know when we recover from our situations, we won't forget where we came from. That's what separates us from communities. It's just a meme coin, but hey. Here we are. What a wonderful world.",

When I was younger I was in a similar situation to you and I took out a loan for a few thousand at around 8%\n\nIf you\u2019re paying 14%, you\u2019re only making in profit what your investments make above 14%, which in normal markets is quite a healthy return.\n\nEDIT: also look at balance transfers to a new card. A lot of cards companies where I live in the U.K. offer special (sometimes even zero) rates for balances transferred onto their card. There\u2019s usually a 2% transfer fee and you have to remember to move again before the offer expires.",

I have a 2012 Fiat that is totally paid off and only has 36,000 miles on it. I too paid off all my debt instead of buying a new car. It is the best feeling in the world being debt-free. You will not regret it! Our society is obsessed with staus, and you know what? A good percentage of the people driving high-end vehicles are leasing them because they can't afford to buy/own a high-end vehicle. And Leasing is an endless money pit. I know several incredibly wealthy individuals who only buy used cars even when they purchase luxury vehicles and hold on to them for a decade. Safety is important though, especially if you have kids. if you buy certified used you can get a lot more value for your money. I was tempted to buy an electric version of my car but I have been steadily buying more Doge. I am steadily reaching the 100,000.00 mark and REALLY glad I kept my car! Good luck paying down your debt and it is good advice to switch cards for a lower interest rate or a loan. If you are really buried in debt there are companies that work to get you debt at a lower or no interest. They can even negotiate what you owe but it will negatively impact your credit for 7 yrs.",

            "comment": "\\*Spoiler Alert: Much Wow. So Wisdom. Just Hodl.\\*\n\nThere are plenty of financially secure people out there who want to help unfortunate people out with their extra wealth but do not know the best way how. Well here is a great idea: investing in Doge is a philanthropic and spiritually nurturing act. You can free millions of people from their struggles by buying in big to help build the future floors of Doge on its rise to the moon. It is as beneficial as any charitable gesture. \n\nWant to do even more good? If you own a business then start accepting Doge and be part of the leaders of a righteous revolution. You will be helping people who want to help themselves and who believe in Doing Only Good Everyday. They in turn will pay off their credit debts, student loans, medical expenses, child support, mortgages, etc., which means more money back into the economy, or basically a people-driven stimulus plan without the help of an already over-burdened government. \n\nThis will bring so much relief and cause a ripple effect of better mental health that people will pay forward by spreading more positivity in a troubled society where media seems to only report sadder and sadder news each day. This is how we can help heal humanity, through this dynamic wonder coin called Doge, the true gift in all of crypto. \n\nEverybody knows that wealth will not travel with you after your spirit departs this realm, but you can leave behind a legacy that enriches many generations to come and in the same process add profound meaning to your existence. God loves benefactors because God is the ultimate one, so love yourself by loving others. Buy Doge. Give Joy. Spread Love. \n\nTo the Moon, and then to Heaven...",

And all of a sudden \uff44\uff4f\uff47\uff45 came up. I sold a little bit early on during the rise, enough to pay off my credit card debt and keep myself alive for the next few months (living extremely frugally, only the basics, using coupons and sales everywhere).\n\nSo thank you \uff44\uff4f\uff47\uff45 for giving me back a bit of my dignity.\n\nI have a few \uff44\uff4f\uff47\uff45 left that I will HODL and remember how it saved me from a very dark time. \n\nThank you dogecoin.",

I have actually purchased over 20k in Doge and with my earnings I have received over 250k in Doge, spent over 100k in doge and send Doge back and forth between my wallets. \n\nFinding ways to increase holdings and spend on a regular basis expands it's utility and therefore increases it's viability and stability. \n\n![gif](giphy|qrwthQPPQrtEk)\n\nStill increasing my actual amount in a \"Hodl\" wallet for the future MOON TRIP...",

Trading it every day does not increase its value. \n\nValue is noted by how much of the market is captured. \n\nIf no one was holding doge it would be worth 0$s (, even if people were buying it and dumping / trading it. ) \n\nIt's the people who have like a lot of doge and have been holding it who actually make doge worth anything. \n\nThe more people who hold the more stable the market is. The more yall sell the less it worth. \n\nDon't buy coins and try to flip them real fast. You're fking the market up and you're only going to cause your coins to devalue. \n\nThis is why I like other coins better. Doge is traded so much its worthless.",

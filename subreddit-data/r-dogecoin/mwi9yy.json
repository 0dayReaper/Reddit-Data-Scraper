Right now there are way too many people looking at Doge like it's a way to become an overnight millionaire.\n\nDo people really think Doge should have a higher market cap than major corporations like Ford? The F-150 is the most popular vehicle in the US. That is tangible. Brand loyalty, market share, and physical assets. People aren't going to stop buying trucks tomorrow. They sell thousands every day, and they have for decades.\n\nThe only way Doge goes to the moon is ever increasing numbers of people dump money in. Despite the wild popularity lately, the money spigot dries up eventually. Becomes a pyramid scheme, a casino. The chumps buy in high while the high rollers cash out. People get the next hot tip and hit the fire exits. \n\nCrypto, especially Doge, should only be purchased for fun and the community around it. If it makes some money, that's cool. Expecting to get rich by next week is a fool's game. Buy lotto tickets if that's your goal.",

As long as it never tanks and gets wiped off the map. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nEdit: So, studied and read some overnight. I still think Doge will still hold a reasonable value down the road. Currently, this is a pump and dump scheme on the grandest of scales attached to a previously obscure crypto despite the popular meme. I say obscure because it was in the top 30 and went to top 10 cryptos overnight thanks to Elon! HODL will still make you money in the end. It just takes longer. The coin will be pushed by celebrities and gain acceptance over time. The P&amp;D method isn't for the faint of heart. It's a scary rollercoaster ride. Just don't cash out and walk away once you see your investment shrink. It eventually will, but then it spikes. Look for the pattern. It keeps repeating.....at least for a while. It won't last forever though. If the big whales stop swimming,.......just saying, be careful and smart!",

I missed the 0.155, tonight.) That's when you buy what you can afford or accept to lose, wait, even for yrs possibly, and make your bank along the way. Don't sell folks. We could be kicking ourselves like you wouldn't believe, later. Imagine people that bailed on Bitcoin without waiting yrs for it to go to $60,000?  Relatively, that's not very long, staggeringly amazing, actually! Still DOGE is no Bitcoin due to limitations and the way it was designed, unlimited mining supply, market cap etc......BUT BUT BUT....the potential DOGE has could still bring the same type of reward given a few more yrs or so. Never know but selling now is probably not a good idea. Please don't spend more than your lifestyle can afford. Be patient. It could always crash back to almost worthless. Then buy a bunch cheap. This will take time. Try not to buckle. HODL!",

                    "comment": "Do not, and I repeat, **do not** listen to the morons telling you to buy tomorrow. That is an incredibly dumb decision. \nThere is a massive, MASSIVE amount of uncertainty, fear, and doubt in the overall market right now. Not only will this affect just about every stock you own, but it will also affect crypto. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m going to waste my time explaining this, honestly, it\u2019s only because I\u2019m trying to kill time until the new episode of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier comes out. \n\nBut, let\u2019s look at Dogecoin in general. It is a meme stock whether you want to believe or not. It\u2019s gonna be the first crypto everyone sells. They\u2019re going to sell it before they sell Bitcoin, ethereum, even Cardano. Why? Because these cryptos gained their value not through a loving and loyal community (and don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the doge community and their loyalty), but by building an incredibly reliable and intelligent infrastructure to produce longevity.  They are far more secure than a crypto that relies on hype and loyalty. And unfortunately, that\u2019s all dogecoin is. \n\nI\u2019m not saying never buy dogecoin again, I would be a fool to say so. What I\u2019m saying is, well first, don\u2019t throw all your money at it at once, scale in, bc if you don\u2019t you\u2019re a poor trader and will be left with maximized LOSSES instead of potential GAINS. As I said, dogecoin is the most uncertain crypto on the market right now, the most volatile, it will be the first to leave the majority of buyers portfolios. You are going to see far better deals in the coming weeks where you can better utilize your $1k on. \n\nEven if crypto was a stable, secure crypto like Bitcoin, I would still say hold off. Because what is happening has nothing to do with the coin itself, but the overall panic the economy and market is seeing right now with the hike in capital gains tax. Those with the most money, the most shares and coins, are going to sell everything now to avoid this tax and to indulge in their panic and paper hands. \n\nSo just chill out and wait to enter, because it is almost fact that if you buy now, you will see major losses before slight gains, and if instead you wait, you will see major gains and only slight losses.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take my advice, but I can guarantee you I\u2019ve done more day-to-day research of market conditions than these dummies saying \u201cdo it bro! Doge to the moon!!!\u201d, and unfortunately, you will see I\u2019m right after the fact and regret not listening to me.\n\nDoge will never return back to .05, I think it will always maintain .10+ from this point forward. But the level it\u2019s at now is not a support level, and with the absolute panic and uncertainty of the market, we will see it fall more before it rises. Be wise, be patient, and maximize your gains by buying the best deal.",

I'm genuinely worried for some people in these threads, idk if they just never zoomed back on the chart, or got caught up in the hopium, but there could be a lot of pain in the next few months as the big money cashes out before the capital gains tax hits.\n\nNot that they'll listen most likely, but at least you tried.",

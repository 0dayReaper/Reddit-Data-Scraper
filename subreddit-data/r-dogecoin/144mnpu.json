If one believes that cryptocurrencies are the future of the world\u2019s monetary system, do not lose focus because individuals are putting you down, keep on going, educate, explain the benefits of this new technology and how it can make the lives of billions better.\n\nChanges come slowly because people (usually the wealthy) are satisfied with the status quo. Dogecoin can make a difference, help create a level playing field where all have an equal opportunity to succeed.",

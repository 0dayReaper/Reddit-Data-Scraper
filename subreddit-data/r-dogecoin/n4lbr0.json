You could average in, like buy more each time it moves a couple cents up.  [ edit:  I couldn't believe the up votes.  My phone's been going crazy.  I must have struck a nerve.  A lot of us have tried to time and would have been better off just hodling.  And save capital gains.  Looking to try to use as currency, then price will go higher bc institutions will want to get in on profits.]",

But they already have been doing that about doge for a month and we aren\u2019t even 1/10th the size yet!\n\nLastly, value is determined by supply and demand\u2026 technically there is no ceiling!",

It's already increased massively though and at some point will crash along with everything else. The good news is it's now mainstream enough that it likely won't go anywhere and will likely have a solid run in the next bull market as well. Of course at some point we may hit the golden bull run and the old cycles will break as retail and institutional reach critical mass. We are getting close but I'm guessing it will not be until at least the next bull if not the one after that.",

In other words earning or losing that much money won't make or break me but if it does end up becoming something bigger, that will certainly improve my lifestyle. But for someone who is in dire need of money, even a little bit of $$ gain is a blessing. So, please decide on a rational basis, not emotional.\n\nIn my humble opinion for Doge to become big and stable, two things need to happen:\n\n1.It needs a cap. An unlimited supply will eventually drive the price down when the hype dies.\n\n2. Doge needs to become a legit platform for making business transactions. Without widespread usability and lack of mainstream application, Doge will not hold it's charm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am illiterate when it comes to investing and crypto but I joined reddit today to learn from y'all.

I know what being a shibe means to me. What does it mean to you? Your answer won't be wrong, it is simply your own. Take pride in your own answers. They may make you, as well as break you.\nTruly ask yourself what being a holder of Doge, and there-for a fellow Shibe, means to you.\n\nI'll tell you what it means to me.\n\nI'm a D.O.G.E S.H.I.B.E\nDoing Only Good Everyday as a Spiritually Heightened Individual Being of Existence.\n\nHow many commentative responses will be positive? How many will be negative? That is for you the individual person to find out through your own action of seeking an answer from within.\n\nMy own answer is but one of many possible.\nNone wrong.\nNone right.\nJust acceptance that it is our own.\n\nWhat does being a Doge Shibe make YOU?",

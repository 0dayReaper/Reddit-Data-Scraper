Yes hold some just like you try to keep a stack of fiat money in your bank account, but use it aswell to encourage it's use and then the price hikes.\n\nIts like holding on to your USD in bank and not spending it because it could go up in value (and it does everyday, ups and down like any other currency) thats why here in Canada we have tourists from the US using their buying power. Or say a Canadian going to Thailand and what is 3000$ back home feels like 10 000$ in Thailand.",

In fact as the dollar loses value we could actually see Doge hit 100\u2019s of dollars granted it will be against a weakening dollar. I am treating Doge like my survive the dollar collapse hedge against terrible inflation. I won\u2019t sell a single coin at $1. Not even $10. We live in unprecedented times and Doge is a lifeline for those of us that seize on it and Diamond hand it through the worst of what\u2019s to come. This is not financial advice.",

The reality is most of us are small time investors that have somewhere between a few hundred and few thousand dollars in doge. I have exactly 561 doge with is valued at like $350 at the time of writing. I think this represents the typical person here more so than the people who have like 15,000 doge or whatever.",

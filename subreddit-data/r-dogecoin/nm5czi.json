Then when they are .10 - .50 your investment has ballooned. It\u2019s much easier for a fraction of a penny coin to turn into a ten cent coin than a 30 cent coin turn into a few dollars",

And how majority of the momentum has gone, people's life savings are in it, the coin and market are in a state where new investors aren't willing to believe in this sure-fire dream. \n\nDoge got me interested in crypto. I made my gains on it. Moved on. \"Lost\" it in the crash. Such is life. But I've got to learn about the \"fundamentals\" behind coins and what drives their price, what coins are and what a blockchain actually is. Understanding why different coins and platforms exist and what purpose they all serve and how they can integrate with eachother. Why BTC is considered a store of value and why dogecoin is by design made to go down in price. \n\nBut hey ho, if you post anything other than rocket emojis and stroke Elons ego you just get downvoted.",

The upgrade will also ensure that wallet backups are valid forever, and will make it easier for service providers to integrate Dogecoin.\n\nCoinbase announced it will finally list Dogecoin, after much prevarication. The six-to-eight-week timeline shared by the exchange suggests that the new upgrade could be ready by the listing. \n\nThe team\u2019s next goal is to cut transaction fees from their current average of $0.4 to $0.01. \u201cIt's going to be a bit of a negotiation with the miners. But we have to convince them that it's healthy for the network,\u201d",

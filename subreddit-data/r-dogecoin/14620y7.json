Not sure if its satire or not but hopefully some helpful folks will comment. i see the price dropped from 8 to 5 cents and id like to buy however i have no idea what site is best to purchase from. please help\u2764\ufe0f",

Some exchanges require you to hold them until the payment has settled, so pick that wisely. \n\nWhen the purchase is done, move them into a wallet that only you have the keys for, preferably a cold-wallet, which can be a simple text-file or print-out. (search for text-wallet in sub to learn more)\n\nCommon recommendations for exchanges would be binance or coinbase, but they are currently having some SEC issues. Kraken also has a very good reputation in the crypto community. Crypto(.)com has high fees and Robinhood gives you worse buying and selling prices, so they can take a cut from your purchase and might mess with your buy-price for tax purposes.",

All around not being able to do anything on Coinbase, send, bridge, stake, move, cash out. Payment methods blocked, accounts blocked. No customer support worth listening to. Plus they are getting sued by the SEC (all news on here about it) Binance also in all sorts of trouble with the SEC. Take diligence when choosing.",

They can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes them through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step. The process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood. :)\n\nYou're not actually buying a cryptocurrency when you buy on Robinhood, but an \u201dIOU\u201d. And a number of users across social media and here on reddit have reported being unable to buy or sell their Dogecoin on Robinhood due to constant blackouts/interruptions in service as soon as the price starts seeing some movement.\n\nThis is eerily similar to the incident where users weren\u2019t able to buy Gamestop stock. You cannot transfer or withdraw your Dogecoin either, . So you cannot move it to your own wallet or transfer it somewhere else if you wanted to.",

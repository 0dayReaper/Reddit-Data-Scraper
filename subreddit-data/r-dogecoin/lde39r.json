If there's something planned for the Super Bowl like an actual ad or something I feel like it's probably going to tank at some time between now and then so whoever took out the ad can buy a ton before it happens and ride the spike after.\n\nThis is all speculation so who really knows.",

It might be a conspiracy theory, but posts like that one might very well be used to make people move their funds from Doge to BTC, for example. I find that post very suspicious, at the very least. What it describes could very well happen, but it could happen and it does happen with any crypto or stock or volatile asset.\n\nThere has always been a bit of venom against Dogecoin in the \"mainstream\" crypto communities, almost a lingering irritation about the fact we were more welcoming and we were having more fun. They complain about Doge being used just to pump and dump - I wonder if they looked at what is happening around Bitcoin in these days.\n\nBy the amount of subscribers that joined this community due to recent events I no longer know who would doubt the relevance of Doge, also to introduce new people to cryptos in general.\n\nThe \"seriousness\" around Bitcoin made some people rich, but is turning Bitcoin into a safe-haven asset for storage like gold, instead than into a currency for everyday use. Doge can really be something much more fungible than Bitcoin and more demystifying, if we keep going like this.\n\nAs I wrote in another thread, 13 years of Bitcoin, the principal and original cryptocurrency, have done very little to build awareness about the benefits of cryptocurrencies. Why? It almost sounds like the general tendency of many people around it was just to get rich, instead of building value for people not yet into it.\n\nCryptos can and should co-exist, especially if you do not focus on pumping and dumping your currency of choice all the time for a fast profit.",

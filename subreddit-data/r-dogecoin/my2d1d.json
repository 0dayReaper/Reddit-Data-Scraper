Sporklin always seemed like someone who was larger than life to me, especially in the early days of the Dogecoin community.

Of that there was never any doubt.\n\nA true and ardent Shibe, defender of Dogecoin and relentlessly bitey to those who would dare try to harm it, Sporklin did not back down - especially if she saw someone out there spreading misinformation. God, I pity the fools who incurred the wrath of Sporklin.\n\nBut the truth is that she was a very necessary part of this community, someone willing to not just stand up for us but get involved at the highest levels to make sure that Dogecoin survived and thrived.\n\nShe was tough, she was strong and she cared a whole hell of a lot, more than most of us will ever know.\n\nPouring out something pink and sparkly on her behalf today.\n\nRIP, Spork. \n\nThank you for having our backs all of these years.",

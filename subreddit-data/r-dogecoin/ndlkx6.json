Maybe like a hobby/side job will hold doge after a sale.\n\nUnless the sales of doge and other crypto can be totally pulled from the profit side of business and seen as investment of profits. They need to be converted to fiat.",

We accepted BTC a few years ago and it was such a tiny part of sales that we could keep it as BTC without any real impact on cashflow. We held and it returned a high yield. We wouldn't go for 100% just because we need cashflow but that is very unlikely to happen. If the vast majority of our customers were using crypto then it's gone mainstream and everybody is accepting it including our landlords.\n\nBeing small gives us the advantage of being able to adapt quickly. We can start taking a crypto within a few hours, and stop if it tanks within minutes. There's no layers of decisions to go through, just my husband and I. I'm the tech person. A few days ago we chatted about Doge as we'd been watching it rise and I had it available as a payment option an hour or so later.  \n\nEdit: typo",

I have a fair amount invested in Doge.  As a business, it strikes me that if I can transact some level of my business through Doge every year, it only goes to help build Doge as a viable currency and it's good for my investment I've already made in it, as well as good for this whole terrific community.  So... ya, anyone who has a business, this is an important step with Doge.  It's really the only step needed to really really make it a mainstream thing.  The part I've wondered as a business is.... most businesses have some level of money in the bank, if nothing else padding for a recession, just like many people do with their personal finances.  This might be like 1-12 months worth of expenses.  Why do we store this in the bank when we could be storing in another currency such as Doge and pull it out and exchange it for dollar as needed?  It's very likely to appreciate whereas the dollar... you knowingly lose out on inflation.  Money stored in Doge for 6 months... seems likely to double.  Trying to convince the wife on this, but she's scared of a crash and such... which is a valid concern... but it still seems kinda crazy to me that we do our financing through a bank instead of just investing in appreciating currency and siphon out as desired.  Anyone else thought of this?",

I\u2019m not going to argue that their economies of scale make it very hard to compete with their pricing, but they help many, many small businesses reach new markets. Small businesses that work with Amazon, which is the key, tend to support the company. Those that compete, however, likely will not fair as well. \n\nGood read here: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brockblake/2019/09/23/amazon-friend-or-foe\n\nJust some food for thought.\n\n(Edit: spelling)",

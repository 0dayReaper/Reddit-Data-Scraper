You\u2019re just going to need to use more DOGE to get tickets from Cuban. It\u2019s still has to match the dollar amount. There\u2019s not enough people to flip the script. The only people that are crypto millionaires or ever will be from DOGE are ones who bought a crazy amount pre 10 cents. Even that is only a 500% profit which is why I say they would have had to buy 1 million Doge which would have been around 200k at 10 cents. You MIGHT get a double up if you invest in the .40s. I don\u2019t understand the logic. Again even if millions are buying Doge using it and putting more in, the whales are just going to use that to their advantage. There is literally a coin that is usable in it\u2019s own video game. Decentraland/Mana. It\u2019s a community game where are you can use your Mana to buy essentially anything (pizza,gambling,NFTs and streaming services) NPCs have been replaced with actual people who get paid in Mana to be a tour guide in game. It is the same concept people keep talking about with \u201chodl\u201d and \u201cspend doge on doge companies\u201d except it\u2019s actually been thought out and doesn\u2019t have unlimited supply. If you are new and think the arguments people are making for DOGE are strong I really urge you to look at the other coins. You will see virtually everyone of them is up 10,000% in short time. Doge isn\u2019t special for going from 0.05 to 0.50. It\u2019s not the first and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. It is the first crypto that is checking all the boxes to actually pop. People always talk about crypto crashing and while it goes down a lot none have failed. I would say DOGE got a couple months and you guys need the whales for that to happen. They need to pump it up and then maybe you guys will get out with minimal loss or decent gain. I\u2019m telling you now though when you see a go back up to $0.60- $.70 that does not mean DOGE bounced back and there is a new \u201cfloor\u201d that is a very risky assumption and honestly anybody that uses the word floor in crypto lacks the most basic comprehension on how crypto and money works",

And even more confused why he would tell people how to interpret the word \"hustle.\"\n\nThat was it too. After that one line, he was gone. Then the news host said something like \"wow, can't understand why people would get into something like that,\" and it went back to non-doge news. It really makes you think about how much the news you listen to glosses over all context with any story.",

It\u2019s easy for people to make narratives on what is affecting the value. People talking about whales and patterns and blaming things- the fact is the coin needs to continue to be adopted by significant retailers. The only thing stopping people from selling(and mind you, a lot of people bought at $.05 or even lower and can make life changing money at $1) is if people have things to spend Dogecoin on, if they pressure RH to announce their current developments on wallets, and figure out what\u2019s going to happen if this coin were to actually stabilize around $1-$1.50.\n\nEverything else is a greater fool theory. Everyone that buys causes someone that wants to sell.",

YOU DO NOT own any Cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood and send it to your own wallet for example, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency.\n\nRobinhood has shown in the past that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.\n\nIf you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. You can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes you through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step. And answers most of the questions one might have in the beginning. The process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood.\n\nYou can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there.\n\nMore in-depth explanation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6i468/ditch_robinhood/",

The few sketches he had about doge were fine. The one on the Michael Che bit he was trying to explain what doge was and Michael Che asked \" so it's a hustle? And Elon replied \" well yes\". That was the end of the skit. So not sure what everyone else's definition of \"hustle\" I'd but I heard no negative connotation. I've seen nothing but negative articles exaggerating the skit and I never heard him calling it a scam. If people sold in a panic after whales sold I don't think it's based on the skit.  That s just my opinion though.",

That\u2019s 14 million new coins added to the supply every day, which adds up to about 1 billion coins added every eighty days. Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins. So, Dogecoin mints more coins every two days than Bitcoin will ever have in circulation. That\u2019s why doge will never be priced like Bitcoin. And, in fact, at about $9 per Dogecoin, Dogecoin would equal Bitcoin in value. Dogecoin has no real ecosystem to make it valuable. It is not fast: 33 transactions per second. ETH 2.0 can handle 100,000 per second. So Dogecoin can\u2019t serve as a currency. It seems to have minimum dev work. And it\u2019s fueled by people who think they are getting into doge early. If you buy now, you are not. Dogecoin is not the future of anything. With Dogecoin, you are buying hype. And hype might push Dogecoin to 69 cents. Maybe to $1...but there is zero reason for doge to hold And hype might push Dogecoin to 69 cents. Maybe to $1...but there is zero reason for doge to hold that value. In fact, at $1 per Dogecoin, with 1 billion coins added every 80 days, doge would need $1 billion in new investment every few months JUST TO MAINTAIN $1.00 Also, be aware that $129 billion (doge at $1) is a huge market cap. That\u2019s the same value as STARBUCKS. And doge has almost zero use-case scenarios. Sure you can buy some Mavs merch. Maybe find some occasional doge fans that accept it as payment. But doge can\u2019t scale to be a currency. It\u2019s too slow. Doge, frankly, is way overpriced right now. And Doge is going to have trouble maintaining it\u2019s value due to its always-expanding supply. If the hype falls off just a bit\u2014doge will fall, too. And twitter\u2019s algorithm is heavily weighted against repeat trends. You might make money with doge, but it is far from guaranteed, and there is a fairly hard ceiling due to doge\u2019s constant supply. If you buy doge, you are buying hype and Elon Musk tweet energy and nothing else. Be careful.\"",

                    "comment": "HOW MARKET CAP (ACTUALLY) WORKS\n\nI keep seeing a lot of posts here talking about market cap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to clear up some misconceptions and explain market cap works and what it actually means.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMC (Market Cap) = P (Price) x S (Supply)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMarket cap just means how much the total supply is \u201cvalued/worth\u201d at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $6 billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHAT\u2019S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap. The only two variables that change the market cap are price. And supply nothing else can change the market cap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupply is determined by mining. Current supply is 128 billion Dogecoin (rounded down). With 5.26 billion added per year. This means if the price remains constant then the market cap will increase every year with 0 (zero) new money entering the system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrice is determined by supply and demand. If demand increases and people are willing to pay more for Dogecoin then the price increases. Again the amount of money added to the system does not determine the price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Dogecoin went from .01 to .05 in a day that does not mean that $5 billion was added. It just means that the demand changed and therefore the price changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDogecoin can still reach $1 dollars, but it doesn\u2019t mean that $128 billion dollars are needed to do it. The $128 billion dollars is just how much the total supply is \u201cworth\u201d at $1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo people may be asking how does Dogecoin increase in price then?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market. That\u2019s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn\u2019t just one person. It\u2019s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers \u201cvalue\u201d Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that\u2019s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. It legitimatizes Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency in general when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best way to change price of Dogecoin is by more people wanting to buy or hold than there are people who want to sell, or through giving dogecoin utility by exchanging Dogecoin for goods and services.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to clear this misconception up. If anyone has any questions feel free to reach out to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: This does not mean I support adding a cap to the supply The Dogecoin developers are NOT adding a supply cap and it will actually be less beneficial for the currency. The best way to increase the value of Dogecoin is through increased demand and utility\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks guys and remember 1 doge = 1 doge",

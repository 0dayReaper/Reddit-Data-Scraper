You really need to spend your time in r/CryptoCurrency  ...they'll love you over there. /s\n\nIt's too bad you don't actually have anything constructive to say here, cause it's obvious that you're decently clever. You could be a force for good.  We actually have a lot of traders in this sub that are helpful, and not condescending assholes.  Some people in here are open to the idea of trading.\n\nBut all you do is jump on every \"woe's me\" post.  If you can't accept the fact that the core of crypto is a hodl mentality, and respectfully provide alternatives for those who might want trade, I don't think you have a place in the community.",

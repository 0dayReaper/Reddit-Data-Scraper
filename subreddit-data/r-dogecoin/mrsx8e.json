The cheapest price point in the last 5 years was $50, meaning you put down at minimum $13,000.\n\nNobody with that kind of disposable income is broke. You might be the \"I own a middle class home, and a new car, but my checking account is small\" kind of broke, but not actually broke.\n\nAlso i hope you are putting some money away for that 15% tax bill.",

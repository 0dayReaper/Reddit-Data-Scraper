If it keeps going then congrats partials make it too. I guess you don't really sell until your done with the asset completely and go somewhere else",

But some people do pretty good with trading.  I think for myself, a hybrid of the two, concerning doge because I like the project.  A big ole bag for hodling.  And a more modest bag for trading.",

Others play for long term gains. Some do both. Some do neither.",

Find the leanest, cheapest cut of meat at your supermarket, London broil or something. Freezer for a half hour to firm it up, then cut against the grain in quarter-inch ish strips. Put your slices in a big bowl of 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce, some honey, molasses, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, red pepper flakes, dash of pepper, little bit of liquid smoke of your choice. Leave in the fridge over night. In the morning, take each strip and dry it on a paper towel - get it real dry, the flavor sticks on I promise. Lay them out not touching on a big rimmed pan and throw them in the oven low and slow at 170 degrees for like 5 ish hours, flipping occasionally. If they leak some juices pour that out and throw em back in. Once it all looks like jerky instead of steak they'll be good to eat, and last two to three weeks in a sealed container at room temperature, longer in the fridge and indefinitely in the freezer. Tastes better than store bought by a mile.\n\n\nOh, and also doge to the moon, position 16k",

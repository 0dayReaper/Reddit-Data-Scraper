The very wealthy can\u2019t control Crypto like the stock market and the middle class made money on it before the very wealthy could.  Even though the wealthy did get in but probably lost money in there portfolios with crypto investment.   The SEC want to make Crypto elitist like the stock market price out the middle.  There\u2019s really no reason for the SEC to care about Crypto only for the money that\u2019s in it and rich portfolio losses.",

Binance is ignoring securities laws and the CEO has said publicly that US laws don\u2019t apply to him or his exchange even though they do business in the US. That is why the SEC is suing. \n\nThis is what crypto regulation is going to look like. The SEC will sue and freeze assets until these exchanges comply with the law. The alternative to letting exchanges do sketchy things is more FTX like collapses. \n\nExchanges need to be regulated. Imagine if banks were run like a cryptocurrency exchange\u2026one day the CEO of the bank just takes all your money\u2026poof gone and no laws to stop them. That\u2019s not good for the future of crypto and these exchanges need to be spanked.",

Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and many other exchanges have been pleading with the US government for at least 2 years to clarify its rules on crypto.  The US response has been say \"no\" and then make arbitrary enforcement actions.  \n\nCoinbase is reportedly now considering relocation out of the US because they can't get a straight answer from the SEC.  Kraken has shut down its entire US crypto staking program because of whimsical SEC actions.  Even if the SEC doesn't get its freeze order, then Binance is likely going to shut down in the US because no one can operate under constant threat like this.  And the end result . . . the US government is eliminating competition for its own digital currency coming in July.  The US CBDC will be rolled out July 1 for its first phase (interbank trading)",

The real goal of the US government is to eliminate crypto, so the US government can roll out its own digital dollar unopposed.  The US CBDC is coming with phase one on July 1 this year, so its no coincidence the US is going after the biggest coin exchanges (Binance and Coinbase) right now.  That's my view at least.",

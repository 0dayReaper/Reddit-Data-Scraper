Not only have I learned the trends better this way but I\u2019m understanding different blockchains. I think rather than just putting everything into DOGE people should split it up with at least 3 alt coins because odds are 1 out of every 3 alts will be worth 50x before too long. ETH isn\u2019t an alt in my opinion but people thought bit coin peaked around 10k and stopped getting in. I feel like people are taking the same approach with ETH now. As if 4K is anywhere near where ETH will peak. I see it over 10k within 12 months. I also see it closing the margins on BTC. Right now around 14 Ether gets you 1 BTC. I believe it\u2019ll be about 10 for 1 by December",

The higher DOGE gets the lower the dollar is actually getting. The elitists are putting everything into certain stocks and crypto. Stocks is obvious. TSMC(who produces IPhone chips struggling yet Apple always up. CNN having great year despite worst ratings ever. Coke being up big in stocks as the sales plunge to decade lows and 62% of consumers are not doing business with coke after the \u201cdiversity training\u201d etc. my point is, anything but the dollar is a good investment. Stocks are manipulated. Crypto is too but I\u2019d suggest getting 3 alt coins or tokens. Odds are at least 1 will moonshot. Even if you insist on putting all you have in Doge, I\u2019d have a backup coin. I personally love Ethereum. Not classic just Ethereum. It\u2019s trending around the point BTC was when it was around 1,500 for a BTC. The 4K it just hit is making people think they\u2019re too late. You\u2019re not. The 3 I\u2019d recommend besides Doge are Mana,Ethereum and Vechain. I\u2019m not trying to push other coins. I have nothing to gain. Just with the dollar tanking, it\u2019s good to start really looking at cryptos and why they would be legitimate competition to BTC. Mana is by far the most advanced and unique in my opinion. Doge has the strongest and most in sync army. Ethereum is the only coin with a mathematical and logical chance to actually pass BTC in the future. That\u2019s my argument for those 3 coins. Vechain i know little about but a friend that I talk Crypto with made about seven predictions last year that all came true. He called Vechain at 0.03 because he looked into the coin. It\u2019s now 0.23 and he sees it hitting $1.00. Typically the coin outperforms his target so probably 400% profit is the least I expect from it.",

YOU DO NOT own any Cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood and send it to your own wallet for example, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency.\n\nRobinhood has shown in the past that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.\n\nIf you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. You can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes you through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step. And answers most of the questions one might have in the beginning. The process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood.\n\nYou can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there.\n\nMore in-depth explanation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6i468/ditch_robinhood/",

There are so many ways to properly invest money and produce safe year after year returns. You can take just a couple million and make a reliable $100,000 a year on interest, don't overspend, anything left over goes on top of the principal to help make more the next year. It's that simple. It's not much compared to really rich people but come on its a solid foundation. These people that win 100 million lotteries and back to square one are insane, that's like 5mil a year in returns how do they not just talk to a financial advisor and set themselves up",

I think it's honestly why rich people congregate and seem to actively keep the other classes down.  It really may be more fear of being take advantage of then actually not wanting to see other succeed.   I may be totally off but also we just don't teach everyone how to handle finances, learning curve is rough.",

They say they are working towards fixing this but who knows when. If Im wrong in anyways please let me know as Im new to the whole platform myself and choose Robinhood as my goto for doge (bought $100 at $0.20 a few weeks ago, currently at 400 dogeys myself). Id love to beable to sell and put the money back into my own personal bank without it being held for ransom",

I hate when someone posts a CAR that they bought with their DOGE, a CAR!!??!?!? It shows you that most people on here are kids, but good for them though. They will dump the money right back into the economy. It will help, but they should keep it private, its upsetting to some or a lot when they see some nerd bought all this stock and they will be creepy millionaires. Strange planet man.",

Dogecoin will certainly make some people a lot of money, but you must accept that there must be people who lose that money to the winners.. in order for you to sell your dogecoin, someone must buy it. Someone is eventually left holding the bag once no one will pay the asking price.\n\nBy nature, the notion that everyone investing in this coin will become a millionaire, or more specifically wealthy/rich relative to others, is ludicrous. There will be winners and losers. If you accept that, then go ahead and enjoy the ride.\n\nI genuinely have concern for investors in this coin because I think there is a fundamental lack of understanding in the market. I get it - dogecoin is defying all logic now and who knows what will come.. I am by no means a genius when it comes to investing but if you want, I could give you some of my own tips/perspective of the crypto market.",

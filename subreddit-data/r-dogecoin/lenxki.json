If the hotel is $100 a night that could be 1,000 doge one night and 10,000 the next. Does the hotel immediately convert doge to dollars, or do they hold it?\n\nEveryone says that doge needs to be circulated to increase in value, but I feel like that sort of deflation would prevent it from being used, otherwise it would need to be stable in value and then none of us make any money from holding, it\u2019s just another stable crypto with no investment value.",

Tons of rising attention on dogecoin means the hotel doing this now will bring the hotel a lot more attention which is positive. This is already working by evidence of the fact that we're talking about this hotel right now.\n\nAdditionally though, there *likely* isn't that much risk with the hotel accepting dogecoin. How many people are going to pay for their hotel stay in dogecoin? A few dozen maybe? If the value of dogecoin goes to 0, then at worst the hotel lost revenue from a few dozen reservations. What if there are hundreds or thousands of people using dogecoin to pay for their hotel stay? If that were the case, that would be an indicator that dogecoin is becoming widely accepted for use and it's value will definitely increase, in which case it would be good to transact and hold in dogecoin.\n\nMy guess would be that whatever dogecoin revenue the hotel receives from customers they'll hold onto rather than convert into dollars. If the coin goes up, great, their bet paid off! If not, then they probably lost an inconsequential amount of money and still got some great marketing out of it.",

You hold your doge bank and pay in doge too",

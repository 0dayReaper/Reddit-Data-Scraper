Exchanges have been doing really shady stuff with investors assets and the SEC is trying to impose restrictions and regulations to protect investors by making exchanges and their in house tokens more transparent. One way to go about this is to list some tokens as securities. Dogecoin is not considered a security by SEC. It would be considered the same as bitcoin or eth \u2026 a commodity. \n\nHere is a full list of tokens they have deemed securities,\n\nhttps://beincrypto.com/full-list-cryptos-securities-sec-lawsuit-binance-coinbase/",

They are moving out of fear that crypto will be extreme competition to the us dollar and will allow citizens to easily move their value out of the dollar in an instant.\n\nAddition: The SEC isn't trying to regulate anything. if they did, we would have clear regulation, and these lawsuits wouldn't be happening. Instead, they choose to ignore companies asking for clarity and discussion and follow up by hitting them with lawsuits. It's malicious and NOT in retail investors' best interest. I think that is blatantly obvious and thinking the SEC attacking coinbase is for our best interest is completely delusional.\n\n\nI'm having a really hard time understanding why a crypto subreddit has a bunch of SEC shills in it talking as if crypto is the enemy and the SEC is going to make it all better. The SEC isn't going to stop here and they have 0 intentions of providing clarity for the industry. They are pushing innovation, billions of tax dollars and companies out of the country. Listen to Gary Gensler, he said, \"There is one digital currency and we already have it, it's called the dollar.\" He said this not even 3 days ago on live TV. This doesn't end at coinbase and binance. The goal is clearly to eventually remove crypto entirely and implement the FedNow next month, \"US CBDC\" So the feds have complete control.\n\n\nif they succeed with their full mission, altcoins, including dogecoin, are going to 0. I hope you know that.",

That is not how crypto will survive. We can\u2019t keep having an FTX collapse every couple years. \n\nRegulation has to happen and the SEC is the only organization that can do that. Having disputes go through the courts is just how we do things in the US. No company is just going to say \u201cok SEC thanks for the rules\u201d no questions asked. There will always be a process that iterates on the proposed rules through law suits and courts.",

If the SEC is working for us and working towards a legitimate industry, why don't we have clear regulation? why are crypto companies trying to comply to the best of their abilities getting ignored and instead, we have lawsuits potentially putting US retail investors at extreme risk? \n\n\nI want regulation just like everybody else does, CLEAR regulation would remove everything everyone is worrying about. We don't have it. The SEC is dodging addressing it, and are hitting everyone they can with lawsuits. How is this beneficial to retail investors or the industry as a whole in anyway shape or form? Regulation would force companies with illegal business practices to shut down or move out of the country. That's what we want. You can't penalize someone who is asking time and time again for a clear ruleset because the current rules are extremely unclear, confusing and leaves so many loopholes to expose law abiding companies like coinbase to be hit with lawsuits whenever the SEC chooses like we are seeing now.\n\n\nCoinbase has been public about addressing all of this for quite a while now, and I strongly recommend listening to the videos.

How will that protect US investors? by locking up their assets for potentially years? Is that a legitimate uncorrupt move against a company that has been trying to abide by the unclear rules and asking for clarity? \n\n\nThey don't need clarity on why they are being sued. Crypto companies need clarity on regulation so they don't get sued. Coinbase has asked for this time and time again and have been ignored. The SEC is not working in crypto or retail investors' best interest. That should be obvious by now. \n\n\nThis alone is enough to prove corruption. \n\nLawsuits are NOT the only way to move forward. That is false. Clear regulation is the only way to move forward and the SEC has 0 interest in pursuing that. Politicians have even presented regulation and have demanded clear regulation, we have yet to see anything.\n\n\nAltcoin daily on youtube, is a great source for daily news thats been covering both sides of the issue, I definitely recommend that if you haven't been watching already.",

They are blatantly attacking Americans making money off of crypto currency. It goes against the global narrative of \"Keep the poor, poor.\"\n\nJokes on them, I'm one of you. They can't supress us much longer, and nothing they can do will stop what is coming.\n\nLiquid_at also has a valid point.\nA lot of the exchanges are absolutely corrupt and rob their users through crypto. A good example is Robinhood shows you the price of the crypto, but upon buying, charges you an undisclosed fee that doesn't really seem to be relative to anything in prospect to the individual value of each coin.\n\nIf doges price is 0.0618. Robinhood will force you to buy the coin at around 0.0630/each. And if you limit your order to buy at the current price, robinhood won't fill your order until the fee has equated to the proper current value of the coin. So if you wanna buy at its current price (let's say 0.0618) and put a limit order FOR the current price, it won't sell you the coin until around the 0.0598 area.\n\nRobin and Crypto.com are scared right now. Which is why they have delisted certain coins associated with the S.E.C lawsuits to avoid becoming the next target. The most foolish thing is that they think this will save them from their corruption. \ud83d\ude02",

That clown Gensler went on the news and very arrogantly stated that the US already has digital currency. \u201cIt\u2019s called the US Dollar.\u201d  \n\nJust think about this statement for moment. This is not a fact. This was said as if anyone who didn\u2019t know this already, or questioned this idea was missing something obvious. \n\nHe didn\u2019t state any facts about what cryptocurrency is, the purpose behind it, or the benefits of blockchain technology.  \n\nThis is the same person that couldn\u2019t answer the question, \u201cWhat is a security?\u201d Last month. \n\nIf this was a matter of illegal activity, he wouldn\u2019t be on the news stating opinions, he would have very plainly said, \u201cThis is what a security is, and these are the laws that Coinbase and Binance are violating.\u201d  \n\nOn the conspiracy theory side, It\u2019s most likely about the US Dollar being in real jeopardy for the first time in history. \n\nNot just because of inflation, not because of BRICS moving away from using USD.  \n\nBecause the king of blockchain/crypto (BTC) is a monetary system of rules without rulers. \n\nWhat would the Federal Government do if they had to be financially and fiscally responsible, just like the rest of us do?  \n\nAre you allowed to print money?  \n\nAre you allowed to hand out money for whatever purpose you please and pass the bill onto strangers and their future generations? \n\nBlockchain technology and cryptocurrency is a real threat to a dying archaic system. \n\nIf Bitcoin became the world currency, this would force all world governments to be financially responsible. \n\nEverything about who gets elected, and why, would he based on politicians doing what actually is in the best interest of the country. (Not just remaining in power)\n\nHow many career politicians would last if they couldn\u2019t adjust to this? \n\nThat\u2019s a long way of saying that Gensler needs to be relieved of position. \ud83d\ude02",

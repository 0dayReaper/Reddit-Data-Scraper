The 4900 bad trades are offset by 4900 profitable trades, leaving you with 200 trades as profit.\n\nBut drawing lines on a graph is not \"TA\", the lines are a result of the TA you did.\n\nThey are a visualization of the result of your work, not the work itself.\n\nMost youtube traders use the most simple methods and then pretend that it is what definitively will happen in the future. That's not what TA is. \n\nClaiming that TA is fake, because most people don't know how to do it is like claiming that Michelangelo wasn't a good painter, because most people can't paint or that Jimmy Hendrix couldn't play the guitar, because most people can't play it... \n\nIt requires skill to do TA and just drawing lines on a graph does not cut it.",

There's no rhyme or reason. Btc/eth I have benefit from using technicals quite a bit. Dogecoin has no limit to how much can be produced so the entire market is driven by hype. Btc for example is finite and also has a halving period every 4 years that spikes the entire crypto market as a whole. There is a cycle. Halving period, btc boom, people take profits and put into altcoins, btc corrects, altcoins spike, people take profits and put back into btc etc etc.",

The effects of TA can be mathematically proven and any opinion about whether it is real or not is pointless, if it contradicts the math.\n\nIt just isn't the magic crystal ball that some youtubers pretend it is. It's just statistical probability based on historic experience. It's better than random guessing. That's all there is to it. \n\nTrying to do TA once, failing and declaring it BS just means you did not put in the work to understand it. 40% of predictions failing does not mean that the 60% it works are pure luck. It means you have a method that allows you to profit on 20% of the trades, while the remaining trades are balanced between profit and loss. \n\nIf your trading-portfolio has 100k in it and you manage to profit 10% on 20% of that every month, you earn 2k every month. That's what TA is for. \n\nMake thousands of trades and on average, you profit every month, even if 40% of your trades don't work out, 60% will work out, leaving you in profit.\n\nEVERY single TA method has a risk of not working out. There is no definitive prediction. It's just about odds in an ever-evolving financial system.",

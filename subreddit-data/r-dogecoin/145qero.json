Lol wouldn't they have already sold after the all time high a few years back? If they bought back in, in a significant way; wouldn't the price be much higher? \n\nTanking doge would only scare people from doge, not crypto as a whole. They would have to tank bitcoin in order to destroy crypto, and that's impossible. There's too much diversity and market cap to make a significant dent in the value of the coin as a whole. \n\nYou are simply lying to people, in an incredibly lazy and obvious way, in order to manipulate them into buying more of your favorite coin. \n\nI like doge, and have bought several times over the years, but I can't stand people like you.",

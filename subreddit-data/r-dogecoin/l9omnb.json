The question is, is it a good idea to send my dogecoin from changelly to dogechain wallet, and if so, how do I go about it?\n\nPlease bear in mind that I really know fuckin' squat about all this.

And can you access it via the client somehow?\n\nReading this guide indicates that you probably already have a wallet and thus don't need to do anything https://changelly.com/blog/how-to-buy-doge/",

From my understanding, yes, changelly does provide the user with a wallet, which is why I ask: is it a good idea to transfer it from changelly to another wallet? Like, would it be safer, or easier to use having it elsewhere? or does changelly (or other sites, for that matter) let you store your crypto for a limited time, then they start charging you? This is so new to me that I'm not even sure if I'm asking the correct questions. Thank you for your replies, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: These are the guides I followed:[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7np1m/how\\_to\\_buy\\_dogecoin\\_in\\_5\\_easy\\_steps\\_in\\_5\\_easy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7np1m/how_to_buy_dogecoin_in_5_easy_steps_in_5_easy/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7k90j/buying\\_dogecoin\\_in\\_mexico/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l7k90j/buying_dogecoin_in_mexico/)\n\nThe first one apaprently only works in Canada, so I had to use partly the second one (since I'm in M\u00e9xico, Changelly doesn't allow me to buy from mexican peso to dogecoin for whatever reason). The second one suggest using Binance instead of Changelly, but I had already made an account there, so I decided to try it out.",

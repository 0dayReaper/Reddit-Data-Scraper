I would say if you look at other crypto currency and their past and then look at Doge\u2019s current popularity and positioning and compare their past to the others there is a lot of parity. To me it looks like a very good investment if you are willing to endure volatility and can hold strong. There\u2019s soo much money pouring in and circulating right now it\u2019s isn\u2019t just going to up and fail. You might not be tied to a rocket ship atm but you are most definitely in the wheelhouse. Have faith in your investment and your community.",

Don\u2019t give your money to a stranger, see losses and then panic sell, thus guaranteeing your losses. That\u2019s what the OLD market was made of\u2014 suckering newbies from their cash. This is a community of good people not trying to live off of the misery of those.

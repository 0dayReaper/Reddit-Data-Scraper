I send the some more...\n\nThey then proceed to not have any communication with me for 8 months after that. Figured all was well... Then I received a letter saying that my return will soon be sent. (Wait what)... 2 weeks later I get a check with my return + some more. (Huh)\n\n1 week later I get a letter saying I now OWE them taxes for 2019 PLUS interest. I spend a week trying get ahold of someone. I finally do get with an IRS agent on the phone, I \"fix\" the issue going step by step. They admit it was 1 person that made a mistake and now I'm the one paying for their mistake, literally. I am furious. \n\nI then get threatening letters for the next 3 weeks saying I must pay, if I don't, they will freeze my accounts while the balance is coming in with increasing interest. However I log in to my account and my balance is $0.00. They stop coming in after 1 month. \n\nIt's been 5 weeks since my return, I still don't have my money. My wife and I never got any of the last 2 stimulus checks and my records for last year weren't clear enough for an e-file. So I am hoping the mailed file is up to their standards. Otherwise, it's a wait till December.",

I think that the name of the coin alone is enough for it to stick around in the news and eventually after a few years maybe it could hit a dollar. My gut is telling me that we are at a loval peak in the graph, and we are going to see it drop over the next few months, but eventually as the name gets out there more it will raise consistently. Also, I think once coinbase adds doge to their list of purchasable coin we'll see a spike.",

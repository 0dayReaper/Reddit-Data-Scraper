They receive far more income but in order to maintain their \"no kill\" status they largely reject bully breeds and dogs that might take longer to adopt despite having open room. These dogs inevitably end up either on the street or being euthanized in a normal shelter that does not have room for more dogs. No kill shelters are a farce and do more harm than good.",

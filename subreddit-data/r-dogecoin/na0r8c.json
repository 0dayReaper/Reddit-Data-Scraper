Bitcoin being north of 55K was unthinking just a few years ago.  Does DOGE have the kind of legs to run well beyond $1?  Is the focus on $1 just a first major milestone?  Can you point to sources that discuss this?\n\nThank you for interacting!",

If I took the average of what reports say ( Forbes, motley fool, FXS ) it could be anywhere from .62 to .95.(hoping for 1.00 of course!) This is being conservative, as we see it has already recoiled to about .50 since SNL. ( .43 was it's lowest during the SNL period )\n\nMaybe not as bullish as before, Dogecoin price predictions have faltered, but they are all still pointing to big growth in 2021.\n\nDigitalCoinPrice\u00a0retracted their prediction quite a bit over the weekend. Still, they say DOGE will gain, finishing off the year at 78 cents.\n\nThe Economy Forecast Agency\u00a0is still putting their bet on gains for Dogecoin this year. The outlet has pegged DOGE for a $2.38 price in December, one of the most bullish predictions of the week.\n\nFXStreet\u00a0is still optimistic on Dogecoin, but says the coin faces a big moment. If it can pass the 61-cent resistance level it now faces on the rebound, it can break out and shoot toward $1.\n\nsources:\n\nhttps://www.crypto-rating.com/price-prediction/doge/\n\nhttps://www.cryptonewsz.com/forecast/dogecoin-price-prediction/amp/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fxstreet.com/amp/cryptocurrencies/news/dogecoin-price-forecast-doge-eyes-consolidation-after-its-recent-pullback-202105100316\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/dogecoin-price-live-bitcoin-crypto-ethereum-b1845489.html%3famp\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/05/dogecoin-price-predictions-where-will-crypto-astronauts-take-doge-ahead-of-spacex-launch/amp/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/capital.com/amp/dogecoin-price-prediction-all-the-way-up-to-1-usd\n\nTO THE MOON!",

It wouldn't require total economic collapse, but it would require millions of new people buying doge, and everyone of them holding. Still not gonna happen, but for different reasons.",

YOU DO NOT own any Cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood and send it to your own wallet for example, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency.\n\nRobinhood has shown in the past that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.\n\nIf you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. You can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes you through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step. And answers most of the questions one might have in the beginning. The process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood.\n\nYou can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there.\n\nMore in-depth explanation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6i468/ditch_robinhood/",

So the price isn't affected either. Robinhood basically just bought a ton of coins and you buy a portion of their coins? Is that correct or do they just do bulk orders occasionally to match users' transactions? Either way the doge you buy in robinhood isn't your doge. They don't send you the coins.",

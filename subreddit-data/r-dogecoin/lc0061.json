As designed it doesn't have a hard cap like bitcoin, but the hard cap actually makes people hoard bitcoin out of FOMO and is afraid to spend it. With doge we can freely experiment and spend, such as for online instant small transactions.",

Its really dangerous as far a liquidity goes, and could fuck alot of people in the end. Be careful friends!",

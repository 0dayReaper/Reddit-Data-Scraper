But how much of that fear is the product of the situation created and how much is the product of not trusting the stuck because you believe it sucks. Typically in my experience, if you feel the arguments for the stock or crypto are compelling, not paying excessive attention to the situation created brings results. Don\u2019t sweat it. If you see it\u2019s going below your average, just sell and buy again whenever it begins to show signs of going back up. That\u2019s to me the worst case scenario, but then it\u2019s also the best scenario because you can come back in with a lower average. MHO. Good luck and strength!",

If we compare to the gold standard of crypto, Bitcoin, the chances of Doge surpassing $5 is slim unless some changes are made.\n\nThere are about 18 million Bitcoin in circulation, giving Bitcoin a total value of about $630 billion. So if Doge got to $5 somehow, it would have about the same total value as Bitcoin. \n\nIt seems that for Doge to go beyond $5, a lot of Doge would need to be taken out of circulation. For those that know more about cryptocurrency than I do, is that even possible? I\u2019m interested to hear the thoughts of others on this.",

They can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes them through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step. The process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide.\n\nYou do not own any cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood. Back in January, Robinhood was accused of restricting users\u2019 trading activities. This was in the middle of the Gamestop saga. Users of Robinhood found themselves unable to buy any Gamestop stock from Robinhood and the matter has made it to US Congress by now. Now In the middle of the current run Dogecoin is having, a number of users across social media have reported being unable to buy or sell their Dogecoin on Robinhood.\n\nThis is eerily similar to the incident where users weren\u2019t able to buy Gamestop stock. You cannot transfer or withdraw your Dogecoin either, as you\u2019re not actually buying a crytocurrency on Robinhood, but an \u201dIOU\u201d.",

There are too many what like to call smash &amp; grab investors ( quick cash people ) it's absolutely fine to take profits at any point in your investment but the longer you hold the stronger the value is of your investment. I buy no means am criticizing anyone but I fancy myself a diamond hands investor! I don't think Doge will hit a dollar today ( it will at some point ) I'm not sure we\u2019ll touch 50 cents today! i.will be happy to be wrong on this, just food for thought.",

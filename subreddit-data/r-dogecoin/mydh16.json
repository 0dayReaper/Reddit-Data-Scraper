Valuations in the context of companies are used to give you a rough estimate of what a company is worth in dollars so you can compare it to the worth of another company in dollars.  When you are looking at the market cap of Dogecoin that is like saying Tesla is worth 40 GEs.\n\nI could tell you that the USD has a market cap of 20 trillion Dogecoins.  That is more than the entire supply of Doge in existence.   We could also wake up tomorrow morning and Jeff Bezos could say Amazon is accepting Doge at $40 a coin and Doge would be worth $40 and Jeff Bezos wouldn\u2019t lose a dime.\n\nStop throwing around big numbers if you don\u2019t have any idea how this works.",

I actually saw Bitcoin going somewhere when it was about a buck and was talked out of investing my \u201chard earned money on a trendy tech toy\u201d by every single person I knew with any sort of experience in money management. And now that 10k I wanted to invest but went into lowering my payment on my used Pontiac Grand Prix that I don\u2019t have anymore... well it would be worth about 500 million bucks lol. My point is, regardless of what anyone can \u201csee happening\u201d in the end it\u2019s your money, if YOU feel like you\u2019ve got a good investment then do what you feel is best. Sooooo many others like me who woulda coulda shoulda done whatever whenever, it\u2019s painful looking at what we never saw coming because we know in hindsight we should probably have gotten in on it. So many more opportunities every single day, even if it\u2019s a penny crypto, which I\u2019m pretty convinced are the quickest way to make some coin... pun intended. Lol have a good day and good luck with your investment and most of all have fun doing so!!!",

I\u2019ve absolutely thought about the fact that I\u2019d probably be looking at far less than half by now, like that poor bastard who bought a couple pizzas for like 12 Bitcoin \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 or that one guy who bought in early and didn\u2019t even care to remember or write down his password and now can\u2019t access his hundreds of millions of USD worth of BTC. But honestly I\u2019d at least have far more than I do now, I know when something is gaining attraction and value, the reason I had such a hard time accepting advice at the time and really I was right... just didn\u2019t listen to my gut, like I\u2019ve gone through some very rough mental states just over this one thing I chose not to do. Kicked myself in the nuts everyday since. But you\u2019re 100% correct and I definitely would have sold off some here and there for sure, however, I\u2019d definitely have kept some to see where it went. If I just kept one it would be an extra 45 grand in the bank right now lol. I guess the point of my response was just to point out that we all see things in the rear view mirror and it really sucks at times but everyday there are some very lucrative opportunities just waiting for us to follow our gut, do a little research and either make money or take as a learning experience.",

The fact that we\u2019ve all become a \u201cserious\u201d coin suddenly, and are having a good laugh at Wall Street, is just...it\u2019s just the best, really. The community &amp; good cheer of Doge is now poised to become something genuinely beautiful:\n\nA change to take control of wealth away from the self-appointed maters of the universe, and give it back to The People. In the end, Doge is worth what we say it is, and so long as it continues to be backed by mutual respect, support, and our collective confidence in goodness, and a good cause...our Doge will always be worth more than all the hoarded dollars in all the cold, cynical, self-serving banks in all the world.

Read !!!!!!!!! \n\nIF YOU HAVE MONEY IN DOGE THEN READ THIS!!!\n\nThe only reason that it\u2019s staggering is because free trading brokerages like Robinhood are making you wait until your deposits go through, which takes up to 5 days, so ALLL of these people who WANT to put in CANT because their deposits have not gone through. SO DO NOT SELL. HOLD HOLD HOLD. Once these boys\u2019 deposits come through we\u2019ll be by mid week next week!!!\n\nI COPIED THIS FROM A THREAD THAT WAS REMOVED BY THE MODERATORS. HOLD BOYS LETS LIGHT THE ROCKET.",

What this means is that you can only purchase them using funds that have been completely transfered from your bank to RH, which usually takes a couple of days. It's a dirty trick to artificially slow the growth of these cryptos that are surging out of control right now. The slower growth (and percieved loss of value) makes lots of other investors nervous, so they end up selling before they lose their profit. If we all keep buying and holding though, the price doesn't drop.",

Sorry. \n\nIf you buy on an exchange like kraken, binance, bittrex etc., you have a wallet that stores the coins (similar to btc). On Robinhood they still purchase the coins for you but you don't have access to the wallet adress.\n\nFrom RH's website:\n\n&gt; We don\u2019t currently provide you with access to your wallet or your wallet address.\n\n&gt; You own the cryptocurrency assets in your account, and you can buy or sell them at any time. We\u2019re evaluating features to allow you to safely transfer coins to and from Robinhood, and we\u2019ll update you when these features are available.",

Edit: And I honestly believe Dogecoin can beat bitcoin, meme power is stronger then people think. Getting dogecoin taken seriously is part of what makes this worthwhile!

The apps are crashing because hundreds of thousands of people are trying to buy. Robinhood isn\u2019t allowing instant transfers because they can\u2019t afford to loan everybody money while the bank processes your deposit. This common practice. It\u2019s always been like this for years. Anybody who tells you different is dumb money and has no idea what they\u2019re saying. You can buy doge once your money clears. THE PRICE IS GOING TO SKY ROCKET. SCREW THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83e\ude90\n\nWe are the pioneers. WE (400,000 who are in this thread) DECIDE THE PRICE.\n\nWe have a chance for generational wealth. Don\u2019t be stupid.\n\nTHIS IS FOR THE HOLDERS: I have a plan. Hear me out. If you agree; upvote\n\nLet\u2019s all collectively agree to set the floor at .05. The majority of people here should have purchased their dogecoin below this price.\n\nThis means that if we buy anytime it starts to dip under .05 it will raise back to at least that threshold. it doesn\u2019t have to be much 5 dollars by 400,000 people is monumental.\n\nNext step. When it reaches $1 sell EXACTLY 10% of your coin. NOT all. This way we can get some net profit no matter what happens. So if In the off chance it does completely crash you already made profit. Since the 10% will cover your initial investment and some change.\n\nAfter that the remaining 90% just HOLD YOUR ROCKET \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 TO THE STARS\n\nCOPY AND PASTE THIS POST FOR THE OGs TO SEE",

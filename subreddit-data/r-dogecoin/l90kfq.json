This means there is a lag in purchasing that will last anywhere from 3 to 5 business days. I\u2019m betting by Thursday we\u2019ll see another upswing. My only concern is that people won\u2019t be able to instantly invest when they see the upswing. This will likely break any impulsive fomo-based, natural growth explosion. I get that Robinhood may be terrified of being caught holding the bag if there\u2019s a HUGE influx of doge bets when some percentage of them can\u2019t be covered, but this is the wrong solution. They need to find more capital and better insurance rather than put the burden on their customers and STIFLE a historic rally! This should be criminal. But they consider us (doge investors, along with GameStop and AMC, etc) unsophisticated and undeserving of real problem solving.   \nBut if they decide to reverse their position on instant transfers for doge, and/or if doge names an upward limit on coins, we\u2019re blasting the fuck off!",

If they reverse course on this, doge is going crazy high!\n\nThe real issue may be that of perceived legitimacy. When Bitcoin surges, there\u2019s theory to support its legitimacy. Doge is a joke coin named for a meme. I\u2019m not dogging on it. That\u2019s just what it is. Gold is fake money too. But I wonder if Robinhood just doesn\u2019t want the press associated with surging a joke coin to the stratosphere? Regardless, they need to realize real fucking investors also buy doge! They\u2019re currently alienating their customers. So there\u2019s no substance tied to its value- The stock price of Tesla has nothing to do with reality either! Nor does the price of gold. They need to let the market do its thing. They\u2019re just afraid of this brave new populist investor class!",

Serious \n\nIn order for this to work we need everyone to hold. We need to stay strong and not panic. We are just feeding money to all the s.ho.rt.s(PU.MP AND DU.MP)!! We need it to keep going up so they can not sell to rebuy at lower price!! KEEP IT GOING UP EVERYONE!!\n\nSome People have developed software that calculates pattern (such as bots). These bots tell the user when to buy and sell for profit. The more we sell and run away like cowards, the more money we will be giving to them. If we push pass their markers they will have to buy again because it will not drop back to their buy in marker after the sell off marker.\n\nPEOPLE WHO ARE BOTTING DO NOT WANT THIS to SPREAD... UPVOTE!! Our goal is to hit 1 DOLLAR....we can do it no problem. we just need unity and patience. This will not happen overnight. Maybe in a week, month , or even a year. It is truly possible if we stick together.\n\nWe have seen their recent actions. They have blocked us from buying doge. They have blocked us from buying GameStop or even AMC. They are scared of this new community. With DOGE we can flip the tide.DO NOT LET THE (1%) RICH KEEP LAUGHING AT US! WE ARE the (99%)! Disclaimer: Not all 1% are bad but some are for the people. We will see it in this movement.\n\nTHINK ABOUT HOW SCARED THEY ARE ..THEY ARE BLOCKING INSTANT TRANSFERS FOR A REASON! LETS MAKE DOGE explode. THEN WITH THE PROFITS (Taxes that will be charged by the government) LET THEM PAY SCHOOL LOANS. WE CAN MAKE A HUGE CHANGE IN THE WORLD! About 43 million people in America have student loans. If you invest , it will not only help you but millions of other people. It is time for a change. PLEASE SHARE AND UPVOTE!....DOGE IS FOR THE PEOPLE!!!!",

            "comment": "Thank you for spreading awareness, people!\n\nThere are a lot of so called financial experts on reddit and youtube spreading bullshit about the supply cap of Dogecoin and calling it a worthless memecoin.\n\nYes, Dogecoin has a supply growth of about 5 billion coins (that's about 4-5% right now) per year, but why is that a problem? The growth is there to keep transaction fees to a minimum.\n\nDogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter.\n\nIf Bitcoin wants to become a real global currency with buying power, not just a speculation tool to exchange it for a few thousand debt based USD when it hits a new record high every few months or years, it's supply will have to grow inevitably.\n\nWe have to see the bigger picture! Dogecoin will climb to a dollar, but why sell there? We could build a new, fair, balanced monetary system with Dogecoin, not to make a quick profit, but to change the whole world.\n\nOur money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. \n\n\"You're stupid if you buy Dogecoin, it has no value, it has unlimited supply.\" Yeah right, but your fucking US dollar, which is created out of thin air, is backed by debt and is inflating to endlessness, has value? It has a limited supply?  Please, think about that for a few minutes!\n\nDogecoin has not an unlimited supply in the sense that the supply could grow 10x from one moment to another, devaluing your Dogecoins by a 1000% in an instant, which could happen to any \"normal\" currency and is happening right now to the USD. That's just not possible, because of the way mining Dogecoin works. It has a fixed number of new units every year, so if the value of 1 unit goes up, the percentage of inflation goes down. People need to understand this. \n\nDogecoin has the possibility to change our perception on money and what money stands for. It can't be backed by signatures on a debt contract, it has to be backed by real goods and services.\n\nIt shouldn't be a tool to make a quick buck of when you see the green candle skyrocketing. Dogecoin needs to be more than that. Yes, sell some of it when it hits a dollar, but stay in it for the long run.\n\nUnderstand and spread awareness of the fact that our current money is valueless, but we all agree with the illusion that it \"works\", so it's still \"valuable\" in the sense that we use it everyday to buy goods and services.\n\nWe could apply that same illusion to Dogecoin, but here it would be different, because it's not backed by debt, like the USD is. It would be backed by real values and our trust in it. \n\nPlease share the truth and let people know!",

    "postText": "The gates are about to open.\nThe fastest runners have already taken their head start and are separated from the majority of the pack.\nThe slowest ones in the back will have the option to jump the fence and get out, or die trying to accomplish something they never were capable of.\n\nThe recent happenings have forced the invitation and initiation of what is to follow. Did anyone ever stop and think or realize that the lower it got, the stronger the inevitable rise? Everytime the price dips it immediately returned close to where it was while still inching away from the Golden cross. If you couldn't see the suppression of the Golden cross on the charts, you had no idea when it was going to be. The price has been supressed so strongly that it has finally gathered the momentum to continue pushing upwards. Litecoin hasn't even halved yet, and bitcoin is still coming.\n\nThis is the Kali-Yuga.\nRide the wave.\nEnjoy yourself.\nForget what others say.\nBelieve in what your heart tells you.\nNever doubt change.\nMost importantly, Do Only Good Everyday.\n\nLet it be said: The first notion of the initiation of what is to come was posted here in this subreddit because it's the only place in the web where the people were truly deserving to know it was about to happen. \n\nMany blessings and universal guidance to all those whom are deserving of its gifts. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed.\n\nHere we go, I hope the best place on reddit has their running shoes on and stretched before the race. You're going to need it.\n\nDon't let the dip of the dying break your stride. It's natural. People always die in the running of the bulls. It's the price everyone in the race told themselves they are willing to pay long before ever signing up.\nI've been here, giving out Nikes to those who need them. They have little wings on the back of them because Hermes told me redbull actually does give you wings. So to those of you whom have them, congratulations. Let them carry you to the finish line.\n\nComical analogy? Or distortion of reality?\nI'll let you decide what to do as you have always decided for yourselves anyways.\n\nLet the running of the bulls commence.\n\n*The gun fires as the gates slam open.*",

So when u fools buy into jsut hopin for it to surge and then pull out, you're defeating the purpose of it. Hold it, and use the currency as it becomes available on more and more platforms as a means of payment. Or transfer it to BTC but keep it in crypto",

If my balance on my bank account is $14.71 cents at the end of the day, then I drop 71 cents into DOGE. I only cash out as needed, and I do my best to make sure it's not all at once. Been out of a job for 3.5 months due to pandemic problems, but I am employed again. As such, I hope to be dropping more money into DOGE and other crypto in about 2 weeks.",

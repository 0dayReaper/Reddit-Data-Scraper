But it's still phenomenal for growth.\n\nWe saw NewEgg announce that they'll start accepting Doge as payment.\n\nWe've still yet to see what SlimJim has been making all their hype about.\n\nAnd that's just _today_.  We've yet to see Dogecoin get onto Coinbase, and yet to see it accepted at a bunch of other popular online retailers.\n\nWe're going awesome!",

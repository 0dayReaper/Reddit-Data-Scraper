    "postText": "Hi folks! I can't believe this place is over a million members now - back when I was active we had less than 10% of this! So I'd like to introduce myself to many new folks - I am Billy Markus, the original creator of Dogecoin. As you may have heard, it was indeed created for sillies after Jackson Palmer made an flippant tweet about it that idea being the 'next big thing' and I threw it together, without any expectation or plan. It took about 3 hours to make, with the bulk of that time making alterations to the client to make the text Comic Sans and some custom graphics and wording for different pieces of the UI.\n\nAs I mentioned on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1355694247526035458), I'm no longer part of the Dogecoin project, I left around 2015 as the community started to strongly shift from one that I was comfortable with. I don't currently own any Dogecoin except what has been tipped to me recently, I gave away and/or sold all the crypto I had back in 2015 after being laid off and scared about my dwindling savings at the time, for about enough in total to buy a used Honda Civic. I'm not struggling - I work full time as a Software Engineer - but I'm mentioning this to set the record straight, as there are many incorrect assumptions around about my involvement and stake in the project.\n\nSo if I'm not involved in Dogecoin, why did I want to post? I wanted to give a little perspective and history for some of the founding principles of Dogecoin, for anyone who was willing to listen.\n\n**Dogecoin message**\n\nWith the recent Dogecoin mania going on, my inbox was being flooded by people demanding me to do things for them so they would become richer. This was a bit jarring for the reasons I mentioned above - and while I am sympathetic to those struggling and understand how emotional and important money can be, especially right now with this pandemic, I couldn't help feeling pretty down about it. My mom is currently struggling to make her home payments and will likely lose her house, and if I hadn't \"messed up\" my crypto investments years ago, I would be able to comfortably help her.\n\nBut I did receive some encouraging words and a few small tips - and honestly, that did help take the sting off everything and elevate my mood. And more relevantly, it reminded me of one of the original messages of Dogecoin - one of unexpected generosity. I'll explain that message with a story.\n\n**\"Save Dogemas\"**\n\nThe first few weeks after Dogecoin was released was incredibly fast moving, and I think I would succinctly describe it as \"complete utter insanity.\" It went from a silly joke to something worth something to people very quickly, and a community was developing fast, with lots of shady people and lots of new people, quickly putting up services and infrastructure around it.\n\nOne of those things was an online wallet - instead of having to download the clunky and slow main client where you have to download the whole blockchain, someone had provided a service to hold people's Dogecoin for them. Online wallets in the history of cryptocurrency have a history of being sketchy, however, and sure enough, on Christmas, the wallet was hacked, and 21 million Dogecoins were stolen in the process.\n\nThis type of story was all too common in cryptocurrency world, but what happened next was not. Some members of the community got together and started a Dogecoin fund to \"Save Dogemas\" - to try to return money to those who had lost it, and the community - to my great surprise - was willing to help. The Dogecoin community donated millions of coins to help those who had been victims of the bad actor - and that spirit didn't stop, the community would donate Dogecoins for both good causes, such as helping build [water wells in Africa](https://www.coindesk.com/dogecoin-foundation-raise-50k-kenya-water-crisis), [helping connect service dogs and kids](https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5377984/dogecoin-community-raises-money-to-send-service-dogs-to-kids), and silly and amusing causes, such as helping [send the Jamaican Bobsled team to the Olympics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/20/jamaican-bobsled-team-raises-dogecoin-winter-olympics), or [sponsoring a Nascar driver](https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/tech/web/nascar-dogecoin-talladega/index.html).\n\n**True Value**\n\nPeople are talking about Dogecoin going to $1 - that would make the \"market cap\" larger than actual companies that provide services to millions, such as Boeing, Starbucks, American Express, IBM. Does Dogecoin deserve that? That is not something I can comprehend, let alone answer.\n\nAgain, I have no real say in this, and everyone has the right to value the coin in any way they wish - it is just my wish, as the original creator, **that Dogecoin and the Dogecoin community can be a force for good**. And I don't mean that in some sanctimonious way where the only thing of value is giving to charity or directly helping others - anything that is amusing or fun has value as well. The fiat value of Dogecoin is quite literally whatever someone else is willing to pay for it at any point in time, and the intrinsic value is not something I will ever be able to define, so when I talk about value, I'm not talking about those things. I'm talking about \"True Value\", which I'd define as the positive things Dogecoin brings to the world.\n\nPump and dumping, rampant greed, scamming, bad faith actors, demanding from others, hype without research, taking advantage of others - those are all worthless. Worse than worthless, honestly, bringing more negativity to an already difficult world. As the creator, some have called me the \"doge mother\" so I say this with that mask - when I see things like that - and I've seen plenty of it through the last 7 years - I'm not mad, just disappointed.\n\nJoy, kindness, learning, giving, empathy, fun, community, inspiration, creativity, generosity, silliness, absurdity. These types of things are what makes Dogecoin worthwhile to me. **If the community embodies these things, that's True Value.**\n\nIf you read this far, I appreciate it. Keep educating yourself as much as you can on how cryptocurrency works, how these markets work, never risk more than you could safely lose, be vigilant and aware. I wish you all the best.",

Especially when you consider the silly things we did: Jamaican Bobseld team, sponsoring nascar racer, etc. I\u2019ve absolutely loved it. \n\nI was planning on making my own post later today in hopes of trying to get this subreddit back on track. We need more of the good, and far less of the bad.\n\nWe as a community need to stop upvoting the obvious karma farming and low effort posts. I\u2019m talking about you \u201cWHOS HOLDING TIL X\u201d, \u201chands up if you\u2019re not selling until Y\u201d, etc. it\u2019s awful, it\u2019s tacky, and it does nothing but make r/Dogecoin look like a pump and dump coin. which it is not. \n\nCould doge hit $0.5, $1, even $10?? Who knows. \n\nAll i know is i want the community to come back to its roots. This isnt a get rich quick scheme. This is an amazing community that does incredible things for others. Lets bring it back.\n\n*Quick edit as this is gaining traction*\n\nBelow I would love it if everyone commented ways we could bring the community back to its roots, and even expand on them. Especially considering the newfound wealth we\u2019ve gained with such an insane rise! With a better community, we\u2019ll have a higher chance of Dogecoin adoption and more meaningful growth for the coin itself. I know it\u2019s not original, but my favorite things we\u2019ve done are helping the underdoges. \n\nHow do **you** think we can help the underdoge?",

I said to them, don't spend your money on something just because internet strangers are telling you to - definitely not your life savings. Buy $20 if you can afford it, and remember, no one *knows* where the value of doge will go - you could certainly lose all of that money. I was astonished when I saw people urging them on, just like with GME. Truly upsetting. But I just spread my little bit of wisdom and that is all I can do.",

This is embarrassing but I really had no idea that this was even a crypto sub when I subscribed. I stumbled onto the sub and thought the memes were funny and everyone seemed so good natured I wanted to stick around. \n\nI quickly realized I basically had no idea what this really was and as soon as I understood what Doge Coin actually was I liked everyone around here even more. I remember the old memes, the tips flying left and right, the condoms, the bobsled, the car, all of the other stuff I'm missing and just general goodwill. I would love to see another something to rally behind like the bobsled, I think doing stuff like that really brings out the best in this sub. I just wanted to say all that, I know probably the last person you want to listen to is someone who didn't even realize what this was at first but I just thought I'd throw it out there. I stuck around even when I was clueless because this was such a funny, niche, happy, silly group on reddit. Thanks, guys!",

That is why I regard Doge as The People\u2019s Coin. We don\u2019t *have* to play the dollar game.\n\nUtility not withstanding, value is derived from social behavior. We, collectively, decide what is and isn\u2019t valuable. If we choose to value, trade, and invest Doge instead of dollars, there is quite literally nothing on Earth that can stop us from doing it. And all of a sudden, the wealth is in the hands of the people who trust each other and deal in Doge, while the glass tower ghouls on The Street are left holding bags of worthless dollars. Bags of greed, built on an artificial  scarcity. Those ghouls wail and gibber about inflation, but the reality is, Doge isn\u2019t \u201cinflationary.\u201d\n\nIt just reflects the reality that scarcity is an illusion, and that there is infinitely more material wealth available than we, all 8 billion of us, could possibly consume.

I am one of the people who was drawn to Doge because of the fun nature of it (that cute shiba inu is a total winner) and the just good-natured-fun of it all!. My son bought Doge for both of us and it has been on heck of a fun ride with (at least so far) one of the coolest investment communities I have yet met---which is kind of a low bar since I haven't known ANY investment communities before this! So, at 57 and for the first time in my life I am involved in crypto. SO, now for the meat of this post. I saw, from your Twitter than you live in the city. I am originally from SF. Grew up there but had to leave the old family home of multi generations when it became too expensive. My son is in NY and he has brought me out here to live with him now, but what you mentioned about your mom losing her house struck me. I don't know the mechanics of doing something like this but would it be cool if we set up a Go Fund Me to help her out? I know how expensive the city or surrounding areas are, and I know how much it broke my heart to be forced out of the area. I would be willing to do this and if all our fellow Diamond Shibe could contribute at least 1 dollar we might be able to help with this. Does anyone else on here know how to do this thing? I have no problem setting it up but then would come the promotion part of it...and I wouldn't want to do something like this without your permission. Anyway, it's a thought. I have to head out to the store but will check back in at intervals. Heck, I STILL miss Bartlett Street and I had to leave the city back in the mid 1980s. Being forced out of your home is a sucky place to be.",

Could this be avoided or possibly reduced if an exchange like entity set up a \"DogeWorldTrust\" wallet that never dumps. Ever... So a user would donate to the wallet with the understanding that this wallet is basically a Doge fort knox and it does 2 things. 1. It acts a foundation for Doge to stand on and gains a stable value with less flux. Ie: imagine if the 14 million thats made daily was put in said wallet and never dumped. The price would become more stable right? If you held doge that would make your bag worth more, right? 2. This could be the way major Earth saving projects are funded. A voting system could be setup to determine which project is funded and for how long. The fund would be completely transparent on the chain, you could see the money the whole time. We could see miss deeds and stop paying them immediately. No bs, just fund things that help save the Earth and it residents. With enough participation this might only cost 1 doge a day per user or per transaction. We the people could vote in the \"Ceo\" for lack of a better title (Elon?) to run the wallet and the funds. Maybe setup a loan system that can't turn anyone down and all payments plus interest goes back to the wallet. This could change the world I think. Literally we are the only ones who will help us. So lets do something, lets change this home of ours that is clouded by greed. Give a little get a lot. The only way this works is if we the people put trust behind the belief that we have the power to make change and then do it! You wanna show the naysayers what telling people they are wrong or stupid does to a person, show them what it means to be human and care for all things on Earth, not just ones self. Now I'll end this with I've been drinking and chillin all night and I might just be wrong and stupid. What do you think?",

It was special the day it was created, and it\u2019s been special every day since. Not because of the price. It was just as special when the market cap crashed to $9 million as it was at the loftiest peak of the first pump. It\u2019s as special today as it was when we stayed up all day and all night to vote for Josh Wise, and actually pulled it off.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been saying repeatedly, what\u2019s going on right now is in some ways insane. Much of that insanity came from The manipulators with their bots and shills and spammers and their pump and dump. Some came from hopeful starry eyed noobs dreaming of untold riches. And some, just Shibes being Shibes.\n\nBut it will settle down. The manipulation and the crazy tweets and all the rest of it will fade as people look for the next big thing. Markets will settle, and the get-rich-quick crowd will crawl back into the woodwork.\n\nAnd what will be left behind is the same special thing that was born in a tweet all those years ago, with new throngs of Shibes who \u2018get it\u2019 and who aren\u2019t totally fixated on price.\n\nI look forward to that, as I\u2019m sure you do too. Let\u2019s just hope we have the stamina to get from here to there with our sanity and humour intact.\n\nMuch love, Billy! Welcome back. \u2764\ufe0f",

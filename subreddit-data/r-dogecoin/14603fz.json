It was at over 10 grand and my wife didn't want to sell. Still wish I could've convinced her to let us put more than a couple hundred in back then too.",

            "comment": "I am very experienced and have traded well for years. Even with making all the right moves life can surprise you. \n\nI bought doge at approximately .045 at my cheapest purchase, and again more at .04 then sold around .20 .30 and the rest at .49. I made a nice profit.\n\nI was unexpectedly arrested for a freak accident before the market took massive loss and I have no experience with the law, not even as a minor.\n\nI lost some significant gains and there was nothing I could do about it. My stock market trades were fine because I had puts in place if the market fell 12%, so I'm still up 60% overall. Unfortunately I never found a crypto exchange with features to protect your gains, so the remaining crypto I had is now near my buy in price and at a loss in some others.\n\nI feel your pain but this is the beginning of a great depression which also breeds great opportunity. Research the great depression and learn what happened. Then research some emerging tech like AI, quantum computing, exc.\n\nThere is a lot of opportunity, and gains happening now that blow away anything we have seen in crypto so far. Follow the investment opportunity, not the product. Product loyalty is one of the biggest mistakes we sometimes make. It is important to remain objective and keep loyalty/feelings out of it.\n\nGL guys, I'm honestly doing nothing in crypto these days. I'm invested in Healthcare, and AI. That has turned out to be the best decision I ever made and it's just getting started.",

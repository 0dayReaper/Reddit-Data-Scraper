Btc actually isnt all that useful when you actually start looking at transaction fees. Litecoin has actually the lowest fees and only has a 16billion market cap. But ethereum has the widest network application right now. Meanwhile due to the surge in popularity doge is starting to appear everywhere. Lots of brokers literally just added doge and certain sites and stores are starting to list it as an option to pay with. So they see value in it, thats what gives the cryptos the life they need.

That's more than the total value of every company on every stock exchange on Earth.\n\nThat would mean an entirely digital unit of exchange is worth more than almost the entire physical productive capacity of the planet.\n\nThis is unlikely.",

If doge were to hit a dollar yesterday it would just make doge and it\u2019s community look very suspicious! so my thoughts are that the whales purposely did the complete opposite of what we all expected just to protect us all from the potential bs that could\u2019ve happened if It were to hit a dollar.

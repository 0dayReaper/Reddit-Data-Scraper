You spend money to have fun and, ideally fight to win the prize. The only formula I use is \"how much fun am I having with this money?\" 4 hours of poker? I love it! 4 months of a roller coaster with Doge? Hell yes! It has been well worth what I \"spent\".",

I have never sold at all and am not affected by the fluctuations.\n\nCryptocurrency is more of a means for me to contribute in changing the world rather than changing my life. I don't depend on cryptocurrency \"gains\" to survive or to be rich in the next decade. I recommend you all to actually develop valuable skills and relationships rather than depend on crypto.

You have invested in a highly volatile asset. This is expected. Just as it can moon real fast, it can tank pretty fast too. With that said, I do believe it will rally again. I don't think it's that unrealistic to expect this to reach somewhere between $1 to $2 sometime this year. This is a memecoin, it will rally as long as enough people are interested in it.",

Back when it was worth way less.\n\nPut in $20, played a bunch of gambling stuff etc. Came out with $250~ and was happy.\n\nIt was 100% fun money, I knew I was going to gamble with it anyway and was just interested in how it works and cryptocurrencies and stuff.\n\nI'm back in at 0.0456 after it had the first little blip in this whole ride.\n\nAgain, fun money. Got $800~ right now. About 10x original investment. \n\nIts nice to win but its even better knowing I couldn't lose because its \"fun money\".\n\nI just see it as going out for a nice dinner with the wife. \n\nI am so strongly opposed to people in their late teens or early 20s throwing their entire savings, in potentially difficult times, into crypto. \n\nYes, it can pay off but it can also not or dip hard. At some point someone is going to lose out hard or find that getting money out of crypto isn't always easy with verifications and traders freezing accounts or being shady.",

Never. Doesn't matter if it's done it a million times before, there is *no guarantee* that it does it for number one million and one. \n\nCould Doge bounce back again? Absolutely! It may break $1 tomorrow. It could also crater back to being worth fractions of a cent tomorrow and never recover. Building hype is fine, but people acting like this is some guaranteed ROI is going to lose a lot of people a lot of money. Of course, they'll just say \"lol should have hodl no lose until sell!\" while people are out there still holding eight billion shitcoins that died - but hey, they didn't lose anything because they never sold, right?",

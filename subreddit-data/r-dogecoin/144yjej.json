Ugh. No really, I'm serious\n\nr/Bitcoin\n\nSeriously. This is good news for shibes.  We should be happy - just like the BTC maxis are happy. DOGE is not like XRP or the other 61 cryptos that the SEC is going after.\n\nAnd Binance? They were letting whales short DOGE! And to create false movement.\n\nNever thought I would say this but r/dogecoin should be responding a bit more like r/bitcoin This is good news for cryptos that:\n\na. want to be currency\n\nb. don't like people shorting their currency",

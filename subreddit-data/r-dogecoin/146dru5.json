This is happening right when the FEDNow program is about to be introduced.\n\nWe already know the banking crisis is most likely tied to this program, why not crypto.",

But I do think holding some doge/litecoin/bitcoin/ethereum accomplishes a modicum of push back against leaders who would abuse their authority by playing their political games using the country's currency as a tool for their agendas.\n\nHow does government crypto help the people in their pursuit of maintaining a balance of power with the government?\n\nAnswer:  It doesn't.",

And I'd like to mention, that while the original intent as I mentioned was balance of power between \"government\" and \"people\", \n\nit's my own personal belief that the balance of power has to be waged like this:\n\ngovernment/corporations/entities ---vs--- the people",

This is just the inverse of that. The pendulum is ALWAYS swinging. Stay cool, calm, and collected my friend. Get your dollar average down some more! That's how I view it at least.

It's mostly a popularity contest as far as I can tell. Lol. Mostly. Just stick with the few \"tried and true\" \"coins\" (I'm mostly in ETC, DOGE, and SHIB) and you should be good. \ud83d\udc4d Just average down for now if possible. I can't take advantage of this sale right now unfortunately. \ud83d\ude15 Unless it lasts till Friday! \ud83e\udd23",

Wall street has never paid shills to lobby against those... Somehow, Gensler is the first SEC chair that is attacked when he actually wants to enact stricter rules... Ask yourself why that is.\n\nif Gensler just did nothing, you would not see any opposition to him. He'd be doing what wall street and crypto firms want. Not necessarily what is good for us.",

I'm ready to hold parade.\n\nEdit: I wrote about why SEC news is ***good news*** for DOGE yesterday.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/142b0xd/comment/jn6clte/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/142b0xd/comment/jn6clte/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nTL;DR \n\n1. The DOGE devs have avoided the move to PoS for exactly this reason. PoS invites regulatory scrutiny\n2. What Binance was allegedly doing was helping the whales, specially the whales who want to short crypto. Shorting sucks.\n3. DOGE, unlike nearly other crypto, is trying to be used for purchases. The SEC doesn't care about that!  It's going after speculators who are evading US law via VPN\n\nThis is really, really good news.  Is it good for XRP? No.  For ETH? No. For DOGE?  **Yes it is.**",

Even with DOGE I definitely have a solid chunk of money because I invested just enough a few years ago (like 2-3K overall). \n\nI wrote it off as a loss that I'll likely never see back and just moved on to my full time job so I could grind hard and try to do well in my company (in progress, we'll see how that goes). But now, I'm just waiting and watching what happens with this thing because I'm just in shock that we got here in the first place. \n\nAnd to the people doubting me or saying it's fake, nothing is real on the internet, so I understand why there's doubt. I have no interest in sharing a screenshot of my total position, but you can have a rough approximation of how much I have now based on the amount I invested \"a few years ago\".",

New investors from SNL will see it 20c lower than the high and it will be more obvious than ever that the coin is on sale.\n\n3. Basically everyone who was educated about the situation predicted that it was going to fall WAY further than it did. If you look at previous spikes, the price almost always fell over 50% before climbing back up. In comparison, from 75c to 55c just ain't that bad.\n\n4. More and more hugely influential companies are coming out saying that they will accept dogecoin. That along with the looming announce that could come from Amazon accepting doge (not guaranteed) could easily shoot it up to above $3 in a matter of hours.\n\n5. Elon and others are working harder than ever to make Dogecoin the best currency in the world, through much faster trade times, along with the fact that the coin is not controlled by the government, makes it a much more appealing option than the US dollar and many other cryptos.\n\n\nWhile Doge began as a joke, and it's branding is based on a joke, the currency itself is not a joke anymore. It has a legitimate chance at becoming one of the best and easiest to use currencies in the world. TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n(not a financial advisor. just an idiot who likes doge)",

He said it\u2019s as real as that dollar which is true.  \n\nWe can\u2019t just skirt along with no challenges. Bitcoin was challenged and won. We were challenged tonight and came out ahead with a lot of newsworthy bits like his to the moon ending.  There will be a huge buzz the next few days and with that profits.",

Didn\u2019t see this one coming till American traders were awake. Oh well. Recovery in about 3-4 days. One last thing. It took us years to get where we are. This is not going away and there will be some healthy pullbacks every week or two. That\u2019s fine, for those lucky enough to buy them, awesome. For those who sell, never ever feel bad for taking a profit, however, the coin is not going anywhere.",

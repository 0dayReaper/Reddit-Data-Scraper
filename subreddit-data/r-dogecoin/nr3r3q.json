I realized something felt off and then I remembered that he was gone, not having him jumping all over me wagging his tail in so much joy to which even on my worst days at work, he would make me happy. I love animals too much as when watching war movies, I get scared for the horses possibly getting killed which would hurt me however, they can shoot all the people they want but don\u2019t they dare touch the horses. I will be honest here and say that if it wasn\u2019t for my current dog, I would have been gone forever almost 7 years ago when I was 2 seconds away from ending my life.",

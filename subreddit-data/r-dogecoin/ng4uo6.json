The hope is that this is the \"buy low\" time, and that there will soon be a \"sell high\" time.\n\nThat said, this sort of an attempt to time the market rarely succeeds.  Much better to buy incrementally over some period of time (a.k.a. \"dollar cost averaging\") and expect to hold for a period of months or years (a.k.a. HODL).\n\n*That* said, it's pretty disappointing that investor mentalities are flooding the community.  I guess a lot of folks saw dollar signs.  Can't blame 'em, but it's kind of a bummer.  I definitely miss the energy from 2013/2014, where we all knew full well Dogecoin was a joke and used it anyway - not with the expectation of making money, but with the agreement that it was cool and fun.",

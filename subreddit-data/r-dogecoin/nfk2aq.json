That lumber is solid because it was so old. Today's so-called lumber is grown from hybrid trees and it grows very fast so the wall street bosses  can get richer and richer while we build modern homes that Mother Earth blows down with little effort. BTW, it doesn't last  very long either.  The grains are much tighter on the older timber compared to the hybrid timber.  They have created a so-called shortage, using the pandemic for an excuse that has rewarded themselves handsomely .",

Then the customer can select what amount to transfer to you. Wallets allow you to choose USD amounts so you don\u2019t have to do the Doge conversion math yourself.\n\nYou just keep on the exchange and hodl.\n\nI hope that helped \ud83d\udda4",

YOU DO NOT own any cryptocurrency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood and send it to your own wallet for example, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. In addition to this, while Robinhood markets themselves on being \"fee-less\", you're actually paying above current market price when buying there, due to the way their order book is set up. You would never have that issue on a real exchange where the order book is completely transparent and the spread is visible.\n\nRobinhood has shown in the past over and over again that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies when the price starts to surge in either direction which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.\n\nIf you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. You can use https://simplecryptoguide.com/ to get started, it takes you through the process of buying on a real exchange (Binance) step by step, where you have full control over your funds. The articles in the guide should also answer most of the questions one might have starting out.\n\nDon't be too concerned if you've already registered on Robinhood, the process of starting over on Binance is very quick and easy using the guide. We want everybody with us buying of course, just not on Robinhood. It might feel like a bit of a hassle in the short term, but you're much better off in the long run.\n\nYou can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there.\n\nMore in-depth explanation here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n6i468/ditch_robinhood/",

Or do you immediately transfer to USD?\n\nIf the former, can you please answer what your max pain threshold is if Doge dips. For example, you sell 10000 hot doges this year at 1 Doge (0.50), and then doge dips to 0.25, your $5000 worth of product sold has turned into $2500. What would you do?\n\nEconomic theory teaches us that a currency has to be stable, and I think we all want that, otherwise it's total chaos.",

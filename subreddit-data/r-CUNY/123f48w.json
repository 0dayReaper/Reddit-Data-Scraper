I contacted my finaid department and this is what they had to say:\n\n&gt;\tGood Day,\n&gt;\n&gt;\tUnfortunately, part time TAP awards have not paid out yet. HESC is in the process of making internal decisions for the part time TAP and APTS recipients. We appreciate your patience in the mean time.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tIt's your decision if you would like to make a payment toward your balance. Once your part time TAP/APTS award pays, you will be reimbursed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\tSorry for the inconvenience.",

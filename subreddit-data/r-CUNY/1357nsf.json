I would recommend to accept your offer at hunter and wait until tomorrow to call Macaulay directly to make sure if accepting the offer at hunter also means you accepted the offer at Macaulay.",

If you got any freshreg emails asking to sign up, you\u2019re committed.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think you need to do anything special. Additionally I went to a Brooklyn infosession and they said all you have to do to accept the offer is press the single confirmation button on cunyfirst.\n\nThat being said I would still call just to make sure lol",

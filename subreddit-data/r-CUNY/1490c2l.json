    "postText": "So 2 semesters ago, I transferred to Hunter College as a Junior and only took one CS class, which I got an F in. As a result, my GPA became a 0 and I was on academic probation.\n\nLast semester, I took 3 classes, got 2 W\u2019a and one A-, which resulted in me being academically dismissed. Is there a way for me to ask my professor to curve or is it too late now? Also, how likely am I to get approved in my appeal?",

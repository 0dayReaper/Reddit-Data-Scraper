    "postText": "Hey guys,\nHow do we feel about the future of college and AI? There actually are pages on CUNY website which discuss how to use AI to your benefit in the classroom. My question is, Is blackboard equipped with the technology to detect AI in students assignments? Have you guys had any professors who used tools like ChatGPT for class instruction?\n\nSource: https://www.gc.cuny.edu/news/chatgpt-guidance-cuny-classroom",

They did not renew their contract with Blackboard, but I\u2019m sure they have ways to detect them to a certain extent. For how accurate it is, I do not know.",

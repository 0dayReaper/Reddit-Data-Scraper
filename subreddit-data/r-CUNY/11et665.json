    "postText": "hey, I'm a queens college student.\n\nI tried enrolling into 2 classes for the first 4 week summer session for summer 2023 (one 3 credit class and one 4 credit class). It said I can only enroll into up to 6 credits for the first 4 week summer session. Is there anyone I can email to allow me to be able to take more than 6 credits?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks in advance",

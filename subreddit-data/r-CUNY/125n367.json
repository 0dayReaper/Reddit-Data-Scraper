I just want your opinion on this. \n\nPs. Anyone know how long GC will take to finalize graduate applications ?",

But having never heard of the GC before applying I am wondering what the general reputation of it is. I know it\u2019s an R1, but in general would you consider it a good institution for graduate study?",

I had never heard of it either, but then I started to know many of the professors that work there and the school has a solid research reputation with resources to help you along the way in your professional/research pursuits.  The professors are very supportive and will help you with finding opportunities.  Many of them work at other schools.  One of my professors was a chair for a department at Hunter College.      \n\nHowever, and in higher education, pedigree matters, and it is a public institution, so it probably won't afford the same opportunities that a top private uni does.  Some schools may require phd students to teach, but the GC doesn't, last I checked. \n\nKeep in mind that each department kind of operates like an island, so some of this may change from one to the next, but on the whole I think it's a solid school and if someone is admitted into a MA or PhD program, I would recommend serious consideration.  I hope this helps.  Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions.",

I got accepted into a PhD program and ultimately I\u2019m just valuing the kindness and dependability of my potential principal advisor. I hear from others that having a good mentor and having other faculty interested in being on your committee can be more important than the prestige of the university. I am worried about funding my research a bit, but I\u2019m going to trust it\u2019ll work itself out.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to go back to school since leaving 7 years ago. I want to pursue nursing this time around, the first time I had focused on business courses. The way I dropped out messed up my overall gpa to about a 2.6 I think, and I\u2019ve already taken most of the introductory pre reqs already my first time going to college. My gpa for those is about a 2.7. I think there are still 1-3 pre reqs that I need to take, depending on the school, but I\u2019m worried that my overall gpa is still going to end up holding me back from any nursing program, including cc options. \n\nI\u2019m still waiting to hear back from a couple of cc, but I\u2019m wondering if they really are less competitive than other schools? I\u2019ve been accepted to york college and city tech but I\u2019m really stressing over whether or not there is any hope for me there at all. \n\nAny advice/insight would be so appreciated",

I\u2019m not 100% sure how 2nd degrees work, but I think you\u2019ll be able to take every kind of classes over again unless it\u2019s not taken before. By getting in some As, at least it could push your GPA to at least a 3.0, and then apply to the CC Nursing program.",

Wouldn\u2019t starting a \u201csecond degree\u201d still include classes I\u2019ve already taken? Unless my record/transcripts are wiped but how would that happen?",

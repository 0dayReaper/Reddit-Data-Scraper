Constant back and forth, but nope. And the last class we had students were asking about participation points, how they would be applied?. She said only a few students spoke up, they are the ones getting those points. Some sounded upset. But speak the fuck up. Maybe you understand something i don't, maybe i can explain something you did not understand.",

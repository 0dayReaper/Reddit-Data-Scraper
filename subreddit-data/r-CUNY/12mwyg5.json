    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m a current high school senior who is planning to commit to City College. The only problem is, when I applied, I applied undecided, and I want to do computer science. I\u2019ve heard that grove is kind of tough to get into, so what do you guys think I should do? I wasn\u2019t initially accepted to grove i don\u2019t think, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too late for me to switch my major or not. Help please",

The Grove school is very competitive and the amount of students who come in as a grove school major whether you\u2019re a freshman or transfer is rare. If you meet the eligibility requirements for the Grove school you should be able to switch I think. You can see the requirements on the Grove School site with a quick google search.",

Is it possible instead of taking calc 1 fall and calc 2 spring i could take calc 1 summer this year and calc 2 fall? And get ahead and hopefully be able to transfer for spring next year?",

CCNY is offering calc 1 over the summer  so that\u2019s a possibility just be mindful summer sessions are 8 weeks only so shorter than a regular academic semester. As well there is a pre-requisite for Calc 1. I believe there is a math placement test you would have to take to test into a math class I\u2019m not completely sure. I know when I started at cuny I had to take a math test and depending on  my score I was either placed in the math class for my major or a remedial math class to strengthen  my skill and retake the test again. I\u2019m not sure if math placement tests are still happening. Hopefully someone else who knows more about this comments. When you meet with an advisor to get advised on classes though  make sure to bring this up wanting to take calc 1 over summer with them so you get  advised properly.\n\nhttps://globalsearch.cuny.edu/CFGlobalSearchTool/CFSearchToolController\n( This is a site where you can see courses for all cuny schools i use it to see the courses I want it need to take for the following semesters and then enroll in cuny first. You can see the different calc options or just any other courses in general for city and every cuny)",

If you were not exposed to calculus in high school,  calc 1 might prove challenging due to the pace of the summer course. \n\nWhen I was a CCNY student, they had an accelerated Calculus series (Math 7 &amp; 8) instead of Calc I, II &amp; III.  Many CCNY engineering students are basically repeating Calc I and will do well compared to those students starting calculus in college.",

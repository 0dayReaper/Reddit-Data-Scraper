I will have two classes left, chem and calc, and I want to take calc in the summer because it not only is online (how I prefer instruction for math) but it helps lighten the load in the fall. So I want to know if I would get TAP for summer and fall, or would tap apply if FAFSA covered everything in the summer?",

Each school has different rules for how TAP works in the summer or for part-time enrollment so unfortunately your best bet is probably to reach out to the office of financial aid and ask.\n\nFor Pell, you need to register for at least 6 credits per semester in order to qualify.",

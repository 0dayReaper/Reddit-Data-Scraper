I\u2019ve only had a bad experience with like two or three and they generally have a doctorate or are pursuing doctorates. Enjoyed my time there and wish I could\u2019ve taken advantage of all the resources and education they had instead of slacking and pulling myself together the last year and a half.\n\nAlso, wanted to add that you shouldn\u2019t let others dissuade you from pursuing this path. There are many things you can do with a psych degree that isn\u2019t limited to research or clinical work. It is entirely up to you what you want to do with your degree and college education.",

As a fellow, CCNY has a good program and can help you but I also think you should be aware about your major. If you are taking it for just a bachelors degree, it might be difficult getting a proper salary job due to a saturated market. But if you are concentrating more and that might require a graduate degree as well, to have a better understanding of the field and proper career prospects. You can ask me more for specific questions?",

I am now in graduate school (at another institution) for school psychology, and I loved the psych program at queens. If you are willing to go to graduate school you can 100% make a career in psychology- you will have to look into 6+ years of schooling though and a minimum of a masters degree. Queens does have quite a few masters programs you could continue with thought out graduation, but I feel I was well prepared for graduate school and to further my education in psychology with my degree from Queens",

BA in Psych can be paired with other fields of study like marketing, political science &amp; education.\n\nWhereas, BS in Psych focuses is more on the scientific study &amp; research aspects of it. BS Psych students should expect hands-on labs, statistics &amp; specialized courses.\n\nI have a BA in Criminology, minor in Psychology from John Jay. I actually changed my major from Criminal Justice after taking a Sociology course with an amazing professor. Most of the Psych professors are really good &amp; they know what they are doing/teaching. Though, the professors who taught the math courses, they were real tough.",

Also, there was not a lot of professors teaching so that caused a lot of class cancellations and limited scheduling options. I would suggest choosing Hunter college instead. They have a big psychology program where they offer a wide range of diverse courses in Psych, and probably have numerous class sections available. However, both schools are suitable if you're interested in pursuing a career in therapy, research, premed, or other related fields.",

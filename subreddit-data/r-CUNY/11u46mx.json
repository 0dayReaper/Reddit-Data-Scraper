I had a really informative conversation with a F/A at my school. She said she advises students not to work if they can help it. She knows it's hard because everyone's circumstances are different and have to pay bills. My EFC is 0 and I get the max and don't have to take out any loans. I also get refunds. When I worked I had to take out loans. Hope this helps \ud83d\ude4f",

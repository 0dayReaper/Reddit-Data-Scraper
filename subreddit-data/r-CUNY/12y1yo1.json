    "postText": "I went to Queens College and graduated in Spring 2022. I was considering changing major to computer science several times throughout college, but that \"It's too late, I'm already too deep into this major. Just learn to love this one\" mindset won back then - helped by parents outraged at me saying I'm considering the change. I deeply regret not changing it now, and don't accept it. Is going back to get a new degree allowed?\n\nUntil the last semester of college it was a parent really choosing the classes and using degreeworks and everything until I got annoyed at them looking at things and changed the passwords and took control, so I barely really know how anything works. If I did go back, is it possible that I could use general education / \"core classes\" / whatever they were called that I already passed, along with taking summer and winter courses, to graduate in 3 1/2 or 3 years instead of it taking 4 years?\n\nWish I could go back in time. It wasn't even a full year of college yet when I started thinking of changing majors, but I never did. I lost half a decade. I'm about to become 24 now. What I thought was late was pretty early in comparison. Really upsets me. Going through college pages that might answer this just reminds me of this and depresses me so I'm just quickly throwing this question here and checking later. Idk what I'm doing.\n\nMy options are either going back to college to learn full time (faster) and getting a degree as a bonus, or learning slower because of an unrelated full time job and only being able to use my free time to learn instead of doing whatever I want - with no degree as well. I prefer the former.\n\nAnd yes, I know I won't get aid this time.\n\nDon't make the same mistake please.",

This time I\u2019m ready and know what I want out of it.\n\nWhat was your first degree in? You wouldn\u2019t need to retake general core like ENG 1&amp;2 again. \n\nYou would need to apply as a transfer student to the schools of your choosing and see if you get accepted. Once you\u2019re accepted they will evaluate what credits transfer over.",

You'll probably have to reapply to school but at this point you might even be better off just trying to do grad school in something more related to what you want to do. Most grad school programs, even specialized ones, don't really care about what you did in your undergraduate degree.\n\nDon't be so fatalistic about it, it really is not the end of the world.",

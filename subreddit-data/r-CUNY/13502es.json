    "postText": "Is the process of transferring from a SUNY(suny poly) to a CUNY(probably baruch/hunter) difficult?\nI\u2019m going an incoming freshman going to poly for fall 23\u2019. However due to financial reasons i\u2019m not sure if I can continue going to poly for all four years(dorming costs). \n\nI applied for 6 of the top CUNYs and got accepted into all, but I was wondering if I needed to transfer to a CUNY say my second year if I would run into any problems.",

Majority move off campus after freshman year, so the bulk of your debt will just be from one year. Upstate rent is cheap anyways with roommates",

I\u2019m not familiar with ur school and the area but I doubt you\u2019d pay more than 700 a month with roommates. And remember that is typically for a full year lease",

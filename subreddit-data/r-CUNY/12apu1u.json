It is challenging and competitive but it wouldn\u2019t be good if it wasn\u2019t and they have articulation agreements with some 4 year Cuny schools and non-Cuny schools you can see the full list on their site so you wouldn\u2019t lose any credits if you decide to get your BSN after. At BMCC you get the chance to take the NCLEX at the end I believe so you could start working as an RN while pursing your bachelors or even if you don\u2019t want to get your bachelors right away you can go straight into the work field.",

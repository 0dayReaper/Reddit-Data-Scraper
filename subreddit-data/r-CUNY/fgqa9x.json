The student wasn't on campus except Thursday evening for a class, but he/she was already asymptomatic (not showing signs of illness) at that point, right? Isn't it possible for virus transmission to still happen even when the person is asymptomatic?",

It's worded to sound like he showed up for one evening. Classes have been going on for weeks. And students use the library, advisement center, etc, beyond just going into a classroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a disease that spreads by droplets through the air, anyone in the room with this guy was exposed.",

She was on campus the week before that too, and possibly spreading the virus already at that point. CUNYs have failed us time and again and I\u2019m honestly not even surprised at this point. Does someone need to die for them to take action?",

The campus administrations are in fact relying on online classes and if a prof is balking they will put pressure on them in addition to the students putting pressure on them.",

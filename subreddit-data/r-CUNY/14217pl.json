    "postText": "Hi I read other threads talking about these schools' cs programs. The major overview I read was CCNY having the most reputable but cutthroat and competitive engineering program , Hunter having their program applied through a BA program behind not-so-great professors , and Queens having a mediocre to good review overall for CS. My main concern is whether majority of my math concentrated courses and algorithms classes will be elligible to transfer over. I understand CCNY requires Calc, Bio&amp;Chem(notsure both or one), and Physics, on my transcript prior BUT **with acceptance, will I automatically be placed in their Grove school?** Other threads make this program out to be difficult and competitive to get into... **Can anybody elaborate?**\n\nAlso Hunter having language and liberal arts requirements lowkey turns me off when I'm moreso focused on applied math, compsci, algorithms&amp;methods, etc. **Helpful insight from current or graduated Hunter students** is appreciated.\n\nQueens was never my first option but I'm willing to consider it for the sake of a program that offers more commitment to cs.\n\n\\&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm already aware CUNYs suck when it comes to their cs programs. Gotta play with the hand that you're dealt tho ;\\_;",

            "comment": "if you meet the grove reqs then you'll probably get in. searched for ya and theres a dude in a previous thread that got in as a transfer, here's what he said \n&gt; The requirements are two semesters of calculus I and II, calc based physics(C or higher in those classes). And a minimum gpa of 2.7 in the math and science courses. \n\nsomeone posted recently about running a transfer what if with hunter and most of their credits not applying or some thing like that, so i would check degreeworks to see if thatll be the case for you. and i know nothing about QC. good luck.",

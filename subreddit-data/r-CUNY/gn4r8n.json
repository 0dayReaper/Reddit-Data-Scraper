Cause I got a refund of financial aid and then I thought I was going to get another check which was the federal cares emergency grant. But that one never came so I talked to my bursar office and the guy said that my federal cares emergency grant combined with a student activity fee gives me the financial aid refund check that I got. But the Chancellor's email implied the federal cares emergency grant to be something different from regular refund since it's not a refund but rather a relief fund. Did anyone else have a similar situation? By the way my refund of financial aid was 1004.80 which I got and the federal cares emergency grant was listed at 990 which I didn't get but bursar said it was within the refund of financial aid.",

I see a $963 posted on my account, which shouldn't be it even if fees need to be taken out for a wire transfer. (I mean, unless a $287 fee is legitimate and that's my emergency grant... then I regret not going for a paper check.)~~\n\nedit: OK, apparently The Federal CARES Emergency Grant is federally funded and distributed by individual CUNY schools. Students have been qualified automatically based on FAFSA. More information on this [page](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresact.html). The varying amounts should be determined by our FAFSA.",

I actually need it. No offense to anyone but there\u2019s literally people in here that are CASHING OUT this aid because Pell already covers their tuition.",

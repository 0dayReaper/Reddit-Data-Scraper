Does anyone know how the hell I'm supposed to fill out A? As a permanent resident I don't get an I-94 but it is apparently required to fill that out. Any help? ",

If you don\u2019t have it, leave it blank?\n\nFor section A, answer all the questions accordingly.\n\nEdit to ask:\nWhy are you filling that document out?",

I\u2019ve been here for years and will stay here till the end of my days as a green card holder. I just answered the I-94 and all related questions with N/A. \n\nI\u2019m doing this form because I got accepted into the MARC program at hunter to do research and get a stipend for it. This is one of the forms I need to fill out.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nSo my dilemma is this: I live in nyc and have been a resident and working here for over a year, paying for my own apartment. My parents however live out of state and don\u2019t have ny ids so I am ineligible for TAP. \n\nThough I\u2019m currently working now I\u2019ll have less time to work during the Fall when I start school, so I am worried about being able to afford housing and food and whatnot. \n\nI am eligible for Federal Pell Grants that cover basically my entire tuition. My work (Chipotle) also has a scholarship, through Guild, I am eligible for which will provide me with about 5k for tuition. \n\nThis scholarship however would probably be taxable, and by accepting I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll just make me eligible for less Pell grants which I don\u2019t have to pay tax on. Yet, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anyway for me to have most of my Pell Grants sent to me and have my tuition be paid directly my scholarship. So I have money for rent and food. As guild always directly pays the college.\n\nIs this possible? Is there a way for me to become eligible for TAP? Should I just take out loans. Please let me know if this is possible or any advice. Thank you so so much. \ud83d\ude4f",

            "comment": "I don't think getting multiple scholarships will reduce this year's pell grant. Aside from that, you should start filing your own taxes separately from your parents,which will give you the opportunity to access TAP and other scholarships. \n\nAs for the state IDs, try to get one as soon as possible - you will need it for literally everything.\n\nAs for the taxability of Guild scholarship - the amount that is used to pay tuition, books or any other education related materials is NON TAXABLE. However, anything that's used for paying housing, living expenses WILL BE TAXED. So, everything sums up these points-\n\n(1) There is no way to get TAP, unless you qualify for it\n\n(2) Pell grant most likely will not get reduced in this tax year \n\n(3) Get a state ID - you'll need it.\n\n(4) Scholarship will be taxed only on the amount that was not     used for education, unless it's a non taxable scholarship.\n\nAlso, do visit the Financial Aid department of your school (always better than advice from random Redditor)\n\nHope this was helpful and all the best.",

I think there's something like that if you are a citizen and not living in nyc for a year they can give you the TAP. Just give them a call and tell them your situation and they can tell you if you're eligible or not.",

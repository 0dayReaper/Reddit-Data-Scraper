    "postText": "Basically, I\u2019m getting a little sketched out by one of my professors. This is for a gen Ed asynchronous class. Throughout the whole semester he has just been very rude and off putting in how he communicates with our class. He also NEVER returns grades, it\u2019s not even a feature on our class blackboard. He\u2019s extremely strict and work can\u2019t be submitted even a second late it all disappears right at the deadline. Now suddenly while I was going through the course evaluations for this semester his class is the only one that doesn\u2019t show up. I haven\u2019t encountered this before, is this allowed or can I contact someone about this cause I would really like to submit an evaluation on him\u2026?",

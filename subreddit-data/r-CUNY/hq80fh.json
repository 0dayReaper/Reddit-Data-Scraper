All my classes are still labeled as in person, so I hope that changes soon because even though it's my last semester, I will drop them if they're in person, it's not worth the risk.",

I really need to be hands-on with my lab courses since this summer I had a class that had a lab component and I missed out entirely on a physical aspect which is very important to the field I'm heading in. If not then that's okay I guess, the health of others is top priority.",

I honestly prefer the online lab class because it is safer even if its not hands on at the moment. No reason to risk permanent organ damage from corona.",

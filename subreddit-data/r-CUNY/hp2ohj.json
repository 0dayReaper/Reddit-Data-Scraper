    "postText": "CUNY keeps giving the impression that there will be a lot of classes that will still meet in person in the fall, especially general labs. \n\nIn order to meet safely in person, you need distancing, before anything else. You need a lot more than distancing, but you at least have to start with that.  \n\nDistancing means less people in the class, especially in the very classes everything thinks 'need' to be in person, like labs, there are no spare rooms to have the other half of class go into (and you'd need another prof for that room anyway, CUNY won't pay two profs to do one class).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLess people in class means the classes are capped at around 12 people. None of the classes in CUNYFirst right now have been capped at 12 people or any other kind of reduced class size.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO just remember that, whatever happens, they've had months to plan it, and they haven't actually spent even a minute at CUNY Central thinking about any of this.  No matter how much you dislike online classes, and there's legit problems that come with it, the campuses will not be safe for you to go into in person.",

The messaging is super vague and unhelpful.\n\nIt is worth noting though that they are doing a lot of planning behind closed doors. My dad is an educator and knows that statewide schools are working through different scenarios. It's just not frontward-facing, for better or for worse.",

CUNY admin should be purchasing masks, hiring custodians, stocking disinfectants, labeling floors with directional routing, installing plexiglass barriers, capping class sizes, purchasing thermometers for screening, etc. They've done none of that. They also could show some actual leadership, look at the fact that infections are skyrocketing everywhere, and say that the campuses can't be made safe and classes will be online regardless of whether the state gov clears them. \nAgain I've seen departments do a lot, especially given that CUNY central has provided no actual guidance besides hand wringing over synchronous vs asynchronous and hasn't released or even revealed any funding, but above the level of departments, it's a void, they've passed the buck.",

It wasn\u2019t until I checked cuny first when I realized that I was accepted. If that\u2019s not the case for you, I would recommend calling the admissions office at Brooklyn since most acceptance letters should be out by now (except if you were waitlisted).",

However you will need to contact the SEEK Office in regards to your status.\"",

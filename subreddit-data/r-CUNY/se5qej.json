    "postText": "I beg of you, for the love of chocolate chip cookies and kittens, PLEASE do not leave things to the last minute. \n\nBy filing for and requesting stuff at the last second, you're leaving yourself zero time to fix issues that come up. Let's say you need to get a copy of your official transcript for something and you need it by Feb 1. Today is January 27 and you filed your transcript request today. CUNY is on a Mon-Fri 9-5 schedule. Which leaves less than three working days for CUNY to get that out for you. But you have a bursar hold on your account which stops all other transactions (including course registration, graduation, and more) and you can't get the transcript unless you pay whatever you owe. Assuming you have the ability to pay it off immediately, you do so and now you have to wait for the bursar office to clear the hold, which doesn't happen right away because the payment needs to actually clear. So now you've lost one, possibly even two working days and it's now January 31. The Registrar still has to print up and mail out your transcript. USPS takes maybe three days to get mail from A to B. So the soonest you or the other party can receive the transcript is February 4, three days past the deadline. And that's if *everyone* involved is on point at every step of the way and *if* they can focus only on you, which only happens in unicorn land.  In reality land, that's just not how it works. \n\nFor your own sake, look at your CUNYfirst student center every week, stay on top of all your administrative tasks, read and follow instructions when they're given to you, and please plan far ahead and leave yourself a LOT of time to fix any potential speed bumps. Assume that everything at CUNY will happen at a snail's pace and plan for it to take twice as long, because that is the godawful truth. Most of us are trying our best to get you what you need but we can only work with what we have when we get it. Leaving stuff to the eleventh hour only hurts *you*.",

Everytime I\u2019ve spoken to someone I\u2019ve been told to wait or to speak to someone else. \n\nIt\u2019s always a run around. CUNY students try their best to keep on top of things but realistically enough, if it\u2019s a high volume of students with multiple problems and barely any representatives to help, shouldn\u2019t the schools be on top of this too? Also having more effective deadlines for students/staff so everyone doesn\u2019t scramble to make sure things are in order. \n\nThe problem is the cuny system, not the staff not the students.",

I hope that most people stay on top of their responsibilities.\n\nOn a different note, I think that CUNY also needs to work harder at preparing students for the start of the semester, ESPECIALLY during a global pandemic. I am a transfer student this semester, and was unable to reach my advisor/ receive helpful information. I was told that I couldn\u2019t register for classes until I was accepted into my program, and as a junior transfer student, the only classes I needed to take. In turn, I had to register for classes very late, and wasn\u2019t able to choose when/what I took but what was left. Another annoyance, the complete lack of clarity when it comes to booster paperwork. And trying to get ahold of anyone to answer your questions is quite honestly a joke.\n\nI know you are saying that people need to stay on top of their business, but so does CUNY. It\u2019s sucks that they don\u2019t help organize these things better to make your job easier, and ours, as students, lives a little easier as well.",

    "postText": "I attend LaGuardia community college and took a English class over 14 years ago at a different college and it transferred . I\u2019m trying to get into the rad tech program. Since then Ive taken this class over and will receive an A. My key course would be a 3.6 with the new grade . However the health science department said they would calculate my old grade from 14 years ago with my new one making my gpa a 3.3 with the key courses. Is there any way around this ? It\u2019s totally unfair and I\u2019m not sure what to do ? I tried reaching out to the radiology chairman and health science chairman and they haven\u2019t gotten back to me . I\u2019m not sure what to do ? Can someone help advise me please ?",

            "comment": "There isn't really much that can be done because when you retake a course, it just gets averaged in with the old grade and the new grade doesn't replace the old one. \"If I fail a course, am I able to retake it? Students could retake a pre-clinical course if they received a grade of C- or below in the course. However, both final grades will then be averaged in consideration for candidacy.\" ([https://www.laguardia.edu/radiologic-technology/](https://www.laguardia.edu/radiologic-technology/)). \n\nHonestly, the only thing you can really do is apply and see if you are accepted. If not, maybe switch to another college that offers rad tech. Also, I'm not sure if you know (or if it matters to you) but LaGuardia's Rad Tech program isn't accredited. All the other CUNY colleges that have rad tech programs are all accredited except for LaGuardia.",

I just got into the clinical portion of the radiologic technology program at Hostos. They factor in your who,e academic background not just how you did in the core classes associated with the program.",

I want to say it\u2019s yes with 3.0 it\u2019s a guarantee but I can\u2019t as I don\u2019t make the decisions. However to be granted entry and if you\u2019ve fulfilled all the prerequisites like have at least a B in A&amp;P 1 and 2 , Mathematics for allied health and I think there\u2019s another one\u2026 but once you\u2019ve done all of that securing a seat in the clinical portion is a strong yes. There\u2019s just that one year wait which sucks\u2026",

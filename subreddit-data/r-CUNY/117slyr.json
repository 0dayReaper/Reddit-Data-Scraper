    "postText": "My prof graded something of mine on BB Grades, there is a number value and it says \"Graded\" and is included with the other graded assignments. Yet it still has that yellow exclamation which indicates that it needs to be graded. I'm assuming it's just a little bug and nothing to worry about but anyone know? Maybe it has something to do with the grade being part of a weighted average that has not been calculated yet?",

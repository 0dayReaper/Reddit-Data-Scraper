    "postText": "I\u2019m 17 and homeless and I just want to get an education. \n\nBut I\u2019m pretty sure the universe is telling me not to get one. \n\nAll my life all I\u2019ve wanted is to get an education so I can live my best life. \n\nI ended up homeless just because I wanted an education. Instead of dropping out of high school at 16 to become a housewife, I busted my butt and graduated early behind my family\u2019s back. Long story short my mom tried to kill me and now I\u2019ve been homeless for over a year living between shelters and the streets. \n\nI don\u2019t know why. But for some stupid reason I had this thought that if I work hard enough and stay focused I could get somewhere with it. \n\nI made sure I did so. I graduated as valedictorian and applied to every college I could,tried to find odd jobs, transferred from shelter to shelter every time my time limit ran out and every single thing I could think of to do. Even asking strangers to no avail if I could just sleep on their floor until I got myself together. \n\nAnd then I believed that I could possibly escape homelessness through school!\n\nThat I could take out a student loan for my first year so that I could finally have my own bed and roof to sleep under for once so I could already be 18 and get up on my feet and strive!\n\nBut again the universe disagrees. \n\nAnd my TAP got denied and I can\u2019t pass FASFA verification because I can\u2019t prove my residency\u2014 because I\u2019m homeless. \n\nI don\u2019t want a pity party. This is more-so a rant/realization. \n\nI\u2019m realizing that even though I didn\u2019t live in a great home I gave up having my own bed to sleep in just for this. That I missed the one opportunity to be with my grandma\u2014 the only one who truly cared for me who passed in March just for this. And so much more. \n\nAnd I truly don\u2019t even know what to think at this point. \n\nPerhaps being smart isn\u2019t always about having an education, but instead realizing what\u2019s around you is as good as it gets.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t the college. It IS my fasfa. I have already applied for both TAP and fasfa. The issue is because I\u2019m homeless at 17 I had to apply as an independent. Because of that they made me verify it. I submitted all the information required yet it\u2019s changed nothing. \n\nIf my TAP and fasfa were approved I would be able to attend my school with no issues and money leftover.",

Moreover, there are a few soup kitchens operating at the moment. For M-F, there are free school meals being given out at certain public schools and it's open for all to recieve. Since they're designed for schoolchildren, they're all ready-made. If you haven't contacted your school's scholarship office, you should. If they're good, they'll have tabs on all sorts of niche/specific scholarships. Finally, if you need help with housing, there're a few scholarships for that. Idk what school you attend but at CCNY, you can apply for housing grants supplied by the LCU Fund for Women's Education.",

I am supposed to attend Lehman. Unfortunately they have no housing scholarships. Best they could suggest was to apply for fasfa and take out a loan, then contact them once the loan came through",

I studied math and computer science in the earlier parts of my life and had to take the general science classes for those degrees' requirements. I always had a passing interest in biology and decided to take on a biotech associates at BMCC. I've taken Bio 210 (first bio class for science majors) and Bio 220 (second bio class). These are serious science classes... my first lab was like \"this is how we convert in metric\" and my second lab was \"let's play with some seriously strong acids and bases and investigate them\" which was already more intense than anything I did in my general science requirement classes from earlier in my life--I seriously learned more chem in those bio classes than I did in my general chem class when I first went to college.  \n\n\nSo yeah you can take those serious major classes at a community college. You can even talk to Lehman (or elsewhere) and ask them what programs at which community colleges would best prepare you.",

If it doesn't work out this semester, do what you can to stay afloat and try again in the spring (this is very common). It sounds like you have all it takes to succeed, and your current troubles are not a reflection of who you are.   \n\n\nI strongly disagree with your advisors that community college is not beneficial. For personal reasons, I started at community college (also having AP credits) and went on to finish my PhD at a top school.  \n\n\nA community college is a great place to get started, especially if there is a financial or other reason that makes a 4 year school the wrong choice at this time.  \n\n\nWe have tons of community college transfers at my CUNY, and there are plenty of strong and talented students among them.  \n\n\nSo that you don't waste credits, focus on taking flexible common core courses that are required at all CUNYs. I bet a number of these courses will not be satisfied by AP credits (but check this against the AP courses that you have). After these courses, pick the school to which you want to transfer and take courses that will definitely transfer there. There are standard English and math courses that are a very safe bet for transferring (you might have AP credit for some but not all of them). Many programs have a foreign language requirement, which is something you can take at a community college.\n\n[https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/undergraduate-studies/pathways/gened/flex-commoncore/](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/undergraduate-studies/pathways/gened/flex-commoncore/)  \n\n\nFeel free to send me a message and if you would like I can help you determine which AP courses will transfer as what and which courses you still need to take.",

And if that doesn't work, you can call your senators' offices. Call on Monday if you can, early.\n\nIf those don't work, and you're comfortable with it, you can call the local news agency and ask if they can give you some help by shining a light on the situation.",

Youre going to do so fucking well in college, you care so much about your future, more than half the people i meet.\n\nI had a slightly similar situation as you do 11 years ago, except i did shitty in hs, i had to start at community college. Qcc is an experience i will never forget because i was constantly told i would never get into college, go to college, never do amount to anything, etc. \n\nI dont know what school youre in or if youre receiving anything but. If money is a massive issue please consider cc as well. Obviously a lot of kids going to cc are either being forced by parents or truly dont give a shit and want free money from fafsa, but, i really cannot express how much it has helped me realize my full potential. You can get transfer scholarships to like any college too. Esp since it would be an absolute breeze for you to knock general education requirements and graduate maybe even earlier. If you have above a 3.5 gpa you can do a credit overload, i did for 1 semester, it was fine for me to manage (3.3 gpa - a science course screwed me). If class is a breeze for you, you can dedicate more time and energy for your current situation. Please utilize the counseling centers and career development offices too. Study abroad options as well, get even farther away for the price of cuny tuition. \n\nIve met the most genuine and amazing people at qcc too, and professors (one works at qc now). It helped me understand life isnt a race, i can change careers at any age if i decided to (i might idk), i related to lots of people more at qcc than the school i got my BA in, etc. \n\nI do hope this helps a little bit. I wish you the best, youre going to do amazing things regardless of what you do, because youre resilient as fuck.\n\n*ive seen your other responses with concerns due to transfer credit. How many AP? Have you asked admissions at CC's how many credits they can take overall? You may graduate with an AA faster than the average person. If you have 40+ credits already, that is what i see as a disadvantage, however certain colleges take up to 90 credits or unlimited (hunter and baruch)\n\nI suggest maybe seeing how many transfer credits CC can take. If the ap scores are in cunyfirst then you dont have to resend them and colleges should be taking unofficial transcripts if you didnt send them, esp bc of your circumstances. I dont know if this helps but, if you want to start college NOW, you either wont get your tap/fafsa processed until your situation is sorted out (contact directors and deans about your situation and ask for payment extensions. Have proof prepared), or you may have to take 1 semester at a CC, take a couple of courses that you need towards the cuny common core requirement, then transfer for spring 2021.",

Some CUNY senior colleges will give credits for some CC courses that other CUNY senior colleges won't give credit for.  Also, it is not necessarily the case that if a CC gives credit for an AP then the senior college will too after the student transfers.  Being in the Bronx is useful because the three Bronx CUNY colleges (Hostos, Bronx Community College, and Lehman) are working well together on transfer.  For information on how specific CUNY courses will transfer from one CUNY college to another, check out CUNY's Transfer Explorer: [https://explorer.lehman.edu/](https://explorer.lehman.edu/) .  Anyone can use Transfer Explorer; you don't have to be enrolled at CUNY to use it.",

These offices have people available to help folks out in various situations. Hopefully this doesn't result in some stupid part of the system forcing you back with your family, but given the seriousness of that outcome I doubt that would happen.\n\nIt might come down to the fact that you should wait a year. What do you want to study at college? Maybe you can get a paid internship / etc before college in your field even if it's just minimum wage. Being in a shelter does present difficulties but hopefully if you have work you can find a permanent place to live and then start paying rent with financial aid while in school later.",

They have a more scientific route and a medical route I was planning to take which involves nursing classes and more. I was also considering CCNY but they aren\u2019t as savings savvy. Before all of this Covid stuff started I spoke with advisors about what I wanted and I decided going to a community college wouldn\u2019t be very beneficial as I already have taken advanced placement courses and when I transferred id have to waste too good amount of credits. In my situation it\u2019s obvious I don\u2019t have that option. \n\nYes I have gone to the door. It isn\u2019t much of a help all in all. I\u2019ve been in nearly every youth shelter in the city and looked at their resources. Most of the other homeless kids who where in college or where trying to get into it either dropped out or gave up. Understandably. \nAnd honestly with the rate CUNY is at right now, attempting to switch wouldn\u2019t even work. So I\u2019d rather not do that. If my stuff doesn\u2019t come through it\u2019s just time to re-evaluate entirely. \n\nGenuinely, when I say I\u2019ve tried everything, I really really have. \n I have heard people give me their advice for months and while I do appreciate it, it\u2019s the same advise over and over again typically from a quick google search and I have tried them all. \n\nUnless a miracle happens and my stuff passes verification and or someone offers me a bed and a job paying thousands much isn\u2019t going to happen. I\u2019m still hoping the first one happens (the second is just stupid). \n\nWhen I turn 18 I\u2019ll have more options to jobs so hopefully I\u2019ll have a better chance at finding one. But I don\u2019t think\u2014 well actually I won\u2019t be stupid again then and try to continue my education. If it isn\u2019t meant to be it just isn\u2019t. No matter how angry or upset that makes me I have to accept it. \nThank you though.",

I went to college in 1999 and there was a hiccup and I didn't get my degree until 2010. Like the comment below, you can study phlebotomy among other routes.\n\nA lot of young people also want to \"just get school done with\" and rush through things, but again you have a lot of time ahead of you so don't pressure yourself into rushing through life. This might be especially important for you because you have some traumatic experiences to work through and so while you're working on your education you might also want to work on your psychological, emotional, social, and physical well being regarding that trauma and its after affects: self care is important.",

And education that is. \nSomethings are not meant to happen. \nTime is a big thing. We will never know how much we have or don\u2019t have. I learned that when both my grandma died and a homeless friend I used to sleep next to on the subway never woke up because of how cold it was. But I do know I won\u2019t waste the rest of my time like I have trying to do this. \n\nThe way I see truly has nothing to do with the age of the person telling me advice. I have always liked to hear advice, it gives a different perspective on things. \n\nSelf care is important to me. But unfortunately ones best self care comes when they can physically be comfortable. I was hoping my escape from poverty was my education. If it is not that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll figure out a way",

You will soon learn that society and government hate homeless people.  You have to have an address for nearly everything . I have slept on the streets before and people don't regard you as human. You can't get work either which only enables a system where having so many people sleep on the streets is acceptable .  I know people with masters that live below the poverty line.  Sorry you experience and I can't tell you anything positive.  You are just a number to CUNY as I have experienced .",

(Kingsborough and LaGuardia don't start until September 12, so you still have time to apply -- but the deadline is in a few weeks.)\n\nAlso, you CAN submit a FAFSA.  You need to financial aid office of the college you apply to to complete a form confirming that you are homeless. The form can be found here: [https://nche.ed.gov/higher-education/](https://nche.ed.gov/higher-education/)\n\nIf you want to wind up as a PA, you can major in biology at the community college and transfer all your credits to a senior CUNY college.",

I am a criminal justice student. We will not recover for at least a year or two. Thats a fast time for NY. Find a job with a trade. You'll make way more money. You'll care. Focus. If you are book smart. You'll even become your own boss.\nWhy?\nThe minute this economy crashes. Which i hope i don't. \nTRUMP knows it as well, which is why he signed the executive orders today. \nTrades will be the majority of jobs. While every one gets grades.while in 100k+ debts. You'll be in 20k debt the most which you'll be able to pay off in less than a year and make a profit. Trust me. I'm not talking out of my ass. \nWhy? \nEvery one needs electricity. If it fails?\nEvery one needs a home..if it fails?\nPlumbing?\nAC?,heat? \nWe are in the middle of a world disaster. Do you think PhDs can resolve those problems?\nGet your hands dirty, be tire as F the first day. After the FIRST job. You'll realize how proud it makes you. While earning a good pay. Don't get me wrong is hard work. But if you don't do it. Some one will. \n\nUnemployment fine. But you will rather make 400 a week. Or finish a job in less than 3 days. While earning twice the profit?\n\nI'm looking fot a trade after covid. We will not get back to normal if my point of view, until the middle of 2021 or beginning of 2022. By that time you could become your own boss. If you can manage your money",

BMCC would be better in terms that you would be paying a lot less but if you want to pursue more than a 2year degree, that also gives csi an advantage as you won\u2019t have to transfer out etc",

Attendance demands will also be critical. CSI has a beautiful campus indeed. But travel will ALWAYS be a factor unless you live on S.I. Think carefully and ask yourself what matters most for the long haul.",

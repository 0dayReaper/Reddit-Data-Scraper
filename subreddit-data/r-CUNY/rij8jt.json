Wait until the last possible second (Like January 25th or something) to decide to move stuff back online.\n\nI don't know which one to expect. But I got my booster and am wearing my K95 in the meantime....",

We can't get rid of it, that possibility is long gone. Unless some variant happens that is way more aggressive and starts killing vaccinated people at a high rate, I don't think we will see another shutdown. I think for the next few years we're just gonna have to buckle down, wear masks, and stay up to date on our vaccines.",

What a lot of people, especially the \"you're just fear mongering\" crowd, are missing is that with every variant the virus is evolving and adapting. Right now you can get double pneumonia, scarred lung tissue, and all the other fixings. \n\nThat already sounds terrible. You want to keep giving this thing the opportunity to do worse? Yeesh.",

And if you think for a second that if the people who died got a second chance to be a little more careful about COVID, wouldn't be a little more careful, you're 100% wrong. \n\nLife is short people. If there's an alternative, like online learning, there is no reason to be risking our lives. And for the record, I prefer in-person classes. McGraw Hill and Cengage are god awful.",

            "comment": "I can help especially for biology, I work in the biology office(: there\u2019s so many research and internship opportunities especially for biology students, as they make over half of the division of science students, while at CCNY the classes are rather rigorous so if you\u2019re looking for something easy then CCNY unfortunately isn\u2019t for you, professors will really push you to study and do a lot, over preparing you for when you leave CCNY and do whatever it is you want to do, with this in mind the professors are very friendly and the staff that work in the biology office are as well and are more than happy to assist and help you anyway we can, as for study abroad i think there are opportunities there as well, for example as a chemistry major there is currently a program running allowing those selected to attend a nuclear chemistry class in California along with a stipend and for biology I have a friend this past winter that went abroad to study in Thailand (he\u2019s also a biology major) if you\u2019re interested in opportunities like that refer to the ccnyabroad Instagram page",

As for social life many will say it\u2019s terrible but it\u2019s so easy to make friends just go up to people and talk to them honestly easiest way to make friends, especially in class considering everyone is struggling, what better situation to bond over? Reach out to classmates study together go out to eat it\u2019s simple really (I\u2019m quite the social butterfly if you couldn\u2019t tell).  CCNY has its own on campus housing called the towers, I\u2019ve never been but the building does look pretty nice, you can find reviews online somewhere probably. Job placement is good too especially if you\u2019re doing work study, I don\u2019t do work study the bio office was looking for an assistant and I asked and here I am but there\u2019s plenty of opportunities all you need to do is look and ask.",

(Just remember there are so many students and it's not like there's a 1:1 direct ratio of resources to students.) \n\nSo if I were you, don't put all your eggs in 1 basket aka the CCNY basket. Look for opportunities \\*now.\\* Get a head start now. IDK if you ever heard of the catch-22. You want opportunities but you don't got experience. You want experience but you don't got opportunities. You need to start now - network into the first opportunity, internship, volunteer, etc. Reach out to meet people. Ask if you can work on projects together, get work experience, etc. \n\nThe one thing you gotta do while at CCNY is figure out quickly if you want to study what you think you want to study. Time is limited. Financial aid is limited. Faculty, staff, and advisors aren't all-knowing so they don't always know the best route.",

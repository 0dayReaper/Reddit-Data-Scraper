If you fail 101, during the check they\u2019ll remove 102 from your course list for the summer since you didn\u2019t pass 101 which is a prerequisite. I don\u2019t think they do holds.",

They allow you to register for classes that require a prereq if you're taking the prereq in the current semester, but if you fail, they take the class off your schedule. I saw that email and was confused like.. people don't know this? Why would they let you take a class that requires a class you haven't passed? Common sense.",

If that does exist, it doesn\u2019t need to pass degree works. \n\nHowever, there is a limit of how many credits can transfer and if they are deemed equal to each other. I went from KBCC to Baruch and had to retake accounting because it was not equal.",

You may be bringing in more credits that the community college can accept upon transfer, in which case you may be able to count more of them once you go back to a bachelor's program.  In addition to speaking with an advisor, you may also find this tool to be of use, [Transfer Explore](https://explorer.cuny.edu/)r (T-Rex).",

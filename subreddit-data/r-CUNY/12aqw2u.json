            "comment": "The way that CUNY systems work is that you apply to CUNY and not the school directly. CUNY does a rolling admission so it\u2019s typically a couple of weeks before there is any update. On average, people receive their decisions 6-8 weeks after they receive all information ie transcripts etc. after CUNY has everything and process, they will send it to the specific college you applied to, and then they go through their own separate admission process. Once they receive it, it\u2019s usually only a couple of days after that you receive the email. I applied on October 31st and got my decision mid February. \n\nSo short answer, yes it\u2019s normal. If you were rejected, you would still get an email stating that.",

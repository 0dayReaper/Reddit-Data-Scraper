I was hoping for a more traditional and academic approach to the subject, but instead encountered individuals who seemed more focused on complaining about the world than on the material itself. However, I do believe that the major has made improvements over the years and may offer a more rewarding experience now.",

I've watched so many movies lol the topics are super interesting and the professors I've had don't overdo it with essays(i DETEST essays) so I'm glad for that.

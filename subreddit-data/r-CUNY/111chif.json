            "comment": "The main way CUNY seems to be responding to this is to cut back on the number of Adjuncts.\n\nAdjuncts teach about 70% of the courses at CUNY and most other non-CUNY colleges, so I don't know how that is supposed to work. Adjuncts don't hang around without classes to teach, they're basically fully employed teaching. To cut them would mean canceling classes, which contributes to lower enrollment in the end. Right now they're running classes with a handful of people in them, those used to be canceled and they might be returning to that.  \nThey could also add more online classes, which tend to get completely filled to the brim. That would help enrollment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're basically going to have to shoot themselves in the foot for a year or two to meet the 'savings' requirements that the (dumb) Adams admin has invented, lose students, lose adjuncts and staff, and then try to fix it after that.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! Currently a high school senior who graduates in june, starting around late august at a community college. I chose a community college so i can take required core classes for a \" cheaper price \" as you can say. I'm planning to do business administration / marketing as a major. While finishing my required core classes at cc, i'm planning to transfer to baruch. How would the transfers work? what classes would you recommend taking at cc that transfer to baruch? I'm personally not a huge fan at math, but the business industry just amazes me somehow, does anyone know the required courses ( mainly math ) that transfer to baruch? i have a lot of questions because it seems confusing to me",

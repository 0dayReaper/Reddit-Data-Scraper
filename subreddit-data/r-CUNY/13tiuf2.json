But\u2026I\u2019m supposed to graduate this semester. If he doesn\u2019t post it till Tuesday, can I still graduate on time? Has anyone experienced this before? \n\nI emailed my advisor but hoping for some insight before she gets back to me next week.",

You don\u2019t get your degree during ceremony anyway so technically even if you failed the class you\u2019ll still walk across the stage( but it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t fail lol)",

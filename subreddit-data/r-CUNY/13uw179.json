    "postText": "Not sure if this is possible\u2026.\n\nI want to drop by a few CUNY colleges soccer matches this fall to photoshoot the games for portfolio purposes. \n\nCollege athletes LOVE images of them playing their sport. I have fun snapping away. \n\nI use expensive equipment. At times, school safety officers can be annoying. Once in a while, some sport\u2019s athletic staff will ask for me to join the fans on the benches.  \n\nA lot of the players love seeing their images from a good vantage point which is behind the pitch.\n\nA school safety officer advised me to get a press pass from CUNY, this will allow me to have free roam and no one to bother me. \n\nHow can I begin this process?",

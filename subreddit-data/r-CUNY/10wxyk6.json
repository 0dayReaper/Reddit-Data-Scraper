    "postText": "I work as an intern in a RFCUNY project and they have been owing me wages since December 18th 2022. I filed a complaint to Department of Labor and New York State Attorney General. Is there other things I can do? Their attitude is unbelievable, the payroll talked to me like it was my fault that I didn't get paid, saying the hours I entered is wrong so I didn't get paid, and then the HR said it was my work authorization blah blah blah. But I didn't even have access to the time and leave system, and I never have my work authorization expired. So like how do I pay rent??",

CCNY is also a good choice but BC Graduate program is highly regarded so I wanted an easy transition. I also met with the faculty and sat in all the info sessions they had. I was impressed by the faculty.",

It's a lot more accessible than the actual campus. They also have a whole film studio there. It's pretty cool.\n\nhttp://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/schools/mediaarts/schools/feirstein/facilities.php",

Lehman is also not bad but Brooklyn\u2019s film program is fantastic with strong industry connections and gives you a nice on-ramp to their Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema which has a wonderful facility at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. \n\nCCNY\u2019s program is solid, but not as good as Brooklyn\u2019s, and Hunter is second- or third-tier for film, at best.",

That\u2019s a possibility, too, and Lehman is a very strong program and getting better every year.",

As with any major it's really about the student but the Arts are a little different because networking plays a major role in work after you graduate.

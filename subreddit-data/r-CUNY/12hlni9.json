            "comment": "The Nursing programs ar CUNY are competitive and selective. You don't get admitted directly to the programs. You take the pre-req and you apply. If you meet the requirements then you get admitted. You should also be aware that getting admitted doesn't mean you stay admitted and graduate. You can get kicked out if you don't maintain the requirements. So make sure to ask student in programs their experience. I've heard great things about BMCC but horrible things about KCC.",

(Dental programs especially) Also staff is not helpful at all, advisors milk things to keep you at the school even know it sucks. TAP will be cut off without awareness.

For my cohort, no one had a GPA lower than 3.75 or a HESI score of less than 92. Once admitted, you take one 8 credit nursing course per semester, except for the last semester where you take two courses, one that is 8 credits and the other is 2 credits.",

Once in the program, I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s a lot of work. Especially if you have a full-time job or have kids. For example, I work full-time and I\u2019m drowning. If you\u2019re just a student, you will have it easier IMO, but that is only if you\u2019re dedicated. You have to study and you\u2019re going to have to be okay not having a social life for while. We have an exam almost every 2-3 weeks. You cannot fail the Fundamentals course, you can only withdraw if you fail like you won\u2019t pass. They\u2019ll give you a second chance to enroll the following semester, but if you fail that too then that\u2019s it. The only really good thing about the nursing program at BMCC, is that the lowest grade you can get is a C, which is unheard of. Most nursing schools require a B at the minimum.",

You can start working as an RN at some facilities with just the ADN/license. Then transfer to an RN to BSN program, which many are entirely online, making it a great option for working nurses. Hunter offers an RN to BSN program and so does SUNY Downstate, to name a few. And if you play your cards right and take the BSN prerequisites (like Statistics, Nutrition and Pathophysiology) while doing your ADN at BMCC not only will it save you money, but it will save you time once you\u2019re in the Bachelor program, meaning you can get your BSN in 1 year or 3 semesters. So 4 years total from start to finish if you\u2019re starting from scratch.",

    "postText": "I have been accepted for transfer to both, and I'm torn between which to commit to. From what I've read Hunter has a damn good English program, but Queens is considered THE teacher ed school of CUNY. I'm currently leaning towards Queens, but is there any reason I should more strongly consider Hunter? Should it just be whichever I can find housing with?\n\nI was also accepted into Brooklyn and CCNY, if I should be considering either, though from what I've read it doesn't seem like it.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, I'm a little lost.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m gonna say go with Hunter, especially if this is for undergrad. I say this because, you eventually need a masters degree to teach in New York State. Hunter is known to be a lot less selective with acceptance into their Masters programs. Queens College programs are super competitive and that kills the experience of any college (trust me I come from Baruch which was terrible.) Plus QC has way too many requirements. \n\nAt the end of the day, teaching is one of those jobs where the only thing that matters is the certification. They don\u2019t care where you got the degree, it\u2019s all about state certification. I know so many people at Hunter and they all had great experiences. I say give them a try if you want to have the smoothest experience and eventually get into a masters program.",

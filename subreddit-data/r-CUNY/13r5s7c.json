    "postText": "I wanted to ask here before wasting anyone's time in the school because I'm not entirely sure how this works. Can I return after receiving my associate degree, say, a year or two later, to pursue my bachelor's degree? Additionally, if I use my credits to obtain my associate degree in one field even though \u00a0it overlaps with another degree that I want to obtain also later on, would I have to retake any classes?",

That\u2019s something which has just started so it isn\u2019t fixed yet but hopefully within a year or so. \n\nMeanwhile the cuny transfer tool will probably answer some of your questions \n\nhttps://explorer.cuny.edu/",

            "comment": "If you stay within CUNY you will get a transfer evaluation done on your credits. General requirements will almost always transfer over. Major requirements not always so. For instance i have an associates in mental health and in the fall i will start a bachelors of psychology. Some of my mental health classes were equivalent to a requirement for the bachelors, some were not. The good thing is those classes are now considered electives so you dont lose any credit progress, you may just have to do a class that seems similar to one you already completed for associates. A lot of times that is due to department requirements of curriculum but it on average would be a couple of classes, not an entire semesters worth.",

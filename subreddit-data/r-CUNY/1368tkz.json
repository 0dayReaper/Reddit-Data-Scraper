    "postText": "So I have my meeting to register for Macaulay classes in a few days\u2026 Is there any benefit to finding out which professors teach which classes etc and crossreferencing that with ratemyprofessor and stuff now or should I just wait a few days? Would any of that help or do they just put you on a predetermined path for freshman year according to your major? Do they give you the same freedom of choice in terms of which professor/section to choose that a non-freshman might have (where the rmp ratings might help)? \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with a few collegenow courses at my home campus so ik what a shitshow some classes can be lmao",

            "comment": "In my first semester, we were pretty much told to find what classes we needed for our general ed &amp; major on our own. The only courses you\u2019re predetermined to take are your freshman english class (at QC we took ENGL110H) and your honors seminar.\n\nFor now, I would start to look into classes you\u2019ll need for your degree (familiarize yourself with degreeworks) and then look into professors from there. Although, I didn\u2019t really have much of a choice because we registered fairly late and my classes of choice were full. \n\nObviously this may vary from campus to campus but this was just my experience",

They help you register for your classes but they don\u2019t pick what courses you take, as those are dependent on you and your major. Like I said, this may vary by campus but this was just my personal experience",

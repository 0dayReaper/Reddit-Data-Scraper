    "postText": "Hello everyone, I have a few concerns regarding to my application status for Fall 2023. I tried to reach out to the admission office a few times but the calls didn't go through.\n\nSo when I login my CUNYFirst account after I submitted, under the application information, it still says \"your application is incomplete. Review the section below if additional information is needed\" But I have already submitted all the transcripts and as well as emailed them to the admission office last month before the deadline. I received an email by the admission office saying it take 6-8 weeks to process the applications. Does that mean after the admission office received my applications and materials, they'll have to manually uploaded all info? Is there any further action still need to be taken from me?",

I heard another group of results come out on the 15 so keep an eye out. Make when u call it's nyc time and make sure to stay on the line because you will get answers and that's the best way because emails the forever.",

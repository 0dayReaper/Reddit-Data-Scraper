    "postText": "Hi I'm applying for cuny colleges this fall semester . I did GED and got 665 total. I am looking to do CIS ( computer information systems) as my major. I'm really worried about my essay I literally don't know what to write and I'm also bad at writing. I watched many videos on YouTube how to write college essays and those demotivated me more because the topics they say is something i can't even imagine. Is there any tips or suggestions you guys can give me that would help me a lot l.",

The topic can be about anything, write something you feel passionate about or something the college should know about you. Although I did pay like 20$ for grammarly due to my bad grammer\ud83d\ude2d.",

Their always putting stuff on us without telling us the benefit. They has a new dataset come out and decided that this was the solution.\n\nTf is wrong with these professors . . .

It\u2019s just trying to give people some guidance since not everyone is as wise and experienced as you are apparently.\n\nYou don\u2019t get any credit for it so just ignore it.",

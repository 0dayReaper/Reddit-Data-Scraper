    "postText": "I just had my in-person science lectures this week and honestly it\u2019s bad learning experience. Here are just few things that really annoy me. \n\n1. The professors wear masks during lectures and their voice is muffled. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to understand the \u201cmasked\u201d speech. Because of Covid safety policy, they have to keep the front door open, if the professors talk too loud through microphone, it\u2019s actually disruptive to the class next door. I have science classes, and basically there\u2019s no discussion or group work. I really don\u2019t see the point of being in-person. Recorded zoom lectures would be much better way to study because I can at least hear the professors clearly. \n\n2. Social distancing is a joke. Hallway is crowded. I don\u2019t see anyone cleaning the room in between classes. \n\n3. Library is not open in Brookdale campus. Where can students stay and study if they have 1-2 hours in between lectures? \n\nI am upset that CUNY change the plans during the summer and their decision seems to be irresponsible for students and faculties. CUNY is a commuter school. Lots of students spend long time on public transport to get to school for such bad learning environment but the school takes pride over the re-opening plan. The cases are rising, and we don\u2019t when booster shot will be available to the general public. Some students live with vulnerable family members and we risk to bring virus home. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen this winter.",

            "comment": "Students really need to make it clean to Department Chairs and admins above that level that they want more remote options. CUNY admins pushed chairs to have as many in person classes as possible, because this makes it seem a like the admins are accomplishing something. This means now that many core classes were only available in-person.\nAny Prof running an in person/hybrid section can also pretty easily run a online only section too, but the admins pushed against that hoping to get good PR.\n\nDepartments also don't have much to work with since students did a very bad job of organizing and letting them know what they wanted. Many assumed that \"everyone wants to be back in person even if it means struggling thru restrictions \". \nNext semester will be the same.",

Some courses barely fill 1 or 2 class rooms and if you start offering online options it really restricts options.\n\nThe other issue is many people choose the online option even though it is not suitable for them out of convenience. \n\nTo be honest, why even pay tuition if you are going to learn online anyway as it is just stupid. You can get all the resources you want on the internet right now for far less money or nothing. \n\nWhat you said is fair but by pushing these online courses will make the university/college experience worse in the long run. Now you can sit in your basement and ignore all the social benefits of having in person classes.",

However, most will not benefit from an online class and will not be engaged as an in person class.\n\nI can tell from experience that when I have an online class, I Just start browsing the web or doing other things while at my computer. I don't pay attention at all. With in-person classes I am much more engaged.\n\nI also don't have the luxury of talking about the class with other class mates.\n\nSo yes, most will choose the easiest option, but it is not the smart option in most cases. This is especially true with a community college as many of the people are probably borderline failing in most cases. \n\nI could be wrong here and this is really just my opinion. If you do some googling I think you can find that many students are behind because of remote learning, especially in grades before college.",

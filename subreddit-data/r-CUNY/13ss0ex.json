    "postText": "I was previously in a program for computer engineering and it just wasn\u2019t my cup of tea and looking for a new field to try. After doing some research I realized that cybersecurity seemed pretty intriguing and me being introverted in a way this seems perfect for myself. I\u2019m just looking for colleges that have this program near my area if anyone\u2019s knows of any good programs. Any help is good help.",

            "comment": "I think you should synch up with employers working in cyber-security and spend a day or week with them during the summer.\n\nThe career is lucrative but it may not be the best career for all those. It's eye-catchy because of the financial payout. \n\nIf I were to pick a school, I'd suggest [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/cybersecurity). I'd also suggest taking bootcamps, coding workshops, attending speaker series and also looking into online programs. \n\nThe degree from any college is not going to do it. You need the additional resources that are outside of the college world to really make you - the person - employable. \n\nWhich leads me to the last suggest: **internships**. City College have great resources. Take advantage of them if you're accepted. Good luck!",

That can help you figure out your next move. If I can also mention  a lot of people overlook tech in Healthcare. Look into EPIC. Go on their website and browse the jobs. They train you and your degree doesn't have to be in Tech",

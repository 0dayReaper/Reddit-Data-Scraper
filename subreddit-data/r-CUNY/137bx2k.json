            "comment": "Great question. I applied for readmission for fall to a school that admitted me last year (and I chose another school). My application is still being reviewed but I need a quicker answer so I talked to transfer admissions office yesterday and he said I can come down to the campus, apply for direct admission, and they\u2019ll tell me on the spot if I\u2019ve been admitted. I don\u2019t know your situation but maybe you can try the same? \n\nHope this helps",

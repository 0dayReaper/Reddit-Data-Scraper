    "postText": "As the title suggests, but for more information, I am a somewhat diligent student, who is graduating CIS at BMCC. I have interest in both security and networking. I already have my Network+ certification, and started studying for security+. I also plan on doing CCNA, and AWS cloud just because they interest me. My end goal is to work in City/State/Federal IT/Security jobs.\n\nI have yet to decide which college should I go to. With my interest in my mind, I have chosen the abovementioned two programs at those two colleges. What I want to know is which college should I choose that would give me the best resources for those jobs that I want (Government IT/Security jobs)?\n\nIf you also have any insights about these two colleges, please share.",

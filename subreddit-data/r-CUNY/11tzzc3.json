    "postText": "Hello. I'm an international student and I've applied to these CUNY colleges for the fall 2023 semester. LaGuardia, Kingsborough community college, City Tech, Medgar Evers college, CCNY and Brooklyn college. My application is now completed and being reviewed I just wanna know my chances of getting in. My credentials were evaluated and my gpa is 2.68/4\nWhich college out of the above do y'all think would accept my application with 2.68 gpa. P.S I applied Mathematics BS for all colleges",

I have some thoughts about how the program was run at times, but overall a great school, OP. I know you\u2019re aiming for a four-year school, but a start a LGA will save you money and set you up nicely for that if that\u2019s how it ends up going.",

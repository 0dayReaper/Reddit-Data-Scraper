TAP was supposed to cover it but I never received the money, I sent multiple emails and calls but nothing was done &amp; it\u2019s been almost 2 years. The last email they say I need to fix my DOB which is completely correct. I\u2019m going to try to pay out of pocket, but still want to do something about TAP",

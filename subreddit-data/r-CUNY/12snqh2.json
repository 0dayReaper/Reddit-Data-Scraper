I was thinking about withdrawing from the course but I'm scared that this will affect my financial aid because it will make me go from a full-time student to a part-time student.\n\nWill I have to pay anything back if I withdraw from this course while only having 12 credits",

That\u2019ll leave me with 10 credits at my current CUNY. \n\nI still haven\u2019t filed for fafsa and tap for 2023-2024 i\u2019m halfway complete. \n\nDo you think I would still have to pay back? \n\nPlease let me know, I would really like to drop the course. But I\u2019m worried. \n\nWould it be better if i complete fafsa &amp; tap and then drop or something?\n\nPlease let me know!!",

So, you definitely wouldn't have to pay anything back. \n\nSince you're transferring, that also means that dropping the class shouldn't have any impact on you because if you were to become ineligible for financial aid due to dropping that class, it would only apply at the college that you dropped the class at. Meaning, if you transfer to another college, you'll become eligible at that college. And there isn't anything special you have to do, you just automatically would become eligible again. \n\nAs for filling out FAFSA, it doesn't really make a difference whether you drop the class first and then fill out FAFSA, or fill out FAFSA first and then drop the class. You can do either of them. But, just make sure you drop the class by \n\nBut it's always best to speak to someone in the financial aid department because they'll be able to guide you and help you make the best decision for you.",

You will be fine for the next academic year as well.",

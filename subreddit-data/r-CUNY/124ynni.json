    "postText": "I have recently committed to HUNTER college and after admitted students day and touring the campus...I was sadly let down. The energy was very off from the beginning and I had hope of declaring computer science as a major but after meeting the represenatives at the expo/fair thing, it really left a bad taste in my mouth. The represenatives were not helpful with any of my questions and wasnt that inviting. I decided to look into psychology as a major and that was no different. Hearing reviews on here were definately validated after my visit.\n\nI got accepted to BMCC and I am more leaning towards going there instead. Campus and faculty seem more friendly and academic side seems more well rounded. Getting my associates sounds better at the momemnt especially being a transfer.\\\\\n\nAnyone have any thoughts of BCMM? or even HUNTER?",

You could get there easily, and Hunter is a pain in the ass when it comes to the 6 train.\n\nIt's in the heart of TriBeCa and by the west side highway.\n\nI never took any Computer Science classes, but the science department over there is good, a little old school but friendly.",

The only complaints I\u2019ve heard of BMCC is that the Murray Building has slow elevators and the usual \u201cNo one is social\u201d. We used Python in my CS class if that\u2019s what your wondering, hope this helps!",

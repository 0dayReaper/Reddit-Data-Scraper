I assumed they sent it because of Work-Study. \n\nI\u2019m a FT student. Taking 15 credits this semester. In good academic standing.",

You could be full time or part time ( recent addition) . But if those classes don\u2019t consist of ones that are applied to your major you won\u2019t get a TAP disbursement. It\u2019ll show up in your overall F/A package but won\u2019t be disbursed until you\u2019ve met the criteria needed to receive it.",

It shows under \u2018Estimated\u2019 same with last semesters. So for them to take it away, and say one has to wait\u2026 And I\u2019ve never taken out loans.\nI thought my Work-Study impacted it. I hope this gets resolved quickly.",

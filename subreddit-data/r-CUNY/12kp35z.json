            "comment": "I think there are other posts if you do a search on CUNY Nursing Programs. Someone asked  few days ago about BMCC. The CC Nursing programs take 3 years because you have to complete all your pre-req before being admitted into the program. You graduate with an Associates in Nursing when you're done. I've heard great things about BMCC and I know that they have an agreement with SPS to get your Bachelors. I would look through previous threads to see what students are saying and use that to make a decision. Look Especially for anything about getting kicked out of a program which I've seen at KCC.",

With that said, it comes down to commute, location, and any other factors you\u2019re looking for. Therefore, my suggestion would be York, CSI, or City Tech (to get a BSN with City Tech, you must get your Associates before moving onto their BSN track).",

I would say it\u2019s much more competitive compared to other CUNYs offering Nursing. Only 100 students get accepted, and you need to maintain a 3.2+ GPA, and have to get a B or higher in your math and science courses - preferably in all your courses. On top of that, all CUNYs require an entrance exam for nursing - either PAX RN (Hunter), TEAS, or HESI.",

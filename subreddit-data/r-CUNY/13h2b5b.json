    "postText": "This question of CUNY shutting down because they have no money has been in the talks for a while. While most people who say that they will shut down don\u2019t mean soon, it\u2019s implied in the near future they will because of their financial situation. Do you think theirs any truth to this? Or just a running joke in the community, or both?",

            "comment": "Lol, yes CUNY has budget issues but so does every college/UNI out there. CUNY\u2019 budget is like $4B per year. The cuts will lead to reduction in classes; the cuts have happened during the entire Cuomo administration. This is nothing new. Some facts- CUNY is the largest urban university in the county with a student population of 250,000. Its contribution to NY state economy is unmatched. Shutting down CUNY is like shutting down the subway. Also some of the CUNYs have existed for a long time. CCNY is 175 years old, the first free college anywhere in the US.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re referring to recent budget cuts imposed by the bald-headed brown egg holding the mayoral position in our city, I believe those budget cuts primarily affect community colleges. 4-year-unis rely on funding from the city but also have external funding, so they\u2019re not going anywhere anytime soon. Community colleges more than likely won\u2019t disappear either but they\u2019re gonna fall on some seriously hard times if that budget plan doesn\u2019t get revised.

I\u2019m not even from the city and I have a full time job and it\u2019s tax season. No time to go out to the city for a 15 minute test. \nDoes anyone know where I can contact if this impacts my ability to enter the buildings.",

So they let me slide that one day but right after class I had to get the test done. Make sure to get it done soon the covid testing lines are INSANE. they literally tend to stretch around the whole block.",

Luckily, class is mostly virtual this semester, so hopefully don't have to get into a building until after they stop requiring this.",

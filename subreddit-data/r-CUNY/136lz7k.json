    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nJoin the CUNY to improve food procurement in New York State with a few quick calls and by advocating on social media to ensure the Good Food NY Bill moves forward this session. Calls make a big difference in terms of what legislators are tracking for their priorities. The elected officials on this shortlist each have a key role in moving it across the finish line in the weeks ahead. \n\n[Support Good Food NY](https://act.newmode.net/action/new-york-state-good-food-purchasing-program-coalition/make-calls-send-tweet-support-good-food)\n\nCheck Out [CUNY Urban Food Policy](https://cunyurbanfoodpolicy.org/)",

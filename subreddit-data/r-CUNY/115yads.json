Having an associates degree will definitely improve your chances significantly of being accepted in to John Jay. You should also take the time to check BMCC's Articulation Agreement section on their website to see what majors and institutes allow credits to be transferred over to one another. (For me, an articulation agreement exists for Computer Science between John Jay and BMCC to allow all my credits to be transferred over)\n\nhttps://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/academics/advisement/transfer-information/articulation-agreements/",

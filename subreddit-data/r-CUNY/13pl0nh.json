While you got probably used to just download the pdf version of the book, there will be classes where you\u2019ll be forced to purchase access to a website. (Which is kind of a form of an ebook).\n\nAlso if you\u2019ve any lab classes, you\u2019ll be expected to purchase lab kits\u2026",

I'm sure the professors view it in a matter of \"you were going to spend money on textbooks anyway\" even though most of us use rentals or straight up don't buy the textbook. Sucks but what can ya do? I had to finance mine with klarna last year \ud83d\udc80",

            "comment": "They do that to guarantee that each student pays for the whole thing. Because if it was a PDF, it would be just one person finds it and shares it or one student buys it and people would zelle him or apple pay him their part of the cost. The requirement for the book or the access is coming straight from the department and it is a business. Companies make deals with colleges in order to specifically use their book. I have had several professors that have tried to dodge that knowing how broke and miserable a lot of CUNY students are and they remember how bad it was for them also so they let the class know, \"that is the book and you do not need to waste money and get it, I got you with everything that you need. I have to put it on the syllabus but you do not need to buy it.\" A lot of Satanists would then go on to report the professor to the Department and then the department would get rid of them. I am speculating that this has happened recently with a professor of mine. Excellent guy, an elite person in New York who teaches from his heart with good intentions for his students and is always trying to land them an internship. Bros and gals, we got to have big people like this dude called Steven C. Beer, he is a big shot media lawyer who worked with Lady Gaga, Beyonce and some other big names. Dude was only there cause he owed a favor to my professor, who is a retired wild lawyer of New York. And guess what? the department got rid of the professor and said nothing to him. The ugly truth is, College is a business and whoever tells you that they work for you is a fucking idiot. They do whatever they want especially because they are considered a City employee. Their money comes from Albany, their jobs are Union protected and they are not going to bow down by just a couple of complaints. Only if there is demonstration of a business deal on the media then maybe they would back down. But anyways, Sometimes you just gotta take the L bro, but I assure you in most classes, there will always be professors who mention a book who you can share the cost with your classmates or you can share the PDF. Best of luck.",

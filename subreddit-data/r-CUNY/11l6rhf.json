    "postText": "I heard back from Queensborough Community College (and the class selection doesn't look great for summer computer science) so I was wondering if some of the 4 year schools like Queens and Brooklyn College would let me know if I got into the fall semester before summer so I can sign up for summer classes. I know the expected turnaround is 6-8 weeks but I was wondering if its sometimes less if they like your application. Let me know! The classes for Queensborough look kind of limited for the summer so I was hoping to get into Queens or Brooklyn College so I can take a C++ course like **CSCI\u00a0211\u00a0at Queens.** ",

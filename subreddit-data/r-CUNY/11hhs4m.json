    "postText": "So I really need some help and advice here. I\u2019m a 2x drop out from CSI, I started back in 2013 with a Social work major. Ended up going into academic probation due to some stuff I had going on and I dropped out in 2015 after getting my gpa back up to a 2.4.. I re-enrolled in 2018 and changed my major to Business Management took some classes and dropped out again in 2019. So I currently have a 2.6 gpa and 64 credits all in all. \n\nI should say I never wanted to do B.M. I just majored in it because I thought it\u2019ll be the easiest degree for me to obtain given my academic record. I really want to go back into school and transfer to another Cuny, this time for Nursing. I really want to do nursing or something in the medical field. I\u2019ve always wanted to work with children. I still need to take pre-reqs for most of the science classes being that I\u2019ve never taken them. I guess what I\u2019m asking is will it be hard to get into a nursing program with my academic past so far? I know the programs are extremely competitive but I figured if I work hard enough I think the highest my gpa may go up is to a 3.2 maybe. Is that to low to get into a nursing program? I should also mention I have to retake Psych because I got a D back in 2013. Will they let me retake it and accept the new grade I get? I was considering York being that they have a generic B.s program for nursing but I don\u2019t mind doing associates either somewhere else.",

Do you know how lenient they are when it comes to pre-req retakes? I need to redo that D and if I do will they go with the new grade? I looked into LPN briefly but being that I already have college credits I wanted to pursue just finishing a degree. LPN would be plan B for me if I have difficulty getting into a program in the future.",

Extremely competitive program and a retake, if it affects your GPA, will drastically increase your chance of getting in. I think there\u2019s certain situations where a retake will actually prevent you from getting in in general.",

            "comment": "For BMCC, the program looks at both your HESI exam (50%) and prereq GPA (50%). They rank the applicants based on that resulting number. You\u2019d probably think you have a chance if 1. your HESI is good and GPA is great, 2. your HESI is great and GPA is good, or 3. your HESI and GPA are both great. But scenario #2 is not accepted.\n\nYou basically have to have all As for the prereq classes. If your prereq GPA is high enough then the academic advisor for nursing (there\u2019s only one person: Yvonne, and everyone hates her) will allow you to take the HESI at BMCC, they only accept HESI taken at BMCC. The minimum prereq GPA changes each semester depending on competition, last time she told me it was about 3.65+, when I asked people around last semester it went up to 3.7+. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t think your prereq GPA is high enough she wont let you take the HESI. But you need the HESI to apply to the program, so you\u2019re basically eliminated. I know someone who had a 4.0 prereq GPA and got around 83-85%?? on the HESI, they did not get in. I know someone who got 92%+?? on HESI and I\u2019m assuming around 4.0 GPA, and they got in. Good luck!!",

                    "comment": "100% FACTS! Yes, u perfectly said everything. I was about to apply for the program and I only have 3.2 GPA some A's and Bs and Yvonne won't let me take HESI. So, I transferred to another school. She gave me advised to retake all the courses that I didn't get A's. And I think that is nonsense if ever, because I was thinking lets say I retake all the courses that I didn't get A's then I didn't reach the required points in HESI so it doesn't make sense at all. It's like your wasting money and time. Also, I was thinking  they should change their curriculum that said at least u hv 2.75 min gpa  and u can go with nursing. They are fooling students to be honest. One more thing, there was a lady and she is Filipina and I think she is one of the lead advisor in nursing, I emailed her if he can help me and she was so unkind. She told me you cannot be a nurse because you didn't reach the required gpa go look for another school. I was like disappointed because I am a Filipina who was asking her if there's any way she could help me. I know some or most  filipinos are very helpful in this kinda situation but not her. She cannot even speak fluently  gosh. Her name is Josephine just search her and she has very low reviews.",

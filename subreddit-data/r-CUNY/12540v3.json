If you filled out the fasfa and your efc is 3,000 or less you\u2019re eligible to get it waived also. You don\u2019t have to start in the summer but the option is there if you want. If you plan on starting in the fall then that\u2019s fine as well. Being admitted for summer doesn\u2019t change anything except taking a summer class before the regular semester if you want.",

You can go on the CUNY website to see examples for prep. There will be vocabulary and a short essay. I know CUNY had issues with COVID Kids so if there are any changes you will see it in the prep.",

You have to be proficient in English and know the basics. There are people that don't know how to structure paragraphs, use citations or even use proper punctuation. I'm not saying that's you but that's what the test is for.",

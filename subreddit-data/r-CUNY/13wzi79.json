Or if anyone can tell me if city college offer any ethic , genetic or general nutrition class during the summer?",

Definitely reach out to admissions at one of the two schools as soon as you can. Since you\u2019re no longer an active CUNY student (since you graduated), you need to be re-admitted. The process can take weeks, depending on how fast they work or how many other students need to be processed. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you can epermit as a Non-Degree student, you\u2019ll have to inquire about that as well if you want to take courses from multiple schools.",

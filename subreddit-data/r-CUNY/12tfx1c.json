I would suggest that consider officially withdrawing from your courses, or even consider taking a leave of absence for a semester if you just need some time away to take care of something. \n\nWith a GPA less than 2.0, you won't be able to enroll in a Bahelors program, so if you are already in a bachelor's program, it would be better to stay in. If you leave, you won't be able to come back until you raise your GPA.\n\nNone of this advice will be your exact answer, but you can probably get good advice by talking to an academic adviser in your department who knows your situation and can give more specific recommendations.",

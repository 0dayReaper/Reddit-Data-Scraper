    "postText": "Even until this day out of 5 of my classes I'm still missing a grade on cunyfirst. The professor was all over the place, ignored our emails, always use the \"technical issues\" card, and graded things last minute.\n\nThe thing is the final grades are already on blackboard, but after 2 days of uploading it to blackboard it still hasn't appeared on my cunyfirst course record. The professor said she already submitted the grades on cunyfirst and I wonder does it really takes days to show up? I thought once they submitted it automatically shows.",

My professor uploaded our grades at the very last minute Friday and they didn't show up until yesterday. Unless yours submitted them after the deadline there's no reason they shouldn't be there",

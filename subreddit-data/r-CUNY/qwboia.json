Like how this vaccine is minimally effective in protecting against the delta variant (the main cause of new infections now), but somehow the solution is to make sure every last person is vaccinated? We're demonized for questioning the vaccine or any of the draconian measures taken in New York that haven't actually brought us any closer to getting over this virus. \n\n Finding something wrong with how the government is managing this situation doesn't make you a conspiracy theorist or someone who doesn't care about public safety - it just means you'd like to have some sort of open conversation about the pros and cons of what we're doing and that maybe you understand history. \n\nWe are not any closer to ending the pandemic.

My guess is that we will be required to get boosters regularly to be considered fully vaccinated going forward, even if it is just more of the same minimally effective vaccine.\n\nThe mask requirements are not going to end any time soon.\n\nWe actually do not have any plan going forward it seems for being post-COVID, within CUNY and worldwide. The delta variant doesn't care if you're vaccinated. I assume that we will have booster requirements in our future for a shot that still doesn't solve the problem with the new variants that are to come.\n\nNothing makes sense about the handling of this.

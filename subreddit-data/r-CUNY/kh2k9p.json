    "postText": "This semester really got me so exhausted. I don\u2019t know about you guys but I hope classes go back to being in person soon. All of the all-nighters I pulled this semester is really catching up to me now and I\u2019m feeling so drained. Got more than 10 hours of sleep every night since my last final and I\u2019m still feeling so drained. When classes were in person, it felt like I had no homework and all I had to do was study. During this online semester, it felt like I had a test every other week and homework due every day. Even though I tried to catch up and stay on top of every assignment, it felt like more and more assignments were being thrown at me. A month break is not long enough..",

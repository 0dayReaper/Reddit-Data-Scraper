And neither are the remedial Summer courses. Is it because CUNY recently said that they would eliminate their remedial courses? (But they still how up as pre-requisites on CUNYfirst) \n\nI haven\u2019t talked to my Advisor yet, but I am concerned. If you had remedial needs, what is CUNY doing for you? (And will it cost extra?)",

            "comment": "Idk how QCC does it, but my school got rid of remedial classes. I took them before they removed them. They took it out at my school, but they replaced it with a normal math class that you get credit for it. Its hard because it's grade 1-12 and it tests you on arithmetic.\n\nI would encourage you to start taking classes and go to tutoring everyday for your first semester. The most common issue I see is people are good at algebra and some of the more advance math, but they forgot some of the basics, but they usually pick it back up quickly. \n\nIn pre-calculus  they didn't test me on arithmetic and it was easier than the remedial math because it was using the same basic numbers when doing the algebra. You have to mesmerise the formulas which was, but as long as you know what to do you are good. \n\nAgain the only reason I think people struggle with the lower level math classes is because its grades 1-12 and it tests you on more than one subject not just one subject like pre-calculus. Don't let the math stop from going for it.",

    "postText": "I am currently a student at LaGuardia CC majoring in New Media Technology and will be transferring to a four-year university next semester. I got accepted to both Barcuh( Business Communiaction-Graphic Communication) (BA), City College ( ELECTRONIC DESIGN AND MULTIMEDIA) (BFA), and now I am kinda struggling between those two. tbh I love web design and graphic design so City College also has been my priority. On the other hand, Baurch's (Graphic Communication) major is half business and design which I also can learn about business at the same time plus a higher ranking, So I am thinking that even if I can't find a job in the design field after I graduate I still have a business back up. However, I don't have experience in taking business classes plus I didn't take any business classes at LaGuardia CC therefore now I am kinda struggling to choose when college",

If you decide to double major ( Business Administration and Management) that I\u2019m not sure about you may have to stay extra. It seems like CCNY seems to be your priority but you would appreciate the business aspect incorporated into your degree that Baruch can offer. Obviously the choice is up to you. Baruch is also a good school so I think either choice you make will be fine. As far as not taking business classes so far I don\u2019t  think that matters I can give you my example I have an associates from BMCC in video arts technology but fell in love with politics and am double majoring in poli-sci and international studies at ccny with no prior class experience except for one intro poli sci elective I took in BMCC that sparked my interest. I  only have to  stay  an extra semester because of it.",

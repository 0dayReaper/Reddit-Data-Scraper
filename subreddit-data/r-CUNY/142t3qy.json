    "postText": "So I recently got an email sent about my revised financial aid offer and it doesn't show the Spring term for some reason and for the Fall term it shows that I am not receiving the PELL Grant and TAP is way lower also for some reason. This is going to be my 5th year since I changed my major. Should I be worried? Does anyone know why this is? I emailed the financial aid office of my college but haven't gotten a reply.",

Am I suppose to do something to show that I\u2019m doing Spring also? I probably will graduate in my 6th year. This is giving me so much anxiety \ud83d\ude2d",

You write a ~500 word reconsideration, why you feel they should reconsider and why X school is right for you, add updated letters of recommendations and any other things that count (for example I won a prize at my community college). Took me about 3 weeks to hear back, and to be fair I did have an incredible counselor that advocated for me as well. You\u2019re gonna want to reach out to admissions at the schools that denied you.",

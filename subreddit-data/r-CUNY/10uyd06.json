Would it be manageable or should I drop one of them? I won\u2019t be working so college would be my top priority, but I\u2019m nervous about the workload. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",

I don\u2019t know your schedule but if you have work or other things you wish to do this summer I recommend you only take one.  I also recommend you also check rate my professor to know what kind of teachers you should get ready to face.",

BUT if you don\u2019t have to o work and you\u2019re okay with sacrificing one summer then definitely it\u2019s doable! Just treat studying and homework as a full time job and you definitely can do it :)",

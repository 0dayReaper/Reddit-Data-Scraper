    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nSo I recently applied to BMCC as a transfer from CSI. I currently have a hold on my CUNYFirst, but I still went on to apply. Will my application be denied if they see my Hold? Also, is there anyway to update to application like adding additional family members. And, is it possible to apply again if I do get denied, but this time with the hold cleared? Sorry if I\u2019m sounding a bit convoluted.",

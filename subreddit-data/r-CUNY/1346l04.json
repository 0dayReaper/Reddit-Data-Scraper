    "postText": "Hi all!\nI need some help. I am a transfer student. \nI applied to both SPS and Medgar on the 17th of April. I got an admissions letter from SPS on the 24th but have not accepted it yet. I received many emails from SPS welcoming me to their school and asking me to book an appointment with their academic planner. As much as I would love to hit accept to SPS since I hear it is a really good college I have to wait for Medgar because of my scholarship. I have a scholarship that has a partnership with Medgar and not SPS so my hands are a bit tied. On one of the emails from SPS they outlined some important dates and one of them that is making me stress is I have to book an appointment with the academic planner within 10 days of admission. If I understand that correctly it means I have until May 4th to accept and book an appointment. \n\nWhat should I do? I don\u2019t want to miss my chance with SPS but I also don\u2019t want to lose the chance of going to Medgar without worrying about tuition. Any advice?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

But, I don't recall needing to email my advisor so soon after being admitted for Fall.",

I can see that they really are a good school but unfortunately I would need to pay out of pocket if I go there. My scholarship doesn\u2019t cover their tuition and paying out of pocket means digging into my savings \ud83d\ude22",

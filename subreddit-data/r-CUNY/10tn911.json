Let\u2019s say (making up numbers) you need 150 credits to graduate, and 85 are required to be credits for your major, the rest of those credits (65) can be fulfilled through elective classes. Not every elective credit will also be considered credits for your major, and for me typically none of them do. So in short, not really.",

What I\u2019m essentially asking is I\u2019m taking this one class that\u2019s under the \u201celectives allowed section\u201d - I\u2019m trying to make sure it\u2019s not for no reason.",

There's a section for not allowed which if you're a transfer student shows the credits not applied to your degree because you have to take a certain number of credits in-house and you may have taken classes not applicable to your degree. If you aren't a transfer student this shouldn't be a concern as you wouldn't be taking classes outside of your degree tract.",

Degree Works should be a way to keep track of your progression and not if you're taking the correct classes. That can be a costly mistake especially if you receive financial aid.",

            "comment": "Curriculum requirements are in three parts: general education (at CUNY that is the Pathways Common Core, consisting of the required and flexible core, as well as the College Option for bachelor's-degree students), major, and electives. You need to take courses for all three. The last one--electives--gets you to the total number of credits needed for your degree (usually 120 for a bachelor's and 60 for an associate's degree). Usually the number of credits required for general education plus those required for the major will not add to the total needed for the degree, so electives fill up the rest. If Degree Works is showing you credits as \"electives allowed\" that means those credits are counting in the third part. If it shows you credits as \"electives not allowed\" those are what we call excess credits--credits that do not satisfy any degree requirements and that are in excess of what are needed for your degree. Many students accumulate excess credits, and that may be on purpose but it it also means they spent time and money they didn't need to spend in order to get their degree. Hope this helps.",

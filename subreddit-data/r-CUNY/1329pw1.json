    "postText": "Hi , so I\u2019m a student at Baruch college and my major is biology. I was looking at other CUNY schools that offer organic chemistry 1 during the summer. So I can avoid taking it in the fall. It seems my best option is at John jay. But I don\u2019t know anything about the school, or their professors or their classes. \nSo for org chem 1 summer 23 the professor for lecture and rec is Guoqui Zhang and the lab professors are Vishal Persaud and Elaan Lukasiewicz. \nCan anyone that studies or studied at john jay let me know if it\u2019s worth taking org Chem 1 in the summer??\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dim trying to avoid taking too many of my remaining science classes together. \nThank you!",

    "postText": "I graduated from Brooklyn college last year with a degree in international business. I am trying to peruse a career in finance. It\u2019s been almost a year now applying and I haven\u2019t had any luck. I seem to be getting rejected because of lack of experience. I even tried lowering my standards and just applying for any office job to get my foot in the door and I still have no luck! I feel like it\u2019s challenging to network. I don\u2019t have any family or friends that\u2019s work in corporate jobs and BC alumni services I find also aren\u2019t the most helpful. Has anyone experienced a similar situation coming from a CUNY school or have any advice for me? Please tell me it gets better \ud83d\ude05",

I graduated in CS at Lehman and now doing a Master's at City -- it's tough. Unfortunately, we came from schools that recruiters had never heard about or not regarded as high, so in this economic downturn, students of private colleges are prioritized. Trust me, I know a recruiter from Meta that hires specifically from NYU and Princeton.. the company is still hiring, but you have yet to hear about it as the job posts are not on their websites.",

If not, there's a 0% chance your resume will be noticed coming from a CUNY that's not Baruch. Really quick tips for anyone reading. To be noticed in finance (which I was): you need (1) brand name school, (2) brand name work experience, and/or (3) someone referring you in \n\nI was #2 and #3 because I went to CCNY but I worked my ass off meeting people. I met over 10,000 people in my time at CCNY. I met people everywhere I could get my foot into, whether it's other universities, formal professional events, etc. I stole the internship and job opportunities from a bunch of Harvard students when it came time for interviews\n\nFor you right now esp since you've graduated, try to just get a job first and/or a finance job that's not in a big name company. Several ways to do this:\n\n1. Research BC alums who are working at an ideal company and reach out. Google how to reach out. A lot of templates. Someone will respond, I guarantee you\n2. Reach out to hiring managers at companies. You MUST always mention what you bring to the table and back that up, whether through past experiences or even projects. Always say you're passionate about something even if you're not. Your career prospects are #1. You must get your foot through the first door. Be results oriented. Do not bring up your worries, weaknesses, etc \n3. Look into fellowships for graduates. I heard there are COOPS that are like training programs that'll eventually refer you into jobs\n4. Cold call. Cold call like hell. Whether you get a job at a small business, nonprofit, or somewhere, it's all a good first step. The moment you get the first door opened, everything else is easier \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don't always gotta do finance. There are tons of amazing opportunities under different job titles which could eventually lead you into finance if that's what you want",

Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working at an Amazon warehouse packing boxes for orders, that\u2019s good experience too. Frame it well - focus on results &amp; pick out skills that fit the opportunity you\u2019re going for \n\nOnly quit the job when you have found a paid internship. You can have internships fall, spring, summer and even winter. It\u2019s a constant grind, no joke. You\u2019re basically opportunity hunting all year long. there is no break \n\nBaruch has the best career prospects out of all the CUNYs. Your alumni network is insane. I was at CCNY but I 100% networked with Baruch alum. Just within my fellowship where we had students from almost all CUNYs, my peers at Baruch came out at JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, Goldman, Accenture. In terms of non-finance, I saw Baruch peers come out as Forbes 30 Under 30 for entrepreneurship. Look for alums and start introducing yourself. Keep in touch. Baruch clubs are amazing too \n\nBaruch professors are THE gold standard of all CUNYs. If you research the professors there, they\u2019re actually really well accomplished. Nothing like CCNY where professors are academia-based with 0 relevant experience in the real world but trying to teach us about the real world\n\nIf I were you, make time to take advantage of opportunities. College is the best time to get opportunities. I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s way harder when you\u2019re out of college. You don\u2019t regularly get 24/7 access to professors, campus resources, staff, external resources for college students, etc when you\u2019re out of school",

Go full-time into writing with funding (got the opportunity and the sponsor to do the book)\n3. Take a leap of faith &amp; a law firm's sponsorship to do whatever I wanted\n\nDid #3 and built a multimillion dollar business in 1 year. It felt freaking amazing to tell the law firm that I took his small investment to build a multimillion dollar business in less than 1 year. I came from poverty and lived through many many years of having $0 in the bank like many other students. I never thought I'd see a million dollars in my lifetime. Saw it before I even got close to hitting 30 yo \n\nCurrently on my way to diversifying my pursuits even more. Looking to take on even bigger projects at big tech or PR. Ofc, grow and automate the business as well",

            "comment": "Hi, also a Brooklyn college student and I'm not majoring in international business but in finance. I feel you man, there are not a lot of resources for finance students in this college. That being said, if you are a first gen student, meaning that your parents never went to college in America, I suggest you apply for the Basta fellowship. They partner with a lot of companies in the financial sector and they can help you with your job search, meaning they can help your with your resume, interviewing skills, networking, etc. However, on their website,  I see that one way you're eligible is you had to have graduated within 3 months to be on the program. You could email them and see if you might be eligible and apply for it. Anyway, here is the link. Wish you all the luck, man. https://www.projectbasta.com",

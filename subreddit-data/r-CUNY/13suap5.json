I took four summer courses, just got a email today that summer session 1 payment is due on the 29th of this month. Before back in BMCC I didn\u2019t pay for summer classes until it was time to select classes for the Spring semester. Same with he winter courses. Didn\u2019t have to pay till it was time to select classes for the Fall semester. What do I do??",

    "postText": "Hello hooligans, just a reminder that if you feel like dropping a class and you already spoke to your advisor about it to confirm it then JUST DROP IT.\n\nDon\u2019t be a stupid person like me who waited until the last week to drop to find out that I can\u2019t anymore. Now my transcript filled of A\u2019s will have one F dragging everything down.\n\nLearn from my mistake and don\u2019t be so clumsy like me. Keep up with your deadlines and don\u2019t fall back.\n\nWorst part about is that I had to drop it because it wasn\u2019t part of my required courses to graduate due to a major switch. Now I\u2019m forced to retake the class potentially in the future if I want to remove the stain.\n\nBest case scenario, I graduate with all A\u2019s and one F and just use this situation to brag about it. Who knows.",

I get in to a point that the desinformaron about what and how my credits will transfers got me anxiety attacks. All the advisors that I consult did not anything about the process, they just read the web page of the college and that is all. \n\nPlease, somebody knows or have experience with transferring from BMCC to Baruch to get a major in finance.\n\nDid you have problem with the credits? Like having to take too much courses because the courses that you took did not count towards the degree in Baruch?",

            "comment": "do you know about degreeworks? you should be able to see what will transfer there when you run a \"transfer what if\". if you've already been accepted at Baruch you can also reach out to an advisor there to see what will and won't transfer. you might have to do that regardless. i'm in accounting, not finance, but i also got accepted at baruch but ended up going to john jay, and there were 3 classes that should have transferred 1 to 1 but JJ turned them into electives. an advisor was able to override 1 of the classes but the other 2 remained electives. good luck with everything EDIT: here's a link to baruch's transfer department https://enrollmentmanagement.baruch.cuny.edu/undergraduate-admissions/transferstudents/",

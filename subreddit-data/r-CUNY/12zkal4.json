After meeting people who go to Columbia for like $1k with scholarships/financial aid, I'm starting to question if CUNY is even right for me. a cs degree from Hunter College is not as well respected as other colleges. I'm thinking about stony brook, smith college, Syracuse and Columbia. any recommendations ? or should I just stay here at finish this degree :/",

Any CUNY name by itself will not do much to open doors, then again, some of these universities you listed are on another level so getting into them is no easy feat especially Columbia. I would caution against switching if you care about having every class and credit transfer to a new school seamlessly. If you can switch schools and not spend too much more money on your degree I would recommend it. SBU has a really good CS program for the money.\n\nThis is my perspective coming from someone who went to CUNYs and other universities that are not CUNY. The most of the CS professors at Hunter are complete dogshit at teaching and don't give two fucks about anything (becomes more apparent in upper level CS courses as people only care to put in enough effort to pass). Not saying that other colleges are guarantee at teaching CS well and you won't need to self study, but at Hunter there is a lack of help available and overall just an atmosphere of apathetic people with pent up grievances from both instructors and students. The common student at CUNY will not care enough to put in 100% and neither do instructors. CUNY administration across all schools are something to be shamed; admin is slow and completely filled with people who do not care to move an inch to help students. If you're going to go through with staying at Hunter, prepared to work your ass off to get your foot in the door in industry and to do well in your coursework.",

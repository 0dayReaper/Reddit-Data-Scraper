    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm considering transferring from the University of Connecticut (currently working on a BS Computer Science) to one of the CUNYs (CCNY has a quality program from my understanding), for a variety of reasons. As a start, I have a family which is narcissistic and queerphobic, and it's not a situation that I think I can maintain for the next three years of my education. Also, there is a significant chance that I have epilepsy, so being able to drive in the future is shaky at best. Lastly, UConn is quite expensive, and I'm not sure how I can reasonably pay for the next three years of my education. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all of this in mind, I suppose my main questions are:\n\n* What is the difference in the quality of a Computer Science degree from one of the CUNYs versus UConn?\n* Is this a feasible thing to try to achieve as a young trans woman with only her friends for help?\n* How does obtaining financial aid in the CUNY system work? Do I have to live in NYC for a year before getting the residential rate?\n* Are there any other schools I should consider throwing a transfer application to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help or advice, and apologies for the long-winded post.",

They are both public universities meant for their own residents and I haven't heard anything about either. I go to CUNY College of Staten Island for Computer Science which is also considered dirt-cheap. Most people I know only go here for the cheap in-state rate, but you have to live in Staten Island which is the con, with little public transportation.\n&gt; Is this a feasible thing to try to achieve as a young trans woman with only her friends for help?\n\nNYC is incredibly LGBT friendly, with the exception of maybe Staten Island but even then it's mostly suburban folks there and you'd have little reason to go there. They won't make your life harder but maybe just stare at you at max. You will have **little reason to go to Staten Island.** NYC is definitely a place you would thrive in, I have lots of queer friends and they don't get discriminated in the city.\n&gt;How does obtaining financial aid in the CUNY system work? Do I have to live in NYC for a year before getting the residential rate?\n\nIf you are coming: I am assuming that like many others, you plan to live in Manhattan with your friends, but you'd have to balance working for your rent and paying tuition off. At least for that one year while you try to gain in residence. [You just stay in for one year for a senior college](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/university-tuition-fee-manual/iv-residency/) (like CCNY) before classes start in NYC. Try to live in Queens or Bronx if possible, since they're closer to CCNY but you would have to commute and its cheaper rent. I would HIGHLY recommend going to BMCC first as they have articulation agreements with the colleges in CUNY. They have a dirt-cheap tuition for in state residents. But if you do go this route and then go to CCNY, you will have to retake Calculus since CCNY is so much more difficult and the flagship of Engineering of the other CUNYs.\n\n&gt;Are there any other schools I should consider throwing a transfer application to?\n\nIF you get a fee waiver, just throw it out at any CUNY you can. Something like Queens, Brooklyn, BMCC, KBCC, Hunter, and Baruch College. I think you could get into Baruch's new CS program too, while it isn't established yet, it has a lot of business students which is undoubtedly great for connections and their Math Department is particularly strong, to the point where it is one of the only CUNYs next to Hunter to have an agreement to transfer their Calculus courses over to CCNY. Hunter is also a great choice, while they offer a B.A, they are still respected as a strong CS contender in CUNY. \n\nBest of luck, I hope you arrive in NYC. Once you stay here, you'll never want to go home",

I'm already taking Calculus 2 at UConn, a comparable institution to Rutgers I suppose, so I'd think that the credit will transfer smoothly. That should mean I would just have to worry about MVC/Diff Eq. and Linear Algebra if plans of study are comparable between institutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm okay with taking out loans to get my degree, I just want to avoid taking out $80k of loans as I would currently have to do at UConn.",

I would recommend taking Differential Equations last if possible if you are dead set on transferring since all CUNYs require Linear Algebra and the majority require Multivariable Calculus for their CS degrees, but not all require Diff Eq. Also, save all your syllabuses and coursework if possible.",

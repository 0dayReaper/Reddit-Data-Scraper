You need to show proof of residence from June 12th, 2022 till now. \n\nYou also need to fill out an in state residence form. Each school has their own form. Here's one from CCNY:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/CUNY%2520residency%2520form_022316.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJtbfYrun-AhUEhYkEHahaDI0QFnoECCEQBQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1OuUpCDXXNsp3NTlIDPMqi\n\nEven if you don't go to CCNY you can get an idea of what documents they want to provide your residency. \n\nGood luck!",

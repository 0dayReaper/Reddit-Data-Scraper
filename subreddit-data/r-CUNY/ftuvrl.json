I can't understand this given the world pandemic and the option to delet any grade you don't like at the end of the semester. If you don't want to do the work, then just don't do it. Why waste my already pressed time sending me out chasing after the lame cheating sources you've used. BTW we've all relaxed our grading standards. So, if you turn in your own lame work you'll get a higher grade than you deserve. However, if you cheat, well, it's not as if dishonesty is any less dishonest because of a pandemic. So, if you don't want to learn, given that we're all likely to suffer mass casualties, watch Netflix and spare your professor the cheating.",

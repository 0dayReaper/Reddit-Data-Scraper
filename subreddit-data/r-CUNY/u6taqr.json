With the new update, I like the modern feel, but it's very messy.\n\nEdit: When registering for classes, the column for professors will only show if their name is listed. So if the professor's name is not listed, in the global search, it'll show as TBA and on cunyfirst it just won't have the instructor column.",

No Millennial or Gen Z would cosign this stupid shit. I looked up to see who is the head of CUNY, his name is F\u00e9lix V. Matos Rodr\u00edguez, a 60-year-old boomer. I assume he is trying to be hip by cosigning the new look. Fool!",

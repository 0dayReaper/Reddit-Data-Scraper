    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am currently about to enter my sophomore year at Brooklyn College. However, I was curious about the radiology tech program at City Tech. How difficult is it, is the transfer process between CUNY\u2019s simple, and is City Tech  fun/nice? Because so far I really like Brooklyn College but I\u2019m weighing my options.",

In my experience so far it\u2019s not hard at all if you actually study and do your independent study. I\u2019m forever on YouTube watching mock imaging exams and techniques to stay ahead of the instruction learned in class.",

I hear there\u2019s an overwhelming flow of RT majors lately at least at Hostos which is why I have to wait an entire year. To begin the next portion of the curriculum. There are a handful of courses where you can\u2019t get a grade below a B and if you do you\u2019ll have to write the department and explain why and then they\u2019ll still have to decide if you can attempt again. But like I said .. it\u2019s not hard at all if it\u2019s something you\u2019re really interested in. What are studying at BC?",

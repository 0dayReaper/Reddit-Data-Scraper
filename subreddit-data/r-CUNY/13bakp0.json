Your best bet is to try and figure out when spring 24 semester starts because spring break is ideally the halfway mark, but again it may be off by a week either before or after",

Also Kingsborough does 12 weeks whereas I believe a fair amount of the others do 16 weeks, like SPS, which may be why Spring break comes in at 2/3rds of the way for your school since it starts earlier.",

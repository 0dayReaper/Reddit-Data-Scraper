To paraphrase\n \u201cThis is a threat, He loves to threaten to cut funding when we wouldn\u2019t open the economy, nothing happened , he\u2019s threatening if we don\u2019t reopen in the fall, he\u2019ll cut funding. Where\u2019s this funding that we get in the first place? We do not get funding, NY funds ourselves when it comes to our most expensive projects. NY does not respond to threats , bullying will not work \u201c",

If the first wave fails, I start plans for a second wave', etc. Infections increase so long as there are infectables. \"waves\" only exist because you are able to do things like lockdowns or have high usage of masks and other precautions and thus are able to control the infection rate, until you decide to stop.\nNY hasn't fully opened up. That's what infections aren't super high. We have not 'run our course', that's total nonsense. And being 'too cautious' has absolutely no danger. We went through a lockdown and are fine. Other countries went through lockdowns and are fine. The lockdowns didn't destroy any economies or do any of the things the wackaloons were saying they would.",

It's not up in the air, we know it did not happen and it's absurd to suggest it did.\n\nStaying closed is extremely good when it prevents hundreds of thousands of people from dying. Reopening safely is the whole point and it clearly is not safe to re-open right now, especially with explosions in infection rates in the rest of the country. \nThere's absolutely no argument for re-opening the campuses, schools can be done online so that's it, do them on-line. Even with little kids in the lower grades you can at least pretend socialization is super important, but that argument doesn't exist for adults in college. All the campuses will be is infection sites.\nAnd this is CUNY's fault too, they've done absolutely nothing to make the campuses safe. They haven't even limited class size.",

I hope three weeks from now i'm arguing with someone else on the internet about the spike in cases after 4th of July that didn't happen.\n\nThere is a greater than zero chance that the North East has run it's course. I agree that there is also a distinct possibility that we didn't, but the only way to know is if we push the envelope a little bit in preparation for potentially returning in fall.\n\nIs the possibility that the reason NYC got slammed so hard and so fast is because it hit damn near everyone due to pop density that absurd? Is the potential that the other states didn't see what they're seeing until now because lower pop density and car commuter culture gave them time to buckle down, and that this is indeed their \"first wave\" really that preposterous? I get the sense you're being willfully obtuse. \n\nI don't disagree that what your saying is very much a possibility. But it is not the only possibility, and pretending like it is serves no constructive purpose. \n\nAnd yes: Online learning is crap compared to IRL. Poorer learning outcomes, increased cheating.

I\u2019m finally about to go back to school, and would like to get a dual bachelors degree in software engineering and statistics. I\u2019m not sure which the best CUNY is for this, or if there even is a CUNY school that has both majors, or if I can take one major at one school and the other at a different school? I\u2019m not really sure how to proceed and any guidance would be much appreciated.",

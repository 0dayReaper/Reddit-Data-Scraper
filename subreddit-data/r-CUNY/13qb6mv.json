    "postText": "I did very bad in the Math Placement Test and when I open the MyCity and under \"Initial Math Course Placement\" it states \"Math 19000\" Is this a bad class? I wanted to be placed into pre-calc at-least, is it possible for me to take pre-calc instead of Math 19000 or I need to complete Math 19000 first? I am very confused, help.",

Now don\u2019t quote me on this, but you could probably ask the Math Department to take the final for Math 19000 and if you score an 80+, then they\u2019ll pass you for the class. Just confirm with them. \n\nAnd you probably were prepared for the Math Placement Test, that test is just BS that is in another alien language \ud83d\ude02. FYI, the Math department sucks at CCNY so be ready to send a lot of emails or go in person. Good luck!",

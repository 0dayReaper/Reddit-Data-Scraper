I would love for her to attend a CUNY, but I\u2019m worried it will be hard for her to be accepted because she\u2019s OOS. Thoughts on what the school looks for out of state? Her grades are good, and we wouldn\u2019t need financial aid. She hates FL and wants to get out of here.",

            "comment": "There are not really separate considerations or qualifications for out-of-state students. Generally, the same academic considerations apply to all applicants. Your daughter should be aware that CUNY colleges are composed primarily of commuter students. There is not a lot of socializing, as most students go to class and then go home or to work. Also, only a very small percentage of students live in college dorms, and some CUNY schools do not offer dorms at all, so most OOS students have off-campus housing they arrange themselves. CUNY is not a TV show version of going to college. It can be good, just have realistic expectations.",

What I do know is that OOS tuition is more than instate tuition. \n\nNy state resident per year cost: 6,930$\nOOS per year cost: 18,600$\n\nThis is for full time, not sure about part time. At 18k a year I may look at other options besides CUNY.",

They gave us the option to get an INC grade and then submit the work in Jan (so they aren\u2019t feeling the pressure and we have more time to submit assignments) and they will update the INC grade in the spring. I was like, why would I wanna possibly work after the semester is over? I paid out of pocket for X amount of weeks, not gonna work a day after that so they have \u201cmore time\u201d to grade.",

Since they have no control over it they can't give a date or guarantee I'll recieve it. I guess we're the unlucky ones who haven't had ours listed yet- it would be really reassuring to see it. They don't know why mine is not there since I told them my brother got it and our EFC is 0 so I'm just gonna sit tight until it shows",

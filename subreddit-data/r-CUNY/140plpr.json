It might not matter to you, but Hunter doesn\u2019t have a campus the way the other three do. Otherwise you should just visit them all, look at the chemistry department webpages, and just pick. You really can\u2019t go wrong.",

Lehman is also a great school, if I had to eliminate one I\u2019d say Hunter because they only have chemistry ba and most people would prefer a bs as it\u2019s more beneficial for graduate school. I also am a chemistry major at city college and would be happy to answer any questions you may have about the school.",

Classes are extremely competitive, and many are \u201cweeding out\u201d courses were a majority of students fail. Professors are cold hearted lol. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to graduate with a good GPA and mentally healthy, I would personally suggest Lehman. I took a biochemistry course there and absolutely thrived. The campus is amazing, and the professors were kind. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to be challenged, and work closely with brilliant professors, Hunter is your best bet. \n\nGood luck! And feel free to PM me if you have any questions about Lehman or Hunter.",

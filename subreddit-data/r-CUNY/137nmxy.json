    "postText": "Hey there \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd. So I graduated last year in January of 2022, got a job in another state, moved there for a year. I am now moving back to NYC where I lived for 15 years. \n\nI am planning on going back to grad school at Hunter College full time in the Fall, already applied waiting on a response. However it didn\u2019t occur to me that I might have to pay out of state tuition.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this kind of situation? If I have to pay full tuition would it be possible to take a few credits in the fall and spring then after a year qualify for in state tuition?",

I\u2019m moving back to my home state as well after some time away, and will apply for college there. My DL/Voters/taxes are still tied to my home state, but the only problem is that I haven\u2019t been physically present there.",

Main thing that helped was I had a bank account tied to NYC and my driving license which , so those bills helped. Also I graduated from both high school and college in NYC which helped a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: hope this link helps, https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/university-tuition-fee-manual/iv-residency/#part1b",

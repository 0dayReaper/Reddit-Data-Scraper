    "postText": "Hey, y'all, I am a high school senior currently debating on three CUNY colleges for a Computer Science degree. John Jay, Hunter College, and City College of New York have all interested me. Admittedly John Jay has yet to appeal to me as much because of the negative reviews I have heard from the school. But I am leaning towards Hunter college because of the convenience of traveling. But I want to listen to others' opinions for a good CUNY for Computer Science. I have heard excellent things from both City and Hunter. Any help is much appreciated! Thank you!",

She has a heavy Chinese accent that makes her class incomprehensible. I had to go to the lab daily for help because I couldn't understand the work.\n\nHonestly, your best bets might be either City college or Brooklyn college.",

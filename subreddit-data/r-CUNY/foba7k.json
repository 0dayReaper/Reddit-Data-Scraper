            "comment": "I'm having the opposite problem. Got professors trying to teach classes like we're in person and completely disregarding:\n\n* The video programs they are suggesting to be used do not work well for everyone.\n* Not coming up with an actual distance learning plan that foregoes needing to be part of a live lecture to learn the material (Applies to classes without the need for labs obviously).\n* Not recording the lessons and/or uploading in a timely fashion so that people can utilize them if they can't make the class times.\n* Some professors are really poor at communicating to the class resulting in assignments not being done properly because of lack of effective guidance.\n\nI have two different class group chats where we are constantly remarking about how confused we are and have no one to communicate with to resolve our issues because some professors refuse to take any accountability. I understand this is a change for everyone but the students, whom have the most to lose in this situations, are gonna be screwed over in all of this. Please refund my money and erase all record of me starting this semester if this is what I have to look forward to.",

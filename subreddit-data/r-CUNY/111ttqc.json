If you were randomly selected for a Covid test, you can go to any campus offering it and they will ask for your emplid and you will do the test there, only at cuny locations. If you want to enter another cuny, you must show your ID, schedule and Cleared4Pass and they will allow you to enter but only to the library",

For example, I have admission to two different schools, Hunter and LaGuardia. I ignored my random test since it was during exam times, and my digital id pass never lost its green outline so I could get on campus at LaGuardia, but after I tried to enter at Hunter, my id was deactivated.",

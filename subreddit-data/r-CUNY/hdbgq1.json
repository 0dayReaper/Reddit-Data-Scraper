The summer semester is almost over and If they were thinking of taking that route, they should have informed the students ahead of time, at least two weeks notice. I am a cuny student and I have two kids. When I take my exam online at least i can keep them distracted with tv in order to take the exam. However, if I were to go on campus I dont have the option to leave them with family.",

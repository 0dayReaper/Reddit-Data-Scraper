    "postText": "I'm interested in going to grad school at Hunter for Urban Planning, and am wondering what a typical class schedule looks like. Specifically, do most grad degrees tend to offer evening classes, are there remote classes available, is it possible to juggle working (even part-time) while doing the degree? I'm in the early stages of looking at places to apply so any insight is appreciated!",

As a student there, i felt they placed heavy emphasis on learning. Yet the teachers lacked understanding, flexibility, and were a hindrance in many ways when it comes to going above and beyond as a student. \n\nAs a student who flunked out of Hunter(yes, but everything happens for a reason)- that was the wake up call I needed to know I deserve better. \n\n\nThe academic committee denied my re-entrance application two semesters in a row. (I had a death in the family, and became a caregiver at night for a family member who suffers night terrors). Thankfully my student adviser there was one of the bests. I couldn\u2019t have been more thankful for his insight cause Hunter was hell.",

A lot of students will double up classes to avoid going to campus multiple nights. Let me know if you have any questions.",

I started during COVID and that was definitely missing. Because, a lot of people in the program are already working(many in the field but definitely not all) those informal conversations before/after class are such a value add.",

That\u2019s great to hear, as I\u2019d definitely want to keep working so I can, ya know, afford to live \ud83d\ude05 And noted about the networking - I\u2019m curious how big the classes are and how many other MUP students there are in each year?\n\nDo you have any insight as to how likely it is to get scholarships/fellowships? I wish they gave a little more info on requirements to qualify for each scholarship on their website. And I\u2019m also wondering how anal they are about proving residency. I\u2019d love to apply for Spring 24 but wouldn\u2019t have a full year back in NY by then, so I\u2019m wondering if I should just wait for Fall. \n\nThank you again, this was super helpful!",

I think each fall has a class of 30-40 students with an additional 20 students that start in the spring. Because some students are part time and some are full time- we don\u2019t have years per say. Everyone does it on their own time/schedule.\n\nI do not know how in state tuition or scholarships work.",

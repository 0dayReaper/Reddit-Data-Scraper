    "postText": "Today is indeed is the first day of class, I want to start off by saying that you will all do great this semester. I know many aren't looking forward to it but trust me when I say we will all get through it together. This semester we will prove that no matter what is thrown at us we can survive and continue to focus not just on our studies but our daily lives. We will focus and work hard, and in the end we will all make it, I want all my Kings &amp; Queens to keep their heads up through this semester and beyond.\n\nThe CUNY Directory of Discord Servers will always be there to assist you, please refer to the directory to join your college server, receive assistance, and connect with classmates\n\nStay up Kings and Queens",

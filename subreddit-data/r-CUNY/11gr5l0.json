    "postText": "I sent my transcript through the mail over a month ago and I've recently checked my cunyfirst application to see updates on my application status. Under the tab labeled \"Application To Do Items\" it says \"Required\" beside \"Official H.S. Transcript\"; above it there's text that states whenever then words \"Required\" there's something that I need to do on my end to make sure everything is correct. However, under the tap listed \"School and Transcripts\" it says that my transcript has been received/evaluated since the 26th of January. This is a bit confusing for me as I don't know what to do at this point--if there is anything for me to do at all about it. Is this behavior normal for the website? Is there anything left for me to do on my end?",

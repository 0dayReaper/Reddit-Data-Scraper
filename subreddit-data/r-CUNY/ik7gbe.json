    "postText": "Attention all students:\n\nColleges within CUNY will be implementing various online proctoring software, such as Proctorio, through partnerships with McGraw Hill Connect and other publishers. This software requests high level access to your personal device including access to personal data and keylogging permissions which raises serious privacy concerns and risks. Please read and sign the petition below for further details on the matter: [https://www.change.org/CUNY-Privacy](https://www.change.org/CUNY-Privacy)\n\nWe need your help to bring this to the attention of all administrators and officials throughout the CUNY system. Thank you.",

All that was required from professors was that it be included as a note in the Syllabus that it may be something used later in the semester.  I wasn't able to access the syllabus for one of my classes until the day of the class.  If this shit goes through I'm withdrawing",

But they haven't implememted it CUNY wide yet. \n\nStudents really need to speak up about this directly to the departments and the dean of students and make their voice heard for each instance too. An online petition is fine but it is going to take a whole semester to build up a large number of names on it. Once profs start using it, they'll defend future use by saying 'we've been using it already'.",

It's definitely worth emailing them still, but contacting City central to voice concerns is the more important route right now.\n\nUnfortunately the chair did not provide contact information so I'll just be sending lots of emails most likely",

They mention 2 proctoring vendors, neither of which are Proctorio. They also explicitly stated that professors cannot compel students to accept the terms and conditions of the proctoring software and must provide reasonable assessment accomodations if students refuse.

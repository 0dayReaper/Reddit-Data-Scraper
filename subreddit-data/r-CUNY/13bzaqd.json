    "postText": "hey everyone! today inside of the main building  (199 chambers st) know what happened this morning that resulted in an evacuation?\n\nmy class today was in the south side of the building all the way in the end of the building. at around 10:30 alarms went off but there was this announcement that said this is just a test, not an emergency. the alarms stopped about 5 minutes later so we resume class. out of nowhere a man who worked for the school  came into the classroom and said we have to evacuate and told us to rush. me and some classmates walked from the south side to the north side. once we crossed over to the north side of the building i noticed that the alarms weren\u2019t going off on the south side but on the north side of the building. campus security ran up from the emergency exit and yelled at us to go downstairs and leave the building. by the time me and my classmates got out the building there was already a lot of people who were outside. we were one of the last students to come out the building.  \n\ni really do hope this was some sort of drill but bmcc honestly has to work on the emergency alarms. what if there was a mass shooting? the south side of the building had no alarm while the north side did!!! it\u2019s so dangerous i hope bmcc sends out some sort of statement because campus security was yelling at us to leave which caused a lot of panic",

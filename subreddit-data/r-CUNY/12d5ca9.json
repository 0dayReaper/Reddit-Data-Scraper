(meaning you got a refund.) i keep seeing posts about financial aid not covering summer classes, but when i was at BMCC, i took a full slate(4 classes) and it covered that, AND a winter class. it's how i was able to graduate in one year vs two. good luck with everything. talk to an advisor if you can.",

Also, when filing for FAFSA or TAP, you have to make sure you include summer program on the application. \n\nYou can also check with your Financial Aid office. (I know they suck) They\u2019ll be able to advise you better. \n\nGood luck!",

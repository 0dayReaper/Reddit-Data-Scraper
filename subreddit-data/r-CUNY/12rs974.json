    "postText": "Hi, I recently accepted my enrollment offer to City College and paid the commitment deposit to CCNY and I have proof that I did (on both the my city website and proof of receipt) but for some reason my CUNYFIRST account says I am student of Queens College? I don\u2019t know why. It also said I paid a commitment deposit to them (QC) but I didn\u2019t? I\u2019m so confused. Also for CCNY, they changed my intended major from CS to Undeclared and both of my start terms for Queens and CCNY to summer of 2023 from the original fall of 2023? Please if anyone knows what to do I\u2019d really appreciate the help. I don\u2019t know what to do, I want to go to CCNY not Queens College and do CS (the major I applied for) and start fall of 2023.",

I would reach out to QC and tell them that you didn\u2019t commit to them and get further assistance from them. Every CUNY student are changed to Undeclared; however, your first semester classes will correspond to any pre reqs for your major. The term is changed to Summer 2023 because you could, if you want, take summer courses to get ahead or don\u2019t want to take it in the fall semester.",

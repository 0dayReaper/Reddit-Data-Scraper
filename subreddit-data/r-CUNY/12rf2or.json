    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m enrolling for classes in the fall because enrollment dates just opened up. There\u2019s a class that serves as a pre-requisite for another class I gotta take. I have no problems with the pre-req because I already have an interest in it. It\u2019s scheduled for really late. Plus, I\u2019m trying to avoid late classes. However, I\u2019m willing to enroll if it\u2019s asynchronous. But, it says it\u2019s hybrid asynchronous. I know what hybrid is. I know what asynchronous is. But, WTF is hybrid asynchronous?!",

So, one of my classes normally would meet M/W, but with hybrid async we meet on Wednesdays and the prof has our assignments/exams due on Mondays, that's the async part. My other professor doesn't care about the async thing though and all our work is due before class on Thursday, instead of Tuesday, which would be the other day we would have had class if it weren't hybrid. I've only seen it with m/w and t/th classes, don't know if it would or how it could work with Friday or weekend blocks",

    "postText": "My application process hasn't gone smoothly at all and hasn't been anywhere near as simple as CUNY admissions claimed it would be. I applied to 4 schools and they said I would get an acceptance email in 2 weeks, but it has now been 2 weeks and I've heard nothing. \n\nOne of the schools I reached out to directly and they immediately declined my application within 24 hours of asking lol. But as for the other 3, I've heard nothing. I have double--checked my email and can confirm for sure I haven't received any acceptance emails.\n\nSo I randomly checked CUNYFirst and see that one of the schools accepted me and there's an \"Accept Offer\" (I never received an email of this btw) button, but on my other 2 schools, I have no such button and haven't heard anything by email either. Their CunyFirst section looks exactly like the school that declined me, so am I to assume my application was declined for both those schools as well? I'd really like to know if I got accepted in these 2 picks or not before accepting the one I did get into, because the one that accepted me was my last pick.\n\n------- Edit\nLooks like it was a delayed response. Apparently CUNYFirst updates before they email u. But the acceptance emails just started rolling in this morning. Got one for BMCC and BC. Now just waiting on CCNY so I can make a decision. I think I'm good now. Thanks all!\ud83d\ude18",

You can always call and ask the status of your application for the two schools you haven\u2019t heard from, but it\u2019s possible they\u2019re still evaluating your application. Not sure why you didn\u2019t get an email from the one school but if you have an \u201caccept offer\u201d button that means you\u2019ve been accepted to that school.",

BMCC accepted my application but I haven't accepted their offer yet because I am still waiting to hear from CCNY and BC.\n\nCoincidentally, I just saw a new message from BC a few minutes ago in CUNYFirst that I have to meet with an advisor because my major (Computer Science) requires some criteria. I don't know what that's about. Don't know if that means if I was accepted or not but to me it's just more confusion.\n\nAnd my top pick CCNY I haven't heard anything from at all whatsoever.",

They had emailed my undergrad email address ages ago with some follow up questions (instead of the one I had on my application/resume) bec they knew I was an undergrad student there before. They said they assumed I lost interest or was going to another school since I never replied \ud83d\ude05 But yeah we got it all sorted and I started my classes a couple of weeks later",

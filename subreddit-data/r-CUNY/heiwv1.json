With the amount of budget cuts throughout CUNY, adjuncts being laid off left and right and the fact that CUNY might see an increase in enrollment if other universities go online (cost difference) I can\u2019t see a scenario where we are at anything above 25% capacity.\n\nDifferent departments may do things differently (I.e computer / lab classes still need to be done on campus) but in all honestly, a large amount of lectures can be done at home. Online classes can be just as effective if the professor develops them properly",

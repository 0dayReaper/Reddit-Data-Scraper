My professor is from Nepal. He took the initiative to fundraise at CCNY for Nepal victims. He told me other STUDENTS were fundraising too, but they kept the money. $0 to Nepal. \n\nScams are happening everywhere all the time. Have to be careful \n\nBe careful of recruiters who hire you for MLM. That\u2019s common. \n\nSome recruiters hire students to do the illegal. Students fall victim because they need money and want job experience. Always be careful. \n\nCollege students have very formative minds. They are one of the easy targets to scam \n\nJust because a piece of paper is hanging on campus does not mean that piece of paper originated from faculty. Heck, anyone can walk into any campus and hang a paper that is a scam. Some folks do this with paid research studies and focus groups. More scams!",

The person helps them and takes out cash from their account and the person leaves with the money. Such a shitty scam to be doing to fellow students.",

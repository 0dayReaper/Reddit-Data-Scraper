The last time my mother caught it, she was severely ill and could barely get up and eat for 2-3 weeks and had to use an inhaler for low oxygen. My father hasn't caught it yet, but he's going to have a major surgery soon and will be off his feet for 3 months. I cannot be expected to come into the campus 3 times a week and risk them getting sick. If anything, I'd rather drop out from my registered classes that are in-person/hybrid, and just deal with graduating late because my family means more to me than CUNY and their stupid policies ever could.",

I have no time to rush out of work to catch an unreliable express bus, and sit in a classroom learning it when I can just study the material on my own. At least with online classes, I can handle 4-5 classes a semester, plus winter and summer classes.",

I have to email 150+ people and I am slow with it because of this crap. And more work piles up on top of that lol. But CUNY doesn't want to address what's happening, no information, no communication, each college can communicate with its students, faculty, and staff, but so far mine as not. They plan on continuing their winter commencement AFAIK at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing in person immediately is going to make everyone sick and, my symptoms aren't just cold symptoms, its the general covid symptoms with the vaccine + booster shot I got. Imagine if I wasn't vaccinated. No, don't feel safe, and nobody should until the surge decreases. We could be remote even for 1-2 months then go back in person. Severe pro and cons to both and not really one real good answer that anybody can do at this point.",

(due to instructors not being able to teach and not being able to be covered by anyone else due to availability issues). with all these missed quizzes / exams and the need for makeups (impossible @ those kind of numbers - makeups for exams by end of term would be in the hundreds), we literally will not be able to function.  \n\nso, either we A) have no restrictions unless someone is physically unable to come they can come regardless of covid status (violates entire CDC guidelines) or B) have no graded work in the in person part of the course, in which case nobody will come for it. or C) have it run online, as we did for 3 terms in a row without major issues.  \n\nthis isn't a darn hospital. this can be done from home and not risk these students' families and our staff to the unknowns of omicron.",

Under 25 years old and vaccinated its almost never happens anymore unless you have serious issues which then you should just stay in your bubble at home.\n\nThe new variant is much less lethal and spreads very easily, everyone will be exposed to it and cases will come down very sharply in a few weeks just like it did in south africa.",

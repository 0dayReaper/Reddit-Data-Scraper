Some teachers are fine over 12 weeks but some dont adjust their material/lessons for condensed semesters and it leaves the students feeling lost. I took an earth science and a psych class completely asynchronously over summer and both were easy because the teachers set it up appropriately. Had a winter english class and it was awful cause the teacher kept giving deadlines but was often late uploading the required blog posts to accompany the reading.",

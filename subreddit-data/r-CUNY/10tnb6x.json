    "postText": "Hey guys, would any of you know how to get a course override? There's a class I want to take in second spring session but that puts me at 19 credits instead of 14. Is there any way to submit a course override? At my old school, I just had to submit a form from my school home page. CUNYFirst is kinda annoying to navigate. Or do I have to reach out to an advisor for that sort of thing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Took a chem 1 class last semester which was all incoming freshman and within the first month we went from 75 students to 45 with only 15 people passing at the end. Only those 15 people studied and did the hw. Same thing with a calculus class where everyone failed and didn\u2019t bother talking with the professor even once. Is it just CSI or all cunys like this ?",

Their dream job is to become an influencer. \n\n\nIt's all fun and games until these same kids turn 30, and they have nothing to show for it. Meanwhile, those 15 kids in your Chem class will likely have careers, families, house/houses and a social status. The kids that wasted time being cool will be filled with regret as their filling out their job application...at white castle.\n\n\nThe best part? They still won't take any personal responsibility and will resort to saying things like \"that person is lucky\" uh no, you're just trash. That person worked their asses off.",

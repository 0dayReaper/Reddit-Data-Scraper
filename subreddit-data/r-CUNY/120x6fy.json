    "postText": "I just need to vent and see if anyone else can relate to this. CUNY in general has given me a lot of issues- lack of communication, guidance, ect. My biggest regret is joining the honors program. I feel like it was gravely misrepresented. They steamrolled my schedule with repetitive and heavy honors classes- I take one class that relates to my field. They\u2019re forcing me to stay an extra year for requirements even though I\u2019m financially struggling and have almost all my credits. They make us come to a class every friday even though it could be on zoom (and in this class, people just talk about BS, not even academic stuff). I\u2019ve told them I work 2 (and in the school lab) and they don\u2019t care. I can\u2019t handle the stress but it\u2019s not worth it to drop out of the honors program. Thanks for listening and any input would be appreciated",

If you are technically almost done, how did you only take 1 class pertaining to your major? \n\nI don\u2019t think employers particularly care about whether or not you were in an honors program. In fact many won\u2019t even ask for your gpa. If your a bright person, present yourself well and have good communication skills, that\u2019s what matters today. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your in a shitty situation. You should be more adamant about graduating on time.",

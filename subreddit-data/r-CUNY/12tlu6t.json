    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm a senior at City College of New York majoring in Economics. I want to get into the Finance sector but I have 0 experience and 0 internships. I am well aware in order for me to land an entry level jobs as a banker or in wealth/asset management I need to have an internship or a referral and I don't have both. Do you recommend me doing Master's in Finance right after my undergrad or CFA 1?",

I\u2019m definitely thinking about Master\u2019s in Finance right after graduate school. Is it worth it to take out loans to get to Fordham Business School or stay in Cuny and go for Baruch",

    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all. I\u2019m asking here because my school is terrible at replying to emails especially after the summer, and no appointments are available as well. I just found out my TAP for 23-24 was denied because were over the limit. (My mom and I combined is 81k instead of 80k limit.) this isn\u2019t really great news as we all know the cost of living in NYC is crazy and no way I can pay for that. I want to know if excelsior would still cover the costs of my tuition? I also get Vallone scholarship as well- would I have to pay fees still? I never have before and I have no idea what\u2019s going on. My dad just passed away and I was excited to get time to grieve but now I can\u2019t stop thinking about this and I\u2019m really upset. Any help is greatly appreciated!!!",

But, if you don't have a due balance before the scholarship is applied, then you would receive 0. The scholarship is supposed to be just for our tuition so that's why.",

I also read online they only give 5,500 a year, so that's also why I'm worried. I only got about 250 from tap though. This is insane for my last year after what I went through, I find this horrible.",

That\u2019s what happened to me. However, I still had to pay like $350 in student fees that excelsior doesn\u2019t cover.",

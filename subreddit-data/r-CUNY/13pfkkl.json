    "postText": "I wasn't taking things seriously a few years ago, but now that I'm back, I'm no longer making jokes about my classes. I wanted to major in computer science but 301 and 302 terrified me so I switched to CIS to pursue my interests in web development, cybersecurity, and other IT/programming fields. However, I still feel bad about switching my major because all I really needed were two math classes. Does anyone have a Cis here. Only reason I switch was because I know I can get my CIS easy because I like the things in it but also cause math isn't a thing in it. Another reason is because I know CS will take a few years and I don't really have time like when I was younger. I just wanna know if anyone here has a CIS degree and how are they doing,can I get a good paying job and should I keep going",

            "comment": "Well, for the record, the worst mistake is to switch your degree last minute. You do not have the time and money to do so. Not to mention, there are still math classes associated with CIS. I switched also from CSC to CIS to find out at the end that there are still math classes that will get in the way. I am shit at math because I can not convince myself that I need it and therefor will never put my full mental abilities into it. Dude, if I were you, I would get all the help I can get for those two classes, I would risk failing them as much as 4 times or getting 4 W's in order to get it done. 2 classes should not be the excuse to do this to yourself. Worst case scenario take the courses online and have a genius on hand next to you. And just for the record. IT people and CSC people think that they do not need each other and they are wrong buddy. Not realistically, but the clowns that are responsible for hiring staff are for some reason requiring an IT guy to know HTML and Python and then the CSC guys are required to know some networking. They are slowly merging and that is why not a lot of CUNY schools offer this degree. So far I know of BMCC as an Associate, Baruch and SPS as a Bachelor's.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve just been admitted into Queen College this past month for the fall \u201823 term as a freshman. I didn\u2019t realize my FAFSA was selected for verification and just saw it as a task in my CunyFirst account. The due date for verification was Feb 21st and I just did the verification tasks today(Feb 26). Will this result in me getting no aid?? Or will my aid package be delayed. Also I applied to Macaulay Honors so will that be affected in anyway?",

I have friends and people who got selected for verification during the first few weeks of classes AND still end up getting aid! Since you submitted it today, I think it should be ok\u2026 but if it makes you feel better, contact Queens College Financial Aid office to let them know you submitted it and ask them if it\u2019ll affect your aid and Macaulay Honors acceptance in any way. Good luck!",

I\u2019m not recommending you wait that long but it always worked out in my favor in the end. You should be okay but I agree with ^ to contact the Financial Aid office",

It is mostly just undergrads posting questions about financial aid, dropping courses, and holds.\n\nIf you got your GC email already, i suggest signing up for an account at the official commons for GC.\n\n\nhttps://commons.gc.cuny.edu/\n\nAlso look-up Groups that match your interest. Some require permissions.\n\nhttps://commons.gc.cuny.edu/groups/international-students-graduate-center/\n\nEdit: Also, welcome to GC.",

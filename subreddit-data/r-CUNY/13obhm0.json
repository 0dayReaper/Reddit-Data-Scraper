Chemistry 2 and biology 2 would generally be taken in your second semester. \n\nI recommend looking at your DegreeWorks to see your core or major requirements, depending on what you want to take first. \n\nI would also recommend looking at the guides on the premed subreddit r/premed because it summarizes what you need to do before you apply to med school in the US.",

Unless you're Newton, you cant just invent calc as you go.\n\nHowever, if you have already had pre-calc, then I think you're better off taking calc right away. Your best bet will be to have a strong foundation with algebra and trig",

You\u2019ll want to balance maintaining a high GPA with the desire to get through quickly, especially if you plan to go onto graduate a school. A standard 12 - 15 credit course load in your first semester is already a lot to adjust to. That said, you\u2019ll discuss the options for more courses with your advisor.",

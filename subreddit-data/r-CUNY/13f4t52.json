            "comment": "Depends on which school of engineering you're applying to. Theres like a dozen different schools of learning that all fall under GSoE. The requirements are on their website if you look for Grove School of Engineering on it. If youre applying to their school of Computer Science, I can tell you for sure you will not get in just from doing well in placements tests. From what I understood when I went to CCNY's open house, if I remember right, it requires at least a 2.7GPA with a heavy preference towards applicants who have a strong academic background in science and/or math courses. The speaker gave the impression that you will need extra classes to meet the requirements so it sounded like it would be very difficult to get in being a freshman without that when there will be more favorable applicants who will be applying with strong STEM backgrounds. I remember her specifically saying dont even bother applying if your GPA is below 2.7 because they won't even look at it. But again, go check for yourself. Every single requirement is clearly outlined on their website and the requirements do look quite competitive",

But if you really don't care that much either way, then go with another CUNY like BC, QC. Or you could even go to one of those or BMCC, which I've also heard has a good 2-year CS program, and then transfer into Grove.\n\nBut it sounds to me you're more interested in Grove so I'd suggest going for that. It can't hurt to apply. All they can say is no but at least you'll know what you need to do to get in next time or you might even get in as a freshman, who knows. Just my 2 cents",

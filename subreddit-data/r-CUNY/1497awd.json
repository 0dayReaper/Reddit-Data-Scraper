    "postText": "Hi.  I just finished up my freshman year and I got a F in one of my classes.  I went through the approval  process to take the course at a college closer to me (I am out of state) and it was approved.  I passed the class and it transferred in, but the \"F\" is still factored into my GPA since it is CUNY's policy that the only way to have the F removed from the GPA calculation is to take the class at the same \"Institution\" you received the F from.  Is there any way to appeal this policy?  I feel there is no logic at all around why it needs to be retaken at the same college you got the F in.  Since I was approved to take the course from another college, and passed it, who cares that it was not through the same college?  Any help in how I could have this looked at would be appreciated.",

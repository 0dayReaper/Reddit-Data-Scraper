            "comment": "When I transferred to Hunter, once I accepted, you either had to put down a commitment deposit or if you\u2019re coming from another CUNY wait until the waiver cleared. Then you\u2019d get an email a couple days later about how they\u2019re evaluating your transfer credits. Once they do that, you can sign up for classes. You have to declare your major and concentration before the fall (I think mid September for fall 2023). There will be a transfer orientation you can sign up for once they email you your NetID. Your NetID is used to declare a major, your campus card, etc. I got mine 2ish weeks after I accepted the offer, so it does take some time once you accept.",

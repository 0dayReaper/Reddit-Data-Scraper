I know there is a placement exam for math(I still don\u2019t know how to sign up for it) but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s also other things I need to do. I\u2019m currently a high school senior",

For the math placement test check this [link](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/testing/math-placement-test). I\u2019d recommend studying Precalculus and Trigonometry if your HS didn\u2019t have those classes so that you can get to Calculus as that\u2019s a major requirement. Kahn Academy is good for those, here\u2019s the [pre-calc](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) course and the [trig](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry) course. Hope this helps!",

You need it in order to proceed to the math levels for your degree. The placement test is to determine where you start. Some schools also have workshops to prepare students for the test.",

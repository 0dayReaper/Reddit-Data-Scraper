If you\u2019re low income or your family is dirt poor, you literally attend CUNY with a full ride due to the Pell Grants and you\u2019ll likely receive a refund. They will still have access to college. I have many friends who receive full rides and then some and aren\u2019t in ASAP.\n\nHow about students like me that come from middle class households but are considered \u201cmaking too much\u201d to qualify for shit and don\u2019t get help from their parents and have to pay 100% out of pocket? Why do these politicans use low income students as a talking point without doing their research? Those students will still be receiving the same Pell and TAP aid next year. \n\nHow about middle class students like me who rely on ASAP for metrocard and books because they have to work a job 4 days a week in order to pay out of pocket? While low income students are being used as talking point by some politician, other middle class students and myself will be shafted once again. \n\nAs long as they don\u2019t cut the metrocard and textbook vouchers, I\u2019m okay with them cutting ASAP Fall Classes. They have no true benefits.",

It dwarfs many city departments which are understaffed for the service they perform. Overall, this is all politics written by bullshit greedy politicians.\n\n\"Many public colleges -- including City College of CUNY -- were founded that way. For a time, all of CUNY was tuition-free, but that ended in **1976,** with New York City facing a fiscal crisis.\"\n\nAs per TAP I earn too much therefore ineligible and have gotten laughable PELL grants because of the same reason. This means that a lot of my earnings go to paying for my college and school materials. When I was living with my parents who are lower class it was very very hard getting any help from them since our household income was $80k a year. As much as I sympathize and relate with you it sucks but again, it's bullshit politics.",

            "comment": "I am speaking from the perspective of someone who lives below the poverty line and who qualifies fully for all financial aid and then some. These are my own views. **This is a response to all the middle-class posters in this thread. Let me spell this out for you:**\n\n**As a middle class person, your college worries probably stop at paying for college.**\n\n**As a poor person, there are** ***many problems beyond financial issues***\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\n\\-How do they afford decent living conditions? Do they have the right environment that is conductive for learning? Poor households often have unstable environments (I have a legit dysfunctional family, with family members who have criminal backgrounds, alcoholic issues and where domestic violence can and has erupted at the most inopportune moments even if I'm trying to study for example). Try dealing with that your entire life and tell me how academics, much less college, is the least of your concern.\n\n\\-How do they afford basic living essentials (toilet paper, shampoo, soap, etc.) as students who have not been taught the know-how nor without the support system in place? A good chunk of my financial aid goes into paying for things in my household because otherwise we cannot afford it.\n\n\\-How do they afford the space to study? As someone who values their privacy but who's never had  their own room (because hey, when you're poor, you get any place that you can get), it'd be a blessing to my productivity if I had my own space\n\n\\-How do they afford decent nutrition? Living in areas with no easy access to the freshest produce/grocery is stress and anxiety inducing, especially when you wake up hungry and guess what no food, because you forgot to buy some when you couldn't afford to get many in bulk.\n\n\\-How can we get decent sleep? That plays  Again, in NYC you get what you can. As someone who's had to share rooms *my entire life*  with people *who have had severe legal and psychological issues,* that leads to severe stress and anxiety in itself. Again, speaking from experience, it's not nice to sleep on a couch for your entire life (i've never had a bed) near unstable and obnoxious people who can disturb your sleep cycle at 3 or 4 AM...\n\n\\-How do they deal with domestic issues? As someone who comes from a single parent household with a parent who struggles with depression and inconsistent, minimum wage work, it's not that nice\n\n\\-How do they afford textbook costs? Metrocards? Even if you qualify fully for financial aid, it's still not enough money.\n\n\\-The average poor person does not have the access or the know-how to navigate the college academic system. That's what happens when your parents (or parent) is uneducated and you are the first to go to college, when you cannot afford services like private tutoring, prep courses/books, etc. I did not know other parents played a large role in the educational process of their kids for example. I've never had any sort of intervention in my education, with everything I learned about how to afford college, the academic opportunities, etc. I learned from access to the internet.\n\nAnd to tell you the truth, I think I'm pretty well off compared to some other poor people. I live in a shared, very cramped, cluttered and dirty apartment (mold on peeling walls, rats are a regular sight, there are days when I don't eat to save money, etc.) with people I don't like but it's rent-stabilized without which I'd be homeless. We don't have an A/C even in this heat and humidity, but hey roof over my head. Financial aid helps to mitigate at least some of those issues. I don't really do anything for fun (I've never went on vacation or know what that's like), but financial aid allows me to afford to survive and it allows me to at least somewhat focus on my studies.\n\nThese are just some of the issues to deal with. I have not listed all of them. And guess what? *I still have to work despite all these obstacles!!!* What a shocker. Most poor people, like you middle-class people, still have to work despite the  financial aid. College costs are far from the only issues we face. My goal in life, and the goal of many other poor people in my position, is to get into the middle class. So yes, my goal in life is to be in the position you were born in.\n\nFinancial aid not a perfect system, but please don't make ignorant posts. Financial aid doesn't give you a stable support system. You are not, in any scenario, worse off than someone who's poor. If you have consistent decent meals, no fear of personal safety, your own space to study, your own space to sleep and recharge, and a decent internet connection then you can find a way to succeed in college *even if you have to work*. If that doesn't resonate with you then again, you have no idea what you're talking about and are sheltered to the realities of what being poor is like. I don't wish the mental and physical taxation on anyone, much less college students trying to understand themselves and what they want out of life.",

Nobody is claiming that low income students are better off in their lives compared to students from middle class household. But solely speaking from the scope of this tweet (which is low income students attending college), this politican is making it seem as if the ASAP program are low income students\u2019 only way to access CUNY. There are TONS of low income students that don\u2019t rely on ASAP and attend CUNY with a full ride. Remember, ASAP is only for community college and plenty of low income students attend CUNY\u2019s 4-year institutions. To be more specific, this politican is point out the budget cutting courses mainly for ASAP students. I\u2019ve taken them. They really have no true benefit as opposed to taking a regular course with students not in ASAP.\n\nIf this politican wants to speak on the experience of low income students then they need to look elsewhere. But it seems as if they\u2019re only using low income students as a talking point based on the gross misinformation presented in the tweet.",

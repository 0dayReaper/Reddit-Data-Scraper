    "postText": "I'm switching from a Business Administration major with a focus of Marketing Management to Business Communications. I'm not sure if I should go with corporate communication or business writing. Originally I thought I would go into marketing but I'm not so sure anymore.\n\nInfo that might be useful: I have an associates degree in Video Arts and Technology, I consider myself a creative person but I\u2019m not super passionate about anything. I\u2019d just like to get a high paying job.",

            "comment": "I'm not sure how well each of these specializations would pay, but business writing feels more useful between the two. Corporate communications sounds generic and vague, business writing lists the applications of the major more clearly and gives me a good idea of what it does without having to dig too deep. It also feels like it has a wider variety of jobs you can apply it to in the first place, and small companies will need business weitera just as much as large ones.\n\nMy vote is on business writing, but only you can decide whether it's right for you in the end.",

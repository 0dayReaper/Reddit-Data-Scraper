            "comment": "I graduated from Stony Brook more than a decade ago. There are big tech recruiter alot at SBU. A few of my classmate from the CS department got into Google right out of college. But I have to say, the classes moves faster and harder in SBU. I also know some friends in CUNY, the pace is slower and it is not as demanding for assignments. Sometimes in SBU because most of the students there already knows alot about programming, they kind of make the professor also moves faster. If there is a curve, they will pull the curve up. If you are a total beginner, CUNY is better to learn. If you are as good as the others, then SBU would be better. But even if you are good, expect the classes to be hard even if you are good at it. But I have to say, classes are harder at Stony Brook.",

If you still can, I\u2019d recommend another CUNY school, like John Jay. Their professors are way better than CCNY, from what I\u2019ve heard. I\u2019ve also went to both, and I would choose John Jay in terms of education and connections anytime.",

You're going to deal with a host of poor administration and lousy professors, and on top of that the whole mess of the Grove School. I find it wild that people are saying Stonybrook is stressful and whatnot and recommending City College. City College puts you through a lot of stress and I don't see the worth. Take the better name for your future resume.",

And if you read the books where he talks about some problems that he tacked down with his students at stony and look them up on LinkedIn, you'll notice that they are working for resounding name companies (the last guy works at Google as a staff engineer in ml in the search division since 2013). If this doesn't make you guess which school is better, then I don't know what to tell you.",

A CS major did an interviewed me for his project and is happy at CCNY. \n\nMEANWHILE\n\nMe and just everyone I knew that went to Stony for STEM. Absolutely hated it! One of my best friends has not fully recovered from undergrad and refused to go for their masters. I did meet some CS majors at Stony. I have no idea what they are doing now. But they were struggling a lot. The goes by two unofficial codes \u201cCs get you degrees\u201d and \u201cbless the curves.\u201d I have never been to a school where majority of the courses have a final curved. If that doesn\u2019t tell you how difficult the classes are. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. \n\nDon\u2019t go to Stony for CompSci. You will be miserable.",

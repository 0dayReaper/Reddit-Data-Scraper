You definitely have to be responsible and make time to do your work but I\u2019ve been doing great so far. I have one class that meets on Wednesday from 6:00-8:30 and I make sure I\u2019m atleast on my way home by 6 so I can focus on it.",

I go to city tech btw. I guess it depends on what your school offers but when I do my schedule I make sure I filter my results for only online classes. This is my first time doing asynchronous but I prefer it over classes that meet on zoom. I understand the content more when I teach myself. It\u2019s based on how you learn so I wouldn\u2019t say just dive into it try a mixture of zoom classes in there as well just to see what you prefer. Make sure as soon as you\u2019re able to make your fall schedule you do because online classes fill up extremely quick. No one wants to go on campus anymore tbh understandably. It\u2019s a more flexible schedule I can work any hours I want because I don\u2019t have to meet for zoom\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

You will literally go to work, eat, go to class, go home and read until you pass out and repeat. Your days off will be for food shopping, laundry and school work. But I would have rather done that and be done in 18 months than be stuck doing part time for 4 years or more. I did this about 8 years ago and night/weekend classes were more forgiving with work load and I always researched my professor on ratemyprofessor back then.",

            "comment": "It is doable but it can also take a toll on you depending on the number of hours you work, your work schedule and number of classes you\u2019re enrolled in. \n\nI worked 5 am to 2 pm one semester and would take classes shortly after. This worked for me as I still had a bit of energy in me after work, but with any class after 6/7 pm, I found myself dozing off and struggling to focus. \nIn another instance I had synchronous classes after work and found myself signing on to zoom and passing out once I sat down. I was drained and too tired to focus. So depending on your job, you may have to think about whether in person, synchronous or asynchronous classes work best for you. \n\nI also found it helpful to not take more than one class on the same day. Because after 8 hours of work it was a challenge to focus in a 2 hour lecture then have another one right after. Exam periods can also be stressful with back to back classes after work. \n\nThis may not be applicable, but depending on your job, see if it\u2019s possible to take a morning class and head into work later and possibly stay later. Ex: class 8am - 10am then work 11am - 7pm. Some colleges also have extremely early classes at 6:30 am which allows persons to work a regular 9-5 depending on how far from the campus they work. \n\nAnother option is asynchronous classes. You can be full time but work on your own time. This works for most people but didn\u2019t work for me because I wasn\u2019t disciplined enough. I needed interactions with my peers and professors and verbal reminders for assignments etc. after classes. \n\nThen there\u2019s the option of weekend classes. I enjoyed weekend classes. The buildings tend to be quieter and less populated than during the week. My only issue was commuting. Train service in the weekend is trash and I found myself having to leave earlier than needed to get to campus in time. Lastly, food options aren\u2019t available on the weekends. So I always had to get vending machine snacks lol. \n\nLastly, I\u2019d say go at your own pace. Don\u2019t overwhelm yourself. If this is your first time doing evening classes, I\u2019d say take 2-3 instead of a full credit load. Or at least practice. By practice, I mean taking 2-3 hours daily after work to read a book or watch a documentary or work on a project. Doing this will allow you to see how your body and mind reacts to the possibilities of evening classes. \n\nGood luck!",

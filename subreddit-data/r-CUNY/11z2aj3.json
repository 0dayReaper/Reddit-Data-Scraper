    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am taking 9 credits at my home college and 6 credits on e-permit, and I am a full-time student, but my TAP disappeared. I know it is due to e-permit credits, but I have heard two different suggestions. First, I should wait until I finish e-permit classes, and then TAP will reappear. Or, ask the financial aid office to make an ''adjustment'' to count e-permit credits and disburse TAP since I am a full-time student. Therefore, I wanted to ask if anyone here had the same situation and was successful to make the financial aid office adjust the e-permit classes before the semester was over. I would appreciate advice on how to approach this situation.",

            "comment": "I was in this boat last spring. I took 9  credits at my home school and 3 credits on a e-permit. I had to wait until the semester ended and get my grade back and transferred to my home school and got my tap  back. Financial aid office \u201ccouldn\u2019t \u201c make an adjustment don\u2019t know if they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t so not every school may have that option  be mindful of that and you may have to wait until you get your grades  back. If your FA office could make an adjustment definitely do that I had the money to pay out of pocket until I got my refund so I wasn\u2019t bothered but if that\u2019s not your case obviously push to get an adjustment.",

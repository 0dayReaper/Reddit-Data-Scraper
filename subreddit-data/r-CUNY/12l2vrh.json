You literally have to give it your all and even then, the professors are still suspicious of you and how you\u2019re doing so well. But if you\u2019re up for the challenge, sure, go to Hunter and try it out!",

I've commented on other posts about this. Instead of starting a new thread go through existing threads about Hunter and BC. You will see what current students are saying especially about Hunter.",

    "postText": "Throwaway account, for obvious reason.  I am a full-time professor at one of the four year campuses. At this point in my life, I am so far removed from the college experience that it's hard for me to understand or even imagine what students are going through right now. At the same time, I am committed to optimizing this (less than ideal) experience for my students to best of my ability. So,my question is what are the biggest challenges for you at the moment, and what do you wish your professors would do to help? I should note that as a professor it is *nearly* impossible to please everyone, but I am very passionate about my job, and would like to learn more about what I can improve on.\n\nETA: If there is anything you would like to know about the professor experience at the moment, I am happy to answer!",

You are really not teaching me anything. I'd appreciate a YouTube video, or even a a narrated powerpoint presentation, that's better than nothing. I am currently taking a capstone course, in my final semester and I am beyond frustrated cause the content is not easy to understand, the professor was MIA for 2 weeks of the semester, there's no live lectures or pre-recorder lectures. It's just a book chapter and a a blackboard discussion post.  We have an assignment due tomorrow,  their directions  were extremely vague, they're not answering emails either, so what the hell am I supposed to do at this point?  I'm literally googling and youtube'ing stuff to see how the hell am I suppose to do this thing. I've even reached out to the director of the department to see if I can be swapped to a different section, taught by different professor but they said that its not possible.\n\nOh and lastly, what I do appreciate is the fact that some professors have decided to include podcasts, films, documentaries, newspaper articles instead of lengthy academic journals that are like 50+ pages. I'm an audio/visual learner so for me that has been a lot easier to work with than those long and in most cases extremely boring and not easy to digest academic journals.",

I understand adjuncts are getting paid pennies on the hour for their work, but this is what we all signed up for.  Personally, I feel like I'm spending a lot more time prepping and working right now than I ever did when I taught face to face. Between recording lectures, uploading videos, answering discussion board posts every week, responding to emails, etc.  I'm sorry some of your professors aren't doing that, and for what it's worth you should definitely note that in the course evaluations (even though I know they don't count for me, they're better than nothing). \nGood tip about the videos &gt; reading!",

What sucks about this capstone is that it is so specific for my major that there's not a lot of useful information online. I can't just go on CourseHero, Chegg or Quizlet and look up things to better understand it. We have a textbook, but even the content of the textbook is not easy to digest. What makes this whole thing even worse is the fact that I have a midterm in about 3 weeks. What the hell are we, the students going to be tested on when we weren't taught anything or explained any of the things that we're reading?  It just makes no damn sense at all.",

It does assume that, like, the students care enough to learn, but at least in the crowds I was a part of, we actually did, and I learned a lot more from peers and reading/talking about their approach than I did from anything else. Everyone was very happy to help each other out, but going to a peer and saying \"can I copy your exam\" was just, like, a total \"nope, happy to explain my process though.\"\n\nSet the bar quite high, give problems which can be approached many different ways, and let them work it out. Doesn't really work for an algebra exam, but is fine for neuroscience, or cellular biology, lots of liberal arts stuff. The job of the student isn't to get a good grade, but to learn, and even going to a peer and being like \"I don't get it\" and being able to see some of their work and have an \"aha\" moment can be very instructive.",

For instance, I'm an insomniac, always have been. One of the things they tell you is not to hang out in bed unless you are going to go to sleep. When you are in bed, it's sleepy time. Build that association.\n\nWhen people are at home, it's not necessarily focused-learning time. That's what the classroom is for. Home is for the other half of your life. Not to be too crude, but have you ever kind of needed to pee, but then the moment you pop the bathroom door open, you suddenly *really* have to pee?

            "comment": "My issues seem like things you are already good about but I will voice them anyways. Most of my professors seem less understanding this semester. I got a 0 on a participation grade because my professor expected us to upload an assignment and email him within 45 seconds and when my scanner wasn\u2019t fast enough he closed the assignment, however when I emailed him a question on a separate assignment he didn\u2019t get back to me until after the due date.I guess expectations on how fast we should email don\u2019t go both ways. I am currently sick and waiting on a covid test but I have another professor who is really reluctant to give me any wiggle room whatsoever. I have another class that is piling on pointless busywork that resembles worksheets I did in middle school, but when we take quizzes the material is so much more advanced. That professor doesn\u2019t communicate very well and I feel I am largely finding learning materials myself so I can pass the class. \n\nFor the first time in my life I had a breakdown due to stress and it was 100% due to my classes  this semester. My biggest takeaway from all of this is everyone is fucking stressed and everyone thinks they\u2019re the only one going through this. I can tell my professors are stressed out and I\u2019m empathetic to that. I\u2019m fucking stressed too. On a side note the labs online are a joke. They are so confusing to me to do online and I feel like whenever I ask a question the lab professors are confused too. I\u2019ve heard \u201cI don\u2019t know just do this\u201d so many times in my labs. \n\nThis semester to me is literally \u201clet\u2019s get through this\u201d not \u201clet\u2019s learn and better myself and prepare for my career\u201d. It\u2019s so sad that this could have been so much better. I was in an online program in a SUNY school to start my college career a while ago and they knew what they were doing and made online learning work. I understand that\u2019s harder to do with a lot of professors who have no experience with remote learning and when you\u2019re forced into it. It\u2019s just such a shame. I know so many students from all over the country and we all share similar stories of just how much this semester sucks and how stressed we are. I\u2019ve thought about withdrawing multiple times so far. Okay ending the rant now. Thanks for asking this.",

Most of those classes were actually asynchronous but with set in stone office hours every week. Communication was fast, assignments made sense, you could work at your own pace but still had a professor to fall back on if you needed/chose. Whatever it was it just seemed to work. However it could have also been the fact that everyone that was in that online program chose to be in it. I\u2019m sure that had an effect.",

What's that?? \nOK, there were optional training workshops available, but they were just an hour here or there, and no one was required to attend. So, there's your answer. The reality is that most of us never get ANY training in teaching, because that's not the focus of most PhD programs. Some people have to teach in grad school to get funding, but that's not universal either.  Most PhD students (at least in my field of Psychology) do not teach in grad school, and focus primarily on research.  Even if you DO teach in grad school it's sink or swim, or you have to seek out opportunities for professional development on your own time.",

Anyway, I think the worst part of this all has been CUNY\u2019s insistence on group projects. Some of us are parents, are working, and have a lot of outside stressors beyond school. It\u2019s very hard to meet outside of class times right now, especially with the overall lack of childcare we\u2019re all facing. Please don\u2019t expect us to coordinate schedules with people we don\u2019t know and have never met, just to record some god-awful zoom presentation. It isn\u2019t helpful or related to our course and it just makes us all frustrated. \n\nLast semester a girl from one of my groups went totally MIA. We were so worried something terrible had happened. We eventually brought it up to our prof that this student had suddenly stopped responding and participating. Didn\u2019t want to throw her under the bus but we had no idea what happened. Turns out she just got overwhelmed and decided to ignore school for a couple of weeks. \n\nYou sound like one of the good ones, though. Thanks for reaching out like this!",

Zoom lecture learning is nearly impossible for me, and our lectures are almost 4 hours straight with no break. It\u2019s hard enough to maintain focus in an actual classroom, but this is somehow 10x worse. There should be several short breaks along with more interactive stuff, maybe some kind of quiz game for points to help keep us engaged. My grades have plummeted since zoom lectures began, and I think everyone else\u2019s have too. The average grade on our first test was a 68. Maybe bring back that flexible grading option too lol",

They're both like, 4 hours long with a 15 minute break, and while I'm used to dealing with that in a classroom/lab setting, it's *rough* when you're at home. I've been trying to practice good discipline about this, and I mean, I'm generally good enough/take it seriously enough to get into a hard science grad program, but it's an uphill battle. And then I'm balancing all this with rotations that, because of COVID, mean I start my day at 6 AM in the morning, and end it at 8 at night, some days.\n\nCombine this with the fact that questions are clumsier to ask for a lot of folks, and with constant technical problems, you get long slow boring periods of \"where do I find that file?\" or \"my internet is not working, can you hear me professor?\" and \"I'm getting an error message\" interspersed by the professor looking at the clock, and then info-dumping at a breakneck pace during the end of the session, when everyone is mentally fatigued from staring at a screen for four hours and trying to keep focused.",

There are some courses that professors have very little control over (like intro classes), where the department basically forces everyone to use the same books/software.

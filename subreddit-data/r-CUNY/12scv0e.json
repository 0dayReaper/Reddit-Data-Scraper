    "postText": "I'm reaching out to ask for your advice regarding a matter related to the availability of CSC 111 class at BMCC. Unfortunately, the only 1 available CSC 111 class for the upcoming Summer 2023 semester is already filled up, and I was unable to register for it. As CSC 111 is a major prerequisite for many other CSC classes, it is not possible for me to take other classes in the fall semester without having taken CSC 111 first.\n\nI'm wondering if it is possible to ask the BMCC CIS department to open another section of CSC 111 for the summer semester. I understand that this may require additional resources and efforts from the department, but as many students require this class to continue with their studies in the fall, an additional section may benefit many students.\n\nIf any of you have any experience with requesting additional sections for classes at BMCC or have any suggestions on how to communicate our need for another CSC 111 class to the BMCC CIS department, I would greatly appreciate your insights.",

You need to see what other CUNY schools offer the equivalent to this BMCC course if there is an equivalent you can apply for the e-permit. BMCC will approve or deny your request if it\u2019s approved you then wait for the school you\u2019re trying to take the equivalent course at to contact you with a registration date to enroll in the course.",

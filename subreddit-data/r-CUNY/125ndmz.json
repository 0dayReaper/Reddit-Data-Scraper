This does mean that some choices of major and courses are limited, but students tend to finish and graduate with a high rate of success, and without burning through their financial aid. \n\nIt\u2019s somewhat new, still, so doesn\u2019t have a wide reputation, but does have a pretty good record of getting students jobs (at least in the NYC area). \n\nThe location is great\u2014very easy for any subway\u2014but the buildings are only temporarily rented and crowding tends to be a problem. One day they will have their own building in a new location, but that\u2019s a long way off. \n\nLaGuardia or BMCC are going to give you more different options of majors, and also many good professors, but they are definitely a lot bigger and you might feel a bit lost and more on your own in terms of guidance and advisement. Guttman is smaller and more hands-on in terms of guiding you through what you need to do.",

Just wondering if it\u2019s overall a good school and I\u2019m gonna have a good time there. Also going there for science as rad tech.",

They\u2019re not like the traditional college they\u2019re more rigid, with a structured class schedule. They are mostly for students coming straight out of high school unlike other CUNY schools  where it\u2019s for everyone at any stage of life mostly. I did a tour before it\u2019s very small. I went to BMCC and Guttman is  way smaller than there. By Manhattan tech if you mean city tech downtown Brooklyn than it\u2019s way smaller than there as well I took college now classes in city tech before. Or are you talking about Manhattan Area Technical college ? A non-cuny? I think if you\u2019re want that campus feeling BMCC is a good place for it. If you want that small close knit community vibe maybe guttman will  be for you. My professors at BMCC were really nice but I guess it does depend on what your major will be. City Tech also has a radiology tech program i believe if that\u2019s something  you\u2019re interested in. I can\u2019t speak for LaGuardia but if you want to do a 2 year school and bmcc has what you\u2019re looking for I recommend there if it doesn\u2019t matter than I say city tech so your an easily get your bachelors.",

I don\u2019t really mind the smallness of it I\u2019m pretty shy so I think that\u2019ll help me. Just wondering what do you mean by a more structured class schedule?",

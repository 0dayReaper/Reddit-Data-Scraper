    "postText": "So about 3 weeks ago, I went back to campus to pick up my cap and gown. I was given a slip of paper to write my full name, college, cunyfirst number, and my height for the cap and gown. I was told to sit in the auditorium with other students who were there to get the yearbook. After I showed the lady the slip of paper who was handing out the yearbook, she gave back the paper and the yearbook. However, she said to me to give the slip of paper to the guy who was giving out the cap and gown. I walked towards the guy and gave the paper. The guy had put the slip of paper inside the plastic bag containing my cap and gown. I honestly thought everything was good and I left. I have a bad habit of doing things at the last minute. I am just now looking at the information and instructions for tomorrow graduation ceremony and it said: \u201cPlease bring your BMCC ID and these instructions when you pick up your cap and gown. Upon receipt of your cap and gown, you will be given a name card. Please save the name card, complete it and bring it with you to Commencement\u201d. So the question is what is a name card? I must of missed that part. Am I screwed now that I don\u2019t have a name card? I am panicking now and didn\u2019t check until the last minute.",

Not a bad idea to bring a pen, although they likely will have little pencils, too. At least they always used to. \n\nHave fun tomorrow and remember to smile. Congratulations!",

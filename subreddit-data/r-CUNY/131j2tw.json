I thought I might as well go and learn what I can until the very last day, but I don\u2019t want to risk not being able to withdraw and getting an F. \n\nWhen do you guys decide to withdraw and has there ever been any issues?",

Other than that, it's an option I think students should utilize more often if they need to.  Make sure you talk to your professor as well to garner their feedback.",

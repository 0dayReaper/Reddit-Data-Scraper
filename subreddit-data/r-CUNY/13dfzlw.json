(and in most cases in NY, the TAP as well). if you or your parents don't make much, you'll probably get a Pell or TAP grant, which does not have to be paid back, where a loan does have to be paid back.",

            "comment": "So for FAFSA, it's used by colleges, universities, and other educational institutions to determine the amount of financial aid a student may receive. The information provided on the FAFSA is used to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (the EFC), which is the amount the student and their family are expected to contribute towards their education costs. The FAFSA is typically required annually for students seeking financial aid. The Federal Grant Program refers to the various grants provided by the U.S. federal government to help students fund their education. Grants are a type of financial aid that does not need to be repaid, making them highly desirable. Examples could be pell grants, FSEOG's, etc",

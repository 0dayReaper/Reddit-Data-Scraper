    "postText": "I got a transfer pathway option to Georgia Tech but I need at least a 3.3 GPA overall and in math/science courses so I am planning to go to CUNY for my freshman year to save money. I was wondering which of these CUNY's are decent for computer science and would be the easiest to get at least a 3.3 in. Also, I need 30 credits by June 1, 2024, so being able to have a flexible schedule would be nice.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12b7bd4)",

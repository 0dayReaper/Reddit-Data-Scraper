But I have received no email regarding this and it is not in my to-do list. Does this mean I do not have to send it to them or maybe they forgot?",

The exact date must be provided on the documentation.",

I personally recommend that even if it isn\u2019t required you get the vaccine since meningitis is one of those viruses that regularly tears through schools and especially sports teams. It\u2019s also possible the email went to your spam folder, or that you\u2019ve already sent them your immunization records and you\u2019ve had the immunization already so they didn\u2019t send you the email.",

            "comment": "Yes, in  fact an e-permit course taken at a host college  has to be equivalent to a course at your home college in order to get approved. You wouldn\u2019t be able to take a course with no equivalency. You need to apply for the e-permit on cuny first. Whether you\u2019re applying for an e- permit course for summer , fall, spring , winter it needs to be equivalent to a course at your current school.  I believe applications for e-permit for summer is open so definitely do that asap they tend to take some time and it\u2019s always best to apply as some as it opens. You can easily check your school calendar to see if e-permits for summer open and do it asap.",

I\u2019ve taken a e-permit course for a course not being offered in that specific semester for my major  at another school that had an equivalent course but as far as taking a  course at another Cuny that\u2019s not needed for your major but you find interesting if that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying I don\u2019t know. You can email your school registrar office to ask since they are the ones who approves e-permits.",

Again, such rules are very program specific, so, if you think that might apply to your major/program, then check with them.

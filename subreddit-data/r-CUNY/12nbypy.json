In Baruch, for language courses you need to have camera on and constant participation is mandatory to pass. Way too intense for a degree requirement so I said f*ck all that and jumped ship to BMCC for Span II, best decision I ever made never even met the professor or spoke to a single student.\n\nBe mindful that your major requirement courses usually have an in-house requirement of a certain %. In Baruch you have to take atleast 15 credits in house for courses that are for your major. If you don't, you can't graduate.",

So long as the course you are taking is equivalent to one needed for your degree then you are fine. You can check course equivalent classes on CUNYfirst. You input the class required for your degree and it will give you a list of other schools and the class eligible for epermit. Just make sure to check if theres any pre reqs required at the other school (don\u2019t apply for a psychology class that requires a specific psych 1100 you never took).",

The grade and credits will transfer over at the end of the semester. Financial aid would cover it as well because its counted in your cumulative semester credits.\n\nYou could take the class at bmcc without the epermit and then have them send the official transcript to have the credits transferred over, but the grade won't, just the credits would transfer over. You would have to either declare a second major at bmcc just to take the class or go as a non matriculated student.  Probably better to declare a second major if you go this route.  \n\nE-permit is your best bet if FA is a consideration and you want your grade to count towards your GPA.",

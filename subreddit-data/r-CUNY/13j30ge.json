    "postText": "For background I\u2019m a freshman, in my second semester now, and a psychology major. Applied Statistics is a mandatory course for my major. I currently have a 62% in the class. I feel like dropping it because I have a strong sense that I will not pass the final exam. I\u2019ve done poorly on the tests, and my homework grades aren\u2019t helping either. I feel like in order to pass this class I would need a B or an A in the final exam, which I strongly believe isn\u2019t possible for me because the course material is very challenging for me. I plan on talking to an advisor today, but I just want other people\u2019s opinions. What would you do in this situation? Would it be best to drop it or keep it?",

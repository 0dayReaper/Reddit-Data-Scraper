            "comment": "If you get told you need remediation, make sure you take what is called a corequisite remedial course, not a prerequisite remedial course. With the former you take a college-level class but get extra help, and with the latter you take a course that is considered a precollege course that gives you no college credit and that either you or your financial aid has to pay for. Research has shown that students are most likely to pass and graduate when they take corequisite instead of prerequisite remedial courses. Also, if what we're talking about is math (as opposed to reading or writing), if you don't need algebra for your major, be sure to take statistics instead of algebra. Students who take statistics have higher pass rates and generally report more enjoyment of the course than if they take algebra.",

    "postText": "Hi, I got accepted as a transfer in both brooklyn and hunter college, but i'm contemplating on which to go. I'm majoring in biology, and i heard that brooklyn college mostly focuses on pre med and isn't as well funded as hunter. Also when i looked at transfer explorer to see how my credits will transfer, hunter took some of my major courses (like general bio) as an elective which is why i'm not so sure. I just want to hear from others to see what both are like",

Hunter science lectures are jam-packed (hundreds) and getting the course may be an issue because of numbers. For sciences, it's a very hands off approach where students teach themselves using PowerPoint, KhanAcademy, Crash course and study groups. Hunter is not the \"best,\" it's the most intense CUNY school, where they require more courses to fulfill requirements. Ex: we had to take 4 language semesters where in other CUNYs, students only need 2. I think it's their attempt at rivalling with elite schools like Columbia and NYU. I've heard that Hunter is the Ivy League of CUNY schools. What I gained from Hunter were lifelong friends, the clubs were interesting, and the social events were enjoyable. Good luck.",

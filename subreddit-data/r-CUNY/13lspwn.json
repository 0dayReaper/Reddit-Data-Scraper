Due to a processing error on CUNY's end, my application status *just* updated to all my transcripts showing as Received/Evaluated and Final Transcript Received yesterday. \n\nWhat do I need to do next? Just wait on the schools I applied to to reply with an acceptance letter/email?  Or do I need to be proactive and reach out to someone at those schools to push this along since my application got completed so late?",

Early admissions already went out but many places still process people weeks before orientation. It does suck because class selection might not be as great depending on the school but thats about it.",

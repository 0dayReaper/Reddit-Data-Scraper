    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nWondering if I should be worried about something not showing up on Blackboard/CUNYFirst\n\nI took 6 classes this semester. Five of them were at my home college (Brooklyn College) while one of them was on an e-permit at another CUNY campus (BMCC).\n\nYesterday was my last session of the class I am taking at BMCC. I've had access to the class on Blackboard all semester to view lectures and submit assignments. Upon logging in this morning to see the grade for my final project, the class was no longer there, which I thought was weird. So my paranoid self also went to check the Schedule Builder on CUNYFirst and checked Spring 2023 and it shows me registered only for five classes as opposed to 6. At this point I email my professor and tell her that I've lost access. She tells me that everything is good on her end and that I aced the final project and got an A in the class.\n\nMy question to the good people of this sub-reddit is, should I be worried that it isn't appearing on CUNY First? Or is this something that happens while the class/grade is transferred to the home college's equivalent course section in degreeworks? And if this IS something I should be worried about, who do I email/call to get things sorted out?\n\nThank you in advance for any help you guys offer me.\n\n\\-first time e-permit/paranoid CUNY student",

Cunyfirst DID update last night though.. Maybe that's why? I would wait until tomorrow to see if it's still gone, then contact someone else, not sure who though.",

    "postText": "I previously attended BMCC for my freshman semester. In that time my financial aid came to me in the form of checks that were titled refunds. Like the broke and eager 18-year-old I was I pocketed that money as I assumed it was residual money from my finical aid. I was wrong so by the time I had transferred to Baruch College I had amassed  $5,000 in unpaid tuition. Some time went by and I was informed that if did not pay at a certain date my account would be moved to a collection agency and would negatively affect credit if I did not pay. In a panic I called the BMCC bursar offices, and they told me that the minimum payment I could make each month is $100 to each account. This would keep the payment within BMCC. \n\nBefore that I decided to transfer to Hunter and am currently in the process of enrolling for classes for the 2023 Fall semester. After I paid my tuition to Baruch, I am still left with two *In House Collection* holds. Since all CUNYs use the same system, that being CUNY FIRST, this prevents me from enrolling in classes.  Is there any way involving not immediately paying the entirety of my due tuition to get them to remove this hold on my account? Has anybody had a similar experience (to help me feel less like a dunce)? Any advice in general would be greatly appreciated!",

    "postText": "I was placed in International House for a summer program and I have been placed in a room with a sink, with no access to a kitchen or refrigerator. Has anyone else lived in this arrangement? What did you typically eat/how did you fare with no leftovers? I have $6.50 to spend in the dining hall every day.",

I'd use microwave on my floor's lounge and kept an induction cooker in my room for some light duty cooking. Mostly I learned to survive on salads and used that 6.5$ credit to get breakfast and coffee at the dining room lol",

I\u2019m thinking of looking for someone selling a refrigerator up there so I can at least keep leftovers in my room. Have you had any experience buying furniture from other students in I-House?",

There are so many whatsapp groups that people are always selling stuff there so that's very convinient, I got a mini refrigerator through those groups lol. But do check with Bursar's office -- they might provide you with  a mini fridge if it's available.  I am most likely moving to i-house as well in next fall if I don't get into housing at CUNY. Are you a graduate student?))",

That means it won\u2019t be too bad without the kitchen, but I still wish I would have known ahead of time. I know next time to ask. I did call them up and they said that they wouldn\u2019t provide anything, so I\u2019ll have to contact other students when I get up there. How did you find the WhatsApp groups?",

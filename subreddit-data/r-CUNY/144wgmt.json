I was at SPS but left because I was at the halfway mark with my credits for an Associates. KCC took the max allowed. I got credit for a lot of the core. It's crazy because CUNY changes their core over time. Example I had to take a writing intensive and another English class which wasn't required before because of the students coming in that don't read or write at a college level. That's why I made the decision to do the Associates and go back and do my Bachelors.",

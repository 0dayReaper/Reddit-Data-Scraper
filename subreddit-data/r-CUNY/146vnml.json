    "postText": "Hello guys,\nI am a student in an Advanced Certificate Graduate Program at Hunter College.\nThe program started two weeks ago and I missed the first three lectures (for medical reasons, pregnant diagnosed with threatened miscarriage, had appointments and couldn\u2019t go out on Wednesday du to the heavy smog). \nNow I emailed the Professor letting him know why I missed the lectures. Few hours later I received an email from bursar letting me know I was dropped from the class for non-attendance (WN grade). \nThis would mean that I most likely won\u2019t be able to be in the program anymore as the class is needed to be eligible for the next step (10months clinical rotation). \nI contacted the professor and didn\u2019t get any answers so far. \nThe program director told me they don\u2019t know what the procedure would be since this never happened before.\nI would like to know if there is any way to reverse the WN grade. This is stressing me out and it hurts because it\u2019s definitely not my fault. \nAny help is appreciated!",

I did email registrar/bursar. \nThe professor and program are really nice and let me attend while we sort things out.\nGlad things worked out for you. It\u2019s ridiculous they give you WN grade for being late smh \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

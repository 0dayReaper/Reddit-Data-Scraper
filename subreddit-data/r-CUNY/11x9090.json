    "postText": "I understand they want B and up to get into their program, but why can\u2019t students repeat a pre req class if they got a poor grade? Like what is the reason for that? Doesn\u2019t it demonstrate they aren\u2019t afraid to fail and try again until they get it correct? And if they earn a better grade that means they learned the material, right? Plus wouldn\u2019t cuny make more money with students paying to take classes multiple times?? (Let\u2019s be real we know cuny loves our money) \n\nBtw I\u2019m not even a nursing major, but I took Chem for my science requirement (barely scraped by with an A-) &amp; saw so many of my friends drop out of Hunter entirely bc they didn\u2019t get a B..my heart broke for them. Especially with the nurse shortage, this just seems so counterintuitive, not student focused, and honestly not beneficial for anyone. \n\nTLDR: why can\u2019t nurse students at Hunter retake prerequisites if they got below a B?",

            "comment": "It's because they only want the smartest of the smartest to make it into the program. GPA is actually the most important factor to determine your acceptance (other than the pax score) because nursing school is very tough. Given that Hunter designed the prereqs to be difficult, if too many students are given A's, then it would seem that the school is too easy and that there's no competition for the program. If the prereqs are difficult, then it drives the competition to get that A that not everyone will get. When the program sees that you get good grades from the prereqs, they will accept you because they think that you might also do well in the tough nursing courses. Thus, the competitive nature is general with most nursing programs on the GPA aspect. If you think about it, retaking the prereqs will only make the program more competitive than it already was.",

If you can not even pass your prereqs with a B, how are you expected to pass your nursing classes + clinical? In the end, you need to take the NCLEX-RN to be licensed as a nurse. If you're not a good test taker in your prereqs, I would be cautious. Hunter needs to have these protocols in place to filter the best applicants.",

I think my gripe here is with academia overall, not specifically Hunter. Their nursing program is great so if this process has been working I guess I understand why they wouldn\u2019t want to revise it. I do find it a bit awkward how Hunter prides itself on being so inclusive and diverse, yet tests everyone as if they are all at an even playing field for passing prerequisite exams\u2026 not sure I have a better suggestion or that Im knowledgeable enough on the topic anyways tho, this is just my insight..",

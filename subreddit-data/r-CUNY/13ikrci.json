I could've dealt with anything else, frog, rat, whatever but cat, absolutely not. If that's something you're not cool with, then look into it to see if they still do it.",

The staff is not supportive whatsoever, we only have one lecture each week to go over about 2-3 chapters, and our graduation rate is 47%. We were a class of over 60 and about 15 people have dropped already. I do think its because the head of the nursing program stepped down last year so the new head is trying new things. On the other hand, I hear BMCC is much better and their graduation rate is about 70-80% (based on the stats I saw on their page). Im actually considering on transferring even though I know I\u2019ll have to go over the candidacy process again :,)",

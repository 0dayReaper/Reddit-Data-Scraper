    "postText": "Hi everyone!! Recently, my laptop broke, and I can't really buy a new one right now. I heard there are some programs in CUNY that you can participate in to get a free laptop to keep. I know the honors program and Macaulay gives away free laptops, but it's too late for that now (lol). Do any of you know any programs I can participate in for a free laptop? Thank You!!",

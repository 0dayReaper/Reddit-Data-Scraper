Since most/all cunys are commuter schools there isn't much opportunity for social interaction or the chance to make friends/connections so I wanted to make this post to offer a space for that. If you are a cuny student or if you are pursuing the same major as me feel free to respond to this post or message me on instagram @ cmonmel ! I'm always looking to meet new people and make friends :)",

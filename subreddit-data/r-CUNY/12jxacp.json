    "postText": "I saw recently that towards the Fall of 2024 CUNY\u2019s will begin to use Brightspace instead of Blackboard. I don\u2019t know exactly what that means. Is it for the better or worse? I enjoyed Blackboard and don\u2019t understand the issues everyone has with it. Will Brightspace have a better layout? More security for Professors to eliminate cheating? I\u2019m so confused why is there a change when everything was fine.",

Brightspace doesn't support the same anti-cheating plug-ins as Blackboard, and it doesn't support some quiz and question types that are available in Blavkboard. \n\nBut the Blackboard contract was ending and it went out to bid and these guys won the new contract.",

I'm sure Brightspace has something, but don't know what it is. \n\nChat GPT is going to make a lot of these old cheat detectors worthless anyway. We'll see what the next development is.",

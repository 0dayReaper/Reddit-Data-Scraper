    "postText": "I applied for both Brooklyn College and Laguradia community college as a backup. I got into Brooklyn College and accepted the offer as soon as I got it. I also got into Laguardia but I didn't accept the offer of admission. I also didn't reject the offer and I kinda just let it be in the view application status menu. Recently, I received an email from Laguardia thanking me for accepting their offer of admission which I did not do. So, what am I supposed to do now and what does this mean?",

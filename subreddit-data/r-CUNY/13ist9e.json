    "postText": "Hi! I am an Excelsior Scholarship and TAP recipient. This fall, I am taking 9 credits at my home college (CCNY) and 6 e-Permit credits -- one of the classes is for my major, the other is an elective. I am on track to graduate in 4 years and complete 30 credits / year. My advisor approved of my plan.\n\nDoes anyone know how taking less than 12 credits at the home college will impact my financial aid timeline? Will there be a hold on my account, or will Financial Aid wait for my e-Permit credits to be accepted and processed? Do I have to do anything extra like reach out to the Registrar or HESC?\n\nThank you!!!",

    "postText": "Hello all. For this summer, I wish to re-enroll for a math class, Pre-Calc, in where I did not satisfy the first time I took it. I am familiar with most of the topics, but honestly failed in executing it all for the final. \n\nOne math class is going on for eight weeks and the other for three, later in the summer. \n\nHas anyone experienced such classes or circumstance? Is it too much for three weeks?",

In order words, use RMP to help avoid tough graders. \n\nA professor can make or break a class.",

    "postText": "Hi, i already graduated with a Bachelor in Biological Science in May. However i want to apply for the ABSN (accelerates bachelor of science in nursing program). It seem that I still need to take one microbiology course in order to fulfill the required pre-reqs that I needed. I was going to apply as a non-degree student since I only need one credit.\n\nThe problem is that the cunyfirst global searching website does not contain any microbiology class. Therefore I would like to ask if anyone knows any community college in New York or any cuny school offer microbiology class in summer (Preferably  school that is in Manhattan or Queens)\n\nThank you so much",

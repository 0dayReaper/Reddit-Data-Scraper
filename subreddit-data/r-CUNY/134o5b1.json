I didn\u2019t know many people who were in the Weissman School of Arts and Sciences because there were more students from the Zicklin School of Business. From what I\u2019ve heard and read, Baruch is a better school overall compared to Hunter and I would only choose Hunter over Baruch if you\u2019re a science major. And hey, if you don\u2019t like Baruch or it doesn\u2019t suit your needs (no pun intended) then CUNY makes it really easy for you to transfer between schools. I had many friends who did just that.",

There\u2019s tons of clubs and organizations at both campuses, although obviously Baruch has more of a business focus even in that area. For academics, I would go with hunter for anything life sciences or humanities. Creative writing is one of the best in the entire country at the MFA level, the undergrad degree is just a BA with a creative writing focus but I assume it\u2019s all the same profs from the same department? Worth looking into! Good luck deciding today if you haven\u2019t already.",

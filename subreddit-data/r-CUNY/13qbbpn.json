    "postText": "I am a graduate studentand this professor has literally changed my life! Not only does she teach undergraduate courses, she is the head of a master\u2019s program as well. She has pushed me to apply for jobs I didn\u2019t think I would get and she also helped me through awards applications (I won three)! She\u2019s more than just a professor\u2026 she\u2019s a mentor and I owe a lot of my successes in the past year to her! She\u2019s dedicated her life to teaching and I think she deserves a little vacation (a free one!) \n\nPlease click this link to vote for her. You\u2019ll need to confirm in your email after. Any votes would be much appreciated!! \n\nhttps://contest.nclgivingjoy.com/voteme/954984/687452492?lc=eng",

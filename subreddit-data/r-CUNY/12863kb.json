            "comment": "Good question. I\u2019m currently a freshman at baruch and I\u2019ll probably be transitioning into the CS major. Now we have a really good math department at Baruch which the CS major will be apart of. We have math professors that teach the MFE program which is the #1 program in the country, some of these professors teach undergrad courses as well so you\u2019ll be in good hands. There are only 2 pros I can think of rn as to choosing CS at Baruch over CCNY. The first being that the CS major allows you to have concentrations such as in bioinformatics (more concentrations will come soon). Some professors at Baruch have stated that pursuing a concentration will be helpful in their research work. This is something which you can put on your resume which looks great and it\u2019s a big plus if you ever want to go to grad school. The first batch of CS students have a really a good chance to get a research opportunity. The second pro being that if you ever want to get into quant finance such as being a quant dev, Baruch will be better than CCNY. These are the only 2 pros I can think of. CCNY has a better developed CS program and better connections for anything engineering related but I heard it\u2019s very rigorous, not to say that baruch CS won\u2019t also be rigorous because you need a 3.5 gpa between calc 1 and 2, a B in discrete math, and a B in an intro level programming course.",

So being from Baruch which is popular for finance really doesn't set you apart from any other CS major. \n\nEvery employer looks at CUNYs all the same, there is no best CUNY.",

I believe that for CS hunter is a great choice because it has a variety of classes. I went to 3 cunys, graduated in CS, work for Amazon (IT Field, although not in a coding job, I realized I hate coding too late), and \"old and packed\" can describe every cuny. Only Queens college tries with aesthetics, and even they have some buildings which are trash.",

If you want to do CS for a business company, Baruch might be good. If you also want a place where you want backups in case you don't enjoy CS, Baruch is great. City should be chosen if you're insanely committed to coding, CS, math, engineering. Also take into account how much of a commute each is, because commuting for college can be a massive drag. I had to commute 40 min one way for my first cuny and that was a brutal experience.",

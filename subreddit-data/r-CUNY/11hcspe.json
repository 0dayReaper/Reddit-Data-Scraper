    "postText": "Got accepted into BMCC which was basically my only good college choice after I started my senior year with a 1.3 GPA as a result of horrible procrastination and untreated mental issues and I have a few questions. How do I maintain a minimum 3.8 GPA? How do I make friends and connections while at BMCC? How do I ensure everything I am working towards will successfully transfer over? How do I make sure I stand out to the people accepting transfer offers? Lastly, should I transfer after my first or second year?",

            "comment": "Currently at BMCC as well and I plan to transfer to Columbia once it\u2019s time. I have a 3.8 GPA and am trying to be as involved in the community as much as I can. I was in the same boat as I had really bad grades in HS and so wanted to go to community college to get better stats for a senior college to look at. Best things you can do you to maintain a high GPA is straight forward for the most part. Attend all your classes, read the syllabus so you know what\u2019s expected of you and required, complete every single assignment to the best of your ability and aim for a 85-100 grade on each of them. The difficulty of these will depend on your major and how invested you are in it. Make connections with your professors. Join a club! There\u2019s so many at BMCC. In college you have a co-curricular transcript and that\u2019s for everything you do outside of your academic classes. Senior colleges look at this and depending on what you have on there, it will make your application look better. Clubs are a great way to become more involved on campus, make friends, and form connections with people. Try to join a success program if you can; ASAP or Out-in-Two. Out in two is a great one specifically. It\u2019s a program that focuses on you graduating within 2 years. They give you an 1800 scholarship each semester, an advisor, and you\u2019re already part of this group that\u2019s also in the same program. This would also go on the co-curricular transcript. If you don\u2019t want the senior college to look at your high school transcript, you need to transfer with at least 30 credits, after a year. But it\u2019s recommended to transfer after two simply for the easier process.",

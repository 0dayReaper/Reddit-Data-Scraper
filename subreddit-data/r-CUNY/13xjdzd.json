            "comment": "Did you submit a university transcript? If you have at least 30 credits (or the equivalent - basically a full year at an accredited institution of higher education), you don\u2019t need your high school record for any CUNY school, but some schools have a lower threshold. The CUNY representatives and transcript evaluators are not all equally informed on this. Several argued with me and I offered to send them back their own materials showing it was true. You may have to push them on this so they\u2019ll actually release your application to LaGuardia if everything else has been received and evaluated.\n\nWired_Head1955\u2019s advice is true in the general case. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. If you can get this, the process with the central CUNY office may go smoother for you. It looks like LaGuardia only requires proof of high school completion for transfers: https://laguardia.catalog.cuny.edu/admission-tuition-and-financial-aid/overview. The catalog says as an international applicant you can submit your application and documents directly to LaGuardia and unofficial copies of secondary school documents are fine. Honestly, I\u2019d recommend doing that unless you want to spend time arguing with CUNY.",

It\u2019s just submitting your transcript in the system and they\u2019ll review it. If it\u2019s in a foreign language (like mine) you have to send it for translation and that same place has to notarize your document. And then submit both your original transcript and the translated-notarized transcript and that\u2019s about it.",

I\u2019m thinking of going back for a graduate degree, and I\u2019m curious about what the process looks like. I\u2019m thinking of going back for a degree in education. What would be the requirements to get into the program? My GPA was a 2.6, due to some rougher early semesters. Would I be able to take some prerequisites courses to improve my chances of being accepted?",

I\u2019ve used the transfer tool on degreeworks and for 2 other cunys (Hunter is one of them) it says that a little more than half my credits will transfer over. I\u2019ve taken very little elective classes, mostly core business courses that correspond with my degree.\n\nHow accurate is this? Am I doomed?\n\nAny advice or help? Thank you.",

I believe what they have up there is what was supposed to be true (but was often not followed) prior to June 2011 when the CUNY Board of Trustees passed a new policy (which I authorized as CUNY's Executive Vice Chancellor and University Provost, a position I held from 2008-2014). According to the policy in effect since June 2011 (when this policy was passed by the CUNY-wide Board of Trustees, which means it applies to every CUNY college), each course gets considered for transfer individually, independent of anything else a student has taken or any degree the student has (there are a few cases where a student has to take 2 courses to get a certain type of transfer credit). So, e.g., if you take Bio 100 at a community college, you will get the same credit for it if you stay only 1 year at that college or stay until getting your associate's. And this applies to every course, including general education courses. The only advantage in terms of credits by having an associate's is that you only have to do 6 more credits of general education courses after transferring to a bachelor's program instead of 9-12 credits otherwise (my team also instituted the Pathways gen ed structure). But there is is no effect of having an associate's on how the credits for any course you've already taken will transfer. We did the policy this way because we wanted students to have a choice--to be able to transfer before the associate's if they wanted to, or had to for some personal reason, and not have there be any harm done to the credits the student had already accumulated. It may be that NYCCT is guaranteeing to its associate's-bearing AA/AS transfer students that they won't have to do more than 60 credits (I certainly hope so if this is on their website, but it may just be left from pre2011), but that is most definitely not a policy at most CUNY colleges (perhaps any), and take a look at that phrase starting \"however...\" What that phrase is really saying is we'd like to say you'll only need 60 more credits, but if you come in without the proper prerequisites that may not be possible.  Like every other CUNY college, NYCCT has transfer rules for every course coming in from anywhere at CUNY on [Transfer Explorer](https://explorer.cuny.edu/) (a tool that my group created in 2020 and has now had almost 100,000 unique users), and those rules do not differ depending on what else a student has taken or degrees the student has. Please take a look if you haven't already.",

            "comment": "General credits will transfer (English 101, history 101, etc..) You must keep in mind the requirement that you complete at least 30 credits in the new school. With the majority of them being in your major. I thought it was 25 but another poster mentioned 27. \n\nI had some credits that did not transfer over until I submitted appeals with the departments and submitted syllabi to demonstrate they\u2019re the same class. \n\nAnother technique is to see what the credits transfer like to one school and then see how they transfer to your target school. Yes it\u2019s annoying to do but saves you money and time. I discovered that my queens college class transferred over to all other CUNYs as a comparative literature course. Except at Baruch who wanted it to count as a Spanish elective. But if I transferred from the other CUNYs then Baruch would count it as a comparative literature course. I know, it sounds dumb but these errors happen, and once I showed them this, they rectified it and gave me the credit.",

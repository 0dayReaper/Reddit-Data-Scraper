    "postText": "Hey, guys hope you are all doing well. I'm getting increasingly concerned with the Omicron variant and how nothing is being done in CUNY Admin to do anything about it. Like Cornell yesterday had so many cases, how is that CUNY being commuter schools and also densely packed together don't have a volume of cases? Something tells me that they are being quiet about the numbers tbh because they don't care about us. I think more online classes should be given out for the Spring Semester, but I know that even if we do go online, we will be the few last universities to do it because public schools always wait until students are massively getting sick. Do you guys think we should or will go online more for the Spring Semester? Bc my school, in particular, wants to fully open back up in the Spring. I feel like many of us as CUNY students, don't have the courage to fight bc we kind of expect this, but we shouldn't stand for this at all. If we don't rise up and form a union, the admin will continue to do this. I'm talking let's form a strategy and do something, use social media or shit.",

Of course, if they tested more, they'd get more positives \u2014 but the numbers are still dramatically low.\n\nEdit: Also, from August 25th (the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester) to December 12th, out of the 87,016 people tested on CUNY sites, only 217 have been positive (0.20%.)\n\nWe might soon have an uptick, who knows. When that happens, I'm sure precautions will be taken, and we will see a shift to online learning. But as of right now, let's not got conspiratorial when we have the data in front of us.",

CUNY also pushed back the deadline for students to get vaccinated again and again in fears that they wouldn\u2019t get their money.  4,220 tests per week is a sign CUNY needs to test way more than they are right now imo. Lastly I don\u2019t trust that they are going to take the proper precautions tbh cuz they are going to make the decision that is the best financially sound.

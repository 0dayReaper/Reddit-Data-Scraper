    "postText": "I have to vent. I have a love-hate relationship with CUNY, mostly hate. CUNY advertises itself as flexible and affordable for working people, but it is anything but that, especially their 4-year colleges. Graduating as a working person feels impossible due to their system. I only need 3 classes, yet I am trapped in their bureaucratic maze. I'm even contemplating dropping out at this point. Two of the classes I need have conflicting schedules: one from 1:40 PM to 5 PM and the other from 10 AM to 1 PM. I inquired about online, weekend, or evening options, but they said no. One of the classes has two sections with available slots, and the other could potentially be moved to a Saturday morning instead of Friday afternoon. I'm incredibly frustrated, but with the current economy, I can't simply quit my job.",

At this point i am just going to take one class. One of the classes is design 3 which has 3 sections all around the same time during the week.  And one section is being taught by the department head. There is design 1 and 2 which i have taken in the past and they have more offerings for those classes and online and weekend option. .  The other class is my senior capstone and it that class one section is full and that other ones are not even half capacity which makes no sense why is that class not online.",

Overtally you into the capstone or substitute it with independent studies.

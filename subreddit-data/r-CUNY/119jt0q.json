    "postText": "Hi, I need to submit documents because I was accepted for SEEK at a CUNY school. I have my FAFSA ready but they need things such as the following: 2021 IRS Tax Return Transcript or 1040 Tax Return, 2021 Social Security Statement, 2021 Veteran Benefit Award Letter, 2021 Supplemental Security Income (SSI), 2021 Public Assistance Budget Letter, and 2021 Verification of Non-filing Letter. I have no clue what half this stuff is and every time I ask my parents for help they say \"I'll do it later\" or \"Ask (other parent)\" If it hasn't been made obvious they fucking hate each other and won't get my documents together needed for SEEK. CUNYfirst says the last day for verification is 2/24 but it also says it is due in 4 weeks which is 3/6 which confuses me, but I want to get it done by 2/24 just in case which is in two days. About an hour ago I stated attempting to get the \"budget letter\" but it says out \"case needs to be active to get one\" and I don't know what that case is or how to activate it. I told my mother and she told me to ask my dad because he has everything. I asked him and he said my mom has it in her name. I said she told me that he could still access it. After that he simply told me \"fuck you you stupid son of a bitch.\" Pleasant. He's left me on delivered ever since. All my mom did was laugh at me when I expressed my frustration and started whining about how he's such a horrible person and how \"you should become successful and rich so we can live better\" when she won't even help with getting me into the school to start the damn process of \"becoming rich\". I don't know what to do now. With the date looming so close I feel doomed. I tried calling the SEEK center at my CUNY but they didn't answer. Someone help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Did my SEEK interview some time ago and I should receive admission soon. Thank you all for the help!",

Can you get your dad or mom's social security number? Also do you know the hours of your SEEK office? You should keep calling, and if they still don't pick up contact your college's ombudsman. In fact, given the time constraint I would reach out in tandem. You're going to have to be diligent and persistent in contacting CUNY to get some real answers. \n\nIdk if this correct but from a quick google it seems like your mom (or you if you can get the information) can get a 2021 Tax Return Transcript by filling out a form. There are different versions of the form depending on the relationship to the filer, you'll have to check to see which one they will accept.\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/individuals/transcript-types-and-ways-to-order-them",

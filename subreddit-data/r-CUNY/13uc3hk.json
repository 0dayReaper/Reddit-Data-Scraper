    "postText": "So basically i got accepted for an internship through cuny launch but realized taking this internship would interfere with my summer classes severely, not because of the hours interfering with each other but the fact that I would be home rlly late due to how far the place is and I would have no time to study whatsoever for the class if I decide to take the position. I was planning on rejecting the position, but the commitment form has other questions after the \"do you confirm you position\" question such as do you understand the requirements and scheduling. So do i just fill in no for the rest of it? Or do I need to contact someone else bout this to reject the offer. Thanks in advance!",

I might have to fill out the form tho with all no's because they emailed a few days ago saying that we have until may 30th to fill out the form even though on inplace itself it says june 16th. Idk, i just don't want to risk any issues if I don't fill out the form since Idk the definite deadline for the form.",

Some students don\u2019t have to pay out of pocket because they or their families make below a certain amount each year and they receive grants from the federal and state governments. So what your saying essentially is that poor students don\u2019t deserve the same treatment as students that are able to go to other schools? \n\nThe poor working class is even more likely to contract Covid (living with multiple family members so they are unable to social distance, working at jobs that don\u2019t allow them to work from home, etc). I guess Covid is the price CUNY students should have to pay for being poor and wanting an education. If this is the case, CUNY should\u2019ve provided waivers that made sure to inform us we aren\u2019t entitled to any safety because some of us are \u201cpoor undesirables that go for free\u201d.",

As long as cuny gets their money from the fed/state, they arent gonna care about the majority of the students. Others who can afford it will pay for CUNY cause of the cost value. \n\nEven in a pandemic, majority of ppl won\u2019t delay college cause of 3k a semester, they\u2019ll risk a shitty semester especially when they\u2019ll get a refund.\n\nPrivate colleges make their money from people taking out loans to pay or paying out of pocket. Risk is a lot greater when people are personally paying 25k+ a semester. They won\u2019t want to risk having a bad semester due to learning/infrastructure issues so private colleges are more incentivized to do something and at least try to do it right. \n\nCUNY isn\u2019t a poor college system, it\u2019s a cheap college system, a public run/funded one at that. To expect the same level of quality as a private institution is foolish.",

This is a concern of CUNY. If students have to withdraw from classes because they are too sick to attend this is a huge problem in the long run.

Even if CUNY doesn't care, they'll start feeling some heat when their tuition based income starts decreasing. \n\nIf you were arguing on the quality of education, professors, or resources you would have a sound argument. I don't disagree in that regard. Your intial comment asserts that CUNY students shouldn't get online classes and other covid accommodations during a pandemic because CUNY is \"free\". The need for Covid accommodations isn't based how much students pay for tuition.",

This is a concern of CUNY.\n\nIf the past two year have shown us anything, they don\u2019t care unless there\u2019s pressure from the state. \nThey refused online classes for the longest until both city and state govt started disagreeing where private colleges acted nearly immediately. \n\n&gt;\tThey have to refund some of that grant money if students withdraw before a certain date so everyone loses. The same goes for students that are paying out of pocket or through loans as well. Even if CUNY doesn\u2019t care, they\u2019ll start feeling some heat when their tuition based income starts decreasing.\n\nThey still get paid. Whether it\u2019s grants or out of pocket, the refund schedule is the same. They keep 75% of the money after the first few weeks anyways, anyone on aid doesn\u2019t usually withdraw if they fall below full time status at the risk of less grant coverage and paying more out of pocket. It\u2019s cheaper to fail and replace the grade the following semester. It\u2019s very hard for cuny to lose money. \n\nExample:\nSpring semester starts on 1/28/22.\nLast day for 25% refund is 2/17/22 and 100% on 2/18/22. They keep practically all the money after two weeks when classes are still getting started and underway. \n\nThe system is set up so cuny doesn\u2019t lose. \n\nMy argument is cuny **doesn\u2019t have an incentive** to give proper Covid accommodations. They keep all your money after two weeks of classes and around 75% of their revenue is grant based. A portion of the remaining 25% paying out of pocket would risk 3k a semester to atleast pass classes than delay graduation. \n\n&gt;\tThe need for Covid accommodations isn\u2019t based how much students pay for tuition.\n\nUnfortunately it is. \nIt\u2019s not about logic or what\u2019s right or wrong for the students, in the end it\u2019s about profits which cuny doesn\u2019t lose.",

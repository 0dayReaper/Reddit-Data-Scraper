I\u2019m not even 100% sure if I want to transfer but I\u2019m considering LAGCC due to their use of sessions along with semesters since it might be faster and I just want to get school done as fast as I can. I will say, I don\u2019t see a lot of socialization at BMCC though, but I\u2019m also a shy person so that might be why.",

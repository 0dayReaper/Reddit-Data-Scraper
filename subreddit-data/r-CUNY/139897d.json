I saw a post that someone didn't apply to any CC and used the max 4 for all Senior Colleges and didn't get into any of the 4.  You will get into BMCC which is a great school so you have options. If you ever up going to BMCC you should consider completing the 2 years unless they don't have your major. Look through the threads about BMCC. I saw a T/T that someone said they should make it a 4 year.",

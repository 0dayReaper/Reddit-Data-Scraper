    "postText": "When you're a graduate student, especially in the sciences, the expectation is that you're paid for your work. You're working 40+ hour weeks, coming in on weekends, and generating the research that puts CUNY as an R1 school -- top tier in terms of scientific output. It's your full-time job, and then some.\n\nAcross all the sciences at CUNY, there are systematic problems with actually getting a paycheck. Graduate workers, the same ones who teach classes, or might mentor you for a research opportunity, often go weeks or months without getting a paycheck. They complain about it, take out predatory loans to buy food, or pay rent, are told \"oh, we're sorry for the mistake, we'll pay you next week\" and then when next week rolls around, they said \"whoops, that's gonna be another two weeks.\n\nUnlike Columbia, who is on strike, we're kinda not allowed to strike -- I think it has to do with being state employees, technically.\n\nThe salary for a grad student is far lower than the cost of living in NYC -- the base, most common amount is 30k/year. Imagine living on that, but then also you have to expect to go two months with no paycheck at all, because the funding system is broken and the bureaucracy is so entrenched that it's hard to even know who to contact.\n\nI know this subreddit is largely undergrads, but I wanted to post this just as sort of a testament to the shit that is going on at the Graduate Center. You sign a contract -- you get paid X amount of dollars for the year. And you work *hard.* \n\nAnd then...they just don't pay you. If any business did this, the labor board would destroy them. You'd have a lawsuit on your hands. But, hey, we're teaching classes anyway, even though many of us are not getting paid what we are owed. We go into work every day, publishing papers, mentoring students, and not getting paid. Sometimes, we even get sick, and go to the doctor only to find that, due to a bureaucratic oversight, we no longer have health coverage that we pay into with every paycheck.\n\nSomething's gotta give. It's really hard to be a PhD student when you are scared about how you are going to pay rent, because you haven't had a check for the job you do six or seven days a week, for weeks and weeks.",

My mentor takes really good care of everyone, and it is a vastly different experience than doing your PhD at another campus. I get paid very well, and on-time. If you want to do a PhD, do it at ASRC, because it's a world-class research institution, and the people there take care of you.\n\nBut I have a ton of colleagues at other colleges who miss paychecks for weeks and months. They are hardworking and insightful scientists, and deserve to get paid for their work in a timely fashion, as per the offer letter they signed.",

Also, there are are lot of labs at CUNY that do stellar work.\n\nMoreover, the grad students I know and collaborate with are pretty great scientists. The idea that CUNY GC is a safety school should go away -- it is thought of as a safety school precisely because of this mismanagement. If the GC wants to be competitive in getting bright young scientists on board, paying them in a good start. They have the money, and they have the PIs and the facilities -- in this way, it's a pretty damned good program if you are a biologist.\n\nWhat they do not have is an administration who cares at all about making sure their workforce is able to, like, buy food for dinner.",

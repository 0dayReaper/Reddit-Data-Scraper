    "postText": "If you guys want change and attention directed at your concerns we all just need to walk out pick a damn day and walk out for those that can make it ofc. A petition does and proves nothing, for all you know a student probably got their damn grandma to sign it or spread it so far a relative from texas signed it. Everyone gotta learn words do absolutely nothing lmao it\u2019s always about action. Directing attention when the administration don\u2019t want it or putting them on the spot is the only way to make them listen. Money is more important to them and if we don\u2019t go back to in person classes they can loose funding, they don\u2019t care about your safety, so keep sending emails and get a copy and paste response lol. Wouldn\u2019t be too funny if hundreds of students got together and news outlets showed up now would it.",

I remember people were planning to do a protest for more online schools but it was brick asf that day so everyone just said \u201cnope \ud83d\udeb6\ud83c\udffd\u201d and forgot all about it lmao. The issue is that there is a lot of people who do want online and those who don\u2019t. The people who don\u2019t tend to belittle those who do want online classes and they get like a shit ton of likes and then the comment section is full of people doing the exact same thing. So idek what to do",

The Omicron is 80% off its peak in NYC.\n\n  \nWhat are you walking out for, worried about catching a little cold?\n\nEveryone knows that you want a snow day every day. Even someone just posted, what do you want to commute 2 hours a day or walk out for 30 minutes.\n\nI'm going to in your face if you try and take away my in-person learning. You can bet on that. I'm going to be protesting right in your face and calling you out for taking away my in-person learning experience.",

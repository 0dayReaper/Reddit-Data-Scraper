            "comment": "AA or AS is reflective of how many liberal arts requirements your course of study requires you to take. My guess is that sometime between 2017 and now they changed the requirements for the degree to include less liberal arts courses, and now it\u2019s an AS degree. I don\u2019t imagine you can get it corrected because yours is already correct, just reflective of an earlier course of study.",

    "postText": "\n\nbasically if I don't enroll by tonight for the nelnet plan\ncan huny/hunter drop me, or is it something I have to pay off by the end of the semester and not be able to register for summer/fall until it's paid off? The plan means April 5th pay the 2nd 50% of your balance, it's a hold on my account that prevents me from going further which is why I intend to pay the full 947$ before April 5th... or can hunter cancel/drop my course enrollment by tonight? Just confused they told me in a email today was the last day to enroll in a plan but also failure to comply would result in inability to register in the future but will they cancel my class tomorrow? \ud83d\ude30 thank you any tips would be appreciated.",

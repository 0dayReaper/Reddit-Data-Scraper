    "postText": "I am 3 months late to this unfortunately but I just noticed in my CUNYfirst to-do list that I need to verify my FAFSA. When I go to Studentforms it asks me to upload my parents 2021 signed federal IRS form 1040X, but my parent has never amended their tax returns and the verification is overdue now. What can I do now? Is it also too late for me to even figure out a way since the verification process is overdue? Will I receive any financial aid?",

    "postText": "i feel like ill probably be downvoted for this but whatever. why the hell are so few online classes being offered?? they\u2019re always the first ones to be filled, so there\u2019s clearly a demand. lots of baruch/cuny students are commuters and also work, so it would be convenient for them. i see plenty of people on the subreddit who also seem to prefer online classes versus in person. to go along with that considering that not only covid cases are still very prevalent, there\u2019s also a rise of monkeypox, and manhattan is the most effected area. how is it that the only thing that cuny has said regarding the situation is that they\u2019re watching it closely? do they think it\u2019s not gonna spread on campus? the way it spreads is intimate contact, do they think college students are celibate creatures who don\u2019t interact with each other? it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s only going to get worse once the semester starts, so they should at least give the option to students to take classes virtually. istg they\u2019re gonna put off doing anything worthwhile until plenty of students are already infected.\n\nedit: also wanted to add that it can take up to 3 weeks for monkey pox symptoms to show, and isolation is recommended for 2-4 weeks. what is their plan to accommodate students who need about of month of quarantining??",

The Adams administration sees people back at work in-person as some kind of victory for this dystopic \"return to normal,\" and the same goes for the CUNY administration, who is beholden to them.  \n\nMy program this semester has 0 online classes. I read all the studies about the longterm effects of covid and know it's in my best interest to not get infected. CUNY offers basically no protections. And for all the in-person crusaders bemoaning your inability to learn online, the quality of the education, or not getting what you paid for\u2014IT'S NOT ALL OR NOTHING. Asking for SOME online classes does not interfere with your ability to go in-person. \n\nFor monkeypox, it looks like we're repeating all the same mistakes as early covid, and I agree nothing will be done until it's way too late. Their email was a bunch of PR hot air that basically said we don't have any plan yet. Monkeypox is spread through close contact, which obviously includes sexual, but it is also *airborne*, a fact the CDC and WHO recognised but scrubbed at the beginning of this outbreak, and it can live on surfaces for a long time. If you can get vaccinated, I would do it. This twitter account has a lot of useful information https://twitter.com/VioletEglantine\n\nStay safe and good luck",

            "comment": "The experience of the past two years is that online classes have significantly worse outcomes. Students don\u2019t do learn as much, in general, in these courses, even when they prefer it. Some students may do fine, a few do even better, but the overwhelming majority of students are not getting the education they need in online courses. \n\nTo be clear\u2014this the situation with *online courses in the way they\u2019ve been offered during the pandemic*.  We have decades of evidence proving that when online courses are taught by well-prepared, well-supported, well-trained faculty, to well-prepared, well-supported, well-trained students, in an effective, rich, and robust online learning environment, the learning outcomes are just as good. But that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s done at CUNY, not the students or faculty or system we have. \n\nSo CUNY will do everything possible to maximize in-person classes (not including specifically online programs). Because it\u2019s better for student learning. \n\nAs for monkey pox, at this time it\u2019s clear that for this outbreak, transmission is happening by close, extended, akin to skin contact. Only. That doesn\u2019t happen in classrooms. \n\nIf that changes (virus variant?), then that\u2019s going to change things. But for now, even though it\u2019s theoretically possible for monkey pox to stay on surfaces or spread through respiratory particles (note, this is *not* the same as aerosol spread, like covid), that is not currently happening.",

Further, students should be allowed to prioritise their health over the quality of their education if they so choose. \n\nDespite the current dominant strain being the most contagious, masks aren't required. Results of the ventilation audits have not been released. Classrooms don't have adequate HEPA filtration. What options do students who wish to be more cautious have besides their own N95 mask? Hiding behind \"it's better for student learning\" is PR sleight of hand to avoid the work and investment of doing what's best for faculty and students during a global health emergency. We must adapt.  \n\nThere is enough [evidence](https://its-airborne.org/mpx-timeline.html#event-evidence-that-monkeypox-is-airborne) to show monkeypox droplet *and* aerosol transmission, even if not the primary means of infection, to take adequate precautions, much like other governments advise, especially during a time when the virus is spreading at a perplexingly faster rate than previously observed. Classrooms are small, crowded, and highly trafficked. Why shouldn't we be overly cautious with a pox virus that is more fatal in children, that disfigures and can cause blindness, and whose pain can be so intense it drives patients to contemplate suicide? Even if we pretend for a minute this virus isn't a concern, SARS-2 *still* is\u2014why no precautions? Corruption. Negligence. Incompetence. Follow the money.\n\n\nedit: typo",

Meanwhile for in person classes I've seen full profs with normal full pay teaching THREE OR FOUR  students per in person class.\n\nThe people running CUNY basically have no idea what they are doing. A lot of people try to come up with all kinds of complicated reasons, but it's simply: they don't know what they are doing.",

Since resuming in person since Spring 2022 (Fall 2021 was mostly online for my programs), I've connected more meaningfully with professors and even got some job and graduate program recommendations. The awful part of remote was not having the opportunity to flex the interpersonal connections that really make college a necessity. There are a lot of online only degrees for getting that piece of paper but remote will never offer the same degree of networking with classmates and professors!",

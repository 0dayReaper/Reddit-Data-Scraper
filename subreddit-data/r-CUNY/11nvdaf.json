The reason is in the event you withdraw or our get WNs you wont have to return too much money. As long as your pending aid is greater than your tuition you will be ok. Your classes shouldn't get cancelled.",

It is my understanding that we won\u2019t  get our financial aid until we graduate at this point lol.\n\nJoking bc I\u2019m annoyed. But yes, it\u2019s delayed and prob will be for a while.",

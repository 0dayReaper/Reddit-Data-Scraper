    "postText": "I\u2019m a career changer looking to take pre med classes and was accepted at these four CUNYs as a second degree transfer student. I\u2019d be a post bacc student aiming to complete courses such as intro bio/chem/orgo chem. Since I work full time (remotely so I have some flexibility) my priority is being able to register for courses that fit in my schedule. I have a few questions:\n\n1. About ePermit: how would I qualify to be able to take classes at other colleges? What priority do ePermit registrations have?\n\n2. Do most evening/weekend bio/chem courses fill quickly? What would my chances be for registering as a transfer student?\n\n3. Does CUNY support transferring between schools? Not sure if that would be necessary with ePermit.\n\n4. Do the schools I listed offer committee recommendation letters for med school?\n\nThanks!",

However, you would have to take all or most of your classes in Hunter (which are tough), and get a high GPA, attend their sessions with other work to be able to qualify to get that letter. I don\u2019t know too much about it but you can ask around or look up the Pre-Health program at Hunter.",

When you need to epermit , you would request it through cunyfirst and when it\u2019s approved you will get emails to register .\n\nI know some schools in your list I considered but I find that getting a committee letter from Lehman was more doable than anything",

Baruch offers a committee letter as well and has a high admittance rate to dental/medical schools \n\nAlso, and this may not matter to you but did to me, with Hunter the science department has terrible reviews on ratemyprofessor.",

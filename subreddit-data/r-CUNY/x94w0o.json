    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI have noticed an abnormal amount of threads opening up asking questions like \"When is everyone getting a refund?!\" Unfortunately, everyone's situation can be dramatically different from one another and not everyone's financial aid package is the same, some individuals do not receive any aid at all and have to pay fully out of pocket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a guide that will explain to you the following:  \n\n\n1. How to check if you receive financial aid\n2. How to check when the financial aid will disburse\n3. How to check if the financial aid will be refunded back to you\n4. Deposit Timelines\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1.** **Am I getting financial aid?**\n\nTo receive financial aid, in the form of grants, (Pell grants and TAP) you must have had an EFC (Expected Family Contribution) of less than $5486. To check your EFC, login to CUNYFirst --&gt; Student Center --&gt; Financial Aid --&gt; Financial Aid Summary --&gt; Expected Family Contribution. \n\nIf your income in 2020 or your family's income in 2020 has drastically reduced 2022, you can file for an income adjustment appeal. The process of this appeal varies from school to school, most have you fill out a form, some require using StudentForms, but reach out to your Financial Aid office to file this appeal. The type of documents needed also varies from school to school.\n\n**2. How to check for Financial Aid disbursement**\n\nMany individuals on Reddit think disbursement means a refund. That is incorrect, disbursement means that the school has received the funds from the US Government (or wherever) and it has entered your \"school account\". **Disbursement DOES NOT mean you have been refunded the money.**\n\nIf you have confirmed you are receiving financial aid, you will also be given a disbursement date. To check for the disbursement date, log on to CUNYFIRST --&gt; Student Center --&gt; Financial Aid --&gt; Awards (left menu) --&gt; Disbursement Date. Let's use the most recent disbursement date as an example. \n\n**ALL DISBURSEMENTS AND REFUNDS OCCUR ON A MONDAY-TUESDAY SCHEDULE UNLESS MONDAY WAS A HOLIDAY, IN WHICH CASE TUESDAY BECOMES MONDAY**\n\nPell Grant 8/15/22\n\n8/15 means that the Pell grant will arrive in your school account on August 15th. To check if the amount has been disbursed, around 1-2 PM on August 15th, (you can replace this date with whatever your actual date is) check to see if the amount was \"Posted\" into your account. \n\nTo check if the amount has been posted, log on to CUNYFirst --&gt; Student Center --&gt; Financial Account --&gt; Account Activity. \n\nOn this page, you should see your financial aid amount in the \"Payment\" column. This occurs on a Monday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. Will I get a refund?!** \n\nNow that you have confirmed that your financial aid has been disbursed into your school account. Navigate over to your account balance. To do this login to CUNYFirst --&gt; Student Center --&gt; Financial Account --&gt; Account Balance (left menu).   \n\n\nIf you see a balance there, take note of this amount. Take this amount and subtract it from the amount that has been disbursed. If there is a remainder amount, you will be getting a refund. \n\nIf you have no balance, you will get a full refund of the amount that was disbursed.\n\nOnce you have confirmed you will be receiving a refund, **ON TUESDAY AROUND 3-5 PM** log on to CUNYFirst --&gt; Student Center --&gt; Financial Account --&gt; Account Activity (left menu). You should see the amount you calculated in the \"Refund\" column.\n\nOnce you see this amount in the refund column, it means they have sent out your direct deposit or mailed your check. **IF YOU DO NOT SEE AN AMOUNT IN THE REFUND COLUMN THAT MEANS YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING ANYTHING.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UNIQUE SITUATIONS**\n\nSometimes, some students get their aids approved well after the disbursement date. For instance, you filed for an income adjustment in the summer and got approved in Spring, (it can take that long) They now owe you for 2 semesters' worth of Pell Grants. Those Pell grants will be given the same OLD disbursement dates, but in this **UNIQUE SITUATION,** the dates do not mean anything. You just have to wait till the school receives the money, and in 1 or 2 weeks, it will follow the same Monday-Tuesday schedule. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. DEPOSIT TIMELINES**  \n\n\nIf you opted for a paper check, it will be mailed to you using **SNAIL MAIL** and it could take up to 3 weeks for you to receive your paper check.\n\nIf you opted for direct deposit, the deposit timelines vary from bank to bank.\n\nMVNO Banks such as \"Chime\" or \"Cashapp\" will release the funds usually on Wednesday, within 24 hours of the school sending it. I don't like waiting all week for my money so for school deposits I specifically use MVNO banks.\n\nRegular banks like Chase, BOA, etc, all follow the \"check date\" on the deposit which is a \"Friday\". But sometimes can be delayed up to Monday.  \n\n\n**ERPA Grants sent by Biden, DO NOT FOLLOW these timelines and have their own timelines, usually 1 or 2 weeks after the refund is issued.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this guide helps answer many questions a lot of you have about refunds. I wish you all the best of luck this semester.",

I just want to know if that\u2019s there for everyone even though you already did the application since that\u2019s like the first thing you do when you fill out tap forms.\n\nEdit: now I\u2019m just confused cuz I think that thing is the tap form itself and I already filled that out obviously since it\u2019s the tap form.

Your tap was just awarded to you, in order to meet the disbursement date on the 19th  you needed to have tap loaded atleast 3-4 weeks prior. \n\nSince you were awarded recently,  it will likely process this coming Monday, or next Monday. Your award will follow its own time line, not the one given to you on cunyfirst. Hope this helps.",

What they do after giving you the 700$ is that they charge your account 700$. That way when your anticipated aid arrives on the 19th, it automatically deducts the book refund. Eg:\n\nYou get a book refund for 700$. They charge your account 700$. You have incoming aid for 1700$. When the aid arrives, the school keeps the 700 they already advanced to you and you get the remaining 1k. \n\nI used the values above to keep the math easy. Your values could be different.",

To learn how to view that date: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have confirmed you are receiving financial aid, you will also be given a disbursement date. To check for the disbursement date, log on to CUNYFIRST --&gt; Student Center --&gt; Financial Aid --&gt; Awards (left menu) --&gt; Disbursement Date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf your schools date falls on a Friday (which it shouldn't because then the pay cycle would just be weird) then that would mean, Friday is the disbursement, Monday is when the money gets posted to your account, and if anything is left over, Monday is also when the refund would be issued. If that is the case, which is unlikely, you would receive your money between Thursday and next week Monday. But again, that just seems unlikely, I would confirm the disbursement dates using the guideline above. Remember, disbursement does not mean refund.",

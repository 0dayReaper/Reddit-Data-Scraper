Degree auditors in the Registrar\u2019s office have to manually and diligently check everyone\u2019s academic record to make sure they\u2019re good to graduate, and then everyone that\u2019s good to go gets graduated in one big batch. No one is officially graduated at the time of the graduation ceremony. If you\u2019re worried at all or unsure of your status, email the Registrar\u2019s office of your school.",

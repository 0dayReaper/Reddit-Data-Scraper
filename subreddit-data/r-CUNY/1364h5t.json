If you think withdrawing is your best option you have up to a certain date to drop and get a W which doesn't affect your GPA. You can look up the date. Be aware that this isn't something you want to do all the time because several W's can make you ineligible for F/A in the future. BTW I saw comments about getting a C. Consider your major before doing this. I know Nurses that had to re-take classes they got C's in when applying to Masters Programs like the NP and CRNA Programs. Same for PA programs. Those C's come back to haunt you.",

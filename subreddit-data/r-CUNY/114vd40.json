    "postText": "Hi, so recently on Tuesday I wasn\u2019t able to go to my classes because I didn\u2019t have anybody to watch my daughter , she\u2019s 2 and we don\u2019t do daycares. My parents watch her the two days that I do go to school. However they\u2019re out of the country as of now . I sent all my professors an email, most of them got back to me by that same day. All understood. For this one class my professor said we had an exam , and he just got back to me last night pretty late . (I also have him Thursday via zoom &amp; I was in that class ) he said that bc I missed the original exam I will have points deducted which is cool, I completely understand. However he also wanted a screenshot of my excuse ? What would I send him or what is he looking for ? A sc of my daughters birth certificate ?  Genuinely wondering what I should send him? I also asked him btw however he hasn\u2019t responded lol",

Just message him back, reiterate why you missed class, and ask what type of screenshot he would want for your specific situation. \nOn a separate note, unless you\u2019ve missed several classes, it\u2019s kinda\u2019 a BS move to ask for any kind of documentation - IMO.",

    "postText": "Hi guys,\nSorry to bother you all with a silly question. I\u2019ve been trying to reach my adviser for some time. But no luck. My question would be regarding graduation and applying for it. Basically, I was to graduate for spring 24\u2019, but this might be stretched out a little either to summer or fall. I have to wait and see how the classes are being planned in my dept. otherwise, by spring 24\u2019 I\u2019ll just need one lecture class and two additional credits. Would I still be able to go to commencement in circumstances like this? I would have no issue applying for summer 24\u2019 , my school allows us to walk then in spring 24\u2019\u2014 but, the class I need is also a random one with the lab class (in total 5 credits). I did a double major, finished one of the majors, it\u2019s just my final major completion I\u2019m working on. My concern is if I apply for summer 24\u2019, but don\u2019t meet the requirements if the course isn\u2019t offered would this be an issue if I just take the remainder in fall?\n\nMight be a challenge to follow but so far I haven\u2019t heard back from any adviser in weeks \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\u2026",

            "comment": "Hmm.. What school? I go to John Jay and have gone to BMCC previously.. so I'm going based on what happens there. Most schools offer the same classes over each summer.. Try searching for the class for the current summer semester to see if it's being offered. Make sure you uncheck \"open classes only\". If it is offered now then it'll probably be offered next summer as well. Not foolproof of course, but it's worked for me in the past. As for the commencement part, yeah you'll be able to walk i believe since you have less than 6 credits. Registration for summer classes will be open right around the time the graduation application opens/ends so you should have everything squared come March. All you have to do is pass the classes. Have no idea what happens if you walk but fail and have to come back \ud83d\ude05",

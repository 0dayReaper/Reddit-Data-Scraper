My friend didn't assume anything suspicious because he said he was a professor at CCNY. They added each other on wechat, and he messaged her about babysitting the kids but thankfully that day, she couldn't make it bc she had something busy that day. Then afterward, she removed him on wechat but didn't really find anything sus about it so left it alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think he mainly targets asian girls who go tech because my friend was on her way to tech and the person who posted this story is also a tech student.",

CCNY claims they take sexual assault cases seriously, but I don't think so if that article was written in 2000 and yet CCNY still hired him as a professor..\n\nI used to go to CCNY but transferred and thankfully I've never encountered with him.",

To prevent future girls from being preyed on by him. She wasn't the first girl he preyed on, and she definitely wasn't the last. It's not a rumor if multiple people come out saying he has done that. He's a pedophile. I don't care if he has kids or a job from CUNY, he has preyed on minors and he should be accounted for. You're defending a pedophile by not considering the victim's story. Many times a jury convicts someone when they're innocent and many times a jury votes innocent on someone who deserves to be given a label of predator or criminal.",

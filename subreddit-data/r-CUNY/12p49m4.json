    "postText": "I got into Macaulay Honors with QC as my home college.\n\nI had some questions about MHC\n\n1. How do the Macaulay Seminars/Honors courses work? Do I need to go into Manhattan for this? From what I can tell it's weekly?\n2. How do the seminars' timings work with scheduling conflicts with QC classes?  QC is about an hour commute to MHC and I'm worried it will be difficult to schedule my core classes around the seminars.\n3. Does QC offer online Classes at all? Or is it all in person?",

            "comment": "1. Macaulay seminars can be taken on campus or at Macaulay Central. Everyone usually takes them on campus. No travel to Manhattan required! Depending on your cohort, the seminars are taken once or twice a week. There are 4 seminars taken in order across your first 4 semesters.\n2. As previously mentioned, no commute to Manhattan is required. Macaulay Central offers courses and other varying seminars that will count towards your honors requirements, but they are optional. Everything can be done on your home campus.\n3. QC does offer some online classes.\n\nEdit: Current Macaulay QC student",

Besides the free tuition?\n\nI\u2019m planning for either a comp sci major or a math major with data science major track at QC. Do you have any experience with either or know anyone who does and what their thoughts are?",

You are also given an honors-designated advisor. I find that both advisors are great and extremely responsive, and you will meet with them frequently. Early registration is by far my favorite perk, as I have been able to register for classes with great professors before most students.\n\nWhile free tuition is granted to most students, it is the benefits that make it worth it. The seminars are ok, I don't care for them but they're required. I enjoyed being placed in classes with other Macaulay students because they gave me a sense of community at a school where everyone commutes and can be extremely anti-social.\n\nI can't speak on anything regarding your major(s) and minor, but I recommend asking the QC subreddit or Discord for their opinions on this",

I\u2019ve never heard of Macaulay not having the money for macbooks. Did they send you an email or something? Genuinely curious",

Whether or not they\u2019re pulling that out of their ass idk but I was entitled to it lmao i won it so i want it\n\nso far I haven\u2019t heard of anyone else dealing with this nonsense so lets see if in August they change their mind lol",

We were supposed to get the most recent MacBook but my class got the 2020 MacBook Air, which hey I'm not ungrateful about, However, the reason they 'downgraded' was because of the lack of funds. They actually had to hold fundraisers and ask alumni for financial support in order to get money to buy us the laptops. I remember them telling us this. I hope you guys get your laptops, that's one of the major perks of the whole Macaulay experience.",

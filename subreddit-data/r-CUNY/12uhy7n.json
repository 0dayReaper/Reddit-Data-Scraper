    "postText": "I applied for TAP part time from the supplement form and submitted it on CUNY website like 2 months ago and haven\u2019t received any email, notifications and the aid in general. Am I still eligible to get it this far into the semester? \n\nSide notes: \n\n1. my tuition is fully paid off now so I\u2019m not sure if it affects it or not\n\n\n2. I was dropped by a class earlier in the semester so I went from full time to part time and I\u2019m not sure if this affects it either as my application went through\n\n3. On the HESC tap website it says my TAP aid for the spring semester was \u201cDecertified by School\u201d so again, I\u2019m not sure this could maybe change or if this has an impact on my TAP part time aid",

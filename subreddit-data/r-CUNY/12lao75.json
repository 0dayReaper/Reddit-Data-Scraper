    "postText": "Hi everyone, I have a question. \n\nSo for me to graduate I need 4 more classes in the fall semester. But one of the classes is not in the curriculum and my advisor said I need an e-permit to get an equivalent course from another college. But when I searched in Cunyfirst, it says no equivalent courses are found. What do you guys think will happen? Can they just delay my graduation even though it is their fault for not providing the particular course? \n\nThanks",

You should go back to your advisor and try to see if there are other options to get the equivalent. Fault doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t have all the requirements, you won\u2019t be getting the degree.",

Have you tried the course equivalency tool?  \n\n\n[https://explorer.cuny.edu/](https://explorer.cuny.edu/)  \n\n\nGo to CUNY to CUNY by course, pick your course and select \"Transfer FROM\" (Not to) and you will see all the courses that are equivalent in other colleges.",

I finished my bachelor's in 2 years and I never once took an advisement session because it was pure garbage.\n\nUse the link I sent you to see if you can locate your equivalent class. If you rely on a counselor you will delay your graduation 100%. They do not and will not care about you. If you could also provide the class here I can locate your course equivalent.\n\nThe only courses that I know of that do not have equivalency are Baruchs finance and math courses due to the prestige and difficulty these programs have in Baruch. I don't know of other programs that have the same restrictions.",

Explain the situation, emphasize the fact that you graduate in the fall and one of the classes you need  to graduate it\u2019s not being offered is there another class that can be taken as a substitute. I\u2019m not sure when the last time the course was offered but if you know definitely include that or if it hasn\u2019t been offered in a while I\u2019m assuming include that as well. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s another course they can have you take and they can make an exception in degree  works for you.",

So around what month/semester should I apply for graduation and have my picture taken for the year book? \n\nAlso, BMCC\u2019s graduation commencement is only once a year in the summer so I\u2019ll be graduating on Summer 2024. Would that make me class 2024 or 2023?",

The way Cuny graduation works is a bit weird, on all your forms you\u2019ll fill out that you graduated 2023, so for all purposes, you\u2019re class of 2023, but at the ceremony, they might say class of 2024. It\u2019s a bit strange just because college semesters are shorter than hs",

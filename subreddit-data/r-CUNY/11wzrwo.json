If so, did you complete all the prereqs?\n\n2) If I don't get in this semester and finish the prerequisites by next semester, if I were to apply again, what are my chances of getting in for Spring 2024?",

I was told  by one friend you could be accepted but as a liberal arts major and  once all pre-requisites are net you can apply to transfer into the program. CCNY transfers from a different division into the grove school and other CUNY transfers have to follow the same eligibility rules. You can always email admissions and check the site eligibility rules",

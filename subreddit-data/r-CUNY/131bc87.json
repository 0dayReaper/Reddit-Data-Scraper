You can see how much you\u2019re eligible to receive from a Pell grant by logging into your FAFSA and viewing your Student Aid Report. Whatever number you see there will be applied to any school you attend. If that Pell estimate (not the EFC) is higher than zero, that money will be available to you wherever you go to school. Hope that helps!",

Pell and TAP stack so you can count on the fact that whatever was officially provided to you by the Federal Govt (Pell) and by NYS (TAP) should cover your cost of attendance. Full time at hunter should be around 8K (assuming you\u2019re commuting) so you should be in the clear between FAFSA and TAP. Just make sure Hunter got or gets your FAFSA.",

Speak to your financial aid reps at the respective colleges and get a feel, if all else fails, we have the excelsior scholarship too\u2014 but I\u2019m 99.9% sure you\u2019ll get through with your aid, CUNY is just disorganized as per usual.",

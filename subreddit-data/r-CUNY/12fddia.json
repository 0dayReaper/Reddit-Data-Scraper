Accept the offer, pay deposit if there is one, send immunization form, apply for housing of you are thinking of dorming, look for roommates or follow people who are planning on going to ccyn, a councilor will reach out to you later in the spring to talk about classes and signing up for them. Congrats on getting in.",

Just look for the schools emails! Also best advice, the second you can set up that advising appointment and get registered for those classes before all the good ones are gone. Goodluck!",

Not sure if this is offered at all Cuny's, but they provide a $300 stipend upon completing the weeklong workshop. Incredibly helpful tips to help familiarize yourself with the campus and all of its resources.",

I did study abroad with my school ccny last summer and this past winter  and it was not empty at all and I doubt for other cuny study abroad programs. You can always go to the Hunter thread and post there but I\u2019m certain the spain study abroad program will not be empty at all if anything study abroad is kind of competitive a lot if  students apply than there is space for .",

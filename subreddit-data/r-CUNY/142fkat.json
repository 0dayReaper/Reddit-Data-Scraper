    "postText": "I just got an email from the college. It was saying I need to fill a residency form to prove in-state residency status otherwise I'll be charged for out-of-state tuition and not be eligible for financial aid. I came to U.S in 9 june 2022 and became a New York resident in 4 April 2023. It's says that I need to be a resident of New York for 1 year for in-state residency. Will I still get financial aid? It would be impossible for me to study without financial aid. Sould I fill the residency form?",

Also, it might not cover the entire tuition since out of state is charged 2x-3x more than in state. Look into the dream act scholarship if financial aid doesn't work out. Good luck.",

Unlike a loan you don't have to pay that back and depending on your EFC it may cover up to 7.3k per year. If you aren't eligible for a pell then your school may offer a loan. I wasn't eligible for Pell but Baruch offered me loans to attend. John jay did not offer me anything. Luckily i got the excelsior scholarship which covers my JJ tuition. If you're a us resident then apply for that but if you're undocumented then apply for the DREAM act. Sorry for assuming you were.",

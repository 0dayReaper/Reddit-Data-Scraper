On a whim honestly, I enrolled for both of them this summer so like this in the fall I can just take the electives. Has anybody on here taken both capstone courses at the same time? Or should I just take them sequentially as instructed?",

For me, it's very challenging but it is doable. I would base your decision on time. Also, don't take Christopher Allen. He assigns way way too much.",

The classes for me are spaced out so I am taking different classes at different cohorts during the summer. Special thanks for that heads up too. He\u2019s not listed on my schedule (Sorry to whoever that is but we are trying pass and live our lives in peace \ud83d\ude05).",

I would say as long as you have a general idea of the research process and what you're doing you should be fine. The only thing I would be concerned abojt is having only 6 weeks to write the final capstone (assuming you're taking 401 or 435 over the summer)",

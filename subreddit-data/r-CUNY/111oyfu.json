            "comment": "I got to QC for CS. I'm almost done. I enjoyed it and think I had pretty decent professors. \n\nThe \"best\" CUNY is the one closest to where you live, tbh. In CS, the education is pretty standard at most schools. Don't buy into the hype. There is no \"best\" CUNY for CS. \n\nNow if you were saying you were transferring to Stony Brook or some other known school competitive for CS, that would be worth considering. But there is no CUNY that has a great rep for CS. They are all very average, and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nYou learn the basics and the theory, then you learn the trendy tech in your own time by reading documentations and man pages. You get what you put in at CUNY, doesn't matter which one you go to.",

That part also has me a little worried (not that I\u2019m gonna change my decision because of it but it\u2019ll help to know)",

At the end of the day 95% of the people in any given class you probably won't even interact with. CS isn't like the humanities classes where people are having open discussions in class and sharing opinions. It's usually a professor lecturing and you taking notes. Then assignments/tests.\n\nYou will find your people in CS or outside of it. QC has a bunch of clubs you can join and I know there was/is a \"Girls who code\" club. I recommend looking into that.",

I already knew it was gonna be majority males but as long as there\u2019s 2 or more females i should be good. \n\nAnd that\u2019s even better, I was never good at that stuff anyways; females or not. Thank you so much for your replies I appreciate it!",

However it's very rigorous and the pre-reqs are really tough to get into Grove (where their CS program is) . If you didn't make it into their Grove school, then you just wasted a year doing pre-reqs.\n\nWith that being said, it's probably best to go to aim for Stony or other state schools for CS.",

Looking at their catalog they have more CS classes than John Jay.\n\nIf you're more cybersecurity oriented, John Jay is pretty decent but there are barely any class availability (between 1-4 sections per course available during my Fall 2022 semester), and they fill up very quickly.",

            "comment": "I think it just means they are still looking into your verification, and once they are done with this whole process, they will send an email about how much financial aid you will get and etc. You just have to be patient, though. There are still like 5 months for the fall semester to start. Welp, I'll assume you're in the fall semester",

Hunter is providing students with this kind of help with fasfa and holds on their account. Do you know what cuny you're going to?",

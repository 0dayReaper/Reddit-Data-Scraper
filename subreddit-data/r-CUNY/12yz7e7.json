For example, starting CC as a biology major and transferring to a 4-year college as a computer science major. Also, there is a tool called explorer.cuny.edu where you can see equivalent courses and how they will transfer ahead. Overall as a student who went through the transfer process with 60 credits, I recommend saving money and going to CC.",

If you're really that concerned that some of your courses might not transfer then go straight to CCNY. The benefit of going to BMCC is you would have a much easier time completing math and science courses. The CCNY math department is notorious for being awful.",

If you stay at BMCC until you get your associate's you will then have to do only 6 credits more of general education (core) courses (otherwise you might have to do 9-12 credits). But it is also frequently true that not all community college major courses transfer to the senior colleges (like CCNY). Yes enrolling at BMCC but taking 1 or more courses at CCNY using the e-permit process might help, but you have to make sure that any CCNY course that you take that way will also count towards your BMCC requirements--it might only give you elective, not major, credit, which might turn out to be a problem for you finishing your degree. Finally, if you have to repeat courses or take extra courses due to transferring (and you might), being on financial aid doesn't take care of everything. That's because financial aid sometimes won't pay for repeated courses, plus you can run out of financial aid if you have to take excess courses. And if, due to having to repeat or take extra courses, you take an extra semester or two to get your bachelor's, you will be losing a bachelor's-level salary for 6 months or a year, and that might be a lot of money. One strategy some people follow is to go to community college just while they are taking courses that they know will transfer (e.g., general education and early major courses). But it can be tricky figuring out the timing out for that. Plus I think you'll need to go through the admissions process again if you transfer and there's no guarantee you'll get accepted.",

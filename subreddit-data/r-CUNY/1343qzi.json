We only have a handful of professors, and at points you can be stuck doing a required CS class with a shitty professor. Each school is different, but try to research on the different departments through their professors, such as websites like rate my professor, etc. It can be outdated, the student reviews but they can help. Best of luck on your CS journey!",

            "comment": "They don\u2019t kick you out right away. It\u2019s not like \u201c3.2, goodbye.\u201d There is a process of academic support first, and that might go on for a few semesters, and only then dismissal. If your GPA is close, and you\u2019re working with your advisor to keep it close and really doing everything they ask you to try (if your advisor says you probably need to change your major, change your major!), it\u2019s possible to stay on academic support for a long time. Even long enough to graduate if you\u2019re already within a couple of semesters. \n\nIf you are dismissed at the end of the fall, Macaulay will still pay your tuition for the spring. So you get that last semester but you won\u2019t get the Macaulay degree. \n\nIf it comes to the point of being dismissed, you can appeal. Appeals really only succeed if you\u2019ve got a real reason, that you can prove with real evidence, for your low grades. And you need to prove that you can bring them up. Something temporary and significant like a hospital stay or death in the family. \u201cI didn\u2019t study enough\u201d or \u201corganic chemistry is too hard\u201d won\u2019t work. \n\nGood luck! Even if you do get dismissed, lots of people actually find that to be a relief. You can go on and get your degree without that stress of the GPA requirement hanging over your head. Graduate with a 3.0 or a 2.7 or whatever, and have a bachelors degree and a happy and successful life.  It\u2019s not a shameful thing and might actually make you learn more because you\u2019re not constantly feeling like a failure.",

That\u2019s someone who can support you through the whole process and can talk to you about the specifics of your case. If you haven\u2019t talked to your advisor much yet, don\u2019t be embarrassed!  It\u2019s not too late. Make an appointment right now and talk even before any decision about academic support gets made. That won\u2019t happen until the campus progress reports which will probably happen next week or the week after.\n\nYou can read more in the student handbook on this page under Academic Support:\n\nhttps://community.macaulay.cuny.edu/handbook/policies/appeals-process-details/\n\nBut definitely talk to your advisor early and often!",

But from what I have seen, if there is a real reason for the decline in grades and a real plan for doing better, and evidence for both of those, and if the advisor supports the appeal (not always required, but very helpful), the odds of it being granted are extremely good. \n\nA committee makes the decision, and they don\u2019t know you other than what they see on paper. So you really have to make sure that you submit everything necessary and that your writing and explanation are clear and persuasive. Definitely proofread carefully!",

If not, it\u2019s almost impossible to be dismissed. You would get the support before anyone would even consider dismissing you. If you\u2019ve been on academic support already, did you follow up with the requirements (other than the gpa)?  \n\nJust repeating\u2014talk to your advisor. That\u2019s the best first step.

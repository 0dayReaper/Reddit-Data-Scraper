It\u2019s also the most experiential program at CCNY. \n\nPeople talk a lot of crap about CCNY but all new findings and college ratings show that it\u2019s a top school and primarily because of its engineering program. \n\nIn NYC if you get in to Columbia or Colleen Union for engineering good for you but CCNY engineering school is way better than the rest and you will most probably graduate without much debt.\n\nMy \u00a22.",

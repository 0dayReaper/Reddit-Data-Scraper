    "postText": "I'm a junior, and fafsa has always paid for my education. This spring semester, I received approximately $2.5k in refund. I'll most likely pay out of pocket next semester (fall '23). My question is whether or not I will receive a 1098T. Technically, my school's scholarships and grants will exceed eligible tuition billed charges for the TAX YEAR, so I'm guessing no?  I'd rather use the money from the refund to pay for maybe 1/3 tuition and fees, so it won\u2019t really be considered \u201cout of pocket\u201d as I\u2019m using the money I got from fafsa/tap. I hope this is clear. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks!",

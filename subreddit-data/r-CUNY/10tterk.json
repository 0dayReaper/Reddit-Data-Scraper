    "postText": "One of the terms of the excelsior scholarship is that you must complete 30 credits every academic year. I just realized I enrolled in a class that is under \u201celectives allowed.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not supposed to take this class. If I decide to drop it and take one this summer - will the summer classes credits be taken into account, and in other words would excelsior respect it and still grant my scholarship ?",

    "postText": "I applied to 4 CUNY schools as a transfer in December and received acceptances from John Jay (Applied Mathematics), Queens College (CS) &amp; City Tech (CS) in February.\n\nGiven that the Commitment Deposit Date is approaching (mine was waived) &amp; advisement is available to plan for the Fall semester, is it smart to wait until July 1 to see if I got into CCNY (undecided)?\n\nCCNY is my top choice &gt;.&lt;\n\n**NOTE:** I emailed CUNY admissions to change my major from CS to undecided for CCNY, and it took them a month to fulfill my request. My major was changed on April 7th. I imagine this could also be a reason why I haven't heard back.\n\n**UPDATE! I got accepted. BRUH this is crazy I just received a Financial Aid Offer from CCNY 7 minutes ago (2:51 PM)**",

I should call admissions but gosh sometimes they take a while to pick up ;-;",

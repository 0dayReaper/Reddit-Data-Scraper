I am not sure which MA you are referring to but let's use mental health counseling for instance.\n\nSchools like Baruch, Hunter, City college have deadline dates one year - 8 months before the actual start date. Baruchs deadline for MA is December 1st, 2023 for classes that start in August of 2024. Each school is different. John Jay has a very lenient deadline of August the same year. You need to check on their respective websites. A quick Google should do.",

It\u2019s a group interview and it starts off with everyone (15-20ppl) on zoom and then they break you out into groups of 4 with each group having 1-2 interviewers (they\u2019re on their 20s). \n\nYou start off with ice breakers, what they asked was to introduce yourself and something interesting about you, what\u2019s a recent book you\u2019ve read or a favorite one, what\u2019s a time you showed flexibility and adaptability whether in a professional setting or not, and other questions i don\u2019t remember. \n\nThen at the end they have you work with your group to create a CBO/Non Profit based on the borough/community they\u2019ve assigned your group with. You create this CBO to address ONE of the issues your borough is dealing with and make a presentation (google slides). They provide all the links and give you a 20min time limit. You have to create a name for the CBO, job roles for each person, solution, and at the end EVERYONE needs to present in the break out room. They will ask you follow up questions like why did you choose this issue to address and explain more about your role. Then the breakout rooms end and everyone gets together on zoom and say you\u2019ll hear from them in 2 weeks.\n\nNot sure if everyone went through this, but this is what I experienced recently.",

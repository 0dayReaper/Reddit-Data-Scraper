You have to meet income and residency guidelines. It's free for those at the income guidelines for $0 contribution. Are you a traditional international student or are you here under parole as a refugee, for example Ukraine, etc. I only ask about parole because you can contact the organization or social services liason that assists you to inquire about applying if you are on parole. If you're a traditional international student you can inquire about insurance through CUNY. There most likely will be a cost with that.",

    "postText": "I dropped three different classes with a W grade in three semesters. One drop per sesmter. Will I be placed under academic warning for this? I promised myself to do better this semester, but unfortunately, my dad kicked me out of the house after we fought, so Im basically homeless for now and had to drop a class to ease the workload. For more reference, I study at CCNY, Grove School.",

I attend Baruch so IK our schools are different but I haven\u2019t heard of any CUNY flagging a student for dropping a singular class per semester. However it might be flagged if the semesters were consecutive. Your best bet would be to speak to an academic advisor, seeing as though you wouldn\u2019t want anything to interfere with financial aid.

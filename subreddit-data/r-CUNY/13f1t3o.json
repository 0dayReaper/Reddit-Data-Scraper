    "postText": "I'm going to take a summer class at BMCC. The class starts May 30th. Everything else is good to go except the MMR form. I have already registered for a class and I have a hold from Bronx CC about the MMR acknowledgement and form. BMCC doesn't have any holds for me. I want to submit the form but can't because my doctor won't sign off on it unless I schedule and appointment. I setup one for June 5th. Is there a way I can still go to class or do I have to wait until I submit the form. I also have my yellow card if that helps.",

            "comment": "Requiring an appointment to fill out a form is some nonsense. Your doctor has to release your records by NY state law. I can\u2019t speak to Bronx CC specifically, but I sent Queens the parts of my record that related to the MMR vaccine and they accepted it. You might check with them if they\u2019d be willing to accept the yellow card or other parts of your record you could obtain from your doctor without the appointment.",

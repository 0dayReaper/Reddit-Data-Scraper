    "postText": "To all CUNY Admins, Chancellor, Presidents. The last few months have been difficult to say the least; transitioning to online classes, the stress of living in a pandemic, living in close quarters with family non-stop for the last three months. I can say with utmost certainty many students want to begin to resume life, even if it isn\u2019t even close to what we used to consider normal. But that isn\u2019t going to happen if you continue to remain silent.\n\nEvery week or so, the COVID page on CUNY.edu updates to add minor details regarding CR/NCR policies, wishing the graduates well and so on. However one important detail has been left out - some kind of plan of how you plan on reopening. We haven\u2019t heard a word. There have been rumors of memos flying around, articles about how adjuncts have been laid off and even the DOE Chancellor for NY public schools saying it\u2019s a 50/50 shot of them going back to in person in any capacity.  But we have yet to hear anything directly from a CUNY Admin. I understand that it\u2019s not entirely your call; our \u201cwonderful\u201d Governor probably hasn\u2019t thought about it yet. I get it. But what isn\u2019t ok is the complete silence as you begin to take our money for the fall semester. \n\nI think it\u2019s come across all our minds that in-person just isn\u2019t possible within the CUNY ecosystem. We are too crowded, too few teachers and too little space. It\u2019s understandable in a public university. Not only that, but you are unable to hire enough cleaning staff to keep surfaces disinfected. We get these issues; but these are things that should be transparent to every student, faculty and staff members. We\u2019re tired of staying in the dark.\n\nI\u2019m asking for some kind of transparency; something that has been completely lacking throughout this entire pandemic. Tell us what to expect, or at the very least tell us when we can expect an announcement.     \n\nMy hope is that more students will add ideas below, but I can only ask that if classes should be moved online, that teachers adopt a format designed to be online rather than just pretend we are in person. This was the major issues with transitioning online- teachers expected us to keep up with the same level of work without taking into consideration many students are cramped into a small apartment with anywhere from 3-5, or possibly even more family members. This was a major issue for me, trying to concentrate using a small table to balance my laptop and textbook. It didn\u2019t work. So my hope that all of this time spent not talking to us was used to train what remaining faculty is left to teach online. \n\nTo my fellow students, I hope this post is used to offer more suggestions and voice more concerns to CUNY admins should they find it.",

The summer class is done well, where the professor lectures and quizzes are done instead of exams. You can\u2019t do big exams with an online class, I just don\u2019t think they are done well.\n\nWith asynchronous they let you do things on your own time, which is good if you have decent time management skills. \n\nSo long story short, I\u2019d say both should be offered if possible so someone can choose the best way they learn, however asynchronous learning would be better if recorded lectures and assignments aren\u2019t ridiculous",

Another massive issue I've run into is that the urban studies courses I need I can't get for fall because they've fired so many professors that there is only 1 section for each, which are now all full. So, my options are to take a semester off or take a bigger leap and switch my major. It sounds crazy, but if this is at all predictive of what they'll be doing to the urban studies department, why would I stick around to find out? Why would I waste my money? They must realize what they're doing will only force people into a few select majors(the more popular ones like STEM majors clearly get more funding to begin with) and alienate everyone else, right?",

I mean to be fair, I think private universities have their heads up their asses if they think in person classes/forming is gonna happen in nyc",

I\u2019ll provide my input so you might not wanna make the same mistake I made \n\nFor CUNY only 3 colleges offers an engineering degree and they are all quite different not so distinct but still a substantial difference \n\nThe three are CCNY, City Tech, and CSI\n\nCCNY - Bachelors of engineering \nCSI - Bachelor of science \nCity Tech - Bachelor of technology \n\nIf you really want an engineering degree that\u2019s considered the standard engineering degree, then CCNY is the college to go to for CUNY\n\nI was at City Tech as well aiming to graduate with Engineering which was different from what they offer which is Engineering Technology. That is different from Engineering and you can research into that. Engineering Technology is more practical and doesn\u2019t necessarily make you an engineer \n\nIt can limit some engineering positions. If you get an associate In engineering technology from city tech, there\u2019s no mention of engineering it just says \u201cApplied Science.\u201d Most of the major credits wouldn\u2019t transfer should you decide to go to a school with Bachelors of Engineering.\n\nHowever, CCNY is quite challenging and if you don\u2019t pass AP calc in high school, you will have to take a placement test and depending on ur score, will probably start with Algebra or pre calc. If you are a bright student, you can go for CCNY right away but the classes are much harder \n\nIf you don\u2019t pass the placement test, you get into CCNY but not the engineering school(Grove) you will have to take their pre requisites classes and meet the requirements to get into grove(engineering school). That info should be on their website \n\nOr you can take all the pre requisites at a community college and then transfer to CCNY if you want easier classes. But make sure to know the classes that will transfer and try to get a higher gpa. Also the requirements for freshmen and transfer students are all on the CCNY grove admission website",

The only difference is the name of the degree and my friends at city tech has said that their program is easier.  When it comes to finding a job, it will come down to your internships, projects and skills that you possess. Grove is okay and typically what people will push you to apply for but it's not the only option. Your case is a little different than mine because my major is com eng and I knew at city tech my learning would be more application based and I prefer that. I would suggest setting up an appointment with the head or someone from each of the departments for both schools and ask questions to access the differences of the programs of study.",

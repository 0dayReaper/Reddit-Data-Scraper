May 1st is tomorrow and that's the deadline for most of the colleges in CUNY to pay the commitment tuition deposit and be accepted, unless you've filed the FAFSA and the application fee was waived. I chose Baruch, Brooklyn and Medgar Evers, but Baruch is the only college that sent me emails notifying me that they received my application for this fall and the open house. This could be a major clue that I'll be heading to Baruch this Fall, leaving Brooklyn and Medgar Evers behind while starting my journey to a bachelor's degree in English.",

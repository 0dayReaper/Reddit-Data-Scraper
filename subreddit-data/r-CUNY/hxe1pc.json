Why are we still being charged for technology and student activity fees? We are not in school physically to use any of the technology they offer. CUNY is seriously the worst. This frustrates me because I don\u2019t get any scholarship OR financial aid or tap. I pay everything out of my own pocket.",

I don't mind group projects cause I always take the lead and tell others what to do. Most of the time my group mates either liked me approach to things or hated it. I had no time for bullshit cause I was working up to 65 hours a week.  I had a situation last fall where this one person was in tears begging me not to submit the presentation without their part and I simply said that I do not care. We had a month to work on it. They were not responding to any of my emails, messages any outside of the class room conversation, until the day it was due and it was due at 6am before class starts.",

The reason why is because it operates on such slim margins. You can\u2019t compare paying the same price for all online classes at CUNY to the robbery Harvard and other schools are committing ; I heard it\u2019s like 50K a semester and they\u2019re making it online classes. CUNY really is a godsend and I don\u2019t mind paying the original price for online this semester; it is what it is. However, if I was a NYU or Harvard student paying that price and it\u2019s online; that\u2019s a diff story. Price point should be taken into consideration when complaining. CUNY adjuncts already gets paid at a subhuman level ; you wanting to pay less is like you not wanting them to have the already low pay they get and they teach you the stuff that gets you the job you need.",

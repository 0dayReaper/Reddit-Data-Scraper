    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI had a question regarding the future possible consequences of receiving a \"W\" grade, which is put on one's transcript when they drop a class. \n\nIf I drop a class (which is a class needed for my major) and receive a W grade, will it affect me in the future when I want to apply for Jobs and Internships?\n\nI plan on retaking the course in a future semester, I was just wondering if it would be bad if it's on my transcript and I am applying for jobs and internships.\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated!\n\nthank you",

If you take a few credits like, for example, 3 credits, and you slipup by getting a grade below 2.0 GPA, you are at risk of probation. While if you take an average course load which most people take (12-18 credit), you are safer because of grade average. + eligible full time students get most financial aid and refund in their bank account.",

Pending the results of my transfer credit evaluation, I might go full-time if none of my credits transfer from Kingsborough(which is something I want to avoid). If my credits do transfer successfully, I might go part-time just like I did while I was at Kingsborough.",

It may not transfer the way you want it to like for example you took a speech class at kings borough and it transfers over as an elective at Hunter hypothetically but all your credits will transfer over. 12 credits is considered full time in college and for financial aid proposes. If you feel like 15+ is a lot just do 12credits which should be 4 classes and if you feel comfortable later on doing more credits you can for the following semester. One thing I did was always see the classes I\u2019m taking like the level of difficulty and either I would do 12 one semester and 15 the next and just do a summer or winter class to make up the difference for the academic year so I still had 30 credits at the end of the year.",

Are you sure that 12 credits is comfortable enough to do for now? If the classes are difficult, should I reconsider?",

The problem is that the essays I'll be writing will have to be legible and coherent and 14 weeks will be my first challenge in a long time.",

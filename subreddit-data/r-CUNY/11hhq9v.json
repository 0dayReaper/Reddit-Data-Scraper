    "postText": "Hi everyone, I go to QC and applied for fafsa a month ago. My efc is $2398 for the 2023-2024 year but I\u2019ve looked at my financial aid awards and it\u2019s a total of $5k per sem. I looked at the ebill from last year and added what was charged to me and everything seems to be a total of around $4500. If my calculation is right, I should be getting back $500, but don\u2019t know why it\u2019s saying I\u2019m paying $2398 out of pocket?? Makes no sense. Has anyone encountered this before? What was the outcome? \n\n(I live with a parent)",

I used to have an efc of zero but when I entered my financials (under student financials), I no longer get the maximum pell and tap. Regardless, my awards showing that I\u2019m getting a little over $5k so I just assumed it will cover my tuition and fees\u2026 but the efc\u2026 idk why it\u2019s 2398.",

When I applied to CUNY I remember it also said \u201cdesired\u201d for my foreign hs transcript, and it was the very last document they received. But it worked out in the end (I\u2019m a sophomore in college now) I think you just have to wait. \n\nIf not email your high school to follow up, and email CUNY to let them know of your situation if you\u2019re worried.",

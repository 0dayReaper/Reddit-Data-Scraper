    "postText": "So in Fall 2023, I will be entering my 5th year since I switched my major and I got an email saying that I got a balance on my account saying I owe $3,719.85 that I have to pay by July 14th for Fall 2023. I already applied for FAFSA and TAP. I checked the financial aid tab of cunyfirst and for some reason I don't see the Federal PELL Grant for 2023-2024. I don't think it has anything to do with the IRS/tax since there wasn't that big of a difference from the previous. I see TAP Grant only. Is it just too early and that's why I don't see it? Or is it because I don't get as much aid since I'm going into my 5th year? I don\u2019t think this ever happened or maybe I just never noticed until now lol\n\nExtra info/Update: I checked my SAR report on FAFSA and for 2023-2024, it said my family contribution was over 5000 and I won't be receiving the Federal PELL grant. But for 2022-2023 it was 0 so now I'm confused",

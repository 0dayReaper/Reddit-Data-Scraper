It\u2019s like in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI went to Queensborough for a year which is even more in the middle of nowhere... I live in Middle Village. Over an hour and a half commute on the bus to get there, it was miserable. This was back in 2010 too so smartphones weren't as good - I had a blackberry, and I couldn't afford an ipod, so I had a crappy mp3 player that the battery only lasted 2 hours on. I hated it so much.",

Diverse in a number of ways, from politically, to culturally, to background which brought with it its own pros that defined teaching styles. Can't overstate how awesome my professors there were.\n\nIts a 4-year school with many branching paths in the center of a huge metropolitan area with some interesting networking opportunities and faculty that have surprising pull and connections in places you probably wouldn't think of venturing without some prior prompting. Truthfully, no one else can tell you which would be better for you.\n\nWhat you want to study comes down to what you personally feel interested more in, if you can see a viable career path in it in the future, and if not that, what else would you be able and willing to pursue at said school if not either of those. I was taken aback when I saw my alternatives when I got to JJ, so it could be the same for you there or at QC, but first be sure of what you want to do. Look up alternative experiences too. Clubs, study abroad, which would better indulge your curiosity in studying other things like a second/third language, etc.",

    "postText": "Is anyone else fed up with people in the group chats expecting their classmates to take their fucking class for them? I mean, it's fine when they ask for help every now and then. However, I have noticed since going online there are people who if they cannot find everything on quizlet or coursehero will literally ask for answers and material every single week. This came to a head specifically these past two weeks because of midterms where they are completely lost. Professors have gotten very good at making sure their midterms are cheat proof or they've at least stifled the effort within the time limit. Now these students who haven't done shit on their own for the entire semester are completely lost. To the people who are like this; what is your plan for next semester?",

You never know who might get pissed and try and throw everyone under the bus so take that into consideration when deciding whether to stay or not. You sound like a good student and probably have nothing to gain from staying but that's on you.\n\nYou do what you feel is right but personally I choose not to report them. They're only hurting themselves and I don't get involved. Karma will come in the form of their grade in this class or the next and I don't see it as being my job to expedite the inevitable.",

Don't associate with lazy, they have nothing to offer and will bleed you dry. It's better to only have a few high quality friends than connect with the worst students.

I still did my work and received great grades but my point is, you don't know everyone's situation and there may be a reason for the slacking. However, you're right -- students shouldn't benefit off of the hard work of students who do the work. Keep on doing your best but try not to be so condescending about students who aren't doing the same. Everyone needs help at some point and you never know when you'll be in that situation too.

I don\u2019t make people feel uncomfortable by creating a cheating environment in every group chat. I don\u2019t harass people for their answers or to take my exams for me.

But, there are still many scenarios where students may not try their best at no fault of their own. Sometimes taking a gap year isn't in their best interest either. You do have a tone of superiority by saying you don't do X,Y,Z and therefore the people who do X,Y,Z are the problems. You're also talking as if you know all the solutions. \"Taking a gap semester or a year if you cannot handle your course load.\" So what about students who are parents? Who have full time jobs? Are they supposed to wait until their children are old enough to help themselves or quit their jobs just to handle school? Be realistic. What worked for you may not work for everyone else. \n\nAs for students who are simply just not trying, I get the frustration. If you or anyone else feels uncomfortable in the chat, you can simply leave. As for the harassment, if it gets too much consider blocking them or threaten to go to the professor for them. They'll stop immediately.",

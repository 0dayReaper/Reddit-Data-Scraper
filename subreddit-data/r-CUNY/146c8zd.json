            "comment": "I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to take advantage of many of the programs and clubs John Jay had to offer but their entire program is geared towards cybersecurity. My advisor helped me land a internship.\n\nNot sure what the CIS curriculum entails but the CS/IS that John Jay has is technical and can land you technical positions because it is a computer science degree with a focus on information security.\n\nAlthough I congratulate you on being accepted for John Jay and Baruch, take a look at John Jays dual joint degree Computer Science and InfoSec with Community Colleges. If you\u2019re paying out of pocket for tuition or taking out a loan, going to community college can save you a lot of money (or if you ever decide to switch majors). The dual joint degree program automatically guarantees you a seat after you graduate from a Community College.\n\nQueensborough Community College was a great college experience with great professors. I believe BMCC/LGCC also has this partnership with John Jay, you\u2019ll have to double check.\n\nAnd from experience, the CS classes fill up quick for JJAY and you may be left waiting for next semester to sign up for a specific class. The good CS professors in JJAY are also slim pickings so it\u2019s best to get the classes out of the way in community college.\n\nIf you decide to go to John Jay, I highly recommend (as electives) taking the CSCI 278 Office Management Tools (it\u2019s literally a class about using Microsoft Office which I have appreciated taking since the majority of corporate functions use Word and Excel heavily) and CSCI 380 with Eric Spector, the course is about project management and cybersecurity.\n\nBest of luck on your journey!",

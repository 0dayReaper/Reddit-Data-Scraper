    "postText": "I had the choice to go to other schools, but chose CUNY because of money. I planned on going to grad school and wanted to save as much as possible. I was pretty bitter and jealous that all my friends had real college experience: Greek life, parties and dorming together, and professors who were famous experts.     \n       \nWith the pandemic, none of that is happening. 3 semesters (maybe 4) was completely wasted. That's two years of money actually saved with no downside and no education quality change. It's mean but I feel petty about it. That's not to say online school isn't stressful and lonely, but it was pretty bad before already.",

Seemed like there was always an event going on in the main hub. I wasn't really interested in that stuff but it was there for people that wanted it. I did, however, take some of the food they had leftover after the event. There were also a lot of educational opportunities and job opportunities that they offered. I'm currently apart of ACE (A program in John Jay) which has helped me a lot such as getting free textbooks. I also recently joined CUNY Cultural Corp and I'm working with some amazing people. I was planning on joining a club but covid happened. I am hopeful that things will return back to normal in Fall 2021 though.",

There is no financial assistance for the school of general studies. They are somewhat generous for the engineering and A&amp;S departments. Even then, most non-wealthy students are stuck in some level of high debt.",

I know that other Ivies if your family makes like under $60k you get your tuition and board paid for. I guess that's not the case at Columbia",

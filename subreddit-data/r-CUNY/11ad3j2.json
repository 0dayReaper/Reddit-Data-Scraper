    "postText": "I just got into the Hunter program and I am leaning toward just accepting the offer. I know it has a great reputation, generally, but I\u2019m wondering how current nursing students there feel about the program.  (Background: my ADN program also had a great reputation but once I got in I realized the whole thing was held together by spit balls)\n\nThoughts?  Looking for personal experiences from recent/current Hunter or Lehman nursing students.  Wondering how often the Hunter RN to BSN students have to attend classes in person rather than online. \n\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a",

So now I am considering just going to CCNY (I got waitlisted by Macaulay), and transferring out. My question is, does going to a cuny hurt your chances of getting internships and advisors?",

Avoiding building up student debt is a real consideration. Obviously, you\u2019re a good student and will do well wherever you go. The choice between CCNY and SB is, at least in part, the type of college lifestyle experience you want for the next four years. If your goals will require you to go to grad school after undergrad, then living style of the next four years is a real consideration. So what do you prefer - live on campus at a big upstate college or live in NYC?",

For ccny even if i got rejected from their Macaulay honors, what about their regular honors program? I have not heard anything about that and I have asked like everyone.",

My personal experience as a non-traditional student who overlooked CUNY because of the stigma is that I got a better education at CUNY after leaving Marymount and Iona. I am graduating from KCC as an Honors Student, PTK and have my choice of schools with a full ride. My major was Business Administration and my Professors were top notch. I vetted every Professor when registering for classes and only had 1 bad Professor and that's because her RMP ratings were bought. I'm a Film Student and BC is my 1st choice but if I can't find housing Syracuse is my 2nd choice because networking is important for Film Majors.",

I was also waitlisted from Macaulay, but I\u2019m still going to choose Hunter because I don\u2019t want to build up debt while being in undergrad. If you work hard and look for the right people, you\u2019ll be able to find internships. Some teachers at the CUNY could possibly help you out. Someone I know attended a CUNY (I\u2019m not sure if they did internships), but they seem to be doing good now. They\u2019re currently in dental school at Columbia.",

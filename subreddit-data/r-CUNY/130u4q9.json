Don\u2019t know about Hunter but here at ccny  the business and economic department has 3 majors you might be interested in  business administration and management, finance or economics. While I\u2019m not any of these majors they are in the Collin Powell school division and I\u2019ve had nothing but great teachers for the most part, great opportunities and resources, advisors etc. If you plan on transferring to Baruch you may be better off waiting a year and transferring for your sophomore year.",

Especially since SPS is all online, I was thinking employers may not really think anything of a degree obtained from SPS. Thanks for the insight.",

There are a lot of students that take advantage of the Accelerated Degree Nursing Programs after getting their degree from SPS. As far as employers the primary concern is can you do the work. That will show whether you graduated from an on-line program or not. What I do see happening is other schools distinguishing if you were physically on campus or not. I left SPS and went to KCC which has an on-line program called FLEX. I'm graduating and other Colleges asked about on-line programs not Employers.",

I was able to work my way up in HIM without a degree but capped at 75K. I needed at least an Associates to break the the 100K curse \ud83d\ude44. I didn't want to wait for my Bachelors because I can work and go to school. Since COVID there are remote options even outside the Country. The Business Professors ar KCC are top notch. I went in person in 2011 and knew I wanted to go back. I would recommend their BA Program through Flex to anyone that asks but not KCC.",

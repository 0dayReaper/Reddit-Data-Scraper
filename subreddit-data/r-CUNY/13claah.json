However, I was able to get a scholarship which pays most of the tuition. If there\u2019s a balance, you would have to pay of out pocket. That scholarship saved me so much money though. I would highly recommend it if you\u2019re in the rad tech or dental hygiene program. Best of luck.",

I found that requirements were hard because they\u2019re all science core classes but also classes when in the program are all difficult too because it requires countless hours of studying and you\u2019re taking multiple classes which have their own set of difficulties. I think though that whoever you ask about the program will agree that it is a difficult program. That program is not for the weak.",

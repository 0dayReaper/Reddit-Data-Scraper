    "postText": "It\u2019s so frustrating how professors are giving so much more work just because everything is online. \n\nIt\u2019s coming to a point where I\u2019m just sitting in my room crying in frustration. I know everything is online but some of us still has to go to work while attending classes. In one month of school, I already did 2 12-pages research paper, 5 tests and a couple essays.\n\nSome of these professors really be doing to much. I\u2019m so exhausted. If everybody would just follow the motherfucking covid guidelines to keep themselves and everybody else safe from covid, we wouldn\u2019t be in this fucking situation\n\nEdit: I wasn\u2019t gunna go this far or this deep but like in Asian countries, wearing masks is the norm for them but in America when it is suddenly enforced to have everybody to wear masks, it\u2019s taking away their freedom. If anything, them not wearing masks is taking away ALL Americans\u2019 freedom. Because they refuse to wear masks and to practice social distancing, there are so many restrictions now. Things I was once able to do last year, I can\u2019t do this year. It\u2019s beyond frustrating",

I'm taking 4 classes and this week alone I have a huge exam, another timed writing exam based on 4 books, a bibliography, 3 quizzes in 3 different classes, and a DB paragraph and response to a student. its SOOOO RIDICULOUS.",

For a 100 class that I have, every other week we have to turn in a 1-page annotation, 3 page response, and take a quiz for readings that are 60 pages long.",

I\u2019m in the same boat as you, crying from being so overwhelmed, and I just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and sent my professor and email telling him how much stress and anxiety his workload was causing me. I mentioned that the amount of work is making me not even learn or digest the material because I\u2019m just having to plow through all the work so fast. After being very open and honest, he actually pulled back a little bit and lightened the workload. So, maybe try that. If your professor isn\u2019t responsive to that, then you can reach out to the department chair. \n\nI know this all really sucks, but just know that you\u2019re not in this alone. Hang in there.",

Feel like professors think because it\u2019s online, it\u2019s suddenly too easy + we have more time, (even tho neither is the case) so they try to balance that out by assigning more work. This pandemic is hard on everyone, not to mention students like me who also have a job, and it\u2019s just ridiculous the work load they place on us.",

The school then disburses your aid. Are you taking 12 credits? Have you registered for classes yet? F/A gets revised throughout the year for a slee of reasons. Just be aware that if at anytime you no longer meet the eligibility requirements your aid gets revised. For example if you register for 12 credits but drop a class.",

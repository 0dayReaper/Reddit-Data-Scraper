    "postText": "So I enrolled in 2 summer classes. One goes towards my degree in degreeworks, the other one does not. I just realized this now. I wanted to drop the course that doesn\u2019t count, however, I read that my tuition will not get refunded. Now, looking in the Financial Account section in CUNYfirst, I see that I owe money and there are no pending financial aid. However, when I go into the Financial Aid section of CUNYfirst, after tweaking the settings to show the Summer Term, it says there is a Federal Pell Grant scheduled in July. Now my question is, if I drop the course I don\u2019t need and get a W grade on it, will that effect the Federal Pell Grant that\u2019s supposedly scheduled in July? Will I have to pay out of pocket for the course I didn\u2019t need? What about the other course (the other course that I actually do need starts in mid-July). Also, does and will a W grade effect my academic records and academic career?",

You will still be expected to pay full tuition for the dropped course. \n\nYou must also be aware that you need to be registered for at least 6 credit hours in order to receive a Pell grant.\n\nContact your college's financial aid office for more information.",

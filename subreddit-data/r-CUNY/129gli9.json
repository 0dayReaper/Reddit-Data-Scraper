    "postText": "I\u2019m in finance, but nowhere near quant focused stuff. I\u2019m heavy on deal making and raising capital. Sibling wants to study math and statistics to break into quant finance as a quant trader or researcher. Seems like a long shot to me given they have not been accepted to quant feeder schools.\n\nThey\u2019ve applied to a bunch of CUNYs plus the CCs. Right now they\u2019re leaning towards CCs at BMCC or Kingsborough because they think if they do well they\u2019ll have a shot at transferring to NYU+ caliber schools. But they\u2019re not opposed to staying within the CUNY system for undergrad.\n\nThey also want to go to grad school in math or stats.\n\nQuestion #1: Anyone broken into quantitative trading or research position starting off at CUNY?\n\nQuestion #2: Anyone gotten into strong math or stats grad school programs starting off at CUNY?",

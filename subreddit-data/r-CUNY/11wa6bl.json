Has anyone done this before dropping all your classes in the semester(but not dropping out)? I've received my fafsa refund when the spring semester started. Does anyone know how this will affect my financial aid or anything...",

If you end up dropping and you receive TAP you will be ineligible for tap for the following semester (Fall 2024). Not saying just do it or don\u2019t do it, but be aware it will impact you beyond the current moment",

My tuition is covered by fafsa and they said since it was already processed and it\u2019s so late in the semester that I wouldn\u2019t owe anything. Maybe I got lucky idk I go to Baruch. Please go to your financial aid office and see what they say.",

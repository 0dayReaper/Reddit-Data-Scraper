    "postText": "Hello, would any of you guys mind explaining how our college schedule will look like? Is it the same as high school where we have to take the same classes for five days. What\u2019s the minimum amount of classes can we take? As someone who might want to attend clubs, are there sometimes clubs that overlaps with our class time? When do we start picking out classes? Also, do we have to take a specific class for both semester, or do we get the chance to change our class for each semester? (It\u2019s probably a dumb question, but I\u2019m just asking because in HS we have to take a specific class for the whole year).",

No. Classes take place once (3 hours) or twice (1.5 hours) a week. \n2. 12 credits (about 3-4 classes) is enough to be considered a full-time student, anything less is part-time. \n3. Depends on the club. Most club meetings take place during your campus\u2019 free hour (if you have one) or in the late afternoon/evening. \n4. Course registration has already started.\n5. You change classes each semester.",

            "comment": "&gt;Is it the same as high school where we have to take the same classes for five days?\r\n\nYou\u2019ll likely only have 4 days of classes instead of 5 (depending on your major). Most classes are scheduled for Monday-Thursday, there aren\u2019t as many classes available to take on a Friday and usually the classes that are available on Fridays are like science labs. So, you may not even have any classes on a Friday ever. I got through my whole four years never taking any classes on a Friday. If you take 4 classes, you\u2019ll probably only have 2 classes each day (same classes Monday/Wednesday and same classes Tuesday/Thursday). Sometimes it\u2019s different, some classes might meet 3 times a week (but those classes will be shorter). It varies a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What\u2019s the minimum amount of classes can we take?\r\n\nYou can take as few as one class if you\u2019re paying out-of-pocket. If you want financial aid, you need to be taking at least 12 credits per semester (which is typically 4 classes). \r  \n\r\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;As someone who might want to attend clubs, are there sometimes clubs that overlaps with our class time?\r\n\nClubs try to schedule their meeting times during club hours. There will be certain days of the week where there are no classes scheduled between certain hours (it\u2019s usually about 2 hours), allowing students time to attend club meetings. It can vary from college to college, but most clubs will try to meet at those times. Sometimes clubs meet outside of those hours, but it\u2019ll usually either be on a Friday \\[when most people don\u2019t have classes anyways\\] or it will be in the evenings. But most pretty much meet during those club hours and so it won\u2019t overlap with classes.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n&gt;When do we start picking out classes?\r\n\nYou can pick classes as soon as you discuss it with an advisor. In your first semester, you have to speak with an advisor in order to register for courses. After your first semester, then it\u2019s optional whether you want to consult with an advisor or just choose on your own. But it\u2019s usually required for your first semester. \r  \n\r  \n\n\n&gt;Do we have to take a specific class for both semester, or do we get the chance to change our class for each semester?\r\n\nEvery semester, you will pick a new set of classes to take. Sometimes you might have to take a class that has 2-parts that span across two semesters. For example, Baruch is one of the CUNY schools that make you take a language, and you need two semesters of language. So, you\u2019ll have to take the same language for two semesters. Same goes for some other courses, like a Capstone course might span across two semesters.",

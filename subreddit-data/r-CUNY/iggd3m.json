    "postText": "Tomorrow indeed is the first day of class, I want to start off by saying that you will all do great this semester. I know many aren't looking forward to it but trust me when I say we will all get through it together. In this semester we will prove that no matter what is thrown at us we can survive and continue to focus not just on our studies but our daily lives. We will focus and work hard, and in the end we will all make it. I want all my Kings &amp; Queens to keep their heads up through this semester and beyond. Never falter and lose hope, for we will endure these hardships before us\n\nCreds to @Kestrel (Ariel) Head admin of The New York City College of Technology Server",

Which CUNY that you know of or are in has a lot of online classes available? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be doing e permit as my financial aid advisor said it could mess with my aid.",

            "comment": "Honestly all of cuny is shifting or has shifted back already to being back to in person really. You could do an e-permit but 12 credits minimum would have to be taken at your home college otherwise you would have to wait until after you get your grades transferred back from I\u2019ve been told and had to do. You can go to global search cuny and see what mode of teaching other CUNY schools are doing if they offer your major. The only cuny school doing online   really is School of Professional Studies they are a fully online cuny school.",

You can check here to see if your major is offered or there is one you want to major in.   \nhttps://sps.cuny.edu/academics/undergraduate. Being   as it\u2019s cuny you will be able to transfer with no credits loss.",

If it\u2019s the same major you currently have Brooklyn college then it wouldn\u2019t make any sense since you would just need 1 class left to earn your associates.

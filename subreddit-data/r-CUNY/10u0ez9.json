I\u2019m somewhat near graduating (two semester at most), so I was wondering how weird it would be to just drop in and say hi and tell them how I enjoyed their class while we were in the pandemic? At QCC btw.",

When Hunter made us go back in person the spring 2022 semester, I popped up at her office and she was so excited to see me. We took pictures and she gave me a hug and even cried that me and my other classmates came looking for her. She had made a huge impact on our lives!",

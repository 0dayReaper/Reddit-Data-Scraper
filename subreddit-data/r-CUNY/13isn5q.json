She's much more into theory and criticism -- the academics.\n\nAny suggestions on which campus has the best program here, if any? This wouldn't be graduate, just undergrad. Thanks!",

Of course she'll still have to take a couple production courses but yeah, it's solid. I was accepted there but ultimately chose to go elsewhere and study accounting. I might double back someday.",

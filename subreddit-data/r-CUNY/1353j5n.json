But I did a get \u201ccongratulations\u201d email with \u201ckey activities\u201d that I need to do and this test is on here. So my question is\u2026why are they giving this test?(The purpose)  Does everyone take it? And what are some sources that could help me study to take this test? (Sample tests maybe would be helpful) Thank you everyone!",

This is part of the CUNY Placement Test. You can do a Google search for practice material. If you fail they will start you at remedial level classes that are non-credit. Everyone has to take College Algebra as part of the core curriculum. After that based on your major you take the next level of classes ex. statistics, calculus, etc. If you're concerned see if they have a workshop that you can take to prepare. I know KCC had one during the summer a couple years ago because so many COVID H.S. students were failing the placement exams. I think students that took College level courses maybe exempt from the placement exam.",

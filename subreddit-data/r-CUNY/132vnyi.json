But yet, you take a basic English course and there are maybe eight options for it? \n\nEvery course in all CUNYs (even major specific ones) need to have at least six to eight sections for them. Many could also use more Hybrid or remote options.",

Those \"basic\" courses have so many sections because everyone needs them and they're usually 100 or 200 level. It makes sense that there's so many options for those. I study forensic accounting and while i would love to have different options, it makes less sense for one of my classes to have 6 sections. There's only 2 sections for one of my req classes this semester, there's a combined 20 of us out of 48.",

(&amp; how/who gets hired, how/who gets promoted, tenure, etc) \nThere will never be enough advanced courses, anything that\u2019s not the basic Gen. Ed. Some critical major courses-you\u2019ll only ever see 1 per semester. \nSimply put-CUNY ain\u2019t investing in it. If they do, they are cheap &amp; hire adjuncts to teach advanced courses. FYI-adjuncts get paid the worst but do the most work. \n\nI know an adjunct who got the full time prof job. He\u2019s grossly overworked. Despite always being politically smart, even he complained about the insanity of what he was going through. 7 courses per semester + his research cause there\u2019s no adjuncts being hired. But they can be hired, just not the decision made",

For CCNY, ORGO for a lot of sci majors only gets offered once a year. Or the other option is take it with the douchebag who teaches and fails on purpose. \n\nMy pro tip, and let\u2019s pretend this isn\u2019t coming from me- you befriend the Dean &amp; get them to open the courses. They CAN, they choose not to. For our CCNY Grove, you fight for the most imp classes. If you don\u2019t, your 4 year education becomes 5 years. \n\nOr politely ask the professor/Dean to override class limits &amp; put you in. Rarely anyone does that",

Are you going to rally for CUNY at Albany?\n\nWhat's that? Oh you do none of these.

Directly after orientation they transferred me to a different zoom room and my advisor was there. So I think that\u2019s what would happen in your case as a new student. Moving forward though, you\u2019ll have to set up an account on Starfish (ask for the link when you have the initial meeting with an advisor) and that\u2019s how you\u2019ll make your appointments with advisors, professors, etc.",

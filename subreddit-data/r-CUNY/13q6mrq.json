Based on experience, there are some classes that do not give you college credits while others may, some schools may transfer the credits over if you have a C and above (I may be wrong as it\u2019s been 8 years since I had College Now in high school). I had College Now in Brooklyn College so they kept the credits after I completed the course in 2015 and let me transfer them when I started at BMCC in 2018, and kept them as classes taken when enrolling in BC in 2020",

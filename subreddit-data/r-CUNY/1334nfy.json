I would advise to submit all coursework and go to tutoring as needed as you want to only take a class once and have high grades as well. Good luck, feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Also check out a graduation degree plan to see what courses you need and speak with an advisor to see if there are any courses you can take that may count for a double section allowing you to take one less course. If you want to try it out at the minimum take five courses and you\u2019ll be good.",

    "postText": "Hi, this is my first time posting on reddit so my apologies if this isn't the correct sub/format. I've also posted in the Baruch sub.\n\nSo after taking a moderate break from school I will be returning in the fall; I've recently been accepted to Baruch and Bmcc. My end goal is Marketing Analytics, and in order to get into the Zicklin School of Business I must take Pre-Calculus at Baruch as I cannot e-permit it. I was at a four-year school prior to this but have never taken calculus/precalc and I'm pretty bad at math to be honest.\n\nDo you guys suggest I transfer to BMCC and try to get my pre-reqs done there and \\*then\\* reapply to Baruch, or just thug it out and see if I can manage to pass PreCalc at Baruch? Tbh the calculus horror stories have me shaken up and I just don't know what to do. I appreciate all help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I'm scared of taking precalc/calculus at Baruch so I'm considering deferring to BMCC for a semester or two.",

People taking harder class than precalc. Precalc is nothing when you start taking Stats and more high level courses in your upcoming years.  SO go to Baruch and sorround yourself with smart people cause Baruch has best MATH department  than any other CUNY and Some SUNY as well. MTH professors at baruch are best even tho MTH is the hardest major in this college",

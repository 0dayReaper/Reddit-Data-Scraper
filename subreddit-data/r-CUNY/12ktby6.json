    "postText": " This Second Chance Month we\u2019re joining our partners at the CUNY School of Professional Studies\u00a0and John Jay College Institute for Justice and Opportunity\u00a0in celebrating the launch of Unlocking Employment: How to Partner with Job Seekers Impacted by the Legal System. This free e-learning course was created for workforce development providers to realize our shared commitment to improving economic outcomes for New Yorkers involved in the criminal legal system.  \n\n\nUnlocking Employment focuses on upstream public safety solutions that reduce recidivism through connecting New Yorkers to jobs, training and services, and builds capacity in New York City's workforce development system to better serve low-income jobseekers. Our goal is transforming the workforce development system by reaching staff across the entire provider community.

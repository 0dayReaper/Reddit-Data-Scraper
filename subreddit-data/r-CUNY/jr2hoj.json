Add it up: dare I say that it's more than you may realize. If a bunch of this otherwise unused time goes toward your schooling (instead of taking that time to complain on reddit about your so called \"lack of time\"), you may have more FREE TIME than you'd think.... But remember this: if you are taking MORE credits (but in four 4 credit classes instead of five 3 credit classes as a quick example), the new situation would be that you would have fewer CLASSES (5 vs 4) but you'd actually be taking MORE CREDITS (16 vs 15) and as such, you should expect to do MORE WORK in a given semester to earn that additional 16th credit vs taking 15 credits....",

I assume that you are aware that if you are working (full time) that you should NOT be a full time student (in fact, certain schools, like Rutgers Law School, mandate that their students who attend DAY classes work no more than 20 hours per week on ANY job). While I don't know your SPECIFIC situation, I still have the ability to generalize from the lives of others.\n\nAs for the pandemic (or should I say 'dem panic' because it has been mostly DEMOCRATS who have been stoking fear of this INVISIBLE ENEMY called 'COVID-19' that you really can NOT fight because it is an enemy that YOU CAN NOT SEE), this country should have been saying to it \"DAMN THE VIRUS -- FULL SPEED AHEAD\". This is MY philosophy (despite my physical limitations which include problems breathing under a mask)-- I don't let the virus (or fear of it) stop me from doing what I have to do in order to survive: I hope that (THE FEAR of) the virus hasn't made you feel otherwise -- because how can we make America GREAT (and you know that it IS NOT) as long as we shut down our K - 12 schools because of some artificial '3%' number? After all, the '3%ers' ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three\\_Percenters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Percenters)) are supposedly a \"FAR RIGHT\" group (while Mayor De Blasio is anything but a right winger).... \n\nWhat we should be doing is getting HIM out of office (never mind Gov. Cuomo) ASAP (and replacing him with someone who is more willing to let the people of NYC BE the people of NYC without government telling them what to do by mask mandates, etc.). I say that we are heading towards TOTALITARIANISM under the guise of \"promoting public health\" -- THIS is what you should be worrying about instead blinding yourself inside your online textbooks to what is going on in THE REAL WORLD. And perhaps it is someone like myself (who is RETIRED, and as such has more ability to SEE what is going on around him) that SHOULD be more of a spokesperson for WE THE PEOPLE (not just of NYC, but the US as well) than those who are apparently hiding themselves under their masks both literally and figuratively.....",

Even when I was commuting from my former residence (Howard Beach, Queens NY) to Rutgers University -- Newark (via PATH and NYC Subway) in pursuit of an MBA in Marketing, it was impossible for me to even READ a textbook on a moving subway / PATH train (1979 - 1981: a time long before IPADS, etc. -- an era when we still had PHYSICAL textbooks to carry with us to class on a trip that took around 1.5  -  2 hours each way) in order to study or do school work on a train. I can't imagine trying to balance a computer, etc. on my lap and do ANYTHING (because to do that must be as at least as hard as balancing an old fashioned textbook). Therefore, I maybe \"out of touch\" (in your words), but I still have valid comparisons to \"the good old days\" which would make in-transit studying rather difficult (and no, I have NEVER been diagnosed with ADHD -- I just need a non moving seat and minimal distractions in order to properly study, do homework, or even respond to a REDDIT POST like yours).... \n\nAnd my main and FINAL point is that those NON-TRANSIT hours (that simply logging in to class instead travelling to it can save you) can literally BE your studying time for your classes. As someone who is ACTUALLY taking several classes this semester (Fall 2020 -- at Queensborough Community College as a Senior Citizen auditor who is actually DOING THE WORK and contributing to those classes), I am more \"IN TOUCH\" with such things than you'd dare think....",

You\u2019ve got all sorts of weird assumptions, I haven\u2019t accused you of having adhd nor do I care if you do. It\u2019s not relevant that in 1979 they used textbooks, and it\u2019s a little hilarious to me that you think people couldn\u2019t put a book on their lap. I\u2019ve seen hundreds of people reading newspapers open on the train, if you have too much carsickness to do it yourself I also don\u2019t see how that\u2019s relevant - sucks for you, but that doesn\u2019t represent most people. And I used to read articles and textbooks on my phone and even write notes on it too. It\u2019s really not that hard, who knows why you\u2019re acting so dramatic about it. And CAPITALIZING random WORDS to sound as though you have anything interesting to SAY. And how stupid to act as though you\u2019re special for taking classes - we literally all are if we\u2019re in this thread lol. We\u2019re all actually doing the work. I have plenty more to say on the realities of living in this pandemic for people who aren\u2019t retired and taking classes for funsies but since you clearly don\u2019t care about discussion, just about getting on your high horse I\u2019ll leave you with this - \n\nIt\u2019s clear you think you\u2019re better than everyone, but literally every single person who read your message sees what you really are.

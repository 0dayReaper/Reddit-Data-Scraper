Yes booster shots will help but the whole plan and goal of having a 70% in person classes when we are hitting new Covid Case milestones is ridiculous. Most if not all private schools in the city are adapting and changing their courses online but leave it to CUNY to put us at risk of exposure.",

While all the private colleges moved their finals online, CUNY mostly refused to do so. A friend who's double vaccinated and boosted is pretty sure caught covid during her bio final at hunter. The students begged for the exam to be moved online, but the department refused. The auditorium was packed and they even had to escort out a student who wouldn't stop coughing. My friend is ok, but she was still in bed with flu-like symptoms for a week despite the triple jab.",

Additionally, omicron is milder, unless someone is immunocompromised, we are all just better off catching it, it's just a matter of time; everyone I know who has had a booster ended up catching it anyway.",

When I first registered at BMCC I had to show proof of vax to be allowed to go to school. This was 3 years before covid.  The booster keeps you safe from new variants, such as omicron.  You can be boosted and still catch covid. But, if you are boosted and catch covid, you probably are not going to the hospital with life threatening reactions.\n\nAlso, getting an education is something great. I would just hope it leads to a smarter community.",

Back when the first vaccine requirements were put in people were furious with the thought of having to do that just to be on campus, but they did it anyways because they valued being on campus more than either losing their chance to continue their degree or losing their chance to not be in person if the class would allow for it. \n\nIt's not like the intial 70% figure for inperson classes came out of nowhere. So many students aregued to the tooth with CUNY to return back to classes because \"things got better\" and so forth. \n\nAlso have to acknowledge that it is probably easier to do huge administrative shifts such as changing class modalities in private schools versus public schools like the CUNY ones. \n\nRegardless, these times are difficult for everyone and it must be known that both sides of returning to schopl or staying online are being argued by students/families/stakeholders on a continuous basis. Just take a look at the past posts on this sub-reddit alone. You can see the yo-yo of sentiments from people who believe these changes are good or who believe they're bad and must change.",

Having an associates in todays age is like having a high school diploma. \n\nYou\u2019re better off searching for free certifications such as (Google, Coursera) or studying for the CompTIA exams (A+, Networks+, Security+, Pentest+) \n\nAs a CompTIA graduate you can earn between 50-80K +\u2026It depends on your knowledge and the type of certificate you get. #TheMoreTheBetter",

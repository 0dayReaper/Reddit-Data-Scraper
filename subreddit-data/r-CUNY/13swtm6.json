Although Rate My Professor cannot always be reliable, it does help in regard to knowing the type of graders professors may be and can help you prepare for the potential coursework you may receive from said professor. To get your GPA higher, you would need to get a B or higher (ideally an A) in about 3 out of 4 classes if you are going Full Term however no lower than B- in that fourth class (roughly about an 80) in order to maintain a 3.0",

    "postText": "Just a quick question: I've been accepted into CCNY, albeit not in my program of choice. I'm pursuing a CS degree, but I'm transferring from a SUNY CC upstate. According to my understanding, it's because I don't meet the credit transfer requirements. Is this a normal occurrence? I just want to double check before I accept offer.\n\nThanks for your time :)\n\nEdit: I was given the option to declare my major as \"undeclared\" if I choose to continue pursuing the degree; which I plan to.",

            "comment": "Well yes if one of the eligibility criteria is to have a certain amount of credits and you don\u2019t meet that criteria it\u2019s normal and justifiable for them to do that. Also you applied to the Grove School division which is very competitive and rigorous. A lot of students who  get into ccny but not for any grove school majors either for your reason or not having taken the required classes which is the common reason needed for transfers and/or freshman etc come in undeclared and complete the requirements they are lacking and reapply so I definitely recommend doing that if you plan on accepting the admission offer. I had one friend transfer after gaining her associates she didn\u2019t get in for a math requirement she completed it and applied again while in the school as undeclared and got in. I have another friend who decided to change majors at ccny and the grove school does not make any exceptions between transfers from different schools and transfers from one ccny program into the grove and she completed all her requirements reapplied and got in. So I\u2019m giving examples to show it\u2019s common to not get in on the first try but come in undeclared take the classes and/or credits needed , make sure you meet all the eligibility requirements and apply again !",

You\u2019re not missing any pre-requisites ? If not then that\u2019s really good. Even though you\u2019ll be undeclared an advisor can help you with what classes to take for the cs major.",

I had a ~2.0 gpa compared to my current GPA at cc, a 3.87. I think my cum GPA might be about a 2.65 so ill probably have to raise that a bit as well. The min GPA for Grove is a 2.8 I believe, so 2 semesters of straight As might bump me up a bit. Either way, I think I'll be happy with my choice at CCNY.  Thanks! I'll definitely talk to a CCNY advisor.",

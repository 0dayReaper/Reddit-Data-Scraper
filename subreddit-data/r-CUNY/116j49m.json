    "postText": "I plan on transferring into a 4 year but I want to take a year off in 2025, and I was wondering if it would just be better for me to finish my associates (early) or take a gap year and come back to finish my courses. (I start in Fall 2023 so it wouldn\u2019t line up with the beginning of 2025) I\u2019m guessing I\u2019d have to take summer courses to graduate earlier? I\u2019m interested if this is actually possible at a CC because I know for example City College allows up to a 12 month leave but that\u2019s a 4 year school. I appreciate any advice as I\u2019m lost on what to do.",

    "postText": "Hi! So I got an email from an actually cuny email like the ones we have \u2014\u2014.\u2014\u2014@stu.Bmcc.cuny.edu. I was worried and skeptical . The email basically said that this person was looking for anybody that wants to work part time and remote &amp; if so to email to the head of HR your resume. For starters the email of said person states that it\u2019s an outlook email (personal) and it says that he\u2019s the HR recruitment person for the WHO foundation. He explains that the job is fairly easy maybe 8-10 hours a week \ud83d\ude10 &amp; that all one has to do is help distribute money to specific shelters or non profits organizations . Personally that looked VERY real to me and not fishy . However right after wards literally the next day we got an email from the school about scam job postings &amp; that kinda got me thinking . Was wondering if anybody else got it ?",

    "postText": "I applied to a few CUNY CC's a few weeks ago, and I wanted to know generally how long it takes to hear back. I applied for this fall. I'm sort of a transfer because I dropped out of a 4-year this Spring and I'm trying to go to BMCC this fall. How long after everything is in do they evaluate transcripts/send a decision? Does my application being past the official deadline affect anything?",

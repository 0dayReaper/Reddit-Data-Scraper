Are you aware of the CC recruitment by many schools like NYU and Columbia? Are you a member of BMCC Honors? There are scholarships and grants for honors and PTK members at CC. Lehman is a great school for CS so is CCNY but you should consider looking into the CC agreement I mentioned.",

You can ask questions and speak to a recruiter directly. I am deferring for 1 year because I want to take time to look for free money. PTK also does virtual open houses and sends you information on the scholarships. You worked hard these past 2 years so let yourself be rewarded.",

Second I did some research and Lehman only accepts 38% of students every year so that mean people will still get rejected. Third I am not trying to show off my gpa I just wanted to ask a question and get some answers.",

Their minimum transfer requirement for those who obtained an associates degree is a 2.0 gpa and 2.3 gpa for those without but have more than 24 credits. With a near 4.0 gpa and being a student from CUNY, there's pretty much a 0% chance they would reject you. On the off chance they did, a quick appeal would get you in.",

    "postText": "Hi, so I have committed to bmcc and also registered for classes this fall. Can i still apply to ASAP and is it worth it ? Because my tuition and everything is coverd by financial aid and TAP. Please let me know that if i can still apply and is it worth applying and will it have any affect on my financial aid? \nAnother thing I registered for classes last Friday but still didn't receive any email for my cuny email account and my student ID ? How long does it take to get cuny email and student ID? \nThanks for your help!!",

            "comment": "Won't effect financial aid. If you somehow lose financial aid they'll pay your tuition so you're covered regardless. You can still apply for it i applied and got in literally a week before classes started. It's absolutely worth it. Textbook stipend, free metrocard, bunch of job/life/academic events and other free stuff. There's no downside to joining. As for the other thing, you mean the bmcc email? Give it some time they SHOULD tell you soon since you've already enrolled in a class.",

If you\u2019re accepted, you\u2019ll gain access to a dedicated advisor through graduation. Receive financial supports, such as MetroCards and textbooks. If you end up having a gap in your tuition and fees down the line, the program covers the difference and will support you with winter and summer tuition coverage, to ensure that you graduate within 2-3 years. Can also assist you with transferring to senior colleges once you\u2019ve earned your degree.",

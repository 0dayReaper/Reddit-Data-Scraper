However, there\u2019s another consideration. According to CUNY Transfer Explorer, ACC 222 at BMCC will transfer into Baruch as BUS 7500, which is a generic Business Administration Credit. If you want it to satisfy ACC 2101, you may want to confirm with Baruch first.",

And yes that would be the only class I would be taking in the summer, I guess my question is can I register for classes in different schools at the same time",

Other schools do send a digital copy and the physical comes in the mail. When I graduated from BMCC that was my case it definitely took time to get the physical copy about 6 months but I stayed on top of the registar office the whole time.",

But you should've received some kind of email telling you whether you need to physically go and pick it up or if it should have been mailed to you. If it's been this long, then you need to contact the college and ask them about it.",

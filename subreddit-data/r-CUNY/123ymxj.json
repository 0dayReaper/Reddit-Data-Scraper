I\u2019ve noticed that CUNY doesn\u2019t really seem to send out emails when we accept or submit things \ud83d\ude05",

In your senior year, you are only allowed to choose one school for Macaulay. For instance, I chose Hunter for Macaulay. You don\u2019t have to pay for tuition if accepted. Also, I've heard that you get a free MacBook and first-day registration privileges. Also, you have the choice to dorm for free. Additionally, Macaulay is known for providing its students with pretty good internship opportunities. Students will likely receive two graduations, one for Macaulay and one for the CUNY from which they are graduating. Some Macaulay students attend institutions such as Hunter, Queens, Baruch, City, etc. If you\u2019re attending a four year CUNY school, you might also have some Macaulay students as well. I strongly advise anyone in your family who is a junior to consider in applying for Macaulay. I'm on the waitlist, but it\u2019s an incredible opportunity.",

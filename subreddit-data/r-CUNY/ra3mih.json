I go to Hunter, and it looks like they actually did apply it to my Spring dues\u2026 \n\nI panicked and signed that to-do list item granting permission for CUNY to use it for the fall. I thought it would be fine since I didn\u2019t owe anything for this semester, but nope! My \u2018Future Due\u2019 charges decreased by the grant amount, and my grant was never refunded\u2014 only appears once as a payment. \n\nIt sucks because I was really counting on this money for the holiday season (and my financial aid + loan fully cover the spring semester anyway), but I have no energy left to fight them on this. Financial aid is absolutely always a pain in the ass for me.",

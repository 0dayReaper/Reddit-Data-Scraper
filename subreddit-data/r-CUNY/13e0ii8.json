    "postText": "So as the title says I am considering attending Hunter College to get my Masters in Social Work. I have been told that the program is really good and I have found that it's significantly less expensive than most other schools. However I have been seeing on social media recently that Hunters buildings are falling apart, bad experiences with professors and the people who tell me the MSW program is good went there long ago so I wanted to make sure the program is as good as they are making out to be.\nDo you guys have any advice or knowledge that may help make my decision. Thank you in advance.",

I can\u2019t speak about the professors. \n\nIt is true that the buildings are in desperate need of a renovation, the situation has more to do with the age of the buildings then lack of funding. In order to renovate they would need to close the building for a number of years. I do know they are working on a plan to renovate parts of the building at a time.",

Its not, because it's a public  school, cheap tuition and a high quality program it attracts many applicants. The program is highly competitive and carries an acceptance rate of 10-15% roughly. Good luck!",

    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what happened is that when I submitted my NYS Tap application, it let me download parent #1 Signature page. My parents don't have other ID so they have to sign it that way. Parent #1's consent form downloaded fine. But then it wouldn't let me download parent #2's signature page. It blanked out, and it wouldn't let me download it. I clicked Paren #2's signature page multiple times, but it wouldn't work. The page just assumed that I had downloaded Parent #2's consent form. Did anyone else have this happen to them? And How did you fix it?",

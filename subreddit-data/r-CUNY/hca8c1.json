Maybe by the spring semester there could be a vaccine or they could have better ways of navigating  the campus or something but the fall semester will be a shit show if they open up in full again. \n\nAside from the fact that CUNY is facing MASSIVE BUDGET CUTS and will definitely not be able to afford to install safety meanders properly(I don\u2019t trust them to do it properly anyway after they handled shutting down campuses), is everyone else forgetting about what they expect to happen in the fall? Since the beginning of this pandemic how many times have you heard \u201cit\u2019s coming back harder in the fall\u201d?",

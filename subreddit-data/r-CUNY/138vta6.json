West 59 Street and 11 Avenue have entrances leading you straight into the New Building. Be on top of your syllabus, it gives the entire breakdown of what professors will make you do and what type of lessons you'll learn. Don't stress, as a graduating senior I can tell you for a fact that it's going to be an experience being at John Jay College. Courses and challenging assignments are just temporary moments in college but it'll be over in no time \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

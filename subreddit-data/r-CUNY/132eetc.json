Anybody can make a post on RMP even without having taken the class. \n\nCUNY does care about student evaluations, though. The metrics of student evaluations go into files that each chair has to consider when appointing professors every year or for promotion purposes. The problem is that because they are voluntary most students don\u2019t fill them out. My advice: take your student evaluation seriously and let the administration know that this professor is not good at their job.\n\nOther than by filling out student evaluations, students don\u2019t generally have a say in who gets to teach and what kind of teaching styles should be privileged over others. Plus, they are anonymous, and they take like 5 minutes to complete. I say, fill those out and be as explicit as you can about what you hated from this class.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you are going through this, but the semester is almost over !!!

The only way they would is if you got a group of students to come with you and agree with you. They think everything is on you, even tho imo, the tuition we pay doesn\u2019t just hold ourselves accountable, but the people who serve us as well(administration, professors, tutors, literally everyone else almost). It\u2019s like buying a product on Amazon, and then getting a bad product or a good product(usually you would want a good product)",

Usually the professor teaches dozens- hundreds of kids a semester and maybe they have only 10 reviews in the years they thought.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to leave end of semester reviews.  Idk how CUNY is doing it in the last few years bc I transferred out but the school I\u2019m at now they force you to do it.  If you don\u2019t do it within a certain time frame it locks you out you can\u2019t submit assignments, view grades etc.",

            "comment": "Here's the political answer which would explain everything about terrible professors, terrible teaching, and the worthlessness of poor reviews: \n\nMost professors are tenured, meaning they can do just about anything and never get fired. Teaching is the last priority, whereas research and outside demands is first. Think of it this way: you're a professor where research defines your reputation and any external work. Teaching is nothing. What's the priority? \n\nWhen it comes to adjunct lecturers, CUNYs are dirt cheap when it comes to hiring them. I don't even think they make more than $1-3k per course per semester. Yet, they do the most grunt work without TAs. Grading, teaching, planning, office hours while trying to finish their PhD.\n\nTerrible reviews does nothing to take professors down. There are ways to take horrible professors down, but I only tell people when really terrible professors commit the worst shit possible. Rate my professor is the tool that informs students so they make educated decisions, but that's it. There's barely oversight over that site.",

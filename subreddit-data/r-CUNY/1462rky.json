    "postText": "Hey I applied as an international student from Germany with a gpa of 3.7 and 2 letters of recommendation. I got rejected from hunter (maybe bc of too much applicants who went in with an undeclared major just like I intended) but I got into Brooklyn college. I applied to Baruch intending majoring in international business what are my chances of getting in ?",

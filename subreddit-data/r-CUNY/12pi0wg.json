I'm assuming, so let me know if I'm wrong.) \n\nLook for advisors of departments you're interested in. For instance, interested in psychology? There's a psychology chair. Robert Melara at CCNY. Incredibly nice person. Not a dickhead. Interested  in political science? There's a political science chair. Daniel DiSalvo at CCNY, meh personality. Maybe he's changed. Meet em all if you want. Nothing is better than a head start. \n\nHowever, emailing may not get you somewhere. You could visit CCNY as a guest visitor to meet them. FYI - security are almost all men and are very accommodating. A little too friendly lol, you may want to say you're in a rush to avoid conversations \n\nI do not recommend talking to more generic advisors (aka the science degree advisors vs liberal arts degree advisors) BECAUSE they will ignore you as a student who's committed but not attending. They'll literally tell you to chill out.. um yeah, please don't chill out. CCNY is just like a political corporation. You need to know how it works before getting in or else you get lost and then college life sucks. \n\nAs for clubs and student life, check out the dorms. The dorms are so-so because multiple CUNYs share the building but if you want that type of dorm life, you gotta try. For clubs, google CCNY clubs and leaders. Those students are way more available for talking cause they're students, depends on personality ofc\n\nDM me if you got questions",

Because it's a team of 4 staff helping max of 100 honors&amp;macaulay students. \n\nBut if you're not in these CCNY programs, you're 1 amongst 1000s trying to get advising. So while you may be assigned an advisor, you would be assigned at the same time as everyone else to a handful of advisors. You'd be lining up to get seen. So what I always suggest to students at CCNY and any CUNY is to proactively pursue things for yourself including advising. \n\nThat's how it'll end up being at CCNY. Sometimes, there are 0 reminders about anything. 0 information told to you about how courses work, scheduling, etc. So you gotta proactively seek information for yourself. (It's super different from high school.)\n\nStart early. Advocate for yourself. \n\n(No faculty will ever tell you this unless they're honest. College life = you fight for yourself.) \n\nI was in honors, so I got advising anytime of the day. But it still didn't mean I found out how the system works from the advisor. Had to find out through experiences!\n\nIt's overwhelming, I know. It took me until my last year of college to fully understand how CCNY worked lol. Hence why I'm on Reddit sharing advice and how the system works.",

What I did in 5 years was always pop in to see a professor, lol. (You can find their buildings &amp; offices via google searches.) I had my stalking radar on but like I said, they're not going to help you like in HS. You really gotta do it all on your own. \n\nGrove is a different beast, but not impossible to maneuver. They're significantly tougher than other divisions. If you want an advisor from CS before getting into Grove, your very best bet is to figure out what part of CS you may like, find a professor doing research/work in that area, and reach out. I can help you with this. (Because the Grove advisors are douches lol, but that was built to weed out students.) \n\nYou can absolutely achieve things before even starting at CCNY, and I highly recommend this. You do NOT want to fall behind. Financial aid limits you on how long they'll cover your college schooling. It's also a terrible feeling to feel left behind. My previous friend was on TV who won 6-figures in money on a IQ show as a teenager, and he went to Brown. He got research opportunities before he even started college (research was set to start summer before college). But relatively speaking, he still did not compare to his peers at Brown so it wasn't like he got opportunities as a handout. He had to network, ask, apply. So everything is possible. Shoot for the moon\n\nIt took me 5 years to learn all this lol, and I get so upset when there isn't the right mentorship &amp; knowledgable staff for students. (FYI - I did a number of things and had over 50 mentors in my time in college. Over 10 internships, 2 full time jobs, corporate/non-profit/startup/school/healthcare/etc, 3 fellowships. I did everything you can think of lol. 20 of my mentors were from corporate.) You can always DM me. I'm happy to guide you through CCNY.",

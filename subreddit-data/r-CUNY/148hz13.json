    "postText": "Hello Hello! \n\nI'm an incoming architecture freshman and I applied to two different CUNY colleges: City Tech and CCNY. I would prefer the CCNY program but my results for ccny arent out yet. The issue with this is that I'm an international student and it would make it hard for me to wait any longer as i have to work out visa stuff. \n\nI have a few questions regarding this situation:\n\n1. What is City Tech's Architecture program really like? - I've seen so many mixed reviews about the school staff and faculty but it's mostly about the Nursing Programs or the Bio stuff. I've also seen some good stuff about the Architecture program. &lt; But all of this information is pretty outdated and I can't seem to find anyone that has been to City Tech in general.\n2. How does the school treat international students? - I heard that City Tech has a pretty chill school life but its hard making friends there as it is a commuters school. No joke i scoured #citytech and #ccny i could not find many posts with international students (maybe im looking at the wrong tags :skull:)\n3. How easy would it be to transfer back to CCNY? - While I was applying to colleges this was one of my tops schools. The big reason that I'm thinking of accepting this offer is so that I could transfer back to City College the next year. How hard would that process be?\n\nall advice and questions welcome \\^\\^",

            "comment": "So i dont go to city tech, but i do know someone who is in the architecture program. I think the program is good, but city college might be better. I say this with a bit of bias as I am transferring there from pratt. My friend who is a rising 3rd year who goes to city tech has the representation skills of a first year from pratt. Why is there a difference? I am not sure to be honest, but it seems to be a pattern with many students. Sure some students do go above and beyond what they are asked to do and it results in good work, but I think at the private schools, since people put down more money for tuition, it becomes an absolute mission to create better work than anyone else. \n\nIf you applied to architecture schools, i\u2019m sure you have heard about the \u2018name brand\u2019 schools as well. Schools like cooper, pratt, cornell, etc. the truth is, all architecture schools within new york state share the same professors/faculty. Almost all of them do or at least at one point taught at the state colleges in addition to the private schools. There are big name professors that show up at the state and city and upstate schools who are well respected in their field and also teach at other prestigious schools. \n\nI didnt get in to CCNY spitzer my first try out of high school, but i did get in 2.5 years later. Was it because of a better creative challenge or the fact i was coming from pratt? I dont the know the answer. I think i was very honest in my essay during my 2nd try. Rather than going for a poetic essay, i went for a brutally honest essay about why pratt wasnt working for me and why it was absolutely imperative that ccny take me. \n\nI dont think city tech has a formal campus, my friend goes to the long island campus. Most city college and city tech architecture students are found to be taking less than 18 credits but right above 12 credits. Students at the more pricey schools take usually 18 credits per semester. At the end of the day your work is defined by the way you manage your time, your life, and your energy towards the things you are most interested in.",

It\u2019s a great school, they have summer and winter courses, they have  internships with city/state agency to help get your foot in the door. As a matter of fact, that\u2019s how I got my current job through networking at citytech.",

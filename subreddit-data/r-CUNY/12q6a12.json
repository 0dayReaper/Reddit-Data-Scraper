            "comment": "Hey, I'm a junior rn at Macaulay CCNY! I'm not sure if your referring specifically to the Macaulay classes, but they aren't very rigorous. They can be quite fun actually and I miss the connection between my fellow Macaulay students that we had in the required sequence classes. As far as other Macaualy classes, I can't say since I haven't taken any at the actual Macaulay building, but they tend to have fun topics so be on the lookout! Honors classes are same-level as regular classes imo.\n\nYour experience is what you make of it! There are plentyyyy of events, connections, and opportunities that Macaulay provides. I'd say my only (somewhat) regret was not making the most of them, but of course it depends on the person. You specifically get emails about jobs opportunities and internships only offered to Macaulay students, as well as info and networking sessions. There are also job/career fairs in person. Plenty of clubs and events at Macaulay as well, like a spring formal, movie nights, game nights, art nights, study sessions, etc all at the Macaulay building. Can't say I've been to one, but I'm sure it's lots of fun\ud83d\ude02 you can also have most of your summer and winter session paid for, if you want to take extra classes, catch up, or finish your degree early so take advantange!! There's also the Macaulay Culture ID which gives you discounts/access to museums and stuff. Haven't used it once yet, but it's nice to have ig\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAs for Macaulay funding, there is the opportunity Fund which I'm sure you've seen something about. You can get between $1.5k to $5k depending on the type of experiential learning you're doing (internship, study abroad, or research) BUT it is work. A lot more work applying for it than I was prepared for. You have to write a well developed essay in less than 3 weeks basically. When I tell you I went through more than 6 drafts in less than 2 weeks\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d anywho, your advisor should hopefully help with that. Then there's the honors requirement for your major. Depending on your major, you need to create a project, complete a 3-semester research sequence, or do some other type of research/thesis. You also have the option of doing a 2-semester thesis through Macaulay classes. So plan ahead. I'd recommend getting it out of the way beginning early junior year. Also try to get the 30 hrs of volunteering done early so you can forget about it.\n\nFor the CCNY campus, I'd say social life isn't the biggest, but again, it all depends on what you make of it. I feel like a lot of people tend to be in and then out with classes, but there are def opportunities to get involved and everything.\n\nI will be honest--I've found that personally Macaulay can be a pain in the ass sometimes and I find myself comparing myself to my peers and the things they're accomplishing. But don't pressure yourself, we're all figuring it out step by step and it's okay to go at your own pace. I'm not as ambitious as some of my peers, and I'm okay with that! So you do you :))\n\nWoo that was a lot! Congrats on your acceptance and I hope you have a wonderful time at Macaulay and CCNY!!",

    "postText": "You first originally receive an email asking for a group interview. I\u2019ve seen a few people have questions about the interview process. I\u2019m pretty sure the interview questions vary based on the field you picked (different CUNY colleges are in charge of different fields). I applied to the healthcare field. They start with a brief overview of the program before splitting into breakout rooms. There\u2019s multiple interviewers so everyone will be put into groups of 5-6 with one of the interviewers. Camera and Mic on is an absolute must (not a good idea to ever do an interview without a cam lol). They asked pretty brief questions such as why do you want to join this program, what your future career goals are, name a time you faced conflict and how you solved it etc. I don\u2019t necessarily think it was hard as most of the questions were pretty open ended. Overall, just be yourself! They informed us that we should receive an email of whether or not we\u2019re actually accepted into the program in March. From there, we are going to attend an internship fair (i think it\u2019s virtual tho) where we meet different employers and submit our information and then we rank them all on a list based on which we\u2019d prefer the most to least. They recommend at least applying to 8!  The employers are the actual ones deciding who goes where at the end of the day considering they have to pick out of all the applicants lol.\n\nUPDATE: 3/15/2023 received official acceptance email to program after interview",

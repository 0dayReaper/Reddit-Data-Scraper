Do you think it is possible to be readmitted if I say I did it accidentally? I  am still receiving emails from Brooklyn about events and stuff.",

Then went to Queens that people always hype for how it looks, and I hated it outside of the aesthetic. Then I went to York, which everyone outside of York makes fun of, but I thought in some ways were better than the other 2, and was in no way as bad as people deemed. But if I could go back, I would\u2019ve tried Hunter, which seemed to have the best modern class choices.",

The reason why I don't want to got hunter is because  Hunter requires 4 courses of a language and  its difficult to get a seat in their science classes.  I originally choose hunter for the prestige because I want to major in psychology than get a masters in communication science an disorder at NYU . But If I do this I will have to spend my first year taking all the Pre-requesites .  However , If I go to Brooklyn college and major in communication science and disorders . I will be straight in the program . The only difference is I'm 50 percent done with my psychology degree at hunter and 32 % done with communications science degree at brooklyn .",

Hunter compared to BMCC is very rundown and outdated, it\u2019s like almost falling apart. There are a lot of water damage on the ceiling and walls, and the bathrooms are horrible, old, and doesn\u2019t have toilet seat covers, and some stalls are so small that you have to stand beside the toilet just to close the door. The soaps are horrible too, it\u2019s so diluted. The cleaners just leave the pile of trash in the hallways, and I barely see any cleaners working at Hunter compared to BMCC. Also there\u2019s a lot more students at Hunter (so it\u2019s very very crowded) but somehow they didn\u2019t think to add more classes so they don\u2019t all fill up WAY TOO early during enrollment, or make a bigger cafeteria. It\u2019s so crowded at Hunter that it\u2019s difficult to find a spot in the library, cafeteria, etc and there\u2019s always lines in bathrooms and they always smell like poop air so you\u2019re lucky if you find a clean bathroom that doesn\u2019t smell in a secluded area in campus. Also. ITS SO DAMN HOT, like they put the heaters on max so we have to open the windows in one of my classes but it always smells like weed, can\u2019t say if the food is bad because the rice at both schools are dry asf.\n\nHunter pros: its a 4-year college, students are more involved (bc most are still young and not grown adults with children and a full time job), there\u2019s a lot of clubs, sororities and fraternities, the subway station is connected to the campus, the library has so many levels, they have a lot of different types of classes so you can explore, they have amazing pizza bc it\u2019s always made fresh, there\u2019s a couple of chargers in the library and lots of outlets, there\u2019s a starbucks on campus, multiple areas to buy food from inside campus and they\u2019re still open at night, etc.",

    "postText": "I'm kinda confused. I first registered in Fall 2020, but dropped all the classes right before the first day due to the pandemic. Then I took classes in Spring 2021, and my ASAP advisor tells me I have until Fall 2023 to graduate, which is 2.5 years. I thought ASAP gives you three years to graduate, though? Did the semester prior to my first actual semester count or something or do they count 2.5 years as 3 years?",

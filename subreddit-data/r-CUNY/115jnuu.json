Queens College, for example, gives credit for many St. John's courses. Go to [this page](https://explorer.cuny.edu/noncuny) of Transfer Explorer and put in the CUNY college you're thinking of transferring to, and then click Next and follow the prompts.",

(Each college has its own policy for accepting non-CUNY credits for transfer.) \nI had credits from St John\u2019s that I earned in high school. They were accepted by Hunter but not when I was at BMCC. Some may be credited as electives, rather than count toward fulfilling core requirements, but again this depends on the variables.",

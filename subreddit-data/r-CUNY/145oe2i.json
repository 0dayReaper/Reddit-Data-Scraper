I try to search for an enrollment date on CUNYFIRST like my college's website states but there is none, and when I go on Schedule Builder it says I'm not eligible to enroll.\n\nThis was my first time ever applying for an E-Permit so sorry for my ignorance lol",

            "comment": "There are two stages of approval.  First is by your home college, which is the approval you now see. After that, it gets forwarded to the host college. They will review and approve it, which usually takes about another week (depending on the host college\u2019s processing). Once completed, you should get an email from the host college with a date window to register for the course, although it\u2019s good to also keep an eye on your enrollment dates. \nDespite the name \u201ce-permit,\u201d it\u2019s really all a manual process between the registrar offices of the two schools, so be patient. It\u2019s called \u201ce-permit\u201d because the old system required you to run from office to office getting approval signatures on a hard-copy form for submission.",

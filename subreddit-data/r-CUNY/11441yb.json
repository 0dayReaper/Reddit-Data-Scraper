I know my mistake now but i cant blame a college for not taking me. im not sure if i could do anything with the colleges who rejected me and explain my situation but either way, i was hoping someone could recommend online colleges that aren\u2019t expensive (i financially cant afford it and im completely on my own with college), if nyc community colleges are a good option, or if there is something else i should do.\n\ni just want to get back to my education. i graduated hs in june 2021. i havent been able to stay in college since  because of living situation issues but now i am stable and i just want to go. thank you to anyone who can help!!",

            "comment": "Hey, is it possible to return to the college that you initially withdrew from? Most colleges remove the F from your transcript if you retake the class and get a better grade. Just something to consider. After you finish your Associate Degree, you could then transfer to a four year college. Feel free to message me privately if you need help navigating how to get back to college and resources that might be available to help you graduate once you enroll! Good luck",

They also help you apply for assistance because let\u2019s be honest most students who are on their own are either working (most for rent) and have about $50 left for food ! Bmccs sister college is Baruch so we have a lot of Baruch professors teaching here too! Couple of other professors from John jay teach her as well! Don\u2019t be discouraged ! I love Bmcc and once you fill out fafsa you\u2019ll get into other programs as well (asap, college discovery) ect :)",

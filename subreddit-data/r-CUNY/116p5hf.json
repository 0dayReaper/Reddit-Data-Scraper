It also shows up in my Financial aid in my cuny email or cunyfirst. Also I don't think you will not be able to enroll if you owe money but that's never happened to me so i'm not sure. There are due dates to pay tuition dues i'm assuming if financial aid doesn't cover more. If you need more in depth help you would ask your bursars office. I can only talk about my experiences so I feel like i'm not the best at finding perfect solutions for you.",

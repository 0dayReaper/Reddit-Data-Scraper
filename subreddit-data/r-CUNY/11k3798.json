Meaning if you're failing classes and have a pattern of withdrawing you can lose your aid. As long as you're taking 12 credits for tap or meet the requirements for part-time tap and your aid hasn't been exhausted you should be okay. I'm not sure if your break is for Spring or Fall. Just remember aid is for the year. Fall 23 starts the new year.",

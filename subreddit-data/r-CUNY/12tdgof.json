Everyone used to take placement tests to see what level you're at but last year they were putting people in workshops over the summer in lieu of testing. Depending on your grade and the portion of the final you passed that's what level you were put in. If you passed the final you went into the next level. For me that was Statistics. You should contact the school you're going to and find out.",

    "postText": "Hi. I am a student working on a project with Community Partners, a nonprofit based in California, to compare how different campuses across the US are meeting the needs of their disabled and neurodivergent students. If you identify as such, please consider helping by answering a few questions.\n\nFeel free to reply within this thread or DM me your responses:\n\n1. Are all campus buildings physically accessible to students who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids?\n2. Digital accessibility: Are class session recordings readily available for all large lecture courses?\n3. How much time do students have between consecutively scheduled classes?\n4. Are students required to provide documentation of disability to qualify for receiving initial accommodations?\n5. What is the wait time for an initial appointment with your campus' psychological counseling services?\n6. Is there required diversity and inclusivity training for faculty/staff/and students, and does training include recognition of neurodivergence and disability?\n7. Have you experienced ableism, discrimination, or witnessed any stigmatizing language on campus or on official college publications (ex. the website)?\n8. Does your college offer a Disability Studies curriculum?\n\nThank you for your time!",

            "comment": "College: BMCC\n\n1. Yes; but that doesn't mean it's easy to navigate them. generally BMCC can be a maze if you're traversing solely by elevator. The day the main escalator was under repair was HELL.\n\n2. I go to BMCC\u2014 no large lectures but it really depends on the teacher. I know the professors that really put the extra effort into teacher have stuff from over the pandemic they publish.\n\n3. Generally, students can't schedule classes within 30 min ending from each other, at least in my experience. \n\n4. Actually experienced this one today: depends on the school but at BMCC you need a form (not a letter or report) filled out by whatever professional is treating your disability. Which takes a week to process once you give it to them, even if you have accommodations from prior institutions. which i think is a massive ugh, but i'm only a student who is suffering unjustly because of this unusual practice but whatever.\n\n5. emergency is same day, i got a random call for an initial virtual evaluation on a random Friday 2 weeks after i filled out the form. it made zero sense and I just didn't have the energy to continue trying afterwards.\n\n6. Not for students, not sure about staff.\n\n7. Surprisingly not the most ableist environment. Only a single teacher has been weird about my usage of noise-cancelling headphones, but they were understanding or at least pretended to after explanation.\n\n8. I'm in a community college, but there isn't at least by name/major pathway",

I am a chronic migraine and chronic fatigue sufferer, and autistic/ADHD\n\n1.) John Jay is physically accessible, however due to the escalators and stairs, I find it difficult to navigate easily from an accessible standpoint. \n\n2.) I have not had a large lecture, so can\u2019t answer, but all my experiences have pointed to yes. \n\n3.) I have ten minutes between class, which I feel is typical. \n\n4.) No. However, I have heard similar frustrations, but Disability Services at John Jay can be frustrating at best. Fortunately, all my professors except one have been great. \n\n5.) have not used the service \n\n7.) I have had one Professor refuse to offer me an extension due to a seizure, otherwise, everybody\u2019s been great, and the school has a whole \n\n8.) John Jay specifically does not, but I do think other CUNYs do.",

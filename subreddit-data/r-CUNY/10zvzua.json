Therefore now less people are going to CUNYS and perhaps hitting their target schools. Another theory is that enrollment was high during 2020-21 because of online classes but now it\u2019s going back in person, it\u2019s less attractive to people who are fully employed or too busy to have a full in person schedule.",

Some of my friends did not register for the current semester because there were less online-only sections than the previous semester. Some people need the online flexibility in order to get their education and graduate on time.",

CUNY cutting budget.. \n\nCampus Community\nMemorandum\nFrom: Dr. Milton Santiago, Interim VP for Administration &amp; Finance Date: February 10, 2023\nSubject: Savings Target\nAs part of a three-pronged approach to secure firmer financial footing, in December 2022 CUNY instituted a University-wide 2% reduction initiative for FY 2023, BCC\u2019s reduction target totaled $1,542,000. In response, the College submitted a reduction plan which CUNY recently approved.\nAs a result of this initiative and other endeavors, CUNY\u2019s overall structural deficit was reduced from $234 million in FY 2022 to $194 million in FY 2023.\nTo progress further towards financial stability, the University recently implemented a new savings target for FY 2024 of $100 million. This target is in addition to the $75 million target that was baselined in fiscal year 2023, for a total of $175 million for fiscal year 2024. The reduction target for BCC, after incorporating the FY 2023 initiatives, is 5.5% or $4.240 million.\nEach college must develop a Savings Plan that outlines expense reductions and revenue enhancements and describes how these targets will be achieved. While one time savings and/or revenue generating initiatives were accepted for FY 2023, they will not be considered for FY 2024. Savings Plans must contain sustainable efficiencies and/ or streams of revenues. Further, CUNY will require all Colleges to address two areas specifically in their Savings Plan; the first, relates to addressing the college\u2019s historically low student collection rates and the impact on the college\u2019s finances, and the second, an in\u2010depth analysis of adjunct costs considering the University\u2019s declining enrollment.\nThe FY 2024 Savings Plans, after appropriate consultation with elected faculty and student leaders, is due no later than Friday, March 3rd.\nAdditionally, as part of this process, effective February 3rd the University instituted a hiring freeze and re-established a centrally managed Vacancy Review Board (VRB). The VRB\u2019s purpose will be to review full-time personnel action requests across the system to consistently ensure that only critical actions are pursued. Colleges are required to establish a local version of the VRB to vet positions prior to their submission to the central VRB. BCC has just received additional guidance regarding the VRB process to be shared with the campus upon review and implementation. Of note, the 595 full-time faculty lines allocated to CUNY in FY 2023 are excluded from the VRB.",

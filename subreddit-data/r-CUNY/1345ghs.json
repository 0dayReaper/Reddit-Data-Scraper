    "postText": "Hi, I am making a very last minute pre-decision day post on which school to go to. I got into John Jay w/ Macaulay Honors but I'm not entirely sure if its good for political science. I intend on majoring in political science and one other major (leaning into forensics science or forensics psychology). However,  I don't know how refined the political science department is at John Jay and I am still considering my other option which is the University of Rochester, which I would have to pay around 8k a year. Furthermore, I also kind of want to give the natural sciences or engineering another go in college to see if I like it so U of R would be more ideal in this aspect than JJ.  I guess the last thing holding me back against committing is I don't necessarily want to stay in the city for my undergraduate haha. At the moment I intend on going to law school and I guess I just want your opinion here. Thanks!  \n\n\nadding onto this, hows the internship opportunities at John Jay for law related internships. ",

I do know the forensic psych program is one of the best if you decide to go that route. There are a shitton of internship opportunities in law related stuff(and everything else). That's not my speed but i get a million emails weekly for them(something i think you have to sign up for, i don't remember). The head of your dept should send out various opportunities in addition to that. Good luck in whatever you do wherever you go.",

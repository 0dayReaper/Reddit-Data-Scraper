I've had higher percentages than that, it just depends on how much you're quoting from other sources. The more you quote, the higher the percentage is going to be. \n\nAlso, sometimes what makes that percentage higher is that you're quoting something someone else at your college has already quoted in one of their papers, so it treats it as you copying from them rather than you copying from a source, it doesn't really know the difference. Same goes for if you described a quote in a similar way to someone else. Like, if you and another student quoted the same quote and then followed it by \"this means that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" even the \"this means that\" part will get counted towards the percentage because it's something that people commonly say after quoting something. \n\nThe professor is supposed to manually check to make sure everything was cited correctly and they're not supposed to judge it based on the percentage alone. Also, it will show the professor whether it's 'high risk' or not and if it doesn't show up as high risk, the professor likely won't even care about what the percentage is.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, so I just wanted to ask if any of you can share your experience working in career launch internships. They sent me an email saying that I am a finalist and am guaranteed a spot if I complete the upcoming steps.\n\nThe reason for asking is that I am applying to a lot of internships last few months and many of them reply back that I am not qualified enough, and stuff like that in response. Also, the only experience I have is working at Starbucks. So I feel underqualified and it makes me nervous. But I really need a real job before next year to support my parents and I don't wanna fuck this up. It already took me a little too long to graduate because of depression.\n\nSo it will be great if you guys can share what are some skills I might need to polish or might be expected to learn so I can practice them before summer. Thanks.",

            "comment": "For the business and communication sector, it really depends on what field of business you plan to work in. There is a huge difference between general business and accounting, for instance. I will work on reviewing your coursework and sharpening your Excel skills. Business is mostly about communication, so work on your communication skills as well. Don't be nervous, everyone feels this way when we first start out. This is a summer internship, to potentially land a full-time position, be sure to put in all your effort to make a lasting impression. All take into consideration that there will be a job fair soon where you will need to apply to various business positions. I would aim to apply to at least 10. My friend applied to 20 last year and she got her last choice.",

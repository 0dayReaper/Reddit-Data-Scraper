But on my cuny first it still says application incomplete can this happen because of the spring break? I am really confused. And also for fafsa I think when you make an account it takes time to review the details and then I can apply for fafsa but i never got any email from fafsa too. NEED HELP!!",

As long as you sent out all the needed materials, they're being received. I submitted mine back in January, and only got all my results by today.",

Also, I called the CUNY welcome center about my high school transcript and they said it would be waived since I graduated from kingsborough and I'm a current CUNY student, so now the waiting game begins. The good news is Baruch has received my application for the fall and I hope Brooklyn and Medgar Evers will follow suit. I want to experience different neighborhoods and meet new people. I chose John Jay, but removed it at the last second because of fear that I wouldn't be accepted.",

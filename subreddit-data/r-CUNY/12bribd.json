    "postText": "Hey everyone, I need some advice, any help would be much appreciated. \n\nLet me explain my story: \n\nI am currently a high school senior, NYU was my dream school but unfortunately I got rejected :( Nevertheless, it is still my dream school and I hope I can end up there somewhen in the near future. Im leaning towards committing to Lehman College through the SEEK program, specifically for the reason that I can apply to NYU again through HEOP, so I could possibly get a smaller applicant pool. I plan on working hard and maintaining the highest GPA possible throughout my time at CUNY if I do end up gaining the opportunity to transfer. Throughout the HS admissions process, I have definitely learned a lot about the way it works which I feel would've given me a better chance had I known previously.\n\nNOTE: (I am aware about NYU's CCTOP from BCC or BMCC but I didn't apply to any community colleges) \n\nSo now comes my questions: \n\n. Am I going down the wrong path? \n\n. Has anyone gone down a similar path? \n\n. What are the most common ways that people transfer to NYU? \n\n. Does anyone have any advice for me at all?",

            "comment": "Hi,\nJust a couple words of advice, take them as you may. \n\nFor starters getting into NYU with HEOP is a very slim chance. Your applicant pool will be filled with freshmen applicants and other transfer students and HEOP usually caters towards incoming freshmen. I\u2019d say you\u2019d have a better chance transferring into an Ivy League lol. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what your major is but the CUNY system is well rounded and most people graduate debt free. There\u2019s no point in paying for undergrad when you can get it at an affordable rate or basically free. This is coming from someone who transferred from a private school to a CUNY.\n\nI hope this helps! Feel free to message me if you have anymore questions!",

I'm taking a gap year because I'm burned out. I should also mention that I'm an honors student and PTK. So in addition to being a CC student I had those additional achievements. I think that the CC are the better option. You do 2 years graduate and transfer to a 4 year. At Senior Colleges like Lehman you're set up to do 4 years. You can transfer but I personally feel the CC are structured in a way to give you a foundation for a 4 year as opposed to SC are structured to complete your 4 years. Also take into consideration what your major will be.",

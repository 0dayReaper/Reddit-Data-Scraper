Yes, the school's facilities are run down and it is very overcrowded, but you get as much as you put in. That applies to making friends and doing well in your classes. If you don't put in any effort to meet new people, don't be surprised if you don't have many friends.",

If you want something at Hunter, you need to go and get it yourself. If you need help on your homework or want to make connections with professors you need to be proactive. The advisors aren't too helpful tbh, double check everything they tell you because if they fuck you over, it's your tuition money that goes to waste and nothing will ever happen to them. Regarding making friends, the overwhelming majority of students at Hunter are commuting to school everyday so you need to put in effort to meet people.",

Professors will not hold your hand. Administration isn't always pleasant. Your major also plays into this. STEM is hard. The reality is that so is the profession. You have to experience things yourself and block out the noise.",

I sometimes find it irritating when some of them say that it\u2019s hard to make friends, but most of them go to classes and then straight back home. You have to join clubs if you want to make some friends. From looking at your profile, you also got into Macaulay. Since you\u2019ll be required to do seminars, you\u2019ll be able to make friends there. I feel like it\u2019ll be easier for macaulay students to make friends because you\u2019ll be with them for four years.",

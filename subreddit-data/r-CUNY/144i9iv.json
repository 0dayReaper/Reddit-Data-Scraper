    "postText": "So I withdrawal from human anatomy 1 twice and received an B the third time. currently I have a C+ an 78.40 in human anatomy 2 , should I withdrawal for a better grade ? Im currently at LaGuardia and although it\u2019s not a pre req , but just in case I didn\u2019t get into there radiology program and have to transfer should I withdrawal ? I notice at other CUNY colleges some radiology program requires you to have at least a B- to get in there program in human anatomy 2 I need advice on what I should do ?",

            "comment": "Honestly, if it is not a pre-req at LaGuardia\u2019s radiology program, I would not worry about it. Perhaps withdraw if you don\u2019t want this affecting your gpa because a C+ will drop it drastically. I think GPA would be a big factor into getting into that program as well. \n\nIf you do not get into the program after multiple attempts, then I would take AP 2 at maybe another community college or your plan B school.",

            "comment": "Before you consider withdrawing, ask yourself if getting a B- is still possible. \n\nCurrently, you have a C+, which is not far from a B-. \n\nI think you can make it, but you know yourself better than anyone else.",

The program is wildly competitive these days \u2026 major influx of RT students and with there needing to be a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 and having at least a B- or higher in three key preclinical courses. You maybe waiting a while as they\u2019d prioritize other students with stronger grades \u2026..also LGCC is not accredited.",

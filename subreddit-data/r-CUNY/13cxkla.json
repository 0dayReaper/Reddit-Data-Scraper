I recommend trying to seek tutoring, and enroll into next semesters class right away. Don't take a break because then you'll forget. Try your best, get tutoring, partner with classmates, ask the professor questions and try to limit your distractions (stay away from the phone during class). Keep focused and I think you got this.\n\nPart of college is facing obstacles and figuring out a way to overcome them. I do not recommend you transferring. I wish you good luck.

            "comment": "I agree with both comments that you received. I come from a family of Healthcare Professionals and worked in Healthcare for over 20 years and at CUNY switching careers. You have to decide for yourself. What is your institution is saying? Trust your gut. I will add my experience in the field. Your science grades are important but so is actually being prepared for the dental admissions test, dental school and eventually residency if you want to specialize. I know people that couldn't get into dental and medical school because of preparation. I know someone that had to re-take a couple sciences courses they got C's in 30+ years ago trying to switch careers. Hunter has one of the most respected and recognizable health tracks in the CUNY system. Dropping a class that you had difficulty in was smart. The best thing about dropping a class is its the evil you know and you now have an advantage. Re-think transferring and consider a plan of attack. Have you considered the options recommended about tutoring and study groups or a partner? Have you thought about taking harder classes with easier classes or alone if possible? Could it have possibly been the Professor you had? Vetting professors is important because there are really bad ones. I look up every professor on RMP, ask students on reddit and do a Google search. I'm proactive when selecting my classes and sections. Think things over and make your own choices. My only advice is to mention that the path of the least resistance isn't always the best one. These classes serve as a foundation and continue to build.  Your primary goal should be preparation and not only passing.",

            "comment": "I am also on the pre-dental track and was accepted to both Baruch and Hunter. I chose Baruch because Hunter\u2019s science dept is notoriously difficult and overall Baruch seemed like a better fit. My suggestion is to try to e-permit those courses if you can. If not, there is nothing wrong with trying to transfer.\n\nKeeping your gpa and science gpa high is what\u2019s priority right now so your concerns are valid. Just because someone else has done it or would love to be in your position doesn\u2019t quite help us get into dental school. You know what works best for you so it\u2019s better to do something about it now than have your gpa affected down the line. But that\u2019s just my opinion.",

            "comment": "I would recommend transferring to Brooklyn, City, or Queens college. The science classes at Hunter are notoriously difficult, they give me nightmares just thinking about it. Finals weeks is so brutal, I\u2019ve seen countless students cry since they know that they just bombed their exams. The science courses at Hunter are designed to weed people out. Once you get past the first few introductory courses, things become a bit more manageable. Grading is more precise and there are more resources available to you. Props for you for withdrawing, I would have done the same. There are plenty of people who went to other CUNYs, sunys, and privates who ultimately get into dental school. Getting into dental school is not easy but creating extremely difficult science classes to weed people out is unfair.",

I'm planning on pursuing a CS degree and I want to eventually transfer to Baruch or Stony. Any ideas on which is the better option?",

Now, I\u2019m about to transfer to City College to complete my bachelors or hopefully Cornell University. It mostly depends on the effort you put on it, but I think LaGuardia is a good place to start. Of course, I\u2019m a little biased because I only know LaGuardia, but I can tell you is going to be fine over there. \n\nJust do your best.",

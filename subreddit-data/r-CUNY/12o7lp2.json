            "comment": "I\u2019m an undergraduate student at a cuny school wrapping up my freshman year. For most of the year I rented a room through a rental agency called Aya. Their apartments come furnished so you don\u2019t need to deal with that. However, the price point is definitely higher per bedroom than other options - for reference, I was paying ~$1500 for a room in bedstuy (got robbed there, I know\u2026) but this could be an option for you for settling into the city. As far as apartment hunting, I had luck with street easy and apartments.com when looking for my current housing. I moved in with 2 of my friends from school and we are now renting a 3 bedroom in sunset park for a total of $2750/month or $950 each. \n\n\nThe rental market can be a lot to navigate, and you will likely need a guarantor in order to sign a lease. That being said, I work 3 nights a week as a waitress and am able to afford rent, so it\u2019s definitely doable. Studios and 1 bedrooms are likely to be much more expensive than finding roommates as well. Renting a room through an agency worked well for me for my first semester in the city before I was able to find people to room with. \n\n\nYou should also check out EHS, which has a couple dorm locations, one called the New Yorker which is right by penn station and thus close to the graduate center. This isn\u2019t really much cheaper than finding an apartment, though. \n\n\nAlso, I recommend being mindful of neighborhoods as some areas of the city are much, much more expensive. Have you lived in nyc before, or is this your first time?\n\n\nFinal tip is if you go the route of renting an apartment, tour as many as possible before signing a lease. My roommates and I toured 8 places before we came back to the one we are now renting.\n\n\nGood luck, and if you have any other questions I can try to answer!",

Northern Manhattan (Harlem, Washington Heights) is much more affordable that midtown or lower, although you might find a couple rentals that are reasonably priced. Brooklyn is also generally more affordable than Manhattan; as someone who is decidedly not a city person I enjoy that Brooklyn feels a little less busy as well. I don\u2019t know much about renting in Queens or the Bronx though, although I have a couple friends who live in Astoria and really like it. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m familiar enough with the city to tell you any areas to avoid, though.",

Keep in mind in order to get an apartment in NYC, most landlords require proof of income (40x the rent, is the required amount usually), good credit and a clean background. If you do not have 40x the rent as proof of income, I highly recommend getting a guarantor or switching to getting a room.\n\nYour school is located in Manhattan, which is an insanely expensive area to live in with an average rental cost of 3,900$ per month. Are there deals available? Sure, but you would have to know someone, that knows someone. \n\nFor 1200$, you can live in the following areas and secure your own spot. Studying for a Ph.D. requires great focus and concentration and I would prefer to have my own quiet and private space. Of course that is a personal choice, your choice is up to you.\n\nJersey City (45 mins to 1 hr to Manhattan)\n\nQueens (Depending on where you are in Queens, 20 mins to 1 hour to Manhattan)\n\nBrooklyn (Again, depending on where you are, 20 mins to 1hr+)\n\nI created a craigslist search for you with the filter set to show you all apartments available within 8 miles of the cuny graduate center and 1200$ as the max limit. There are a lot of listings for rent-stabilized apartments, I would ignore those as they are likely for NY residents only that have certain criteria (disabled, low income, etc)\n\n[https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/apa?housing\\_type=1&amp;max\\_price=1200&amp;postal=10016&amp;search\\_distance=8#search=1\\~gallery\\~0\\~0](https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/apa?housing_type=1&amp;max_price=1200&amp;postal=10016&amp;search_distance=8#search=1~gallery~0~0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few examples of listings:  \n\n\n[https://newjersey.craigslist.org/apa/d/jersey-city-beautiful-bedroom-apartment/7611141119.html](https://newjersey.craigslist.org/apa/d/jersey-city-beautiful-bedroom-apartment/7611141119.html)  \n\n\n[https://newjersey.craigslist.org/apa/d/hoboken-apartment-for-rent/7610994722.html](https://newjersey.craigslist.org/apa/d/hoboken-apartment-for-rent/7610994722.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/apa/d/college-point-apartamento-dormitorio/7600759683.html](https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/apa/d/college-point-apartamento-dormitorio/7600759683.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you cannot locate an apartment you like or you dislike traveling/taking the train, your next bet is to find shared rooms in these locations:  \n\n\nAstoria Queens - 15-20 mins from Manhattan\n\nLong Island City - 15-20 mins from Manhattan\n\nSunnyside Queens - 25-30 mins from Manhattan\n\nJackson Heights Queens - 30 mins from Manhattan (Express train)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not very familiar with the neighborhood names in Brooklyn, but Brooklyn neighborhoods can also offer the same convenience of getting to Manhattan quick, but BK is generally more expensive than Queens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish you the best of luck and congratulations on your new journey!",

    "postText": "I have a GPA of 2.7 as of my graduation almost two weeks ago from Hunter with a BA in Psychology (feels so weird to type that out lol). Requirements for MHC programs and other programs I\u2019m interested offered by CUNY schools all have a requirement of a 3.0  GPA. What are my chances of getting into graduate programs without this requirement?  Would having out of this world statements of purposes and essays suffice? Because I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to get enough recommendations for all the programs I\u2019m interested in. Some ask for 3-5 others ask for 2 and I have like 2 people I could ask. I\u2019m not in a rush to apply to grad programs. Thank you to whoever replies!!",

            "comment": "It will likely depend on how many other people are applying to that graduate program. If your grad program only accepts 30 applicants and 300 apply, you likely will not be accepted if you have a GPA lower than the requirement. But if only 20 people apply you might be accepted despite not meeting the required GPA. I don\u2019t think it would hurt to apply though. Better to apply and get rejected than not apply at all and find that you could\u2019ve been accepted.",

            "comment": "I just recently got admitted into an MA program for MHC, after a few rejections, I had a 3.9 GPA, finished undergrad in 2 years flat at Baruch. Here are the tips I can offer you:\n\n1. If hunter has any research studies you can participate in, that will make you stand out instantly, it's rare to have a candidate with research experience.\n\n2. Your entrance essay should be 1 page long, and the best 1 page you ever wrote in your life. Utilize writing centers, grammarly pro, outwrite pro, clever friends, etc. I took a year to write my 1 page.\n\n3. Only get recommendations from PSY professors. Do not get letters from any other field. MHC is largely based on Development psychology and abnormal psychology. If you can get a letter from those 2 classes you are golden. If you use other letters, you will give off the perception that you are trying to make a thin file, look fat.\n\n4. If you have work experience related to psychology and MHC, you can get a letter from your work place. Otherwise, do not include a letter, just stick to #3.\n\n5. Google yourself. Have you ever submitted any papers on coursehero, chegg, or is your name attached to anything unethical, pics of you smoking/partying, etc. If you have such Google results, you must get that cleaned up before you apply. They do an extensive background search on you before offering admission.\n\n6. If you do get accepted, they will interview you. Sometimes they will interview you 1 on 1, or in a group setting with questions for the whole group. Sometimes there's an in-person interview, sometimes it's over zoom.\n\n7. Practice writing an essay in under 20 mins or less. In these interviews they want to see how well you answer questions on the spot, do you interact with other team members good, and how well can you write a paper under pressure. They usually give you a topic and then give you 20 mins to write about it.\n\n8. Brush up on your theories, and the authors that created these said theories. These come up frequently in the interview. \n\nEdit: CUNY grad programs are all state certified licensure courses and are priced flat at 5800$ per semester, this price point makes it attractive and they become highly competitive as the quality of the education is the same. Don't be let down if CUNY universities don't accept you. Private unis you may have better luck due to reduced competiton. I applied to Hunter, Baruch, CCNY, CSI. I didn't complete john jay and Lemans, I got rejected to it all except CSI. \n\n\nGood luck! You got this",

            "comment": "Since your gpa is below a \u201cstandard\u201d 3.0 for grad school. You might have to stand out in other requirements such as having a good lists of recommendations, and probably experience (such as internship and stuff in the field you are concentrating on). I think the best is for you to consult an advisor, not sure if that is still applicable to you since you are graduated. They should help you. I\u2019m sure you might still be accepted if you have a statement of purpose and are ready to explain in full detail regarding your academic performance in undergrad because they might ask for that if they want to interview you. I\u2019m not an expert on this subject but I strongly advised you seek help of a professional before applying with what you just have.",

    "postText": "I was thinking about taking BIO 170 at CSI over the summer and wanted to know how the difficulty of the class is. How are the exams? The class is offered in person over the summer so are the exams on paper? I go to a SUNY so this is my first time taking a class here. If you know any other community colleges that offer it online, please let me know!",

Its hard to know what you define as difficult, but for me, it wasn\u2019t too difficult. Just a lot of material to learn for exam time. If the class is in person than yes, exams are on paper.",

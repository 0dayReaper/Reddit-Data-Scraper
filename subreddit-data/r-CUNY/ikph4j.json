    "postText": "Most/nearly all of the answers to your simple questions can be found in syllabi for courses. \n\nSimple questions include, \"When is the mid-term paper due?\" \"When will the discussion board questions be posted?\" \"What do we read on this day?\" \"Where do we upload our work?\" \"What does the project entail?\" And so forth. I can't believe how many times these unnecessary questions, and similar have been asked in all of my courses. \n\nInstead of asking redundant questions, the first step you take is reading through the syllabi and searching for the answer on your own :)",

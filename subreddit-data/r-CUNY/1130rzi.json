I moved weight and was quite successful. I was averaging an easy 15-20k$ profit per month. I moved out and was living life. I had all my angles covered and it became autonomous, a business that worked like clockwork.\n\nShortly after, I became addicted to cocaine. I got hooked *really* bad. I had about 120k in cash, I blew through that on Coke in less than 5 months, I started spending my plugs money, I started spending *alot* of money that wasn't mine. To keep a long and highly illegal story short, I got shot, stabbed, and left for dead several times but I didn't kick the bucket, I survived.\n\nThis addiction lasted about 3 years\\~, then I realized that I've lost all my credibility in the hustling world so its time to go legit. I became a package handler, then I became a package handler assistant, then I became a contractor cable tech, then I became a sales rep and then I became an assistant manager at a reputable company.\n\nEditing company names out, to remain anonymous.\n\nI am now in Baruch, studying Psychology, and aiming to become a licensed mental health counselor, to help those in need, like I once was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, take a break. But don't do what I did. haha",

In that time that I wasn't in college I worked and and grew as a person, and in 2020 I chose to go back to school, I got my associates degree and I'm a junior at Queens College now at 32.

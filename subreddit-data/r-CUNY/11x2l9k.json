    "postText": "I\u2019m planning to transfer to a 4 year after getting my associates, I\u2019m still stuck on whether to choose bmcc or kingsborough. Bmcc appeals to me more overall and I\u2019ve taken a class there before, but kingsborough is a lot shorter of a commute for me. Wondering what anyone in the engineering science major at either schools would recommend! Thanks :)",

It seems like their selection of electives is not quite as good (lacking Circuits 1 and 2, for example, and quite a few others).\n\nIf you're transferring to a 4 year college, though, it might not matter as much.  It really depends what major you're transferring into.  If KBCC doesn't include electives that cover certain 1st/2nd year classes at the school you want to transfer into, it could end up setting you back a year (happened to me) depending on when certain prereqs are offered at that school.",

The only professor which I found to be challenging to work with has been my differential equations professor. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about being a student there.",

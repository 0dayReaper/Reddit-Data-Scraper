I did not submit my SAT scores, and I\u2019ve only taken one AP class (which is currently calc in my senior year). My extracurriculars are pretty good, I\u2019ve volunteered, and joined clubs at my school. I\u2019m guessing since many students applied, that\u2019s a reason why I\u2019ve been waitlisted. My stats aren\u2019t as crazy as others, so I hope this makes you realize that anything is possible (even though I\u2019ve been waitlisted lol)",

I had decent extracurriculars: being part of a volunteer program where we would feed the hungry, shadowing a nephrologist, and a basic virtual job I had. I think I had really good essays and LORs.\n\nI got rejected but was really hoping I would at least get waitlisted but I think my SAT score may have screwed me up.",

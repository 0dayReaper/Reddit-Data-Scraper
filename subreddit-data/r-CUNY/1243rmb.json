I'm an international student and l've applied to these CUNY colleges for the fall 2023 semester. LaGuardia, Kingsborough community college, City Tech, Medgar Evers college, CCNY and Brooklyn college. My application is now completed and being reviewed I just wanna know my chances of getting in. My credentials were evaluated and my gpa is 2.68/4\nWhich college out of the above do y'all think would accept my application with 2.68 gpa. P.S I applied Mathematics BS for all colleges\u201d\n\n\n\nI got an admission offer from Medgar Evers College when I logged on to my CUNYFirst account which I have now accepted but I haven\u2019t gotten an admission letter from them although I\u2019ve not paid the commitment deposit yet. My question to everyone is, do I have to pay my commitment deposit before I get my admission letter?",

But on the application status page, it only says accept offer / cancel the offer. I assume they would send me an offer via email and tell me about the commitment deposit due date? Or should I pay first to get the admission offer? I'm a bit confused because I'm still waiting to hear from Hunter, not sure if I'd wait.",

It takes a long to get emails about such things and sometimes you never get emails about it. You just have to check cuny first about your status. The due date for a deposit is 2 weeks I think for Baruch. Sometimes you have to accept the offer and then you get emails from the school, I find that werid but it is what it is.",

    "postText": "Like, I hate to be that guy but CUNY is doing a terrible job with online classes. The professors are putting forth  almost no effort. Lehman, I don't even know where to start with that school. Communication is non-existent with both professors and administrative offices.\n\nProfessors are highly unprepared. I'm a CIS student in my 3rd year and the one class that has a Zoom meeting, the professor just sits there and rambles incoherently for two hours and randomly searches Bing for pictures to show what they're talking about. Are they even putting forth effort?\n\nProfessors wanting 5-6 chapters done a week as if we're all just sitting in the house. Yeah, it's quarantine but people still have jobs and other responsibilities. I'm not saying go easy, I'm saying don't take this class being online as excuse for piling on an unbearable amount of course work. Again, not everyone is in the house twiddling their thumbs.\n\nCUNY insists on using Blackboard which is not platform for online classes. It is a supplement for regular classes. It's garbage.\n\nEach professor I've had, and other students as well, have noticed that their Syllabi are incomplete, lacking due dates and assignments this means that we can't work ahead even if we had the time to.\n\nAll I get every week is an email from CUNY patting themselves on the back for how they're handling this situation. This institution is lacking cohesion and communication. This Fall semester should have been implemented a lot more strategically. This pandemic didn't happen in August, the shutdown happened in March. There's no reason for this institution to perform this poorly.\n\nYou what you pay for, therefore I should just shut up and be understanding, right?",

That\u2019s the consent the professors are supposed to read to the students in the beginning of the semester or on the syllabus to ask for permission. The original comment posted said that the professor is refusing to record because he don\u2019t want to get sued. If he just ask for permission and nobody objects, he won\u2019t get sued. The professor probably don\u2019t want to record for some petty reason and saying that he\u2019s afraid of getting sued as a lame excuse.\n\nEither way on blackboard ultra when the professors records only their face and their screen are showing.  And even if I do screen record I choose what part of my screen I want to record. And I\u2019m not sharing the recording to anyone else but me.",

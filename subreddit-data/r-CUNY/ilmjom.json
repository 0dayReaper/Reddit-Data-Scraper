Discussion board question responses, for each course, due every week at various times, sometimes even overlapping (which can be confusing) + additional writing assignments. Overwhelming amount of readings, anywhere between 30-90 pages every night + articles. I mean do they not realize that just because everyone is home doesn't mean give us unreasonable amount of work that further negatively affects us in many ways. We all have our mental health and other life things to manage and take care of. I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed and anxious, can anyone else relate?",

I have a 100 level class that has the workload of a masters level course (says my roommate who is working on his PhD). \n\nIt's absolutely ridiculous that they are piling this much work on us, knowing the stressors of what's happening in the world right now. It would be difficult to keep up with a typical workload right now, but it seems that they have doubled down and piled work onto us just to keep us busy. \n\nJust for some perspective, I've had a 4.0 every semester and I've taken multiple 300 &amp; 400 level courses, but nothing has compared to what is being thrown at us this semester and I am already having panic attacks about being able to keep up.\n\nIf enough of us are experiencing this issue, maybe it would be worth it to write an open letter to CUNY that we can all sign.\n\ntl;dr  I am experiencing the same thing. I feel like CUNY has told professors to double down on workload since we are working online. We should write an open letter to CUNY.",

So many professors are just reading off their pp slides or textbook, rushing through the contents then drop a huge workload on us while we're still confused about the subject or the class in general",

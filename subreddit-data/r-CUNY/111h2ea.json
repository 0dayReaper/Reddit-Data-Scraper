We have online \"Science With A Lab\" courses that are actually good. That is a great way to meet that lab science general graduation requirement too.**\n\nFor anyone looking for online courses, they are still available for there. The Kingsborough Spring 2023 semester starts classes March 7th, so you have plenty of time to go through the epermit process and find a class. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the cunyfirst login page to look for courses\n\n[https://home.cunyfirst.cuny.edu/](https://home.cunyfirst.cuny.edu/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is CUNY's page explaining epermit\n\n[https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/registrar/resources/epermit/](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/registrar/resources/epermit/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven for classes that are filled, the campus is very responsive to adding/overtallying students into online courses and it is very much worth your time contacting a department for permission to overtally into a \"closed/full' online course.",

    "postText": "This isn\u2019t a COVID thread, I\u2019m not advocating for the school to open up amidst a crisis, I ask that it not devolve into that. \n\nI feel very sad right now, because I need to be able to get a good education, and that includes real life interactions with students and faculty. After I read that the board of trustees opted for virtual learning in the spring I had a mental breakdown. \n\nNo, I\u2019m not suicidal or anything, I\u2019m going to be fine. \n\nThe online learning is very difficult for me. I\u2019m not doing as well as I know I could because I don\u2019t have access to all the system I need to succeed. \n\nI understand that world circumstances has put my needs on hold for the moment. That doesn\u2019t change that it still hurts. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do at this point. Drop out of spring and do what...? Sit in my apartment all day? That\u2019s equally arguably worse. \n\nThe option that\u2019s really dancing around in my head is just leaving NYC and moving somewhere cheaper, where i can buy a house for what I\u2019m paying in rent here. But that is going to complicate my education a lot, and quite frankly, I don\u2019t want to leave. But sitting in a box all day, everyday, until... April? May? \n\nAgain, this isn\u2019t some thinly veiled political message. My needs aren\u2019t being met, I understand world circumstances complicate matters, but I\u2019m at a loss and every day seems to be getting more difficult with school, and life in general. It is making me re-evaluate what I have to do to get my needs met, and putting my education on hold, and perhaps leaving NYC may unfortunately have to happen",

Some of my professors seem to think were in lockdown again and have all the time in the world with the amount of work they\u2019ve been assigning. I can relate in terms of putting education on hold if virtual learning is causing you to feel the way you do. It\u2019s only best however you wouldn\u2019t sit in your apartment all day. Find ways to improve!!! For example find an internship volunteer if you can. Use that time to work on yourself instead of being at home watching Netflix or whatever. Then re-enroll In the fall and hopefully some courses will be back in person by then. Best of luck",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t want to minimize your situation, but rather show how online learning is working for me. This mostly comes down to professors attitude towards online learning.\n\nI\u2019m a biochemistry major at Hunter and I\u2019ve noticed the learning/lecture process is roughly the same and honestly more comfortable. I\u2019m used to large, hot and stuffy lecture halls. Being able to watch my lecture at any place with Wi-Fi, and in some instances at my leisure is such a benefit that I hope online lecturing is kept in place going forward. My professors have essentially done the exact same thing they would if we were in person. Some lectures have moved away from exams and shifted to online quizzes. Some have moved to a take home, limited time exam. All of these have helped significantly because they are, for the most part, open book exams. It\u2019s less stressful all around.\n\nThe problem comes in with professors that were never that good in the first place, becoming even worse online. I can\u2019t necessarily fault them, bc chances are they are adjunct professors barley making minimum wage. It\u2019s also CUNYs fault for not making standards and expectations of professors. For example, requiring all professors to use blackboard or canvas. If this was the central hub for all of your classes, it makes things easier to organize. But professors are using zoom, bbcollobate, and other sites to manage work and making it difficult to keep track of things. Additionally, some classes are requiring you watch lectures before class to then come and dicuss during class. This creates a problem that students shouldn\u2019t be responsible for solving. \n\nSo I guess my point is that it\u2019s not the fact that classes are online, but rather that some professors do not know how to teach online",

I was considering taking this semester off actually, but my parents pretty much wouldn't let me. You're definitely not alone.\n\nAlso, it's definitely not cheaper, but I live on Long Island (with my parents) and it's pretty much the same here as in the city in terms of feeling trapped. There's a *bit* more space, sure, but it's still restricted enough that I hardly leave the house. (Doesn't help that I don't drive ofc but even if you can it's not much better.) So I don't know how different it would be if you did go somewhere cheaper\u2014especially since the pandemic is worse in many other parts of the country.",

I know you're trying to get outdoors and interact with people, but the landscape will be changed till the vaccine comes out. So if you feel you're not getting what you want out of school, then build up some experience in your field of study, then come back when in person starts up again.",

It\u2019s easily to get distracted at home and sometimes depending on your neighbors you can\u2019t control the noise level.  I am in the same boat as you about moving from NYC. I haven\u2019t taken a train and who knows in how long and clearly dont want to.  And paying a lot for rent in this city right now is not worth it. If i were you i try to get in contact with some of the counselors in your school.",

It's not good for me nor do I think it translates well to the field I'm studying. I got so frustrated that I sent an email to the president asking for lower tuition if this is going to be a thing. \n\nI totally think the quality of education took a much deeper dive when we went online. I was already not a fan of it when it was in person, but I could at least feel productive. It's hard to care about classes when you work 8 hours and then log on to class for another 3 hours. It's honestly draining mentally.",

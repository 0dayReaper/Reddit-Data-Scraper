    "postText": "I'm currently a comp sci major in QC and I'm considering transferring to John Jay to major in cybersecurity. The program at John Jay requires several of the same classes I'm supposed to take at QC for comp sci (C++, Javascript, discrete math, and a few others). If I complete those classes while I'm still in QC would they count toward my degree at John Jay or would I have to retake them at that school? Also is it possible to find out how many of my credits will be accepted before transferring?",

Beautiful campus, but they make you take such a massive number of classes to graduate, that a lot of people graduate late. Imo it\u2019s not worth it, especially if you aren\u2019t certain yet if you love coding. John Jay provides more flexibility imo because you can always focus more on cyber security over algorithms and such if you don\u2019t end up enjoying pure coding that much.",

While I do like coding, I don't plan on making a career out of it. I'd maybe consider it more of a side hustle.\n\nAlso I'm currently a senior (went to community college and FSC before QC), so I'm supposed to graduate soon, but with the all of the extra classes QC is making me take, I'm basically a lower sophomore again and it'll be at least another 2 years before I can graduate.",

It's also pretty fun. I also never ended up going into the coding field, went cloud support.\n\nMy friend is in the same boat. He should've graduated in 2021, after transferring to QC sophomore or junior year. Insane regret for him now, because of all the classes they require and the level of complexity for a lot of them. He's graduating end of this school year, 2 years late. Never failed a class or anything. This is why I can never recommend QC.",

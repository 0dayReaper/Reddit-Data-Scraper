So now I have to fill out the TAP form, but it says I need a STUDENT ID number, so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s the same EMPLID I\u2019ve been using since I\u2019ve been in lehman college? \n\nAlso I\u2019m wondering when I\u2019ll be getting my Hunter email address or will I continue using my lehman email address?",

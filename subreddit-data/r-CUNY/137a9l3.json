    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m an incoming freshman for Fall 2023 at BMCC.\n\nSo I need to take MAT 12 and was told to sign up for the Summer Immersion ll program. I signed up and was told I\u2019d get an email within a week telling me if I didn\u2019t get into the program. I didn\u2019t get anything so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I see something that says Math Placement on my Milestone list, and it says completed so I\u2019m really confused! Any help would be great! \n\nThanks! ;-;",

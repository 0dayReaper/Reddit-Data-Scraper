York is located in such a shitty neighborhood and most classes look pretty old. The whole college needs a makeover. And they got rid of the book store back in 2018.",

I have two more classes in the summer, then I\u2019m transferring to York to do my bachelors in education for the Fall. \n\nI live all the way in Ozone Park Queens, so York is my neighborhood school. I would travel all the way from Queens to midtown. That was like two busses and about two trains. \n\nBaruch, regardless of which classes you took \u2026. The professors insisted on making the workload as unrealistic and unmanageable as possible.  You could be taking a communications class and have five presentations due in a semester. It was just way too much and it made me fall out of love with it lol. Plus the campus life is pretty boring all together. I felt so out of place there \u2026..\n\nI can\u2019t wait to get out of there and finally study something I enjoy.",

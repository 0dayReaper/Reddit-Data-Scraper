I have a strong interest in all these areas and career paths I want to use them for so I can't imagine dropping any of them but I also plan to go to law school so don't want to be at undergraduate level for longer than 4 years.\nHow would/can this work?",

            "comment": "can i ask why you want a BA in philosophy if you want to go to law school? just curious. wouldn't you want criminal justice or something like that instead? what career path do you have in mind for it? no judgement, honestly just curious. \n\nanyway. to answer your question.. i'm not sure. i think it's possible but it'll be grueling. \n\ni'm majoring in FEFF and it's 60 credits. philosophy is 39. polisci minor would be 18. there's one required intro philosophy class that overlaps with the feff major, and 2 electives, but you're only able to overlap 2 courses. assuming you choose one of those philosophy courses, we're at 111. add the 42 gen ed credits for a grand total of 153, divided by 8 semesters is 19.125 credits per semester, which is 1.125 more than you can take. HOWEVER, once you become a junior, assuming you have a minimum 3.3 GPA, you can take 21 credits. if you decide to do that, you will in fact graduate in 4 years. the other alternative is to take advantage of the winter session and summer courses. you can take 4 credits in the winter, and a max of 14 in the summer. if you can afford it or are receiving aid that covers those sessions, i would highly suggest it. \n\nit's 2am and i haven't slept in a while so my math and theorizing might not be 100% accurate hahahah but i'm like 93.674% sure it is. good luck in whatever you decide to do and welcome to john jay :)",

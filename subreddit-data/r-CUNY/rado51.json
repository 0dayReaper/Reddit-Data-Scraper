Deblasio made a law today that every worker in nyc has to get vaccinated except MTA and CUNY professors, but we the students have to get mandatory vaccines and mandatory nose swabs. Over my dead body they will, ask yourself why the state is making exceptions for certain people and not others, are they more important than you ? Decide that for yourself because I have and I'm not starting for this f*cking clown state where unvaxxed students are forcibly thrown out of classes while professors getting fat of a salary meanwhile their entire lesson plan can found online are able to get past the mandate. I've had enough and I hope other people have had enough too. Either the vaccine is mandatory for everyone or not, don't play these weird games and semantics.",

CUNY, although funded by NYC &amp; NYS are considered state employees (4 year college paychecks come from state &amp; 2 year from NYC) &amp; the Profs union is strong enough to get away with it until the state mandates it. I'm CUNY staff &amp; I had to upload vax proof like students to CUNYfirst (or tested weekly) &amp; I have already been randomly tested. Not to mention the bulk of Profs (70% is what I was told) are required back on campus for spring semester. NYS has to mandate vax for any movement on this issue as i understand. Good Luck.",

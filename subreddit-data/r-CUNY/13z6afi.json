They wouldn't give you credit for that class and your GPA is reset at your new school. In the future before the end of every term you're given the opportunity to drop a class and take a W. You're still charged for the class but a W doesn't affect your GPA. People do this to protect their GPA. On your transcripts it shows the class and a W.",

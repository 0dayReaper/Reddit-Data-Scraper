    "postText": "CUNY is sending out the third wave of federal emergency relief funds to students (letter [here](https://www.cuny.edu/coronavirus/university-updates/you-are-receiving-a-financial-aid-grant/)).\n\nStudents will receive the funds automatically and **do not** need to take action in CUNYfirst in order to receive them. You will receive the funds through direct deposit (if you have set it up) or via a mailed check.\n\nIf you want the funds to apply directly to your tuition balance instead, please check CUNYfirst &gt; Student Center &gt; To Do List to complete the permission form labelled **Fed ARPA Student Grant Fall**.\n\n**Students who have signed the form by mistake** and want to receive the funds by direct deposit/check must fill out [this form](https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/media-assets/Student-Revocation-of-Consent-Letter-template-2.pdf) and send it to [their college's Bursar Office](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/budget-and-finance/services/treasury-services/student-financials/bursar-contacts/).\n\nIf you have not signed up for direct deposit, you can do so here: [cuny.edu/studentrefunds](https://www.cuny.edu/studentrefunds). If you are receiving a check, double-check your mailing address on CUNYfirst in the Student Center.",

It is too bad that CUNY does not care about professors who are afraid to go to class after being called into the public safety office because the student who was just throwing a temper tantrum in class has possibly made violent threats against such professors!

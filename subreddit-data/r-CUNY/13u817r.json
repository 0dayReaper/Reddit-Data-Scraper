            "comment": "I think it depends on what you want to go to graduate school for, though most programs require at least 3.0 for acceptance they also ah ask for a personal statement, you can explain why your GPA is low, if you have any F you could go to school and use the F policy to get some of them unweighted if you haven\u2019t done that already (only works if you retook the class and got a C minimum and limited to a certain number of credits) graduate schools also look at the the trend of your studies, if you had a rough start but had an overall positive trend later in your academic career that reflects positively on you",

            "comment": "Yes, there is. Research the masters program you are trying to get into.  Then start taking one or two of the programs classes as a non matriculated student.  \n\nEach program is different, but you can do a maximum of 9 credits on average for programs before you apply or ask them for permission to take more.  This is practically one-third of the program already.  They may let you take 12 credits as a non matriculated student.  \n\n\nAfter doing well, you'll have to apply for the program.  Until then you'll have to wait until the last couple of weeks before the semester begins before you can register for classes.    \n\n\nIf you don't do well in those classes, you're chances of getting in diminish not only with that program, but others as well.  Not to discount your options of which there are many outside CUNY.    \n\n\nGood luck, citizen.",

    "postText": "Hello! I recently got a grade of WU in a class that I was struggling with a few days ago. I just spoke to academic advisement and they told me that WU means that I was withdrawn because I wasn\u2019t attending classes. That doesn\u2019t make sense because I went to class almost ever week until the semester ended. Plus, I turned in every assignment except for the final. I was expecting at least a D. So, I don\u2019t know what to do. I needed the class to fulfill a college option requirement.",

Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to submit an official grad appeal with Academic Advisement (fyi.. this can be a lengthy process).",

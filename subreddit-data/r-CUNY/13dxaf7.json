            "comment": "The placement test is to determine what level of math you start. College Algebra is mandatory as part of the core requirements. If your major requires additional math like statistics, trigonometry etc you take those after. The test has many areas so the better you do the levels you skip. The worse you do determines if you get put in remedial classes which are non-credit. You take a remedial class and once you pass you can move ahead. After COVID a lot of people were failing the test so they did workshops at KCC over the summer. They were on-line. The instructors were Russian and made math so easy. I'm bad at math so this was a game changer. You take the test at the end of the workshop and get placed based on how you do. I went from being bad at math to taking an advanced statistics class at SPS.",

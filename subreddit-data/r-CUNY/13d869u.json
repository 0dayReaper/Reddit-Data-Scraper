Brooklyn College has a 56% graduation rate, which is good and some students have graduated with a degree in less than 4 years. Baruch college has the highest graduation rate at 70% and it's a top ranked college with  a lot of majors to choose from, one of which is English. It takes less than hour to travel to Baruch college by car or subway from where I live. As for Brooklyn, it's less than 30 minutes by either car or bus.",

However, remember that online classes will soon completely end, so make sure you are calculating distance and travel time between your home and the location of the two campuses. I am planning on transferring to Baruch after finishing with BMCC because I want the competitive name and also I honestly hang out around the area a lot lol. But honestly, just figure out if you wanna do a 2 year program or a 4 year program. For CIS, you will mostly be taking on IT, Networking or Telecomm jobs involving cabling and infrastructure. So the degree is not the most important thing. Your Comptia+ certs are the important ones. Skip A+ go for N+ S+ and find out what field you wanna do and then pick the certification that you will need. You will be able to land yourself a job faster like that. And just FYI, BMCC has a lot of damn resources to get you either an internship and sometimes a job...",

I will give you the good professors to take and if you do your work on time and practice online, you should never run into any issue in their class. So, I am not sure which classes you will need to take, but I will start from all the way in the beginning. For CSC 101, you have professor Rhea Jara, do the work on time, there are online assignments I believe that you can always get help online with or find tutorial videos on. For CSC 110 you can take Lin Leung, very sweet lady and very caring, just do her work and submit it, she is not strict at all, but attendance is important for her and spend the class time to even get deeper into the rabbit hole with languages like python which are preffered in tech world. Then for CIS 345, you can try to take Farjana Ferdousy, she is new to the topic, she will mostly be reading off of slides, but you can always just have your laptop out and also practice some important tasks or get assignments done for another class. And for Unix 440, avoid George Nossa as he will test you as if you are a sys admin. Take Mathew Conroy instead, that is who I am taking class with this coming semester in the fall. 395 you can take Naranjo but be very careful with this guy as he is not good at explaining the tech side of database technology so youtube and google will be your friend and make sure to try to complete your work on time. For CIS 385 you definitely must take Professor Jose Vargas, nice gentleman, he can be a little too fast to keep up with but you can always just attempt to finish the whole assignment or project at home with the help of the reddit community or you can dm me for help with his assignments. Keep a screenshot of this comment and refer back to it later if you have your doubts, social life there is good only within the classroom if you do not plan on being involved in any club. Most of the time you will find yourself taking classes in the Fitterman Hall, so if you want any social interactions or club meetings then you will be heading to the Main campus building at 199 chambers street. You are also a 15 minute walk away from SOHO which I love due to being a fashion house of New York and its just a pleasant area to hang out in with fancy buildings and high art...",

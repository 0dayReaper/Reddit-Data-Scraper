She has a BA and a post-BA dentistry degree but is looking to leave. \n\nShe's looking at all the various application requirements and she was talking about her TOEFL test. I figured I'd try to learn something also just on my end and found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syria/comments/vtirdw/urgent_question/), where someone mentioned the IELTS test which is a similar test. Is there any preference given to one over the other?",

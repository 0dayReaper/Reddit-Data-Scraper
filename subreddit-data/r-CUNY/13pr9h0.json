    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI am from CUNY Hunter, I know it's late for summer class questions but I need to take 2 classes this summer-one via e-permit and one in my home college. I am a financial aid recipient and have heard that they offer finaid when it's up to 6 credits. So, I wanted to know the steps, do I apply for the FAFSA for the 2023-2024 first? Please let me know if you have any suggestions or advice. I am checking in to make sure I don't have to pay a lot extra at the end.\n\nThanks!",

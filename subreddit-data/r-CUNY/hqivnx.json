ANd CUNY isn't a smallish school district. If NYC region has less than 5% but Brooklyn has 10%, then the CUNY campuses in Brooklyn shouldn't be opening (incl ones not in Brooklyn with a lot of students who come in from Brooklyn). \n\nAnd CUNY likely won't accept having some campuses closed but others open.",

If everybody goes back to class in person, the numbers will shoot back up like before. Overcrowded trains and buses will help the spread even more. Open them again when a vaccine is prepared. If not, hybrid classes will do.",

These things are just made-on-the-run guidelines for planning purposes\"",

I have been unemployed for the past 2 years because the radiography program schedule simply makes it impossible to work and school. I have a whole family at home and separately supporting a parent while racking up my loans. My last semester was supposed to end in June and I could\u2019ve receive employment at that point, also could\u2019ve received my associates and sit in for board exam. I will be going onto 2,5 years now of being out of a job because I still have to return in the fall and complete for that June semester. I absolutely pray that schools open and in person goes back even if it\u2019s half, whether I have to be in the lab and complete my missing competency exams or go back to the hospital for the remainder of the internship. These competencies are something that cannot be completed through zoom. I can\u2019t just afford to throw away 2 years out of the window and seek another career after busting my ass for all that time. No one mentions these types of programs when they go on a rant about colleges being open to only conduct virtual learning. This is my whole entire future on the line here. $10k+ in loans and absolutely nothing to show for it - I don\u2019t think so. I hope they re-open and take whatever precautions necessary but for programs like these this is an absolute must.",

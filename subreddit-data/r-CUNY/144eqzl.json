The pay is higher than some other fast food places, and depending on what your manager is like ofc, it can be pretty flexible with schedules. My manager is very understanding of school responsibilities and works with people to give them whatever work schedule they need based on their class times. Because of my classes, I often work evenings, which does give me less time to study and do homework etc, and makes time management key. I use a planner to keep track of all my upcoming school assignments and plan when I can commit time to each one based on my schedule.",

Speaking from a cs major point of view, if I wasn't actively incorporating the skills I gained from class and personal practice into an actual working environment, I don't think I would be as successful as I am now in programming. I can compare this to various other fields, not just programming. Of course, not everybody has the privelage of sacrificing work to focus more on school, but I found internships with contracts in-between semesters to be the best for me, personally.\n\nOverall I find dipping your toes in to the field you're working towards being in will give you real life, applicable-knowledge, as well as a better understanding of what you're getting into. Good luck!",

My work schedule was always based around school schedule and giving myself one day a week I wouldn\u2019t work to use to study or do hw etc. I worked part time I was fortunate to be able to still live at home which helped. I know some students work full time so not sure how they do it but I would imagine still basing their work schedule around school. I think also depending on your major it\u2019s more doable. My sister was a bio major when she was at cuny so she worked less hours than me when she was in school.",

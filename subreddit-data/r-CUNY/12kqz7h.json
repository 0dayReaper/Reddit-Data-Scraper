Having or knowing someone who attended is not the same as experiencing it yourself. If you want to live on campus go to Brooklyn College. Mec will only find you metrocard to go around or food no housing. Different people attended for different reasons and chose to stay or leave. I attended both Mec and Hunter College and chose Mec for my duration",

    "postText": "I got accepted into John Jay about a month ago. I\u2019m planning on attending this fall. I accepted my offer of admission already and CUNYFirst says my $100 deposit fee is waived. I haven\u2019t gotten any emails or notifications about what to do now. In my acceptance confirmation email it said they would send other communications about the enrollment process shortly, but that was almost a month ago. Is there anything I have to do? I can\u2019t find anything online about what I need to do and I don\u2019t want to lose my spot.",

That\u2019ll be your first indication that everything is how it should be. Accepted students day is also soon, which you should\u2019ve gotten an email about at well. If you are able to go to that, you\u2019ll be able to fill out another form to accept your spot, but that\u2019s not necessary. But as mentioned, you just have to wait. CUNY takes FOREVER to do anything and everything.",

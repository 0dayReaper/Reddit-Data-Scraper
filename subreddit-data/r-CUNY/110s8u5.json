            "comment": "Yes, you can get TAP but it depends on how many credits you have earned and your cumulative GPA. If the Fall semester was suppose to be your first payment, the spring can become it. You will need at least 6 earned and a GPA of 1.3. Contact your college's FA office and speak with a TAP counselor. If you reach out to HESC they will tell you to speak with the college since they are the ones that certify your award. You can also ask about PTAP for the Fall.

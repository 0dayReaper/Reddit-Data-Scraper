I haven\u2019t dabbled in algebra for about a decade now, and I don\u2019t recall anything at all, it\u2019s sad. \n\nDo you recommend I keep studying algebra on the side and hope for the best/risk an F, or just withdraw?",

I got through it with an A the second time, and things just clicked in Calc 1, 2, vector calc and on. I actually had fun learning in my later calc classes.\n\nSometimes you just gotta take a class more than once, or with a different professor for it to sink in.",

Take the time to absolutely nail the algebra/pre-Calc basic math. \n\nIt isn't worth it to stay in Pre-Calc, struggle, barely pass, and then have a weak foundation like that to move onto. Or much worse to stay, struggle, fail, repeat, barely pass, and have a weak foundation. W is a great option, absolutely no one will look at a transcript that shows W followed by two good grades as a bad thing. Plus for this semester you can focus on your other classes more once you withdraw.\n\nAnd don't rely on skipping College Algebra or General Algebra and instead taking a tutorial class like Khan's. Take the actual college course. Use stuff like that as a supplement.",

    "postText": "Hi guys, so there's a conflict in my schedule and I think I have to drop my course. But as the time being. I don't think I can enroll in any other classes. Therefore, I want to know if I will have to return the any aid if I drop the course now. I guess I can wait for the 60 percent date but I think the professor will kick me out the course if I'm going to be absent more than three times before that.",

Unless you really cannot stand your family, you can finish up in two years and get priority to a UC with in state tuition. I know for me I did the exact opposite and went to CUNY CSI for two years, and I've just accepted a UCSD CS offer but I have to pay 2 years OOS tuition.",

If you're Pre-Med and a Biology major you're adding additional pressure by working. Not everyone gets accepted into Medical School and not every Medical Student gets matched. Your goal should be the path of the least resistance where you can excel. Have you thought about staying in state and going to Medical School out of state?",

I wanted you to have as much information to make an informed decision. In my opinion going out of State for school is a bad decision. I'm a non-traditional student and I try to share what I've learned to help others. I also worked in Healthcare. I know 1st hand what happens in this process. Have you looked at Suny at Stony Brook or the SUNY PRE-MED Opportunity Program? CCNY is a good school but you may want to look at all your options. CCNY housing has been an issue and it's not guaranteed. I can only speak of schools in NYS/NYC.",

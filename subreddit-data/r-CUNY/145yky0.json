    "postText": "Hey all. I'm a CCNY alum from back in 2020. Here's a short post of CUNY advice that I wish I freaking got in college, but I never did and learned this the hard way. \n\nI aspired to be in finance, hit that goal. It was NOT easy because CUNY schools are not target schools for bulge bracket banks (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc). The only \"target\" school is Baruch b/c of the many alum who work there, the clubs that connect you to the banks, etc. Baruch students can and will be overshadowed by someone from Harvard.\n\n\\#1 This is a commuter school. Make the most of your time there\n\nSounds contradictory, I know lmao.\n\nLots of CUNY students do schedules where they take all their classes in 5-6 hours w/o breaks. They go to school and go home. I didn't do that - I chose the classes with the \\*highest chances of meeting an epic adjunct/professor\\* and lived with the free time. My free time was spent roaming every-professor-I've-ever-spoken-to's office. I was extremely popular, but it was all earned. When I needed help for any reason, I had help. (mental health, recommendations, jobs, friends, everything)\n\n\\#2 Network, work Day 0\n\nThe moment you know you're going to college, it's time to get working and networking. I was on that game before I even graduated high school. \n\nThis is a crazy story, but it shows you the power of NYC and ANY job, even McDonald's. I was working a not-office job in Midtown Manhattan as a 17 year old, met someone who worked at Bank of America a few blocks away, and he invited me to his office. Found out he's a director in his specialty, and he said I could be his intern. \n\nDidn't take the offer. \n\nYoung me didn't know anything about Bank of America yet, but I did end up learning about it months later. You can imagine how frustrated I was for not taking the job AND staying in contact. That's NYC. You have everyone everywhere. They could be a CEO and you don't know. They could hire you, and you'd never know that's coming\n\n\\#3 Do your own research - don't trust every adult you meet\n\nNot everyone has the best intentions for you. Not your school's dean (even if you're friends). Not your school's advisors (no matter how close you guys are). No one. \n\nI was in a fellowship, and I was 1 of the outstanding fellows. I had the opportunity to really impress the Legal Counsel of a crazy hedgefund. We would have lunch for 3 hours together. That's rarely heard of because no one of that caliber would spend 30+ minutes with any student. Definitely not a freshman.\n\nMy fellowship knew of my success, and even bragged to people about how popular I was amongst companies. But not 1 person told me to take advantage of this opportunity. When you impress someone like that, you can always ask for the job or even just to \"shadow\" their work. I researched this exact scenario and found out I had the perfect opportunity, so I did it for myself.\n\nNot everyone will hold your hand, even if their job is to hold your hand. A fellowship is meant to help people - they did not help me in critical situations like this. (Even though their org's goal is to help CUNY students overcome obstacles to getting epic jobs.. like.......)\n\nThat's a bit for now. I could talk for weeks about what I learned at CCNY/CUNY. Can't say it all in 1 post. May everyone benefit from the things I wish I knew as a CUNY student.",

Just to be sure.\n\nHere's my take on this - you can approach this 3 ways.\n\nIf you go to my alma mater CCNY, you will have a great cybersecurity program but the alum network is small. You will be on your own hustling to get internships every year just so your resume looks good to get the full-time job out of college.\n\n(FYI-the engineering, CIS degrees are harsh at CCNY. The professors built the degree to be life-taking to find the best talent. It's demoralizing.) \n\nIf you go to Baruch, you'll def find alum for cybersecurity even though the school is biz/accting, but you would have to add the extra work to pickup on the knowledge. \n\nMy best advice is, both schools are great, but find yourself a professional network or fellowship outside of CUNY to help you with cybersecurity opportunities. I was in 3 fellowships, but none are cybersecurity-oriented. None of the alums came out in that too, so it'd be a worthless recommendation. \n\nOr as I did--go for any school and network your way across all the CUNYs. I did that. Any CUNY school is open to students from other CUNY schools. You can go to Baruch, and do research at CCNY.",

This is because it weeds out students who can continue on into their major or have to find something else. This does not mean it\u2019s impossible. Just make sure to spend the time studying, practicing problems and using resources like the student center and prof Leonard on YouTube. \n\nWhich school are you coming from?",

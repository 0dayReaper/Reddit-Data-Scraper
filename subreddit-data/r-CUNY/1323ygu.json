    "postText": "I recently took 2 CLEP exams and truly struggled to have the credits received and applied by Hunter\u2019s Admissions team, I googled a lot and couldn\u2019t find any resources so please let me be that for you! \n\n1. When you register for the CLEP exam, make sure to input the Hunter College code so that the they know were to send the score transcript. Unfortunately, more than likely they will not receive this document because it is sent to the central CUNY office :/ \n\n2. After taking the exam, check your CLEP (College Board) account the next day, and you\u2019ll see your official scores. Save a screenshot of this. \n\n3. Now, go to the Admissions Office in the North Building (room 100) and let them know you\u2019re wanting to admit your CLEP scores. Ask them if they have received the transcript. They will most likely say no. \n\n4. At this point, offer to send them your scores through email (you\u2019re better off not telling them it\u2019s a screenshot. Sounds less official.) I sent mine to: trceval@hunter.cuny.edu. The credits were applied the very same day, and reflected on my degree-works the next morning. \n\nGood luck!!!",

If the type of exam you've taken is not shown on T-Rex, you should still ask the college if they will give you credit for it, and if you think the answer you get is not right or  not fair, you have the [right to appeal](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/undergraduate-studies/pathways/rightsandresponsibilities/student-appeals-process/) that decision.",

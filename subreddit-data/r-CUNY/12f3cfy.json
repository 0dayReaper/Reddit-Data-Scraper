    "postText": "I currently go to city tech and am interested in the radiology program. My gpa is a 3.2 I have 77 credits I spoke to an advisor I didn\u2019t get in for this upcoming fall semester but she told me I\u2019d have a chance if I bring up my gpa to a 3.4/3.5 since I\u2019m right there. Would it be possible to bring my gpa up for 2024 spring to see if I get in for fall 2024 ? I\u2019m completely devastated and losing hope",

Remember the new grades are averaged with the prior grade if you have already passed the class. You can do it. \n\nI also attend City Tech and in a similar situation. I'll be finishing my first semester with a 3.2. Have already registered to raise both B's to an A.\n\nAlso, apply to other programs within CUNY that have a Rad Tech program. LaGuardia's Rad program isn't accredited so I'd take that into consideration when applying. Best of luck to you. \n\nLet's gooooooo!!!",

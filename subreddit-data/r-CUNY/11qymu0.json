As far as I know in general from being a ccny student it depends on your registration enrollment appointment every student gets in cuny first . Obviously seniors get priority then juniors , sophomores, freshmen etc.  what I will say is if there are classes that any level can take it can get quickly filled up by the time your enrollment appointment comes around if you\u2019re a lower level student. I would always recommend enrolling the first day that your appointment allows you to and if the class is already waitlisted , full etc email professors for an overtally, be prepared to enroll in a different class time or different class as backup plans. That\u2019s really all you can do.",

    "postText": "I'm a pre engineering student at Brooklyn College, and when classes went remote last summer, I took advantage of the opportunity to catch up on most of my pre-requisites and left myself with just two more semesters of pre engineering classes before I can transfer to another school outside of Cuny.\n\nBut with the next semester rapidly approaching, and all my physics and computer classes being in person, I'm just feeling not so motivated to return to in person instruction, due to anxiety over how it's not going to be the same as it was before the pandemic. Sure, I'll get vaccinated, and everyone else will be too, but I'm struggling to feel as motivated as I was last semester, when I had the freedom to take my laptop, fly to Arizona in the middle of a NYC blizzard, and do remote learning while also doing work out there and making money.\n\nWith classes returning in person, I can't do the work I was doing out of state, and now I'll have to look for another job to make things work.\n\nDoes anyone else feel similarly about a new in person semester? I feel like dropping out, but I realize that if I do, I'll slow down my progress by a year, since some of these classes are unfortunately offered only in the fall semester.",

It just made life easier. You could rewatch classes, no driving an hour to school, no waiting for class. It was nice. Now I'm literally signing up for harder classes because the others are in person. Even hybrid seems like it'll suck.",

Just not having the freedom I had the past semester it\u2019s honestly depressing to think about\n\nEdit: just to add on,,,, why isn\u2019t there more online classes?? Literally I thought after all this happened that our education system would change too. Like there should be classes to accommodate students that prefer online classes fully! I understand maybe you can\u2019t do online labs but damn for other classes? I would never go in person if online classes were an option.",

With online I didn't need to wakeup so early or be sitting in a library/cafeteria in between classes. I got alot more down being at home. Luckily for me I signed up for almost all online somehow for my classes this coming semester, but ik I'm gonna have to go back eventually :/",

I got denied because I was enrolled in the hunter class equivalent for the epermit at City College I wanted to attend. I had to resubmit the epermit and drop the hunter course in order to be approved for the equivalent City College course. Be aware that being approved for the course doesn't guarantee a spot, it just allows you to register for the course so make sure there are plenty of spots available before you apply. Oh and I think the last day to apply for epermits for the fall is the 15th/16th this month, not sure of the exact date.",

Some professors just read through slides anyway and there is not much discussion. CUNY is a commuter school and students travel very far to go to school. There is still so much uncertainty of COVID for the fall and winter and i think the school\u2019s decision to switch to in-person class is due pre-mature. If people catch COVID, that person and the close contact need to quarantine. How are they gonna catch up if the class is in-person? Online education offers student great flexibility and it\u2019s safer. But you know, it\u2019s CUNY, it\u2019s gonna take forever to make some real change. My suggestion is too put our feedback in the teachers evaluation so the school knows what we want.",

Idk about you but I think my department did a poor job at remote learning. Being a HNSC major I expected better. Don't drop out. I transferred to BK from a Suny but took time off in between. My biggest regret. Thinking about school is such a drag but knowing I am almost done is what keeps me going. You got this!",

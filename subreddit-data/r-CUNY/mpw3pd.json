Believe me you\u2019re not alone. \nI almost flunked out my very first semester (Freshman Year). \n\nWhat matters more than your education is your health. Email your professors. Be honest. \nYou\u2019ll learn how to prioritize based on how they respond. A lot of professors are kind, they will consider your situation. Those who aren\u2019t kind are the ones you\u2019ll learn to avoid. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s been over a year of lockdown. Things are weird and stupid tough for a lot of people. So don\u2019t be hard on yourself either. Try establishing one small routine, and make it a pattern. If it sticks and you get used to it, add more to your comfort. \n\nFrom one stranger to another \nYou\u2019re gonna get through this, one step at a time",

I don\u2019t get to interact with my classmates so I don\u2019t know if they are having a hard time or not. Yeah it\u2019s so sad that I\u2019ve built up a couple of good habits over the years that helped me to keep my mental health on check but I feel like I somewhat failed as I\u2019m not looking after myself anymore. It\u2019s sad but I really hope we can get through it. Again, thank you for your kind words.",

I have a couple of students who leave their cameras on sometimes, and it makes the lecture 10x more fun for me. Probably for everyone. So here's another idea: send an email to a professor every day. Ask about a problem, or a topic related to class, or a news item, or about their dog. If you can augment your professor-student relationship with something personal, however small, your brain will find it easier to pay attention and to make the subject more enjoyable.\n\nYour mileage may vary.",

Yeah, the tears and snot gets really annoying to wipe away but remember that crying in general is healthy. So don\u2019t be sorry or feel bad that you\u2019re struggling! From personal experience (old senior gal checking in\u270c\ufe0f), whenever dread gets to me, I take a mental health day. I just straight up drop the hw, the paper, everything. Do what you can to make yourself feel better! However, I would advise that you don\u2019t let yourself get too behind in your classes. Cuz y\u2019know, that\u2019s still pretty damn important lol. Depending on how chill your professors are, they\u2019ll likely understand if you just let them know. \n\nOh and just cuz I feel like it, here\u2019s a cheesy inspirational quote for ya: \u201cRemember how far you\u2019ve come, not just how far you have to go. You are not where you want to be, but neither are you where you used to be.\u201d \u2728\u2728\u2728\n\nWishing you the best!",

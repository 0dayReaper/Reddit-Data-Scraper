Even if they won't give any accomodations, like someone else said here you can choose to receive a pass/fail instead of a letter grade at the end of the semester. The pass/fail option won't even carry the usual stigma on your transcript bc of the circumstances. Some colleges are even forcing all grades to be pass/fail. So just do what you can, talk to your profs, and keep on keeping on.",

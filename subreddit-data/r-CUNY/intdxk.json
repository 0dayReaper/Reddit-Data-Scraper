Chem department at Hunter is exclusively online except for very few labs. I don\u2019t see any lectures in person next semester with maybe all the labs allowed back. \n\nCUNY simply doesn\u2019t have the ability or the resources to do strict testing measures on all of its students. Also, since most of us commute via transit it\u2019s just asking for it to spread like wildfire. \n\nUnless a 100%effective vaccine, that is taken by 100% of the tri state, I honestly don\u2019t see spring semester happening back to normal",

Current polls show an expected compliance rate of about 80% with more effective vaccines getting higher compliance which is actually the opposite of how we need a vaccine to work.\n\nWith the number of deaths expected to double in the next 4 months, if a vaccine isn't ready by the beginning of winter we may be looking at another lock down.\n\nAnd you are right about masks. mask compliance is better than a vaccine at stopping community transmission. The vaccine should help strongly mitigate  the home and social gathering transmission, then we can finally start to see the infection rate go negative.",

Time and time again I read stores of places opening up, and having to shut down two weeks later because of cases. If covid numbers decrease enough and stabilize nationwide then possibly we go back without a vaccine, but who knows if that will happen.",

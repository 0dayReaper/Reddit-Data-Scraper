    "postText": "Hey everybody!  I\u2019ve a really big and kinda tough question about the scholarship for undocumented students.  I\u2019ve been living in NYC for more than a year and recently got accepted to college. Currently I\u2019m in an unclear immigration status (pending asylum case), and probably for all colleges I\u2019m qualified as an undocumented student, but I do have a SSN, an EAD, and some papers from DHS.\n \n\nThe first scholarships that I picked was Dreamers.US but now it\u2019s closed for this year.\nThe second one is a TAP Dream Act but I\u2019m kinda confused of requirements that they have.\n\n1) Live in NYC - yes, I do.\n2) Without lawful immigration status - yes, because there\u2019s nothing else to choose\n3) You are or will be charged the NYS resident in-state tuition rate at a SUNY or CUNY college for a reason other than residency. - ??? Yeah, I probably will be charged as a resident but What are the reasons other than residency? I don\u2019t have other reasons :(((\n\n[Requirements Page](https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/apply-for-financial-aid/nys-tap.html#horizontalTab2)",

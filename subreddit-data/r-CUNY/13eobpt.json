    "postText": "Hi everyone, I am currently a Bachelor\u2019s student of CS in Tecnologico de Monterrey, located in Mexico, which is the #2 best Mexican university, top #170 globally and top #86 for cs globally. It recently came to mind transferring or just applying to certain CUNY colleges, more specifically City College of New York or Hunters College, since I have always wanted to live in New York and I think studying in the US is a major advantage for getting a job there. \n\nMy question is, which one do you think would be a better choice? I would really like a job at FAANG, and I know that many of the cs students at my current university have had internships at FAANG and also have jobs in this companies. But I also think that studying in the US is a major advantage for getting a job there (is it not?), since I think these companies would prefer people studying in the US at a not prestigious college rather than a somewhat prestigious college in another country, which is why I was thinking of applying and going study there.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best choice for me? \n\nI should mention that my gpa isn\u2019t that good, which is why I didn\u2019t think of applying to some university more prestigious than CUNY, and that I am about to finish my first semester here.",

I know ppl who graduated from nyu in cs with no jobs and those who graduated from west bumbafuck working in google. Generally degrees from the US are held in higher standards than most foreign universities. In reality, the college you go to has nothing to do with the technical tests in the interviews as it\u2019s all about grinding leetcode and algorithms.",

            "comment": "It all depends.\nI lived in Mexico and I know what is Tec de Monterrey. I also know it\u2019s a pretty expensive school, so either your wealthy enough to go to that school or you have a scholarship. Therefore please take the following in consideration.\n1. If you are not a US citizen, you can\u2019t access any type of financial aid, maybe a scholarship. \n2. If you transfer right away, you will be paying out of state tuition, which is way more money than being charged in state tuition. You have to be living in NY for a year to be considered for in state tuition.\n3. Rent is expensive in the city.\n4. education system here in the states is completely different than Mexico\u2019s education system. You would get used to it, but just a heads up. \n5. Tec de Monterrey is a great school. \n6. You have to see what credits will transfer. If you go to CCNY for example: if you don\u2019t have enough credits for engineering school, then you have to pick up classes that would get you those credits (happened to a friend).\n7. If you plan to work and live in The States it may be a good idea to study here. That way you don\u2019t need to revalidate your studies, which I heard is a big headache. \n8. I know some people who major out of the country and come to work to The States. I don\u2019t know how that works. \n\n\nHope this helps. I got accepted to BUAP, but ended up coming to The US. But since I was born here I get aid, which is a big help. I would\u2019ve loved to study at BUAP though. If none of the mentioned represents a problem for you then GO FOR IT, BEST OF LUCK TO YOU!",

            "comment": "A CS degree in general doesn't guarantee you a job. There have been massive layoffs at FAANG. Your skills and knowledge is what will get you a job. There are people with no degrees and non-c/s degrees working in tech. What you should be aware of are the costs of living and going to a school in NYC. If you're a international student you get no aid. You mentioned your GPA which could also hinder you. Follow you dreams and if going to school in NYC is what you want to do, go for it. Just make sure you do your due diligence about the cost of living.",

            "comment": "Your advisor will be in touch with information as soon as the commitment date passes. The advisor will get you all registered and ready for the fall (for first-semester students there are not many options). There will be plenty of information sessions and nice welcome events\u2014Macaulay takes good care of incoming students. And your advisor will be available to answer emails and questions all through the summer. \n\nBe aware that you will have orientation events for both Hunter and Macaulay (all the campuses together) and you do need to attend all of them. Don\u2019t try to push your summer vacation too late. Sometime around the middle of August you will need to be in town and available.",

                            "comment": "I like to stay somewhat anonymous on Reddit, but I can give you answers to any questions. \n\nI think Macaulay is a great program, but like anything else, it has to be the right fit for you, and you will get out of it what you put into it. \n\nPros:\n1. Close-knit community (if you take advantage of it) but with all the resources of a major urban university. \n2. Advisors. You get a professional advisor (not a professor who is doing advising because they have to) who sticks with you for the whole four years, and will always answer your questions and even steer opportunities to you. \n3. Prestige.  It\u2019s an honors college and known to be that (at least in the NYC area) so you get opportunities for internships and career placement that are not available to others. \n4. Early registration. Makes it a lot easier to get your requirements finished on time!\n5. The tuition scholarship and opportunities fund. No tuition and the chance to get a good chunk of money for study abroad or to pay you for what would otherwise be an unpaid internship. \n6. The seminars. I know many students would list this as a \u201ccon,\u201d but I think they are missing out and should be more open. If you are in college to learn, and not just to get out, these seminars give you a terrific chance to learn things about the city and yourself that will help you in all your classes and enrich your life more generally. The arts in NY, the people of NY, science forward, and planning the future of NY are unique\u2014nobody else gets them and they are classes to be enjoyed (although of course they require some work), not avoided. \n\nCons:\n1. Especially at the big campuses (especially Hunter and Baruch), there is a tendency to feel separate from CUNY and to feel contempt for the non-Macaulay students. And to feel like the college time is just to get out as fast as possible with as little real involvement as possible. That\u2019s a big waste. Don\u2019t have that attitude and don\u2019t hang out with people who do. \n2. It\u2019s not a \u201ctraditional\u201d college experience. Even at if you have a nice campus physical environment (like Brooklyn, for example. Definitely not Hunter), it\u2019s not the residential experience. It\u2019s not the secluded small college town. It\u2019s not a lot of frat party experiences. It\u2019s also big. You will have some huge lecture classes. You will have some classes taught by adjuncts (part timers or grad students). Your professors will not have beautiful offices with wood paneling where they serve you tea. \n3. CUNY as a whole, and every part of it, is constantly broke. Struggling for money. Macaulay protects you from some of this, but not all. You will know that you\u2019re not in a rich school. \n\nOverall I think Macaulay is a great choice for most students. But like I said above, you have to go in with the attitude that you are glad to be there and want to make the most of it. Don\u2019t be in a hurry to get done and get out, and don\u2019t be constantly wishing you were somewhere else. \n\nAlso\u2014definitely get involved with all the activities available (as long as you can keep up with your studies) at your home campus but ESPECIALLY the Macaulay Central activities. Take classes at the Macaulay building (they are unusual and really fun). Take part in the clubs and parties and events there. Hang out there to study or meet friends. The students who are most involved have the best experience. \n\nGood luck to you.",

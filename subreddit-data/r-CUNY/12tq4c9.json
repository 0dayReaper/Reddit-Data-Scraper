    "postText": "I'm set to graduate next May, 2024. I'll have all my major reqs and everything for my bachelor's degree done by then. But I'm still taking pre-req classes for grad school outside of the degree.\n\nI wanna graduate on time and wanted to know if it'd be possible to register for the summer classes during my last semester, graduate, then take 8 credits over the summer to get those last 2 pre-reqs without re-enrolling as a non-degree student.",

Someone the other day asked if they could do that, I wasn't sure but figured it wasn't possible. So the grad pre req classes aren't counted towards the 120 at all? Interesting. To answer your question though, i don't know.",

The thing that may make things difficult for you is you'll already have the 120 by graduation. Also, if you have financial aid, they probably won't pay for the summer courses since technically they don't count towards the degree. You didn't mention the school, but you should reach out to an advisor there to further help.",

Haha I was kind of avoiding talking to my advisor cuz he talks about me \"complicating things\", and I just know he's probably gonna say shit if I bring this up. But I'll do that, thank you for your help!! :))",

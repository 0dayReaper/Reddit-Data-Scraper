I have found a couple posts already on this sub, but any and all information would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "To anyone wondering, I had my interview today and this is how it went. \n\nThe first chunk of time introduces the program, and from there you go into breakout rooms and do some introductions and icebreakers. After that you and your group are assigned a borough and are given 25 minutes to design a presentation pitching a community based organization that is focused on a major problem in our borough (my group was given Manhattan, so our CBO focused on affordable housing). You are asked to specify the services you provide and the work roles/jobs that are available at your organization (i.e. program director, lawyer, etc.).\n\nIt was a really strange interview frankly. I think it is designed like this to assess how you work in a group, if you take leadership or if you let others do the work, if you have basic problem solving and critical thinking skills, if you have social skills, and how much you know about the type of work you'd be getting into. I think as long as you take the time to research how CBOs are operated you'll be good. And be sure to wear something nice and smile, interviewers always like that!",

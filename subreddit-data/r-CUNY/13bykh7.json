If you were accepted before and nothing major happened you probably will get accepted again but it's not guaranteed. Let's think this through. I would call admissions and tell them that you applied and was accepted last year. Life happened but now you're ready. Ask them what you should do? QC is the only school you want to go to. Get the name of the person you speak to and ask if you can call them if you have any further questions after they tell you what you need to do. Positive thoughts you're going to get in.",

The good thing is that you were self aware enough that you realized SB wasn't the school for you. Apply to QC. You're going to write a very strong essay. I don't know if QC requires one. Whether they do or not you're going to do the essay. Every school is different so I don't know the essay choices for QC. If it's one about yourself you should be vulnerable and write about what you just told me. If you want to message me so I can help you outline what to say I can help.",

GPA was too low, never took any other classes seriously other than my accounting ones; thought I could wing everything else. Went to a CUNY community college Covid yr, was able to transfer most of my credits which was beautiful didn\u2019t have to spend a long time there. Now I\u2019m in QC with like a yr left. \n\nSo long story short, you can always transfer to a CUNY but the main thing is you need to find out the minimum GPA for your majors department in QC",

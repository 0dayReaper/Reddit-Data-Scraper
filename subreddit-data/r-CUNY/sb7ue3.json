If there is an online e section and it is closed/full, REQUEST that you be added to it anyway as an \"overtally\".\n\nThe adminstration is  convinced that students want more in-person classes and don't want an online option.",

It\u2019s so frustrating, they had the lecture open for online but recitations were full. I can\u2019t believe they can\u2019t just add students \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd7a",

Definitely make it clear that you need the course now and can't wait. Be nice too, that goes a long way.\n\nIt also helps if you email the professor teaching the section and do the same, if they say it's fine with them if you're added, you can tell the department that you checked with the prof and they are ok.",

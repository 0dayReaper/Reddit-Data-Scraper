    "postText": "Hey everyone just wanted to share my experience with the interview process for career launch, it went really well I think it varies depending on the field but for the healthcare ones they asked a total of 5 question that were open minded not hard just stuff like tell us about yourself, future goals and some scenarios question that we\u2019re 2 they will put you in break out rooms with 4 other students and each one has a time to answer the question being asked I recommend dressing nicely and always having a positive energy and sounding sure about your answers they will like that! After this we just went back to say goodbyes and they wished everyone good luck since even tho you did the interview it doesn\u2019t mean you are in just yet I think they only have 400 something spots so best of luck to everyone, they also said that if you did get elegible you will receive an email by the end of this month so it was overall nice!",

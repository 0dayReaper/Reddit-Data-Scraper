Of course if you have a decent background for pre calc it can help set the story, you may need a decent amount of math depending on what school you\u2019re at. Some won\u2019t require you as much math, but what if do is start at the basics\u2014 start at your foundations and work from there. So in short, I\u2019ve had friends who were in CS who came in with a weak math background or just a solid foundation and it was a different feel for each one, but I noticed those who put in the work and extra effort surely made it in those math classes.",

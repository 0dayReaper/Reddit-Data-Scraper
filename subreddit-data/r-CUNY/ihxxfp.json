Other professors have said the same thing, although they said \"they would like to see faces,\" but many of us don't want to turn on our Webcams. It's honestly weird and uncomfortable for me. I'm in an environment/circumstances where it's difficult for me. Also, students can be mean, negatively weird and immature; take pictures, draw on them, share images or record other people, so honestly, I rather just not turn on my Webcam. For privacy concerns and personal reasons.",

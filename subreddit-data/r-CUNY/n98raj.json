I trust that my immune system has a better capability of combating and further preventing illness that the vaccine synthetically provides. My argument lies with being mandated to take a vaccine \\*that was made in such a short time frame with no long term effects allowed to be measured yet.\n\nthe vaccine does not protect you from becoming infected. the vaccine does not guarantee against not dying from covid. there are people who have been infected with covid after receiving both doses. there are people who have died after receiving both doses.\n\nhow insulated do you need to be from the potentialities of life?",

Pfizer even said \"nope\" to Trump funding, iirc, because they wanted nothing to do with that dumpster fire of \"Operation Light Speed\" or whatever the fuck it was.\n\nAnd we know quite a lot about the vaccine, and the virus. Viruses in the SARS family are very well-studied. There's more to learn, but there's plenty of knowledge, more than enough to make a robust vaccine that doesn't make people sick in the long term, except for maybe edge cases that are so diminishingly small, statistically, that it is difficult to separate them from chance. The jury is still out, but all evidence points to the fact that being vaccinated is far safer than not being vaccinated.\n\nThere is 100% enough evidence about the efficacy of the vaccine, and all emerging data suggests that the ones being administered here in the US are protective against many variants.\n\nI think there is just a huge disconnect between what people hear from their media of choice and, like, what is actually scientifically true about how this vaccine works, why it works, and its efficacy. By the evidence we've gathered so far -- and these amount to hundreds of thousands of data points -- nearly every talking point you've offered up is just, uh, wrong? \n\nI mean, you can start by explaining how introducing a bit of a viral envelope, which does not cause disease, into a body somehow causes disease, right?",

You need as many people as possible to take it to protect everyone: the ones that took the vaccine and the ones that didn't because...\n\n2) If herd immunity is not achieved a worse case scenario happens. Instead of a strand of the virus evolving around the expected time one year (give or take) instead the people who didn't take it give the virus a chance to evolve since their immune system doesn't have the exposure to fight it off effectively. Thus the vaccine becomes less effective because it was not made for the new virus strand and were back to square one... \n\nThis is a team effort or none at all. Everyone has a right to choose, but please inform yourself better before you decide.",

    "postText": "Firstly, I find it silly you can even be on academic probation for failing your one and only class in your first semester, but that\u2019s not the issue.\n\nI took 3 classes this semester. I already dropped one, I\u2019m getting an A for another, but I\u2019m struggling in French. Should I just withdraw or risk the F? \n\nAfter using the GPA calculator, it says if I get an A and an F, my GPA would be a 2.0 so I won\u2019t be dismissed from the college.",

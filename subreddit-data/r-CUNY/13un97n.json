    "postText": "Hi, just want to ask if anyone ever accepted into this program?  The content on the website is really vivid and I\u2019m so confused on the requirements. it only said that we need to have a BS or BA in science biological, chemical, physical with pre-requisite courses (including General Bio or Anatomy and Physiology, General and Organic Chemistry) and minimum gpa of 3.0/4.0.  However it doesn\u2019t mention how many credit should I take for each course. And I\u2019m also confused when they said that we need to achieve a minimum gpa of 3.0/4.0. It is means that all of our class should have a 3.0/4.0 or just the cumulative GPA? \n\nBTW, I want to ask if anyone have ever accept into this program. How was the teaching quality and how hard was it to get in?  I have a cGPA of 3.397 and my math and science cumulative GPA was about 3.2 or 3.3. I only have little experience (work as a front desk receptionist in medical clinic and research assistant in my professor\u2019s research team).  I been dying to find someone to write a recommendation letter for me.  TBH, I feel like my shot of getting in is so little\u2026.",

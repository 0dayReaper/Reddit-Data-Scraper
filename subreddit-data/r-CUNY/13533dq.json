    "postText": "Hi, this is my first time taking a summer class. I\u2019m a non CUNY student looking to knock linear algebra out over the summer (4 units). I\u2019m in the process of getting approval to take linear algebra over the summer but there are only 8 seats left and I\u2019m worried the class will fill up before I get approval. Should I enroll in advance? I tried to find the refund policy just in case, but I could only find it for fall/spring classes. Would this policy also apply to summer classes? Thanks!",

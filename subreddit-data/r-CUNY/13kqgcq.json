    "postText": "Hello, so i\u2019m transferring to another cuny next semester. \nI was checking transfer explorer to look at the course equivalencies of the courses i took. \n\nFor one of them it says: \n\n\u201cELECT 111NL: Elective Undergraduate: Non-Liberal Arts\u201d\n\nDoes that mean that the class won\u2019t transfer? It doesn\u2019t count as a credit? Or it counts as an elective that can be used towards my major? \n\nPlease let me know if any of you know. \nI tried speaking to an advisor but it wasn\u2019t very helpful. \n\nThanks!",

If so, no matter what your major is, you\u2019re allowed to take a certain amount of elective courses that count towards receiving your degree. So it may not count towards what you\u2019re specifically majoring in but it counts towards credits needed to graduate",

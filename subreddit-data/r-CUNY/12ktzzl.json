    "postText": "My son is planning on attending BMCC starting in the summer, attending there for a year or two and transferring. We live a 13 hour drive away so his options are EHS student housing (St George Towers) 15 minute commute; City College Towers - cheaper, more space, but a 40 minute commute; a shared apartment; and not sure if there are other options? \nHe prefers to do one of the dorm styles to start in hopes of meeting people. \nWe\u2019re also debating driving up with his stuff vs flying and shipping /buying supplies there. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice?",

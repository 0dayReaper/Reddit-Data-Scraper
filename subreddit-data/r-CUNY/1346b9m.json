    "postText": "Hi guys, need some quick advice here. So I applied for an e-permit at borough of Manhattan for a six week first math course, got accepted and signed up for the course when it was 23/25 seats available. When I casually checked my schedule right now it says I am 1/4 waitlisted. I emailed the professor offering the course if there is any chance for this class to accept one more student but I am under the assumption that I am not enrolled unless a student drops the class. I need this final class to graduate and see there is another class being offered in the second summer session but only has 4 seats left. In this case should I apply for a second summer session e-permit and try to get into the other class or wait this out and see if someone miraculously drops the class for the six week first session. Any advice helps I just am freaking out on what to do lol.",

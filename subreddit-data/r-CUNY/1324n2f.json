Pell on the other hand usually shows up on its own once you enroll for atleast 2 summer classes. \n\nThis is assuming you have a low EFC and are receiving aid for your regular semesters.",

A full-time Pell grant is about 3200$, 4 summer classes is 3600-3900 I forgot  you will have to pay the remainder of the balance yourself, which means no refund.",

If you use a TAP reward for the summer, it will count as one of those semesters. Not much to worry about if you plan on graduating within a decent time frame.",

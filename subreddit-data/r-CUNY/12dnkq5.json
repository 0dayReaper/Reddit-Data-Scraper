    "postText": "I\u2019m going for an mechanical engineering degree for the fall semester but not sure where to go. At first I was looking at CSI, but they don\u2019t have a degree for mechanical engineering, rather a degree in engineering science. Engineering science seemed a little suspicious to me honestly so I was also looking at NJIT and CCNY for their programs. Thing is CSI is a 5 minute commute and it\u2019s cheap but I don\u2019t know where an engineering science degree would take me or what it even is? Is there a difference between engineering science and a straight up degree in mechanical engineering? What should I do?",

Was in the same dilemma as well but engineering technology but currently at CCNY.",

So far it\u2019s been a good experience tho but probably gets more tougher the following semesters\n\nTo get in the engineering school, they have the requirements on the website",

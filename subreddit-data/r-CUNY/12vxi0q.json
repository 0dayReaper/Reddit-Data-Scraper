    "postText": "I know it's major dependent. If you pick a harder major obviously it's harder to graduate from.\n\nBut in general, do you think Cuny schools are easy to graduate from?\n\nWas debating someone and I was arguing how easy cuny is. Most classes are easy to pass. Professor curves everything and most of the time they don't even care. If you pay attention, it's not hard to pass at all. All you have to do is show up and listen. (I graduated from Cuny myself)",

There is also the ignorance that comes from CUNY regarding some of their chaotic operations. Professors make mistakes and do not waive it for the students. It is actually very easy for some to graduate from CUNY but it is very hard for a big number of students considering the drama that comes along with \"Reputation\"",

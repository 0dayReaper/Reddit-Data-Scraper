The class is not necessary hard but it is a lot of work. For the winter you are basically learning 16 weeks of math In 3 weeks. When I took it the teacher assigned us 7 hw assignment on Pearson and the questions can range from 10-50. We also had 5 labs which we needed to complete on maple software. Hope this helps you got this.",

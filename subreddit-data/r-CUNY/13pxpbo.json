    "postText": "Hi, so a couple of days ago everything was fine. I received a summer pell grant for this summer, and fall 23/spring 24 pell grants. Everything was good but now my summer pell grant and spring 24 pell grant just completely disappeared when I received a \u201crevised financial aid package\u201d email from QC five mins ago. I did receive a WU this semester but it hasn\u2019t been put in yet so did this affect my eligiblity?",

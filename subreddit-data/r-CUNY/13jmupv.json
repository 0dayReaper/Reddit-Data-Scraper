    "postText": "I'm going to graduate this month and I have taken out a 5.5k subsidized loan for the last year of college. I was thinking of paying it back now, but I can't find where to repay the loan on the Cunyfirst student center website. When I'm on the student center and click on Financial Account --&gt; Account Balance, it says \"**You have no outstanding charges at this time.\"** So I clicked on Make a Payment --&gt; View &amp; Pay Accounts, and it says I have $0 due. Is this because the subsidized loan appears after I graduate or is my cuny account bugging?",

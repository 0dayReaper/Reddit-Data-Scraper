My professor, Nate Cooper, will literally hold your hand and slowly bring you into this field. The guy probably has like 20+ years under his belt, owns his own design firm, and for some reason wants to teach us about UX. So I would highly recommend this class. Feel free to shoot me a message and we\u2019ll discuss further \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

Call wellness center to speak to someone and see if they can put in word that you're interested in work-study. If still nothing, you might just have to go in person. Also check for college assistant positions, sometimes the pay is higher for the same/similar roles as a work-study and you don't have to worry about it being based on your income or aid package.",

Once you have been chosen, they generally send you and email or letter letting you know.  Not many people get this.  Its limited in the amount of time you can work.  You are better off also looking for \"college assistant\" positions.  \n\n[https://cuny.jobs/support-staff-jobs/new-jobs/](https://cuny.jobs/support-staff-jobs/new-jobs/)",

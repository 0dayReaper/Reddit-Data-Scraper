To see how much you will have to pay go to cuny first login go to student center and then click on the financial account tab it will show you how much the tuition cost is.",

If so you need to have a 85 percent gpa or better, 2 years of English and have done 4 years of  high school math including PRE-CALC with 80 percent or better average. 3 years of science including physics 80 percent or better , 1 year of chem 80 percent grade or better. ( The physics and chem requirements can each be substituted by a year-long college-level non-calculus-based course.) If you\u2019re a transfer student than that changes thing one of the requirements is to have completed 2 semesters of calc with a c or higher. Every applicant is different so your requirements won\u2019t be the same as another as you can see so I suggest getting complete accurate information specific to your individual  situation and not listening solely to what others say because yes there are requirements but not everyone has the same requirements and I\u2019m pretty sure if you weren\u2019t accepted as a cs major under intended plan/ major it would have changed.  If applicants don\u2019t get into the grove school they can still be admitted into ccny  but will be as  undeclared or even liberal arts major and given a chance to complete the grove school requirements while here at ccny and reapplying again to get into grove.",

I believe it\u2019s calc 1 and 2 but I do know you still have to take math classes even after your first year. You can go online and type in cs major ccny degree map you should be able to find some links on a sample  cs degree map but when you meet with an advisor to get advised on classes you\u2019ll find out then. But you won\u2019t be able to get advised until after you\u2019ve take the test and get your results. Every student is different one student could have took calc 1 in high school and coming in taking calc 2 as opposed to another freshmen taking calc 1 their first semester because they just did pre-calc in high school. Regardless of how much math years you did the test is still required. As far as the test it\u2019s good to do your best so you end up taking the math class that\u2019s needed for your major. There\u2019s no failing but your score determines what math level class you will be placed in. If you don\u2019t score the score needed for calc 1 you\u2019ll still be in a math class but obviously you\u2019ll be behind in terms of math. I\u2019m not sure how it works if you\u2019re not placed in the class that you need because of how your score like if you\u2019ll have to keep working your way up. You can email the testing department to ask them that : testing@ccny.cuny.edu\n\nhttps://www.ccny.cuny.edu/testing/math-placement-test - you can find sample math tests/problems at this link",

My old cuny school if you didn\u2019t score a high enough score to place into the math class you needed you did have to take a remedial class and at the end re-take the placement test in order to be put in the math class needed. If ccny follows the same format then I imagine it would be you enrolling in  a remedial class to prepare you to do better so you can place into calc 1 your second semester.I\u2019m not sure how it works at ccny for incoming freshmen hopefully someone who know also comments and maybe the testing office will have the answer and you can also try and email the grove school department maybe one of the advisors may be able to help you out. Also if you got admitted into the grove school as a cs major you still are  a cs major it will just be the math class you\u2019re behind on.",

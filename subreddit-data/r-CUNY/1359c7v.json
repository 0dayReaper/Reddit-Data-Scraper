I know the Nursing and HIM Programs are really good. The good thing about CC is that after your 2 years if you are an honors student you can get a free ride to any school of your choosing. Advice: Do your due diligence and advocate for yourself. Look up Professors before taking every class. See what students are saying. Don't let an advisor select your core classes. Be proactive in every decision. Lastly as an Immigrant you have to work twice as hard as everyone else. Do the work in these 2 years, graduate and transfer to your dream school. Look on-line for grants and scholarships that your status has no bearing. Good Luck",

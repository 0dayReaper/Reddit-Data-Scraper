    "postText": "Im thinking of applying to Macaulay Honors next year. However, the application process isn\u2019t tied with Naviance. Has anyone ever just asked a teacher for a letter of recommendation and just applied the same one to both naviance and Macaulay. I was thinking of asking 4 different teachers for 4 long recs, but the process seems tedious. In addition, I\u2019m thinking of majoring in pre dental. I was thinking of Hunter because it\u2019s known for its med program, but after reading some posts, I think Baruch might be a better fit. Any advice?",

Either would be a better choice than Hunter for that major, and definitely better than Baruch (which I would not recommend for anything non-business).",

I agree that I would not go to Baruch for anything not realized to Business. I'm not sure about Dental but BC and CSI are the best schools for pre-health tracks. Hunter used to have a great program but something is going on at that school. People have to understand that there's a lot of politics that goes on at CUNY and students pay dearly for that. I think that's what's happening at Hunter. They say where there's smoke, there's fire.",

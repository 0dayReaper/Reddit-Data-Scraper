    "postText": "Basically, I am taking a 3-credit class this summer at CCNY. The payment for the class is $1,000, and according to CUNYfirst, it is due now. However, I am experiencing some financial difficulties, so I would like to wait until August to make the payment. My concern is whether I will be removed from the class if I pay it later in August.",

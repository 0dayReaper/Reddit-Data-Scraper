For example if I don\u2019t receive notification by 11pm I can expect the college to be open tomorrow.\n\nI was hoping we would get an announcement before nightfall so I could plan out my morning. Anyway this is my first snow day as a commuter, should I even attempt to attend class tomorrow? My commute is 45 minutes on a good day from bk to Hunter.",

If they close due to weather, there is a good chance that CUNY schools will also announce closures.",

            "comment": "The one time school closed/went remote for weather during my time at CUNY was during that bad rain storm in Fall 2021. And they didn\u2019t announce that until 8 AM which royally pissed off the people that showed up to find the basement waterfalls in attempts to get to class. I got kind of lucky because I was coming from Long Island and my railroad was totally shut down for the tracks to be cleared so I couldn\u2019t actually get there (and I really wanted to) - with hindsight seeing all those flooding stations I am so glad I didn\u2019t go, lol. \n\nBut to answer your question, they will send out emails and contact you via voice call and/or text message if there are any college alerts - weather closings included. I am hoping that they close campuses, but right now I see it as an unfortunate slim chance. The weather isn\u2019t really that bad, it might be slick and wet, but not really storm calibre.",

Personally, if it\u2019s a class I don\u2019t have trouble with, no upcoming quiz or exam, I\u2019d take the snow day. \n\nIf it\u2019s something I have trouble with, like math - probability and stats, I would probably attend. Actually, I hate math so I actually would take the excuse to not attend but you get what I\u2019m saying. \n\nHopefully your college/professors cancel class today though.",

When you subbmited the form they sent you a notificacion confirming you succesfully subbmited it and there you can find 2 emails where you can ask for help on missing documents, one of them is like the main email and the other one is for someone assigned to help you in the process, you just have to send them the document you missed and they will add it. Btw they are very quick answering emails so I recommend you to use it for every questiong regarding the admission process.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently signed up for two summer classes, but intend to do one. Unfortunately, the one I\u2019ve chosen as my backup (as it\u2019s a pre-req to a class I\u2019ve not yet decided I want to take vs. a class that falls within my major) is the first summer session while the class that does fall into my major is a second summer session class. Seeing as though registration has been open a while I\u2019m not sure how realistic it is that the class enrolment changes dramatically.\n\nCurrently, the backup class is full, so I\u2019m wary of dropping it as the waitlist already has 2 people on it. And the preferred intended class has 5/15 (me included) registered. But, due to the situation, I\u2019m going to have to make a decision sooner rather than later as I don\u2019t want to be responsible for that backup class if I end up not taking it. I\u2019ll be a bit behind on my degree progress (not in terms of credits but in terms of requirements) if I can\u2019t take a summer class at all so if by the beginning of Summer One my preferred class is still in danger of being cancelled, I may just have to scrap that one. So, it would help a lot to know how full a class generally needs to be for it to go ahead and run.\n\nThanks!",

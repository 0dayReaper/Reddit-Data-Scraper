    "postText": "Greetings, I applied for Fall 2023 as an international transfer student. I've submitted all of my required documents, but my documents are stuck in the evaluation process (Received/Not Evaluated). It's been more than 2 weeks, and I'm worried how much time would it take since I applied very late.\n\nMy main focus is BMCC, and I tried reaching out to them and spoke with several officials; even I went to Panther Station. BMCC said it will take around 2-3 weeks for the evaluation to be completed. However, CUNY Welcome Center officials say it might take 10-14 weeks. I'm really confused here, and I'm worried if I'll make it in time to get accepted. I don't want to lose a semester here just cause of the evaluation thingy.\n\nIs there anyone here who's going through the same trouble? I'm looking for some answers here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bb78ur6j7o3b1.png?width=1258&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1eb1bbc2afc4d674618c612c5984fea0c36ec23a",

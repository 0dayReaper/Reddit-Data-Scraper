    "postText": "Because of the pandemic we all had to learn to distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous online courses, now there's a new terminology/modality being used: \"HyFlex\". \n\nIn the Hyflex modality/method a course section has a classroom and time during which it meets and a student can show up every day to class and not miss anything. At the same time there is a completely online version of the course and a student can never show up to a single class and still not miss anything in the course. Students then pick and choose when they want to come in if ever.\n\nThis type of course has been around since the early 2000s but obviously hadn't been widely adopted because it creates a lot of extra work for instructors and because there aren't \\*that\\* many students looking for online course (alternatively,  fully online programs and schools had surged in popularity during that time too). Because of the pandemic however, nearly every CUNY instructor has a fully online version of their course and they can very easily port that online course into future sections. \n\nI suspect that all instructors who are doing in person and/or hybrid classes in Fall 2021 will also be teaching some sections that are fully online only. For those instructors, it's going to basically feel like they are doing this HyFlex modality. People are already talking about implementing HyFlex courses going forward even outside the context of the pandemic and this academic year might be the time we start seeing that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that most students want this type of teaching; it's something for everyone and seems the most fair. And beyond the issue of the pandemic, it'd be great during a normal year to not have to worry about missing some in person lectures, or even better, to have used the online component to really be prepared for an in class meeting and making it more useful. \n\nFor students who work and have jobs or family that they take care of, this model is great too, you can jump out of the classroom when you need to and not be penalized or fall behind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's an article about this teaching modality, ignore the (utter and hysterical) nonsense about college across the country closing because of the pandemic over the next year:\n\n[https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2020/05/13/one-option-delivering-instruction-if-campuses-open-fall-hyflex](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2020/05/13/one-option-delivering-instruction-if-campuses-open-fall-hyflex)",

Courses with modes listed as 'hybrid' or 'in person' could do this. Only 'online' mode courses can't go this.\n\nI have no idea how widly this will be implemented but it is notable that every instructor  basically has an online version of their course right now. It would be very easy to just at least carry over the blackboard section going forward.",

There\u2019s a reason it never caught on. It\u2019s the worst of both worlds and means that every student (in the classroom and online) has a bad experience and learns less. \n\nThere are high schools (some in NYC) that have been using this model for months now. Students hate it. Teachers hate it. Parents hate it. It leads to a wasted semester. \n\nIt\u2019s a model for people whose idea of teaching is reading from a PowerPoint or lecture notes. If that\u2019s been your experience of college classes, I\u2019m sorry for you. You\u2019re getting a bad educational experience. If it moves to hy-flex, it will get even worse. It may seem more convenient. But if you\u2019re in college for ease and convenience, you should try something else rather than college.",

I\u2019m a student at ccny not for cs but have alot of friends in the grove school of engineering at ccny it\u2019s a really good it\u2019s competitive and rigorous but worth it. I have friends who got their  associates at BMCC first and then transferred and some who got into ccny as a freshmen.  Apply as a freshmen I say but usually most students don\u2019t have the requirements needed and come in as undeclared or liberal arts major and earn the pre-requisites needed. If you go to google and type in grove school of engineering  city college requirements it will show you the requirements freshmen who want to come in as a student of the grove school need to have. I believe calculus 1 is one of them for example.",

The grove school is wonderful from what I hear, so if you really want to go to ccny I recommend applying for that. But hey, ultimately it\u2019s about how you feel and what you feel ready to do. Take a look at the CS course load at each school and look at the pre reqs. Many of my friends started off at CC for CS and then transferred with ease to the respective schools and they were fine. And some just went for the full four years and were okay. Look at your requirements and gauge what you can handle no shame in any school here at all, you\u2019ll do fine.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! This week I have to decide on a college and I\u2019m stuck between two choices a private school or a CUNY school. I have been going back and forth with deciding and now I\u2019m indecisive again. After talking with someone and letting me see their views on CUNY. They said that with CUNY schools it\u2019s harder to get a job if you go to CUNY and a person that has gone to a private school the person that was in a private school is more likely to get a job then someone from CUNY. I\u2019m planning to major in business management. So I guess anyone who is currently studying in a CUNY and with THIS MAJOR or even has graduated is it a guarantee you will get a good job despite having studied CUNY? To be clear I  want to go to CUNY cuz it\u2019s practically free but with this private school it\u2019s almost free but I have ti be stuck paying around the thousands each term for 4 years but I have connections there that can help me out but with CUNY I don\u2019t! So please anyone that can answer my questions dm or comment please and thank you. (I know this is all over the place but I can explain it more into depth if I chat with someone )",

            "comment": "I'm not here to boast about myself but I'm a CUNY graduate.\n\nI work for a top media company in NYC and I help to manage networks across multiple channels for this company.\n\nFor one, recruiters aren't looking at the colleges on your resume to make decisions. Most recruiters today aren't even from the state you live in, and a lot of them grew up in towns and communities outside of NYC. At the company I work at now, one recruiter had no clue what CUNY was... she grew up in Los Angeles and moved to New York City.\n\nWhile there are company bias, not all companies are the same. College is a business like anything else in life. And companies (like CUNY) want to give the best bank for the bucks. Private colleges, like NYU, partner with companies so their students can be recruited directly. Instead of these students experiencing rounds of interviews, they have a direct access to a internship after one or two interviews. Meanwhile, students from SUNY/CUNY and other colleges (who don't have that direct connection) must sit through rounds of interviews.\n\nIf your brain is washed to think jobs hire you based off the name of your college, you're not ready for the real world. People get jobs because of networking and their skills. And that starts early by taking internships, jumping from job to job or departments to departments (grows experience), and not waiting until senior year or graduation day to find jobs in the real world.\n\nI hate to break it to you..... employees and recruiters don't care how many exams or projects you had to work on during your college years. We don't care. Why? Because we had do the same. Yet, we went out our way to obtain internships, build connections and apply to jobs like everyone else. If you didn't make time to intern or build connections with people in companies, that's not a recruiter or college problem. That's a YOU problem.\n\nThere are many students in the United States that attend to top colleges who cannot find jobs in their field. And trust me, it's not because of the college name. It's because they lack the skills needed to be hired or the field is so limited they have to wait until they have luck. And some students are so brainwashed to think a \"frat\" is going to get them into a job. Like, no. It happens for a few, not many.\n\n**Recruiters are looking at your skill development, portfolio, website and how professional you are**. What can you bring to the table? Which college activities have you done that's aligned with the job? Which companies have you interned for? What challenges have you experienced? What software or tools do you know how to use? What are your weaknesses? Which extra courses outside of your major have you taken? Which company employee do you know? Which events have you gone to?\n\nCUNY is a college system. And all these students compete with each other and the rest of the world.\n\nAnd as a product of CUNY working with one of the best broadcast media company with various levels of media landscape in their portfolio, and helping to manage multiple different networks while making sure the programs that go to air aren't messed up and our advertisers are getting their money's worth, I'm here to tell you... I work along with graduates of Howard, Yale, University of West Virginia and other top colleges like NYU and Hofstra.\n\nDo yourself a favor, quit listening to people and their opinions on schools. Go out there and research the college and do your own exploration. Speak to professors. Speak to employees in the field you wish to work in. And please, don't speak to employees just to get a job, speak to them to build a connection! It always leads to a job in the long run!\n\nBig market jobs could careless about the college on your resume. They're looking for people who can help them make money. And if you're going to be in the seat making money for yourself, you need to know how to network and be a go-getter and stop letting a college name on your resume do the work. Be a self-starter!\n\nApplying to jobs online doesn't work. You need to network. Stop letting people who go to top schools fool you. Once they graduate, they're mixed into the real world like everyone else. A lot of them are in debt just like the rest of us. Some were just lucky to be handed jobs they never worked hard for.\n\nMake your own decisions in the world. It's hard for all of us. But there are A LOT OF SUCCESSFUL CUNY graduates out there, and I can attest to that. \n\nGood luck!",

But I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m letting people influence my decision at the end of the day I know what\u2019s going to be the best for me for my situation. I ask point of views only so I can really have a clear vision of the pros and cons I\u2019m still in high school soon to graduate and I know absolutely nothing about all this stuff. I\u2019m in a situation where people are depending on me to do great that\u2019s why I\u2019m having such a hard time deciding. I know for sure that you can get any job even if ur CUNY or SUNY or Private but it was something that I heard and it got in my head and started wondering. I overthink a lot of what I\u2019m going to do I go so deep in thought because I\u2019m in a situation where I don\u2019t have time! That\u2019s why asked a question and the view of people have gone to CUNY and have landed a good job just by doing 4 years.",

Now I work as a senior accountant in a firm . I also chose CUNY to save money (I practically got paid  to go cause of fafsa) its all about if you want that fun college experience and good job prospects. \n\nP.S I know Baruch is is a business school and I should have went there for accounting but nah I didn\u2019t want to fight during career fairs. Baruch has one of the worst careers fairs imaginable",

            "comment": "I think Baruch is a very valid business school and many of my peers are incredibly successful. Graduating without debt is also a major relief and a burden I don\u2019t have to deal with. With that said, CUNY often felt like it was on hard mode. My courses were good and I feel like a lot of the course work for my degree prepared me for relevant topics in my field. However, CUNY is underfunded in many regards. There will be thousands of students to one admin or career center rep. A lot of programs will be unnecessarily stressful or competitive simply because there is just not enough resources to make it go around. The Baruch alumni network is getting more robust and I have gotten three internships through Baruch but compared to what my friends at NYU and Columbia were getting, it was comparing McDonald\u2019s to Nobu. It definitely forced me to be creative and move with intention. It was much harder to build a network or get internships/training but I made a point to build relationships with some of my  professors whose work interested me, take multiple classes with them and they became valuable mentors and connections. \nAlso, the social life at cuny is very dry and it\u2019s not easy to make friends as it\u2019s a commuter school. \n\nWith all that said, if it\u2019s the same cost for cuny or private school I would go private. As much as I\u2019m thankful for CUNY, if I had money or scholarships to bankroll a degree from NYU or New School I think the resources there would have saved me a lot of stress plus their parties were always a lot of fun to go to. If you would assume student debt, I would go to a CUNY and just be very proactive and assertive when dealing with admins and what not.",

            "comment": "It completely depends on the college you go to. It\u2019s sort of like each cuny is built for one field. Considering what you said, if you go to Baruch, I think you\u2019ll be fine. I went to York College for CS, and graduated with a GPA OF 3.81 or higher. I could not for the life of me, get a foot hold for any job out of college. In comparison, many ppl I know that didn\u2019t go to a CUNY, were able to get a lot of assistance from their respective colleges, to at least get an interview. I wouldn\u2019t say that your college name influences anything, but the college connections/fairs that they have definitely can help, &amp; CUNY imo, simply doesn\u2019t have that pull, except for certain college with their \u201cknown for\u201d degree/field. I ended up getting a job for Amazon, but I got it on my own merit, taught myself things the CUNY never taught me, degree or job prep wise, and essentially all it did was give me the basic qualification of \u201cdegree holder\u201d to apply. But all my friends got their jobs thanks to their colleges recruiting/referring them to companies. So I\u2019d recommend Baruch but that\u2019s it. Take this as you will. Some people die on a hill supporting CUNY &amp; will disagree with me, but this is just my personal opinion. I think CUNY is a great value college education &amp; every state should have a sort of cuny, but I do recognize it has some major faults/flaws imo.",

            "comment": "CUNY verses Private Schools is a narrative that does more harm than good. It's not about the school. It's about the student. A school may open doors because of networking but that's not a guarantee for success. I'm a non-traditional student that went to several private schools and accumulated debt. I am finally graduating from KCC with a Business Management degree. The BM Professors were the best I ever had. I'm graduating with honors and a part of PTK. I have my choices of schools including NYU and Columbia. I'm sticking with CUNY. There's no longer this concept of accumulating debt for education. Most entrepreneurs are actually forgoing traditional education. I know this through networking in Real Estate, E-commerce, and Supply Chain. My path was experience than a degree. I was in HIM making 75K with only college credit.  With just an AAS my starting salary will be no less than 110K. I have options and those options are because I'm good at my job, not because of the school I went to. Technology has made it so that noone can no longer control the path you choose. Hope this helps.",

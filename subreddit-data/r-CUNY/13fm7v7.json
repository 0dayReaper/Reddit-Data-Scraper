I have been looking for housing in NYC, applied to GC Housing as well but they put me on waitlist and reading the threads it looks like I most likely wont' get in. If there is anyone looking for a roommate, please reach out and we could join forces and look for apartments, happy to share more about myself. Thanks!",

Some of my best teachers here at ccny has been PHD students at the grad center and it\u2019s a shame they are paid so little on top of having to teach and also do work I\u2019m sure for their PHD.",

I\u2019m shocked an Ivy League school like Columbia wouldn\u2019t pay more.  46 k definitely is not survivable in NYC.",

The GC doesn\u2019t have my field only poli-sci but there\u2019s a reason I choose international studies over poli-sci for undergrad  and I don\u2019t plan on changing it for grad school lol. The only cuny school I\u2019m looking at for graduate studies is John Jay and that\u2019s for their human rights MA program. Yeah that makes sense if they have to do all of that it doesn\u2019t seem possible to work.",

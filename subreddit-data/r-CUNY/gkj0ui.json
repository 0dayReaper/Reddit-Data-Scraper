Cheating isn\u2019t punished in the working world so I think all of this \u201ccracking the whip\u201d on cheaters is something that only works on undergrads. If anyone at all gets questioned, just deny it and say you worked it out on your own (for good measure make sure you understand the process though). \n\nI no longer give a shit about cheating since I just want a degree. I can learn more in depth whenever I want.",

Individual departments and colleges, and the university, make a show of cracking down on it so they'll look good to Middle States (the accrediting body). But they know that one of the metrics by which they're judged is graduation rates, which are abysmally low in the community colleges and lower-ranked four-year colleges. Expelling students who cheat, of course, will lower their graduation rates. So will giving them failing grades: Those students are as likely as not to fall by the wayside. Thus, CUNY schools, for the most part, aren't really serious about pursuing cheaters.",

    "postText": "I've been accepted to Class of 2024, on a full-ride scholarship for graduate school! \n\nI cannot believe it. This is still sinking in, but I wanted to just share. I graduated from City College of New York back in 2016. At the time, Michelle Obama was my guest-speaker. It was the opportunity of a lifetime to get her wisdom and guidance as my commencement speaker. \n\nToday, I just received notice that not only have I been enrolled back at City College, this time as a graduate student, but I'm going on a full-ride, tuition-free. \n\nThe years after graduating from 2016 - now are a bit depressing, but I am coming back and I can't wait to walk up fifteen flights of stairs, not be able to use the elevator, buy coffee from the NAC, and cry in the halls of Shephard. Visit the Marshak, and sit in lecture halls.\n\nAnd get halal food on the trucks. Hopefully the school hasn't changed much.",

There is funding for PhD's but that usually more often then not, requires the master's first, unless you can find a program letting you bypass it, but it's not that much.\n\nAs far as your question goes, it'll really depend on the industry, school, major, and other factors. Funding usually comes in industries or majors where their is a high-demand for that field or occupation, think teacher, or sports management. \n\nIf you're just looking for funding in any old major, like a MBA, that'll be harder to come by. Loans are usually your friend. Unless you're in a niche field or high-demand industry, chances are you will have to shovel out some money.",

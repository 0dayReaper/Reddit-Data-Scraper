    "postText": "I submitted my applications a couple of weeks ago for a bunch of CCs including BMCC and Queensborough. I just got an email saying I'm accepted to Queensborough but I can't find the decision anywhere on CUNY First? And I got a welcome letter to BMCC health services but no acceptance letter? I did apply for BMCC non-degree summer classes as well so maybe that's why? But why no acceptance email? And I can't find anything on my portal. Please help I'm so lost",

That was how mine came from SPS, you had to click the link inside that specific email it wasnt on CUNYFIRST. You can also check if they use the Navigate app, which is where I found my advisor info and to dos for my transfer school. If anything also just email admissions office for the school you are planning to go to and mention not seeing a link to accept the offer.",

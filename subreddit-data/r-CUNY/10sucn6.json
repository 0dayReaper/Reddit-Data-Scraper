Once your school has it you should see it on your student account. If not you should call them or jump on a zoom call to make sure they got your Fafsa information.",

They see what you're eligible for and if you're eligible for the max that's what they give you. I'm already a student so I only see the 22/23 aid. I usually see if before the semester starts. Every school is different so keep that in mind. Monitor your CunyFirst account",

Once they process it you will see a breakdown of Pell, Tap and options for loans. You will also see distribution dates for each semester. That hasn't happened yet so monitor your account. They are dealing with current students so give it sometime. Like I mentioned every school is different.",

It doesn't determine your efc because that's based on tuition and fees. Both Pell and Tap have a max that they cover. If you're eligible for the max your efc is based on the tuition and the number of credits you are taking. For example If you're eligible for Tap but don't take a minimum of 12 credits you won't get Tap. There is Tap for part time now but under certain requirements. What exactly is your concern? You start school in the Fall, correct?",

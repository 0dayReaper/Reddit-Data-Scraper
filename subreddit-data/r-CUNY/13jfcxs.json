Since I'm on my 6th payment I have to take 12 credits for TAP.  \n\n[https://www.hesc.ny.gov/partner-access/financial-aid-professionals/tap-and-scholarship-resources/tap-coach/69-make-deficiency.html](https://www.hesc.ny.gov/partner-access/financial-aid-professionals/tap-and-scholarship-resources/tap-coach/69-make-deficiency.html) Here it mentions I could take a three-credit course during a summer session to make up the deficiency, but I can't confirm with my financial aid office. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? Does anyone know if this also effects the Pell Grant. Thanks.",

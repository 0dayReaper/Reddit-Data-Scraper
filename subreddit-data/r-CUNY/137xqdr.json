    "postText": "Oddly enough I received a decision close to 10pm last night and I\u2019ve been put on a wait list. Reason being that there have been a lot of applicants with strong credentials that applied to the program. I was informed that an ultimate decision would be made in July. \n\nA little backstory: I achieved my undergrad at Baruch, with a pretty low GPA of 2.3. I understand that this hurt my chances. After Baruch, however, I went into military training in the army as a medic, and right after completing training I was on active duty in the city for COVID where I spent a year in testing sites, vaccine sites, hospitals and nursing homes. I also have one year of professional experience at a health care startup taking my COVID experience into the film and TV industry. My letters of rec came from a Baruch professor who I\u2019ve had for 4 different classes and the CEO and founder of the startup I worked for. \n\nI am still in the reserves and I plan on having the army pay for my degree, and what they would ask me in return is completely in line with my future career goals, so funding is fortunately not an obstacle for me this time. I realized I love public service and that an MPA would help me further this endeavor. What can I do to increase my chances of getting accepted?",

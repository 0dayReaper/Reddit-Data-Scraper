    "postText": "so i finished advisement recently and scheduled classes and completely forgot to ask my advisor so im hoping someone here has the answer lol. i am scheduled for 4 classes in the fall and 2 in winter for a total of 16 credits cuz one of the fall classes is a 1 credit course. does that mean i can take another class in fall? im not sure how many i can take each semester but currently that means my fall is only 10 credits. i was also wondering if i could just schedule another class myself or do i have to email my advisor requesting to add another class?",

More bang for your buck. You pay the same as taking 12 credits if you take 18 or 15. \n\nTo save money, i took 18 credits a semester and worked a full-time job. If you have a part-time or family support you, i would recommend taking 18. Otherwise, just stick to 15. It was taxing on me but doable. When i reached my last 2 semesters with only needing 12 credits per semester to graduate, i was just in cruise mode because after taking 6 classes a week, taking 4 was light work.",

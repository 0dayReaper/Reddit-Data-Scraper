    "postText": "Hello everyone! I hope you're all doing well. I have a big and tricky question regarding in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. So I've got to 4 out of 6 colleges and now I'm gonna go to Hunter College because of my penchant for natural sciences and medicine.  We arrived with my parents in NYC a year ago and filed an asylum application, now my asylum is pending (we're waiting for an interview) but I got all documents that I need to prove my residency (Driver's license, SSN and Employment Authorization, Lease and forms from Department of Homeland Security that we're on asylum).  Do you think that I qualified for in-state tuition or is there any way to solve this problem? \n\nThank you so much!",

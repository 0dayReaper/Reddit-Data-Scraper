    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019d like to do pre-med at CCNY, but I\u2019m worried that my regents grades are going to affect my chances. I\u2019m probably going to barely pass the Algebra 2 regents, I\u2019m not going for an advanced regents diploma (didn\u2019t take LOTE) and the lowest grade I have is a 68 on Geometry. My other regents are 85 or higher and my GPA is fine(my avg. is around a 93)\nMy SAT score is 1120 but I plan on retaking it.\n\nAlongside the rest of my grades plus extracurriculars,two AP classes, and two CollegeNow classes, how much would the regents affect my chances?",

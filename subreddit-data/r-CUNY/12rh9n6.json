    "postText": "I'll keep this post brief, because there isn't much to say. I am waitlisted for John Jay's M.A. in Forensic Psychology program, and I have no clue how likely I am to get in, or who I can ask for that information. I am currently looking at another school with a deadline of May 15th, and John Jay said I'd hear back latest June 4th. Clearly, there is a lot of overlap there, and it's very possible I won't know before May 15th. If anyone has any info on this, let me know!",

I don't plan on not going if JJ doesn't say anything by then, but is there any way to... expedite their decision due to the circumstances? I don't mean to come off as worth so much and a hot commodity, I'm just curious what control over this situation I have yknow?",

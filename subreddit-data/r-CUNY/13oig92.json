            "comment": "Why are you failing? Is it the material or the Professor? Did you look into tutoring or other forms of support? Did you reach out to your professor? I'm horrible at math. I couldn't complete my degree for 30 years because of Algebra. I never gave up and went back to school 2 years ago. I took a Math workshop at KCC the summer before I started. There was also tutoring offered. OMG If I tell you I passed the class. Passed the final with a score that put me in an advanced Statistics class. My Professor and Tutor was Russia and the way they presented the material was in a way I was never taught before. I'm graduating from KCC next month as an Honors Student, Dean's List and PTK with a 3.8 GPA. I say this so that before you think of changing your field look at the root cause of why you're experiencing difficulties. Maybe you need to take Physics by itself during the summer or winter. The CC or e-permit route like suggested above are also great ideas. CC have better support than the Senior Colleges. I'm changing my field to Construction Management and I have to take Physics and Calculus. I expect it will be difficult but I will find a way and so should you. BTW Felix Yusupov was my Math Coach at KCC and his Bio states he's taught Math and Physics. He was my tutor during the summer and during Statistics.",

All the lucrative jobs tend to be in the emails that are sent to the students. You will also be able to get Internships that pay well. I have seen international students participate in them as well.  There is usually a time limit for work when it comes to international students. On campus jobs are formed keeping that in consideration.",

The only way to find a job is to walk around to all offices and ask if they're looking for a PT college assistant. Focus on spaces that have a lot do traffic. Take your resume and leave it if they ask for it. Good luck!",

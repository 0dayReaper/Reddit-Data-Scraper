    "postText": "Hi guys, \n\nI recently got accepted to both colleges, and needing to make a decision and commit to one of them soon. Hunter's NFS program was my no.1 choice. I didn't get into the NFS program but instead they offered me admission to undecleared major. For Baruch I got accepted to Biological Sciences major. My intention is to study something that would eventually take me to the clinical dietitian/nutritionist industry. I'm also an International student. Not sure which college would offer me with better studying experience. I hope those who had experience with one of the schools/ or maybe both can share some insight. \n\nThanks!",

Any science that you\u2019re interested in at Hunter, you\u2019ll most likely want to e-permit. Baruch has its issues as far as financial aid but in regard to resources it\u2019s top tier. Hope this helps",

    "postText": "I'm a non-degree student taking a summer class at CCNY which will start tomorrow. I'm assuming I need an ID card to get into the buildings? How can I get that? I can't find anything about it on my CUNYfirst account.\n\nI know this is a bit of poor planning on my part. It totally slipped my mind and I didn't get any kind of email regarding ID cards. I'm guessing it might take some time to get an ID if they have to mail it to me. Is there some kind of visitor's ID I need to get in the meantime to attend class?",

Show your regular ID and sign in (print out a copy of your schedule just in case). Then you can go to the ID office and see if they're able to issue you an ID on the spot, otherwise you probably will have to email them and then they might send it to you in the mail. But when you try in-person, make sure to bring a copy of your tuition being fully paid (or anticipated financial aid would be covering it).",

            "comment": "Ok so first you need to figure out what school you are taking the epermit at. You need to find equivalent classes, which are classes that are the same course requirement as your degree requires. On CUNYFIRST you go to Course Planning, Course Catalog, search the class you need and then it will say fetch equivalent CUNY courses. Then go to Academic Records in the student center. There you will see e-permit. You choose to add epermit. You need not only the host school but the exact course class information you want to take. (Subject, section, number etc)\n\nEdit: Forgot to add that it takes at least 2 weeks for the process to happen. Both schools have to check that you are eligible to take the class, not just that it fits degree requirements but that you have good academic standing, no holds, stuff like that. Once it has been processed and approved you will get an email saying you can enroll on schedule builder. If you have financial aid that covers your tuition your school will forward that information along to the epermit school. If not and you pay out of pocket you might have to pay them directly but you will get an email from bursars office about that once its all said and done.",

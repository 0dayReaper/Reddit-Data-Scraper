I\u2019m personally leaning towards UB myself as it seems way higher ranking and I can actually seem to get an actual college experience plus it seems I get to have a higher chance of landing a job outside of NY with UB as opposed to CCNY. But I\u2019m still deciding and comparing to see which one",

Are you transferring or coming in as a freshman? If freshman why don\u2019t you go to a CC for the first two years and the transfer? To minimize the loans",

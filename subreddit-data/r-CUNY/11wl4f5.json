    "postText": "Basically I got into Baruch but couldn\u2019t go at the time so I applied again and got in but I also couldn\u2019t go (I wasn\u2019t able to defer of course otherwise I would have done that) .... so I applied a 3rd time and am now ready to go but on this application I got waitlisted. I believe my resume is more than capable to get into Baruch and that is why I got in the 1st 2 times. It\u2019s very frustrating to not get in this 3rd time now that I am ready to actually go. I am concerned I didn\u2019t get in because they think I am not serious about actually going to college here as I dropped my accepted application twice, but after asking them over email they claim that has no effect on this. I am trying to reach out to the staff to see if they can help me get priority on the waitlist as I believe I am deserving. If anyone knows anyone good to reach out to regarding this that can be helpful or has any other tips for me , please reach out / comment . Thank you so much I am very eager to come to Baruch .",

Also, the number of credits taken elsewhere could push you into sophomore or transfer student status.",

    "postText": "If I'm taking English Composition I in College Now (Freshman Composition) as a high school senior, what should I do about selecting my English class for the fall? It won't let me choose the next course after that. Should I just wait until the summer, or should I ask my advisor and/or the one who does the transfer credits to give me temporary enrollment given that I will pass (I have a 90/100 average in the class and how I keep up with it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm going to CCNY btw",

She told me that I might be able to put myself in the next level of English since Im in the process of getting credits for composition. But the system won\u2019t let me so I\u2019m asking what I should do rn as I want to complete my schedule ASAP before it all fills up",

    "postText": "hello!! im looking to transfer to BMCC for Nursing and was wondering if any nursing students from here could give insights on what the program is like\u2014 such as what the professors are like, how the quizzes/exams are, are the lectures/labs good and what not. Anything will help! i know nursing is difficult in any school but i\u2019d really love to know your experience here",

            "comment": "Hey there. I just finished with Fundamentals at BMCC. You get what you pay for and pretty much end up teaching yourself. The professor was nice but unorganized and just read off of a PowerPoint that did not match the textbook or Elsevier/Evolve. \n\nSimple Nursing and a few nursing study guides from Etsy came in clutch. Our Professor got most of her test questions from the textbook\u2019s test bank or the EAQ quizzes from Elsevier/Evolve.",

I had friends in the morning who complained about the same thing, the only difference was that their Professor was absent A LOT last semester. I believe the morning Professor is the head coordinator of the program. \n\nWe just had our lottery yesterday for the second semester and I\u2019ll be in the afternoon again. I hear that the Professors are tough, so once I\u2019m finished with my Summer courses, I am going to start studying. As mentioned above, I\u2019m going to use Simple Nursing and another I forgot to mention, Level Up RN (their videos and flash cards). I also want to start soft studying for the NCLEX with Mark Klimek\u2019s lectures and videos. A lot of nursing graduates mentioned how they regret not using his stuff while they were in the nursing program because his lessons are quite helpful.",

You will have to put in a lot of work on your own. If you vet your Professors you may get some that are supportive and available if you need additional assistance. I come from a family of Healthcare Professionals Doctors, Nurses, NP, PA, HIM and everyone had the same path which is collaboration. Working with others, ex. study groups. I\"ve met a lot of people who graduated from CC programs and BMCC is the one that has the best feedback. BMCC also has an agreement with SPS if you want to complete your Bachelors. You can work after you graduate and complete your degree on-line at SPS. The idea of a low cost education with little to no debt is the way to go.",

You're already showing that by asking for advice. The CC and CUNY programs have a lot of applications because of the low costs. I don't know if you looked but BMCC has a waiting list that maybe 2 or 3 years to start the actual program. You're correct. There's no guarantee of acceptance even after taking the pre-req. I don't know if you've considered this but another route people take is the accelerated degree programs. You can do a nursing program in 12 to 15 months of you have a Bachelors. A lot of people are doing this. Think about it. You have to wait on a waiting list to get into a program that's 3 years and you end up with an Associates. If you get a Bachelors that you can do in 3 years with careful planning, you can do a Baccalaureate Program in 12 to 15 months and you're have 2 degrees. I think a lot of people are missing an opportunity with this route. If you do decide to do the BMCC program after looking at all your options, trust me you will find other students that are in your position especially the non-traditional students.",

Just be prepared to self teach and figure everything out yourself because everyone will be contradicting that they don't even know what's right or wrong.\n\nSave up cause books , online assignments , uniform and more will add up\n\nEverything else will be by luck ..if the universe want you to have a good semster it will. If the universe have other plans...hang in there",

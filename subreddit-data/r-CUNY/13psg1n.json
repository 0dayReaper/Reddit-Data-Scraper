Was wondering, what school in your opinion had the best history/education programs? Trying to become a teacher in NYC and maybe eventually move back home, but trying to grind the degree first. Currently looking into CSI and Brooklyn, thanks!",

I know a lot of people want to go to school in NYC and get that experience. You should be aware that you will be paying out of state tuition since you're coming from FL.You mentioned moving back to FL As an Education major your curriculum will be based on NYS/NYC Board of Education requirements. Right now FL has and is continuing to make changes on what's allowed and not allowed to be taught. I have several friends that got their degree from NYC because they used to live here. One moved to ATL and the other to Palm Beach. Both faced challenges and push back because of their style of teaching and their training was from here. Look into this negate making any decisions",

Why go out of state for an education degree?  Doesn't make financial sense. If you want to teach in NYC, get your degree in Florida, move to NYC and supplement any NYS requirements once in NYC.",

Not taking anything away from Brooklyn College or Hunter, but you\u2019d be lucky to get the same attention or experience at Brooklyn or Hunter. You\u2019d almost as sure just become another number there. CSI actually has a community if you take a moment to get involved. CSI also has support programs that Brooklyn or Hunter do not have.. you should really look into your own college if you would recommend someone not to attend and wonder\u2026. Are you actually making the most of your college experience? Or you going through the motions and projecting your lack of engagement and ownership on others?",

It\u2019s a lot harder to get around without a car in SI and I had joined CSIs student government before for community and even planned things like spirit week and approved clubs or joined Hack A Project, so I do know what student life is like there \ud83d\ude10. But you are right when you say CSI is smaller so they give you more attention. I just don\u2019t really understand why you would come here if you\u2019re from Florida, when most people would probably prefer the Manhattan CUNYs",

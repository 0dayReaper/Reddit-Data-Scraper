WD is when a student drops a class, but WN is when a professor drops a student from their class. I feel like this could effect my chances at a transfer in the future. Has this happened to anyone? My advisor said I would need proof I dropped the class myself or pretty much beg the professor to remove the WN. Please help.",

            "comment": "First of all, it's too late to get a WD since financial aid has been finalized and you are no longer eligible for a refund. The grade you should get is a W. A WN means you never attended the class. You should contact the academic office along with proof that you did attend the class like a submission receipt of an assignment on BlackBoard to get the grade corrected to a W.",

I don\u2019t know about BMCC\u2019s schedule but at Lehman earlier this week profs had to \u201cverify enrollment\u201d and maybe yours marked you as not attending before the roster was updated to show you were no longer enrolled in the class. Should be an easy fix if you contact the prof or the registrar\u2019s office. Good luck!",

    "postText": "I accepted a transfer offer to Brooklyn College. The earliest new transfer fall 2023 advisement date I was able to get was for the first week of May. Is this like way too late? Do I need to email someone? Also, my transcript evaluation is technically incomplete because the current spring semester grades are in progress and they won't come in until after mid-May at the earliest. Should I be worried or something? Open to answers beyond Brooklyn College lol",

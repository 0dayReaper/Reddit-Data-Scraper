            "comment": "I graduated from John jay with my CS degree. It\u2019s an ok program. As the other poster said John Jay focuses more on criminal justice areas, so does the CS program so there is more emphasis on cybersecurity (networking, cryptography, etc). The program is what you make of it, this seems to be the general consensus amongst cunys. There\u2019s some good professors, some bad. From what I\u2019ve seen you\u2019ll get what you put in. Don\u2019t expect a traditional college experience, everyone mostly commutes, comes in to school and goes to work after or vice versa.\n\nI was only there for 1 semester(in person) but I liked it. It\u2019s located in a great area, 10 minute walk from Central Park, lots of food choices.",

Do you think the curcciulum is helpful towards software engineering or development or only cybersecurity related fields? Also, how difficult &amp; challenging was it? Do you know if they offer free tutoring?",

I don't remember taking any software engineering courses, but there are now free and programs that teach you some software engineering skills, get you an internship and even a decent stipend. \n\nI graduated last year around the end of covid times so things were very relaxed, I can't say how it would be under normal circumstance but I would expect it to be fair.",

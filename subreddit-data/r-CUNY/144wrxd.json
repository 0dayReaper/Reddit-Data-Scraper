If you're no longer eligible find another program. In preparation when you continue create a system to help you if you find yourself struggling. Study groups, flash cards, tutoring, taking a class alone, etc. Good Luck",

If you are rejected both times, you cannot reapply and would have to apply to a different school's program.   \n\n\nIf you have specific questions to ask, you should honestly be emailing or calling the program's coordinator/ director/ or department. They know best.",

If you withdrew twice already, taking it the 3rd time will not be considered eligible. However, you should be speaking with the department about your situation since they might take your B grade from your 3rd attempt. It's a case by case sometimes.",

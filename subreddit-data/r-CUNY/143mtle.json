    "postText": "Hi all, I recently applied as a transfer student to BMCC with grades being transferred from CSI. I also attended another institute that\u2019s not CUNY and used the National Student Clearinghouse Transcript Ordering service to transfer my grades to BMCC\u2019s admissions. Does anyone have a similar experience or if I transferred my grades properly, and how long does it normally take for them to receive it? For context: My grades were sent on June 5 but on CUNYfirst, it shows that they haven\u2019t received it yet.",

I sent my transcripts to them, and it's been 3+ weeks they been busy evaluating them. They said it might take 10-12 weeks.",

When I spoke to a rep from BMCC, they said to upload the transcript to CUNY\u2019s admissions email, but I went ahead and did it through the National student transcript service - within it, it told me where was I sending the transcript to, and to which department. I clicked on BMCC and it\u2019s admission\u2019s office.",

I used the National Student Clearinghouse to request my transcripts sent from my university via email and it took about a month for my school to email them. As soon as they did, CUNY, got it the next day.\n\nIt's best to send it via email if your school has it at all possible because it's faster. If you chose snail mail, then it will take whatever mailing time it takes to get from your college to CUNY and then however long that takes for CUNY to check their mail and add it to CUNYFirst which can take probably weeks",

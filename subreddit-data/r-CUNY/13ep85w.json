    "postText": "My professor came to me telling me I have to drop the class because of my attendance. She said I missed too many classes. I have so much going on I didn\u2019t notice it was that bad. My work however is C+/B work. I never got a grade below 80. 78 was my lowest grade on anything including exams. I have her for 2 classes and she\u2019s telling me to drop both. These classes are my major requirements and it\u2019s only 3 weeks left in the semester. Can I fight this?",

I'm assuming her syllabus does say something like this and that's why she's telling you to drop the classes (so you don't have 2 F's on your transcript). It the syllabus mentions nothing about attendance or doesn't say it affects your grade, then you can fight it (but it doesn't mean you'll win). Unless you have extenuating circumstances that you can prove (like if you had a medical emergency or something along those lines) you likely won't be able to do anything about it.\n\nProfessors will always tell you that it's your responsibility to read and understand the syllabus. Most of the time the syllabus will mention something about attendance and a certain number of allowable absences and the consequences of exceeding them. Some professors will just drop you down a letter grade, others will outright fail you. But if it says so in the syllabus, then there's nothing you can do about it. You can try to talk with them, but it seems like your professor is just going to fail you if you don't drop the classes.\n\nSometimes professors care far more about attendance than your grades. I know from personal experience. I was taking a course where I literally got an A on every single assignment, every test, every project, I even did extra credit assignments. But the professor's syllabus said if you miss more than 3 days, you fail. Now, the professor didn't fail me, she just gave me the minimum passing grade and told me she never does that but she only did it because I got an A on everything. But, that's what I mean by if it says something about attendance in the syllabus, you're kind of SOL. That's just how they do it, and it sucks, but that's just the way it is.",

But you have to keep in mind that a passing grade can be as low as a D (so 2 D\u2019s will have a very negative impact on your GPA). She\u2019s just telling you to drop them because getting 2 W\u2019s and being able to retake them is better than getting 2 D\u2019s and having your GPA destroyed.",

            "comment": "If you can prove your absences were due to matters which are considered an emergency, such as caring for a family member, hospital visits, therapy visits etc then you can fight it. But without that proof, you will lose the fight. I recommend reaching out to see if there are any extra credit opportunities.\n\nMoving forward, I would use this as a life lesson. Stay true to your commitments including your class. This is your future and you are paying for these classes, so in the end the only person that gets hurt is you. I would try to look within and see what I can fix to not repeat this mistake next semester. \n\nIt's not over yet and you can pull yourself out. I wish you the best of luck, you got this.",

    "postText": "I know this isn\u2019t related to academic questions but I have a friend who was a victim of the fraudulent check scam that targeted cuny students outside of banks, now she\u2019s down $1000. What should she do in this situation? Can the school do anything about this or is she just gonna have to take the hit and pay this off. Scammers suck.",

They went to their atm took out cash and handed it to someone.",

My friend felt bad after someone screamed at him to fuck off and helped him out, he was able to show his account and the everything so she went to the chase ATM and took out the money from the check, and gave him cash lol. The guy gave his number and was so grateful he gave her $40 for her troubles.",

She should also report it to her banking institution. An email was sent to students so CUNY is aware. Sadly there's no recourse if you're scammed. Even if the police are involved your friend won't get her money back.",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am looking for those who have or currently attend CUNY Graduate Center and are funding their own education, as the Masters program I am interviewing for does not have funding.\n\nBasically, my question is - how do you afford NY and tuition? I realize loans would be in my future, but I was hoping to gain some insight from those currently there.\n\nFeel free to DM me too!\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "I couldn't do it after one semester and I'm currently not enrolled in classes and considering transferring.\n\nPaid first semester out of pocket from savings and don't feel like I got my money's worth. I think CUNY schools are great for undergrads but not for grad school. The lack of funding and resources isn't cool. It's not worth it to take on student loans unless your grad degree offers you a bunch of opportunities and career support. Mine didn't sadly so I didn't re-enroll. But every program is different so maybe for you, depending on what you're doing, it would be worth it to take some loans out. For me personally, I worked the whole semester full time on top of full time classes so I could avoid loans. It definitely made me exhausted, but it's doable. Also, I don't know if you know this but you can pay for your semester in installments for a small fee if you plan on paying out of pocket. You can enroll in that on CUNYfirst.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say fill out FAFSA. See what you can get as far as loans but if you opt not to do it, maybe do the installments payment thing and pay for it in portions. There's also the Fulbright program, not for nothing. I tried to get involved in it last semester but the office wasn't super responsive.",

I am waiting to hear back from some other grad programs (funded), but I figured attending the interview would be worth it to at least hear them out. \n\nI appreciate you telling me about your experience. My major is not a huge money-making one, so the additional loans would be detrimental to my finances - I would have to work if I did part-time or full-time at CUNY GC.",

Also, every grad program is pretty different at CUNY so certain ones maybe have individual scholarships or grants that are unique to the major. I'd definitely ask them about anything like that in the interview.\n\nNow, a year into my grad school career, I'm wishing I'd sought out a funded program instead of CUNY. I looked into a few and didn't apply just because CUNY GC is so convenient for me as an NYC resident. Don't end up like me, broke and burnt out!",

I'm not saying it was deceptive exactly, but I am saying that it didn't feel great to realize that at the end of the day, CUNY is a business and they are still trying to \"sell\" these programs to prospective applicants. If I had moved here from out of state, I'd be super disappointed.\n\nAs far as a non-funded graduate program for the out of state tuition price and your relocation costs, I don't know if CUNY GC is worth it. Just want to be real with you about it, and I hope this helps you make a decision that works for you!",

            "comment": "Hi CUNY GC alumnus here. It's almost 15 years ago, but I started with my doctoral with only $10k in my bank account. I was an international student and had very limited employment opportunities. I managed to live my first year with $10k by finding a very cheap room share (it was about $500 in Queens), spending most of my time in the library, and eating at affordable places (there were quite a few cheap places in Korea Town back then). I found several teaching positions at CUNY undergraduate schools in Year 2, which saved me the rest of my time at the GC. I eventually graduated after 7 years without any student debt (I actually saved. a bit by the time I graduated).\n\nYou will find a lot of students with financial constraints at the GC and the program director and the faculty are usually sympathetic with these students (it's not like NYU or Columbia). It's probably the only place where you can pursue graduate-level education in NYC without spending tons of money for your school and city life.",

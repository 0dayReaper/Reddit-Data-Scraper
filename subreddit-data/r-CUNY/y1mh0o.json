Even though COVID has gotten \"better\" since 2020, it feels like the world is still upside down and it sucks. I'm struggling with staying motivated for a lot of things, including school.\n\nEdit: Sorry to see so many of us are feeling this way. Check out what activities and resources your school offers. Some CUNYs are really great with self care resources, super important during this time. Never be afraid to reach out for help, and take care of yourselves y'all. We got this \u2764\ufe0f",

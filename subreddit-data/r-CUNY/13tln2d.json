There were very basic induction and direct proof problems on it. There wasn't even much set theory. Though I do admit the combinatorics section was a bit rough.\n\nIMO, other school's Discrete Structure classes are way harder (in terms of final and coursework). \n\nSource: I just took it this semester.",

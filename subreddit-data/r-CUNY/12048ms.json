Now as for KCC outside of Flex I've had some horrible experiences with Administration and the Language Department. I'm actually planning to do a post to warn students about what I experienced. It was that bad.",

But, honestly, there are some negative aspects to my entire experience so far, which would hopefully be addressed, and solved as a few semesters go by.\n\nI don't know much about KBCC, but I've friends who go there, and it's also a great place as well; you'd have to factor in some things, like programs (Bcc has a great Auto-tech program) and, as xlark said, commute time is one significant factor (one of the reasons I chose to go there).\n\nHere's a link to some of the programs on each campus.\n\nBCC - https://www.bcc.cuny.edu/academics/academic-programs/\n\nKBCC- http://catalog.kingsborough.edu/content.php?catoid=11&amp;navoid=886\n\nI hope this helps. :)",

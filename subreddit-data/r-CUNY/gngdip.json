For many, you guys are the only reason we endure this \"expendable\" (according to the administration) low wage work to begin with. For now, it looks like the plan is to withhold grades until the last day (may 28). Admin has until May 29 to decide on whether or not to renew hundreds (maybe thousands) of adjunct contracts so its basically a way to show solidarity and strengthen our position. At least that's how I see it.",

The point is to screw things up for the administration and NOT to screw things up for the students, at all. \n\nThe hope is that students would be able to understand that, even though it\u2019s incredibly frustrating (understandably so) to get this semester dragged on, it\u2019s equally if not more frustrating to get fired in the middle of a pandemic. The semester was just as bad for the adjuncts and they got left out to dry. The administration is looking to raise tuition again and increase class sizes\u2014 and they did it in a really sneaky and opportunistic way. \n\n\nAs I said, I get your frustration. But if getting unofficial grades would make that frustration go away, then you should just ask for that, and stand in solidarity with your professors who are going through an absolute shit time, who also had family members die, whose lives were also completely shaken by this, and who were fired totally out of nowhere by an administration that also is coming after the students as well.",

A professor's job is to serve the students, so the only pressure they can apply to admin asking them to serve the students is going to be pressure involving the service they give to students.\n\nWe ought to ask ourselves, \"Hold on, shouldn't admin be reasonable, and willing to discuss policies on the basis that they are fair, that best serve the ideals of education, and best serve the long-term sustainability of the academy?\" Unfortunately, the answer to this is, \"They should be, in the sense of some ideal world where everyone does what is best, but in the real world they're not.\"\n\nSo this creates a dilemma. Either professors simply submit without protest to whatever conditions admin wish to impose on them, or else professors protest but this impacts students in some way. I hope you can understand if professors' attitudes about this are that you should be angry at admin for refusing to be reasonable rather than angry at professors for trying to find some way to respond to admin's unreasonableness.\n\nProfessors are overwhelmingly disposed *not* to impact students through protesting. This is a result of selection bias: the working conditions of adjunct professors are so dismal that no one is willing to put up with them unless they're passionately committed to students. Which is how we've arrived at the situation we're presently in, where admin impose on adjunct professors some of the most egregiously unfair working conditions present in our economy, knowing that they can get away with it because the last thing anyone with this passionate commitment to students wants to do is impact their students negatively.\n\nSo admin can sustain these egregiously unfair working conditions by playing professors and students off each other. Even though what's actually happening is that both professors and students get screwed by this. So this status quo is sustained only insofar as no one's organized and reflective enough to notice and respond to what's going on.",

The administration has until May 29th to decide whether to renew contracts for a large contingent of the most vulnerable faculty. Withholding grades until the 28th (the last day) shows solidarity, potentially strengthening the faculty's bargaining position. As of now, many many adjunct layoffs are planned (which could affect the fall courses your classmates already registered for, screwing them over). There has been no talk of administrative pay cuts, finding new revenue, monitoring enrollment, etc. Really, they're going right after the faculty that have the most to lose. \n\nI don't think anyone wants to pit adjuncts against the students--the vulnerable against the vulnerable, parasite style. The admin is already starting to come around after originally unilaterally deciding to decimate the faculty so we'll see what happens.\n\nAlso, I'm sure your prof will tell you what grade you'll be getting if you ask.\n\nEdit: just to clarify, the 28th is the day that grades are officially due.",

The grades I have in the key courses is an B in English , A in sociology, A- in Math and an B in human anatomy . Are these grades good enough to get into the radiology program ? Also I was thinking of transferring to city tech if I didn\u2019t get in, but are my grades good enough to get in the program at LaGuardia ? Does anyone have any experience with getting into the radiology program at LaGuardia or city tech ?",

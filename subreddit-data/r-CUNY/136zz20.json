    "postText": "I\u2019m attending John Jay in the fall as an out of state student. I\u2019m planning on dorming at the towers but I\u2019m having a lot of difficulties. I submitted my application, got an email saying they received it and was told to send them an email with my housing preferences. No problem. I send it, I get an automatic reply saying they received my email and will contact me in 24-48 hours. Keep in mind, this was over a week ago now. I know CUNY is notorious for poor responses so I called them today and explained the situation. The woman asked for my name, and said she couldn\u2019t find the email. She asked for my email, and still to no avail. She said to email them again so I did, but this time I didn\u2019t even get the automatic reply. If I don\u2019t get a reply, I\u2019m going to call them again but I have a feeling this will be an endless cycle. Any clue what to do? I really need somewhere to live and my parents aren\u2019t fans of the other housing options like the New Yorker because they want me on a college campus. Any help is extremely appreciated!!!",

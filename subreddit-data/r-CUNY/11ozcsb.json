    "postText": "I recently graduated from BMCC and I am looking for colleges  I can transfer to and  take classes remotely since I work from home in the mornings. I graduated with an A.S degree in Business Administration. I know BMCC has Articulation agreements with other colleges so from my understanding all  60 credits I took from BMCC will be accepted when I transfer to CUNY School of Professional Studies, Southern New Hampshire University, Pace university and CUNY Medgar Evers. From my research I can earn my bachelor's online from the mentioned colleges. Are there any others? Baruch, Leman, York, etc, where I can transfer and take all my classes online?\n\nThanks in advance for the help! :)",

Last semester a boy in one of my classes had to enroll to an in person English class which was difficult for him , and he was extra pissed because he applied to an online degree. My English prof last semester told us that she and a few other colleagues in her department told the head that they are no longer going to do online courses. CUNY overall has been trying to have more in person classes (idk that\u2019s what some professors say)",

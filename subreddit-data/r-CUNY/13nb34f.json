I\u2019ve emailed and called to no avail.\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

I do not go to BC (City College student, 90 min commute up to Harlem), however, many of my friends go to BC and their commutes are half an hour to 45 mins with the B6 or the 2/5 trains at Flatbush Av.",

Flatbush all the way to Kings Plaza is nice. I would look along the Q/F line for places. Keep in mind some areas are 2 fare zones.",

    "postText": "Ok this has been in my mind for a while and I still can't figure out how elective credit work. So let say, my major required me to take 36 major credits and there are more courses in the major that I'm interested in. Can I still take them? Will the extra courses count as electives or does it have to be non-major related?",

            "comment": "Yes, the extra courses will count as general education electives (though they may show up under your major requirements on degreeworks). In other words, 36 credits is the minimum you need to take in your major, but not the limit.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m a history minor and Degreeworks is telling me that I need to take a 300-level elective course. I took that course last semester but it\u2019s still telling me I need to take a 300-level course. Do I need to contact someone at my school? Because after this semester my minor should be done but it\u2019s telling me that it isn\u2019t because of the requirement?",

    "postText": "It's been more than 2 weeks since I submitted an E-permit, no response. I sent an email to the registrar a week ago, no response. I send one to the E-permit office 5 days ago, no response. I emailed my advisor 5 days ago, no response (on Wednesday). I have no idea if my email has been banned/blocked or isn't working but I haven't gotten ANY response and it's frustrating since classes are getting filled up. What do I do? It's really REALLY frustrating now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Also submitted a new E-permit request a week ago assuming the first one just didn't go through, no response.",

It can take more than 2 weeks especially during end of semesters when everyone is signing up for classes. I had submitted an e-permit end of august and it took nearly a month to be approved. You can reach out to the school you applied to for the epermit as they have to approve it first before host school.",

Also did you confirm before applying that the class was an equivalent and would count towards your degree? You mentioned an advisor so ideally they should have shown you how to check but not all advisors are the same.\n\nEdit:forgot to mention there should also be a phone number for registrars office if you have been unable to reach them by email. Also you can email them using a personal email account if you feel your cuny email is not working",

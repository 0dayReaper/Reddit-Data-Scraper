    "postText": "Theres a student in one of my math classes that tells me he's e-permitting a biology class cause the classes there are really bad. Another student also said he picked QCC over QC for biology for the same reason, and that QC is mainly good for buisness. Is this true? I need opinions as a bio major who was looking to transfer to QC next Spring.\n\nREPOST due to lack of responses",

They throw you for a loop and that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t good science professors, but bio 106 at qc was rough lol. I\u2019m ePermitting orgo for next semester too. Especially since a lot of the people youll meet in these classes want to go into healthcare, professors are a little bit tougher than necessary",

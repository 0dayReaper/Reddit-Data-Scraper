            "comment": "It depends on the loan type. \n\nMost loans start interest free during your time enrolled in college. You can pay the loan back without charged interest. After graduation, you receive a grace period then your loan is to be paid back with interest. \n\nOther loan types, you pay interest free during school then required to pay back with interest after graduation. \n\nOther types, you pay back with interest or default if no-payment. \n\nGovernment ones varies. You can pay back interest free until you fully pay off the loan. \n\nThis would be easier to answer if you told us the loan type you\u2019ll be receiving from financial aid. \n\nThat said, I hope this link helps: [Sallie Mae Loan Types](https://www.salliemae.com/college-planning/student-loans-and-borrowing/compare-federal-vs-private-loans/federal-student-loans/)",

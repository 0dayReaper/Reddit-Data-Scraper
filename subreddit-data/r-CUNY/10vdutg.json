    "postText": "Is it too late to change classes? My school's classes started on 1/25. I want to change a class because one of the classes I'm in is honors and it's already making my brain melt. Should I change or stick with it as it's too late to change now?\n\nAlso: is taking a summer class count as credits the spring semester? I\u2019m in ASAP and I was told that it counts as a separate semester so I would have to take the full 12 credits for spring even if I had enrolled for a summer classes",

As for dropping, I believe the deadline to drop without a W is the 15th (as of now you\u2019d receive a WD which stays off your record and counts as \u201ca program adjustment\u201d). And as far as I know, for Excelsior purposes, Summer counts for the full academic year if catching up on credits is needed (although the requirement is 30 credits a year, so something that specifies credits per semester/session are probably different).\n\nAlso everything said is based on my experience at a senior college, if you\u2019re at a Community College things are probably different as the community colleges and four-year universities operate on separate schedules. So, I agree with the other person, your best bet is to get in contact with people at your school for clarification (I\u2019d recommend the department, the instructors of the classes, and/or the registrar). Good luck!",

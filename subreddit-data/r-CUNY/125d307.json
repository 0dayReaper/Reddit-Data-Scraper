    "postText": "Currently a spring 2023 freshman. Right now I am taking Trigonometry101, Psychology 101, English 101, and bio 101\n\n\nI am doing fine in most my classes, besides math. I find that it requires a lot more effort that I feel overwhelmed and with midterms coming up I find that I don\u2019t think I will do good in this class. My choices are either I drop the class with a W, and retake it in the summer, attempt to pass, or fail with an F grade. \n \nI want to try to pass, but I don\u2019t think I can pass the class with better than a C, Im taking my pre requisites to apply for city tech radiology program, however it seems the requirements are a 3.5 gpa and this C will bring my gpa way down. If I get an F that will destroy my Gpa also. I can withdraw without any affecting my gpa also, but I heard I\u2019ll be required to pay back for the class that I took. My last option was to withdraw, pay back for the class and retake it over the summer so it can be the one class I focus on, however im not sure if Pell or tap will cover the class for me. Does anyone have any options? Or advice on how I should approach this?",

I believe there is something called freshmen forgiveness to have an F removed from a transcript not sure. I recommend you speak to an advisor about this before doing anything figure out what\u2019s the best course of action for you.",

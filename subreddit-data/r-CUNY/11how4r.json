    "postText": "Im studying community healthy right now at KBCC and plan on transferring into a CUNY for food science/nutrition afterwards. I am a smart student but I do have avoidant coping mechanisms and cannot handle work overload. Im a pretty bad test taker but a great writer. I really want to set myself up for success in my choice and not flunk or have problems. Ive thought about Hunter because I know their programs in my related fields are great, but they are competitive. My grades are quite good right now- my classes are fully online though so a CUNY with a big online option would also be good. Thanks so much and I appreciate any feedback/knowledge. \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "Every CUNY is going back to in person learning for the most, if you\u2019re going to a four year senior college, they are all competitive. Going to community college is easier, but the professors aren\u2019t as great. It\u2019s pretty impossible to get a degree without taking exams for the majority of your classes. If you can\u2019t handle work overload, then take less classes or just do part time. Trying to find a CUNY that is easy is a lost cause.\n\nWith your current mindset, you\u2019re setting up yourself for disappointment and failure.",

[check it out here.](https://www.cunysps.online/bachelor.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=undergrad_search&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA0oagBhDHARIsAI-BbgfRqw5Axh59pqNqL8QozHUepRG8z_TU7NstQypUfSCAE1AxTZoeC-kaAnXOEALw_wcB) you can still apply. however one downside is that the programs and courses offered are limited, and the program you want might not be there. it's worth a shot though!! good luck!!",

The [curriculum requirements](https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/nutrition/Undergraduate/bs-in-nutrition-wellness/curriculum-information) seems pretty straightforward (27 credits), you can declare the nutrition major easily there\u2019s no exam prereq/application like in nursing.\n\nEdit: the \u201cnutrition and wellness\u201d major is the new program that is not competitive. The \u201cnutrition and food science\u201d IS competitive (52 credits), only [25-35 students gets accepted each year](https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/nutrition/Undergraduate/bs-in-nutrition-food-science-nfs/admissions-information-bs-1). If you don\u2019t get in to the \u201cnutrition and food sciences\u201d program you can apply to the \u201cnutrition and wellness\u201d for backup.",

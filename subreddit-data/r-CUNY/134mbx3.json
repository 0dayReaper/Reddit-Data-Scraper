    "postText": " \n\nHi everyone,\n\nI applied to CUNY a few months ago and I'm still waiting for them to evaluate my transcripts. I know that the process can take some time, but I'm starting to get a little worried that there might be something wrong with my application.\n\nHas anyone else experienced a long delay in getting their transcripts evaluated by CUNY? If so, how long did it take for you to hear back from them? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether this is a common issue or if there might be something else going on.\n\nAlso, if there's anyone else out there who's currently applying to CUNY and hasn't heard back yet, I'd love to hear from you as well. It's always helpful to know that you're not the only one in this situation!\n\nThanks in advance for any insights or advice you can provide.",

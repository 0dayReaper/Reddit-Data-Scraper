    "postText": "Uhm well, I am going to be a freshman in the fall in Baruch. Does anyone who goes there have any insight or advice going there? What should I avoid, how are the professors and faculty at Baruch? I heard most professors are bad...And idk who I should choose or be wary of. Someone told me to rate my professor isn't trustworthy so idk anymore. Do you really have to join clubs to make friends? How are your classes and workload? I feel like a middle schooler going to high school again. And I was going to be a psych major but I don't plan on going to go on after my bachelor's. So what major do you think would be best? ",

            "comment": "Rate my professor for the most part is trustworthy. Some students do lie though on occasion I\u2019ve had teachers bribe students with a boost in grade to write good reviews and even teachers themselves writing reviews but it\u2019s usually pretty easy to tell when 90 percent of reviews are bad and there\u2019s that select few \u201cstanding up for the teacher\u201d but it\u2019s best to read all the reviews to form your own decision  and ask around. If you\u2019re taking a class that\u2019s for your major for example you can ask other students if a possible class or teacher you plan on taking the next semester is good , does anyone have any experience etc. I\u2019ve done this a few times especially for classes where the teacher has no ratings but is a good professor. You can also ask on Reddit I suppose . Clubs are one way to make friends it\u2019s not the only way. You can open up in your classes, which I recommend always having at least one person in your classes you are acquainted with so if you miss a session for instance you can get the notes. You can join student government etc. This is college so the work will be harder than high school. I don\u2019t think anyone here can tell you what major to pick. What are you passionate about and go based off that or you can be a liberal or undeclared your first semester but i recommend figuring that out early on. As far as psych when you say don\u2019t plan to go on after your bachelors are you referring to grad school or a career using your psych degree ? Every school definitely has bad professors sometimes it\u2019s certain departments over others.",

So idk what major to choose now. I didn't really plan anything other than that. Thanks for the reply",

You can be a case worker, career counselor you can even be a probation or parole officer , rehabilitation specialist teacher etc. You\u2019ll be surprised how many people don\u2019t pursue a masters in psychology after undergrad which is okay. Psychology career isn\u2019t your only option ! I actually have a friend who graduated last semester she\u2019s working as a mental health counselor for a non-profit after she was in a similar position to you deciding not to go into grad school for psych anymore because  she would need a phd to do clinical psych and she\u2019s happy with what she\u2019s doing now",

I find psychology interesting but for the sake of myself I also don\u2019t want to get into something I\u2019ll regret later yknow? And idk how college works so I was a bit nervous on what to decide for my major. A lot of people are business majors so they can\u2019t really tell me much of their personal experience in this field and the professors. I know school isn\u2019t going to be a perfect experience but it would be better for myself if my professor wasn\u2019t ass. One person says this and another says something completely different. I guess I\u2019ll just have to see when I\u2019m actually there",

Hopefully some psych majors at Baruch see this and can offer you an inside perspective but there definitely is options for you outside of being a psychologist so I don\u2019t think you should let that deter you. I also recommend posting this in the Baruch thread also. As far as how college works people change their major all the time it\u2019s a common thing but it\u2019s good that you want to decide on what you should major in now before starting. Hope everything works out for you !",

Are there any in this sub? \n\nContext: I'm working with a local researcher to explore the possibility of designing a research project to look at the experiences of food delivery cyclists in NYC who are **female**. They exist, but are not always the most visible and accessible group.\n\nAny leads greatly appreciated. Feel free to DM to discuss!",

I became a member in 2018 and haven\u2019t looked back since. To get the full benefits of your membership you\u2019d have to be outgoing and connect with other members at other chapters and seek out opportunities. \n\nThey take your money and engage you towards becoming a member then things go cold. 5 years later and I literally forgot about it until I saw this post. \n\nThey do however host a cute ceremony for inducted members at the end of the semester which makes you feel nice.",

I understand this is my fault for forgetting but I\u2019m not ranting about that. I\u2019m just so upset at the fact we still need to do these NON-OPTIONAL Covid tests. God, now I\u2019m standing out in the cold waiting for the testing site to open in 1 hr and 30 mins.\n\nThis is so stupid. I\u2019m tired of this. When will these end?",

            "comment": "I agree. It's absurd. I'm taking my classes mostly online/hybrid and last semester I got an email for random testing. Well guess what, when I'm not in class I work Monday to Friday, til 7pm, in a completely different part of the city from where any of the CUNY testing centers are. So I emailed and told them that, and told them I would happily supply one of my employer-required Covid tests I get free at work every week. But nope, they wouldn't accept that, and they couldnt accept that me, an immunocompromised person who's double vaxxed and boosted, wouldn't want to go all the way to their fucking testing centers. So instead, they wanted me to take off work, losing an entire day's worth of pay to do this. Man, fuck that.\n\nI had a back and forth email with the Cleared4 guy and basically told him to go fuck himself and I would send them an invoice for my lost wages if I had to miss work to go in person already. I emailed my professors and asked if I could finish the semester up online (my classes were online or hybrid already) and they said yes. Then I finished the semester and decided to not ever enroll in a CUNY class again. Their bullshit lost them my tuition. I read that they had a $3mil contract with the company that does the testing. What a waste of fucking money",

But it\u2019s good for nothing alone.\nAlso, I shall add this: with associate engineering science you\u2019re at freshmen/ sophomore level at 4year school. You\u2019ll have a long grueling road ahead of you. \n\nIf I was u, I\u2019d just pick an associate degree, stick with it and transfer to 4years.",

Economics at BMCC is an A.A degree and Engineering is a A. S degree. I\u2019m sure their website has admission counselors contact  and ask about it.",

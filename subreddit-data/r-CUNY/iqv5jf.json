My mom worked at American Airlines at JFK and I was slowly losing it until I she picked me up... I begged her not to go back to work because I feared it can happen in the airports. My dad was working around WTC and his coworker came back into the office covered in soot and in shock... he walked from lower manhattan (as trains weren\u2019t working) to Brooklyn and I was on the phone with him until his arms got tired from holding the phone.",

On that day a school aide burst into our classroom and pointed at the Twin Towers saying they were on fire. I remember being in a state of shock and looking away. When I looked back, the towers were gone leading to more shock. Eventually the smell reached us in Brooklyn and it was awful. They brought us down to the cafeteria where they had us wait for our parents to pick us up. My dad left work early and brought me home but I remember other students were stuck there and feeling uneasy because their parents were first responders.",

And seeing my teachers walk out of the class room only to come back crying. 10 minutes later my mother showed up as well as many parents to pick up their kids. \n\nI thought two planes crashed on top of the world center, like a car crash. I was like wow wtf. Until i got home 1 block away, my father and mother left my sister and i at home while they went to pick up my other two sisters. I was watching cartoons, until i realize the face of my parents as they left. I was watching fairly oddparents, then i turned to the news channel...when i saw what was happening. My god!  When i saw people jumping out on live tv i remember i started crying. \n\nWhen i went outside in the afternoon to buy some items. I saw people just walking, with their head down, sad. People barely spoke, buses full, cars barely moving. It way the quietest saddest day i seen in NY.",

My dad was supposed to go to WTC to visit a friend there, but I think he said he didn\u2019t even get pass JFK while he heard what had happened on the radio. So my dad turned back and came to pick me up from school early and my mom was stuck in Manhattan, luckily she was on the other side of the island. But I remember when they completely shutdown the city and there was no way for her to leave, so her boss let her stay at their home. \n\nAt that time I wasn\u2019t foreign to hearing about foreign terror attacks, because I think it was around that time when the UK was experiencing them quite frequently and we always called my family who lives there because of it. But I remember being quite scared because, my mom was still in Manhattan and with everything going on no one really knew if there was more to come; like in the form of bombings and such.",

            "comment": "Well, since I\u2019m the oldest CUNY student in history (not really but feel like it sometimes), I was at work across the street from Penn Station. at 8:48 AM my coworker came over to me and said you\u2019re not gonna believe this but there was an accident a plane just hit the World Trade Center at that point it was just one plane, and we thought it was an accident. He\u2019s like I think a few people were killed and we were like oh wow that\u2019s too bad it\u2019s so sad! Ok back to work. The same coworker came over to me a few minutes later and said another one hit. I stared at him. Voice came over the loudspeaker and said everybody stay in your seats it\u2019s nothing continue working. I looked at my coworker and without a word I picked up my purse &amp; said \u201cSEE ya sucka\u2019s out of here\u201d even though they hadn\u2019t  announced it yet after plane 2 I knew it was terrorism. Also there was a lot of that terrorism shit happening on the news small scale stuff but it was on my radar. So it was pretty clear the second # 2 hit that that\u2019s what happened. My moron supervisor was like you can\u2019t just walk out I was like fire me bye! I leave the building and even though we were on 34th St. the whole street was covered in smoke it was so bad that it came up all the way to 34th St. And ashes from the fuel were flying around in the middle of the street like confetti. On friggin 34th. The subways were already closed so were the buses. Even though it was only like 10 minutes later there were MASSES of people on the street all running around trying to find transportation everyone freaking out &amp; panicking. If anyone\u2019s ever seen a Godzilla movie where the whole Tokyo is running around screaming in a panic that\u2019s exactly what 34th St. &amp; 8th Avenue looked like. Then the fire dept came on the loudspeaker and said 8th Avenue just opened up for pedestrians only, closed to vehicles- anyone that lives uptown - start walking because that\u2019s the only way you can get home Duane Reade will be open and giving out water and batteries for free so anytime you see a DR will be a station just stop there get a drink and continue moving on your way. It took me about 3 hours to walk home to 75th St. and that\u2019s only because I kept stopping to drink water &amp; talk to people. Pretty soon we started seeing all those shellshocked men in suits who were actually walking up from the World Trade Center who survived. So now it\u2019s a couple hours later &amp; we all listening to transistor radio\u2018s &amp; boomboxes people who lived in the apartments we were passing, would all come downstairs with radios &amp; boomboxes so all the walkers would know what\u2019s going on-so every time you saw someone with a radio you would stop and listen for a few minutes. And we\u2019re listening to the newscaster saying \u201cwe are standing on 8th Ave solemnly watching the men in suits walking like zombies with ashes on their face and burnt briefcases\u201d and as they were saying those words on the news - we were seeing those men right in front of us - was the freakiest thing ever - every time we saw one of those guys in suits with their burnt briefcase everyone on the street would start applauding and cheering &amp; the men would just stand there and cry not just tears but sobbing like little babies it was extremely sad. And then people would just come up to them and hug them when they started crying and then they would start hugging them back hugging a total stranger really tight not letting go. Every one of them was clutching a burnt briefcase for dear life like it was the thing that was keeping them alive it was so sad. It was surreal I still have nightmares &amp; it still seems like yesterday.",

So my pregnant mom ran back to the apartment with two 2 kids and groceries. When she got home she said she tried to call my grandma but phones weren\u2019t working and the cable stopped working shortly after she got home. She said that was the scariest day of her life just not being able to contact anyone or be able to hear what was going on outside.",

I had to go to after school daycare after that because my parents worked. Everything still seemed weird and adults were whispering to each other and all the lights were off. I wasn\u2019t really told what happened until my mom picked me up at my regular time that day around 5pm. I remember knowing it was a big deal but being only around 7 I didn\u2019t really give it much thought until I was older. I never met or knew anyone who was in NYC during 9/11 until I met my girlfriend who\u2019s cousins worked in nearby buildings on that morning.",

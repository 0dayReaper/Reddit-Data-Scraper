    "postText": "Hey guys, does any know or whoever is taking this summer semester know under what school year this one falls into for financial aid? Is it for the 2023-2024 school year or the 2022-2023 school year? Because I have not been getting covered for this semester and I really cannot afford the price, which was like $3k, so I panicked and dropped them and now I owe $1k, and also I wanna know if I reenroll in the exact same class I dropped, will I owe $4k? Or how does it work?",

I would suggest speaking with your FA office ASAP to see if you can try to readd those summer courses. If you can Pell could be reinstated and the tuition charges will be as they were when you first registered.",

If you re-enroll in the classes again your charges will just go back to the original tuition amount. Before you add the classes reach out to your FA office and see if addi g those classes again will have your financial aid reinstated or if you even had financial aid in the first place.",

And no, I was not being covered by FAFSA, which caused me to panic drop all my classes, but now I want them back, but don\u2019t wanna pay extra. It\u2019s so frustrating too because in queens college it\u2019s almost impossible to reach out to any department when it matters. It takes them 5 million years to reply. Sorry for the rant.",

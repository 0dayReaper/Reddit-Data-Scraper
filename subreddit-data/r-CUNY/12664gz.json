    "postText": "Hello\n\nMy niece recently immigrated to NYC from Ukraine. She is looking to apply to college but here English is not at a 100% level of fluency. She did finish HS in Ukraine with honors, though, and has been taking English courses here for a few months now. \n\nI am hoping you guys can shed some light on what she\u2019ll be needing to take to get into CUNY. Names of the tests would be great.  \n\nThank you.",

Students interested in English Language study should visit the individual college websites to find out which CUNY colleges have an English Language Institute(ELI) and/or programs in English as a Second Language (ESL).\n\nHere's the link I copied this info from, it goes into more detail about other requirements: https://www.cuny.edu/academics/academic-programs/international-education/isss/#1484843376486-11e774f2-e5f455e6-7695\n\nIf you need any more info let me know!",

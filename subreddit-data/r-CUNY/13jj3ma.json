I stumbled upon Hostos Community College and its history of providing English learning opportunities for bilingual students. They used to provide a range of class sections in Spanish up until 20 years ago. Now they have just a few. I wanted to know if anyone in this reddit community had thoughts about this situation.\n\nI've already spoken to a few students. You can check out their takeaways here:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 [https://medium.com/@angeles.rodriguez11/i-spoke-to-bilingual-students-at-hostos-community-college-about-the-offered-resources-122dfec55d49](https://medium.com/@angeles.rodriguez11/i-spoke-to-bilingual-students-at-hostos-community-college-about-the-offered-resources-122dfec55d49)\n\nI wanna hear from you!",

    "postText": "Hello,\n   So I had no choice but to take summer classes to graduate on time next year, and not have to stay for a full year again. But, I was able to get full Pell grant and I will have about 400$ remaining left. Right now, I have I can\u2019t pay till maybe July 1st, about 10 days before the Pell disburses. I\u2019m wondering will anything happen if I just wait for my Fall refund and pay it? Has anyone else had experience with this, or any Tips? I\u2019m just panicking haha. I was told I wouldn\u2019t be dropped for non payment. But I really would not be able to pay it till fall.",

    "postText": "I am a single mother from Mongolia. In 2018, I took a leap and started my own business importing SME equipment from European countries. Initially, the business was thriving, and I obtained a loan of $50,000 from a Non-Banking Financial Institution, using my own apartment as collateral. Unfortunately, due to the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, my business came to a complete halt, and I found myself unable to repay the loan.\n\nLast year, I managed to secure a loan from an individual to pay off a portion of the debt, but now, they are requesting full repayment by June. In addition to this financial burden, my son is currently studying in United States. While he has received grants totaling $190,000, I am still responsible for covering his living expenses, which amount to $20,000 per year. He is now in his fourth year of studies.\n\nRegrettably, due to my low credit score, I have been unable to secure any further loans from financial institutions in my country. I find myself in a desperate situation and am uncertain about where to turn for assistance. I humbly request any support or guidance you can provide.\n\nThank you for your attention and consideration.\n\nSincerely yours,",

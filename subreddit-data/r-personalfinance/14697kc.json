    "postText": "Hi,\n\n  \nI just want to retire, preferably before I'm 60. I'm 37, no kids, still paying down mortgage and new to investing. I don't have a ton of excess money, but can afford to max all 3 accounts for the moment. Are the following ETFS and mutual funds a good plan?\n\n  \nTaxable: ITOT/VXUS  \nRoth: FZROX  \nHSA: VT  \nAny help is appreciated. TIA.",

    "postText": "Okay y\u2019all, I finally opened a Roth IRA after thinking about it for a few years (why it took me so long.. I don\u2019t know) and I\u2019ve got $2,500 in it so far. \n\nI have absolutely no idea what I\u2019m doing but my understanding is that I\u2019m supposed to be using that money to invest in the stock market? And I know nothing about the stock market. I\u2019ve pretty much just been looking into different things on my lunch break and haven\u2019t devoted a lot of time to learning yet, which I know I need to do. But since I\u2019ve already got money in my IRA, I\u2019d like to know which stocks I should be spending that money on, so my money isn\u2019t just sitting doing nothing. \n\nAlso if anyone has any suggestions for knowledgeable YouTubers or anything I could start following regarding this topic, it would be much appreciated!\n\nEdit - Roth IRA is through Charles Schwab",

You didn\u2019t state who your broker is, but find their target date offerings are and pick the one with the date closest to your retirement age. Now, I feel they generally have too much in bonds, so I\u2019d personally get the furthest out date one and switch every 5yrs to the furthest out date at that time.  \n  \nOtherwise you have your popular choices of doing S&amp;P 500 funds, US Total Market funds,  a mix of large/mid/small cap funds, as well as international funds (and bond funds and real estate fund; as well as a lot more, I have some in a technology fund and a semiconductor fund).",

I\u2019ll definitely look into their Target Date thing. \n\nAlso, when I was setting up my account, it asked me if I wanted to make the account available for \u201climited margin\u201d and I wasn\u2019t sure what that was so I said no, as well as opting out of something that sounded a bit higher risk (something to do with trading, I believe) but I can go back and change those options if that would be a good move. I\u2019ve heard S&amp;P 500 is good so I\u2019ll probably start there. Man I wish all this was still taught in high school lol",

            "comment": "So the most important thing to remember about a Roth, is that you do not pay taxes on your gains when you cash out in retirement. This also means of course that you don\u2019t get to use losses against other investments. In other words, for most people at least, you don\u2019t to make your Roth a risky portfolio.\n\nInvest 100% in major index funds like QQQ (tracks the NASDAQ index) or VOO (tracks the S&amp;P 500) or other similar index fund ETFs or mutual funds. These are collections of stocks so you have a diverse portfolio and are not risking your retirement on one company. A good way to set it and forget it. Do not panic sell, buy and hold for retirement. The return on broad index funds is all but guaranteed over a long time horizon.\n\nThen as you get older, and have a shorter time horizon, remove risk from your portfolio by moving some of your investment to bonds or other investments that pay dividends or interest, albeit at a lower return than the average. In other words, as you get closer to retirement you will want to focus more on investments that protect your savings and keep up with inflation, but offer extremely low risk.\n\nTLDR: Invest in index funds like VOO that tracks the SP500 index or VTI that tracks the whole stock market, or mutual funds that do the same. That is a very low risk strategy over a long time horizon. Worry about shortening your time horizon later on.",

    "postText": "hi! about a year ago i (24) started my first corporate job making 62k a year. i still live at home so i keep my monthly bills pretty low, and have managed to save up 32k as of right now. i\u2019ve been working on contributing $200 a month to my roth and a little bit more about 7% to my 401k. anyway the company i work for just announced they will contribute $100 a month to student loans for any individual. i currently have exactly 20k in student loans. my plan was to pay these off as soon they go back into effect next month. but now i\u2019ve been reconsidering if this is why with the company match. my payment would only be about $200 a month, so the match would be half. i could even pay off some of the higher interest loans to bring down the monthly payment to closer to $100 so the company would pay almost the entire bill? i just am so reluctant to basically drain my savings for the loans (even though fully aware i took them out i will pay them). my question is what makes the most sense? pay them off fully so im entirely debt free or make the small monthly payment with my company match so i maintain my savings for potentially a big purchase in my future? - also fully aware if i don\u2019t pay them off and want to leave my company and there for the payment match my loans will most likely be higher with the accrued interest.",

            "comment": "Without knowing anything about the interest rates, it does sound like a tempting deal since it is essentially free money.  You should just do the math to see how much you would pay if you went solely with the employer match vs just paying it off as quick as possible.  The money that you save from lowering your payments you could save and if you change employers you can just put that money towards the loans.",

Paying off those loans will be a huge step in the right direction for your long-term financial health.\n\nBeing debt-free at your age will be amazing! Plus, what happens when you leave your current employer in 2 to 3 years for the next best thing and you still have these loans laying around while you\u2019re trying to do other things like move out, save for a home purchase, etc.",

A mortgage is the only debt you should ever have to carry. Every other consumer debt is dead weight. Plus paying it off will free up more cash for your monthly budget.",

    "postText": "Hello smart people.  \n\nI have a personal IRA with Schwab.  I originally opened a traditional account but have started investing in my Roth, with the plan of backdooring my traditional IRA into my Roth.  \n\nI also have a 401k with my company and contribute 5% to a Roth 401 and 5% to a traditional as I was unsure which was best for me.  \n\nIs this dumb?  I am making the most money I\u2019ve made in my career and am unsure what my tax bracket will be when I retire.  Everything I listen to and see, seems to hint at going the Roth route.  Im just tired of being split. Any advice would be appreciated!",

Both accounts grow tax free, but the IRA is pre tax dollars, meaning no taxes on them, whereas the Roth IRA is post tax dollars.  You need to make more money to contribute to the Roth.\n\nif my income is $100,000 and I put $6000 into my IRA, my gross is now $94,000.  \n\nIf my income is $100,000 and I put $6000 into my Roth IRA I had to use about $7500 of my gross, so now my gross is $92,500.  \n\nIf I go the IRA path, I have $1500 more to use to put into other investments, such as a stocks or mutual funds.  Of course, I pay 25% taxes on the 1500 so that is $1125 to invest in something else.\n\nAn IRA allows you to invest $7125 compared to the $6000 you did in the Roth IRA.\n\nOver a timeframe of 30 plus years, that $7125 will far outpace the $6000.",

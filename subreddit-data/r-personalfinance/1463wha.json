Credit cards don't carry a money balance on it unless you meant credit.\n\n&gt;My credit card expires in 2026, for some reason I can\u2019t use it says the credit card is expired or invalid\n\nDid you activate the card? Was a new card issued? There isn't much we could do other than you need to call the card issuer to sort the issue out.",

Log in to the card\u2019s website and see.\n\nIf it is a debit card, perhaps there is no more money in your bank account. Log into you bank\u2019s website.\n\nEither way, perhaps there are charges you forgot about  or worse, that are fraudulent.",

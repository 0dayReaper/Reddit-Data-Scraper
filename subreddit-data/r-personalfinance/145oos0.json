You can do it, but it hurts.\n\nIf a plan allows it, you can take a 401k loan up to 50k for any reason. The exact details will depend on the specific 401k. The interest rates are usually fairly good, and you pay it back into the same 401k, to yourself. What you lose is the ability to contribute, so all matching until it\u2019s paid back, and the potential growth of the money, so roughly 10% APR.",

Loan down payment, offer cost different beyond appraisal cost, fixing a leaky pipe, etc.?\n\nEssentially, we need to come up with a 50k additional payment that our loan of 950k doesnt cover based off the $1mil purchase price. We're trying to not tap into our emergency savings account as much as possible and trying to find funds from elsewhere.",

I have 20k in my savings, and I can pull 10k from my roth, we're just trying to avoid using savings if we can because that can be used for anything (broken pipes, etc.) Whereas the roth can be taken for a home purchase, so I'd rather pull 10k from roth and 10k from savings instead of all 20k from savings.\n\nI'm just trying to figure out if the roth \"first home purchase\" qualification can be used to cover that additional pay before appraisal value, or if it's only towards the loan down payment",

Home price appreciation, and thus equity growth, has slowed considerably in the last year (from May 2022 to May 2023). Plan for at least 3 to 5 years of owning this house for the appraisal gap to be converted into equity. The US housing market will likely be trading sideways to slightly negative because of the nutty appreciation occurring from 2020 to mid 2022.",

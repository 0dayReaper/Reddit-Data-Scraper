Essentially it comes down to having about 2 weeks worth of clothes, plus formal and cold weather, that I keep for each season. \n\nI'm not into fashion much and have trouble with colors. Jeans can be used almost anytime and 2-3 will last a week. Solid-colored t-shirts are cheap(er) and 1 pack of each of the 4 basic colors (black, blue, white, gray) can last a year or more. I like button-down shirts with long sleeves because you can always wear them in warm or chilly circumstances by rolling up your sleeves and can switch out the undershirt to add variability. This gets me to the light sweaters - 2 or 3 and can be added to undershirts or button-downs to add variety. --- that's 20 items of clothes that can last an entire year. ",

I did this and sent probably 2/3 of everything I owned to charity.\n\nThe other really useful hint was to make sure everything in your house has a \"home\", so when you tidy up everything goes away nearly. And if you put stuff away as you use it you never get clutter.",

And CarMax really isn't all that bad.\n\nIs it less than you can get on your own?  Sure.  Of course it is.  \nIs it *so much* less that you're stupid to do it?  Not in my experience. \n\n$1,000 to avoid a dozen joy-riders, time-wasters, low-ballers,  literally hundreds of emails/texts, and countless hours of my time to *maybe* make more money in a week or two?  And then have to deal with title transfer, worry whether the buyer did everything they were supposed to to properly register the car, etc.  For me, that's $1K well-spent.\n\nAnother way to go that I've had great success with as long as you have a very late-model vehicle in good shape, is using KBB to get offers from nearby dealerships.   It's very nearly as easy as CarMax but you can get even better pricing since they know they're competing with one another.   I'd say better than half the time I get an offer from a dealer more than I was going to ask for it myself.\n\nIn rough figures in my experience, vehicles 1-4 years old do best when sold to a big-name dealer who also runs a used car lot.  4-8 years old do better when sold to CarMax.  And anything over 8 years old, unless you REALLY hate selling to people, just sell yourself as CarMax will usually just offer you an extremely low-ball offer as they aren't likely to sell it on their lot, and will send direct to action (they technically draw the limit at 10 years, but you need something in high-demand for them to be that interested beyond ~8years).",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n- $500 total revenue from 4 items\n- $65 less from a buyer that didn't pay\n- $125 in partial refunds because the buyer complained about something or another and it was easier to issue a partial refund than to pay for return shipping\n- $50 in fees (might get back $6.50 from the non-paying buyer)\n- $20 in extra shipping costs and supplies (even though I got most of the stuff from the recycling bins in the alley)\n\nSo after all of that work I made $240, most of which was from the PS3. I should have donated the PS3 to a hospital then chucked the rest. As another poster said, I'm time-poor not money-poor.\n\nBut to each their own, not everybody has the same priorities.",

My parents could never afford allowance, so the general mentality was always \"if you want new stuff you might have to be willing to part with your old stuff\". It wasn't like a mandatory thing, just something we knew we'd probably have to do if we wanted that new game or toy when it came out. I can't even count how many hours I've probably spent trading in old movies, clothes, games, books, and action figures for cash or store credit growing up or just selling to people online. It was honestly a good way of decluttering our rooms, making money, and I feel it's helped me avoid some hoarder-ish tendencies I may have otherwise had. ",

    "postText": "I live in Denver, HCOL city. I\u2019m saving diligently for a house. In 5 or so years I would like to own a nicer townhome in a good location that I currently couldn\u2019t afford bc I would need a lot more to put down to make the monthly expenses make sense.\n\nI was thinking of buying a cheaper condo, but don\u2019t know if I should just keep renting and saving. I\u2019d want to own the condo 3-5 years. The condo would cost more than renting but I\u2019d be building equity. Is 3-5 years too short of a timeline? Is it better to just keep renting?",

            "comment": "There is a case to be made of doing a Total US Market (VTI, FSKAX, etc.) instead of doing the S&amp;P 500. Now, both are market-cap weighted so they are close (I think Apple is 7.5% of S&amp;P 500 and 6.5% of US Total Marker), but you get some access to small &amp; mid companies. Another option is to do S&amp;P 500 / Large cap and add in a mid cap and a small cap, that way you can adjust the % of each to what you want.  \n  \nThere is also a popular suggestion to get some international market (Total or just larger ones), as else-wise you only have US companies. The popular Vanguard ones are VXUS, VTIAX, VEU; for Fidelity some are FTIHX and FSPSX.",

            "comment": "Have you explored the wiki?  The reason I ask is that you put a brokerage ahead of a Roth.   There is, generally speaking, a bit of a consensus on the order of operations for funding various accounts.   My personal opinion is that the HSA should be more prioritized, but overall the Prime Directive flowchart and the wiki are sound reasoning.\n\nIf you want to make it complex, you can.   But most who do lose out to those who KISS.   If you like VOO, great.   If you want more diversity, VTI+VXUS is a solid pairing.   We only offer opinion here, btw.  Not advice.   We aren't advisors :)",

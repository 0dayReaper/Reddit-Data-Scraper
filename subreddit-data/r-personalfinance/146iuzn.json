Retirement may well have zero taxable income, negative market growth, and you still go on vacation.\n\nSomewhere between 0% and infinitely more. It\u2019s definitely a real, non-negative number. But only because I can\u2019t come up with a way to profit from vacation.\n\nSerious answer: yes to the above. What you can spend on vacation is the personal part of personal finance.",

There is no objective  need for everyone to wear a raincoat.  Similarly you ought (should) only spend a certain amount on a vacation because of some goal you have...it is subjective not objective so no way to answer you.\n\nSo...you ought to not spend more than $X on a vacation because....what?  Thats for you to fill in, I dont know what your personal goals are.",

The answer really depends first on whether you can afford to take a vacation at all and second how much value you place on vacations. At the end of the day, vacations are a luxury and If you don\u2019t have the additional funds to pay for it in cash you probably shouldn\u2019t take one.",

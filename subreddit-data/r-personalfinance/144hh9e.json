    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am a foreigner living in Czechia and I have started saving some money that I would like to invest somehow related to my bank. I went to the bank who gave me some options like locking account for a year in the bank with a 4.8% interest (but 15% tax at the end of it) and mutual funds (conservative and aggressive). A friend of mine has a locked account in the same bank and has 9% interest, supposedly because he has been using it for 4 years and due to his risk level, etc. Is that true? The more you leave the money in, the bigger the interest goes every year, regardless if it falls for newcomers, etc? The banker didn't mention anything like this, so I am not sure what to trust and if in the end I'll lose money instead of gaining or if I'd lose a good opportunity because of my ignorance.\n\nIf anyone has any idea about investing in Czechia, can someone please help me decide what are the best options? Thank you! :)",

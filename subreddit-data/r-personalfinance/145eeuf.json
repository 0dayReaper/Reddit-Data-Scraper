    "postText": "In the past the recommendation given on this subreddit is to always get it because \u201cit\u2019s so cheap and provides huge bang for your buck when you need it.\u201d I\u2019ve been shopping around for my annual leap to a different auto insurer. Everywhere I\u2019ve been quoted, the breakdown is lopsided in cost to the uninsured motorist (UM). \n\nFor example, without discounts, the policy I was offered from State Farm is $1,004/6 months. For the breakdown, the liability coverage is $100k/$300k and costs $246/ 6 month. The UM coverage is $441 (same values). Even if I drop it to the minimums of $10k/$20k, I am only saving $20/month. What gives? I\u2019ve been using these values for years and years but UM cost seems to have really ramped up over the years. \n\nIs this the norm now? An agent explained that many people opt out of UM now because due to the \u201cbasic no fault\u201d package they provide, you would have to deplete your that policy no fault coverage, then your personal health insurance costs, and **then** you\u2019d be able to dip into UM only if the other person was at fault and under insured/ran/etc. \n\nI live in an area full of college kids, so I need good liability coverage but I get excellent health and disability coverage from work. I also rarely have people outside of my policy in my car. Would it still be worth it to get UM in my case?",

My bill has never been so high and I\u2019m neurotic about shopping around between auto insurance providers so they never really jack up my prices and when they try a competitor is always ready to offer me \u201cnew customer\u201d prices but places like State Farm apply loyalty rewards even if you\u2019re not insured with them the whole time. I have like 10 year loyalty rewards across 3 major providers but get \u201cnew customer\u201d prices essentially every year. \n\nThis time all of them have jumped. Co-workers were talking about how they\u2019ve had to raise their deductibles and lower coverage to offset the cost but I\u2019m so paranoid it\u2019s been rough for me to budge.",

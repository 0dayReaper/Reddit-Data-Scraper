    "postText": "I have a job in O&amp;G makes appx. $110k a year with great benefits (employer match, employer profit share, pension, full family medical, dental, vision, gym membership). Wife is a teacher, makes appx $47k.  \n\n6 years ago I started a pressure washing business and could never be very profitable although it got larger than anticipated (appx $300k a year gross not net).  I had worker problems a couple years back so I got rid of them and just continued staining decks and fences on the weekends; got some guys to help. Again, not that profitable.  Lately I\u2019m tired of seeking help, so I\u2019m doing myself on weekends.  Finally profitable.  Made $9k net in two months.  I average $100 an hour doing it myself \u201cin my pocket\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s the dilemma, I\u2019m very good at it, but I\u2019m tired (35 years old and worked since 15) and I have my first child due end of July.\n\nWe could always use the money.  Only debt we have is $300k on a house.  Our monthly expenses are about $7k right now (including extra investments), bring home is about $9,500.",

While more income is (almost) always better, once you have the financial basics covered you will miss the extra money less than you will miss your family.  \n\nPerhaps keep the business alive on life support - if you have a short term need for cash, pick up a job or two to plug the holes.\n\nI was fortunate to have a partial WFH job while my kids were growing up and I would not trade the time spent together for anything.  I can\u2019t imagine working a normal job + side job unless absolutely necessary to keep the wolves at bay.",

My only advice is that working the weekends is pointless if you just spend money to pay for what you don't have time to do yourself. It's easy to not watch your spending when you work all the time, and that's just more time you have to work. I don't live to work anymore. Never again. I just work the 40 because I'd be fired for less. I'd do 3 days a week if I could.",

            "comment": "Two thoughts here.\n\n9K net in 2 months at the rate of $100 an hour means that it was 10-11 hours average per week.\n\nIf you do have the option to scale up (and you mentioned a 300K a year gross) and do it full time (say 40 hours a week); that's around 17K a month net or around 200K per year; much more than the job. Even if you offset the value of benefits, that may be a better earner.\n\nSo two questions\n\n1) Can you scale up to that level (or even more, if you can figure out how to get additional workers and still remain profitable)?\n\n2) Do you want to scale up - run this as a business full time and getting out of the job?\n\n\nIf you DON'T want to run it as a business - and are comfortable financially with your job + wife's job + anticipated expenses when you have your child - then it's a choice of whether you want more money or more time.\n\n\n&gt; Our monthly expenses are about $7k right now .. and I have my first child due end of July.\n\nIf your expenses are already at 7K (including additional investments) - keep in mind that after your child is born, expenses will be significantly higher. Daycare (with both of you working, that may become necessary); baby needs (diapers / pediatric formula / pediatric care etc.) and other expenses.\n\nYou may end up having to cut out the \"extra investments\" and possibly run negative vs your takehome of 9500. \n\n\n\nNot an easy decision. \n\nThe other part you need to figure out. Sounds like the work is inherently profitable AND has a demand; the challenge is hiring workers and still making a profit. If you can crack that part - you may be able to do both your job AND run the side hustle.",

If you want to base it solely on hourly wage (I know, not realistic, but roll with it...), you should quit the day job and expand the side hustle into a full time hustle. Look at more than the hourly wage. Lots of \"gotchas\" hidden in there, in both scenarios.",

I'm excited about doing something that I control 100% but I am setting a limit to two days per month. Numerous factors went into that decision, but most importantly, I don't want to take too much time away from family and I don't want to burn myself out.\n\nMaybe setting a limit to how many days or hours per week/month might help?",

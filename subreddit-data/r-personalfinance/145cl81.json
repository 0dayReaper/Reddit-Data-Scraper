    "postText": "Good afternoon. I need to pick an investment fund for work and I have absolutely no idea what to choose. I can't stress enough the lack of knowledge I have when it comes to investing. It completely goes over my head no matter how hard I try to educate myself. \n\nThese are the choices I have. I tried looking each one up but I really don't have a clue what I am looking for. Should I pick one to invest all 100% in or should I spread it out and pick a few? I've had my choice for years as Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund. I can't begin to tell you why. It's just the one I picked. It doesn't seem to be doing too well for me so I wanted to look at my options but I don't know how to go about knowing which one is better than others. Could anyone give me their opinion on what you would choose from this list and maybe explain to me (as simply as possible) why you would pick that option?

            "comment": "&gt; American Funds Trgt Date Ret  \n  \nTarget Date funds are set it and forget it. They usually invest in US stocks/bonds and international stocks/bonds (sometimes some other stuff like real estate), and every year they change the % they are in each, usually they are stock heavy at the start and slowly get more bond heavy. They dates on them are based on when you want to retire.   \n  \n_____  \n  \n&gt; Vanguard Large Cap Index Adm B  \n  \nThis is sort of like an S&amp;P 500 fund.  \n  \n____  \n&gt; I really don't have a clue what I am looking for  \n  \nBesides seeing what make them up, the yearly fee (net expense ratio) and the yearly annualized gains are the main thing. You can see that Vanguard Large Cap Index Adm B  has a 0.05% yearly fee (5\u00a2 per $100) and the 5yr/10yr annualized performance is +10.80% / +11.84%. Your current choice of Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund is a 0.07% yearly fee and 5yr/10yr annualized performance is +8.18% / +10.03%.  \n  \nLarge Cap / Mid Cap / Small Cap refer to how valued the company is (Apple is #1 with a market cap of $2.8T, Microsoft is next at $2.4T).  \n  \nGrowth means people think it is currently undervalued and can perform better than the general market.  \n  \nSo, Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund invested in 160 mid-cap companies (looks like $5M-$350M) that are expected to grow more than the current market.  \n  \n____  \n  \nWhat you don\u2019t have access to is a \u201cTotal US Market\u201d fund, which is a mix of all 3 types (technically there are more, like micro). You can manually make your own, either of your choosing, or just approximate a popular one (Vangaurd\u2019s one is like 80% Large Cap, 20% Mid Cap, and 20% Small Cap), you can future break it down into growth/value too if you wish. Many people also suggest having international stock, like around 20%, so if following all these percentages it would be something like:  \n  \n\u2022 50% Vanguard Large Cap Index Adm B  \n\u2022 15% iShares Russell Mid-Cap Index K  \n\u2022 15% Vanguard Small-Cap Index Adm B  \n\u2022 20% American Funds Intl Gr &amp; Inc R6  \n  \nOr again, play around with the %s, maybe mix some of the Mid-cap growth &amp; value options, etc. You can also add bonds if you wish.  \n  \nOr, use a Target Date to set it and forget it. But again, I personally think they are a bit too conservative, so I\u2019d pick the furthest out date and switch to the new furthest out option every 5yrs or so, but that\u2019s just me.",

However it doesn't look like your plan has all of the funds you'd need to make this work (from a quick skim of what you listed).",

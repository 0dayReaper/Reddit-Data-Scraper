    "postText": "Hi y'all. This isn't my usual subreddit. Money was never talked about in my family, so I never learned how to navigate the systems we have, and I would consider myself financially illiterate for the most part. I would appreciate any better-informed thoughts/advice: I'm hesitant to pursue something like a loan without some input, but am in a situation that feels impossible and there's a possibility it could put me in a better position... or, you know, a worse one.\n\nBecause I know advice will differ depending on location, I'm in America, home of the endlessly-working-yet-still-in-poverty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, here's the conundrum with any info that seemed relevant to the whole situation. It's a little lengthy, sorry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm in my early 20's and have been struggling financially for the entirety of my adult life, due to a disability that prevents me from working more than one part time job. I live in a state with very poor (nearly nonexistent, and very unreliable) public transportation. The city where I work and currently live has slightly more public transit in the form of a few train lines, one of which goes directly to my job, which is what I currently use to get to and from work.\n\nI'm in an unbearable living situation right now. I moved into this apartment during a housing emergency, when I had only 2 weeks to pull together enough funds to move, pack, and find an apartment or I'd end up on the streets. I didn't have the time or the funds to be picky, beyond making sure that my belongings and my cat were relatively safe and housed. It was always intended to be temporary, and I feel the urge to leave more and more with each day. My roommates, not to go into too much detail, never clean. Ever. They spend the majority of their time at home doing drugs, making crazy messes in the kitchen, and watching tv. It is gross enough to interfere with my daily functioning, like eating, showering, simply moving around in common areas, etc.\n\nRent in the city is entirely unaffordable for a single person (and tbh I have been genuinely traumatized by several terrible roommate situations, and would really just like to be left alone in my own space). Moving out of the city is significantly cheaper, but requires a car since public transportation is so scarce and unreliable. Saving money in a city this expensive while working part time is pretty much impossible, especially when I frequently need to eat out because of how truly hazardous and unsanitary the kitchen is. I don't know how to properly emphasize how bad it is. So, there are 3 things keeping me from moving right now. Money for moving fees, money for deposits, and a car for transportation. Which could also be solved with a couple thousand dollars to get a used car on craigslist.\n\nI've been considering getting a personal loan to pay for a beater car, moving fees, and approx. 3 months of rent so I have time to put aside some savings while I begin paying the loan back. I feel like, if I only borrow as much as I need, with a low enough interest fee I could afford the monthly payments for the 5 years or so it would probably take to pay off. That all said, I know how dangerous loans can be, and I'm hesitant to go into this without the right knowledge. Is it a bad idea? How do I know that I'm getting a good interest rate so that I can pay the loan back in full and not be saddled with it forever? What else am I not considering that might factor into a loan and your ability to pay it back? Are there avenues I could take that someone with little to no knowledge of financial systems might not have considered? I desperately need help getting out of here, and all of my barriers are financial.\n\nThank you if you have actually read this far. Any advice from someone with more knowledge than me on this subject is greatly appreciated.\n\ntldr: I'm considering a personal loan to get out of a bad living situation, which would require a car as well as deposits and fees that I can't currently afford. Is it a bad idea? Is it possible to pay it all back?",

            "comment": "I hate to sound flippant, but the first question you should ask is \"can I even get a personal loan?\"\n\nFrom what I can tell, your income amounts to whatever you make at a single part time job. Do you have any credit history? Because, as it is, you would be highly, highly unlikely to qualify for any loan and I would be extremely wary of anyone who is willing to give a loan in these circumstances.",

I make a little over 2000 a month, in a busy cafe, but admittedly half of that is tips. They're consistently in the same range and pre-taxed on my check, but I'm not sure if they'd consider that part of my income in this context. I have been wary of talking to my bank about details without knowing if it's even a good idea, since if I'm not prepared it's too easy to pressure me into something. Truly in the most early stages of researching and have been overwhelmed with the information available.",

They don't care how much you make, they care how much you report. So not reporting income in tips will hurt you when it comes to lending money. \n\n1. reduce your living costs at maximum.\n2. increase your income as much as possible.\n\nThat's it.",

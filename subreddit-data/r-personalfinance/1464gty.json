You'd be financing 31.5 thousands. Your monthly payment would be \"31.5\" times \"$22.78\" which equals \"$875.07\" per month. \n\nIf you're thinking \"holy crap, that's a huge monthly payment!\" then yes, yes it is. That's what it takes to buy yourself a cheaper-than-average car, like a GR86 or a Miata with cloth seats or a Camry with four cylinders and no sunroof.",

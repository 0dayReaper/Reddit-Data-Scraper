    "postText": "Let me preface by saying I have a great reliable car, a handed-down 2015 Q70S with around 80k miles that I\u2019ve driven for about a year now. I can easily get another 80k out of it. Best part is there\u2019s no payment on it.\n\nHowever after working for a couple of years now and living at home I\u2019ve saved a ton between retirement and regular cash (put into HYSA, I-bonds, and T-bills). Even though my car is a blessing, I keep having the itch to get a newer one. How can I keep focus of my goal of saving for a down payment on a house? I live in SoCal, so HCOL. If I were to buy a car I would trade-in my current one, put down another 5-10k, and finance the rest.\n\nIf it\u2019s pertinent:\n\n* no debt\n\n* average ~100k gross since I\u2019ve been employed for 2 years.\n\n* credit score of 750+",

The fact that you posted this tells me you know it's not necessary and you including the details of your financial position tells me you're trying to validate the want. If your car is paid and has much life left, why would you even consider a new car if your actual goal is to save for a house? Don't let your wants get in the way of your goals.",

If you really want a car, start by setting aside a \"car payment\" in a separate savings account and simulate what the payment plus added insurance would be like for you. In 6 months if it's comfortable, and you still have that itch, get it, and you have a bigger down payment. Also it won't be an implied buy at that point. Just remember that money you save now is going to grow far more than money in 10 years you save. Take advantage of that and catch some FIRE so you can retire at 40 and laugh at us chumps while you sip tea on your porch as we slave away until age 65.",

If you drive seasonably amount, keeping it is still much cheaper. \n\nInfiniti is the brand that you get the most for what you pay for in terms of feature. I highly doubt that you can get a newer car with what Q70s has for under $45k. You will likely be downgrading.",

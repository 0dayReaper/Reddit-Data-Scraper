And it's like 75% because I want to pay my house off earlier... but also 25% wanting to make sure they can collect the least possible amount of interest on me....\n\nedit: You can stop insulting me. I understand I could be making 1.5% more interest per year (maybe, pre-tax) if I used a HYSA instead of putting extra into my house, but I don't care. I'd rather pay off my house, period. You can stop telling me how illogical and emotional I am, lol. I get it. I've always gotten it and made the choice on how to balance my investments and my house debt after talking with several experts. I invest twice the amount that I put into the house. I don't care about the potential 1.5% per year....",

But if they lose their job and can\u2019t find one for a year, the bank doesn\u2019t care at all that you\u2019ve been making extra payments, they still need that monthly mortgage payment. If the extra is in an hysa that can be used to make sure your children will not go unhoused. So the logic doesn\u2019t quite work out on that, it\u2019s actually quite a bit less safe for your family to make the extra payments. They\u2019d also be getting 5% on the hysa instead of paying off a 3.5% mortgage.",

If they fail to do so, or if they pay late, the servicer is responsible for the loss.\n\n\nContact your servicer and explain what happened. Have copies of the paperwork available. There should be an address for sending a \"Qualified Written Request\" on your mortgage statement or on their website; that's the best place to send a written complaint. They have 5 days to acknowledge receipt of the complaint and 30 days after receipt to resolve the complaint or let you know that they need a 15-day extension. If that doesn't help, as other people have mentioned, complain to the CFPB. Depending on your state, you may also have a state regulatory agency you can contact; New York, California, and West Virginia, in particular, will cheerfully hammer on a mortgage servicer. The state Attorney General office would be the place to start there.",

So if you have been paying your mortgage on time and in full, then you will be fine.\n\nLegally, the worst case scenario here is the tax assessor is going to charge a late fee to your loan servicer. Loan servicers/investors do not want fees/liens from the state, so they will pay that off.\n\nUnder no circumstances should they pass that late fee onto you if you've been paying your mortgage on time.\n\nTo ensure this gets escalated and resolved properly, you want to do the following:\n\nSubmit a qualified written request (QWR)/complaint with your servicer. Make sure to review your monthly statements to see if they have a specific address where you must submit QWRs and make sure to send it there. If sent correctly, the servicer is required by federal law to acknowledge your complaint within 5 days and respond in full within 30 days.\n\n\nIf you want to go all-out, make sure to file a complaint with the CFPB and your local state banking department to ensure the ball gets rolling on your issue.\n\n\n[The regulation](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1024/17/#k) if you want to have it in hand:\n\n\n12 CFR Part 1024.17(K)",

    "postText": "I file taxes as \"married filing jointly.\"  My spouse does not work.  For 2023 tax year, I understand I can contribute $7500 for both myself and my wife to a Roth IRA (MAGI is much lower than $218K).\n\nVia an investment firm (Fidelity, Schwab,  Vanguard, etc.) can I contribute $15K for the two of us to my own Roth IRA account for 2023, or does my spouse have to have a separate investment firm account, and there contribute her own $7500?\n\nBTW, I also have a company 401(k) Roth and my understanding is a person can contribute up to $30K in 2023, depending on age/catchup, via my company deductions to that Roth.  Hopefully, that is correct and doesn't affect my question above.\n\nThanks.",

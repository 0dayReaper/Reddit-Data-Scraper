    "postText": "Hi, I don\u2019t know everything about credit cards. How I\u2019ve used my only card is putting  daily expenses on it throughout the month and paying it off when I get paid at the end of the month. Between my paycheck and my husband\u2019s I have about $1900 left over for incidental expenses including groceries and emergency expenses and I typically run up the card about that much or a little less (we have a toddler and having a kid is expensive!). We also don\u2019t really have any savings (which is a topic for another post). \n\nAnyways, my grandma is not doing well and is expected to pass soon (within the next year) and this month is the only time I could visit with her. So between buying plane tickets for my daughter and I and a rental car, as well as some other expenses that have come up and tbh some frivolous spending, I am at that $1900 limit only 9 days into the month. My husband will get paid next week and that will help a little but I still have some other expenses I\u2019m expecting before that. \n\nI know this is my fault and I feel like an idiot for getting us into this situation, but what\u2019s the best course of action? I\u2019m planning on paying off $1900 when I get my paycheck but I\u2019ll probably have a couple hundred left. Will I owe interest on that? APR is 14.75%. payment due the 10th of the month. credit limit $2500 (I know it\u2019s bad to use that much credit but I don\u2019t know what else to do) and I could probably apply to have it raised. and we have money set aside for all of our set bills in cash, right now about $2250 and will total $3000 by next week with my husband\u2019s paycheck. \n\nI know this is kind of confusing so happy to answer any questions.",

Yes, you will be paying exorbitant interest.  But it will only be for a very short time, so not the end of the world, yes?  Seeing your dying grandma is a legitimate reason.  Pay off your balance as soon as you can.  Get it all the way to zero, or they will still keep charging interest.  And by zero, I mean everything you have charged, not just things that have actually shown up on a bill/statement.",

This isn't a killer, it has happened to many of us, but it means, at the very least, interest costs this month, and, even if you pay in full next month, there will be more interest.\n\nBottom line: pay as much as you can without jeopardizing your finances (don't miss rent or utilities, and obviously you need food, etc), and pay everything off next month (or the month after at the latest). Once you get ahead of this, build an emergency fund (even if you can only put $10/mo aside in another savings account, that is better than nothing!) so the next time an emergency comes up, you have a cash cushion.\n\nThis doesn't have to be a financial trap, if it takes a couple of months to dig yourself out, that is OK, but definitely start looking at the big picture and preparing better for the next emergency, OK?",

If you don't, it isn't an interest-free loan for anything\n\nYou can get ahead of this, most of us have been through something similar....an unexpected need for travel, a broken appliance that NEEDS to be replaced, whatever. Pay as much as you can this month (yeah, you'll still be charged interest, but believe me), then pay as much as you can next month (hopefully all of it!).\n\nYou can do this, and once it is behind you, build up a cash stash for the next emergency so you don't have to worry about it, 'k?",

So if the card works that way, it would be beneficial to pay down what you can with the husband\u2019s check earlier and then pay the remainder with OP\u2019s check later instead of waiting to make one lump payment. But check the terms of the card.",

            "comment": "Your root problem seems to be not realizing you were running out of money, ie spending on frivolous expenses when you were broke. Lawd have I been there. As you've realized, credit cards allow us to spend more money than we have. One way to avoid this is to make a budget. Budgeting will help you avoid accidental overspending and eventually plan for future expenses (aka save money).\n\nThere are lots of tools to help you budget. I personally use You Need A Budget which has a subscription fee, but you can get very similar functionality for free -- Mint is one example, and there are even free spreadsheets you can download. Search the subreddit, this comes up a lot. I would also read the wiki in the sidebar, as the whole thing is worth your time and there is a section on budgeting.\n\nAs far as advice for your current situation, you already know you need to pay the CC bill. Credit card debt is a financial emergency due to the interest rate, and your #1 priority needs to be paying the bill in full until the interest stops accruing. I would seriously consider not using credit until you have a better handle on your spending.\n\nGood luck, let me know if I can help.",

It is not life altering if you don't have the full balance to pay this month, you can get it next month.  So, you will get charged  $25 for interest on your next statement.  Just don't make a habit of it.  MOST important, do NOT be late as those fees are higher and being late affects your credit score.  The bank may automatically raise your limit without even asking, they do this periodically.\n\nI probably would have done the same thing, I miss my grandmother dearly.  Take plenty of pictures and videos and enjoy as much time as you have left with her!",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm back six months later with a new version of the budgeting spreadsheet I made. Earlier this year I posted the spreadsheet I made for myself and it really resonated with people. As I got more and more feedback I found places where I could improve and develop the sheet into something easier to use but still useful. \n\nYou can find pictures of it [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/63LxvUQ)\n\nA bit of background on me and why I made this- and also why it's made the way it is. I grew up poor and was never taught about HOW to handle money. If we had money it was already needed for other things. Food, Bills, all of the money we had already had a place. This made me get a mentality that if I had money I needed to spend it before something came up and the money would go. It's unhealthy, but it was the only thing I knew until I moved out. I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it, so I just USED it. Even now I still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if I'm not careful. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother problem I faced is that I have ADHD, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have made this sheet- and previous versions of it- with three goals in mind:\n\n* That it be easy to use\n* that I can focus on one daily number while supporting my long term goals\n* that it be a good starting place for people who have never had another budget\n\nThe sheet is divided into a few different tools.\n\nBudget:\n\n* Select your pay schedule, add any extra income/tips that you get monthly and select the percentage of that income that you want to save.\n* the credit card section allows you to input up to five cards and adds your monthly car payments to your expenses\n* The expenses area is where you'll add all of your itemized expenses. You can also select when your bill is due during the month- allowing you to see if early on in the month your spendable is different from later on in the month. \n\nYour budget summary at the top is the breakdown of all the information below. YES I know pie charts aren't useful for everything- but that is useful to visually digest information. Look and see where your money is going, see if you spend more than you earn, and finally- see how much money you can spend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis sheet focuses on giving you ONE number to remember. Daily Spendable. If you want to spend money throughout the day you just have to make sure you DONT go over that number and you will always have enough to cover any other expenses. \n\n I don't work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven't spent more than I'm allowed to- and if I do i can see where I'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.\n\nThere are a few extra features too- a large purchase calculator that lets you figure how long youd have to save to buy a larger purchase. It includes a monthly tracker that lets you see what youre spending realistically vs what you've budgeted for and finally a daily tracker for further breakdown. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally \n[LINK THREE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vekdgMTyWO9VSTyDN-8XVr4I-WGuDfpbiZd6-vrpf_Y/copy)\n\nChanges: Added a bi weekly option so you stop asking me to redo math, please yall, its an open spreadsheet you can edit it but i did this one for you.  Also NOTE: Yall i wont make an excel version. Some of the functions/graphs break, and the whole point of this is that i made it for myself and i want to share it freely, what means not a paid program- i'm sorry!",

I have a similar sheet, though not nearly as nice as yours for tracking expenses and seeing how spending varies from year to year.\n\nOne thing I find really useful when looking over my budgets and expenses is not only to compare my spending over time but also to compare my spending to spending of average households. One site I found that is useful for this was this website showing income and spending across different household categories: [US Household Spending Breakdown by Income Group](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/)\n\nI've always found that visualizing (i.e. \"seeing\") how your money goes to expenses is super useful.  It's much better than just looking at a bunch of numbers in a spreadsheet.",

After using YNAB for 5 months I've halfed my CC debit, and started a substantial (for me, probably not for other people) savings/emergency fund.\n\nThe only downfall is that it does cost money after the first month. I think it's like $85 for the year. But it saved me way more money than that in the month I used it so I think it's totally worth it.",

We'd just had a NICU baby and I thought we could afford to continue to live in our home and be OK despite the medical bills piling. We also went down to one income.  It was tight, but I thought we could make it. I was doing extra here and there for income and figured we'd just eat ramen all day.   \n\n\nI was able to list the bills out, but once I had used your original spreadsheet it actually added up in a way we could understand and make tangible to us. I'd made my own rudimentary spreadsheets before and it seemed like we'd be able to save money, but only barely, but when I downloaded yours we both realized we legitimately had to get out because even with extra jobs and whatever else, we were barely making it.   \n\n\nWe made a cross country move to live with my dad temporarily while we paid off the NICU bills. We continued paying rent with what little money we had, and now we put all that money towards debt. Because we moved -- that allowed my husband to find a job where he makes double what he made before/and more than our combined income. Soon we'll be debt free and be able to save for a house. We use your spreadsheet every single day. Your spreadsheet saved us from being so blinded by hope that we would've eventually been forced to live in a homeless shelter.    \n\n\nThank you so, so much for sharing this with us. Thank you, thank you, thank you. \u2665",

How do i have both a daily spendable of $37 and a weekly spendable $78?\nIf i spend 7 days in a row at 37 that is 259 way over the weekly spendable. Did i break something in this or is there a serious math error... or more likley am i just misunderstanding those numbers?",

It can happen for me while shopping normally too, but my main and most expensive impulse spending problems are with online spending.",

If it's 5 days I can still remember what I wanted odds are I really wanted it.",

This is not financial advice for your situation and you should do your own research before applying for any cards*\n\n## Best All Categories Cash Back\n\n### If spending &lt; $1,000 / mo.\n**Citi DoubleCash** 2% interest with no annual fee and no restrictions makes this my current catch-all card.\n\n### If spending &gt; $1,000 / mo.\n**Alliant CU Signature Visa** if you plan to spend more than $11,800 / yr on this card then 2.5% cash back more than covers the $59 annual fee, especially in the first year when all purchases receive 3% cash back.\n\n## Categories\n\n### You Choose\n\n**US Bank Cash+** Select 2 categories of your choice and receive 5% cash back up to $2,000 / qtr is just about the best I found anywhere.  Pretty much the only way I found to beat this is with a small army of cards dedicated to separate categories.\n\n### Dedicated\n**Costco** and **Amazon** Amazon nets 5% and Costco nets 4% back total on purchases with those retailers if you have a membership.  So if you already have a membership and frequently shop at Costco / Amazon both of those cards seem like pretty good deals as well.\n\n## Promos\n\n### By %\n**Chase Freedom Unlimited**, **US Bank Cash+**, &amp; **Bank of America Cash Rewards** all offer $150 when you spend $500 in the first 3 months which is an astounding 30% back!\n\n### By $\nDespite the annual fee **Capital One Savor** offers a $500 promo if you think you are going to spend more than $3,000 in the first 3 months.  Personally I am not a fan of the annual fee associated with this card, but if you are just about those promo offers, $500 is nothing to scoff at.\n\n# Summary\n\nSelfishly, I made this list for myself as I was deciding which cards to apply for.  I already have strong credit, but I wanted to find cards that I could keep open long term to build my credit as my lifestyle changes, so my #1 rule was \"No Annual Fees.\"  Without an annual fee there is no penalty to keeping the account open by purchasing a snickers once / qtr so my average account age can grow.  While there are a few cards with annual fees that have nice benefits, I personally didn't find that they wound up outweighing the chance that my lifestyle would change or a better card would come along and I would need to close the account.\n\n**Personally, I wound up applying for the Citi DoubleCash &amp; US Bank Cash+**.  If I find that I am spending more than $1,000 on the Citi DoubleCash I will probably apply for the Alliant Signature Visa since I will be over the breakeven point.  As for the US Bank Cash+, I really like this card because I can see keeping it open for quite a long time due to it's great rewards and flexibility to adapt to life changes.\n\n*Please let me know if I made any mistakes or if you have a better card that should be on this list!*\n\nEdit: \n\nI can't keep up with all the comments so I am just going to list suggestions here without all the details\n\n- Uber Visa -$0 fee - 4% Restaurants \\ 3% Travel \\ 2% Online purchases \\ 1% everything else\n- PayPal - $0 fee - 2.0% back \n- Alliant Platinum Rewards - $0 fee - 2% back\n- Capital One SavorOne - $0 fee - Dining &amp; Entertainment",

A lot of cards with $95 annual fees will waive the annual fee the first year, and you are able to product change the card to one of the cards listed in your table above for no fee. So you can get the large ~$500 sign up bonus, and downgrade/product change after 1 year.\n",

Can\u2019t tell you the details of that contract, but Citi is ultimately absorbing the costs in premiums or otherwise.\n\nIf you are wondering how Citi can afford it, most consumers don\u2019t have the patience to mess with it. Actually, probably most cardholders forget they have it, even if they read about it when first applying and thought it sounded cool.\n\nSo a tiny percentage of consumers get a few bucks back now and then, and they get to advertise about it.\n\nNow, normally that might actually end up being a money loser in the era of third party apps that people set up to automate the process, and a more savvy subset of consumers that will use it heavily. That\u2019s why most card issuers abolished their price protection programs last year, and why citi rolled back how generous its policy is (they cut the max limits on reimbursement to around 50% of what they were).\n\nBut my guess is citi keeps it around now that they are one of the few remaining card issuers who offer it, because that gives it even greater marketing value in attracting customers. They very well might lower the limits again though. And they might hamper third party automation when they think they can get away with it, and continue to pull from way less retailers than they could in their internal automated search. Basically they might try to reduce the value to the heavy users.\n\nSo that\u2019s how it works. The mom and pop store doesn\u2019t lose anything except for having paid higher interchange fees on the purchase initially. Cards with higher rewards charge the merchant a higher interchange fee, so a basic no rewards visa charges a smaller percentage of the purchase than say a high rewards visa signature. Citibank couldn\u2019t charge the merchant for the price difference even if it wanted to, it has no contractual right to that.\n\nEDIT: Sidepoint, but if you think about the interchange fee difference mentioned above, it\u2019s pretty horrible actually, because merchants raise prices to cover the higher interchange fees on the high rewards cards, but are forbidden by contract with the cc companies from charging different prices to the consumer with the basic credit card with the low interchange fee, meaning all the fancy awards we are chasing in this post are ultimately paid for by the people carrying low rewards cards or those paying with cash. You can probably guess at the net effect of this, here some numbers from a 2010 study:\n\n&gt; After accounting for rewards paid by banks, households who earn more than $150,000 annually receive a subsidy of $756 on average every year, while the households earning $20,000 or less pay $23. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSTRE66P50S20100726 (I do have one question on the study\u2019s methodology though, as I can\u2019t confirm if they adequately accounted for the benefits to a store of having to transport and process less cash, as well as the volume benefits of consumers purchasing more with cards than if they had cash, so they might be overestimating the relative burden of cash payers compared to low rewards/low interchange fee cards)",

You can then go to the Citi website and let them know the purchase information.  Let's say a month later the same TV is selling for $400 somewhere (if Citi didn't already catch it) you can send screenshots/ad scans to Citi and after review, they will credit you $100.\n",

I called Barclays and they said it was specifically cause I haven't had a credit card before.\n\nI'm 24 and didn't want a card in college. I just think it's funny that Barclays and uber came together, and it seems uber is more often used by younger people with little to no credit history. Just a weird combo IMO",

Use the 1.5 cent per point through CSR portal as it makes more sense usually, especially if you see a cash flight deal. For example, roundtrip economy from New York to Bagnkok can be had for $500 or less. That's 33.3k chase points. There's no airline in existence that you can redeem 33.3k miles at to fly roundtrip from NYC to Bangkok. Now that is a good redemption.   \n\n2. Want Business or First Class Flights? Go find award availability and transfer to an airline.    \nCase in point, it only takes 120k chase points to transfer to Virgin Atlantic to fly first class round trip from New York to Tokyo. That's an equivalent of $1800 in award portal money. It's highly unlikely that one can buy a first class roundtrip ticket to Japan for $1800. This is where transferring to miles makes more sense. ",

Online shopping is a category choice, which is pretty awesome in how broad it is. But kind of a hassle to worry about hitting that limit and reverting. \n\nAssuming non-obsessive but pure catagory use, sometimes going a couple hundred over the limit in category sometimes falling a couple hundred below, it might get you $250 a year additional cashback vs using Alliant\u2019s 2.5% card for those purchases (not including the Alliant $59 annual fee, because I\u2019d keep Alliant around anyway, the 0.5% spread between Alliant's 2.5% and the 2% cards like citi dc on annual utility bills for a house where I live alone covers around half the annual fee)\n\nThe 100k level of assets under management to qualify can be reached through retirement accounts, and apparently you can just transfer over your passive indexes and you don\u2019t have to pay management fees or anything. But while the $250 a year is probably worth the complexity of adding an additional credit card, I\u2019m not so sure it is really worth adding another bank and splitting up your retirement assets from vanguard or wherever. And the other banking benefits they give are completely useless (ie, BoA savings account interest rate increases from 0.03% to 0.06%, when you can get 40x that rate at other banks), or are terms you can get elsewhere automatically (no monthly account fees, atm reimbursement, etc). For example, Schwab investor checking gives better terms and great customer service without the need to qualify.\n",

This only applies to people who travel. \n\nThe best combination I have found is a Chase Sapphire Reserve + Freedom Unlimited + Freedom. \n\nThe effective annual fees for these cards is $150 ($300 travel credit from reserve countering the $450 fee). With these cards, I essentially get 4.5% on dining out and travel expenses, 2.25% on normal purchases, and 7.5% on monthly categories like grocery stores (where I load up on gift cards) and online purchases. This is all assuming I redeem points for travel, which I do. \n\nI also get free global entry and lounges for as long as I have the cards. For anyone that travels (I make 3-5 international trips a year) the lounges alone pay for the card, as airport meals and drinks are hella expensive. Couple this with incredible travel protection against everything from lost luggage to delayed flights and you have the best card on the market. ",

So once I hit it I'll get a $47.04 credit ($11.76 Netflix charge x4) and then once the next Netflix charge comes I'll get the other $2.96 credit.",

I have a Cash + as well and imo what\u2019s special about it is how unique the 5% categories are - I do internet/streaming services (Comcast/Spotify) and home utilities through Arcadia Power (which allows you to use a card with no credit card fee to pay for the clean energy equivalent of your bill). \n\nWhat\u2019s nice about the Discover It is that its quarterly categories never overlap with the Chase Freedom (e.g. Q1 is groceries for the Discover, Q2 is groceries for the Freedom) and you can usually \u201cmax out\u201d your category each quarter with gift cards, which can also remove the need for other more specific cards; for example, the Freedom usually has a warehouse quarter, so if you\u2019re liquid enough you can buy up Costco Cash at a 5% discount during that quarter to use until it\u2019s a bonus again.

            "comment": "Thanks for putting this together. I don't travel enough to take advantage of some of the better cards out there .... but there are a lot of good pure cash rewards cards. Always nice to see this organized together. Some things I noticed:\n\n- Bank of America's Cash Rewards Credit Card can be both Visa Signature (base card) &amp; Mastercard World (MLB, WWF etc...). Also, I think you shifted the columns on this one when entering the 75% bonus; the spending limit is in the promo, and the promo is in the spending column. And last, the 3% category can be changed from month to month basis if needed.\n\n- Discover IT: Discover matches your cash back for the first year (effectively 10% first year), which is capped ($75 cap per quarter, so $300 total); so they'd match up to $300. Also, I believe you can apply for up to 2 Discover It cards (either at same time or back to back for cashback match). \n\n- Chase's Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is only 5% if you have Amazon Prime active; it reverts back to the 3% card if you don't have Amazon Prime.\n\nP.S - BoA doesn't get much good rep here, but holy shit their cash rewards card + preferred rewards program (platinum honors is $100k+ in assets at BoA + Merrill) has some seriously good bonuses. The two main perks are 100 free etf/stock trades a month, and the 75% bonus to credit cards rewards.\n\n- I have two cash rewards cards with the 3% boosted to 5.25%; one for dining, and another for online purchases. Online purchases includes everything you buy online ..... including Amazon, Paypal, Buying Tickets online (some Flights, Sports, etc...). Capped at $2500 quarterly of course, but it's very useful. I might even get a 3rd card because another category is Drug Stores ..... i.e. just buy a bunch of gift cards and use whenever. Shit is bonkers. Oh and, I also get 3.5% on groceries and 1.75% on everything else.",

            "comment": "Yes, Citi DoubleCash rules, at least for now.\n\nAmazon is great if you spend lots of cash on Amazon, 5% is nothing to sneer at.\n\nDiscover can go and jump off the bridge for all I care. It was my very first card and after several good years all of a sudden three of my payments in a row were \"late\" (before internet banking, mailed checks) even though they were sent well in advance and the payments for another card that I had all posted a week early. They refused to cancel the late fees for the last two payments and I never even considered Discover again. Found out later that this was one of the common tricks they used to milk some extra cash from customers.",

Once you hit the max on groceries and gas go to Double Cash.  See below for exception.  Free Shop Runner membership has come in handy a few times.\n\nChase Freedom for quarter of 5% groceries and 5% gas.  Also about $50 of offers I use per year.  When they used to do Q4 5% \n\nMy grocery store gives $0.10 off per gallon for every $100 so that\u2019s gravy on top of the cash back.\n\nThese three cards used in the right pattern and you can land in the 3-4% range on all spend.  The first year I opened them I was up a over $1,000 in cash back not including sign up bonus.\n\nOn occasion you\u2019ll hit another 5% category with Chase.  ",

    "postText": "I'm 31 years old and barely scraping by. I am paid monthly and regularly run out of money before I'm paid each month. I make about $4,400/mo. after deductions/taxes ($78k/yr. pre-tax).\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, my roommate moved out and I became responsible for paying full rent myself (then $1,900 total). At the time, I had about $20k in credit card debt that had been with me for years and slowly growing. The first year of living alone, I admittedly did not budget appropriately to adjust for this big rent increase and my cc debt grew and grew. Last summer, I consolidated my debt with a personal loan of $40k ($850/mo. for a 5 year term). I had vowed to be very careful to not accrue new cc debt after doing this, but some unexpected dental expenses and a costly move to a new apartment (rent now $2k/mo) have led me to rack up $15k in new cc debt in the past 9 months.\n\nWhat I'm paid each month disappears quickly, with my biggest expenses being my $2k rent, $850 loan payment, and now around $500 in cc minimum payments. The refinancing of my cc debt into a loan last year has allowed me to pay down that debt over the year and has given me a lower overall interest rate, however because it's such a large payment each month, I have become more reliant on credit cards for everyday expenses, hence repeating the cycle.\n\nI am feeling increasingly desperate and am unsure of what my options are at this point.",

They're just a payment method - PAY being operative here.  You still have to pay for it.  If you aren't making enough money to pay for it, you shouldn't be buying it.  Stop ALL discretionary - if it isn't required to keep you fed (at home...no eating/ordering out), housed, and getting work, you can't have it right now.\n\nRealistically, you need a roommate.  It doesn't matter if you \"don't have time\" because you don't have money.  You either find/make the time to find a roommate or you find/make the time to get a second job.  You have to tip the scales on the money-in vs money-out equation you've got going right now.\n\nEdit: fixed the quote block",

Trust me, I know the feeling of just scraping by and feeling weighted by debt. It sucks to not be able to do anything, when what you want to do isn't even that much. And to do that for years...ugh.\n\nAt the same time, it's empowering to live minimally, and what you learn in the process can carry over to when you're out of debt, which feels great. I'm still very poor, but I don't feel much sacrifice day to day, because I value simple living and have based my lifestyle around that. Still incredibly angry about our country's state of affairs, though, and would be doing amazing if pay would rise and costs wouldn't skyrocket and if everything wasn't rigged to keep poor people poor.\n\nI'd try calling your credit card company and asking what your options are. They should have a hardship program that may reduce payments or interest, even to zero, for a time. There's also the unpopular option of defaulting altogether. I did that once and then eventually settled with collections to pay less. But if you're concerned about your credit, talk to them first. Don't feel ashamed or guilty. \n\nPoverty Finance might be a good sub to check out for more support.",

Can I find a way to up my money by renting out the spare room or dog walking. Do I need the car? Yes? Okay, sell it anyway, and get a beater. Do I use public transportation? Well, walk or get a bike instead. (Brainstorm and think of everything. It's just a season, not the rest of your life. You can buy a nice car again once you are out of the debt.)\n\nI'd also get an emergency fund so that things like dental expenses are set backs again. I know it seems weird to save when you have debt, so I'd start with the tried-and-true $1000, but then later, once the debt is clear (or manageable) I'd make sure to work it up to 3-6 month's worth. I would not touch it unless it is an actually emergency (and I'd be strict with that definition). (Trust me, if you don't have this fund, you will rely on credit cards in emergencies. That is the problem that saving this money avoids.)\n\nI'd cut up the credit cards. They are not my friends. At least, not until I have financial control. Probably never. Credit cards benefit banks. I am not a bank. Therefore they do not benefit me.\n\nThen, I'd budget strictly. Strictly. With no cuts, there is:\n\nPay: $4400Rent: $2000 -- $2400  \nLoan: $850 -- $1550  \nCredit Card Minimums: $500 -- $1050  \nUtilities: $ 250 (estimated)  \nPhone: $50 (cheap phone and a cheaper provider) -- $750  \nGroceries: $300 -- $450  \nHousehold Items: $100 -- $350  \nGas and Liability Insurance OR Transportation Pass: $100 -- $250  \nEating Out and Shopping: $20 (That's a weekly or every other week trip to Taco Bell or McDonalds, which are basically the cheapest places to eat if I go off the $1 or $2 value menus. Have fun!) -- $230  \nMisc. Money and Bank Account Buffer: $30 -- $200  \nAdditional Credit Card and Loan Payments: $200 -- $0\n\nThis is my life until the debt is paid off.\n\nWithout a car or transportation pass, I could pay off some debt with the money from the potential car sale, or at least get a bike and save the gas and insurance money. That's $100 savings right there.\n\nWith a side hustle, I could probably add $1000 easily to my debt payments.\n\nWith a roommate, I'd add $2200 plus $125 in utilities to my debt payments.\n\nWith all three, I'd have about $3425 extra a month to pay off debt. I'd pay off the loan exponentially faster--thus preserving my sanity (and love of Fiesta Veggie Burritos) a bit.",

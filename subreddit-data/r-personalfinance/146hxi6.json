When I tried to initiate a transfer recently, I got the message: \n\n\"Please choose the non-US country that issued the ID you have on hand\"   \nand a drop down with a list of countries (the US is not an option). \n\nI do not understand what this means, is transferwise not available to people who live in the US anymore?",

    "postText": "I am a pretty financial responsible person and have done a good job saving for a rainy day and retirement. I\u2019m pretty disciplined financially and tend not to spend money on things, or things I know i won\u2019t really want in a few months. I don\u2019t deny myself something and if I really want it and know I\u2019ll use it, or it will truly make me happy, I\u2019ll buy it, but I\u2019m not an overspender if stuff. I tend to spend discretionary money on travel and experiences solo or with friends or family instead. Love traveling and seeing new things, experiencing new things, join family on things that would give us quality time, etc. \n\nSo the flip side, I know sometimes I\u2019m too disciplined and balk at how much things costs\u2026 sometimes I know , unnecessarily. For instance, I was considering going on vacation this summer and flights are crazy expensive. And partly because of that, and partly because I waited too long to firm up my schedule, prices are even more ridiculous. Airfare is about double what I would have paid pre-pandemic. Could I afford it, yes. But it\u2019s the principle.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten better over the years, but how do you trick your mind to tell it, it\u2019s okay. I know I\u2019ll cry all the way to the bank because it seems unnecessary to cost that much, but in the grand scheme of things, will I really miss that extra money in a year. I know the answer is no, but I still play this game in my head. And need to figure how to get out of my own head. \n\nCurious as to those who struggle with the same thing, how you get over it.",

So many things are more expensive post-pandemic and while prices are cooling off a bit they're not going to go back to where they used to be.",

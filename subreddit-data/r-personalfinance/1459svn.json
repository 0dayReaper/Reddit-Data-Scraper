    "postText": "Just got married and now we need help with our credit card set up. My wife has Chase Sapphire and I have the Chase Freedom Unlimited and IHG Premier World Elite cards. We want to have a joint credit card for shared expenses and at least one credit card for our own expenses. \n\nMy thought is to become an AU for the Sapphire, so that the Sapphire becomes our joint card, and my wife opens up a new credit card, likely one without a yearly fee, for her own expenses. I would keep my Chase Freedom and IHG cards. \n\nAppreciate any feedback on this plan.",

Closing cards will hurt your credit of course, and you could open a new one together as an alternative too. My wife and I got rid of some of her cards, some of mine, and became AU on the ones we wanted to keep. I\u2019m sure this hurt our credit a little temporarily, but it didn\u2019t make sense to keep more cards than we needed. \n\nI get the impression that you and your wife will be dividing the expenses and/or use separate account. I\u2019m  not a marriage expert, but having only been married once and for 18 years I think this is a bad plan. If you\u2019re not combining your lives financially you\u2019ll always have a mine vs. hers vs. ours mentality. Best of luck!",

    "postText": "Hello  \nI am under investigation for an insurance company after my car was totaled for the 3rd time. They have made mention to me that deemed my car as a total loss sent out the paper work in order for me to state it was a total loss, sent money out to my loan company. As everything was getting paid out and handled and I signed over documents. They elected to tell me that they are stopping payment and putting me under investigation. I'm sure this isn't right. I did not steal my cars I pay my car note on time and I pay my deductible every time, as well as making sure they get their payment monthly. I have not missed a beat and now they are trying to not pay for it. I'm pretty sure I have a stalker. I walked out of my house to get something out of my car walked back inside for 30 minutes came back out and it was gone. Now i have to uproot my life and everything. Any advice. I do need to speak with a lawyer as well in California. Anyone know any good lawyers that might take the case... If I have one. ",

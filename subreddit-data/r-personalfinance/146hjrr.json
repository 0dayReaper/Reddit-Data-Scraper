    "title": "Should we increase 401k/IRA past 5% or keep paying extra on mortgage for now?",

    "postText": "My husband and I (23m and 22f) currently put 5% into our 401k with a 100% match up to 5%.\n\nI was going to increase our contributions to 15% or at least 10% as I\u2019ve seen a lot of advice to that from like Dave Ramsey and the Money Guy. My husband says 401ks are doing poorly, and wants us to keep putting the money into our first house (got it 3 months ago) because it has a 6% IR at 15 years and we want to pay it off early. We\u2019ve been trying to double our mortgage each month, bc it is about 40% of our take home, so we put in 80% of our take home and live off 20%. At our rate we could pay off the house by the time we\u2019re 30 and then put all the extra money into maxing out 401k/IRA. \n\nIf we increased 401k, that money would luckily get a 5-8% return from what I understand, but the house is a guaranteed 6% saving, so seems like a safer investment. Is there something we\u2019re not seeing as to why we should put more in 401k/Roth IRA?",

Does his comment mean that he thinks the last couple of years have been rough in the market? If so, is his opinion only to buy in when asset prices have recovered for a sustained period of time? That\u2019s a great way to make sure you experience minimal gains on your investments.\n\nAlso, 401ks don\u2019t \u201cdo poorly.\u201d They\u2019re a type of account that holds assets, of which there are many varieties. The assets are what perform better or worse, and any one person\u2019s experience will vary depending on their asset distribution.",

So he doesn\u2019t want to add more past the match.\n\nBut, what you\u2019re saying is my return will be different than his. So what we need to do is see if he can change what his 401k is investing in. Maybe we can talk about increasing to 10% something in the middle. We will definitely look at this more tysm",

At about the 10 year mark when the house is paid off, growth rate is now the same on both investments and you only have 5 years to catch up before you assume same annual investment in both. \n\nInvesting the money is the way to go.

If you make some assumptions and run the numbers, if they double the mortgage and pay it off in 6 yrs and then invest all of that money for the next 9, they will come out ahead at the 15 yr mark. But if they can only increase the mortgage by 50%, it then takes them 8 1/2 yrs to pay off the mortgage. At that point, they can\u2019t catch up to the investment by the 15 yr mark.",

If you pay toward the loan, there is a point where the 6% goes away and now you have extra money to invest toward the assumed 5%. It all depends on where in the 15 yr period that happens. If you\u2019re paying enough extra that it cuts the loan payments by half or more, you are probably better off. But if it cuts the loan payments by less than half, you don\u2019t have a long enough period of extra investments in the later portion of the 15 yr period to catch up to the compound earnings if you had been investing the whole time. \n\nThere are also other factors such as the 5% assumed earnings are conservative if you are young and invest aggressively. I\u2019ve had 30-40% years early on because I was aggressive and knew I wouldn\u2019t be withdrawing for 30 years. I\u2019ve also seen people pay down their mortgage aggressively only to decide they can afford more house and end up with a new mortgage and no savings.",

What if you moved to 8% and still put a ton on the house?  Reduces your taxable gross. And most people don't have enough other deductions to not just take the standard deduction. So while interest can be written off. Can you have more deductions than the standard deduction? The answer for most people is no. But reducing taxable gross with 401k. Yep that works. I think a Roth Ira contribution is something to think about too",

We we weren't planning to move soon, I think it would make more sense to balance out your investments. There certainly is a place for 6% guaranteed return, but you also want some in stocks.

Mortgage interest is tax-deductible, and houses are generally mediocre in the long term. If you're currently putting in 5% to your 401k, you could easily put in 15% and still pay extra on the mortgage - just not double.",

            "comment": "If your mortgage is 40% of your take home and you are already set up to pay it off in 15 years, I\u2019d focus first on making sure I had enough liquidity/emergency funding first. When the crumb crunchers arrive, one of you may want to cut back at work and having savings and investments outside of your retirement accounts would help. You are also vulnerable to a job loss with that kind of mortgage payment. It sounds like you control your spending very well which is a huge plus no matter what you decide. Major props for being this thoughtful and forward looking about your finances at this point in your life. It\u2019s also nice to see a husband/wife team approach. That will also pay off big time.",

Assuming you\u2019re contributing to traditional 401k you\u2019ll save money on taxes since contributions are deducted.

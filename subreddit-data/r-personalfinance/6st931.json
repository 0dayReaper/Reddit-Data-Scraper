Husband did not want me too, nor his brother, our oldest son. BIG SURPRISE. A week ago this 23 year old kid handed me a GOOD check for 14,800$. It paid off all the credit card debt I had gone into to help him and way more. I would do it again tmrw. I like being able tohelp him. His older brother had not asked for help in 10 years. I truly never expected to see this money &amp; I would be fine without it but can I just say WOW for my kid????",

She took the whole loan and got a 3.4% rate. Basically enabled me to take the first job and start my career.\n\nIn 2014 fico score was mid 700's.

Bought a house without a co-signer. #feelsgreatman\n\nThis subreddit often has posts where parents fuck over their kids. A thread talking about lending family money seemed like a great place to share how my mom did the exact opposite.\n\nI mean, ideally all parents would help their kids as much as their able, but she worked 72 hour weeks, three weeks a month, for three years, and I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am now without that.",

Many people (including many giving advice on this subreddit) go the far extreme \"save everything\" mentality and forget that your late teens and early 20s are where you primarily develop your personality. If you slave away you miss out experiencing life during your prime health/energy/low responsibility years. Not to mention those are prime years for building social skills. It's SO much harder to do things like trips with friends past those years when people settle down and have families.\n\nMemories you make at age 20 are remembered for potentially 60+ years. You can do well financially without putting them on hold.",

Also, do the math: Your $8-10 an hour pay is literally not worth your time. Hopefully, by the time you're 60, your hourly wage is around $40-70 an hour ($80-140k salary) and that will make up for all those days of working as a teen and missing out on life. Honestly, yes, work and make money but don't kill yourself. Don't find a balance.. find an imbalance that lets you work a little but live your young years out FULLY. Not working during your young years (work, internship, etc.) is boring but working all the time is draining. Find a good balance where your part time job helps fund some of your young years (going out, buying a nice shirt, books, going out on dates, etc.) b/c the money you make at $10 an hour is nothing compared to later on. \n\nI was lucky enough to get out of the working runt and cut my hours to 30 per week since i was 15 through hs and college (i know, I was sooo lazy lol). Now, I'm almost 27 and make in ONE HOUR what I made in a full day of work before. That $200-400 every 2 weeks means nothing compared to the THOU$ANDS I make every 2 weeks now. Work hard but for God's sake live more. Money isn't everything...a small money is nothing to kill yourself over. ",

But I've worked since 13 and have always worked and spent on myself until I got to college and had to save all my summer money for the school year so I could pay my bills. I didn't get an internship this summer so I went back to my old job and I was miserable because I wanted to get experience in my field so bad. I was depressed and angry and one night I said \"I deserve a vacation, I'm fucking 21 years old.\" And he was so appalled that I would say that at 21 years old. One summer I worked 3 separate jobs to save for school and it was fucking miserable. \n\nI'm rambling but the point is have a good fucking time OP, you don't want to be miserable at such a young age, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to enjoy yourself while you're still young.

This option is significantly cheaper than buying a plane and paying for all of your own maintenance/storage but it is still a costly hobby. ",

If you fly often, and fly with your family, and can fly a 4-seater, it could actually end up cheaper to be a private pilot than to pay airfare for your entire family over the year.\n\nIf you are just tooling around by yourself and don't do much domestic travel, ( or get your international pilot's license ), it's a very expensive hobby.\n\nRe: \"wet\" rate, it depends on the club. The one I was looking at charged for engine/fuel time by the \"tach hour\" (no membership fee), or $100 for each hour the plane was actually running. This includes fuel. So if you took your family to Boston and back from Portland, ME, ( about 6 hours round trip ), that would be $600. A round trip flight ( just looking ), is $299 on a major airline. So you would be looking at a trip for about half the cost.",

I don't respect my father or grandfather for their respective bank balances but for the things they did and stories they have to tell. Good luck to you. ",

This phrase always irks me too since i always get the feeling that the person saying it thinks that the only thing worth spending money on is world travel.... but personally I take the phrase to mean avoid 1) conspicuous consumption and 2) deadweight loss.   \n\nConspicuous consumption being a new car just to have a new car (even though a used car for a lot less will be just as comfortable/reliable/etc) or a $1000 watch when a $200 watch will look sharp and tell time exactly the same.   \n  \n  \nDeadweight loss is where people really trip up though, this basically means *dont fill your basement with shit you dont use*.  Be careful when buying things that you are making it a part of your life and not just buying it for the thrill of buying something (like a $1000 drone you use for a month and then get tired of).",

Research jobs, and find a field you might be interested in. Start working towards that, and college will be worth your time and money.\n\nYou hear a lot of complaints about student loans and under employment, but $30,000 will get you a long way at a state college. College opens an awful lot of doors; you just have to take advantage of them.\n\nUltimately it's up to you, and depends on what you want to do with your life.

I've been a tutor for 5 years throughout school and studied with lots of peers from all sorts of backgrounds. For me, school always came easy. I often skipped class, did part of the homework, and excelled on the tests. That's just to give you frame of reference for this comment.\n\nSomeone I went to school with struggled in school. He worked his butt off studying easily 5X as much as most anyone else in the class for every class. Nothing came easy to him and he often needed help to get through it. He still got his engineering degree, had an offer straight out of college, and makes more than me. He might not be a natural scholar, but he was an amazing student.\n\nSomeone else I went to school with worked full time, went to school 18 credit hours per semester, and looked like he never slept. He actually fell asleep at the wheel on multiple occasions due to his life problems, but got his degree with a higher GPA than me. He got his dream job out of college making about the same as the guy above. He was a great student who just had life stacked against him.\n\nGiven the above, I believe anyone can go to school for even a difficult degree if they are determined and not afraid of hard work. With that said, it isn't for everyone straight out of school or ever.\n\nI had plenty of students who were straight from high school, others took some time off for life troubles, and others were trying college for the 2nd or 3rd time. Often, the second and third category were better students. I think a part of it might be brain development. Another part was just maturity. They already got the \"freedom\" stage out of the way. Another part is that they are more likely to pay for their own schooling.\n\nFinally, a good friend of mine tried going to college multiple times. He came from a pretty wealthy family and was set \"on track\" for college from an early age. He struggled with school a bit, but had good grades in high school. He also believed he wasn't a great student. It took him multiple tries to decide college wasn't for him. He joined the military and never looked back.\n\nI know that's alot of anecdotes, but I think they all lead to a similar conclusion. When you say \"I'm good/bad at school\", you are right. It's a self-fulfilling thing for most people. If you go in confident and determined, you'll come out fine. If you go in doubtful and half-hearted, it probably won't go so well. Just decide whether you want to be a great student or not and how badly you want it. In almost all cases, you'll be right.",

They, after all, know your situation and life goals better than Reddit...are you planning to attend college or further education? Are your parents financially secure and are you going to be gifted (helped) a down payment on a house or business when you are ready? 30k for a child from a family of means is different to a child of a poor family with no resources. (I work at a company that is an umbrella of lots of small companies started by all the children. If one of them blew through 30k they would still go to college, buy a house, and get a business. Where as I would be devistated, hungry and homeless.)\n\nHonestly, If this was me and I was 18 starting over and could chart my course I would take 10k and try to backpack some place exciting for as long as possible. Travel is one of the best personal growth and educational experience in my opinion. However, there are lots of disclaimers around this. It isn't for everyone and if you aren't going some place that excites you it can be a waste of time and money. Sometimes you are able to work at hostiles in exchange for free board. I did this in Australia. There are also dive instructor apprenticeships where you work with dive tours for training and room and board. I'm not sure how legal these are but I did it as well. If I was your age with your resources I would do a gap year in Italy and Greece. \n\nI always thought if I traveled I needed good accommodation, it turns out I just need a safe place to sleep for a few hours and be on my way (I was in Australia at 38). I am completely OK with this! I've learned far greater things about myself when I was alone and poor than I ever did when I had money, or before that when I was pretending like I had money. \n\nThe other thing I would do at your age knowing what I know now is to get an associate degree locked down with lots of credits that improve my written and oral communication as well as math and science concepts (Calculus 3, Physics, Chemistry). I would do this through a local community college if possible, cheap as possible. But I would put as much into as possible. Being able to understand complex systems and being able to communicate that clearly is a life skill that is universally needed in almost every daily interaction whether you are working as a sales associate for Best Buy or are as a neurosurgeon. The reason to lock the credits down with an actual degree is that later if you decide you need a four-year degree the 60 credits role over and don't expire.\n\nUltimately you know you best but 30k doesn't last long when you have to pay all your own bills. However, it is more than most people will ever have in savings if we are talking world population. I wish you a great adventure whether you stay home or travel around the world. Keep us updated. Good Luck!\n\nPS: Please do not tell people you have 30k in savings. \n",

You can take a year off school and just work, you can work and go to community college, you can start working now to obtain mobile skills and you could travel and do a bit of freelance work so you can have some unique experiences without significantly depleting your funds, you can go to a trade school or find an apprenticeship, you can set up a Roth IRA if you'd like to get a head start on saving for retirement with major tax incentives based on your position. There are plenty of options, at this point in your life it really just depends what you're trying to get out of life. Invest in yourself early but not frivolously.  \n\nThat's a great deal of money to have saved at this point in your life, I'd encourage you not to spend it all on a four year education for a liberal arts degree. Mostly this is a point in your life when you can most afford to take risks and you have least perspective on who you are, who you want to be or what you're capable of. Use this money to enable the search for those answers but make pragmatic choices that don't deplete this fund. Congrats on the good early financial decisions. \n\n",

During my first semester of college I had two scholarships from my high school that allowed me to pay the tuition. So I didn't file for financial aid. But it turns out that I qualified for grants that covered the tuition. Fortunately, I was able to get that money during a summer semester. But if I would not have taken summer classes, I would have been out that money.\n\nSo still file for financial aid to see if you qualify for any grants. Also look at the interest rates on any student loans you might be able to take out. If you qualify for subsidized loans, then my understanding is that the government would pay your interest while you were in school. Or at least part of it. So it might work out to your benefit to invest the money that you would have spent on tuition that is otherwise covered by subsidized loans until you graduate, and then to just take that money and pay off the loans immediately.\n\nBut I'm not an expert, so take everything I just said with a massive grain of salt.",

As far as anyone else knows, you have what you need you are not the communal bail out account. You have sweet delicious money. Don't tell your dates, don't tell your friend's, don't tell extended family. People will have problems, and coming to the RICH friend is so much easier then trying to figure it out another way, especially if \"rich friend\" is a cool dude.\n\nand don't blow it all, don't use it to impress others. always have a rainy day fund. YOU know how much life energy you expended to accumulate this money. Money is coined liberty, play your cards right and you'll have a great life ahead of you. You mastered the skill of delayed gratification before the age of 20, don't let others take advantage of your sacrifices. ",

You just have to decide how important each of those things are in relation to the peace of mind of having $ in the bank. \n\nPersonally, I buy enough things to be comfortable and proud; enough health to be proactive; and the rest is split into memories and security/savings.

Then think about it again. \n\nReason being is most people are graduating now with a degree they do not really care about and from a school their parents told them to attend. \n\nGo see what you really want to be doing 10 years down the line, then afterward see what you need to do in order to get there. Chances are it is either a different major or a college you were not considering. \n\nAfter you do it, apply for the weird scholarships and see if you can go for less. The one major thing I wish I did is do not get cocky. I was spending more than I made in college and look back on myself now like a fool. Live below your means and continue to save. ",

You can contribute up to $5500 per year, and because it's \"already been taxed\" (in your case I see you may have some taxes to take care of, but generally speaking), when you get the money when you retire, you don't have to pay tax on it, even though it will have grown, and essentially be \"new\" income. \n\nStarting a Roth at your age is incredible; because of how math works, contributing from age 18-23 could theoretically have you set, whereas if you don't start til you are 30, it's much harder to play catch up, and you'll have to contribute the max essentially until you are eligible to withdraw the funds.

You have your entire rest of your life left to figure out where to invest and make more money. GO TRAVEL. Go on an adventure that you will remember for the rest of your life. Study a year abroad in college. These are the memories and events that will pay more dividends than any investment you could possibly make. The interactions you have with people, the knowledge you gain, and the friends you make are all way more important than remembering that time you saved an extra 10k. ",

Total nightmare to say the least.",

If so call the insurance company back and give them the check number and amount as they most likely applied it to the wrong policy.\n\nIf the check hasn't been cashed ask the mortgage company to put a stop pay on it and to resend a new check (with a tracking number). Most likely it got lost in the mail. They may have to double dip into your escrow temporarily until it's been 90 days since the first check was cut when and can put it back into your escrow account.\n\nYour insurance probably has a grace period in which it'll be reinstated when payment is received.\n\nLMK if you have questions.

When the insurance company tries to find the check in their system they'll ask for a check number, amount and date it was cashed. They almost never ask for a image of the check (sometimes they do but in my experience it's rare). It doesn't hurt to have a check image it's just not a must have if the servicer is dragging their feet.",

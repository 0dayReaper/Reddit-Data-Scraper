I guessed on every question and I am not expecting a score that will earn me a scholarship. The question is if there is a better investment for my $50k, other than a graduate education? I need to do some soul searching to figure out if I just give it all away to an institution, or use it to better myself in another way.",

                    "comment": "I currently work as a paralegal, and I 100% agree. When I started, I was pretty set on law school and was just giving myself a break before heading back. \n\nRight when I started working at a big law firm, I noticed the crazy hours these attorneys work. An attorney I worked for did not go home for 3 days one time because he just could not stop working as it was trial prep. \n\nThe current firm I work for required an average of 9 billable hours for new associates - which obviously doesn't count break times. That means Attorneys stay at work for 10 hours or more during the weekday. When you take time off, you need to make up the billable hours lost by working even later or on weekends. It is tough for them.\n\nOnce I saw all this, I'm perfectly happy as a paralegal - I get to do almost all of what a lawyer does without the accountability of being one, I go home at 4:30-5, and I get paid overtime for when I do stay late. \n\nYou need to be dedicated to make it as a lawyer, and willing to work those long hours. You will not survive in this field otherwise.\n\nEdit: I should note that I am working in biglaw litigation - smaller firms, solo practitioners, in-house, etc. are VERY different than my experience, as other people have noted. I'm simply describing what I went through. ",

When I actually go to trials, I have worked 70 hour weeks before. Keep in mind I am hourly so I made almost twice my normal paycheck during trial. \n\nOther areas can be very relaxed - I don't know for sure, but I believe corporate paralegals make very good money here in the bay area and it isn't as unpredictable as commerical litigation. \n\nWhile it is true you do not need prior experience, it is very difficult (near impossible imo) to get a job as a paralegal without something behind you. I worked as a case clerk and went through a 2 year ABA approved paralegal course after my BA, and from there I got hired as a paralegal. Most law firms require a BA with experience, a paralegal certificate, or both. My old firm wouldn't hire a paralegal if they didn't have a bachelors at minimum. ",

Most paralegals I believe start off as legal assistants and then become paralegals.  I worked as a legal assistant for years, and had a paralegal certificate.  It didn't make me a \"paralegal\".  That title was reserved for people who did a particular kind of work.  It was a smaller scope than what I did as an assistant, but it had more accountability.\n\nWhat it pays depends on the firm and the field.  In my experience, there were legal assistants who made more than the paralegals.  These assistants made up the back bone of the firm, and the attorneys would not be able to operate without them.  \n\nIn a major city, I'd guess the starting salary for a paralegal would be 50k.  If you had a few years of experience as a paralegal under your belt, you were good at your job, and the attorneys liked you, you could easily make 80k.",

To most people that would suck, but if you already love the work- what even more made it worth it is the attorneys I was working under didn\u2019t make overtime for working that much. That was the biggest paycheck I\u2019ve ever received. \n\nAlso, the ability to work on a case without having your actual license/name/reputation on the line is a beautiful, relaxing thing. \n\nOn the other hand I also took the LSAT, it\u2019s a stressful test and a ton of people re-take it. Maybe look into classes, there are options outside of Kaplan that are more reasonable, in addition to free websites Kaplan has paired with, power scores cheaper etc. if you really want to be an attorney don\u2019t let this one test get you down, you can do it again and win. \n\nYou are completely in control of your ability to score on the LSAT. So you just need to decide if you want to keep going, maybe push admissions back a year even and work as a legal assistant (looks great on your application). Or if you want to do something else. \n\nWishing you the best of luck on either path you choose. ",

Legal work for lawyers, aside from all of the other career potential for those with a law degree, varies so widely that any one perspective sheds almost no light.\n\nSure, big law does suck, particularly on new associates.  I don't think that's particularly different from any other gunner factory in any industry (like finance).  However, there are many other pathways to take with a law degree, and for example, my group of friends that remain close a decade and a half after LS, the careers are so varied.  Only 1 remains in big law, though 4 of us spent some time there.  One is a director of a colleges art exhibition programs.  Another works in fashion in a semi legal aspect, and in another for major film production company.  Most are now either at their own firm or a small to midsize. Personally, I did my second summer in big law and realized it wasn't for me. Then did a year in a mid-size, and it wasn't bad, but ultimately ended up at a very small, very specialized shop.  At this point, I work as I like, and make a  pretty solid living.  It really just depends on what your priorities are, and I've never been a live to work guy.  Instead, I coach all my kids' sports teams, and am still very active, and take 2 months of vacation every year.  I make less than a lot of other lawyers for that reason.  I've never billed 2k in a year.  I enjoy it and created my own fit, and now control my own destiny and firm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegardless, it is not the title, or the degree, or the industry that determines your quality of life and the hours expected - it's the place you choose to work.  Every single industry has people who want to work others to the bone, and those that are the opposite.  Don't focus on such things for decision making.  Instead focus on whether you like the work - for most legal work - the work itself is constant reading and writing and formulating logical comparisons.  It's generally not a thrill seeking gig.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost importantly, if you are not passionate about a doctoral level degree - do not get it.  It is unlikely that you will end up happy or fulfilled.  Find something your passionate about.   $50k for a young person could be the start of a small business. It could be the freedom to go work in your dream gig by taking a lower paying try it out gig, or externship.  Explore your options and yourself, and don't hurry to law school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdits: grammar, clarity.",

                                    "comment": "There are some great resources out there about law school admissions, so definitely do your research, but legal hiring (especially the jobs with the $$$$ salaries) give a huge premium to a prestigious degree. \n\nAlso, while law school admissions are down, legal hiring (and especially growth/promotions) is really in flux right now. I'm a lawyer, I love what I do, but it's an industry in transition. Bottom line is it's easier to get into a good school now but the bottom drops out more quickly for those who don't make it. \n\nAll of that to say, go to the best law school you can get into, with very few exceptions. \n\n1) Law school prestige is broken into tiers, and the top tier is made up of the top 14 law schools who haven't really changed in decades (they trade places but don't really fall out of that range): Yale, Harvard, Stanford, U Chicago, Columbia, NYU, UPenn, University of Michigan, University of Virginia, Berkeley, Duke, Northwestern, Cornell, and Georgetown. Schools that are within a few points of each other on this list are pretty interchangeable re: jobs, but they're all very good with good recruiting. That said, Yale is *always* #1 with a bullet and more geared towards future academics. Georgetown, Cornell, Northwestern are definitely looked down upon a touch by those higher up and are less likely to get the most prestigious clerkships and fellowships. I went to the #9 school my year despite being accepted at #3 because #9 gave me a full ride. I don't regret that for a second. I wouldn't make the same choice for #17 over #14. Size of school, culture, location, ideology, etc. are also things that are reasonable to consider when comparing schools in this range. T14 schools are averaging between a 173 and 167 for LSAT and between 3.93 and 3.76 for GPA. Keep in mind if you want a scholarship, you'd want to beat those averages. \n\n2) if you're goal is not to get all the best clerkships and enter biglaw (large firms in major markets that pay close to $200k right out of school with upper-five-figure bonuses) and instead you want to work somewhere smaller (and expect to earn more like $70-80k/year), then you still need to go to a good school, but you can drop down a few levels if you stay local. For example, Emory is ranked 22nd this year. If you want to be in Georgia (even Atlanta at a smaller firm) this would be a very good option. If there is a local school that is well-regarded by local firms, it can be worth a lower ranking for a scholarship. You'll want to talk to local employers about those options to get a good sense of your market. \n\nIt's much tougher to get good employment as you fall through the 30s through the 50s, and I would think seriously about going at all if these are your options (sliding scale, obviously). At this level, pay very, very close attention to their hiring stats and confirm what those numbers actually mean (schools love to cook that data, you want excellent bar passage on the first try, high numbers of people in permanent employment as lawyers after graduation, and a robust on-campus recruiting program). It's generally not a good idea to move more than a few slots down the ranking scale for a better scholarship. Instead, rethink whether law school makes sense for you. \n\nFor clarity, there's currently a 5-way tie for 50th with average LSATs usually in the upper 150s and GPA around 3.5. Around #25 averages LSATs are in the low-mid 160s and GPAs around 3.7. \n\nI usually tell people it's not worth doing law school if you're not getting upper 160s (at the least) on your LSAT and 3.7 undergrad GPA. Those two stats make up pretty much the entire admissions process, so as cool as your master's degree or your hard luck story is, it probably doesn't matter (unless you're an unrepresented minority, in which case it's a whole different ballgame). If you do go to a lower rank school, being at the top of your class will be vital (as opposed to top half for the better ranked options). \n\nTo be fair, I went to school during the depths of the recession when everyone decided to go to grad school so things were more competitive than they are now. \nHowever, in some ways the hiring market was actually doing better then and I think law made more sense as a long term career based on what we knew then v. now so I remain pessimistic, despite being very happy myself professionally. \n",

I could have gone for free to a couple higher ranked schools, but they were far away from the area I wanted to work in, which I think like you said is the main consideration for schools in that range. I didn't expect that to happen, as I was expecting to go to a top school, but then one of the top 20 schools offered me a full ride, and then they all started matching each other.\n\nIMO, free anywhere in top 25 is better than paying for anything outside of Yale or Harvard, and that's ONLY if you are dying for the SCOTUS clerkship shot or academia.  The bottom third of class flame outs of the top 25 are worse off than the top 14, but not by enough to make it worth the debt. \n\nAlso, pro-tip: don't take any \"you must maintain the top 10% rank\" scholarships. Law school grades are random as fuck sometimes and you never know.",

None of the others did, so i cant say how common it was. The school that I ultimately attended actually started at less than a full ride, but when I said I had full rides from other \"better\" schools, they raised it without any strings attached.\n\nAnd that's an A average probably, which of course 90% of the students don't get. My school used +/- GPA too, so a B- is less than a 3.0, and an A- is less than a 4.0, so grades were actually deflated.  \n\nI finished in the top 25%ish of my class, but I never sniffed the top 10%.

Biggest mistake of my life.\n\nEdit: to those suggesting that a scholarship could also make law school a good idea, I completely agree.

Fucking no. They 1, falsify employment reports, 2, call themselves the 2nd best law school in the country in their own law review that they own and operate even though they weren\u2019t even accredited by the ABA until 2018 because they finally were able to fix the shit show that was their constant lying and falsifying reports, and 3, they\u2019re GPA and LSAT requirements are a fucking joke. They take kids with below a 3.00 and under a 139 LSAT, under a 139 is pretty much failing the LSAT. They\u2019ll take whoever they can get take their money, then blow the money on hookers and cocaine while telling the kids that \u201coh, you\u2019ll get a job somewhere.\u201d \n\nGod damn it pisses me off how that \u201claw school \u201c can even operate considering how much of a fucking scam it is. They have the god damn gall to charge 51,000$ for shit like that. \n\nNever go to Cooley law school. You have a better chance of securing a job learning law in prison than you do learning law there. \n\nFucking joke. ",

I\u2019m a 2L, and I worked in a crim-immigration firm over the summer, and one of the lawyers had me read a brief by some prosecutor from Cooley. It was absolutely dreadful. She had entire paragraphs out of place, like she just forgot to delete them, but she repeated paragraphs in other places.\n\nI forget most of the arguments, but I remember one she conceded that the driveway was within the curtilage of the home for 4A purposes (wtf??), but then tried to argue that the screened-in back porch was not part of the curtilage, or, in the alternative, that the knock-and-talk exception applies because the police saw a neighbor used a key to unlock the fence, enter the backyard, and walk up to the porch, and it that showed it was the normal path to take. Therefore it made more sense for the police to immediately bypass the front door and go into the backyard.   \n\nWhat\u2019s even funnier is she completely missed an argument that the police could have entered the backyard to talk to the defendant without a warrant *despite* it being within the curtilage because the neighbor entering the backyard and porch probably meant the defendant was back there under Alvarez v. Montgomery County. \n\nWe had a good laugh. ",

The problem for future law grads probably won't be the dire financial straights or job insecurity.\n\nThe problem will be that being a lawyer is fucking hard. It is hard work, day in and day out. Long hours, tons of stress, constantly being second guessed by your employers, clients, and peers, etc. You have to make difficult decisions with no right answer and will be judged by people with the benefit of hindsight.\n\nThe pay is generally good, but people are forgetting that its a bi-modal curve. There are a few people on the very high end (let's just make up a number and say 20% of lawyers are making between $150,000 and $1,000,000 per year) and a ton of people at the low end (40% of lawyers making less than $50,000 per year). There are a lot of lawyers mixed around at other income brackets, but those aren't the norm. That means that unless you are in the top of your lawschool, it is unlikely that your career will be lucrative for some time. Eventually you'll probably settle into a job with a good salary - but not right away. And that's when your bills come due.\n\nOn top of the stress and hours, you have debt. That's the real gamble in all of this. Because if you drop a ton of money on a JD, you are now committed to a career path. If it turns out you like law school but don't like being a lawyer - tough shit. You gotta pay that debt back and guess what your most marketable skill is?\n\nAt any rate - I don't hate being a lawyer. But it is just a really hard job that I'll be doing for the next decade or two, minimum. That's a rough row to hoe when you get down to it. ",

I hope your career and financial situation has improved since then.",

                                    "comment": "So, here's the story: I started law school in August of 2008, two months later the world's economic life dies. I figured \"whatever, by the time I graduate things will be fine.\" Law school in the US is three years and during the summers you work an internship for a law firm or a public organization (District Attorney's office, public defender, etc) and in the past by the time you graduated you would have a job offer. During my first summer, there were no internships. Firms simply weren't doing it; they were laying lawyers off, not taking on new ones, not even interns. During my second summer, I cold-called law firms and offered to volunteer just so I could learn the ropes. They still wouldn't bite; they had no time to teach a new lawyer how to work. I graduated in NYC in May of 2011 and I have to move home to my parents' at the age of 27 because I have no job. I set up an office in their garage and I spent the summer studying for the bar. By August, I'm applying to any law job I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy November, I find out I passed the bar and I get sworn in; I'm a licensed attorney now, but no job. My loans are now due, but no non-law, yet still white-collar job will hire me because they know I'm a lawyer; they assume I'll just quit as soon as a law job comes through. I need money to pay my loans. A friend who manages the liquor warehouse offers me hours so I take them. I'm one of two attorneys and three people with a JD working at this warehouse. At this point, I decide to take the New York bar (I only took Jersey at first) to be able to cast a wider net with two law licenses. I study my butt off and pass the NY bar in February of 2012. I'm licensed in two states now. I apply to EVERY judge in the state of New Jersey for a clerkship; over 460. I get three interviews, no offers. I keep applying to every job I can find. I network with every connection I can. At this point I'm working as a substitute teacher in a high school, I'm helping my friend with his IT company, I\"m working as a leasing agent one day a week at an apartment complex, on weekend nights I'm running a photo booth at weddings and Sweet 16's, and on Sundays I'm back at the liquor store. I also create my own business and start my own law firm to try to get some experience; I do traffic tickets. The thing is: unless you've been trained by someone who knows law, you can't really do law without screwing yourself and your client. But remember, I had no internships and I've never worked as a lawyer. So I\"m stuck in the cycle of needing experience to get a job, but not having any experience cause I don't have a job. In April of 2013 I get an offer for a quasi-law job: $45K a year, but not enough to move out of my parents' house and pay my loans. A year later I get a better offer to work for a landlord-tenant firm for $55K. Cool! Private practice! I'm a real lawyer now! I figure I'll get bumped up to a real lawyer's salary in a few months. It never happens. I go to court every day on behalf of landlords, people cry and beg me not to evict them. It's horrible and miserable. I became a lawyer to help people; now I'm evicting them from their homes for $55K. Which was enough to move out and get my own place at the age of 30, but I'm paycheck to paycheck; breaking even every month. I only last 10 months selling my soul to eat ramen every night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hear about this thing called Document Review. It pays about the same as my current job, but no stress and no bad karma. I quit the Landlord firm and start doing doc review. You sit in front of a computer for 10 hours a day and read documents on a screen and look for certain legal details and stuff that's relevant to the case. Pre-recession, this was the work for the first year associates in a law firm making about $70K; but after the recession law firms started outsourcing it to small firms that just hire attorneys for short term stints and pay them $30 an hour. It's not a terrible salary (but it's awful when you consider the fact that you borrowed $100K+ to go to law school) But I'm a contractor which means I have no benefits, no sick days, no holidays. If you don't work, you don't get paid. You get laid off a lot and move between different staffing agencies often when cases end or settle. I'm making about $50K when you factor in no benefits, but with the loans, I\"m squeaking by. I do this for about two years. I go to networking events to try to break away from law and get started in another field. I apply to insurance companies, tech startups, ANYTHING I can think of! No one will give me a chance because I'm a lawyer and not trained in whatever field their business is in. I can't go back to school and take out more loans.  Finally I melt down. My lease is ending, I have no permanent job, no way to get a new, cheaper lease without a permanent job. I'm in despair and have no idea what to do so I say to myself \"Don't get a new job, don't get a new apartment; just leave.\" On August 13th, 2016, I got in my car with a tent and camping equipment and started driving west. I thought I'd be gone for about 2 months, I ended up being gone for five and half. I stayed with friends and family and lived in my tent and traveled around the entire country; state and National Parks became home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got back to Jersey in January of 2017, chilled out a bit and reevaluated my values. Decided I was done chasing a higher salary and just decided to live with less and not more. - I went back to doing doc review, refinanced some loans, paid some off, and applied for things I really wanted to do while living in a one-room cabin in Central Jersey. Things took a turn for the better and in April of 2018 I started my first season as a Park Ranger for the National Park Service and this past summer was the most fulfilling 6 months of my entire life. For the first time in my life, all my work and life experience actually made me better and adept at my job; and I excelled. In October of 2018 I was named Ranger of the Month for Gateway National Recreation Area. Everyone starts out as a seasonal Ranger in the NPS, so the job ended at the end of October and I started document review again in December which I'm currently doing in New York City while I wait to hear about my applications for the 2019 National Park Season. (I apologize for typos, poor grammar, and stream of consciousness; it's hard to distill 10 years into a coherent post.) So my advice is: Don't go to law school. Go to the forest instead.\n\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\n\nMany have asked about the ranger job and the loans so here's some details:\n\nFirstly, I applied to the ranger jobs after the camping trip in 2017 but didn't get hired. I networked with some rangers who gave some advice on how to structure my resume and application. It worked and I got hired for the 2018 season. I'm an Eagle Scout, had lots of outdoor experience, experience as an actor, and I'm a scholar of history. I've also done some Civil War re-enacting. All these factors made me a good fit to run programs and events at Fort Wadsworth; a Civil War-era fortress on Staten Island built to defend NY harbor. I was an interpretation ranger which means I run/facilitate programs with the public. Host tours, develop new events, create content for social media, and do the nighttime lantern tours! (Those are the best! Walking around a Civil War fort at night; never thought I'd be doing that when I was sitting in court waiting for the judge.) The shutdown did affect hiring but they've begun contacting applicants this week.\n\nAs far as the loans: they are not paid off and won't be for a long time. I paid off some, refinancing helped with the interest on others, and I got some help from family. Honestly, living on the road and thinking about soldiers during the Civil War has changed my economic life. I cut expenses every way I can. I rent a single room in an apartment. I work from 9-7 every day and I bring a bag lunch and dinner with me every day. \\[A full day's rations, if you will. ;)\\] I plan to work in parts of the country that are much more affordable as well.\n\nBUT, and this is the MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS POST: I am super, super, super, super, super, super fortunate. I have family and friends who stood by me throughout the entire ordeal. I'm single and I have no kids. I only have to worry about myself. I thought I knew what stress was until I saw friends with children get laid off from their jobs. I am not special and I am not unique. Look at the responses to this post. Look at the stories people are sharing. There are millions, MILLIONS, just like me. Millions who got thrashed and wrecked by the economy. I found a way to make a rough situation work for my goals and values and tolerances, but there are millions who continue to struggle and who have no alternatives; who don't have the luxury of dropping what torments them and moving on to a new life. We all got destroyed in '08. Let's support each other and let's never forget what this feels like. Someday we'll own or run companies or be someone's manager or be political leaders. Let's never forget how this humbled us.",

Applied to every firm in my area. Did some research for a sole practicioner for a while and he hired me on a little but then folded. Took my wife and family a long time to understand there just wasn't anything out there. Everyone thought I was just lazy and \"not trying hard enough\", sucked.\n\nNow I'm working HR for a school District and it's not terrible but it sucks that I've basically ruined my life with student debt and never even got to do what I went to school for.",

They offered me a tiny scholarship so 22-year-old me took it. Graduated in 2012, found a job paying $20/hr, also doing landlord tenant work. I did a little document review for extra income while working there, but I lasted 6 months before I decided to move for better opportunities after I saw everyone around me doing the same if not worse. \n\nI landed a job making $50k doing workers compensation. It was the only place that would hire me as an attorney despite not yet being barred in that jurisdiction.  I was offered a job doing the defense side 2 years later. I\u2019ve been here for 3 years, and I\u2019m making six figures and on track to make partner. I\u2019ll be paying off my loans for 20 years, as well, but I still make enough to feel financially stable and comfortable. \n\nWould I have gone to law school if I could do it all over again? God no. I routinely tell people looking to go to law school that the work and money just aren\u2019t worth the debt. They never listen, just like I didn\u2019t listen. So it goes. \n\nPlease, OP, become a park ranger instead. ",

I do family law, and for the most part I enjoy my job and helping kids, but most people in those situations are ungrateful.  I'm constantly told that I not worth what I charge in a variety of ways.",

I was lucky enough to make decent-ish money, but had to move far away and live in crappy apartments for almost ten years.\n\n[CNBC reported the median private sector salary for J.D. recipients is $68,300, and the median public sector salary is $52,000.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/only-23-percent-of-law-school-grads-say-their-education-was-worth-the-cost.html) (edit: as pointed out, this is for *entry level JDs*). The median household income in the US was  [$61,372 in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States). Let that sink in. (edit: as also explained below by others, there are other ways of calculating relative value. They have a point).\n\nPeople who tell you stories of 'making it' as a BigLaw (ugh) attorney are selling you a pipe dream. As a non big-law attorney, you will be churning out workers' comp claims, or handling personal bankruptcy or family law cases, or, if you're lucky, prosecuting or defending misdemeanor DUIs on the outskirts of town, in front of Justices of the Peace who never went to law school. I could go on and on and on about this - [most attorneys work in solo or small practices](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/marketresearch/PublicDocuments/lawyer_demographics_2013.authcheckdam.pdf), et cetera, et cetera.\n\nIn all candor, I worked as an attorney for nearly ten years before I got totally burnt out and went to another career. I make twenty percent less money and it has been the best decision of my life. I no longer smoke, my diet has improved, I no longer hate waking up in the morning. I wake up and go to sleep at reasonable times. I do not wake up in a panic about a court filing, or about people threatening my livelihood.  I am not exaggerating.\n\nThere are many, many things you can do with $50,000 cash. Depending where you live, that's a down payment on a nice house. Hell, that's more than half a house in some parts of the country. You could invest in rental real estate, you could invest in an index fund and generate thousands of dollars per year - the net present value of that $50,000 when compared to its utility as a subsidy of expected future earnings \\[is\\] huge.\n\nI shudder to think at all of the money I spent paying back student loans - money that could have been invested into what became the longest bull market in living memory. At this point, if I had saved all of the money I spent on student loans, I could probably be generating $10,000 to $20,000 in passive income per year at a rate of return of 6 percent, assuming I had saved the money as I earned it over the last ten years. That is worth way, way more than the slightly increased income I earn because of my JD, just comparing it to the difference between average JD and average household income.\n\nSave your money.\n\n*General Edit*: I want to say to the folks critiquing the stats I used that your input is largely correct, and I appreciate it. I maintain the return on investment for me, a person whose legal career was pretty average, is *very* iffy both in the monetary and psychological senses. I loved being an attorney for about five years, and then hated it for the other four. Your mileage may vary.",

That will let you enjoy your education, will help you get better grades (because it excites you) and probably make you come off better in interviews.\n\nBut if you are doing that, don't skimp on the non-major electives and summer work.  Take some shit that makes you look hire-able.  Economics, a basic Stats class, something that makes you learn to code a bit (sure, you can learn on your own, but unless you have a portfolio of work to present employers, it is much easier for them to believe you if your transcript says you took CS101).  You don't have to major in Econ or Business to get a \"business\" job...but you need to be able to show that you are capable of learning the right skills.\n\nTry to find some decent work experience over the summers.  First summer you can get away with some hourly high-school-level job (or some sort of academic trip/excursion), but summer after your sophomore year you should try to have some internship that at least resembles an adult job in a field you are interested in.  It can be a low-profile company or a crappy job, but that experience will make it easier to get a primo internship with a well known company after your junior year.  A good junior summer internship is clutch because they will either make you a full time offer, or having that on your resume will really help you out looking for other full time offers.\n\nSo if you really want to major in Bio but have zero desire to work in a lab or get a PhD...That's fine.  Or if you are really interested in psychology or history.  Just make sure you also include the elective courses and internships that show you are a versatile learner and capable worker.",

I will never be able to retire, most of my paycheck goes toward loans, and the interest on those loans has snowballed thanks to those early years. My decision ruined my life. \n\nThere are far more lawyers than law jobs. Do anything else.",

I consider the day I dropped out to be one of the greatest days of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recommend against going to law school unless at least one of the following is true:\n\n  \n1. One of your parents/close relatives is an attorney and will give you a job right out of school  \n\n\n2. You get scholarships that pay for 80% or more of school.  \n\n\n3. You are accepted into a T15 school.  \n\n\nIt's not just the $ that school costs you'd be giving up. You'll also have to give up any money you would have made while you're in school. If you make $50K/year and school costs $50K/year, it costs $150K cash and another $150K in opportunity cost. You'll be pretty lucky if it costs you only $300K between salary lost and actual school costs.  \n\n\nFrankly, it's idiotic to view it as an investment, considering that you'll very likely have to work as an attorney for the rest of your life, afterwards. What amount of money is worth it if you hate the work? ",

In that you are finding out NOW that law school might not be what you want in life.  So much better to find out now rather than, say, in a year in to law school. You've got lots of options at this point, and $50K in the bank. \n \nThis happened to my husband as well (except for the money in the bank part). Raised all his life with expectation he would be a lawyer (he is clever). Didn't have money after college graduation, so took a random job that paid commission that he was no good at. Starving, barely able to pay rent, he took a retail job and was quickly made a manager. Married me, decided to sit for the LSAT finally, since my income could support us - and he didn't do well. Now what?  \n \nHe ended up finding a different path, and later we started our own company. Turned out he was a born entrepreneur. Not a born attorney.  \n \nIf you are interested in legal, why not become a paralegal and see if that's for you? ",

If you can't think of anything more useful to do, but you *can* think of something you would love but requires a different degree than whatever your first one was, it's better to change career paths by getting a second undergrad degree than to force your way into a professional school that you'll hate.

Or it can mean standing in court before judges all the time, interviewing clients, and handling the practical side of getting evidence and negotiating with other lawyers/parties.\n\nPersonally, I work 8:30-5 most days, sometimes later. I've almost never had to work on a weekend, and have only once had my holiday ruined by a client. I could probably have ignored him if I had to. \n\nI get a decent salary, pay all my bills and have started some savings, and I'm expecting a raise fairly soon (coming up on 1 year at it). I spend a decent amount of time in court, and some truly horrible days struggling to figure out how to handle some part of a conveyance or other process.\n\n... My point being, don't just look at law as an investment. Figure out if it's something you'd actually want to do, versus living for a paycheque and retirement. For me, some days suck. But some don't. I've spent all morning trying to get an actual Canadian legal definition of what it means to molest a fish. (If I was a sole practitioner this would probably be a tremendous waste of time, but I was assigned to do it.) \n\nThat said, I took the LSAT and I knew law would be for me. I struggled on some parts, but logic and reading comprehension come easily to me and I scored well without much practice. I spent the next 3 years in law school second-guessing myself, and I assure you I was not alone in that. It's part of what might make you a good lawyer, if you're always doubting yourself and re-evaluating your position. \n\n\n.... Not that that gives you any financial advice, but there's some life advice for you. \n\n",

Nothing groundbreaking.\n\n I have a parent who is a lawyer, so I grew up around it and knew exactly what it was. Beyond that, I had a sense of where the money was (practice areas) and how I could position myself to get there. When I went to law school, I knew exactly what I wanted to do and knew how to get there. Financially, my parents were able to help me out with school (I still borrowed over 100k) and keep me afloat my first year or so of practice, when I got a job at a great firm with great exit opportunities, but wasn\u2019t making a whole lot of money. I was a good student, graduated with honors from a top 50 school, but wasn\u2019t big law material. Most people are not in my situation and I\u2019ve been extremely fortunate. Without  I would have had to take slightly higher paying jobs at firms that didn\u2019t do what I wanted to do. \n\nI like being a lawyer (most days) and I think there\u2019s a ton of perks to the job, and freedoms that come with being a professional. Nobody tells me when I need to be at work and I have a ton of control over my day to day life. But it\u2019s not really a \u201cjob,\u201d it\u2019s a 24/7 career that never stops and requires your total dedication. And there are many practice areas that just suck. I work in a good one that has high billable rates so I work less hours. I have some friends doing less prestigious stuff with lower billable rates who work significantly more hours on completely mundane cases. I couldn\u2019t imagine being a lawyer if I was doing what they do. \n\nIf you\u2019re going anywhere other than a top 14 school, you need to really evaluate what kind of work you\u2019d want to do. Because it\u2019s far more likely that you\u2019ll end up defending slip and falls than doing something exciting and sexy. And if you aren\u2019t okay with that, then you should think long and hard about becoming a lawyer.",

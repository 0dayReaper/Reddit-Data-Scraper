    "postText": "Thanks everyone who commented on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/145nyd2/unexpected_large_hoa_assessment_best_option/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) about this situation. To recap, I likely have a roughly $40,000 surprise HOA assessment coming and I'm trying to determine the best way to pay it. After all the feedback, I've got a two part plan, and would love feedback on each. (Apologies for the long post!)\n\n**Part 1**\n\n* Pay $20,000 from my emergency fund - *this will leave me with about 3 months expenses in the fund, in case of job loss or medical emergency. (I know some people are less risk averse and would say, just use all the cash and be done, but I'm just not there.)*\n* Put $20,580 ($20k + 2.9% fee) on a 0% APR credit card for the remainder of the 8 mo promotional period - *I'll aggressively pay this down over the 8 months to get as close to $15,000 as possible by the end*\n\n**Part 2**\n\n* Take out *either* a 401(k) Loan (Roth funds) *or* from a HELOC for the remaining balance\n* Pay off the credit card and then pay down the loan as aggressively as possible, using bonuses as lump sum payments\n\nThere are so many moving pieces to this that I can't be sure I've done all my math on all my options completely perfectly, but I believe the 8 months of free financing on the credit card makes sense. The interest gained on the money plus the cash back more than covers the processing fee, and the 0% financing period to make payments during helps reduce the principal of whatever loan option I choose...thus reducing overall interest.\n\nWhere I'm waffling is the 401(k) loan vs a HELOC. Based on the majority of replies in the other post, it seems people are quite averse to borrowing against the 401(k). To be clear though, in my case, the 401(k) is:\n\n* A Solo 401(k) through an administrator I hired, associated to a side business which I don't anticipate going away within the next 5 years\n* The funds would be Roth, so I would be paying back taxed dollars with taxed dollars\n* I am contributing to my full-time employer's 401(k), so I do not care about not having contributions during the loan period\n\nSince the expected interest rate would be 9.25% - 10.25% (still waiting on confirmation), the only way I'd lose money in that 401(k) account is if the market returned over 10.25% over that 5 year period. Possible? Yes. Probable? Who knows. Guaranteed? Certainly not.\n\nThe other suggestion that seemed most appealing was a HELOC. I haven't gotten any confirmed rates for that yet, but I did get a home equity loan offer rate of 11.74%, so I'll assume the HELOC would be around that. If I paid it off in:\n\n* 5 years: $442/mo =&gt; $6,520 in interest\n* 10 years: $284/mo =&gt; $14,080 in interest\n\nSure, the HELOC is \"more flexible\", but I can't see a financial justification given how high interest rates are and that that high interest is being paid to a bank rather than to myself with the 401(k) loan. I guess the only other factor would be if the lower monthly payments allow me to invest elsewhere during that time at a higher rate of return than paying off this loan...but again, given how high the HELOC rate would be, I sincerely doubt that is a reasonable expectation.\n\nThanks in advance for reading this much and for any advice/perspectives/feedback!",

I called in and had them re-run it and the guy said there was no offer.\n\nI have 800+ FICO scores across all bureaus (with 30+ reported credit/lease/loan/mortgage accounts spanning 15+ years, all in good standing), so I asked why. He said the details would be in the letter but that he could offer some general info, saying that my credit age was too low. He claimed that Discover only looks at open credit lines for age, rather than everything on the credit report. I found that slightly absurd, but who am I to argue?\n\nAnyway, a couple hours later, I get an email from Discover saying that my recent pre-qualification application was cancelled due to my credit report being frozen...turns out, I had only unfrozen TU and Equifax. I had Experian open, but didn't click to unfreeze. So...I think the rep was just blowing hot air.\n\nSoFi approved me (pre-qualification) after that but with an 11% rate for a 2 year loan and going up to 14% for 7 years. Needless to say, that was not very compelling.",

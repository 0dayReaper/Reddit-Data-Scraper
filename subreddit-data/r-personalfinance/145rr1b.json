    "postText": "I got an email from collection agency with their email being; notifications@acsemails.com\n\nFirst, I do owe money from ReadyRefresh by Nestle. Before it was only like $28 but with their predatory late fees and penalties. It went up to $160. Trust me, I have been trying to cancel their water delivery service for a long time but they make it so difficult. Second, I saw another email that is the same as this. Everything is the same except that the other balance is $76. So I have no clue why there\u2019s two balances. Third, will this hurt my credit score? \n\nI thought having debt in credit card or medical bill or rent or mortgage is the only thing that will affect credit scores. How is a water delivery service ruining my credit card when I was paying or had autopay on my debit card. If anything, the account was under my name but we were using my gf\u2019s debit card. So where would the actual debt go? I also don\u2019t want to ruin my partner\u2019s credit score because of my lack of understanding with credit and debts.\n\nWhere do I go from here? Im planning to pay it off properly. Im in California. Please lend me your knowledge. Thank you.\n\n\n(\n\nPENDING PAYMENT OFFER\n\nMy Name \n\nAddress\n\nCreditor: Readyrefresh\n\nOur Account Number: 176##### \n\nOriginal Account Number: 670#######\n\nBalance: $159.99 \n\nDear Name, \n\nDespite our attempts to reach you, your account remains significantly past due.

Would skipping my next payment be a dumb idea?  I\u2019d rather have that cash in hand than pay it just to get it back from the proceeds, but wonder if I\u2019m missing something. Thanks!",

It seems risky to me to not pay the 7/1 mortgage payment.",

So you\u2019re closing before it\u2019s late, but if your mortgage provider gave them a payoff amount that included you making the July payment then you\u2019ll be short that money and have to deal with it - risking being late because your account might not fully reflect the amount from the sale until your mortgage payment is late.\n\nI\u2019m not sure who to ask that question as I haven\u2019t sold a house just refi and they always told me yes or not to the next payment - your mortgage provider? Your realtor might know? Might be spelled out in the docs you have?",

They\u2019ll call your mortgage broker to get the pay-off amount for the closing paperwork and the fact that you haven\u2019t paid on 07/01 will come up. Leave no surprises. Just let them know that the settlement amount won\u2019t include the July payment so they aren\u2019t expecting it (and if there are late fees they\u2019ll deduct them from your settlement check). Be prepared to make the payment in case there is a hiccup in the closing.\n\nLate payments under 30 days are not usually not reported to the credit agencies.",

    "postText": "A thanks in advance to everyone that throws their 2 cents in.\n\nI have a question about how to place my excess money. I understand i am in a fortunate situation and would like to make the best choices possible. \n\nMy wife and i will be able to max our three (x2- Roth 403b with 3% max match, Roth ira, and HSA) tax advantaged accounts starting in august and i am going to start a brokerage account for excess income we dont use since i would rather save/invest than spend. We recently bought a house last year with a 4.15% rate on a 10 year ARM, with the goal of leaving the area within 8-10 years once are kids are close to school age- with the goal of going to a better school district. This however also brings higher house prices.\n\nI plan on putting money into a brokerage account and investing with the Bogleheads method or FXAIX and investing about ~2.5k-3k monthly with reinvested dividends for ~8-10 years. \n\n- The question is do i pull out a large chunk for a down payment on a new house/new build to add to the sale of our current home, or do i keep the money in the account and exchange a portion of the whole account for a dividend paying fund and use the dividends from that to assist with monthly payments, while the remainder continues to grow as FXAIX/whatever index fund.\n\n- if the answer is exchange only part of it, which dividend paying fund should i aim for?\n\nOnce again, thanks for the help everyone",

It is my understanding that roth will allow me to report a lower income in retirement as opposed to a traditional ira account, which seems beneficial. Please excuse me if this screams ignorance, i am happy to hear arguments against this. Our combined household gross income should be around 600k in the next year with monthly expenses less than 7k.\n\nI only ask as I worry about folks who fall for the misguided myth that \"Roth is always best\" because of the misguided notion that \"Tax-free is always best.\"  Tax-efficiency is what you should actually look to prioritize.\n\n: tax efficiency- other than a financial advisor where do i learn more?\n\nAnyways, your question really is:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060I have $XYZ amount of money\n\u2022\t\u2060I have a need in 8-10 years\n\u2022\t\u2060How do I prepare for this need while experiencing exposure to market risk?\n\nThe way to approach this is to have a pre-defined plan for moving the money out of investments/market exposure to cash/cash equivalents.\n\nThis will depend on your risk appetite.\n\nOne example of an approach would be to start at 100% equity exposure in year 1.

However should i remove a whole amount from the brokerage or only some, given that at the point of 10 years with approx. 2.5k a month at 10% with reinvested dividends would be about 500k of account value (using rough estimates for FXAIX and a quick smart asset calculator, i know this is very primitive). Would there be potential loss of momentum if i pull out all of the money OR should i convert some to a dividend paying fund instead of going to cash. Apologies if I misunderstood what you wrote or incorrectly stated something in my reply\n\nEDIT: Thank you for replying",

Needing some advice on this whole life insurance thing.\n\nBeen quoted $300 a month for Universal Life Insurance with a death payout of $1M.\n\nDoing some quick math I am currently 25 and avg life span of about 75-80 (let\u2019s say another 55 years) \n\n300 x 12 x 55 = 198K \n\nThat Would mean a about a 5X payout for my beneficiaries. Planning to have a family in the next 3-5 years and so needing some advice. \n\nAlso, done some research and said investing the same amount monthly into ETFs and other investments could make your payout much higher? \n\nAny advice would be great, thanks!!",

If you have named beneficiaries on your accounts, you also avoid probate.\n\nMy point is: if you take the amount of money whole life premiums cost, and instead of buying whole life (or universal life, etc.), you buy term life for the same benefit amount and invest the remainder yourself in market indices (doesn't have to be ETFs, could be mutual funds, etc), then you will have more money at the end of your term policy than you'd have in cash value for your whole/universal life policy.\n\nFor most people, buying whole life is sort of like paying $400,000 for a $200,000 house. Yeah, you get a house, and the house itself does exactly what it said it would, but you definitely overpaid.\n\n[PBS has a good video explaining this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgBhy8iXjpI).\n\nedit: [Another explanation from an insurance agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YlferjOL8o).",

Whole life still has that cost, but you don't see it because you don't get a breakdown of where your premium dollars are actually going (a shockingly high percentage of them would be going to commissions and fees for the insurer).\n\nIt is much better to get term insurance, where you pay that actual cost of insuring against your death, you can increase or decrease your coverage through your life as your needs change, and you can shop your policy around and change insurers if a cheaper policy is available from a competitor.",

For example a member of my family has a heart condition which makes it difficult for us to get health insurance.  The heart condition isn't even genetic but it falls into a broad category which makes insurers nervous. Family members have been refused cover because of it. This is also a problem because once you have been refused cover you have to report in on future applications.",

If buying Term, make sure that you purchase a convertible policy. Convertible as in being able to convert it to permanent later. Also, make sure that the policy goes until you are 100+, not just 80.  If you outlive the policy, then all the money that you put in is gone forever.",

You can only get back money you put in tax free, not any gains\n\nThat's incorrect... Growth can be taken tax free if the distributions are structured as a loan, and as long as the policy is in force you pay no tax. The strategy is to build a minimum death benefit policy, max fund it, and never let the policy run entirely out of cash.\n\nPermanent life insurance is FIFO, so you can withdraw up to your basis tax free before pulling the growth out as a loan.\n\n&gt; and life insurance death benefits are part of the estate for tax purposes unless the policy is in an irrevocable life insurance trust and then you definitely can't access the money before you die. \n\nOkay? It sounds like you're trying to show that you're knowledgeable about this, but that doesn't really have anything to do with this. Obviously with this strategy the policy isn't put into an irrevocable trust. And yes, the death benefits are included in the estate, but with this strategy the owner/insured of the policy is generally stripping the policy of all of its value during their lifetime (again, tax-free), as opposed to leaving a big death benefit to their heirs. It's just using the policy in a different way.\n\n&gt; IDK life insurance is often sold as tax advantaged, but there are so many strings attached, most people, even the very wealthy, would be better off just paying the taxes.\n\nI wouldn't say there are strings attached. There are methods that need to be known and followed using this strategy, but that's what FAs are for. And you are drastically underrating the tax that the ultra wealthy can avoid by using strategies like this. They can pay a fee based FA like $2K a year to monitor this stuff and save literally hundreds of thousands in tax. It's a very easy decision to make and is definitely not overrated.",

My retirement accounts will be active for the rest of my life until I exhaust them or I die. Most people use the life insurance strategy as a retirement account as well, so it's really no different.\n\n&gt; You can take your contributions out tax free from any other taxable investment (such as a brokerage) or borrow against your invested assets.\n\nA brokerage is an account, not an investment. The investments are the securities that are bought within the account. And different investments sometimes have different tax rules. If you want to borrow from your assets in a brokerage you have to have a margin account. But the second you sell a security in a brokerage account you owe tax on growth (for most securities, not all), so not really seeing how you think that's better. The only option that is really verifiably better would be a Roth, which has the same tax environment, but because it's a pure investment vehicle the fees are lower. However, in a Roth your annual limit is $6K (assuming you don't make too much money to be eligible at all), whereas the life insurance plans can be built around any annual contribution amount. I have clients who fund $100K/annum in these plans.\n\n&gt; Likewise you could put a better investment in an irrevocable trust and have it pass to your heirs without it adding to the size of your estate.\n\nYou're talking about different things here. You're correct, but you're talking about estate planning. The life insurance strategy I'm talking about is income planning. How would an irrevocable trust serve the same planning purpose if someone is looking to shelter income from tax during their lifetime? If you're confident there are better options, tell me an option where wealthy people have no limit on contributions, can invest into market-based funds, and can pull out all their money tax-free at literally any time...\n\n&gt; Maybe I'm missing something but I'm not seeing how the fact that it's \"life insurance\" makes it tax advantaged at all, as opposed to other taxable investments.\n\nI've explained it to you already. You build a policy with a minimum death benefit to keep the fees as low as possible and prevent the policy from becoming a MEC, max fund it, and you have a plan with Roth taxation as long as distributions are structured correctly. That's how it's tax advantaged. It's not for everyone, but it's extremely useful for some. If you want to learn more about it, google \"rich person roth\". There's a Forbes article that was written a few years ago with that title.",

A CD is an investment; specifically, it is a risk-fee, fixed income investment.  Anything one puts capital with the goal of later extracting value from is an investment.  be it a stock, a fixed income product, cryptocurrency, gold coins, or baseball cards.\n\n&gt; It\u2019s a fixed insurance product with a death benefit that outpaces inflation and avoids probate\n\nWhich will almost certainly underperform a term insurance policy combined with an equity-heavy investment portfolio.  \n\n&gt; It\u2019s not appropriate to sell it as an investment, and it\u2019s equally inappropriate to discredit it based on it not being an investment\n\nIt is an investment (once you back out the death benefit).

In itself, it is a fantastic investment when handled correctly.\n\nYou will probably also want to diversify your investments.  EFT's can be an iffy investment.

This is a real value. \n\n2) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: Full life should only be Considered if you are already maxing out your 401k contributions (and at 25, a Roth 401k is probable the better move) AND your back door Roth 401k. That is ~28k per year. These are cheaper options to obtain tax free growth. \n\n3) if you are maxing out your 401k/IR\u00c1 and your back door Roth then you may consider whole life as an investment \n\n4) There are a ton of companies offering whole life insurance. Most are shit, some are quite good (for those people that meet point 1&amp;2)\n\n5) if you want the life insurance, get Term. If you\u2019ve maxed out all your retirement contributions and still want to save more for retirement, talk to someone who is smarter than I regarding which companies offer the best full/whole life\n\n6) insurance salespeople/financial advisors get BIG commission selling whole life.

                            "comment": "Ok -\n\nBack to the top. There are 2 types of life insurance. \n\n1) Term Life: this is like car insurance. You pay a monthly fee and if you die before the \u201cterm\u201d ends, your designated beneficiaries get a payout. If all you are looking is a $1M insurance policy, $300/month is insane. $1 Term policy for. A healthy 25 y/o should be less than $50/month\n\n2) Whole Life/Full Life/Universal life insurance. All of these are products that have two pieces to them. \n\n-  they carry a Term Life piece that acts just like a term policy and pays out when you die (just like #1)\n\n- they also include an investment portion. They take the \u201cextra\u201d money above what it takes to pay for the term life coverage and invest it for you. The investments can vary depending on the company. This investment grows tax free\n\nSUMMARY - If all you want is a $1M safety net in case you die, get Term. Only consider Universal life if you are already maxing out 401k &amp; back door Roths\n\nFor most people (especially someone 25), go get cheap term life for &lt;$50/month and invest the other $250 in a low fee ETF or fund",

If they grow at the inflation rate, you\u2019re just breaking even. \n\nI had one of them universal life policies that shows you those beautiful charts and graphs, but at the bottom it said you are only guaranteed like 1%. \n\nThe graphs and charts show you what you would get at a given rate that you are not going to get unless inflation goes crazy but you are still just breaking even. \n\nAfter I maxed out my 401k and IRA, it was an opportunity to make a lot of money off of pre-taxed money.

You are getting upvoted and I'm getting downvoted though, so congratulations I guess?\n\nFirst off, this isn't an investment first, insurance second, it's an insurance policy with some vested benefits. Already this is one of those comparing apples to oranges conversations. I actually feel a need to have supplemental insurance because I am more likely to suddenly die than most people. I'm paying for a $347k death benefit. That's the whole point. The other vested income stuff was never supposed to be a particularly great investment in the first place it's just some extra stuff that's nice to have. It does accrue SOME value over time, after all. I've listed the other features that are also some nice to haves, the terminal illness rider with fill death benefit payout being one of them if i should get cancer or something, which did happen to several relatives of mine.\n\n&gt; If you live to life expectancy, you would have paid about 100,000 dollars.\n\nFuzzy math on that. I think you're just taking $200 x 12 x 40 (my age when i started to age 70 or so?) which gives you 96k, but when I started it was about $135 and it's ramped up to $200 over 13 years. \n\n&gt; that could be worth more than 10 million if you invested it in the stock market at 10%\n\nBut if I could make that sort of money in the stock market reliably I wouldn't be in this subreddit in the first place talking to you, now would I. I use an IRA and a 401k as my retirement vehicles.\n\nThis has been a profitable exercise though because after looking into it that 5% APR loan they offer I just found out about is definitely something i'm going to use to refinance another loan I have at a less favorable rate.",

Life insurance is only needed if you have someone depending on your income to satisfy unfunded obligations (mortgage payment, college, etc). You don\u2019t have a family so I assume you have no one dependent on you.\n\nNext life insurance is only needed while you don\u2019t have cash or investments to cover those unfunded obligations. So let\u2019s say you do have a family. You\u2019d only need insurance until you have the house paid off or college fund set up etc. after that it\u2019s not needed.\n\nSo, let\u2019s stick with the realm where you do have dependent obligations. Since you won\u2019t need it forever consider term insurance instead because it is literally designed to float you until you have satisfied those funds.\n\nBuy term for insurance and buy equities/bonds for investments. Don\u2019t try and mix the two because the mixed product will do a worse job at each. Even if you spent that same 300/mo you could likely get yourself a 30 year policy and invest the remainder and result with far more in earnings with greater insurance coverage.\n\nGoing forward, you really shouldn\u2019t buy any type of investment vehicle that is too difficult to understand. More often than not that means it has some sort of unnecessary fee built in/associated with it.\n\nIn perspective, whole policies generally have all sorts of restricting clauses that limit how much you can withdraw from your cash value etc, earning caps, and all sorts of other nasty things.",

If you belong to a local credit union, check to see if they have term policies for their members.

            "comment": "For most whole life (or any permanent life ) is not needed and is expensive versus term for income replacement. Whole life is not targeted for income replacement. \nI can think of three areas where someone may explore (and get a fee only insurance advisor to build policy not an agent )\n1) special needs dependent that you want to protect (trust is likely easier but when you\u2019re young you may not have sufficient assets for a trust ) no matter what when you pass (and special needs different from kids that age into hopefully self sufficient)\n2) key man insurance for small business. You and your partners or family cover you to afford to buy out the business should you pass unexpectedly. This is actually fairly common and again a fee only adviser can help. Do not use agents. \n3) tax avoidance - for example google Jim harbaugh U of M football coach. A substantial portion of his salary is paid by his employer to buy whole life that Jim owns. Jim then takes a loan against the policy tax free. That\u2019s a well known example but high income folks utilize this method. \n\nI bought a whole life policy when young without knowing all the facts. I\u2019ve kept it into older years but would not suggest it for most. None of the above scenarios applied to me. I\u2019ll hang on to it and probably let my kids take the payout when I pass. \n\nMy advice for younger people, but term early if you plan on having dependents. Take your health seriously so with or without life insurance you enjoy being healthy!",

On their 20th birthday, their present from me will be this policy. They can choose to increase it without a physical at certain ages, and pay more into it, or leave it alone and have it forever. Good use for UL, basic minimum coverage, definitely not $1M. I have a 20 year refundable policy for $250k from 10 years ago, I should have gotten much more. Now I\u2019m looking for additional term coverage and 10 years older, is much more expensive.",

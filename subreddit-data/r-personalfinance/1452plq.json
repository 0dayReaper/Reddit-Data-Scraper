    "postText": "I've seen the buying vs. renting topic come up a million times. But I've always felt like it was a no-brainer when you break down what you're getting for your money. Both rent and a mortgage account for the price of the residence, taxes, and insurance. But when you consider that part of your mortgage is banked away for you to access eventually, it's not even a question to me.\n\nImagine you go to rent a place and the landlord says that it'll be $2K a month. But he also says he'll put aside $500 of the $2K into a bank account he won't touch. He'll loan that money out to you at an interest rate that's typically less than the rate for a personal loan whenever you want. And when you move out, he'll landlord will take ~15% of the money in the account and give you the rest. And even better, he'll put an extra $2 into the account every month. If any of you went to an apartment right now and they offered this to you, you'd think it's a fucking scam because that's way too good to be true. But when presented this scenario in the form of a mortgage, people want to break out the calculators and policy papers.\n\nI know some proponents of renting will say that there are additional costs to owning like maintenance and repairs which renters don't have to worry about. And while that's true in the sense that you'll never have to pay extra for it, any landlord worth their salt has factored that, taxes, insurance, and a healthy profit for themselves into whatever your rent payment is. So if you're not regularly getting things fixed or upgraded you're actually paying more than someone who owns for it. And if you're getting over on the landlord in any of this, I guarantee they'll get it back once the lease is up for renewal.\n\nI also think the government incentivizes owning so much because they know Americans don't save and a mortgage is in many ways a forced savings account. For most people the money they get from selling a house is the most cash they'll ever have in their bank account. And yes I know the value of a house can drop but when you look historically, it's a rarity that it drops to the point where people are underwater. It's just that most of us were alive to see it happen en masse so it's more top of mind for us.\n\nYMMV on this but I personally don't even consider the principle portion of my mortgage as spent money. So whenever I do a mortgage vs. rent calculation the comparison is Mortgage-Principle=Rent. But definitely open to any arguments against this.",

Renting vs buying is an extremely multi-faceted situation and is very much a 1 of 1 situation for every person faced with the choice.",

Younger folks tend to rent because affordability but also because they're still figuring out a career path and where they want to end up. Renting seems easier and more flexible for those reasons. When is more established in a job and has more money for down payments/emergency fund and are looking for stability then owning becomes a possibility.",

It counts in the calculation. The financial benefit, if any, of ownership is in the net capital gain. If you didn't include principal payments in the cashflows then you would be double-counting.",

But broadly speaking, excluding principal can be appropriate for some purposes.\n\nBut if you're looking at cash flow to decide how much your monthly budget can handle, you do need to account for the principal, since it's FORCED savings.",

            "comment": "&gt;But when presented this scenario in the form of a mortgage, people want to break out the calculators and policy papers.\n\nBecause it's not the same situation. You're not accounting for other factors like the transaction costs of ownership. The landlord isn't asking for tens of thousands up front for this arrangement (closing costs). Nor are they asking for tens of thousands to exit the arrangement (realtor fess). Furthermore, you're not giving them a 0% loan for tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in the form of a 0% loan (down payment).\n\n&gt;And while that's true in the sense that you'll never have to pay extra for it, any landlord worth their salt has factored that, taxes, insurance, and a healthy profit for themselves into whatever your rent payment is.\n\nSorry, but you don't get to give an analogy using numbers, then just hand waive the additional costs that you're not factoring in because the landlord still profits.\n\n&gt;I also think the government incentivizes owning so much\n\nHow? Give me specifics, because I didn't receive any sort of grants from the government to buy my house, nor do I have enough deductions to itemize and gain any tax advantage from ownership. \n\n&gt;But definitely open to any arguments against this.\n\nYour perspective is an oversimplification and the math actually isn't that much more complicated. Generalize both as an investment: You have an upfront investment, monthly contributions, and a final value. Any common things between the two can be ignored with this approach to simplify it.\n\n* Your upfront cost for a mortgage is the down payment and closing costs. For rent, it would be the security deposit. So if we assume the security deposit is less than the down payment and closing costs, you can assume the difference can be invested if you rent.\n* Your monthly contributions for a mortgage are PITI, maintenance and repairs. For rent, it's just the monthly payment. If we assume a rent payment is equal to PITI, then the monthly contributions for rent would just be what you don't pay in maintenance and repairs. For a mortgage it would be nothing.\n* Your final value will be what you're left with when you sell the house/move out of the rental. So for the mortgage, that would be the sale value minus realtor fees and remaining left on the loan. For rent, it would be your investments that you were able to do in lieu of house expenses.",

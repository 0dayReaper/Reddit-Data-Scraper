    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI have been giving considerable thought to purchasing a premium SUV for quite some time now. At present, I am driving a Honda Clarity and have already paid off the car. However, the safety of my toddlers is a major concern, prompting me to seriously contemplate buying a premium SUV. Furthermore, the absence of a second vehicle in our household further reinforces the need for this decision. Despite being financially capable of handling car payments, I am actively trying to resist the allure of acquiring a new vehicle.  \nSince both my spouse and I work from home, we are currently managing well with just one car. On rare occasions when a second vehicle is required, I typically borrow one from a friend. I am curious to hear your thoughts and opinions on this matter.",

But, yes, they offer more room for everything that goes with raising children.\n\nIf you do buy a car, PAY CASH, do not finance, and make sure you have plenty of cash left over to cover all your expenses and extra for emergencies.\n\nIf that means you have to buy used, so be it. If that means you don't buy at all, again, so be it.",

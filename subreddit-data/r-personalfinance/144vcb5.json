    "postText": "Hi everyone, thank you for your help in advance\n\nThis year, I've worked as a W2 employee from Jan 1st to around June 1st. I then switched jobs that pay 1099, and will be working with this job. I know that I have to pay quarterly taxes with 1099, so am I understanding this correctly &gt;&gt; pay quarterly 1099 with 1040-ES form and file it physically, until comes April 2024 then report just W2 on Turbotax? Thank you",

Which generally means you can set your own schedule, chose how you care to do the work, etc  \n\n\nIf you didn't get to do a lot of that, your state labor board may be interested in hearing from you",

    "postText": "We started the remortgage process around six months ago and we agreed a mortgage that has turned out to be about \u00a32000 more than what we owe. We knew we were estimating that figure and erred on the side of caution. \n\nDoes anyone know what happens to the excess? Are we just paid it? Thanks",

            "comment": "You seem to be from the UK so it might be different for you, but in the US this is called a \"cash out refinance\" and yes, you just keep the excess money.  Sometimes people do it as a way to pay down higher interest debts, or to finance a home improvement project.  Or you could just send in the excess as an extra principal payment if you want.",

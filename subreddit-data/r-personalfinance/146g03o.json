    "postText": "This is debt that I\u2019ve accrued pretty much in the last year. I had some personal struggles and needed to move out of state, I finally started a new job but I built up the debt after having not worked for a year and a half. I\u2019m not well versed in the finances area but I have been good at not spending money on what I don\u2019t need. Money is tight right now and the monthly payments kind of hurt being spread out over several cards. What options do I have to help give myself some breathing room?",

This will also require an excellent credit score.\n\nDepending on your income, you may be a candidate for Bankruptcy as well. If you make under $40k a year, it's probably worth considering.",

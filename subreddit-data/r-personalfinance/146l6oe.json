    "postText": "I\u2019ve been stressing these past couple of days on what to do. I have a old 2002 Honda Civic that I bought for $1,500 on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2021. Since then, I\u2019ve put about well over $5k in repairs that includes labor. Now, the transmission needs to be replaced. Which Is minimum $2k. At this point, I might as well have a car payment but at the same time I don\u2019t want one. I listed the car on offer up and Facebook market and the car will only sale for $1,500. I\u2019d hate to basically sell it for nothing. I can definitely afford a car payment but the way the car market is and interest rates, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d go that route. I was going to drive another car my aunt was going to give me but it\u2019s a 2000 mustang gt with about 280k miles and repairs need to be done. \n\nI was thinking about getting this 2019 civic hatchback for $25k with 29k miles and estimated payments would be $400 ish. \n\n26yr male, $60k-70k year (sales job), 780 FICO credit score. $3k CC debt (car repairs). Mom and sister live with me and fianc\u00e9 so I have spending money, no kids.\n\nWhat would you guys do?",

            "comment": "I'd get an assessment on your current car, IE is it in good shape mechanically (except for the transmission).  I think keeping your existing car may be cheaper if the mechanic thinks it will go for a few more years. \n\nRegardless, I'd aggressively pay that credit card off and try to get to a point you have no CC debt.",

That's comparable to the payment you're thinking of, plus the reliability will improve your sanity and your time is worth something.  If the $400 feels high then look for something a few years older.\n\nNo matter what you do you need a trustworthy mechanic.  Have them do a complete inspection on any used car you're thinking of buying, so you at least know what you're getting into.",

Not only would you avoid car payments and interest, your insurance and registration costs should save you several hundred more. And older cars depreciate way slower too.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been able to rationalize this is my head but need neutral people to tell me if it\u2019s stupid. \n\nI\u2019ve been renting (with my spouse) in a HCOL city for over a decade and sick of it. We want to own! But the only housing we\u2019d ever buy would have a monthly payment of about half our take home pay. \n\nI know it sounds bad! But we did the numbers and currently spend 25% or less of our take home every month on all expenses not including housing. So even if we use 50% on housing, we\u2019d still have 25% or more to save. \n\nWe have the down payment, closing costs, and an emergency fund. Housing is our biggest priority in life so is it idiotic to spend half our take-home on it? I know this goes against even the most lax advice.\n\nEDIT: A big thanks to everyone who weighed in. The opinions are much more evenly split than I expected! To those who are suggesting a smaller home further from the city\u2014that IS what we\u2019re looking at. Just the world we live in, I guess!",

Remember, mortgage is the MINIMUM you\u2019ll pay. add in property tax, insurance, inevitable repair costs, fixer upper (making it yours) costs, usually also so expenses related to furnishing (unless you are downsizing from your rental), any utilities that were previously included in your rent...\n\nif they do not, would recommend saving a second HOUSE emergency/slush fund prior to buying.",

Especially for taxation and home improvement costs in HCOL areas where the rates are way higher than the median.\n\nThe first few years of homeownership you need to account for a lot of extra expenses, most of which will be (or really should be) cash.  Stuff that can't wait, either, like the potential need to replace an oil tank or furnace, HVAC, etc.\n\nOP also needs to plan for the increased maintenance costs for equipment.  Are they going to DIY fixes or hire out?  Do they have all the tools they need?  How much are those tools?  Do they need a lawnmower and leaf blower/yard equipment?  Snowblower?  Or will they hire out?  How much does it cost to hire out?\n\nI was out $20k or so in my first year for unexpected things that went wrong in my house.  Before buying, unless you're buying an immaculate luxury property, you absolutely need savings and a budget plan for taxes, insurance, and increased utilities costs (without neighboring apartments acting as a weather buffer, your utilities will be way higher), and THEN an extra few grand for homeowner expenses over the year that may or may not happen.  You absolutely need that extra money to be saved as well if not used, for when major issues happen, such as needing a total roof replacement, major appliance breakdown and damage, emergency weather problems, or the likes.\n\nOwning a house in my experience in an HCOL area is way more expensive than people make it out to be compared to the renting experience.  A lot of the affordable properties need way more work than expected or what comes up in a basic inspection, and you need to be prepared to shell out big dollars to cover those costs.\n\nAt 50% without taxes, insurance, maintenance, or utilities my immediate conclusion is \"you're crazy,\" but that's just been my experience with a house that looked great having as many issues as it's had.",

This was after a tree took out half our fence and our oven stopped heating up. In our first year of home ownership we've easily put 20k into unexpected maintenance. We had to move out of our house temporarily for the repairs too.\n\n\nI don't regret it, but boy am I glad we put the lower down payment so we could keep a sizeable safety net fund. And that we had good insurance. Sure, a lot goes to interest, but phew, this house would have chewed my savings up in a heartbeat if we hadn't factored in exactly this kind of thing.",

Our home is fairly new (about 10 years old) and we have had to replace the HVAC unit, hot water tank, interior fixtures, added a water softener due to extremely poor water quality in the area, and will now need to resod the yard thanks to HOA rules.\n\nIf you are considering buying in a condo/townhouse or single family home in a community with something akin to an HOA, definitely research the governing board's finances to find out how much $$$ they have in reserve funds. It's not unusual for HOAs (or the equivalent) to mismanage funds or not have enough money to pay for unexpected expenses. If that happens, ALL of the owners can be subject to a special assessment to pay for it. (Unfortunately, we know this from firsthand experience...)",

I put every purchase on my credit card. I have never had a credit card bill higher than my mortgage. 30 year mortgages are $3.5k, $4k a month now for starter houses in my area.

You'll just barely meet that criteria at 50% of your take home. Also, remember that your emergency fund now needs to cover the mortgage and all expenses.\n\nIm sorry, this is a bad decision. Unless you're going to have a salary increase soon, you don't have enough coming in to continue to add to your emergency fund, get over tough times, and account for unforeseen costs.\n\nFor example, my company's benefits changed, and now it's an additional $600 a month to cover my family for health insurance. On top of that, our property tax assessment went up 41% since we bought the house. That's roughly an additional $500/mo in mortgage cost. Can you handle an unforeseen monthly increase of $1100?",

            "comment": "&gt;  it idiotic to spend half our take-home on it?\n\nAs a general rule : yes - spending half your take home is not financially prudent.\n\nIt also depends on other factors. Does it come up to 50% because of other financial decisions you've taken?\n\nFor instance : if you're a couple, earning gross 100K per year. Both of you max out your 401K (22.5K each for the year 2023); so you're putting away 45K in the 401K. After taxes and other deductions you have ~40-45K as take home. \n\nIF your housing cost then is 50% (or 20K per year); at that point you need to evaluate the trade off. Reducing your retirement contributions would result in a higher \"take home\"; the trade off is on your retirement. If you've already been maxing your 401K for some years and have a healthy balance there - you may be over-indexing retirement vs current. OTOH - if you're behind - then you would prioritize saving.\n\n\nAnother situation : If you have a monthly take home of 20K; your housing cost at 10K. Still not very prudent, but the point is that having 10K towards other living expenses would be very manageable.\n\n&gt; But we did the numbers and currently spend 25% or less of our take home every month on all expenses not including housing. So even if we use 50% on housing, we\u2019d still have 25% or more to save. \n\nSounds like you MAY be in the second kind of situation. That said, you either need to do your evaluation; or provide more detail (gross income, other expenses, current savings, current level of assets including 401K) for more meaningful evaluation.\n\nWithout those - the fallback would be to say that doing 50% on housing isn't prudent.",

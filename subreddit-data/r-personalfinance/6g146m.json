    "postText": "There's a long list of things you need to worry about when separating from your job regardless of how or why that is happening.  It is often an emotional time, but missing a few key steps could be troublesome down the road.[ ](https://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/leaving-my-job-without-the-going-away-party--aa5a7/)\n\nThis checklist is intended to apply for most situations including: resigning or quitting a job, being fired from a job, or being laid off.  Navigating the end of a contract as a contractor is not really the focus of this post, but some steps may still apply.\n\nSome specifics will only apply to the US (e.g., retirement account types, filing for unemployment, health care).  If you're aware of a guide for any other countries, please make a comment!\n\n## Before resigning *or* if you are at risk of being let go/laid off\n\n- It hopefully goes without saying, but you should already have a firm job offer in hand before resigning (unless you have a different plan like heading back to school).  Likewise, if you are at risk of being let go or laid off, you should be building your network at the very least (if not outright looking for a new position).\n- Do you have a retirement plan with your employer (e.g., 401(k), 403(b), 457, SIMPLE IRA, SEP IRA, or TSP)?\n  - Note that many employers will require to to pay off any outstanding loans you have made against your retirement plan.  If that's the case, you will have only 60 days after separation to pay off the balance to avoid early distribution taxes and penalties.\n  - [Plan out what you'll do with your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement account.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/retirementaccounts/rollovers)\n  - Recognize that you will be giving up any unvested matching for your retirement plan.\n- Have a plan for the first few months after the job.\n  - Figure out what you'll do for health insurance (sign up for your own via COBRA or the ACA, switch to a spouse's plan, or wait to get coverage with new employer).\n  - Consider whether you will want to convert your group life insurance policy to an individual policy.\n  - Make sure you have enough money to carry you into your next job without dipping into your emergency fund, set up a budget, and examine your general financial situation.  Emergency funds are for unexpected circumstances.\n  - If you are planning on moving, understand that landlords often want to see proof of a job and income - which may make getting a new place more difficult.\n- Make copies of any performance reviews, professional certifications, or other personal documents that you'll want to keep as well as your current vacation balance, salary information, etc. Having a copy of your contract and benefit information on a personal computer is also recommended as you might not have access to them in the future.\n- However, do not take copies of any work performed without written approval from management.  This is not your property and is equivalent to stealing.\n- Backup (commonly by emailing a copy to your personal email or copying to a thumb drive) and remove all personal files from your work computer, work phone, and any other device.\n- Be prepared for what you'll do or say if your manager makes a counteroffer.  Many people say it's a bad idea to stay after attempting to resign, but it can also go well.\n- Don't give more than two weeks of notice if leaving immediately and not being paid for your remaining time would be a financial hardship.\n- If you received stock options, received a hiring bonus, or receive ongoing monetary bonuses or RSUs:\n  - Examine your vesting schedule and consider whether you may have to return any bonus money (e.g. hiring bonus, moving stipend, education assistance) before you decide when to quit.\n  - Don't expect to collect options, RSUs, or bonuses during your notice period because you might be terminated immediately. It's better to wait to give notice until after any important vesting dates (you should still give two weeks).\n  - Purchase any stock options that are \"in the money\".\n- Check on your benefits and find out what happens to them upon leaving.\n  - Do you get your outstanding vacation days paid out or do you lose them (meaning you should take them before resigning if possible)?\n  - When does your health/dental/vision insurance expire?  End of the month or day you leave?  Make sure any appointments are scheduled with this in mind.\n  - If you have floating holidays, you may want to take them before resigning.\n  - If you have an FSA, is there anything left in it to spend down (check out FSA eligible items on Amazon). Anything left the day you leave, the company keeps. Even if you are resigning on Jan 15 and only contributed once, you can still spend the entire annual amount and not have to pay it back.\n\n- Put together an email list of anyone you want to email (individually or as a group) when you leave.  Don't email too large of a group because it's tacky and use Bcc: for group emails.\n  - Email should be short and to the point. Something like it was great working with you, I learned a lot.  Here's my personal info to keep in touch.  Don't try to explain yourself.\n\n## How to resign\n\n- Don't burn any bridges and maintain a professional attitude. You never know who you will run into again in the future, keep it professional.\n- Bring a box with you (leave it in your car if you can't bring it in discreetly) to allow for easy packing of any personal possessions in case you are walked out that day.\n- Make sure you have contact information for any key people - coworkers, managers - that you want to keep in contact with or possible use as a reference in the future.  Send a copy of this to your personal email.\n- Do not tell your coworkers/friends prior to telling your boss and HR.  This is not something that you want floating around the office.\n- Tell your manager in person and present a short and professional resignation letter to him or her at this meeting.  When you leave the meeting, email a copy to them and HR (even if it is from home later that day).\n  - Don't make it personal or give a reason.  State the facts.  \"I am resigning POSITION effective DATE.\" You don't owe them a reason (especially in written form), don't try to provide a list of things they could fix, etc.\n  - If you want to elaborate with your manager in person, keep the discussion positive and brief.\n- Give two weeks notice and finish strong, but don't be surprised if you get walked out the day you resign or even immediately after resigning.\n- If you do end up working the notice period - you still need to work!  This is what you will be remembered for, don't start slacking off. Work with your manager to finish or hand off all projects you are currently working.\n- Once you do leave, if something was left behind, make arrangements to pick it up. Talk to HR about this if needed.\n- Send any goodbye email later from a personal email account.  Don't \"spam\" aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people (under 20 people).\n\n## What to do after you are laid off or fired\n\n- Don't burn any bridges and maintain a professional attitude. You never know who you will run into again in the future, keep it professional.\n- Try to keep a calm appearance until you are off property.  This is an emotional time, but you don't want to be remembered as the person who cussed out everyone as they were dragged out by security.\n- Make sure you have contact information for both your manager and HR representative in case of questions later.\n- Try your best to pack any essential personal possessions that day if you get walked out, check for small things like cell phone chargers and pictures. It can be awkward returning later.\n  - If you do need to return for personal items or any other reason, make arrangements in advance, don't just show up and expect to be let back in.\n- You may be asked to sign a legal document giving up certain rights (e.g., a non-compete clause or waiving certain rights to sue) in exchange for severance pay and/or other benefits.  Note that non-compete clauses are very difficult to enforce in some states.  You absolutely need to read the entire document before signing and it's your decision to make.  Consult an attorney if you need help.\n- Send any goodbye emails later from a personal email account.  Don't \"spam\" aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people (under 20 people). Do not send anything right away because your emotions will be running high.\n\n## After leaving\n\n- If you were laid off or fired, [apply for unemployment](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-file-for-unemployment-benefits-online-2064123) as soon as you can assuming [you were not fired for misconduct (i.e., terminated for cause)](https://www.thebalance.com/can-i-collect-unemployment-if-i-am-fired-2064150). The entire process can take weeks so do this as soon as possible.\n- Any life insurance coverage through your employer will terminate after you leave (sometimes immediately, sometimes at the end of the month).  Consider converting your group life insurance policy to an individual policy, especially if others depend on your income or if you have medical conditions that may prevent you from getting an individual policy on your own. The cost tends to be low, but you will only have a limited amount of time to do this (usually 30 days or until the end of the current month, but don't count on that).\n- Move your 401(k) or other employee-sponsored retirement account to your new plan or a Rollover IRA (if that was your plan).\n- Get on LinkedIn and link up with the ex-coworkers who would say good things about you (and vice versa).\n- Get health insurance if needed (see above).  There's a 60-day grace period after leaving your job for COBRA election (you can get coverage retroactively), but signing up for ACA coverage may be less expensive.\n- Make sure you have a plan for how you will sell any company stock.\n- Inform your new employer about how much you've already contributed to your 401(k) for this calendar year to avoid exceeding the contribution limit.  Note that you may have another paycheck or two still coming from your old employer after you quit so it may take a little time to figure this number out.\n\n## Being unemployed\n\nUnless you have a signed job offer in hand, it's time to actually *act* like you are unemployed.\n\n- Hoard cash.  Don't waste money on stuff you don't need to survive.  Review your budget, cut any and all unnecessary expenses, stop eating out and going out to bars for drinks.\n- You have extra time so use it to save money: cook at home, exercise on the cheap, read books from libraries instead of buying them.\n- Your \"job\" is now finding a new job.  \n  - Update your resume (get some feedback on /r/resumes), customize it to each job, and submit it everywhere.  \n  - Spend time every day on job search sites, LinkedIn, and communicating with your network.  Set a weekly goal to send customized applications and resumes to a specific number of jobs per week (e.g., 20 jobs).\n\n----\n\nThanks /u/CripzyChiken for adding information on FSA and a few other things.\n\nP.S.

Many people say it's a bad idea to stay after attempting to resign, but it can also go well.\"\n\nSo much this.  I accepted a job somewhere else and then put in my two weeks.  The next day my boss calls me into his office and asks \"what'll it take to keep you?\".  I blurted out what I thought was a ridiculous number (it was about a 60% raise), really mostly as a bluff, and he said \"let me talk with HR and see what we can do\".  The next day he said the raise was approved, and I ended up working there for another 4 years until I was laid off (probably for being one of the highest paid programmers there) .  \n\nIt made me realize how amazingly underpaid I was before, but gave me a nice boost in pay and has allowed me to get a better deal at future jobs.  \n\nEdit: I should also point out that the place I went after I was laid off was the same place I had previously accepted the offer from and then had to turn around and tell them I couldn't take the position after all.  I made a point to go and tell the person who hired me in person and I think that being professional and apologetic about it really helped with the future hiring (and at $15K more than before), though it was also in a different department.

My understanding is all employment in the US is \"at will\" for both parties, meaning you can quit at any time and you can be let go at any time.  There may be penalties for not working a certain length of time (for example if you were given a signing bonus but then turn around and quit a few weeks later), but again that would all be in contracts.  I don't think I had even signed a proper acceptance letter yet.   \n\nAs far as being ethical, I certainly felt bad about it, but it also wasn't like I planned to get a counter offer I would want to accept (or get one at all).  Basically it was a change in circumstances from when I accepted the job, and I don't regret doing it and think I handled it the most professional and courteous way possible.  I informed them as immediately as I could while still meeting face to face, explained the situation honestly, and expressed my regrets for making them go through the whole process again with more candidates.  \n\nAny reasonable employer knows that people are going to do what is in their best interest, and anyone who doesn't is not being rational about the whole thing.

I had supplemental unemployment from my old company, which meant as long as I was drawing regular unemployment they would supplement it up to my previous full salary, so basically I saw no change in pay after I was laid off and wouldn't for the 18 weeks the supplemental unemployment was good for.  However I had to follow all of the regular unemployment rules: apply for at least one job a week, accept a job if you're offered one, and I had to post my resume on some job site the unemployment office pointed me to.  \n\nWhat ended up happening was some contracting company found my resume and set me up with an interview for a state job (which was a ~40 minute drive away).  I answered honestly in the interview and basically said I wasn't exactly thrilled at the prospect of this job (especially the drive) and it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  They ended up offering it to me anyway despite my obvious reticence, and the DAY they offered it to me I got a call for an interview with the place I actually wanted to work for.  I delayed accepting the state job for as long as I possibly could, but in the end I had to accept it or else lose my unemployment and the supplemental.  I worked that job for all of three weeks before I put in my notice because the much better and closer job was offered to me, which is where I still am.  \n\nAgain, change of circumstances.  I wasn't actively looking for new jobs after accepting the state one, but I was still in the interview process and it ended up working out.  The downside of course was I put in my two weeks and they immediately just let me go, which I fully expected, so I still had two weeks where I was unemployed and got nothing, whereas if they hadn't offered me the state job I could have collected five more weeks of unemployment + supp instead.  And if you think about it since it was a state job I probably overall cost the state more money by wasting everyone's time working there for three weeks (at full pay) than if I had just taken unemployment.   \n\nBasically when looking for a job you should never be out to screw anyone over, but if because of circumstances doing what's best for yourself might end up hurting a company, well that's sometimes the cost of doing business.  Just be professional when these things happen and if they can't be professional about it then you probably made the wise decision. ",

Make sure the money is in your account first. \n\n- 401k or pension vesting schedule.   Don't leave just before you would vest more benefits if you get the choice.  This is typically on a calendar year basis.  \n\nYou may be offered severance, but this is not required unless you have a specific employment agreement.  In some cases, you may be offered severance or other inducement to accept a layoff or resignation in exchange for giving up certain rights, e.g. a noncompete, or waiving the right to sue for discrimination.   You'd have to decide if this is worth it to you.   Note that non-competes are unenforceable in some situations.

Let me explain.\n\nAll you need to do is stop living paycheck to paycheck. Trust me, it's not hard because if you realize that you subconsciously increase spending every time, sometimes before, you get a raise. Once you admit to that, it's easy to regulate self discipline. \n\nHere are simple rules and you never need to worry about making complicated personal financial systems again.\n\n1. Pay your bills 1 month ahead.\n2. Slowly build up cash to at least 6 months worth of expenses in your savings account.\n3. The rest of the money goes into personal investments and retirement funds.\n4. Make sure the investment account and assets can easily be liquidated in case of emergency. This is for everything the 6 month buffer cannot absorb.\n5. Never spend more than you make\n\n\nThat is all you need to do. I review a lot of financial disclosures everyday and it's easy to see the difference between financially savvy and responsible people vs others even though both make the same amount of money. \n\nIf you just follow these simple rules, you'll never run into a problem even if you suddenly lost your job or landed your dream job but you need to move cross country. Even if the economy takes a dive and you got laid off, you'll still be fine for a year with your buffer and unemployment checks. Even if you hate your job and just want to resign before having another job, you can. \n\nKeep it simple and stress free. ",

That's rude, and it's ridiculous. Why should it be any different when I take a vacation? This is how I choose to budget my money. I happen to prefer going on vacation to buying a car.

For me, when we talking about emergency funds, I'm really talking about a financial emergency fund.  \n\nSo, a flat tire may be an emergency, but not necessarily a financial emergency.  It is an expense.  A surprise expense, but still an expense.  When they happen, I make every effort to adjust my budget to cover that expense.  \n\nIf I can't adjust my budget in a way that covers the expense without major sacrifice, I now know two things.  One, I have a financial emergency and I will need to draw from the e-fund.  Two, my budget is not flexible enough to handle my life's surprise expenses.  I may need to consider changes to make sure I have enough flexibility in the future.\n\nObviously, some events are too extraordinary to overcome even with proper planning.",

If you use it, you are now less safe.\n\nIf you are suddenly fired, it will be hard to avoid using it.  Your budget will drop to 0 and you will quickly need to replace the income that you were relying on.  In the interest of 'not using it', you should also immediately seek more employment to avoid using it more.\n\nIf you know you are going to be unemployed, you should be preparing for it.  I don't think someone should rationalize not preparing for it by thinking that they will just ride the e-fund.  The e-fund should only kick in if the preparations turn out to be insufficient in the end.",

I imagine it's just best to save that fund for as long as possible, but if you end up fired and unemployed for a long enough period, then yes, that's what the emergency fund is for.  Ideally it's for things like your car just exploded or you have to make a sudden trip across country for family or something",

Why are we keeping this emergency fund around if we are not going to use it to cover unexpected circumstances?\n\nbecause accidents, injuries, any other random sort of thing can happen while you are also unemployed.  So now the money that would help cover rent for three months, turned into rent for a month and a half because:\n\n- car suddenly needed tires (this just happened to me, had to replace two of my tires...)\n- you/spouse/kids got injured and it was a costly doctors visit\n- you pet got sick and the vet charged you a ton for the medicine\n- you know, random things. \n\n\nso having a fund, separate from your emergency one, to help you cover your expenses while being unemployed is critical for **some** people, more so to those with families.

Having two incomes even for a short amount of time can help pay off important debts or buffer savings.\n\nFinally, one disagreement - depending on the amount left on your 401K loan, it may not be a better idea to pay it off.  If you're running lean, take the 20 or 30% hit in taxes instead to make sure you're ok for the short term.",

In addition to what others have said, Some other things to consider:\n\nCalculate roughly how many months you can stay unemployed without having to make major changes, like sell the house, or withdraw money from retirement savings. \n\nIf you have a mortgage, look into forbearance. \n\nFile for unemployment, if laid off.  It won't be enough to support you, but it will be enough to stretch how long you can avoid the major changes. \n\nConsider applying for a home equity line of credit (if applicable) before you quit.  Hopefully you won't need it, but you are unlikely to get it without a job. \n\nWhile certainly not ideal, Roth IRAs can be cashed out without the tax penalty. \n\nDon't pay off all your credit balances, if you have some. Save your cash, pay the minimums. If things get dire, talk forbearance with them. If it comes down to paying for the house or the credit cards, pay the house.  I know someone who religiously paid their credit cards, but lost their house.  Don't do that. \n\nSell stuff.

I realize that most people my age or generation tend to job hop more then me, but I felt a deep connection with what I did, and enjoyed helping others and working towards my goals.  \n\nI won't mention where I worked but it was one of the biggest tourists attractions in the state (not Disney or anything like that) but we are a multi million dollar company and it was quite something to learn the business side of things. My company was bought out towards the end of my stay there, and unfortunately all changes that were made had a negative impact on the majority that were involved. \n\nIt seems like this list is more tailored towards white collared workers, but I'll give a few of my tips for either:\n\n- I personally don't feel that it's a negative connection in the workforce to be associated with one job for a set length of time over a few years. I've heard people turn their heads at the idea but even though I only had one career on my resume, it was outstanding from working so hard there, won awards, etc. I feel that you can absolutely succeed if you have just had one or two long term jobs over the course of your life, just make the most of them. \n\n- If you have the money to afford a better education or get a degree, always pursue that, but if you can't afford it like me, don't let it make you feel like you can't actually climb the ladder anywhere or succeed. I had nothing coming out of high school and managed to get pretty high with my company, all from hard work, a  positive outlook on learning from others and team work. I feel there are always ways around not having enough funds to go to school. \n\n- Seeking unemployment temporary is certainly the best idea and smartest, but I'm not sure it works for everyone and I would not count on it. After all of us were laid off from where we were, I filed for it with the best intentions in my state, and they still turned me down (along with other employees I worked with, that had over 20, 30 years of experience). I guess it all depends on a number of factors, but I would be cautious on relying with that. \n\nAnyway that's my thoughts on the matter, not sure if this will get deleted because I don't use Reddit often and if it's against the rules or something, but hopefully this is helpful to someone.

Had two interviews. Everything fell through. Went on a type of walkabout to think what in the hell I was going to do. Get a call in the middle of my journey \"Hey we need a last minute replacemnt, can you come in next week and sign a one year contract\". That was it. I didn't even apply there. Ended up working 3 years there. Now my contract is up in March of 2018 and I am already job hunting. At least I have 8 months to look instead of 3 like last time (the hiring season for my job is April, very rarely do they hire outside of starting in April) ",

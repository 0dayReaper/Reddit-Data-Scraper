    "postText": "**Important Background:**\n\nI'm 26F and I started a new job 3 months ago. It's a state government job that pays $19.50/an hour with raises every 2-3 years. I plan on staying long-term and everyone at work is aware of my intentions. This job has an annual period where the schedule changes from 8hr shifts, 5 days a week (M-F), to 12hr shifts, 4 days on 2 days off. 3 blocks of day shift then 3 blocks of night shift cycling through until the period is over. Day shift gets 4hrs of overtime and night shift obviously gets 12hrs. So I will be making a decent amount of money. \n\nThere are two major purchases I want to make in the next 5 years *(hopefully).* A car and property. I currently rent from my mom *(she doesn't live here, it's just me)* for $500/month. It's not a very stable situation and isn't great for my mental health. My goal is to buy acreage and put a trailer on it and spend the next several years saving to build a house. \n\nI also don't *need* a car. I can walk to work it's so close. I have an '80s pickup that isn't super reliable but gets me where I need to go. However it's tough on gas and gas prices make it a luxury. And I own 2 motorcycles which I've been riding over to work. The only trip I need to take is to the grocery store 30 minutes away. My parents really want me to get a car as well.\n\n**The car:**\n\nThe car goal is more short-term compared to the property. I'd like to buy a car next spring. I want to take time to build credit history and have several months of great credit. I'd also like to go through SECU if I can. I'm planning on putting minimum $5k down.\n\nI want a Honda Civic no matter what. I learned to drive in a Honda CR-Z and ever since I've been a complete Honda fanatic. My mom traded that in for a 2016 Honda Civic and I completely fell in love with that car. So this is where I'm stuck. \n\nThe car I really want is a 2016-2021 Honda Civic. I think they look amazing inside and out *(not a fan of the 2022 redesign)*. But they average closer to $15k for one that's under 120k miles. Some part of me feels like an idiot for spending so much on a car when I don't own property/have a stable living situation. That's halfway to a down payment. I rent for $500/month and if something happened I'd have to move and likely pay ~$1,400/month somewhere else. \n\nOn the other hand, used cars aren't cheap. It doesn't seem possible to get a halfway decent car for near $5k anymore. I feel like if I'm spending more than $7k-$8k that's a huge amount of money and I might as well go all in and get the car I actually want. If I got anything other than the '16-'21 Civic I want then I'd be settling and that seems like a lot of money just to settle. \n\nAnother option is to get a car for under $5k but I feel like that doesn't get you what it could anymore. After doing repairs to my truck the reality hit that all cars need a lot of repairs. Things just age and need to be replaced after a while. That makes me nervous buying a 2007-2010 car *(the ones that are $7k-$8k)* because the whole point of the car is that it's supposed to be reliable and in well enough condition to save money on gas.\n\nI've been stressing myself out going in circles thinking about this",

There\u2019s nothing the matter with buying things that you want, I\u2019m all for a little splurge occasionally, but I try to ask myself if it\u2019s a need or a want. \n\nIf you were to start saving for a downpayment for property, maybe you could save up your $15K towards that and then decide if you wanted a car or property?\n\nAnother thing to consider is that cars are typically going to be depreciating assets, whereas property will typically appreciate",

You should just put this whole dilemma on the backburner and reassess when it's actually time to buy it. There is a very good chance those 16-21 civics that you want will depreciate by a few grand between now and next spring. Or maybe people will stop getting away with selling their 200k mile shitboxes for 5k.",

The reason for that is inflation--not just the most recent spate of high-inflation, which is abnormal, but target inflation.   \n\nThe fed tries to have inflation of 2% annually to stimulate growth.  If you're seeing a wage increase of 2-3 percent every few years, you'll be in the red, even with periodic wage increases because inflation will outpace your earnings.",

    "postText": "Good afternoon y\u2019all. I will lay out my situation and I would just like your opinion on it. I will be blunt and not beat around the bush. Also, wall of text ensuing: \n\nI\u2019m early 30\u2019s, always been lower income. Never had enough money, I\u2019ve lived paycheck to paycheck for 13 years now. Have a kid, never married her mom. Not much family, my biological parents passed when I was pretty young. Cousin and husband take me in. Cousin passed, then very recently her husband passed. He left me his house and all of his possessions in his will. I\u2019m receiving around 800k. Now 200k goes to my kid so they can go to college or receive a payout every year for 4 years. 4 Roth IRAs in thrivent. We are moving them to Edward Jones. \n\nWhat would you do?",

After that it depends on you a lot. Is the house included in the 800k? Consider either keeping the paid off house and live for free, or use the proceeds to buy a modest house. The rest of the money can go into a taxable brokerage. Very kind to save the 200k for your kid - you could consider a 529. The biggest gift to give a kid is not making them pay for your retirement, so make sure you are on track there too.",

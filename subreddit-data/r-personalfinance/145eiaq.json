    "postText": "Dear all,\n\nI am in a bit of a pickle and wanted your advice. TLDR:\n\n1. I owe taxes to IRS and the amount was slightly higher so I opted for payment plan\n2. My tax guy said payment plan wont incur any interest or penalty and i trusted him but looks like it does\n\nNow I want to cancel my payment plan and pay in full but there is no option online.\n\nThere is an option for one time payment or modify my payment plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion - If I do a one time payment now and pay off the amount, will the payment plan for monthly installment still kick in tomorrow (let us assume tomorrow is the due date) or the IRS payment plan stops once you pay what you owe?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA for your help\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\* - For the benefit of everyone here, I am posting the resolution, after talking to the agent (after a hold of 2 hours) - So it is no where mentioned in the IRS site, but once you pay off your amount due, your payment plan gets cancelled automatically. So do not worry about not having an option of cancelling the plan online, it gets auto-cancelled when the payment is done in full (it is the logical answer, but since it was not mentioned in the site, I wanted to make sure).",

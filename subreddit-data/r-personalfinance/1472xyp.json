    "postText": "One of acquaintances, had started a new (out of college) in 2022 with with 'Company A' which was partially purchased by 'Company B' during 2022. They received W2 from Company B and filed taxes (thru turbotax) with IRS assuming that all incomes were included in Company B W2. IRS sent a letter recently showing a shortfall of income reported thus additional tax + penalty + interest.\n\nWhat need to be done to file an amended tax return. Is there any way to reduce/waive penalty.\n\nWhat are other suggestions for this situation.  \n\nif requesting abatement/pardon, what should be included. Thanks",

You can call and request a First Time Penalty Abatement if you have had no issues in the past and are in compliance.  Interest on the tax due, by law, must be charged and cannot be removed (though any interest assessed on a Penalty that is abated will be removed).\n\nIf you disagree with the proposed changes, follow the instructions in the letter. This will basically say to send a written explanation on why you disagree, as well as supporting documents,  to the address on the letter.\n\nIn addition, you must reply by the response date, or you can miss out on important appeal rights.",

    "postText": "Man, f*ck an HOA\n\nI purchased this 2/2.5 townhome in South FL back in 2021 for $250k at 2.9%.  Other exact units are selling for $320k to $340k.  Current HOA is $420/mo and will only continue to go up.  \n\nYesterday, we received a letter regarding a special assessment that covers several projects.  This includes new roofs on all buildings (35 buildings, 8-12 units per building), facility upgrades, etc.  community was built in 2006- was it built poorly?  \n\nThe special assessment is for a total of about $5,000,000\n\nFor my unit, I am expected to cough up almost $20k.\n\nWe have not found out further details regarding if the HOA expects a lump sum payment, a payment plan, or when they even expect it.  There is a meeting in a few weeks on the matter.\n\nMy concern is this- I don\u2019t have $20k to cough up and I don\u2019t expect to have $20k readily available anytime soon or even within 8-12 months.  I\u2019ve just been shafted by unexpected payments in 2023.  \n\nAdditionally, the housing market in South FL is horrendous.  So, purchasing a new home isn\u2019t really practical as I will most likely be paying more for a lesser quality home, in a lower quality area, with possible repairs/issues, and the area would be borderline dangerous.  I won\u2019t move into another HOA-ridden community.  \n\nAlso, I commute M-F to work and I just don\u2019t see any ability to move any closer to work in any way (too expensive).\n\nI\u2019m just not really sure what to do here.  I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m just going to have to take out a personal loan and pay the $20k.  Or just pay their payment plan if the HOA offers one.  I really like the home, neighborhood, and city.  It\u2019s my home town and my parents live 5-10 minutes away.  \n\nJust making this post to see if anyone has dealt with something similar or has some guidance that I haven\u2019t considered.  Also, need to vent a little as I don\u2019t appreciate being told I need to cough up $20k.\n\nThanks for any input!",

And associations are required to have larger percentage of money set aside for major repairs by the year 2024. Some associations are staying silent and will drop the bomb on residents in 2024. Others are trying to nip in the bud early (like yours). Google this topic on YouTube\n\np.s. a 10 year old roof in Florida means most insurers won't underwrite.\n\nEdit it's 2025 not 2024.

I'd be curious if the home inspection mentioned the condition of the roofs which could have been a warning sign to look elsewhere.\n\nI was fortunate that my realtor got me a copy of the HOA bylaws and financials before I signed the contract so I was able to see that their rules were minimal, reserves were solid and the expenses were reasonable.  Plus we're also all single family homes so my roof is my problem and the neighbor's roof is his problem.  Unless I was more affluent or could buy new construction I'd hate to live in any kind of attached home for the reasons you're experiencing now.\n\nAnyway, my advice still stands, take out a HELOC to pay the special assessment and pay it off as fast or slow as works for you. Good luck!",

The tricky part, because we did a special assessment recently (for much less) is there multiple people tried to say they would sell the house, but the HOA needs to provide the docs to complete the sale. So you\u2019ll unlikely (depending how the docs are written) be able to sell to get past the 20k, as it would either come from the sale, or out of pocket. It would not be passed onto the next owner.",

They will either break it into several payments (such as over six to twelve months) OR the HOA will take out a bank loan and let owners make monthly payments on their portion of the loan over say, five or ten years or whatever term the loan to the HOA is for. \n\nOnce it\u2019s voted upon, you can look at what they have set up, see if their payment plan works for you, or if you\u2019d rather take out a home equity loan and pay the HOA in one lump sum, and pay back the home equity loan over a time period that works for you and your bank. Depending on each loan\u2019s rates and payment times, one or the other may work better for you.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, much of this is new laws, new inspections, and new insurance requirements. The HOA may not have much choice in the matter for new roofs, hurricane level wind resistant windows, or whatever the insurance company demands.\n\nKeep in mind, often the best time to upgrade common areas is to roll it into other more needed renovations for the best price with the contractors and one big loan. Improved common areas increases the value of your unit. If assessments and payments are high, buyers are going to want some nice amenities with those high fees. A buyer might say, what are we getting for $X a month HOA fees? Not just a building that functions, I hope. We want a modern gym and pool for that price.\u201d",

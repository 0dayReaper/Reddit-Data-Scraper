    "postText": "I just moved my wife\u2019s 401k from principal to Wealthfront using a manual 60 day rollover (as an in-line conversion wasn\u2019t possible). But I messed up and made the deposit short by 75 cents. WF has a minimum transaction of $1, so I can\u2019t do a second transaction to get it exactly right, I would be over by 25 cents. \n\nWhich one is worse? Or is neither a big deal?",

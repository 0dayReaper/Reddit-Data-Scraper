Or just keep it in the bank while I'm still studying? \n\nCurrently struggling with scarcity mindset as I'm constantly fearing that I will lose money if I spend some of it. \ud83d\ude05\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "Usually when you are younger you can invest more aggressively and as you get closer to retirement you become more conservative with your investments. That being said, it can also change based on personal preferences, I would just diversify your investment, which it would include to keep some in the bank. Maybe talking with a personal advisor would help you decide on what to do.",

            "comment": "So you will \u201close money if you spend some of it.\u201d  That is what spending is - but you aren\u2019t talking about spending, you are talking about saving or investing.\n\nNow the question is what purpose this money has in your life.  Do you have foreseeable needs for it in a relatively short time period?  If so, then a high  yield savings account or CD is where your money probably needs to go.\n\nIf there are no foreseeable demands on this money, then get most of it invested into a broad mutual fund or ETF and move along with life.  Given that you are indicating a amount of over $100k, I would assume that this is the way to go for you.  Hold back a portion in a HYSA or a couple of shorter term CDs to account for potential spending in the near term.\n\nKudos for accumulating such a large amount at a young age!",

MSFT pays a measley dividend but it probably made the biggest AI move of anyone not named NVIDIA.",

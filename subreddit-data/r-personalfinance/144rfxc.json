    "postText": "Can Capital Lossed be deducted from existing Tax debt? \n\nIn the year 2021 i racked up $20k in Tax debt due to Capital Gains, so far I paid off $8k and left with a $12k balance. but in the year 2022 I ended with $4k in capital Losses. I'm aware you can only claim $3k a year, but my question is... can those $3k be applied against my current $12k debt balance?",

If you apply capital loss to you INCOME then yes its just a deduction but if you apply it to capital gains from anither investment then its dollar for dollar and there is no limit. $20k in capital loss would negate $20k in capital gain.",

Deducting a $20K capital loss from a $20K long term capital gain means you don\u2019t pay capital gains tax on $20K (taxes of $3K (15%) for most people or $4K (20%) at most), not that you save $20K.\n\nIt\u2019s still just a deduction, regardless of whether it\u2019s a deduction on capital gains or income.\n\nThe reason that the income deduction is limited on an annual basis is because it\u2019s almost always a higher percentage savings than LTCG tax.",

Say that\u2019s 24%, which is typical for many people.  You save 24% of $3K.  $720.  You can only do this if you have no capital gains to offset.\n\nIf you offset $3K in long term capital gains, that\u2019s at your long term capital gains tax rate.  That\u2019s 15% for most everyone.  So $450.\n\nYou are required to offset capital gains first because the deduction isn\u2019t as good.   When you can deduct from\nIncome, you save way more, which is why it\u2019s limited.",

Okay I was thinking of capital gains as the amount of money you gained, not the tax you pay.  So $3k of losses offsets $3k of gains.  But in the same way $3k of losses offsets $3k of income.  But the TAX savings is less, for cap gains 15% for income your marginal rate.  And yes applies to Cap gains first.  Yup, totally clear what you were saying now we both are saying the same thing just miscommunicating.",

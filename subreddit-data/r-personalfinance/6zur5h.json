    "postText": "I'm not sure where to post this, but noticed something had changed on the TransUnion website about freezing credit this morning when I was giving links to family so they could freeze theirs. \n\nI froze my credit the day after news about the Equifax breach broke, and it looks like TransUnion has since changed their site to push people away from freezing their credit in favor for their own product called TrueIdentity (like what Equifax was doing with their TrustedID Premier.)\n\n\nThe FTC website links to [this page](http://www.transunion.com/freeze) for freezing your credit with TransUnion.\n\n\n[This is what the website looked before the changes were made on 9/11.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170729070041/https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) The instructions on placing a credit freeze were clear and there was no mention of their own TrueIdentity product.\n\n\nIf you want to place a credit freeze with TransUnion now:\n\n* You have to get through a page of info about credit and fraud, and then the action it tells you to take is to \"Lock your credit information by enrolling in TrueIdentity.\"\n* The option to freeze your credit is under \"About credit freeze\", deliberately passive in their use of language\n* The description about credit freezing is dissuasive: \"A credit freeze may be available under your state law\"\n* The link for the credit freeze is also a passive \"click here\" compared with \"by enrolling in TrueIdentity\" language used for the link to their own product.\n* Clicking the link to learn more about credit freeze brings you to [yet another page](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze2) that tries to convince you to enroll in their product over placing a credit freeze\n* After searching through their page of BS, you finally get to the [link to freeze your credit](https://freeze.transunion.com).\n\n\nThis is such a blatant attempt by TransUnion to take advantage of the Equifax breach for their own financial gain. It's a shitty thing for TransUnion to do, and people should be aware that they are being led away from putting an actual credit freeze on their account.\n\n(Edited for formatting on mobile)",

I didn't realize it's a credit agency prerequisite to be willing to exploit millions of people in their time of need.\n\n**Forget the website, just call the TransUnion Freeze hotline 888-909-8872**\n\n*Edit: since this blew up*\n\nIf you can't get through try calling at a weird time when the volume might be low. E.g., 12:30AM\n\n\nHere are the other two credit union freeze hotlines:\n\n**Equifax: 1-800-685-1111 (NY residents 1-800-349-9960 and for you Canadians 1-800-465-7166)**\n\n**Experian: 1 888 397 3742**\n\nWhile you're at it you might as well opt out of promotional solicitations from credit unions too www.optoutprescreen.com.\n\n(Also, thanks for popping my golden cherry, stranger)\n ",

And, we need to give people the tools and access to monitor their credit continuously and transparently.\n\nIt is at this point safe to assume that NO adult in America has a secure/private social security number or other personal identifier. Therefore, none of us is safe from identity theft/fraud - this was already true probably, but now it's open and obvious.\n\nAt a minimum, credit information should be continuously available to consumers, for free. At least in that case, you can choose to monitor your credit regularly the same way many people monitor their bank account and credit card statements regularly. Then, you can identify any potential fraud IMMEDIATELY so that you can more rapidly gather evidence to support your claims of fraud. In simple terms, I should be able to know SAME DAY if a credit card application is filed in my name, such that I can raise the dispute immediately if it is fraudulent before the damage is done. As it stands, I can only check on that what, once a year? How am I supposed to prove that I didn't open an account and spend a shit ton of money 11 months ago? \n\nThis might make a good /r/changemyview post, but I don't see any good reason why credit information should not be continuously available for free to each person.

Blackmailing with browser history or compromising pictures pale in comparison to what the credit bureaus are now doing. Even the Mob doesn\u2019t have it this easy.  Consumers had better play-along \u2018or else\u2019 their ability to participate in modern society will be crippled.\n\nEquifax stands to make a lot of money selling monitoring for information they failed to protect. Charging 5-15 dollars to lock accounts will net them up to 3.0 billion dollars. Equifax also charges to unlock and lock it again. If consumers are willing to sign all their rights away Equifax will give consumers a year of security monitoring with no promise to fix your credit if it is impacted. If you actually want protection it\u2019s $16.95 a month. That's a potential of billions of dollars a month to protect something collected without your direct permission and then lost. This seems so close to blackmail it is mind boggling. On Equifax's word; you could be prevented from getting a job, having credit cards, buying a house or car.  One-hundred fifty million people are now completely exposed moving forward everyone will require credit monitoring which really is just the credit bureau's expanding their reach into consumers pockets.  \n\nEven worse Credit monitoring isn\u2019t a guarantee of anything. Most products only promise to tell you you have been compromised you still have to go through the pain and fixing it with the small hope you can fight them to have expenses reimbursed. At least the Mob offers some actual protection from your shop being burnt down or robbed, credit monitoring doesn\u2019t even do that. Although, you will get a text on your phone at some point after the fire begins.\n\nMeanwhile, Equifax will go from a measly gross profit of 3.1 billion last year to the potential of 2-5 billion a month.  How could they resist not leaking your information for returns like that? Congrats Equifax you just turned credit monitoring into a massive growth industry and all it took was gross negligence. And Just like the Mob they didn\u2019t burn your shop down they just can\u2019t stop it, unless of course, you pay $16.95 a month.\n",

No crime is getting solved, no one's going to jail, and there is, in most cases, absolutely nothing we can do to help the situation except give you a pamphlet redirecting you back to the same credit bureaus that got you into this mess. It's insanity. You're not freezing your credit for fun, you're doing it because something is seriously wrong. That should be the end of the conversation with them. But I digress.",

Had a situation similar to yours where the customer's credit had an active fraud alert on it. Called the # and left a message.\n\nThe credit manager for the territory wanted to ignore it and move forward. I got a call back from the fraud alert and they confirmed the did NOT want the purchase. They wanted to know who was doing this as it wasn't the first time and she had been fighting identity theft for a LONG time.\n\nThe manager wanted me to hung up on her and walk away from it. He was worried that sharing info about the applicant would be a violation of consumer privacy and that we'd be liable. I ignored him and, while I gave her no information about the dealership or any of the personal information from the application, I did advise what city and state I was working under - which was far from where she was. I advised that given who I was calling from and how many dealers would do business with us that it would narrow down her search. Essentially left only 1 dealership even a possibility.\n\nFast forward a month ahead and found out from the car dealer that not only did I help stop a fraudulent transaction, but the identity thief got caught and was arrested and was presumably pending trial for ID theft and with real jail time possibility.\n\nNot a decision I look back on with regret.\n\nSorry you got hit as well. The situation I was involved in happened just a few years before yours but the time frame matched up with the tail end of my career with that employer and made me recall the story.\n\nTL;DR - Worked as a low level grunt at an auto lender and had the stones to do the right thing and help the consumer get an ID thief  caught rather than turn a blind eye and let the thief walk away.",

For the 1% of the time when you do need your credit to be available it's easy enough to lift the freeze.\n\nNow that most Americans' SSNs are leaked to the black market it's more likely that an identity thief will try to open credit in your name. If your credit is frozen when they try then they fail. Keeping your credit frozen 99% of the time means that they'll fail 99% of the time.\n\nI like those odds. ",

It all seems rather fishy that someone can make money simply by telling other people whether or not you pay your bills. They are holding rents on your ability to make regular payments. But really, shouldn't like, your credit card company, or your landlord, or whoever actually be able to do this, for free?",

You'd have thousands of \"yes\" or \"no\" answers to that question from every single institution that you've ever done business with if there wasn't a centralized system in place making actually getting anything you'd need credit for a horrible hassle and require massive down payments like you had a 500 score now. The problem comes in because money is involved, and money makes everything a hassle because everyone wants to make a profit.\n\nAs the age old \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\" continues to hold true, these companies have so much power over us that they take advantage of that to be as horrible as possible and know we have no other choice but to just deal with it. That's what makes this whole situation so bad. If they were properly regulated and had actual standards they had to follow we wouldn't be in this mess. Instead they were allowed to run this however they wanted and as more and more comes out it becomes increasingly clear that letting the fox run the hen house is, as usual, never a good option. Either these companies need to have a bunch of regulations and standards quickly dropped onto their heads that they are now required to follow or they need to be dissolved and we have a new company that has proper regulations and standards put into place to avoid this type of \"haha, people's info was compromised. Let's just make even more money off them.\"",

The phone systems require quick responses to or the systems fail out quickly, but this is relatively quick and probably easier than their website that tries to re-direct you.  Here are the phone entries you will make for each freeze that you can place to guide you through the phone menu of each of the credit reporting agencies:\n\nTransunion 888-909-8872:\n\n    enter zip code\n    press 3 to add freeze\n    enter social security number\n    enter date-of-birth as 8 digits MMDDYYYY\n    enter house number from street address then # key\n    choose a 6 digit security code\n    credit card number for $10 charge\n    4 digit expiration date of credit card MMYY\n\nEquifax 800-685-1111:\n\n    press 3 to select freezes\n    press 1 to continue\n    say your state then 1 to confirm\n    enter social security number then 1 to confirm\n    enter house number from street address then # key, then 1 to confirm\n    press 1 to select a freeze\n    there will be a long pause at this point but when the bot comes back it goes very fast. \n        Write down the 10-digit pin provided XXXXXXXXXX then later, \n        Write down the 10-digit confirmation number provided XXXXXXXXX. \n        Press * to repeat both until you have it correct\n\nExperian 888 397 3742\n\n    press 2 for freeze\n    press 2 for freeze\n    press 1 for add freeze\n    press 2 for no fraud report\n    enter social security number then # key then 1 to confirm\n    enter date-of-birth as 8 digits MMDDYYYY then 1 to confirm\n    enter zip code then # key\n    enter house number from street address then # key\n    press 2 for not blind\n    press 1 to pay by credit card\n    wait through list of charges by state\n    select credit card type 1 for mastercard, 2 for visa, 3 for american express, 4 for discover\n    enter credit card #, then 1 to confirm\n    4 digit expiration date of credit card then # key MMYY#\n\n",

    "postText": "Looking for opinions on whether outside a spreadsheet it makes sense to take a marginal loss in interest rates on an auto loan to holding cash vs. paying outright. \n\nTypically when purchasing vehicles in the past I've paid outright since I would prefer to avoid interest, payments, etc. Generally nice to keep the cash flow open and save a dollar if you can. Typically I've spent $30K or so on past cars but am going through with a $60K car this time around. \n\nConceptually the same but the amount hits a little different. I could write a check but part of me says there is some benefit to securing that in a money market at 4-4.25% and taking out an auto-loan at 5.75%. On paper its \"losing\" but its incremental and feel emotionally there is some teeter-totter where holding the cash in-hand still provides me added financial power. Thoughts? \n\nWhile cars obviously depreciate I was messing around with making the down-payment equal to my anticipated depreciation + taxes/DMV and marginal interest loss. Effectively only locking up my sunk cost vs. the asset. \n\nAm I crazy or should I just pay for it and be done?",

However, my auto loan APR were never higher than my HYSA APY.\n\nRemember that the interest you earn from your money market is subject to income tax so it's not really a difference of 5.75% - 4-4.25%. In this current environment, if I had to buy a car, I'd still finance (likely with a manufacturer incentive rate), but as soon as rates dropped, I would refinance ASAP.",

None of this would be impacting retirement savings, securities with tax implications or a rainy day fund that would support our livelihood for 6-8 months if we were both simultaneously unemployed. \n\nOnly debt is our mortgage. But wild card is flash forward a year or 2 we want to do some home projects. So would probably earmark the cash savings for that. So there is probably some projection into that cost and a potential HELPC rate vs. the auto rate to offset the difference today",

Thoughts?\n\nYou're paying a \"liquidity penalty\" - essentially paying an opportunity cost to keep your cash liquid (in money market) as opposed to illiquid (in the form of a difficult-to-transact car).\n\nOver many years, this could erode up to - just throwing numbers out here - roughly 2% of that 60k per year, or about 10k over the life of the loan.",

Gives you options month to month with minimal erosion.\n\nYou can take a loan while keeping cash available, and you're paying an arbitrage penalty. Downside is you pay more interest than you need. Upshot is you have liquidity.\n\nYou are placing a value on having that liquidity- in this case, roughly 2% of the outstanding balance per year.",

This is good advice and helps wrap my hands around the feeling/power of having cash now but wanting to avoid the arbitrage without as much potential penalty of wanting liquidity. \n\nI mean, paying cash the worst possible thing that could happen is I need to sell or downgrade cars if I hit dire straights. At least I didn't pay incremental interest in the process.",

    "postText": "I'm using a throwaway as my main is easily connected to me.\n\nMy husband and I made the decision that in the next year we are going to move closer to my home state and purchase our first house. Just for some financial background, we don't have much in terms of liquid savings. I have a brokerage account with around $70,000 that I'd rather not touch, we have 401k but combined I think we're only around $50,000 (we both had jobs for a few years that didn't offer 401k), and I have a trust fund where I receive a certain amount monthly, and I get a lump sum when I turn a certain age, which I'm about 5 years away from. I can pull from that trust early for certain reasons, one of them being to buy a house. I currently have about $500,000 in there, and it gets added to every year that my grandparents are alive (I believe \\~$35k per year). They are currently not in the best health, but not in the worst either. I have great credit. My husband has okay credit, not great, but is improving.\n\nWe're looking at houses in the $200k-$350k range. I am wanting to pull from my trust to pay the down payment. But if we find a house with a great price, closer to $200k, would it be absolutely crazy to pay in cash with the trust money? And use the money we would pay in rent/mortgage to contribute more towards 401k/savings?  Because right now, that trust is what I'm relying on to retire. So, on the one hand, it makes me nervous to use up that much of it, but on the other hand, with the money we would be paying towards a mortgage, we could easily start saving and building a more liquid savings, which is important to me.\n\nWhat about if we put down a larger than average down payment instead? Less crazy? More crazy? We're in very very early stages, as in just recently made the decision that this is what we want to do and haven't gotten into the nitty gritty of what it really means to buy a house yet.\n\nAlso, will I need to pay taxes on pulling from the trust? I'm woefully uninformed about this trust, I just know that it exists, there are some restrictions (which for purposes of this post I'm not taking into consideration) and an approximate amount, but I plan on having a conversation with my aunt (who handles the trusts) soon.\n\nI'm sorry if these are stupid questions, I'm really trying to learn more about my finances and become more financially savvy. Thank you.\n\nEdit: To answer a couple of questions, \n\n\\- my husband and I have a prenup that protects my trust and protects the house if I use money from the trust to purchase it. \n\n\\-I currently make $70k and that won't change. My husband currently makes about $55k, and that should go up to maybe around $65k-$70k when we move. I don't believe he should have a problem finding a job in the new area because he works an in-demand trade.",

If left in the trust and the way it is written, it may specifically be written to you and only you as the beneficiary.  Meaning your husband will not have any entitlements to it.\n\nHowever, once that money is pulled from the trust and you and your husband purchase a house together.  That house may become a common shared property between you and your husband.\n\nIn the chance, something bad happens and you two divorce; the house can be contested.  Whereas money left in a trust cannot.",

I just wanted to talk to my husband before laying this out as an option here. I don't think he'd mind, we'd just need to figure out what that would look like if I didn't pay in cash and there was a mortgage. I know that can be a sticky situation and there are a lot of people out there who believe it's not right to pay into someone else's mortgage if they're not on the deed. So we'd have to work something out, whether it be a \"rent\" payment, or he just handles the utilities while I handle the mortgage, etc. I'm not super worried about this conversation as we had plenty of in-depth conversations when working on the prenup about what home ownership would look like.",

What if something goes wrong and you need to replace a big ticket item 6-12 months down the road in the house? Will you be forced to pull from the trust, or will your income be enough to figure it out. The trust is a fantastic start, and you\u2019re blessed more than the average person, but that 500k will evaporate quickly if you guys don\u2019t have the income to support the home purchase.",

But he will likely make more up there, probably closer to $65k but of course that isn't a guarantee. \n\nThere's a shortage of his trade in the area we're moving to and as far as I am able to tell right now (will have to do more research) he won't need a license there to work for a company, only if he works for himself. He makes less than what is typical here because he works for the county and has a fantastic benefits package, so it's a trade off. Not that you asked for that much detail, but it explains why it currently seems like he's being underpaid. We also have some connections to his trade industry there, so we're hoping he finds work with no problem.",

Buying a house in cash versus just taking out a down payment and then getting a mortgage comes down to your risk tolerance, though given that mortgage rates are pushing 7% there's certainly a case to be made for buying in cash.",

I'm not positive if the money is being invested or if it's just sitting in a bank account. That's definitely something I will ask about, because I imagine that's the main answer to whether or not I have to pay taxes on it if I withdraw from the trust. So if it's invested, I guess it then becomes a question of the interest rate vs. how much in taxes I'd be paying on whatever I withdraw?",

This suggests that the principal in the trust should not be taxable to you, since it is a gift.\n\nHowever, somebody has to be paying taxes on the trust's investment income - interest, dividends, possibly even realized capital gains. In most cases, the trust itself is filing tax returns and paying the required taxes. Depending on the timing of your withdrawl, you may incur a tax bill on investment earnings received but not yet taxed.",

You have a trust with a half mil, your grandparents are still putting in $35k per year... an accountant is managing the tax filings of the trust.. it sounds like your family is well off. Why aren't you asking a lawyer or the accountant the actual implications of the scenario? It's not that expensive to get a few hours with the lawyer that drew up the trust to get actuals... it's a lot less dumb to pay $2k to a professional than to attach a reddit thread to an audit justifying your stance.",

Yes, my family is well off, but since there are restrictions on most of the funds, for the most part it doesn't have an effect on my day-to-day finances. \n\nSince our 401ks and non-trust savings aren't where we want them to be, I think for me, it's more of a question of use the fund, have extra cash and save as much as we can and not have a mortgage, or preserve the majority of the fund, take out a mortgage, less cash in our bank accounts but more stays in the trust fund. For the actual technical details of doing this, I'll be talking to the lawyer/accountant. \n\nI apologize for being dense, but what in this scenario would cause an audit and how would this post harm me?",

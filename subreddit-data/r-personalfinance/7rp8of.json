            "comment": "You should ask your boss. Could just be a payroll mix-up. Employers are required to deduct taxes from any pay, even if it's a cash bonus.\n\nHe could have told the finance/payroll person to \"make sure to deduct that $100 from u/LouisSeaGays paycheck next week\". He meant deduct the taxes, they heard deduct the whole amount off your check.\n\nSo just call your boss. Say \"hey, I really appreciate the bonus you gave me. I'm a little confused though. Last week I had $100 taken out of my paycheck and it said it was for an advance. Was the $100 you gave me supposed to be a bonus above my normal paycheck or an advance against my future paycheck\"?\n\nHe'll either say it was a bonus and fix it. Or he'll say it was an advance. In which case you can say something like \"oh, well that's disappointing\" and move on. You're not really going to be able to fight it - but now you know your employer isn't as cool as you thought before and maybe that will factor into whether or not you keep working there long term.\n\nEdit: well, this comment got a lot more attention than anticipated! And thank you kind stranger for the gold!\n\nAlso, someone below mentioned it could be a simple payroll error or misreading of the paystub. They may have been paying the bonus in cash, adding an extra $100 to tax it appropriately and then removing the $100 to reconcile. So either way, simple. miscommunication/misunderstanding",

I was given the choice to  repay immediately in full or get no bonus until repaid. And yes, by then I'd spent it all. Stupidly gave my manager an ounce of guff about how they handled it, she got pissed. Took her three weeks to bust me for a small mistake, write up a PIP (a trap I fell into) and fired me.

I really liked the team I worked with and the boss I had.  As a person he treated me very well and liked my work performance and gave me great reviews.  I got training and performance opportunities hoping that would make me more marketable and increase my salary.  However I rarely ever got raises, and when I did, they were minuscule.  My coworkers rarely did either and I think my boss was trying, but state employment where I live does not really encourage salary advancement for employees.  Over the years I have made a habit of working 3-5 years at all my positions before moving on, as that usually gives me the time to maximize my learning and performance before getting burned out/bored and begin to dislike my job.  I started hunting about two years ago but the job hunt took forever as I was trying to be picky about my next move and stay in the state system to keep my benefits.  The new position that I started this month I applied for back in June!  \n\nI will be honest, the change was a bit scary.  I had become very comfortable in my previous position and my coworkers were also my friends outside of work.  I had relatively low stress, enjoyed what I was doing and had a lot of friends both in my team and the people I worked with.  It's been a big change and a bit intimidating, but this was the next step in my career path and a 50% salary increase definitely makes it worthwhile!  Not sure what to recommend to get him interested and looking, especially not knowing what his motivations are for staying or how motivated he is by financial gain.  Good luck with it though.

If the bonus is $100, the paycheck shows $160 and the tax withholding.\n\nEdit: In response to the replies that are getting made and then deleted (just going assume moderator activity and not passive aggression), taxes are not theft, either. Nor are they a penalty on your employer instead of you. If you owe taxes, that means you made money, which is a good thing. They also pay for things you use for free every day. The view that taxes are a penalty placed on you for doing well (instead of being a fair share that we all chip in toward improving the common good) is not just corrosive; it's naive and simplistic.",

It _might_ bump them into the next tax bracket, which in itself is not a big deal when earning enough. It can make life harder if it bumps someone above a limit that grants them certain low-income benefits, though.  \n \nWhere I live, we have a limit (~US$480/month) for low-paying jobs that keeps them at almost zero additional cost in terms of taxes and insurance, as well as still allowing unemployment benefits and similar. If someone gets paid close to that limit, even a $100 bonus can bump them into a \"full employee\". This can negatively affect both parties; increasing the employer\u2019s cost by ~$1800 (as employment taxes and social security costs kick in) and messing up the employee\u2019s unemployment benefits (theoretically the state can then demand the benefit payments back, as they were paid erroneously).",

They offer 'spiffs' to salesmen.\n\nExample:\n\nOn a saturday, salesmen might get offered a $250 bonus if they sell any new car that's been on the lot for more than 60 days. Or any used car that's been on the lot for 45 days *\n\nOr, they might be running what's called a VIN sale. Salesmen get a bonus that's equivalent to the last two numbers of the VIN. Usually this is on used cars since new cars would just look for the same model with the highest VIN.\n\nOR just a straight $500 bonus to the top salesman for a week, or a weekend etc.\n\nAll of those bonuses are paid in cash during a meeting. Then on the next check they will see that amount shown as paid, tax it, then deduct it again.\n\nit's done so they track the money. it's required.\n\n*the reason for these 'sales' and bonuses is because car dealers pay what's called 'flooring' which is finance charges per contract. If they don't turn over inventory in 45 days they start paying flooring. So the longer the car is there past  that date, the more money it costs the dealer.\n\nTarget is 45 days or lower on all cars. This is typical. I've also worked at dealers that don't use financing and own their entire inventory. Doesn't matter. they charge themselves that same flooring (moving money) and the dates are the same\n\nThis is a hint. if you see a new car at a dealer ship and you know it's been there for 2 months or more,  they will offer additional discounts above and beyond factory to dealer incentives just to get the car out of inventory. And they will give a substantial discount, even sometimes taking a loss on the car because the net result is still better for the dealer.\n\nSource: I was a general manager in a 5 line new car dealer (large 20 group dealer) for 15 years\n\nEDIT: i should add, these bonus amounts have likely increased greatly in recent years.\nI left the business in 1998. So 20 years ago",

That way they can account for the additional taxes that will be calculated. Our company just made the same mistake on an employee with $1,000 Christmas bonus. Very embarrassing. We took the thousand-dollar advanced back out and the tax is out, but forgot to gross the payroll backup a thousand dollars. An honest mistake that was corrected quickly.",

I have to deal with HR and payroll people in my job and you wouldn't believe how often something like this can be screwed up over a simple error. To the point where one of my friends in HR at another company once told me \"oh yeah, I always check my paycheck, bonus check, hsa and 401k deductions and matches, etc because stuff gets screwed up all the time and people just have no idea\". That kind of freaked me out and I vowed to always check my stuff.  I have adhd though so I usually forget and don't. But back to the point - it's probably just a mistake or misunderstanding so ABSOLUTELY approach it as such initially! \n\nPs - just to make sure I don't offend anyone - I am not saying everyone in hr or payroll is terrible. It's just that there are a lot of employees and when there are special one off things like this that may or may not have been communicated clearly, mistakes can happen! (And my best friend is in hr and I think she is super smart and great, so I'm def not hating on hr ;)",

The comments about \"probably having to add it to your next check so they can account for payroll taxes\" is exactly correct.\n\nDepending on your payroll service, it's hard to just tack on taxes without listing an amount for which the taxes....tax.\n\nWhen I tell someone they are going to get a bonus like a$250 Christmas Bonus, I calculate the witholding taxes on that and give them a little more so it's really a $250 bonus after taxes paid.",

The boss said I'll give you a raise, and five thousand dollars upon completion. \n\n   I worked my butt off for four months, to keep supplies ordered, putting on material, going to meetings, saftey meetings, making sure our six employees always had tasks to accomplish every day.  Got the job done ahead of schedule, and under budget.  I was the lowest paid person in our company, at fourteen dollars an hour. \n\n   The boss bought a new rental house immediately after the check cleared from Bel Brands. Then paid three of our employees to remodel the house for an entire month. All the while I went to supervise another job this time at a large airport.  I asked for another raise about halfway through the airport gig. Boss said I can give you fifteen dollars an hour. I politely declined, by saying \"I can't sell you anymore of my time at that rate.  It just appears I'm being used, you just hired somebody with less experience  at twenty dollars an hour.\"",

If not, this is really shitty.\nI'm only speaking from my experience working in HR in Texas in the early 2000's.\nUnless you authorize the deduction, you can contest it.  \nNot even sure if that is federal or state, but if an employee did not authorize a deduction, they could file a wage claim and the employer would have two weeks to pay it back.\nEven if the employer overpaid the employee in error, they could not take it back without the employee's authorization.\nNow, the employer could take it as the employee's \"resignation\" if they refuse to authorize a payroll deduction for the overpayment, but they still could not get it back...\nGood luck &amp; sorry this happened to you.\n",

So when you think you have an extra $100.00 coming towards you, when in fact you don\u2019t , it affects you in a drastically negative way. If he clearly made it seem like it was a bonus, then he is in the wrong. I get bonuses for sales at my job and hey don\u2019t take money back from my paycheck, I would be extremely pissed off, due to the fact I struggle with my expenses so if i saw my paycheck was short $100.00 I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay certain bills and it would push me back a good few weeks.\n\nSide note: If he does things like this continually and on purpose, I would consider finding a new job if you have the time to look for one...There are very few things worse then spending 1/3 of your life on a shitty job that pulls shit like this on you and takes advantage of workers ",

Our bosses would routinely have special days where for every collection we gained we would get a cash bonus of $5 on the spot, but they would make us sign our name on a paper. \n\nOnce I realized they were taking it out my check every week I started signing my name illegibly so they couldn't do it anymore. I asked around and while the bosses wrote it off as a \"mixup\" other employees warned me not to speak up or they'd fire me, stating it happened many times already. \n",

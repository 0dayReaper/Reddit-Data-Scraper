    "postText": "My wife has recently started receiving a number of mystery packages in the mail. Started with a random box from Talbots for some pricey boots, then another pair of shoes arrived from the same store. The packages were addressed to her, but she didn't order them, shoes aren't even close to her size and she's never shopped there before so she's not even sure how they would have her address. Recently a $700 coat arrived at our doorstep with the same scenario, but it had no receipt and isn\u2019t a brand that Talbots sells.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWe immediately checked all recent transactions on her Credit Cards and accounts and nothing was out of the ordinary. We pulled her credit report from all 3 bureaus and nothing was opened under her name. We called Talbots and they said there were actually 6 packages in the order total (only received the two), and they gave her the phone number and email address and last four digits of the card and none of the info matched hers, but the address for shipping was hers. Her last name is extremely unique and it\u2019s doubtful there was a data issue.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAnyone have any ideas of what might be going on?",

What usually happens is the criminal account take overs an existing Wal-Mart account and adds a stolen unrelated credit card. They will add physical items, but also digital gift cards. They only want the gift cards. If they created an order for only gift cards it would get flagged. \n\nThe same method can be done on fresh accounts with retailers without existing accounts that again offer digital gift cards instantly. They really do not care who it gets sent to and a lot of the time the person who received free merchandise isn't complaining. You can reach out to the merchants as they most definitely have a chargeback out for the order associated with the item you received. \n\nThey probably won't blacklist your address because you might legitimately order in the future, but if the threat actor hasn't been blocked by device, Ip, and other attributes...they will do so as you are not the only victim.",

She was going to wait until all 6 came in and return them all to the store since we conveniently have one in town, but the rest haven\u2019t shown up yet.

They said something about a fraud investigation?\" \n\nShe turned stark white and literally ran back to her car.

So there's one.\n\nFor two - I didn't suggest they were or weren't popular. I said the person you are trying to argue morals with wasn't arguing about morals. Is it morally wrong? Yeah. Maybe. Depends on where your morals come from. And that's why we have laws so that despite where *your* compass points to *I* can point to the laws as to why you can or cannot do something. Do I personally think it's wrong? ... well, no, becuase\n\n3 - You have yet to inform me how the company takes a loss on this. If the person who made the fraudulent purchase tries to reverse the charges the company now has proof that the purchases were sent to the person they were addressed to.  And even if the company buckles it's because the company has insurance against such claims, and they know it's covered. In fact, if Suzie Q up there sent back that 700 dollar coat, they wouldn't be able to sell it for much more than 400, if they can re-sell it at all. And yes, that's 400 more bucks in their pocket, but they aren't likely losing the all of or any of the 700, either. But would you hold the company morally responsible for not cheating customers out of their money? because we *can* hold them legally responsible. So, in this case, most companies will tell you to keep the item as it is more of a headache to get it shipped back.",

Store management looked into it, and we were the lucky recipients of one of these review scams. We ended up with hundreds of items over about six months. \n\nWe ended up holding a couple of silent auction for employees and were able to raise a lot of money for various charities. Take that, scammers! We used your evil power for good.",

Can you tell me my e-mail addy and phone number?\" (last 4 of the CC is also weird, but typically not something you can make useful... without other steps) ... lul. No. I know it's not *your* fault. It's just weird that one of those 3 pieces of information wasn't required to access the account, ya know? \n\nI mean, you have options. I, personally, would tell them to cancel the rest of the order. The chances that there's an altercation or something happening on/to your property increase with each delivery exponentially, so you'd probably wanna avoid that. You also have the opportunity to reach out to the person (read: likely criminal) via the phone or e-mail and try to sus out this mystery for yourself, straight from the horse's mouth. You could also lay a trap. When the next package gets deliver, put a biggggg cardboard box over it, with a stick to prop it up, and a string to tie the stick to the box, so when they come to collect it WHAM. Catch a crook. Or you could replace it with [a glitter bomb.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoxhDk-hwuo) (There's 5 years of that stuff - check it out if you haven't already) Or you could just do the risky biscuit and leave it there till they show up to pick it up and confront them in person. ... hopefully with protection in your hand. \n\nBasically, reddit can speculate for you, but you have the ability to actually effect the outcome.",

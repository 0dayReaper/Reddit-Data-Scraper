    "postText": "Update 3: $3332 returned!\n\nUpdate 2: Holy moly! $2361 returned to redditors so far! If you reached out for help, don\u2019t forget to share your update here!\n\nUpdate 1: WOW! Thanks for your votes and gold and sweet notes. Adding more resources below and an ask to share this post with people who might need it.\n\u2014\nAll of these companies are regulated \u2014 a government agency is paid by your taxes to make sure you\u2019re not ripped off. These companies also rip you off in small amounts in part because they assume you won\u2019t do anything about it. When you complain about it to the government agency that regulates them, they not only fix your problem but if enough people complain, they\u2019ll fix the whole system, which helps other people.\n\nThe types of problems could be billing (they overcharge you), service (you\u2019re not getting what you\u2019re paying for), unfair and deceptive practices (you were tricked) or more. All of these complaint systems work in 2 weeks or less and it\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s sort of crazy more people don\u2019t know about them.\n\nInternet: https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824\n\nBanks/student loans/credit reports/debt collectors etc: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/\n\nHealth insurance: Google \u201c[state where you live] health insurance complaint\u201d and select the government agency that will let you file a consumer complaint. It\u2019s usually an insurance commissioner. Here\u2019s the form for Texas for example: http://www.tdi.texas.gov/consumer/complfrm.html#four\n\nCable: https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=33794\n\nCell phone: https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=39744\n\nOther company (home security system, eBay, Amazon, contractors): google \u201c[your state] attorney general consumer complaint.\u201d\n\nYour landlord (won\u2019t return your deposit, won\u2019t fix the heat etc): google \u201c[your city] tenant advocate.\u201d They typically have excellent, free advice.\n\nKind of everything falling apart (out of money, need housing help, low cost/free health or mental services etc): Call 211 (works in many us cities but not all). It\u2019s like an artisanal version of this post \u2014 they will personally help you find all the local services.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to complain, share your issue in the comments and I\u2019ll help you find the right spot!",

The internet never started working, they refused to send a tech out and instead sent me two more replacement modems. After a pretty short amount of time trying the modems with no success, I called and canceled and they confirmed it looked like I never had working internet and they said no bills, etc, it's all taken care of... Except every month for about half a year, they would send me a bill for multiple months of internet that I never received or was even a customer for in terms of length of time. Every month I would spend at least an hour on hold with at least one phone call to have the bill removed from my account. It. Never. Got. Fixed. \n\nI didn't really know what to do, they kept saying the issue had been dealt with and every call ended up the same way: there was no dispute of the charges, they knew they shouldn't be on the bill, it was fixed. Finally, when the bill I got came with a notice saying it was going to collections in a couple weeks if I didn't pay, I posted on this sub and received advice to contact the FCC and file a complaint. Within a few days of me doing that, I was called by someone much higher up in Frontier and they told me they received my complaint and that it should really truly be all fixed now. And *finally* it was. But it really did take the FCC complaint. ",

This went on for months and we never paid a full bill. Finally we canceled. Recently we got frontier back but before so I asked if the problem was fixed and the rep swore it was handled. Of course the same day we had it, it was doing the same thing. They switched modems a dozen times and never fixed it. Finally they found it was a short in the line. Now we pay for 12mbps (most we can get in our area) and most of the time we get 6/7mbps and I've called numerous times about it and never get a answer. It's pretty bad. ",

Customer service really couldnt have helped you with this issue. It was a field tech that needed to.  Why it took so long idk, and it shouldnt have.\n\nBut i can say this, calls \"are suppose to be less than 10 minutes\" requirements on a call are \"make a sell no matter what the call is about\", \"state first name, frontier and survery\", do not transfer. Well People who work for ftr customer service really dont care. I saw ppl hang up 2 mins into a call, transfer to the person sitting next to them and pretend to be a supervisor, add things to bills customers never asked for. The list is endless. it also made me realize that things like this probably happen at telecommunications company in the US. \n\nI got stories man, stories of spending hours on phone calls with customers just to get their accounts fixed. It got to the point where i was running my own little fix it center b4 i quit. I would give customer's my email and work on their account for them and set up call back times to have the account fixed. It was fucking endless. ",

He claiming since we\u2019re a studio apartment, that he\u2019s charging us for that. \n\nWhat sucks is I\u2019m good neighbors with the 3 other studio tenants and none are getting charged for space. \n\nSo yeah, get everything in writing!.

Later sent me a notice that I owed the months rent + $150 in late fees. \n\nNew management was apologetic and were cleaning up old shady managements shit. Told me to send them everything I had since the whole \"kick out + not paying rent\" thing was not in writing. OH! And they never properly checked me out, so it said I moved out on the last day of my lease, even though I had moved and started a new job by then. \n\nI had an email from old management claiming I owed them for electric (I didn't, I paid my electric and closed my account when I moved out, which they fixed). In the email, I mentioned them kicking me out, and the date I left. I also had saved dated snapchats of when I moved out, pictures of my stuff in storage, a contract from the storage place, and copies of checks that proved I paid the electric. \n\nThe real estate investment place cleared all my charges :)",

We were there for \\_years\\_.\n\nIn the state of Maryland if the landlord doesn't get you your deposit back in 45 days or provide a reason why they're not returning it they forfeit the right to keep any of it \\- and you can sue for 3x the amount in court and win.\n\nWhen we moved out we didn't say a word. Once 45 days were up we asked the landlords where our deposit was and they said they were keeping it because the place was \"dirty\" basically... they cited a bunch of issues that existed when we moved in \\(which we had documented\\) and a bunch of trivial cleaning stuff like some dead bugs in the window frame.... and some dust on the floor.\n\nNeedless to say we pointed out the law to them about how they have no right to keep any deposit because it had been too long... we threatened court. Then we got a check in the mail an never heard another word from them.\n\nDon't fuck with your tenants.",

I had a one year contract that specifically said it would not auto-renew. They tried to say I came in and signed a new contract, and, when I asked to see it, they sent the old one but totally blurred. I had moved to a new state and wasn\u2019t even around at the time they said I signed the new one, so I knew I wasn\u2019t insane. It was the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had with a business. I have two bank accounts, and I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t watching this one as well as I should have been, but, sometimes, it\u2019s hard to notice when it\u2019s only $10 off. It went on for 8 months after my membership was supposed to end. The only reason I caught it was because it caused me to overdraw and rack up a ton of fees. I got the bank fees back, but I had to fight to get anything back from PF. When they finally agreed to give a refund, it was only 3 months ($30), and they \u201cwaived\u201d the cancellation fees\u2014cancellation fees for an account I hadn\u2019t opened. Whatever. I accepted it and stopped fighting, but I shit talk them every chance I get. ",

So, in terms of cash flow, credit card chargebacks are much preferable.  I think it's generally also easier to initiate a dispute on a credit card.\n\nI'm super particular about who I'll give my debit card information to (usually, only use it at ATMs if I need cash) because if someone steals my card info then I'm probably out whatever cash they steal for at least a couple of weeks.  Credit cards is a non-issue.\n\nAs well, credit cards typically earn you some sort of rewards with each purchase.  Might as well get something for spending your money.  IMO the only real reason not to use a CC for everything is if you A) can't get one, or B) would be irresponsible with one.",

Bear in mind, even if you get your money back, the entity that you filed the grievance against isn't required to do business with you and may terminate your account because you are a problem customer. That may not apply to utilities but ISPs are not utilities. Neither is paypal.

            "comment": "Michigan allows one sided voice recording. What that means is you can legally record a conversation without the other parties consent. I did this with Xfinity in regards to internet speed throttling. At first I never mentioned the recording but after several phone calls i realized that telling them I was recording broke them out of their scripts. I would get screamed at. Not lying. They would scream at me and tell me that\u2019s it illegal. Only they can record you. \n\nFinally, my recording worked and I tripped someone up. Me and my wife are gamers and we use speed checks regularly to gauge peak and low yield times using \u201cOokla\u201d. Most companies use ookla so they really won\u2019t be able to dispute the results. Note: do not use their web page which offers ookla testing. \n\nWell the tech stated that yes your service was throttled back after questioning him. He immediately stuttered and stated that it isn\u2019t possible for them to do that. See the key is to tell them about letters they send out to high volume download homes. They basically state that they have monitored your service and believe you are acting out of their guidelines so they will slow your speeds to stop you from doing this. \n\nI finally took that recording and sent it to the FCC. I also emailed Xfinity/Comcast and advised them the same. Either way FCC will notify them. \n\nI received a call from someone locally who dealt with securities fraud, fcc nonsense for Xfinity. She was awesome and had to have a tech come out to \u201ccheck my lines\u201d to make sure the speeds weren\u2019t down because of that.  While speaking with her she admitted that it can be done but it shouldn\u2019t have and started he process of my free two year internet, cable and home security for the next few years. All because I was persistent and documented everything. \n\nNOTE: while the tech was at my house he became very irate with me. I\u2019m assuming because he had to replace all the lines on my property for no other reason but for a show to appease the FCC. While speaking with him the lady I was speaking with was still on the phone, silently listening on speaker. She wanted to judge the tech and make sure he didn\u2019t irritate me. Well he started talking and basically we got into a pissing contest in my kitchen.  He also stated that I\u2019m now showing 10mb faster speeds that I\u2019m paying for and that he was gonna snake sure it was slowed by 50mb. You know, just to show me. That\u2019s when it happened. The nice lady started screaming so loudly at him that she made me, the wife, my two dogs and the tech jump out of fright. She laid into him and now had to get a bit more real. Either way because of that I ended up with 3+ years of free service. \n\n",

I texted him back saying the 30 days had expired and I was going to sue him for double damages in small claims court if he didn't send me the full amount. The next message I got was \"sent\" I got the check for the full amount a week later. I guess he didn't want to fly to Ohio from California to appear in court.

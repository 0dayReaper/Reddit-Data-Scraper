I was insured at the time and the insurance company told me they would pay 100% before I went. I never saw any bills before they showed up on my credit report. How should I approached getting these corrected?",

The problem is it might not cover everything else. For example, I went to ER twice last year. Insurance (partially) covered my intake and various tests I got, plus a doc that was employed by the hospital. What did my insurance not pay for? Another ER doctor. Why not? Out of network (not a hospital employee). Thanks to California law, however, I didn't have to pay the full billed amount. \n\nI'm not really helping you with this information, sorry. Have you received anything from a collections agency? If not, then I'd look into filing a dispute with the credit rating agencies. If you have, find out who passed it into them (hospital or a 3rd party medical company), then reach out to them directly and ask wtf?\n\nEdit to add: I'm guessing it is a hospital contractor and the hospital didn't give them your insurance information. That's what happened to me. I then gave the contractor my insurance info, they then reduced my bill, as required by CA law, and I paid the revised amount.",

Come to find out the billing department, for wherever this bill was coming from, had the wrong address. Literally every other department in the hospital had their correct address but billing screwed it up somehow. I forget all the details but it was just one lingering bill, they had paid everything else. So, it wasn't like they paid nothing and should have known they had outstanding bills. \n\nMy brother was pissed. His wife's credit and income were enough for the mortgage, so they left him off. They let the collections bill rot and waited the 7 years or whatever for it to come off his credit.",

I just got a collections notice due to a billing error and was able to call the office and pay it. If they never billed your insurance, you can call the hospital billing department and they should be able to retro bill it to the insurance company. If they for some reason can't (or won't), you can pay the bill out of pocket (get a detailed, line by line invoice), and you can submit a claim to the insurance company yourself for reimbursement. \n\nIf you can get to a live person and explain the situation beforehand, they may be able to advise you on the correct course of action.",

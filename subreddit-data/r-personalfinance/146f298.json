    "postText": "Have about $10,500 in credit card debt of $13,600 limit total which has caused my score to drop tremendously. This consists of about $5k on 2 different cards. I also recently started my first job out of college making $78k before taxes (which is much more than ive ever made). I\u2019m wondering whether I\u2019m better off doing one of the following:\n\n1. consolidating my debt with a personal loan to cover it all and pay off over a few years\n\nor \n\n2. applying for a balance transfer card for one of the two (to increase my credit limit while maintaining 0% interest on one of the cards for 18 months). I would be paying off the one with the higher interest as much as I can. Then after 18 mo, get a personal loan for both balances. I would expect to then consolidate about 6k. \n\nWhat would make more sense to increase my credit score fastest?",

Don't risk getting your loan denied because it will. Lower your credit score. \n\nTry using either the Avalanche or the Snowball method to bring down your debt. There are YouTube videos that have extensive information on these two methods. Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

            "comment": "Balance transfer cards typically require a decent credit score, something in the 680 range. \n\nYou say you just started your job, I think typically they'll look to see how long have you been employed and what your average paycheck was, when they decide to give you a loan or not. Where I live (in Europe), I couldn't even apply for a credit card without a minimum of 3 months of continuous employment. \n\nLowering your utilization will improve your credit score. Make an effort when you get paid to pay more than the minimums on the cards that are closest to the limit.\n\nIf your credit score is good enough, apply for a balance transfer card even if it's for a few thousands, not 5k or however much you owe on one card. \n\nYou could apply for a personal loan a few weeks later after the balance transfer card comes or maybe try to get a second balance transfer card but keep in mind that you'll have to pay a bigger chunk of money each month, make sure there's enough for rent, food, gas money, insurance etc etc.",

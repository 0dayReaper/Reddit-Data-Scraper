    "postText": "Many people I see go into a store to buy one or two things, and come out with way more than they anticipated, with the excuse \"oh I saved money! It was all on sale!\". \n\nIf you we're going to get the item anyway, yes you saved money, but if you didn't plan on it, you still spent money you didn't have to.\n\nEDIT: You could also set a budget, $150 for example. If you're going into a store, don't bring your card, only bring cash so you're not tempted to go over your limit. (Edit of an edit: Someone mentioned you could miss out on some rewards or promotions if you don't have your card, so I wonder what another way to limit yourself other than willpower would be?)\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you all so much for the support on this post, I tried replying to the comments at the start but it became overwhelming with the amount of comments coming in, thank you all for your input and advice to others!\n\nANOTHER EDIT: Thank you kind one for the gold!

If you can't find the model number at other retailers, then it's either special to that retailer (Best Buy and Insignia products, for example) or it's a black friday special item.\n\nThe cheap $150 42\" TV door buster is almost certainly black friday-specific schlock.  The $1000 off a $3000 TV from a good name brand with a model that matches standards is not black friday-specific hardware.",

I did some shopping around and found it at a good price on Amazon. I then saw that my local Best Buy had it in stock. Best Buy does price matching with Amazon. On Amazon, and every other retailer, the model number for the video card was the same. However, for Best Buy, the model number has a BB appended to the end of it. Best Buy wanted to argue that it wasn't the same thing, so they weren't going to price match it. I tried explaining it was literally the same thing, even the box is the same. The model number is essentially the same. On and on. Finally, after 30 minutes of arguing, and me beginning to walk out of the store without the nearly $1000 worth of other stuff I was getting that day, the manager relented and price matched.",

Best Buy's SKU being unique is irrelevant if you can demonstrate that the UPC is the same, in fact it would be a weird thing to learn that any SKU for a particular product at best buy matched the SKU for the same product model at any other retailer.    If you had a store you could make a SKU just \"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ\" or whatever else you wanted but that wouldn't make it a different product.\n\nI think what you're describing is that the model # is actually different for certain retailers, and there is in that case no guarantee that it's the same product.  Some appliance retailers for example will order the same fridge that everyone else sells but without the water filter.  And sell it a little cheaper, but you will find a little difference in the model # and it's not exactly the same product.  So when a product at a certail retailer has a different model # it's completely fair to wonder whether certain features have been left out for cost-saving reasons while appearing outwardly to be the model that has all the features of the generic model #.  Or whether certain features have been added that the retailer thinks are worth it, like a laptop that comes with a best buy program preloaded.\n\nI worked at an electronics place and don't do that anymore but now work sales at a business to business wholesaler, so my source is just what I've learned but I think I've got a pretty good grounding",

It doesn't matter how new the product is, you'll find some deal on it.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S9+, at about a price of $900 a week ago? $500-600 now.  Brand new samsung 4k TV's? 50% off, sometimes more. \n\nAnd you don't even have to stress at all, most stores have the same offers online. And at the same time, it isn't really Black Friday here anymore, it's more of a ''Black Week''.  A lot of stores have the same offers the whole week, while some add offers every day etc.\n\nYou can literally save 50% off anything you could ever want, if you just buy it on Black Friday. ",

Every sale is designed to get you to buy a product you wouldn\u2019t otherwise buy. You can shop around for the best deal on a product you want but that\u2019s not any business have sales. If it was just about getting you to buy the product from their retailer opposed to another then they would keep the price lower all the time. But most people don\u2019t shop that way. The reason it\u2019s temporary is get people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise buy it excited so the store can move tricky products and bring people into the store. ",

I collect Blurays, (now 4K), so for me, Black Friday has ALWAYS been worth it. I only spent 130 dollars this year and literally bought 20 Blurays, all quality too that I held off on buying all year. As someone with their eye on DVD sales all year, I assure you you won't find deals like this any day of the year. Plenty of clothing stores have 50 percent off the entire store. You just have to be smart about it, like everything else. Any sales in the 25-30 percent off range is usually bullshit.",

This year we popped into home Depot at 11 am, they still had one we liked for the door buster price and we walked out happy. Same thing for me with Forza video game, couldn't justify $60 but $30 works. It'll probably drop to this level once or twice more in the retail season but I am happy having it now.",

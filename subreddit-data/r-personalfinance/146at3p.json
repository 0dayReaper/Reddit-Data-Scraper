    "postText": "(in USA) My partner has a brokerage account, and in it there are investments that came from a UTMA account her parents started contributing to when she was very young. Unfortunately they have lost all records. The bulk of it are uncovered shares. The brokerage doesn't have any records from anything past ten or so years ago. We'll continue to probe the brokerage to see if they can produce anything else, but, assuming that fails, how can we handle this? We want to sell the shares and put them in something safer since we'll be starting a house search soon.\n\nI had read that it may be acceptable to put together an estimate of the cost basis by using historical market data, but that sounds flimsy to me.",

            "comment": "I'm in a similar situation...but different.  My grandmother or grandparents opened up a UGMA for me...  and funded it with a few shares of AT&amp;T stock, plus a mutual fund to capture the dividends.\n\nthis is way back...  before the baby bells were pulled out of AT&amp;T.  I have no idea when they purchased the shares...and there was some jankiness involved.  \n\nI use the value of the shares on the date I took control (because of the jankiness).\n\n**Easiest legal option is to use a cost-basis of zero.**  If you sell and you use a cost basis of zero, you simply pay 15% of the proceeds. in taxes.\n\nSo...Jankiness:  my grandparents opened up an UGMA for me but not for my brother.  I knew nothing about it until I was 30...and grandma went through paperwork to split the UGMA between me and my brother.  I signed off on her wanting to do this.  (Literally had to go to a bank and they registered Medallion-Guaranteed signatures on the paperwork).  I don't know if this is legal, but this is what I've been using since I got control of the stock 25 years ago.  Mostly it's been sales of fractional shares resulting from M&amp;A activity.",

This exists specifically to preclude highly volatile markets where automated appraisal solutions are in use from generating high LTV's when that's not reflective of reality.",

We contacted the mortgage company and asked them to start the process to have the house re appraised.  They sent an appraiser and the new value (value increased by 25%) put us over 20% equity.  They dropped the PMI.\n\nBut we had to initiate this process with them.  It was not automatic.",

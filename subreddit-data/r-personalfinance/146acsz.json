    "postText": "My mortgage rate is 2.875% and is supposed to mature in 2050.  I am 40 now and should be able to retire in about 18 years.  Wondering if I should increase my monthly mortgage payments so that my house is paid off right around the time I retire.  Or should I just continue to invest that extra money?\n\nEdit:  Appreciate the advice.  I kind of figured investing the extra money would be the better move considering the low interest rate on my mortgage.  Never really did the math on it, but thank you all for confirming it.",

You can earn more in a risk-free savings account or money market fund than you \"lose\" in mortgage interest, even after accounting for taxes. As long as your savings account's after-tax yield is higher than your mortgage interest, spending cash from that account to pay down your mortgage just *increases* the amount of time it will take to pay your mortgage off.\n* \"Peace of mind\"? Security comes from knowing that you have the liquid assets to pay for your expenses, even if you lost your work income. Liquid cash (or cash equivalents) brings more security than home equity, since you can easily use liquid cash to pay your expenses. You have to borrow against your home equity to use it to pay expenses, an indirect process that also usually requires you to have income.\n\nI honestly don't believe there is a reasonable argument to pay one cent more toward your mortgage when you can earn more in interest with a risk-free savings account.

    "postText": "Hello all, this is a question for UK residents. I\u2019m lending a friend a few 1000 pounds. (Please don\u2019t bother to comment on the wisdom of this, the decision is made and I\u2019m happy to make the loan.)\n\nShould we get witnesses to sign the agreement or is an email outlining the terms in detail sufficient? Circumstances can change and the unexpected can happen. What do we need to do to protect both our interests in these circumstances?  All good faith suggestions welcome.",

Are you actually willing to go to court as recourse if they don\u2019t pay back on the agreed upon timeline, which of course would end the friendship permanently? Because otherwise it\u2019s just a piece of paper.",

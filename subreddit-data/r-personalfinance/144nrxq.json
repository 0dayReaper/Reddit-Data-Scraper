    "postText": "I am a mid twenties high income earner (~300k). I\u2019m financially literate and already budget, max out my 401k, mega back door Roth, and have little debt (30k worth with &lt;3%). I am considering real estate as my next large purchase \u2014 either as a primary home or rental.\n\nI found a FP that is willing to give guidance on different scenarios of what I can afford in terms of real estate investing and is charging a flat fee of $4k to give a 6 month plan with weekly meetings.\n\nAre financial planners worth it and is this a reasonable offer?\n\nEdit: 350$ mo continued planning, 0.25% advisement fee of any asset amount",

Your goals in life should not be money itself although you may need lots of capital to achieve them. But what are they...and how much capital?",

In your case that means a net of $300k and hence a likely gross for him, one assistant and an office of $600k annually.   I couldn't get to that number with $4k for six months worth of weekly meetings.   The $350/mo and quarter point get me closer to feeling good, but I am not yet there.   What else does he need to charge you and his other clients to hit that $600k minimum and if he can't hit that minimum I don't want advice from somebody less successful than I am particularly if he/she is older and more experienced that I am.",

Especially, if it\u2019s a general kind of adviser and not someone who specializes in real estate investing. \n\nI\u2019d check out a book (or e-book) at your library (or buy) on real estate investing and first give it a quick look. I bet most of your questions will be answered right there. If after that you still want to invest or buy \u2014 go to a local RE investing meetup (or find a webinar) and ask questions there. \n\nIt\u2019s going to take time and work, but you\u2019ll make a more confident decision based on that. And there\u2019s no point in rushing this decision in this market either, you\u2019re not going to loose anything by waiting a few more months. \n\nA general financial advisor doesn\u2019t have a steak in your decisions of this kind, so they are almost useless for this particular case. \n\nIf you find someone with a portfolio of a dozen or more units in the local market over the course of a decade or more who would be willing to coach you \u2014 that\u2019d be another story. \n\n\u201cRegular\u201d advisors can be useful, but for other kinds of questions.",

It's no different than paying someone to clean your house, do your taxes or do work on your car.\n\nThat said, you're also young enough that spending time *now* to learn this stuff will pay off handsomely down the road.

    "postText": "I want to put some of my money in the ESPP. They'll let me invest up to 10% of my after-tax paycheck. The discount is 5% of the market value. Stocks are purchased every three months. Can someone explain to me how this works and what's the best way to go about it so I can make a profit?",

            "comment": "The easiest is to put some amount of money (hopefully the full 10% if you can afford it) and then sell the stock as soon as you receive it. Normally pull make at least 5% minus capital gains. \n\nIf the company is solid, and seems to be growing, keeping it for a few years to save capital gains and let it grow is good. \n\nThis is a gross oversimplification on stock investing but it\u2019s a place to start.",

                    "comment": "This is where I would start (take advantage of the plan but sell as soon as the shares are available). Even better if your plan allows you to set up your espp shares to be automatically sold as soon as they are available for sale. \n\n5% is not a great discount, but probably enough that you will make some profit except in more exceptional conditions.\n\nEspp taxation is a pain to deal with. Basically, when you sell the shares, you will owe w2 income on the discount (which for me is automatically included on my W2), but this is not counted in the 1099 cost basis, so if you do no adjustments to the cost basis you will be double taxed on the income portion. The budget versions of tax software won't handle this, but the premium versions do.\n\nOne other reason to participate; it is a good way to do automatic savings. 10% comes out of your paycheck, hopefully you don't miss it too much, and when you sell, put the whole sum into savings rather than going on a spending binge.\n\nIf you do decide to hold, have an exit plan for when to sell. For me, I have a target percentage for company stock in my portfolio (pretty small percentage). If for whatever reason that percentage is exceeded, I sell to bring it back in balance. But holding company stock is pretty low on the list of investing priorities, below emergency savings, Roth, 401k, HSA, and other tax advantaged accounts. Too many ways to get burned holding too much company stock.",

You instantly make $250. Minus taxes and selling fees and you're at some $200. Is $200 worth your time? Don't forget about income taxes next year.\n\nAlso consider if your company stock is volatile meaning it drops +/- 5% often. You could wipe out your $200 profit instantly between the time you purchase and the time you sell which at best takes about a week for funds to settle after buying and for selling.",

Taxes become a bit complicated when you're dealing with ESPP shares, discounts, adjusted costs basis, etc. The return you get on participating in an ESPP needs to also be worth the time/headaches/money that comes with doing your taxes.",

Then every 6 months they buy it at the price at a 10-15% discount premium. There may be other companies that do the lower of the start or end date, but that's uncommon.",

If you think it will definitely outperform other companies, you're wrong.",

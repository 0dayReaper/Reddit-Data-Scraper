    "postText": "So, I need 3k, to be able to afford the downpayment for a rental apartment. I was wondering what was the optimal way to save and save an also entire month in between July and august since most likely I will not be earning any significant income during that time period. If you could reach towards a financial perspective, on what I could do to get that money \u201cfast\u201d it would be much appreciated. My income is not so great 2.2k per month, and the rent I would be paying would be 1.98k per month. I have about 2k saved. I have a lot of stuff that I can sell around my house but I am awful at selling stuff on Craigslist, so a lot of listed items that are of high value are just waiting to be bought. I sought the advice from a financial advisor and they told me it would be optimal if I put my income into investment for 3 months but, I just can\u2019t wait that long.\n\nShort story; I live in an abusive household sharing a room with two OLDER brothers age 28,30. Every day I spend in my house, is a day wasted of my youth, so like that financial advisor said is good advice, it\u2019s not the right circumstances to live a healthy life at home and have a healthy mindset. My parents don\u2019t give a crap, but that\u2019s life. I should be able to afford the apartment but I don\u2019t want to see myself in a position where I would have to MOVE back because I screwed up. Insight?",

So that advice is worthless.\n\nYou need a budget. You need to determine how much you have net after expenses. How much of your monthly income goes to expenses? How is left over? You need to do the math and see how long it will take you to save for the down payment.\n\nAnd, can you actually afford the apartment? Doesn\u2019t look like you have much left over from your monthly income after paying rent",

There is a short break during July, hence the no income. We can afford the apartment but there will be a nasty negative catching up to me every month. I\u2019m planning to save 300 x 12 and put it into a separate bank account for emergency in case I need it to deal with the negative",

I will speak to many more financial advisors before I make my decision. Also, by employing budgeting and prioritization techniques, I can create a focused budget that caters to essential expenses such as gas, food, and other necessities (I do not require that much luxury, just being on a computer is good enough for me.) I will be vigilant and cautious in managing these expenses (by creating a detailed financial plan). Additionally, residing in my own space, rather than enduring a difficult living situation, opens up many many opportunities for additional income through endeavors like babysitting and dog walking because I will have so much free time to use and it will be ridiculous how much potential I have that is being wasted suffering for no reason. It is true that my current diet may not be the healthiest (I eat ramen), but given that I am accustomed to a modest diet, reducing food expenses would not significantly impact my situation. In circumstances where the burden is particularly high, I can explore government programs such as Food Stamps to alleviate some of the financial strain. Furthermore, I possess adaptability and resilience, having already adapted to unfavorable circumstances. I am committed to developing a comprehensive financial plan and ensuring sufficient savings to avoid returning to a difficult living situation and enduring severe consequences. I will again research and make well informed calculations.",

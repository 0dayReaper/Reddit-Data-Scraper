If the IRA holds a portion of the dentists office, you cannot have any gain from it. You cannot pull a paycheck, you cannot get be comped patient, etc. Only the IRA can benefit. \n\nI may be over simplifying it because I'm not a lawyer.",

Your typical brokerage probably won't allow you to do this.\n\nYou will need to be more specific about what \"an investment in a set of dental practices\" actually means.  Are you actually establishing and running these dental practices yourself, or are you just investing in existing practices (in other words, private equity).  The latter is pretty straight-forward at a custodian that supports private equity.  The former may be more difficult, I don't know.\n\nCustodians that do this sort of thing tend to have high fees, including ongoing regular fees just to hold the private investment, so be prepared for that.\n\nIt is unlikely that a \"wealth advisor\" is going to help you with something like this, but you never know.",

To answer your Q, I'd be investing in a DSO (dental service organization) that will be acquiring existing dental practices. I would be a non-operator. \n\nYou're probably right about the capabilities of a wealth advisor, I kind of use that term as a catch all term describing a person with tax, estate, wealth management expertise.",

There are certain legal qualifications and structures for what the custodian will accept -- not all custodians accept all investments, and the investment has to do certain things to be held inside an IRA.  The custodian may have to research the investment before they agree to hold it.",

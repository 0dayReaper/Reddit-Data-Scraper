    "postText": "In the past couple of years ive had some pretty rough times with Retail Therapy due to mental health stuff which ive recently started seeking help for a few months back.\n\nDuring that time ive racked up over 10k on 1 credit card with really high interest that im struggling to pay down. Ive managed to get a zero interest card but only approved for a fraction of what i owe, and have looked into personal loans but all of them seem to have just as bad interest as im currently dealing with if not worse.\n\nIve tightened down my budget, stopped basically all of my spending except for groceries and other necessities and one date night with my SO every other week for the sake of our relationship health. \n\nA second job is unfortunately not an option for me as i have some set personal responsibilities to attend to after work.\n\nI just recently switched jobs and have just become eligible for my new company's 401k plan.  Im going to transfer my previous 401k over from my old company where i had it for over 9 years.\n\nThe obvious answer to me seems to be no after looking at the fees (income tax + 10%), but i figured id double check after seeing a couple articles that say it could be a viable solution for high interest credit card debt. \n\nI know i can take loans from my 401k but idk if im eligible this soon, and for that high of an amount.",

So Spouse's debt is my debt.   And my income is Spouse's income.  By choice.  If you're married, that's an option.  If you're casually dating, then absolutely not.\n\nRather than pulling out of the 401k, another option is a 401k loan.  A lot of former employers don't like supporting a 401k loan, but after you move the 401k money, maybe you can.\n\nThe other option is just to budget to pay the cards.  A loan, whether from a 401k or another source doesn't solve the problem...  it's like fixing a hole in the wall by putting wallpaper over it.",

Are you going to cut the cards up, throw them in the trash and do debit only after this? That\u2019s what i did to eliminate overspending and it worked. Make a plan. Make a budget and stick to it or you will find yourself back in the same situation but this time with less money in your retirement account.",

There are YouTube videos that have extensive information on these two methods. Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

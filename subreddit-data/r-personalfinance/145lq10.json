    "postText": "Im 29 and I'm now just moving out of my parents' auto insurance policy since I'm now in NC as opposed to FL and was given a quote of $130  from a broker. Does that sound reasonable? Still sounds high to me honestly. I'm trying to keep costs of everything as low as possible because, unfortunately, money refuses to grow on trees in this economy.",

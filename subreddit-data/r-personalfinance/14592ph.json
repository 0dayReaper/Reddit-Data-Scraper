    "postText": "Getting mixed information so wanted to post here too. I recently moved to the US and got a car loan 2 months ago, approved for a high APR (9%) since I had no credit history. \n\nNow I have the ability to pay it all off since I got my bonus. I now have a credit score which I\u2019m building through a secured credit card. So there\u2019s two accounts on my credit report: the loan and the card. \n\nIf I pay off my loan completely without making further payments, will that drop my score? I\u2019d rather not pay a significant amount of interest but also don\u2019t want my score to drop since I\u2019m new here.\n\nEdit: $11k left on a 2 year loan.",

    "postText": "I'm on the market as a first time home buyer with my wife. Since we are new to this, it's a little nerve-wracking to see how much money is getting thrown around. Although we make good money (I make 170k, she makes 70k), I grew up poor and I can't tell if following through on this particular property would be a poor financial decision or if I'm just nervous about taking on any amount of debt \n\nBoston is an expensive market and we're interested in\n condos within the city. We've lived in small condos for years and it fits our lifestyle well. We fell in love with this particular place below. Incredibly nice neighborhood.\n\nProperty Value: 499k\nDown Payment: 100k\nMortgage: 399k\nInterest Rate: 7.125\nTotal Monthly Costs: 4,000 (2,700 P&amp;I, 750 Condo Fee, the rest is insurance, internet, electricity, property taxes)\nCombined Income: 240k\nCombined Take Home Pay per Month: 11,400\nCurrent Monthly Costs (Rent and associated): 3,300\nRemaining Combined Savings after Downpayment: 25k\nNo Debts\n\nIs this unreasonable? This place is the top of what we are willing to consider when doing the math, which makes me want to check in with others\n\nEdit 1 - updated a typo on my takehome pay\n\nEdit 2 - to provide clarity around some common questions popping up: The $4,000 monthly cost figure above includes property taxes (which are 375 a month, ~4510 for the year). The Condo/HOA fee includes building and grounds maintenance (includes elevator), snow removal, trash and master insurance for the building (all units contribute to the building's insurance, essentially). It's a managed building with a manager onsite M-F.",

Are there amenities like a pool and fitness center? What has been the history of HOA dues hikes?\n\n* your take home is significantly  under 173k because of 401k. If there is an emergency be prepared to pause 401k.\n\n* 25k in your emergency fund is too low. There is always something major that goes wrong with used home in the first year.\n\nGiven the interest rate, disposable income should go toward paying extra principal.",

It covers costs for water, maintenance of the overall building, grounds, snow removal, trash and master insurance for the building itself. There's an elevator in the building too, which I've heard can be expensive to maintain\n\nAgreed regarding the 401k. My take home pay is larger towards the end of the year since I hit the contribution limit and my paychecks stop contributing to my 401k entirely. I'm going to adjust my contributions to \"smooth out\" take home pay fluctuations in general.\n\nOur plan was to get our emergency savings back up to 50k as soon as possible, after giving up the 100k deposit. Then to switch to putting all extra money towards the principal.",

Purchases usually are a large factor in how assessors value properties and if the unit hasn't been sold recently, you could see a large spike if, let's say, the property is only valued at 250k right now. It generally takes 2 years or so to reflect on the bill so be prepared for that. \n\nYou should also consider that the current owner may already get the personal exemption and so that could be factored into the current number you're getting from the lender.

My experiences are Chicago, Calgary, Colorado Springs, and Tucson.\n\nJust spitballing here, but I suspect it melts on its own at a rate closer to Chicago or Calgary than to CS or Tucson. \n\nWhen I lived in Colorado and had a 200 ft driveway, I priced snow removal, and determined that pay as needed is useless (cause when a foot or more dumps, I will be last in line) and guaranteed removal is too expensive. Our HOA, which was charging $10 a year, looked at snow removal, and the owners said \u201chell no\u201d.\n\nSnow tires, studs, and eventually, as vehicles got replaced, 4WD was cheaper.\n\nI will hazard a guess that the HOA prices in at least 50 inches of removal of slowly melting snow per year.",

You have no idea, and are just taking shots in the dark.\n\nWe increased our reserves each year and not once did any repairs cause us to dip into repairs. A $3000 gate repair would easily have been covered by our annual emergency fund. Ot even a $23,000 replacement.\n\nWe had plenty of resources to cover our first major reserve item: exterior re-paint of unit, and depletion of the reserves for paint had no impact on the reserves for a new roof, which we anticipated in the next 15 years. \n\nWe adjusted the dues during each annual budget cycle and accounted for reserves each time. This included inflationz When building material prices hyper inflated during  covid, the portion of the dues that went toward roof replacement was over inflated to allow the reserve to be adequate when the time came. \n\nWhen I sold my unit, my share of reserves was well into 5 figures, and no I did not get that money back at closing.\n\nYou might be confused because you thing real estate costs means building cost. In VHCOLs, often most of the property\u2019s value is in the land. My $1.3M dollar town home was purchased new for $600,000 in 2006. Even at $500 per square foot replacement cost (a number as ludicrous as your attack), that would be $650,000 for the unit itself and the rest the land.\n\nRemoving 50 inches of snow per year is expensive. That is why OP has a $750 per month due in a VHCOL, whereas, my townhome complex could budget zero dollars for snow removal because  it had not snowed in over 30 years.",

That extra $33,000 would have taken us an additional ~6-12 months to save for.  \n\nIf OP had $50,000 ready for a down payment last June but waited until now when they have $100,000 in order to avoid PMI on the same 500,000 list price, their interest rates have gone from [5.09% to 6.79%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US) costing them approximately $60,000 in additional interest over the lifetime of the loans.

For example, let\u2019s say it costs 10k to get rid of PMI, and your loan rate is 7%. That\u2019s 700 a year on that 10k, then add in $75/month ($900 annual), and in effect you\u2019re paying $1600/year on that 10k, effectively having one load at 7% (80% remaining) and another at 16% (10k needed to remove PMI)\n\nIf you can\u2019t pay off the PMI, it\u2019s usually a reasonable amount to fold into your monthly payment, but this process helps me understand how to compare this to a mutual fund that historically (theoretically) returns 10% or something similar.",

But if this was a building built 25 years ago, when you compare it to a condo built as condo 25 years ago, the HOA in the latter has had 25 years to build up reserves, so in 5 years when the roof needs to be replaced, the older HOA has reserves to tap into, while the new HOA will have to ask for money, do assessments, and they may run into quite high territory. \n\nNow this is Boston, so maybe buying into a better funded building might be quite pricey, and you think the discount is worth the possible costs, but you would have to dig into the HOA financials, and estimated repairs they would have to deal with to decide that for yourself.",

However, that seems a bit high for a place that only has a manager there M-F and no amenities like a gym, pool, or parking garage. \n\nAre you prepared for your dues to go up every year? It might be between 3-5%, which will hike your dues up $30-$40 each month. Your property manager gets an annual raise, just like you do.\n\nYour attorney will likely ask the HOA for a budget with reserve figures (because if that elevator ever breaks down, or your building needs a new roof--you don't want to get slapped with a special assessment). Listen to their advice. Also, make sure your homeowners insurance has loss assessment coverage, but most agents already know to put this on condo policies.",

You also have to be prepared to be hit with assessments, which could be sudden depending on the condition of the building. 750 in common charges seems a bit on the high side. Is it a land lease? If so, how many years left on the lease? High monthly charges can result from a number of things so make sure your lawyer thoroughly checks the board minutes to ascertain building is healthy.",

I make $120, she makes $80. After everything (internet, electric\u2014heat and hot water are included) we\u2019re around $3200 a month, combined about $9k take home, and we\u2019re pretty comfortable, despite two hefty student loan bills ($1300 between us). We don\u2019t have regrets about the decision we made, but I think if we were at 7% we\u2019d be a bit more nervous, but we really like the neighborhood and the spot.\n\nI think with the extra wiggle room, you may be able to pay it down more aggressively. I think the biggest takeaway that we\u2019ve both had is that we\u2019re happy enough with the place that we don\u2019t have any real regrets about it, though we realize we probably could have gone about the process a bit better. Things like being more aggressive during the appraisal and the inspection. We had a really knowledgeable agent which helped a lot, though.",

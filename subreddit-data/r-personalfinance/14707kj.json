    "postText": "Without getting to much into it, my mother is in a relatively abusive housing situation. She is currently living with my Grandmother in upstate New York around an hour and a half outside of the city. I am 24 years old and living in one of the major boroughs in the city.\n\n\nMy parents have been divorced since I was 3.5yrs old, and my mom struggled to find work as I was graduating high school and moving into college. She spent a large portion of her savings to stay in our house and try to find a job in the area (around the DC area). She couldn't make it work, so the house is currently being rented and bringing in $500 of gross income per month.\n\n\nShe recently decided she would start taking her social security, amounting to around $1450 / month. Her current savings are around $60-70k, mainly in cash but some investments in a retirement account from when she was a teacher in the public school system.\n\n\nShe needs to move out by August, as her abusive brother is getting evicted and moving in with my grandma as well. As her primary family member, we've discussed selling the house as an option, but it seems like a very bad short term solution.\n\n\nFor context, the house we lived in was purchased for around $120k. The house is valued around $650k now, and there is still $180k on the mortgage. The monthly mortgage payment is $1800. She has around $30k of student loan debt from going back for her master's in her 40s. Car is fully paid off, but near it's last legs.\n\n\nI guess I'm unsure on a few things. Should we try and invest any of her cash that she has, even though she is already 63? Would selling the house and taking profits there to move somewhere else be sustainable for her through end of life care? How should we handle the remaining debt?\n\n\nIt feels like if she could just get a job making $40-45k per year that it would solve a lot, as she's a relatively frugal person, but due to ageism and lack of prospects in the Upstate area, she's been struggling to find work, not for lack of trying.\n\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this. I am just starting to feel overwhelmed as my mother doesn't really have anybody else. I make good money (~90k/yr) but it doesn't feel like enough to just financially support her while also saving myself in the city. I could give her a few hundred per month, which she might not even accept.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses, I'll have to read them in more detail when I get home. I posted before I left the house.\n\n\nSome information: she hasn't been a teacher in over a decade, she was a private school English teacher for a while and then had an IT job that got automated away. After that she got some part time work in management offices doing spreadsheet work basically. Orders, inventory tracking, etc.\n\n\nSelling the house isn't the preferred option for her as its a very emotional subject. I brought it up to her the last time we spoke and she started crying, I think it would make her feel like a failure in some ways. I also think the property would be a good asset for us to keep should I / her ever want to move back. I hear what you all are saying financially though, and it's definitely an option I'm considering more than I was previously when considering the numbers.",

            "comment": "Your mom's money will last a lot longer if she moves somewhere with a low cost of living. She could sell the house in DC and use those funds to purchase an inexpensive condo/ townhome somewhere less expensive, and then live on her Social Security check plus whatever she can bring in from working. \n\nHere's how the math could work:\n\n1. House sells for $650k and she walks away with about $430k after paying off the mortgage and realtor commissions. \n\n2. She pays off her $30k student loan debt and uses $200k or so to buy a condo somewhere affordable but still relatively close to you, like the metro Philadelphia area. \n\n3. She uses $15k for moving expenses, any new furniture she needs, and ends up with $185k remaining from the sale of her home plus the $60-70k in other assets she already has. \n\n4. This money is mostly invested and she tries to leave it alone for the next ten years or so, until her expenses exceed her income and she can't work even a part-time job. Her invested funds may have doubled in that time, giving her $500k in assets to pay for assisted living or whatever in-home healthcare help she needs towards the end of her life.",

She would probably make good money given her background and being her own employer would give flexibility/freedom at age 63 would be valuable.\n\nAlso consider selling her home. The cash flow of $500/month is nice but there\u2019s more headaches to homeownership (eg when something breaks down, bad tenants etc.) that at an older age, she may just not want the hassle of dealing with.",

After capital gains tax, 340k. \n\n&gt; How should we handle the remaining debt?\n\nPay it off.\n\n340k invested in sp500 at 4 percent annual withdraw rate is 14K a year. More than the 6k she was getting from the rental. Probably more because gross does not mean net. \n\nSo now she is getting $2600 a month, tax free because of her tax bracket. \n\nCan she live on that? Where was she planning on living after leaving her mother\u2019s home?\n\nSince she has a masters degree  in presumably education, and presumably is a native speaker of English, online English as a Second Language might be ideal for her.  https://www.teachaway.com/blog/online-teaching-without-experience",

            "comment": "First, I commend you for looking after your mom.  \n\nYour mom should consider selling her house and moving to a lower-cost state.  With the net proceeds of $470K, there are many affordable homes she can buy outright, say around $300K or so, in a cheaper state.  There is a good search tool on Market Watch (affiliated with The Wall Street Journal) to look at new locations.  Some states have no state income tax, low or no property tax for over 65 years old, and/or no tax on retirement income.\n\nRemaining amount, along with her savings, can be invested in HYSA or MMF. If your mom goes this route, be sure to pick a very reputable one like Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab.  These brokerage firms offer check writing/debit card capabilities as well as high yield savings vehicle.  For example, Fidelity's SPAXX has 7-day yield of 4.74%.  And Fidelity has an official Reddit page with good official moderators so you can ask them questions directly. Interest/dividend from this should help with the monthly expenses.\n\nThere is a nationwide shortage of teachers now, so she should look around in various states for employment.  With her educational background, she should be able to find a good paying job.  If she looks online, be sure to practice good security and don't fall for scam jobs.  Depending on the timing of mom getting a job, she may be able to push off getting her Social Security benefits until later date.  The longer she can wait, higher her benefits will be.  If she hasn't already, she can sign up for an online account at ssa.gov to see her benefits at various ages.  Good luck, Kewlrobot.  You and your mom will be all right.",

She might even decide to pay off the student loan debt when the time comes.\n\nAs a teacher, she has all sorts of options. Since she\u2019s moving anyway, she can live anywhere, even overseas for a few years to work as a teacher. Would you want to get a bigger place and have her live with you? That might benefit you both. Are there other reasons she wants to stay in the area she is in now (friends, community activities)?",

For example, I know from relatives who teach in SC, Kansas, and TX that all three are struggling to fill many teaching positions. Many states have reciprocal arrangements that make it easy for certified teachers from other states to switch.\n\nAnother possibility could be signing up for long-term substitute gigs at local school districts or submitting applications indicating an interest in part-time or full-time work. Some schools hire certified teachers to cover maternity leaves, while others discover needs for a part-time teacher at the beginning of the school year.",

            "comment": "I disagree with some of the advice here and agree with others.  \n(Just what you wanted to hear, nothing is easy or simple now, not least of which is trying to give advice to an elder.)  \nShe might have short-term big expenses not noted by others, like HOA fees if she bought a condo. Those fees are ridiculously high now in some places. Plus she needs to make sure she has good health insurance.  \nMedical insurance and medical costs can eat her alive before she turns 65. (They are deductible if more than 7.5% of her gross income.)  \n\n\nIf it's not too late, I'd advise \\*against\\* taking that social security, if she can hold off for another two to five years. If it's from her working years and that amount is not based on a survivor's benefit from a spouse or an ex-spouse's income, her SS should grow nicely in two to five years.  \n\n\nIs she paying for health insurance? That can run $1K+/month on the open market but less if she can keep her income \\*down\\* - she wants to earn \\*some\\* but not too much to lose eligibility for subsidies. Same tactic goes for repayment of student loans - I see no reason under new repayment plans for her to pay it off in a chunk.   \n\n\nTaking a chunk of money from selling the rental house could make her ineligible for health care subsidies and lower student loan repayment options. If she stretches that student loan repayment out long enough, for 20 years, any remaining debt on it could die with her. (She might outlive it of course).  \n\n\nYou said the house is \\*grossing\\* $500 - that's way too low. If it's \\*net\\*, that's another thing.  \n\n\nIf she could move in to the rental house, get a remote good-paying part-time gig that earns her $40K/year until Medicare kicks in in two years, stretch out the student loan repayments, and then reassess after age 65 or 67, the SS income long term will be much better.  \n\n\nIf she's just tired of work and rejection, and taking care of the house - she truly needs to look at remote digital work, with her background. It might be emotionally and financially lifesaving. If a condo near you is most emotionally comforting, then just make sure the HOA costs are included in cost analysis.  \n\n\nIf she can access some of that retirement money now, a decent reliable used car now would be wise. But taking any \\*chunks\\* can hurt with taxes - she should spread out decisions about her financial moves, as well as her payments.",

    "postText": "I have recently been interviewing financial planners to see who would be the best fit for me and my wife.\n\nI spoke with one fiduciary, whom I\u2019ll call X, last month as part of an introductory call and told her that I would love for her to speak with my wife too before we make a decision on hiring X. X said she would be happy to meet with my wife and added that she would also conduct an assessment exercise to give us a sense of whether we should work with her. X then sent a contract, which she asked that we complete before our next call. Along with the contract, X asked us to share our personal financial information with her via RightCapital so that she could make the assessment. When I received the contract (which included information on hourly fees), I thought it was weird that she would ask us to sign it considering we hadn\u2019t hired her yet. I asked her in an email whether signing the contract meant that we were hiring her or whether the contract was intended to just protect our confidentiality. X responded in an email, saying that it did not mean that we were hiring her and that the contract was simply for our confidentiality and so that she could provide advice. \n\nWe ended up signing the contract, even though the contract itself does not note which specific service we had agreed to pay for, and proceeded to do the assessment exercise with X. The exercise was essentially a half hour long conversation about what we should do for the next several months with our finances and how we were not the right fit as her clients right now. X then came back to us with an invoice for nearly $2,000, claiming that she was billing for the 5 hours of work she had done in assessing our finances. \n\nThe thing is \u2026 nowhere in the contract does it state that we would be billed for 5 hours of work (even though there was the option for X to list that figure) nor does the contract mention anything about a price attached to an assessment exercise. Again, we signed the contract under the pretense that she said in her email that it was only for confidentiality purposes and so that she could provide advice. \n\nNow we\u2019re planning to fight the contract since we have a record of her saying the contract was for confidentiality. We were not expecting that the contract meant we had hired her to do an assessment exercise. What should we do?",

There clearly was no defined terms of service or fee schedule for the assessment. \nThat had you known, you likely would\u2019ve interviewed other potential planners. \nX sounds shady AF and I would keep pushing back out of pure principle.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with contractors like that and it\u2019s so annoying on their lack of transparency.",

She sent me a flyer, along with the contract, that notes that she also charges for a one-time financial plan \u2014 and I just realized it\u2019s the same amount as this \u201cassessment exercise.\u201d Essentially, I got charged for a financial plan that she\u2019s been billing as an exercise.",

As I do with all of the financial planners I\u2019ve interviewed, I ask for a sample financial plan to see whether the planner can provide a thorough assessment of a client\u2019s finances. Although I realize that not all planners are willing to provide a sample, I\u2019m surprised X moved ahead under the assumption that I was going to hire her for a service.",

    "postText": "I'm young, and I have no credit. I'm going abroad for 2 months, and I want a credit card with no foreign transaction fees. I can't apply to any because my credit is non-existent, but luckily my mom has one with 0 Foreign Transaction fees that I can become an authorized user of. The only problem is that it's maxed out. My family is fairly well-off, and my mom says that she's starting to pay it off now but that it may reflect negatively on my credit score if I become associated with it. But I need this card otherwise I'll have to pay fees, plus using a debit card abroad is not preferable. What should I do here?\n\nEdit: I have decided **not** to become an Authorized user. Thank you all for the help!",

The parents are pretending to be well off, spending beyond their means and racking up CC debt. This is the opposite of well off and hopefully OP can take this thread, learn from it, and not do the same for themselves. \n\nCredit interest rates are among the worst possible so if the family was using the card as a \u201cloan\u201d this would be incredibly stupid. If they HAD the money they wouldn\u2019t have to slowly pay it off, it would be already paid off.",

As a teen he went on an overseas trip as a group thing and his parents added him as a signer to their CC, which had been opened before he was born. Fast forward, we go to find out what we can be approved for as first time home buyers, and his credit score is nearly 800 despite never having had a credit card! Meanwhile, me and my year-ish old credit card were probably in the upper-600s to low 700s. Had his parents been bad with money, this could\u2019ve ended MUCH differently!\n\nAs a parent myself now, I struggle with whether or not to add my kids to my CC to give them a leg up. One kid I have reservations about due to their lack of maturity and responsibility\u2026 while the other kid I\u2019d (currently) feel more comfortable with doing this, but they\u2019re fresh out of elementary school and their level of responsibility could change quickly. (hubs and my credit scores are upper 700s-low 800s.)\n\nBasically, I don't want to open doors for them if they can't handle the responsibility of using credit responsibly. Getting approved for a $10,000 line of credit can do a lot more damage than a $1,000 line of credit!",

This is\u2026the worst advice that I have seen highly upvoted on this sub in quite a while.\n\nAuthorized users are not legally responsible for the debt on a card.  Ever.\n\nAuthorized user history [does not persist](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/authorized-user-and-primary-cardholder-is-making-late-payments) on your credit report after removal.  After your trip, you can remove yourself as an AU and it will be like it never happened.\n\nThere is *no possible way* for this to have a permanent negative impact on you.  The worst case scenario is a temporary reduction in your credit score.  Unless you plan to buy a house or car on your trip, this doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nYou\u2019ve said this card has enough balance available for your trip, so it sounds like a perfectly reasonable temporary solution.\n\nEveryone moaning that they shouldn\u2019t be carrying a balance is missing the actual question of this post.",

This really seems like your family maybe appears to be well off because they are spending beyond their means.\n5. This tells me that your mom may not actually be paying off this card or that there is a risk of non payment.\n6.  I would not want to be associated with anything like this as a young adult.\n\nThat's solid advice and questions. OP knows nothing about credit, and is about to get involved with their parents who are maxing out cards and are \"well off\". You have no information other than that and all you care about is that there is negligible credit consequences. Have you browsed this forum or ever dealt with people before? You must possibly understand that relationships change over money and how a young adult could be talked into several other rounds of bullshit with their parent if they allow them this \"favor\" over skipping ATM and foreign transactions fee's? Typically 3 fucking percent.  \n\n\nHere's some actual advice OP, you're brand new to this. Finances are a lesson everyone needs to learn. Browse around here, read the sidebar, learn some starting tips on how to establish credit and eat the fee on this trip. If you do not have access to payment methods that avoid fee's or benefit you then understand that you have to take action to access these things. If your family is \"well off\" you should still learn these things, if your family is \"well off\" but actually deep in debt, you should learn these things and avoid getting involved with them personally.",

They were splitting my university tuition, including my year studying abroad, with my grandparents. I never got the slightest hint that they were struggling.\n\nWithin 6 months of me graduating, my parents were separating and getting a divorce. Within a year, before the divorce had finalized, they\u2019d lost the house to foreclosure. My mom had something like $50k in credit card debt because she\u2019d been using her cards to pay her half of the tuition.\n\nMy mom assumed, without looking into it, that I wouldn\u2019t qualify for financial aid because they \u2018made too much money.\u2019 I thought they were well off, so I assumed she was right. Plus they seemed comfortable covering it with the split with my grandparents, so I didn\u2019t ask questions.\n\nShe felt she was doing me a favor by keeping the reality from me that whole time. Instead, I got to process the flood of what ifs and guilt. Should I have picked up on it? What if I could\u2019ve gotten loans and worked through school? Did they need to lose the house? Did the financial strain cause the divorce?\n\nIt was just an incredibly bad way to handle it on her part, and irresponsible of me not to look into it more.\n\nMy point is, if your parents are supporting you still, you may want to dig more into their financial situation to see if they can afford to. Don\u2019t let them turn themselves into martyrs for the benefit of no one.",

Having a bad credit score is worse than having no credit score if you are looking to get credit. With no credit score, you have a \"clean\" file, a new starting point with which to begin your credit journey...and a lot of credit card companies want to take advantage of that. \n\nMy advice - look for a student-oriented card, with no annual fee (and no foreign transaction fees, apparently). Check the \"preapproval\" page to see what they might offer you without doing a hard pull on your credit. Do NOT apply for a bunch of cards (every application dings your credit a little with what they call a \"hard pull\"), be mindful and strategic about what you apply for. \n\nThen: learn the factors that constitute a good credit score and figure out how to maximize them. On-time payments and credit utilization together make up 65% of your score and are important concepts to understand. Make payments on time and in full every month and don't max out your card (or, if you do, expect a hit on your score that month, but its only temporary until you pay it off- utilization isn't something that affects your score long term, just in the month it happens)",

Your \"non\" existing credit will be worse. \n\nAre you going abroad for school? Or pleasure? If school, therr is subsidized school loan you can get and interest will be much lower than CC interest.\n\nWhat is your credit score? Have you applied to any credit card? If it's extremely low, start now with a secured credit card. \n\nDon't be so hung up on foreign transaction fee.. 1-3 percent isn't going to break you. I'll rather have that then have zero transaction fee.. only maybe 500-1k balance on an already used maxed out card that's still being used by your mom lol. \n\nYou're going to get your card declined and mom saying sorry son!

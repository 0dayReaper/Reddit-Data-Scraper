    "postText": "Had a large check stolen and altered then cashed by someone we didn\u2019t write the check to. Unfortunately was about two weeks after it was cashed before it was noticed. \n\nWe immediately contacted bank and are waiting on their fraud department to respond, also filed a police report and reached out to our homeowners to see if this would be covered under our ID theft protection (if it doesn\u2019t work out with the bank), waiting to hear back from them as well.\n\nWhat else should we be doing? How do we ensure we get the bank to deposit the money back in our account? Capital one in case it helps to know.\n\nThanks all",

Are there any signs of tampering with mail?\n\nFor third party handling (if not bank), contact them and let them know what happened so they can investigate, somebody with access may be perpetrating fraud since they have the means (as well as the motive).",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo lately money has been pretty tight for me, I lost my job a few months ago and have been trying to uber full time to keep up payments, but its been an uphill road. Recently I posted on Craigslist attempting to sell my Switch and XboxOne, and made a deal with someone where they claimed they'd be sending me a check in the mail...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when UPS showed up with an envelope I wasn't surprised. However, this check is written by the **Harama Entertainment Corp**, for $1,550. I was only selling the consoles for $450 total. Does anyone have any idea where this could have come from? Is it safe to deposit? The check had no context attached to it, just the oversized UPS express envelope. This seems a little too good to be true...\n\n**UPDATE:** /u/SirGlass hit it right on the money, the buyer wants me to \"hold\" the cash until his \"shipper\" can pick up the Switch and the extra money in the check. I'm shredding the check and relisting my consoles asking for cash only next time. I really was trying to talk myself into thinking this could be my debt relief, but this is clearly a scam. Thanks to everyone for keeping me sane.\n\n**EDIT 2:** For those asking how anyone could fall for a scam like this or even consider it, it's a mixture of desperation and feeling ignorant about banking matters. As a student with bills being automatic and rent going through venmo I didn't immediately see the check as a red flag, just an \"older\" way of paying for things. Also when everyone else was trying to lowball me, this guy offers me the asking price which made me want to deal with him. Honestly if the check had been the exact amount and not $1,100 more I probably would have just went straight to the bank.",

I usually recommended grocery store if asked about this when I was a food service manager because they are well-lit public areas with foot traffic and my employees didn't always live in great areas. Few things are more nerve wracking than cashing a paycheck and holding your next two weeks' of sustenance in your hands all at one time, so do it somewhere safe just for your own peace of mind.\n\nProbably more of an /r/povertyfinance or /r/internetparents snippet but not everyone knows this stuff.",

Needless to say we had about 10 grand in cash on us.  We walked up to the counter and asked again if there was a limit to money orders (it was the simplest way to get cash back to base). They again assured us, no, there was no limit.  We began counting thousand stacks out on the counter with a full line of people behind us in rural Ohio. Only then did the clerk give us a shocked look and say \"we can't do that much!\" We noped the fuck out as fast as we could back to our big yellow truck.",

When you deposit a check you're asking your bank to ask the issuing bank for money and pull it into your account.\n\nMost major banks have automated systems for check processing, but theoretically *any* bank or payment processor with an ABA number is supported, which can potentially include legacy or international banks with a US ABA RTN number. There's nothing to stop them from taking advantage of banks in favorable countries that use old manual systems and take many weeks to respond to the backlog of checks. By the time they find out it's too late, they've already fronted you the money and many people have already spent it.\n\nTheoretically banks have something like 25 business days to delay a check for investigation if they think it's fraudulent.",

                            "comment": "&gt; it's common for banks to mark it as 'cleared' after a few days, then invalidate it weeks later. That's infuriating and should be illegal, but they do it.\n\nYou have that backwards.\n\nBanks are mandated, *by law*, to make the money available within a certain period of time. This is known as the [Expedited Funds Availability Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedited_Funds_Availability_Act), and is why this scam works.\n\nPeople see the money made available in their account and *assume* - incorrectly - that the check/instrument has cleared. It hasn't. The bank is adhering to the law - it *has* to put the money in your account. Scammers take advantage of this mistaken assumption.\n\nThe law was originally passed as a *consumer protection* in the 80's, so the banks couldn't hold your paycheck for days while waiting for the issuing bank to clear it.",

OP cashes a check from Harama Entertainment Corp (which appears to be a real company of some kind - I'm assuming it's not a front, but even if it is, it's not like scammers don't use real companies all the time).  In clearing the check, the only thing the bank knows is whether the account indicated on the check has money in it.  The account number isn't secret.  Any person receiving a check will have access to it.  And any asshole with a printer can print some fake checks.\n\nWhen the check clears, it is debited against the account.  A record of the transaction is provided to the accountholder (generally at the end of the month).  Somebody in the accounts payable department of the accountholder goes through the checks that hit the bank account after they receive the statement.  If they see that the checks written don't match the company's records, they pull the check in question and call the bank to investigate.  When the bank investigates and determines the check is fake, they refund the money.\n\nThat all takes time.  And it's not just possible for it to happen to big faceless corporations.  Someone can just as easily fake a check from your account.  If that happens, how long would you want to discover the check was fake?  In order to give people time, by the a statement is sent and you give people 30 days to investigate, you would need 2 months to clear checks.  That's not practical.",

When I called to report the error, the bank said that that was unfortunate, and the thing I should do is contact the wireless provider immediately...\n\nIn other words, money had been taken out of my account by someone with no authorization to do so, and it was now MY problem to solve.\n\nBut if it's the BANK that gave out its own money, well, that's DIFFERENT. It turns out that that is ALSO my problem (if they gave me money). \n\nSo practicality enters into it, and no, it isn't reasonable to expect the bank to give an immediate clearance, or even necessarily be able to tell in three days. As near as I can tell, however, there is NO amount of time you can wait, and NEVER an assurance from the bank that the funds are really yours. You can never get from a bank that the money they gave you from a check is no longer subject to being clawed back. And that's all right with the banks, anything is all right with them as long as they can always transfer any risk or loss to you. And charge you for things.",

If the check is bad, the bank will simply deduct the funds from *your* account when it becomes clear to them that they can't collect from the bank the check was drawn on.",

            "comment": "I used to work for UPS and had experience dealing with these types of experiences. \n\nThese checks most of the time are delivered in UPS air envelopes which look legit. UPS air envelopes are $$$ to send. Sometimes these scammers use UPS ground envelopes which still cost $$ but still look somewhat legit and both types of envelopes are delivered by UPS drivers.\n\nScammers place a huge stack of these envelopes in UPS drop boxes and sometimes I would receive stacks (30-50) of these envelopes once or twice a week. Each envelope would be addressed for an out of state address. Most drivers will catch them before they get shipped out. BUT there are about 100+ drivers making pick ups every day at a package hub and usually are on a time crunch delivering their own packages so they might not catch these envelopes before the get shipped.\n\nContents of these envelopes contain a fake check that looks very real. Sometimes there will be watermarks on the check or a real bank name. These fake checks are usually in the thousands any where between $1000-$9000. I saw one once for $25,0000! Sometimes there will be a note to contact an email or phone number about the check.\n\nScammers will fine an old company ups shipping account to charge to mail these fake checks. There's lots of investigating involved to prevent this from happening on a regular basis at UPS. There are millions of company accounts UPS has and more created each day so it's not something that can be easily noticeable.\n\nI never opened these types of envelopes but have had some returned already opened. Some of these envelopes were never even sealed like someone just put the check in the envelope and left it like that. So that's how I knew about these fake checks.\n\nI sent whatever I found to UPS fraud department.",

It's 2019, and UPS should at least make it a requirement to generate labels online from said company account.\n\nI did have a UPS account in the past. I once needed to send something, so I signed up, paid and generated a label. \nI didn't know someone could use my account number to send mail. Years later I received a bill for a package a $unfimiliarPerson sent to $unfamiliarCompany. I called the UPS, disputed this (they were totally okay with this), and promptly closed my account.",

But like, I'm turning 32 in a month, and I've literally never needed to write a personal check. Meanwhile, I don't understand why any business would choose to accept checks at all. I know there's fees associated with accepting cards, so I can understand not wanting to deal with that, but if you're in a situation where card fees are too much, surely the risk of bounced checks is also unacceptable?",

They have well established legal rules for dealing with disputes over checks.   Personal apps for transferring money are still the Wild West.\n\nI have a contractor put in $3000 worth work on my house I will happily give them a credit card but many prefer a check because they want to take it to the bank, cash it and pay all the guys who were working the job.\n\nYou want a passport?  Best have a checkbook if you fill out and send in the application yourself.  They don't take Zelle or credit cards.\n\nBut yeah, the time of pulling out a checkbook at the grocery store and filling out a check, is gone even though I do see some older folks still doing it.",

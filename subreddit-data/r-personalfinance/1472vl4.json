    "postText": "I recently opened up a brokerage account at Vanguard. Per normal, I went to set up my bank account for EFTs, and also set up a transaction from said account for once verified. I don\u2019t like connecting anything PLAID to my accounts, so opted for the micro-deposits instead. \n\nThe next day it was showing that amount in my Vanguard account as available to allocate which I thought was odd, but there was no withdrawal from my bank. \n\nDid not receive the micro transactions for another day or so. Another day later I go to my bank to check the amounts to complete the verification, and the whole amount for the post-verified transfer has already been transferred. WTF??\n\nThis was late evening and went to call to find out they don\u2019t have 24/7 service, no live chat, nothing. So sent a secure message explaining what had happened (fuming). Telling them to reverse the transfer (I couldn\u2019t because even after entering the test amounts they wanted to do more verification (the irony))and got a generic response completely ignoring everything I said and telling me to call in. \n\nReplied back even more annoyed asking for it to be escalated, etc. all I got was yet another generic email saying the same thing. That was the end of the week and of course they aren\u2019t open on weekends, so\u2026\n\nAnyway, posting this for a few reasons\u2026.to warn others as apparently they can pull money out of your account without vetting that the account is mine, yet they can\u2019t let me deposit into the same account. \n\nSecondly to ask if anyone has a telephone number or email for some type of escalated customer service team for when I try and reach out tomorrow?\n\nGoing to switch to Fidelity who wouldn\u2019t transfer before verification and they24/7 phone support. Slightly lower interest on their money market account, but would rather make less interest for better security and service.",

            "comment": "So, if I'm understanding your post, you opened an account at VG, linked an existing bank account from VG website, then pulled microdeposits from bank account to VG.  You did not get any notification from VG on the status of microdeposits.  Only when you checked the account yourself, you saw not only did the microdeposits transfer but the entire bank account amount, which you did not give instructions to do so.  If this is true, then I would be very concerned.  I would call CS right away.  Start with the main number and escalate from there.  Maybe you accidentally turned on a feature to auto transfer after linking?  Maybe this is how VG's linking on new accounts work?  Maybe there is a good explanation that was missed.  I would also ask why there were no notifications from VG.  Unfortunately, I don't think VG has branch offices you can physically go to.",

                    "comment": "Close. I did authorize a transfer for once the security verification had completed. But they pulled the money before I submitted the micro deposit amounts. That is still a problem for me. \n\nI called them and they said that it came out because the verification is \u201conly for withdrawals\u201d and they do that because they wanted to \u201cmake my money immediately available to spend in the market\u201d. \n\nI asked them what checks they do before pulling that money (considering it\u2019s initiated from their end and not my bank) and sounds like it\u2019s just confirming that the name matches. At least the rep I spoke with couldn\u2019t articulate anything else. \n\nSo, obviously I asked what happens if the money isn\u2019t there when they go to pull it or there is another problem and I\u2019ve already allocated those funds. They said that they can pull it back with 7 or 10 days, which to me is just ridiculous (and about to be ironic).\n\nAnd while it might be a stretch, if I have a common name and get ahold of someone else\u2019s bank account info and set up a withdrawal, then what? Someone is going to have a really bad day. And obviously someone else could do this to me.\n\nWhether this is all normal for them or not, I was/am not happy. So, I went to withdraw my money and couldn\u2019t. The system said that I needed to complete the micro deposit confirmation first. So again, you can take my money without verification but can\u2019t put it back without it??!!\n\nAnyway, I did that, went back and it then told me that it\u2019s still vetting the security of my account and that they would be in touch once it was completed. \n\nI called them and complained. The rep was talking to me like I was an idiot. \u201cBut you initiated the transfer\u201d\u2026\u201dyes, but from Vanguard\u2019s end and with the understanding that you would verify my bank account first\u201d. Asked them why I can\u2019t withdraw my money since verifying the deposits and they say that I have to wait 7 days for security checks, yet when I asked what those were, they had no idea. \n\nThen they spout off the typical \u201cit\u2019s policy\u201d\u2026no, you took my money no issue and now you are holding it despite me validating the requirement. I asked to speak with a supervisor and the rep refused \u201cbecause they are going to tell you the same thing\u201d... I asked several more times and they finally relented though of course they\u2019re not actually available/have to wait 49 hours for a call back.\n\nSo in short, crap security/they only care about hurting your liner in and make you jump through hoops to get it out, and service is horrible and has limited availability. They\u2019ve lost my business for ever.",

This is good to know about VG.  It is not unusual for financial firms to wait 7-10 days on new accounts.  And be careful if you do end up transferring out because firms are very touchy about new accounts and the last thing you need is if VG locks/freezes your account.  Good luck.",

            "comment": "Try paying a utility bill or credit card bill with ACH transfer. Some require you to verify your linked bank account. Some don't. Vanguard belongs to the latter camp. The rationale is you can't move the money out until your linked bank account is fully verified. They can also reverse the transactions on their end if the ACH transfer ends up failing or the ACH account name comes back mismatched. \n\nThey chose to trust users a little bit more.",

I\u2019ve never heard of a company like this NOT verifying, but why bother if you aren\u2019t gonna wait till verification is completed. Fidelity couldn\u2019t process anything either way until that occurred.",

Are your funds there, they haven\u2019t disappeared right? Are you able to withdraw them are you able to contribute more? Can you trade with these funds? Are you able to link a bank belonging to someone else with someone else\u2019s name and do all these actions with it? I bet if you try you\u2019ll come across a message that says this bank isn\u2019t authorized something doesn\u2019t match and to submit a bunch of documentation. And even if you don\u2019t I know for a fact they send a copy of the action by mail and message center quickly, letting you know an account has been added or removed. You\u2019re not even sure how their system operates before calling it a security issue. \n\nObviously it\u2019s secure, how else would they have over 8 trillion in assets under management. Do you hear a lot of stories of them/ or accounts at vanguard being hacked? I haven\u2019t. You gotta relax man.

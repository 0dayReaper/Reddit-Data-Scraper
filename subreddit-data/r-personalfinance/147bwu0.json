You seem not quite comprehend what your generous grandpa has given. While most people struggle paying a bank or a landlord thousands of USD every month and agreeing to *anything* at their workplace only not to lose a job and relocate under a bridge, you have a luxury to spend $300-500/mo in utilities. The rest you earn is your disposable income. Why would you risk your relatively relaxed life for a glimpse of different future? Having a fully paid-off house with minimal expenses you have a luxury to allocate more resources to investing **and** maintaining the security of your house.\n\n&gt;maybe I could invest that money in the stock market and triple or quadruple it and be set?\n\nOnly if you know foreign markets. The best period of returns in American history and the most prolonged bull market was the period of 2009-2021. Adjusted for inflation S&amp;P500 CAGR was 13.85%, 440% total for a period. By far it is not a norm. I highly doubt that my generation (40y-olds) will see similar decade-long real returns on US market again.\n\nI understand the attraction of HYIP but it's *literally* gambling. Do not allocate more than 3-5% of your nest egg to gambling, with windfall money \"better to be safe than sorry\" is the rule of thumb.",

This means that just by owning the house and keeping up with maintenance, your wealth will increase.\n\nInflation is when money becomes less valuable. If you put that money from the mortage in the bank, you will actually *be losing wealth,* because that money's value will go down over time (and it will go down a lot in the short term because inflation is high right now). On top of that, you will also owe a lot in interest on the mortgage because interest rates are also high right now.\n\nSo your big idea is to take something that is pretty much guaranteed to give you more wealth, and turn it into things (a high interest loan, cash in a savings account, and a car) that are guaranteed to give you less wealth. \n\nThis is a really horrible idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;or maybe I could invest that money in the stock market and triple or quadruple it and be set?\n\nAll signs point to a sizable recession coming. \n\nYou want to take your house that is completely paid for, turn it into a mortgage with a high interest rate to get yourself some cash, and then put that cash into a market that is in real danger of crashing?\n\nWith all due respect...

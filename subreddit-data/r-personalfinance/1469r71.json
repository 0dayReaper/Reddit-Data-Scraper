    "postText": "In a sticky position in my personal life and as far as I know this is the LAST option, no friends/family or lenders will take me. \n\n27 years old, been working for a year and a half, my 401k is about $7k. I believe I can only borrow 50%, which is exactly what I need - $3k.\n\nI have two main concerns. One being whether or not my boss and/or HR will be made aware of the loan, the other being how I\u2019ll repay the loan. If I have to repay it like any other debt then I might not do it, but if I\u2019m able to repay it with my normal 401k contributions and I won\u2019t notice any differences, then I\u2019ll be more willing to accept.\n\nAnybody know the answer to these two questions? Or does it depend on the company/bank/benefits program the company uses? \n\nIdeally I\u2019d take a loan without my boss finding out and be able to repay it through my regular 401k paycheck contributions so I don\u2019t miss a thing in the short term.\n\nI\u2019m open to other solutions for funds, though I\u2019m fairly certain I\u2019m out of options\u2014 530 credit score, several creditors in collections, and in a jail-or-freedom possibly life-or-death situation here.",

Whether or not anyone in HR actually cares or blabs to boss is another question.\n\n&gt; then I\u2019ll be more willing to accept.\n\nNot quite understanding the distinction here.\n\nYou can choose to pay it off \"like any other debt.\"  And generally it's set up to be repaid through your paychecks.\n\n&gt; without my boss finding out \n\nFor some reason, a lot of people think they need to appear like they have zero financial struggles.\n\nYour boss likely doesn't care.\n\nAnd if your boss cares, there's a chance that your boss may want to help you rather than further put you down.\n\n&gt; so I don\u2019t miss a thing in the short term.\n\nThis means you are completely not acknowledging one of the greatest downsides to a 401k loan.  Missing out on \"short term\" growth.\n\n&gt; Any other solutions for funds are accepted\n\nWrite out a budget.\n\n* Income\n\n* Expenses.  Every single one.",

Getting downvoted to shit here, but I actually have extremely frugal financial practices, I only make ~$3.6k a month and save almost $1k a month while living in Orange County, CA.\n\nThe debt is from an extreme situation that happened almost three years ago involving the death of a loved one, and essentially I had to bear responsibility for their debts (so thank you everyone for the condescending comments/downvotes). I did make some poor decisions in trying to resolve the debt over a year ago, but long story short I NEED $3k by weeks end. \n\nI think I\u2019m going to take the loan, as your comments made me feel more comfortable IF my boss did find out. I don\u2019t see why they\u2019d be upset, and if anything they might try to help.",

            "comment": "&gt;whether or not my boss and/or HR will be made aware\n\nAt minimum, it's a near certainty a particular group in your HR has *access* to the information, as they have access to everything about every employee's 401k. At most, it's possible (plan specific) your HR may need to rubber stamp the request before the loan goes through.\n\nYour boss doesn't have direct access to your 401k information. HR is supposed to keep your information confidential. In most companies HR just sees you as a data point, unless there's personal politics involved then HR really has no reason to tell your boss.\n\n&gt;how I\u2019ll repay the loan. If I have to repay it like any other debt then I might not do it, but if I\u2019m able to repay it with my normal 401k contributions and I won\u2019t notice any differences, then I\u2019ll be more willing to accept.\n\nIt's an extra payment deducted from your paycheck, on top of your existing contributions. Bear in mind you can reduce your 401k *contributions* at any time. You also lose time in the market when you take a loan.\n\nThe loan deduction also a *fixed* *expense*. No matter what other future hardships you may face, you cannot reduce the loan payment or delay it, they take it from your paychekc automatically. If you leave the job for any reason, the outstanding balance could become taxable plus a 10% penalty.",

            "comment": "Weirdly enough, I was just in a meeting with HR over an employee I supervise and this came up. She had asked for an enormous salary increase and I was campaigning for us to meet her close to it. The HR person showed me one of her paystubs to show that she was paying back two 401k loans and still contributing a lot to her 401k and maybe that\u2019s why she was so unhappy with pay. I thought it was super shitty of her to show me that information. For whatever this is worth, I firmly categorized that information away in my brain under \u201cNot My Business\u201d and it made me think very poorly of the HR person.\n\nAll to say - possible an HR person would be petty about it. Hopefully your boss (and the HR person) wouldn\u2019t care.\n\nGood luck.",

For example, my neighbor has a friend who got into financial issues...and he had to be very careful because he worked in security at a Casino.\n\nTaking a 401k loan doesn't mean you're in debt already -- it *could* mean, for example, that you need to buy something and don't have the cash.\n\nI like u/BastidChimp's advice to try to pay off the debt more slowly first.  If you must, cut off 401k contributions while you do that.\n\nOr is this a debt that's not on time...it needs to be paid immediately?\n\nMy understanding is most 401k loans are paid by payroll deduction.  You'd have to look at your 401k plan documents to know exactly how they work...  or you'd need to ask HR.",

There are YouTube videos that have extensive information on these two methods. Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

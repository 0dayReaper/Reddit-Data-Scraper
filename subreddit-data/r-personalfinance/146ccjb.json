    "postText": "\\*\\*TL;DR\\*\\*: Getting put on PIP, laid out 3 potential scenarios, have nearly 3 months saved ($10,000 / $3,341per month expenses) and hoping for thoughts and feedback.\n\nHi, I was notified that myself and others on my team will be pushed to a 4 week performance plan. If the requirements are not met we will be terminated with a severance package of a minimum of 2 - 4 weeks of pay based on tenure.\n\n**For context**, I live in the very high cost of living state of Massachusetts and currently earn $96,000/year with a *decent* amount of job opportunities locally in the major metro area in and around Boston. I have **no debts of any kind** or other household members to consider.\n\nBased on reconfiguring my bills and habits today, my fixed bills (rent, electric, internet, phone, car insurance), and before any severance or unemployment dollars, I have nearly 3 months of runway to find a new role with the $10,000 saved. If I manage to save the maximum $1,000 of the last 2 paychecks, I should in theory have a total of 3.5 months.\n\n|Expense|Avg. Amount|\n|:-|:-|\n|Rent|$1,625|\n|Food|$1,100|\n|Fixed Bills|$300|\n|Health|$120|\n|Home|$100|\n|Coffee|$30|\n|Public Transit|$40|\n|Gas|$26|\n|Subscriptions|$0|\n|Electronics|$0|\n|Clothes|$0|\n|Travel|$0|\n|Auto|$0|\n|Total|$3,341|\n\nI have laid out 3 potential scenarios that could play out and am personally leaning towards option A. Open to feedback and would appreciate any and all advice.\n\n**Most likely - Option A)**\n\nAgree to PIP, save $800-$1,000 from the last 2 paychecks to increase my emergency savings. Do my best and attempt to hit the marks needed while at the same time be disciplined in applying and interviewing for a better or comparable role within a 3 month time span.\n\n**Somewhat likely - Option B)**\n\nAgree to the PIP, save $800-$1000 from my potential last 2 paychecks to increase my estimated 3 month emergency savings. Maintain my workload and \u201ctry\u201d to hit the mark, but focus more effort during the workday to apply and interview.\n\n**Least likely - Option C)**\n\nDeny PIP, take the severance package and focus all effort in landing an offer in less than 3 months.",

            "comment": "If you get the same severance either way, then just use the PIP period to give yourself more runway for the job search. Some other important context is why you\u2019re on the PIP in the first place. Is this your fault, where you know you can reasonably turn it around if you get yourself together, or is this just a pretext for layoffs, where there\u2019s really nothing you can do?",

The role I am in lacks large amounts of structure and changes within the day or hour. Could I *maybe* turn it around? If I worked 45-55 hours the next few weeks. I think this a scenario of give the world and they'll want the moon. I think the path is clear that I need to buy time and move on and get out of the environment.\n\nI was forced to change jobs within my organization 3 times due to 2 rounds of layoffs and reorganization efforts. There has been an undertone from management that every middle manager needs to pick some or several to PIP in order to avoid another layoff event. I am that one. By hook or by crook. \n\nThanks for your advice. I appreciate it.",

One key takeaway from this ordeal could be analyzing how you can prevent this from happening in the future, or take steps to stop the degression earlier in the process. \n\nBtw, is this a part time gig? 45-55 hours/week is not unordinary for upper level salary staff.",

Do your best to live frugally until you can get another position.\n\nRemember that you only need to meet the shortfall between jobs or the potential reduced salary with that emergency fund.  So if you can get a decent job (that may not pay as much as you were making) that is better than $0 and you only need to keep it until the next job.\n\nI sweated this alot when I lost my job (zero notice and immediate) but in the end I only didn't make $5000 after changing jobs and getting back up to where I was.   So my emergency fund was more than enough.\n\nGood luck!",

Your gas budget is probably low, you\u2019ll need to drive to interviews. Also plan on spending on job search expenses, resumes, better quality paper for printing. \n\nPart of my severance was a job search consultant. He introduced me to a very systematic approach to target companies, i.e. if you have very specific skills and you see one of your target companies hiring for any position, get a cover letter and resume to their HR. That way you\u2019re not competing with 200 other applicants",

COBRA would cost much more and I'm not familiar with how much a plan through MassHealth would cost since I'm not in MA.",

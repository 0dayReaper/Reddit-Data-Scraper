    "postText": "I've been a renter my entire adult life. I'm currently under contract with a home, and trying to do some calculations on how to visualize my cost of living for the next few years. Could someone with better financial knowledge help me understand this?\n\n### Purchase Data\n\n| House Cost | Down Payment (25%) | Closing Costs | Interest Paid | Yearly Property Tax (Hypothetical Average) | Total Property Tax | Yearly Insurance (Hypothetical Average) | Total Insurance | Home Improvement Costs | Repairs | Months to Pay Off Mortgage | Years |\n|------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------|----------------------------|-------|\n| $334,000   | $83,500            | $5,000        | $70,000       | $6,500                                    | $60,125            | $5,000                                | $46,250         | $15,000                | $30,000 | 111                        | 9.25  |\n\n\n* Note: The asterisk () in the \"Months to Pay Off Mortgage\" column indicates that extra principal payments were made to reduce the total interest paid and the life of the loan.\n\n### Monthly \"Cost of Living\" Rent vs Own\n\nMy calculation is attempting to determine **what the average rent would need to be over the next 9.25 years** for me to have been financially neutral to rent.\n\n    Monthly Cost = (Total Cost - (Purchase Price * Profit Modifier)) / Months to Pay Off Mortgage\n\n * Total Cost refers to the sum of all expenses incurred over the life of the loan, including the initial purchase price, interest paid, property tax, insurance, home improvement costs, and repairs.\n * Purchase Price represents the original price at which the home was bought.\n * Profit Modifier is a factor that accounts for the profit made when selling the home. For example, a value of 1.1 corresponds to a 10% profit, while a value of 1.2 corresponds to a 20% profit.\n * Months to Pay Off Mortgage is the duration in months taken to pay off the mortgage.\n\nBy subtracting the profit portion (calculated as the purchase price multiplied by the profit modifier) from the total cost, we obtain the net cost. Dividing this net cost by the number of months to pay off the mortgage gives an estimate of the monthly cost.\n\n**Monthly \"cost of living\" chart**\n\n| Total Cost over Life of Loan | If You Make Zero Profit (Same Sale Price) | If You Make 10% Profit | If You Make 20% Profit |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| $560,375                    | $2,039                                    | $1,739                | $1,438                |\n\n\n\nAm I missing anything?",

            "comment": "I honestly don't even understand most of this at all....and I'm not looking to have it explained to me. I just wanted to point out that your repairs/improvement amounts may need to be increased unless everything is new &amp; under warranty. We've been in our house for 7.5 years. In that time, we've replaced the roof, the furnace, a broken window, the sump pump, washer &amp; dryer, refrigerator, a deep freeze, and the stove. That's just the big stuff. It has well surpassed $10,000. We DIY most home improvement stuff like remodeling, flooring, painting, cabinets, etc - but with all the projects we've done I'd say we're about $10,000 in on that side already, too. Not including the necessary tools to do said projects. I hope someone else who understands your equations has answers you were looking for. Definitely consider upping the repairs total, though. Better to be prepared &amp; not need it.",

            "comment": "What you are missing: risk analysis\n\nThe financial calculations have a wide range of potential variance. Instead of using a single projected value you should create a few different models for best case, medium case, and worst case; then weigh how good the best case would be against the worst case and medium case to see if you'd be comfortable with the total risk profile.  You already did something like this with home sale price, you should also include a similar matrix for additional major repairs and deviations in potential increases in rent prices.\n\nAlso your income matters a lot for this kind of analysis.  Paying off your mortgage in 10 years saves you a lot in potential interest but destroys you in liquidity in case unexpected major expenses come up (maybe related to the house, maybe a medical issue, maybe a family emergency, etc.).  If you are making healthy contributions to retirement accounts and cash savings in addition to extra principal this is no problem, but if you are planning to allocate the majority of your potential savings income into home equity it leaves you very exposed to the risk of having to take out additional loans with worse interest rates than your mortgage would have been.",

I personally have savings that exceed the cost of the home, so I considered that before deciding to purchase.\n\nThere are also risks with renting that could become a financial issue.\n\n&gt;The financial calculations have a wide range of potential variance\n\nYeah I think what I can do for the moment is make the tax/insurance estimates a little smarter. I can look up the current tax bill on the county website - and then find out the average year-over-year tax increase. Then I wouldn't really need to guess an average. Same with insurance.",

I live alone and enjoy the places I've lived. \n\nHowever I'm pretty sure it will be difficult to live alone for $2,000/month as I approach 9.25 years from now. So in the negative case that I make 0 profit on the home sale, I still think I'm coming out ahead (given that my \"guesses\" on repairs/tax/etc are close to realistic).\n\nBut it's not really looking like some huge financial benefit, but then again this gets better the longer I live in the home.",

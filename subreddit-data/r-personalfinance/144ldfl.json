    "postText": "I\u2019m getting set up with payroll for my summer internship this week at a startup. \n\nThe accounting department requested that I enroll through a bill.com invite and file a W9. They sent me an email with this request, and said to let them know if I have questions. I thought interns aren\u2019t usually private contractors, so I responded with the following: \n\nMe: \n\n\u201cI'm not really sure what a W9 entails, could you please clarify for me?\nI'm looking into how I'd be paying my taxes, but I'm confused because I thought since I'm an paid intern, I would just be filing a W4? Thank you so much for your help!!\u201d\n\nThey responded:\n\n\u201cAll good questions - I'm attaching a copy of a fillable IRS W9 form for you to fill out and send back. \n\nYou are being paid as an independent contractor rather than a company employee, which means instead of a W4 you will fill out a W9. At the end of the year, you will receive a 1099 to file with your taxes, rather than a W2. The process is similar when it comes to filing your tax return, but as a 1099 employee you will not have taxes withheld from your weekly pay and will instead pay any taxes owed upon filing your 2023 tax return.\n\nIf you would like any further clarification, please feel free to ask! \u201c",

They cannot set hours, require uniforms (or enforce any dress codes), require you to attend meetings, etc. It would be nearly impossible to classify any trainee as an independent contractor because by the virtue of you training them you are exerting control over the manner the work is being done.",

Furthermore, a paid intern who will work for your company for no more than 90 days may not be eligible for group health insurance coverage, depending on how the applicable plan documents define the initial waiting period.\u201d\n\nFwiw. https://www.justworks.com/blog/so-you-want-to-pay-your-interns-a-guide-to-paid-internships",

    "postText": "I recently picked up a part-time seasonal position at Macy's for some extra holiday cash. I've been working in retail off and on over the past 15 years, and am familiar with the hiring and management practices at a lot of places, but it's been a few years since I've worked for a big retailer like Macy's. I was very surprised and disappointed to learn that the 20% employee discount  is only available through a prepaid card (like a gift card I guess, not terrible but not great), or through their *actual store credit card*. They conveniently inform you of this halfway through your new hire paperwork, and even allow you to apply right then and there.\n\nI've been through this type of application process before, but I've never seen something so brazenly unethical. These are often young adults or older people applying for these positions, filling out so many forms with so much corporate legalese that your head would spin, and they're being targeted with a (hard hit, thanks auto mod) hit to their credit for a card with a ridiculous interest rate. Is this new in retail? Seems like a disturbing trend if it is.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts on this? Just wanted to get the word out.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the replies, everyone. Really enjoyed the discussion about credit cards, business practices, and obviously PF. The consensus seems to be that store credit cards are not any worse than other forms of lending, as long as they are managed responsibly. I respectfully disagree, in that it seems like they are often offered to a range of people (namely, new employees) that may not have the knowledge or experience to handle a line of credit, but I will agree that it's fair game to solicit employees. I just think it's kind of shady to imply that a store credit card is an \"easy\" solution for employees. Employees should just get an effing discount, period. But we're all free to work and shop where we please, so feel free to support smaller/local businesses that don't subject their customers and employees to frivolous lending situations.",

This wasn\u2019t some extra perk or employee discount, this was doled out instead of actual money from hours worked. \n\nOf course this was omitted during the hiring process and several dozen hours of unpaid online \u201ccourse work\u201d so as to learn the product better. \n\nNeedless to say I was beyond pissed come payday. \n\nBoss: \u201cHere is your $300 gift card\u201d\n\nMe: ???\n\nBoss: \u201cYou can redeem it at many^* major retailers like certain Walmart locations!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cCan I use it to pull out cash?\u201d\n\nBoss: \u201cNo\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cCan I buy gas with it?\u201d\n\nBoss: \u201cNo\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cCan I pay rent with it?\u201d\n\nBoss: \u201cNo\u201d\n\nAmazingly, employee turnover was about one pay-period long. As it turns out, people prefer to be compensated for labor with currency rather than a worthless fucking pile of gift cards that were seemingly only redeemable at the company website.

Late 90's, early '00s, back when Best Buy was king, if my product had an issue, I could drag my happy ass to the store and they'd replace it quickly, with a smile. If there was a newer version of that product, they'd just tell me to go grab it instead. It was great.\n\nThen their products got shittier and the warranties were less profitable. They threw anchors in the return process and it became awful to try and get something fixed or replaced. I once bought a new computer that had issues within the week with it's hardware. Long story short: I knew more than the Geek Squad people, but all they could do was reformat my harddrive before sending it away to California to get fixed... Where they just reformatted my harddrive... So I just kept taking it in until they HAD to replace it, but the whole process left me without a computer while I was in college for 3 months.\n\nThen the internet happened and they were surprised when their stock tanked. Yes, when an industry/company that everyone hates is no longer the only game in town, that industry/company dies, as it should.\n\nThe moment we have an alternative to air travel... Oh boy, that will be a good day.",

A lot of the people in the store were not native speakers and in the chaos of the long checkout lines it seemed really predatory to be goading people into credit cards. I think they were offering $20 off your purchase. This was extra shady considering sears is about 5 minutes from going under. ",

When people are in long lines they could give two shits about a store credit card, most just wanna get out of the store. But with my manager leaning over my shoulder asking why I didn't ask them for a store card I had to occasionally stop the line for like 10 minutes to help people sign up. \n\nMeanwhile I get to deal with the meanest fucking looks and attitudes from the people who are waiting. Exactly why I stopped even asking about those cards and ended up getting reprimanded multiple times for it. ",

Batteries, screws, pillow cases, whatever.  \n\nI went in one day, picked up a pack of AA batteries, and got in line.  Right then, I had to pee.  The cashier pitched every customer ahead of me (only cashier on duty) the card and warranties.  Every customer said no, and he took his sweet time bagging up their stuff so that he could talk up the intro rate and what not.  Everyone in line got angrier every time he did this (maybe 7 or 8 in line other than me).  I got to the front and felt like my bladder was going to explode.  I told him as I handed him my batteries, \"I heard your pitch 10 times now.  I don't want it.  Ring me up.\"  The dude gave me a dirty look and said, \"well if you don't want to save money...\"  \n\nThat was the third time in a row that I had to listen to never ending pitches for credit cards, and I never shopped there again.  I'm really glad that store is now empty.   ",

I mean HDMI cables are common, right? \n\nWe had to wander through this huge empty store all the way to the back to find the electronics section. The light bulbs were burnt out in that area so it was pretty dim and gave the whole area this really creepy vibe. We saw like two people the whole time we were in the store and they were employees hanging out near The washing machines. \n\nThe electronics section consisted of three shelves of random remote controls, batteries and (I shit you not) a copy of the Sims 2 that looked like it had been opened already. Oh and a metric ton of blank cds. No HDMI cables to speak of, nothing even remotely useful really.\n\nI ended up going online and using the gift cards to buy from some 3rd party sellers. Never going to set foot in another Sears so long as I can help it.",

So it wasn't a store thing, as a whole sears would make employees come in early on a Saturday or Sunday for credit card training sessons, aka detention. \n\nFuck them and their strategy team who act like the demise of sears is in the hands of their revolving sales staff.  I bailed pretty quick but have all the respect for the people I worked with who were some of the best I've met in retail. You don't see that walking into the store though, just brainwashed parrots trying to avoid punishment when yet another quarter closes at a loss. Did I mention Fuck sears?",

I work for Best Buy which is very focused on credit card applications, award account sign ups, protection plans, genetic makeup reviews, first born child assimulation, etc.. but as far as I know, no one would ever use a new employee's info to do an app under the pretense of training. I have seen people \"snipe\" credit apps from the new guys i.e. run the app under the older employees numbers but have the new guy actually fill out the app for you but never something...so fucked up.\n\nWhy aren't they using training mode on POS?  Do the managers even care or know?Also, at Best Buy we are required by law to supply the applicant with the terms and conditions of the credit card before the application process starts. Idk if that is the same at other companies but I can't imagine it being much different. If the new guy is tricked into applying and never received the terms and conditions, is there a law being broken?",

I think their only client was Sprint + Sprint MVNOs.\n\nThere were so many red flags that I just stopped going before the end of the training, the biggest of which was that they paid employees on pre-paid debit cards. These \"debit\" cards had additional ATM fees, no free ATMs, and a deal with the Safeway across the street where the only place you could \"cash\" your checks was there. So if you wanted your money in a bank like a fucking normal member of society you had to go to the Safeway money order desk and get your entire check in cash, then take it to a bank to deposit in cash.\n\nThey also had local restaurants come in every day to cater lunch. The price of the meals were actually more than just going to the fucking restaurants. And conveniently they had a system where you could eat and it would just deduct the money from your paycheck. This entire place built from the ground-up to extract money from their employees after paying them.\n\nThey had an insane badge-based security system and one day I forgot my badge. I started to walk into the office to get a temp badge when I just decided there was no point as this wasn't going to work out. I just drove off and never went back. They sent me a couple of threatening letters about returning my badge. I'd already thrown it in the trash so I ignored them. They were out of business less than two years later.",

Bottom level retail employees are in the job of getting customers to spend more money; management is in the job of persuading employees to spend more money.  Obviously the employee discount encourages this and it's a great tactic while still rewarding your employees, but I wouldn't be surprised if district managers have meetings and send out notices about getting employees to spend more.

Even tourists visiting from out of country folks. Although you can say there's no harm since those people don't have or need established credit history in the states. But still, it's unethical af. ",

My old company gave a colleague card that gets scanned to apply the discount but you still charge whatever credit card you wanted.\n\n\nOne reason I thought of to move towards applying discounts through a company credit card was that the colleague card can get passed around amongst friend and families with low risk. I wouldn't dare give my credit card away unless its my parents or brother. Basically, people I have full trust in not in.\n\n\nThere's also a potential cash flow benefit to the company as the partner (ie. MC/Visa) will be paying your company the full amount in a day or so, while you pay the discounted amount a month or so down the line. That's how mine works anyway.\n\n\n\nRegarding the interest, I assume it's the same as a non colleague's interest rate. If so, that's a different discussion.\n\n\n\nHope this helps.",

Then when I got a full time job I paid off my red card and cut it up, mainly so I wouldn't use it for something then forget to pay it. Well about 2 weeks after I paid it off they added some sort of fee to my card, something like $3. I didn't know they did this as I had put the card completely out of my mind. Sure I got crap in the mail from them, but it didn't look any different from any previous junk they had ever sent me, it all went straight it the trash because none of it looked important. Well after not paying for 60 days, the total after interest and late fees was a whopping $7.xx and they sent it to collections and it went against my credit. It's fallen off my credit now, but it still makes me bitter to think about and I hate getting asked if I want to sign up for their cards every time I shop there. ",

They used to do you a \"favor\" of holding transactions and then reordering them from largest to smallest before applying them to you balance. When I called to ask why in the hell with they do that, they said \"it ensures the big and important transactions go through and don't get declined\", but in reality it was so that they could get 6 overage charges instead of one if it were to be in chronological order. I had one time where I would have been over by 10$ but instead I got 6 overage charges because they applied small credit transactions I did earlier in the week last. So -45$ turned into -220$.\n\nI was a poor college kid and the time, I'm no longer in that situation but never again BofA...",

You know all of those exclusions on coupons that everyone loves to complain about?  You know, no discounts on Nike, Polo, North Face, etc.?  Those aren't because Macy's likes to play hardball, they're in place because of the contracts department stores have with the vendors whose products they sell.  Those vendors have specific pricing stipulations in place that say \"our products are premium, and we don't want their value to be questioned by allowing them to go on sale.  Therefore, you can't sell our products for anything less than what we say you can sell them for, or we just won't let you sell them.\"  The general population wants those products, so Macy's has an incentive to keep the vendors happy by agreeing to those rules.  Target (I used to work for them as well) had the same issue with Apple, which is why you always see gift cards instead of discounts on Black Friday.\n\nSo how does this tie into employee discounts?  Well, Macy's can either say your discount has the same exclusions as all the coupons they send out, which would suck for everyone, or they can come up with a workaround, which they did in the form of those credit cards.  If you use their credit card, they can sell you the merchandise at full price, making the vendors happy, and then go back and give you a 20% credit on everything you buy on the back end, making employees happy.\n\nIt's definitely playing with fire for people that can't handle paying off their cards every month, but it's really the only way they can do things that meshes with their business model.",

I know how sticky that kind of stuff can get; even as a supervisor, I've had several headaches because of competing brands wanting their own price points, spots on the sales floor, etc. So Macy's see this as a win-win: streamline a TON of things at once, and maybe make a little interest on the side. They're certainly not offering credit services as a customer convenience, they're trying to make a profit. But employee discounts have traditionally been a perk of working somewhere, not a double-edged credit sword. Thank for the reply.",

They all loved it.  \n\nAnother big advantage (not sure if this has been covered already or not) was the employee discount could be used in conjunction with sales, coupons and other discounts.  The extra 20% off an already nice sale or coupon price was just icing on the cake.  These guys also knew the best times to take advantage of this.  \n\nIt was also hassle free since the cashier had no idea if they were employees since the discount was applied on the backend on the card after the sale.",

Virtually all MAP pricing policies have stipulations that state re-sellers *can* sell items below MAP, they just cannot formerly advertise those prices. In addition, when it comes to selling items online, item pages must list the price at MAP or above; however, once a shopper adds the item to their shopping cart, the selling price can be changed below MAP if they so wish.

We have a 30% employee discount with practically no stipulations or limits (other than not re-selling for profit of course) and are allowed, encouraged even, to share said discount with family and friends...

                    "comment": "I believe what you are referring to is UMAP (Unilateral Minimum Advertised Price). It restricts retailers like Macy\u2019s from displaying sale items below the designated pricing and keeps the marketplace competitive - this is where you would see something like \u201cAdd to bag to see price\u201d. Technically Macy\u2019s and others set their own retail prices, so for example you might see a shirt at $35.99 one place, $36 at another, and $35.95 at a third place, based on their own pricing guidelines. In the end they have to consider their cost (ie wholesale) since margin is extremely important for profit. The only one who loses when a product is sold for less than the regular retail is Macy\u2019s since it eats into their margin. I can\u2019t speak for Macy\u2019s, but typically something like an employee discount is already taken into consideration when calculating GMROI, and a 20% discount is not going to result in them losing money, they simply don\u2019t make as much as they would if they offered no discount. It\u2019s not insignificant, just probably not as much as you might think. \n\nSource is I buy TNF and Nike (for a retailer that is not Macy\u2019s) and often have to suppress pricing per their MAP policy. Usually it only applies for a short period of time like the first few weeks something is available to consumers, which we wouldn\u2019t want to put it on sale anyway if we can sell it regular price. \n\nIn regards to the store card requirement, I think it has more to do with ensuring the person using the discount is in fact the employee and not a friend or relative. They also don\u2019t want employees reselling product on eBay or elsewhere and making a profit. It\u2019s the best way they can track abuse. ",

There is no \"or\" here. It would be trivial for Macy's to have a standard employee discount on all unrestricted items **AND** have a work around solution which also allows you to use the discount on restricted items.\n\nThey already have a prepaid card and a credit card. They are clearly capable of applying the discount though multiple systems.",

We were given a special gift card that we could reload and when we would pay for purchases we got 5% off (10% in November &amp; December).\n\nWe also could sign up for the promotional credit card and get the discount applied there, which was a solid 10% (15% November &amp; December).\n\nI was a minor at the time, so I used the gift card.\n\nI would recommend just using the prepaid card, as 26% APR is terrible.  Of course, if you are able to pay the bill off reliably and will actually shop at Macy's, get it just to build your credit.\n\nOn a side note, one of my co-workers got fired when he found out he could reload the gift card with itself.  They gave us two identical gift cards each (one for our spouse, if we had one), so my co-worker loaded $500 onto his card, and then went from store-to-store reloading the card with itself.  He would just calculate the new total, bumping the value of the card up each time:\n\n500 - 525 - 551.25 - 578.81 - 607.75 - 638.14 - 670.05 - 703.55 - 738.72 - and so on.\n\nApparently, in one week he turned $500 into $2000+, and when the store figured it out they sacked him immediately.  He kept the ill-gotten funds, but that would only pay his grocery bills, not his rent.  It was an overall bad move.",

It's a pain in the ass, not unethical. You go to the register with your purchase, use cash or a check to put money on the Macy's card that equals the amount of your purchase, then they ring you up with the prepaid card. If you do it this way, there are no fees or interest charges. It's not like those Visa gift cards or shady prepaid debit cards that cost you money to use. You receive your discount with no other strings attached.\n\nPractically speaking, when I was there, it works this way because of how their back office handles employee discount transactions. The discount is not taken at the point of sale - nominally, you're charging the full price to your card, but when the statement arrives, your transactions and balance (if applicable) takes your discount into account. So, to buy a $20 item:\n\n* Calculate discount price ($16, assuming a non-taxable item)\n* Put $16 on prepaid card at register\n* Get rung up at $20 and pay with card\n* Receive statement at end of cycle showing a $16 pre-payment, a $16 purchase, and a $0 balance\n\nWhen I started there, I was only 17 and ineligible for a regular credit card. I received the prepaid card with no hard credit inquiry or impact on my credit score. Presumably, you can request the same. \n\nObviously, some people will fall into a trap if provided with a credit card and an incentive to use it, but this is really no different or worse than advertising the card to their customers and offering extra discounts for using it (and if you strongly object to that practice, it may be time to re-start the job hunt - it's a huge part of their marketing strategy, and you'll be expected to participate in this in your interactions with shoppers).\n",

National average consumer debt in the US is right around $16k per person causing constant issues in various areas. It is almost predatory practices if they know full well that mainly young people get hired (clueless about finances) or older people (don't read terms). Individuals who keep saying, just pay it off blah blah are ignoring the fact that the majority of people don't do that. And even the ones that do still overspend due to the psychological effect of using a plastic form of payment. (doesn't trigger pain sensors in the brain as it would using cash)",

Everyone was pissed. But it did actually work out for the better because they gave 15% back in points as opposed to 10% off.\n\nSo you HAD to sign up for SYW to receive those benefits.\n\nTo be honest I always saw employee discounts as a distraction from the crappy pay anyway, and a way to trying and make your employees give their money back to the company.\n\nThese retail places with no decent online presence are all pretty much screwed anyway, they're just trying to stay profitable anyway they can.",

We look at him, ignored his sale pitch, and pulled the receipt from his hand,  and pay off the balance 2 days after the delivery. I feel bad for people who carry balance with store cards , because the interests are astronomical. \n",

It's up to YOU to realize how much you can afford to spend on credit and still payback in a timely manner before you get hit with interest charges. As long as you stay in your budget and don't go out and buy stupid shit that will take you a year to pay back then you'll be fine, and often times will be better off than using your debit card or cash (if the credit card offers any rewards). Don't fear credit, fear your uncontrollable spending habits maybe, but not credit. ",

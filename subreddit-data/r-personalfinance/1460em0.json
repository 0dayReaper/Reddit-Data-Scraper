    "postText": "I'm looking for some advice on purchasing the mobile home my family and I have lived in for 4 years. My mom and I started renting a mobile home at the beginning of 2019, she unfortunately died at the beginning of this year. I am 25, work landscape and make between 600-700 a week, rent is 1300 a month currently and goes up every year.. I asked my sister to cosign on a mortgage with me because I figured it would save me some money, but she says she can't because she wants to buy her own house this year. My question is do I really need a cosigner for a 45k trailer? And if my sister would help me would that mess with her buying her own place? \nThank you in advance for any advice.",

Don't put family (or anybody else) in that position of having to worry about your ability to make payments.\n\nIf you don't qualify for the mortgage on your own, keep saving up until your down payment is large enough that you can qualify for the mortgage.",

You\u2019re going to have to talk to some lenders and see what they say.",

You\u2019ll either qualify for a loan on your own merits, or you won\u2019t and can\u2019t afford it.\n\nA co-signer would be out in a terrible position where they become 100% liable for the loan, but wouldn\u2019t own the asset the loan covers and they can\u2019t sell it. It would be much less of an imposition to simply ask your sister to give you the money outright as a gift, and I presume she probably couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t.\n\nShe is correct. If she co-signed, it would impact her ability to borrow money. The amount of the loan would be reported as her debt for the purpose of a bank determining whether or not to lend her money (and what interest to charge her).",

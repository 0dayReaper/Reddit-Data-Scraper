I have the money to pay for EMT school and would finish it before school starts and I have to move away. I have applied to countless \u201centry\u201d positions in my hometown and have yet to receive a job. Not even McDonald\u2019s or Taco Bell will hire me. The school costs 2600$ which is a lot but I really need a job. I\u2019ve never wanted to be an EMT or in the medical field but I need to make money while I\u2019m getting my degree.",

I say this to warn others considering the career: Being in any first responder role requires a calling. It isn't for everyone and requires a lot of sacrifice that the general public neither realizes or really appreciates. If you are just doing it for a paycheck, it's probably not worth the long term risks.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m starting to manage husband\u2019s ((28y/o) retirement accounts and am very confused. \n\nHusband has 2 jobs. Both in US. Job #1 is part-time and offers a 6% match. The target fund available for his desired retirement year (2060) is JAKYX, so 6% goes into that.\n\nHere is where my problem and confusion comes in. Job #2 is full-time and offers a 6% match as well. He\u2019s investing 12% ($336/mo) into a 2060 target fund that was made by his employer (no ticker). It\u2019s composed of: 71.14% is non-domestic stock, 24.31% US stock, 2.65% US bonds, 1.61% cash, 0.20% non-US bond. Exp gross is 0.11%. \n\nBelow are other investment options for job #2. Most don\u2019t have tickers so I\u2019m even more confused. I listed the highest and lowest gross exp. I don\u2019t know how to rebalance it. I\u2019m thinking 6% into the 2060 target fund above to get the match, then I\u2019ll open a ROTH IRA and invest $6,500/yr into FDKVX since his 401k is already with Fidelity. But I would like to max his 401k for the income tax benefits. Sigh, help. My 401k is maxed and entirely in VFFVX, and my Roth IRA is maxed and entirely in VOO if that makes any difference. \n\n\n\nMDDCX, MDILX, blackrock (BR) large cap blend index fund (exp 0.08%), (BR) mid cap blend index fund, BR small cap blend index fund, BR TIPS index fund, BR US debt index fund, mass mutual stable value fund (exp 0.34%), Vanguard long term bond index.",

Are you guys able to make Roth IRA contributions with your income? \n\nAlso, just call whoever holds the plans, they have people that will know the specifics of each plan and be able to help you understand the investments and options.",

Pick one and max it out the other if you can't max it out put at least 13% into it. Why the accounts over time defer taxes so it free money at retirement and lowers your taxable income in the front end. Whoever is your tax advisor hasn't told you your paying too much in taxes? As for the stocks diversity is your friend and market research if you don't have a stock advisor get one.",

Job #1 offers 6% match and he doesn\u2019t make enough at that job to max out his 401k so 6% is going to JAKYX.

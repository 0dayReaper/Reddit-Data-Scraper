    "postText": "Today I rolled $83,000 from a 401k into a Fidelity Rollover IRA.  My plan is to distribute this into a 3 funds (VOO, QQQM and SCHD).  Should I spend it all at once or spread it out over time?\n\nAn approach I've been considering is allocate 50% of the total right away, then 10% of the remaining balance every month.  Keep 10k liquid for buying opportunities.\n\nThoughts?",

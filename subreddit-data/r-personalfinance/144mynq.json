    "postText": "I have a roth IRA with vanguard, schwab, and fidelity. I am wondering if this is a bad idea. I already understand that the yearly contribution cap doesn't change regardless of how many roths I have. I am doing this out of a feel for wanting to diversify and fear of missing out. However, I have a feeling that as my accounts grow in number of investments, things will be harder to manage because I'm having to bounce between three different brokerages. What are some things to keep in mind? I am still pretty new to investing and would appreciate the insights of more experienced individuals out there.",

Having multiple custodians doesn't change this because the only major difference is fees involved when buying mutual funds from the others. They all have practical equivalents to each other to avoid this anyway.\n\nPick the one whose interface and other \"intangibles\" like customer service work out best for you and stick with them.",

And I want to hear about whether many of you just use one account and diversify within that one account.  \n\n\nI personally find the fidelity UI most friendly of the three so far. I may just stick with that. But they don't offer a high yield savings like schwab does, so that was the initial reason why I created my schwab account. And vanguard was the first I started with several years ago.",

I don't feel the need for another one. Just buy a broad market index fund, that's all the diversification you need. As you get older you'll want to throw some into a bond fund but that will take care of most of your diversification needs.\n\nAs far as high yield saving, you can go with a 7-day money market fund instead. Schwab's equivalent that I use is SWVXX but probably Vanguard and Fidelity have something similar.",

I have heard about waiting before investing in bonds when you\u2019re older. And that with target index funds, you are diversified as much as you can be. One problem ive heard with this is that it invests in bonds as well so its not good for those who wanna invest aggressively. I have invested in the vanguard 2065 targeted return when i was 22. I put a thousand in it and never put money in it regularly until the recent months. But i have transferred all my investments from vanguard and fidelity into schwab. So im curious as to what the target date fund I invested in will be when the transfer is finalized in my schwab account (like will it be the schwab version of the targeted date fund or still the vanguard version). Also interesting idea of the 7 day money market fund. Definitely will add to my to research list. Im currently 25 so hearing you all in comments is really enlightening :)",

But Schwab will have something similar. That said, Schwab will *not* sell your Vanguard fund and put you in the Schwab version for you, they have no legal authority to do that. You would have to do it.\n\nIf they do transfer Vanguard over you can leave it alone and just start using the Schwab fund for new investments, there's nothing harmful in that.",

Given the current high interest rates it seems like a 0% down payment option would be the way to go.  Saving our current down payment would allow us to finance the mortgage for 3 years which by then we'd hopefully have renter income as well.  \n\nAre there any pitfalls to a 0% down loan and potential refinancing if rates go down?",

Hence, *higher* exposure to the \"current high interest rates\" that you seem to imply you would like to avoid.\n\nIf your goal is avoiding high interest rate exposure, then you'd want a *higher* down payment rather than the opposite.",

Mortgages depend on the Fed, and while the Fed might stop rate hikes, I don\u2019t think they want to seesaw back into decreased, especially with inflation still higher than the 2% target even if it isn\u2019t crushing.\n\nWhat if the rates don\u2019t go down and you\u2019re stuck paying current rates?

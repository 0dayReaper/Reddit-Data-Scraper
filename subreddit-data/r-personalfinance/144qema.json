            "comment": "I too am a father of a special needs child (now 21) and just as sarfbot mentioned, there is a lot to uncover. First, I would recommend accumulating documentation from doctors that specifically state your sons' condition. Then couple that with your sons' individual education program if they are in public school. Next obtain support from your sons' school guidance consular for filling paperwork with the Social Security Administration if their status warrants it. They denied our application initially, but once the school consular got involved, it was approved with retroactive payments. You may be, as was I, capable of maintaining my son's needs, but if something was to happened that negatively affected your livelihood, you do not want to initiate your request then. If warranted, file with your state for guardianship of your sons before their 18TH birthday, as it is damned near impossible to receive guardianship of an adult without jumping through major hoops. Even before they turn 18, the state will assign a guardian ad litem that would act on your sons behalf to protect them from unnecessary loss of rights. All of this seems like a lot, but prepare yourself and do it while it is not desperately needed. Good Luck and I pray for the best outcome for you and your sons.",

It\u2019s care outside of school if you need it that costs (iirc). I\u2019ve grown up around all range of special needs in rich or poorer and if you aren\u2019t well off check your state for any assistance they offer.",

            "comment": "Is this an early diagnosis? My twin daughters had signs early and were diagnosed around the age if 2 and put on an IEP and ABA sessions. As they grew older it became clear it was quite mild and although there might be some social issues those seem also quite mild to the point im starting to just see my own awkwardness in them. At this point they are off ABA and their IEP has very little intervention in it, just sime speech therapy and social guidance.\n\nMy point being if this is an initial diagnosis at an earky age how impactful this will be to their development is probably unclear still. It is a very broad spectrum.\n\nApologies if they are older and its evident but thought id ask for clarity.",

Our oldest is on the severe end of the spectrum and our second is more on the mild end. Both are nonverbal still. Both collect SSID. My fear is they\u2019ll both end up property of the state they aren\u2019t set up financially when my wife and I pass. I was wondering if there\u2019s special accounts for disabled children? How can I protect any assets we might accrue along the journey? Anything along those lines.",

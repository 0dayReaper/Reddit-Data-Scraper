    "postText": "My grandparents (80 and 85, Georgia) get phonecalls from \"the Department of Treasury\" letting them know they have won $xxx, xxx and all they need to do is send $1000 to some person for \"taxes\" and then they will receive the money.\n\nTo my knowledge, they have sent $30k in total.\n\nThe situation at hand: my grandma got a letter saying she won $4.5 Million from \"Mega Million\" and she has to put up $150k (the lottery fund is putting up $250k \"on her behalf\") and then she will get 4.5M. She also is told she will receive a 2017 Mercedes. She is awaiting a loan for the 150k to come through.\n\nShe is keeping this as secret as possible from her two children (50s). I do not know what to do. My grandparents are okay financially, but this loan would be an extreme hardship.\n\nThings we have tried (as a family):\n- blocking phone numbers on their phones\n- calling the scammers ourselves\n- showing them Google searches that indicate the phone numbers belong to scammers\n- having friends in the police come to their house and read the letters and give their opinion\n\nClearly nothing is working. Any advice would be great, thank you.",

For example if you lost 10k at the casino, cutting your losses would mean you'd have to be able to think clearly and come to the conclusion that the 10k lost doesn't increase your chance of winning money should you continue to gamble. A lot of people don't reason things out like that. They think of their losses as investments. Sacrifices made towards big rewards.",

It might not work since you don't have legal control of their finances, but I'm pretty sure that if I contacted any of the institutions my grandmother banks with, they'd understand. \n\nWe live in a small town where everyone knows the situation, so it might not work as well for you.

Only a lawyer, one who actually works on your case, can do that, and generally conservatorship is only appropriate if there\u2019s a medical reason (including mental health and addiction) why someone is incapable of making financial decisions. The key is showing that it\u2019s not just a matter of voluntarily making poor decisions out of na\u00efvet\u00e9 or whatever.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s worth telling your grandparents\u2019 doctor(s) about your concerns so they can be screened for possible disorders, at the very least. At the early stages, disorders like dementia present with slightly impaired judgment or other very, very slight symptoms but nothing noticeable to most laypeople \u2014 and this stage of vulnerability can last a long time before it becomes obvious to the person and their loved ones. \n\nYou can also talk to your state\u2019s equivalent of Adult Protective Services. They have people trained in just this sort of intervention and they will help you determine what to do.\n\nSource: I\u2019m a lawyer who has done some pro bono guardianship/conservatorship stuff via a Legal Aid organization and recently won a case involving early stage dementia behaviors. I am not your lawyer and can\u2019t tell you what to do here, except that you shouldn\u2019t listen to people speculating about the facts of your case. \n\nAnd hey. If one of your grandparents has started to develop a neurodegenerative disorder, early medical intervention is likely to slow and maybe even stop the progress of the disorder while they\u2019re still as independent as possible. Maybe they go to the doctor and get clean bills of health \u2014 can\u2019t hurt to check, especially given their ages!",

It all hinges on whether or not a person has mental capacity to make their own decisions in a limited or broader set of circumstances. From what you have said about others explaining the situation to them, I would certainly have grave suspicions about their capacity, most likely at their age due to dementia.\n\nAs a GP, I am sometimes asked to assess the capacity of a patient by some legal setup or other, most often by a solicitor when relatives are going through a process to take control of finances. Sometimes it is quite straightforeward, and I have no difficulty in saying yay or nay about my patient's capacity. At other times it is far more complex, and I have to involve more specialist services or advise the legal people to do so. Unfortunately, capacity is an absolute minefield at times, and someone deciding to do something that most people would think is unwise or downright stupid does not of itself imply a lack of capcity - what is important is whether the person involved has the mental wherewithal to weigh up the relevant information and use it to come to a decision.\n\nWhatever the differences in the elgal process where you are, I would think it very likely that you will have to seek legal advice, and if the legal people agree, the chances are that there would then have to be some sort of assesment of mental capacity or whatever the local terminology may be. As u/NLJeroen implies, this often does not go down at all well, but may well be the kindest in the log run, just like a filling for a fearful child is ultimately kinder than waiting for a dental abscess.",

I doubt any bank would easily give someone a 150k personal loan knowing its going to a scam.\n\nAlso you might think about calling the postal inspectors.

Also I have 8 degrees and I'm a genius and worked amazing jobs all my life but please since you love me pay for all my very expensive hobbies and this guy's condo who is totally not my real boyfriend but I live with him). She has made him angry and paranoid that all we want is his money. She is in the will, but she keeps trying to change it and she is setting up appts to try and get complete control of his money and health decisions. \n\nLuckily my dad has stepped in and has gained some control, so the lawyers and bank tellers give my dad a heads up when things are fishy, but Grandpa can voluntarily revoke my dad's authority anytime. We are walking on eggshells trying to pretend to like this woman, inviting her to everything (she doesn't even show up to his birthday parties), but still gently suggesting he watch his finances when his spending gets a little crazy. Sometimes we luck out and he asks my dad to help him withdraw X and then he forgets to actually do it. We have a \"beginnings of dementia\" diagnosis but lawyer says it's still not enough to completely take over because while very forgetful, he's still mostly there. \n\nNext step is conservatorship but that means going to court and Grandpa is on a hair trigger of rage whenever he thinks we are out to steal his money. He continually says he wants to spend it all before he dies, which is fine but he'll be out of money long before that and he's never been a nice man so we are basically trying to stem the tide so none of us have to take him in. While it's so obvious what is going on, it's much harder to prove that this is financial elder abuse and not \"people do dumb things when they're in love.\"",

But they were desperate and looking for work, so this seemed like an opportunity to them. They got upset with me when I pointed out how it was almost guaranteed to be a scam. Fortunately, the bank was able to verify the check was fraudulent right away. They'd have been out a lot of money that they didn't even have.",

Your grandparents are demonstrating poor judgement and need to be examined by professionals to determine if they need a guardian assigned to manage their affairs.\n\nI would assume this will be necessary for any legal recourse.  Individuals lacking capacity cannot make legal decisions (financial, legal, medical, etc.) for themselves.  That is also grounds to block the loan you mentioned.  There also may be action that can be taken against the lenders and whoever witnessed their signature (notary, attorney, etc.) on the loan documents.  After all, they are not just attesting that the person signing the documents is really that person, but they are also saying the person signing the documents has the mental capacity to do so.\n\nI've seen this happen before.  Fortunately, the bank blew the whistle and blocked the most egregious part of the fraud.",

Tell them the issue and if they have a formal way of dealing with scams targeting the elderly.\n\nNext, submit copies of the documentation to the FBI. Even though they might not do anything right away, it will become part of ongoing investigations regarding this type of fraud.\n\nThen, check out the FBI webpages regarding fraud. [You can find their Fraud Alert page here](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes).\n\nPrint the page and review some of these frauds with them.\n\nDon't be condescending, don't be discouraging. Pretend you're trying to inform a coworker or a neighbor. Leave that paperwork behind for them to review on their own.\n\nConsult Elder Affairs and a lawyer. Temporary injunction (or whatever it's called) might be enough. Being scammed means doing things without a cool down period. Allowing the victim to step back can throw some cold water on the idea may b helpful in having them reconsider.\n\nBest of luck!\n Edit: clean up.",

I've also dealt with this in my own family (these scam artists should burn in hell).\n\nUnfortunately, there are no quick and easy solutions.  The advice always come down to one of four options:\n\n1.)The vulnerable individual divests themselves of their assets (or control of their assets) and places control into the hands of another, either via a trust (very common), power of attorney (very common), or outright gift (extremely uncommon).\n\n2.)The vulnerable individual is subjected to a conservatorship petition in which you strip them of control of their possessions via court order in a legal proceeding (uncommon, but sometimes the only way).  \n\n3.)Someone watches them 24/7 so long as they are amenable to taking advice.\n\n4.)Wait until medical conditions or age removes the problem.  :(\n\nThat's it.  Pick one.  \n\nMost people will ignore my advice, above, and instead try one of various types of chicanery in an attempt to  prevent assets from being squandered.  They ignore the fact that they aren't actually confronting the problem.  Hiding of keys, taking cars away, trying to hide account statements, stealing checkbooks, etc., are only stopgap measures and don't address the fundamental underlying issue that grandma/grandpa are no longer capable of managing their affairs.  Plus, they typically lead to frustration for all parties and are ethically and legally dubious.  \n",

He would tell me he was going to stop, but then keep secretly sending money to scammers. \nI got a lawyer who specializes in elder care. I eventually had to threaten my father with financial guardianship before he stopped. \nBut, I made him agree to give me power of attorney, I can monitor his phone records, bank accounts, email, credit cards. \nI also made him agree to change his phone number, and that if he gets his new number on a scammers list, I will change it again - this is a good incentive not to answer mailers, because he has to contact everyone he knows each time his number is changed and give them some excuse as to why it changed. But this is a very important step. If you block a scammers number, they will call from a different number. If you change your grandparents number, and make sure it\u2019s unlisted, it goes a long way. These scammers can be very persuasive with elderly people. No matter what happens, they really need to be cut off permanently from talking to these people. \nBut if they don\u2019t agree to these things, you\u2019ll want to petition for financial guardianship for sure.  Otherwise it will only get worse. ",

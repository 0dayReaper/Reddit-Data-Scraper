Secure pre approval for a loan through a bank or credit union and then go to the dealer and ask what loan they can offer without disclosing anything more than \"I'm pre-approved through my bank but I'm willing to see what your financing offer is\". You aren't forced to use the loan offer from the bank and if the dealer has a better package, great! If not, your bank loan is a better deal. You are taking the best deal vs being stuck with whatever the bank says or whatever the dealer says",

If you payoff the loan early, you still only pay interest on the loan through the month the loan was paid off.  Any unearned interest is refunded back out of the balance.  The interest on the accounting end is still earned monthly based on the Rule of 78s.  So when the loan is paid off early it's rather trivial to determine how much of the interest was unearned.",

If the loan is open 8 months of a 24 month term, the consumer only pays 8 months worth of interest *not* 24 months.  I don't see any argument where *that* could be construed as screwing the consumer.\n\nNow, the method interest is *earned* on a precomputed loan is less favorable than simple interest accrual.  So if a consumer wants to make a lump sum paydown (not payoff) of the loan, they'll get screwed on a precomputed loan because that *does not* reduce the amount of interest earned per month like it would on a simple interest accrual method.  Or if the loan is paid in full early in the term the consumer will pay more interest for that time period than would have accrued on a simple interest loan.  So that's two ways a consumer *is* getting screwed by precomputed interest.  \n\nAlso, if carried out to full term with no paydown or prepayment, then there is functionally no difference between the two as the consumer will ultimately pay the same amount of interest.",

Early payment makes no difference whatsoever.\n\nLenders are able to offer lower rates with precalculated, because they'll never have to deal with anyone saving on interest through quicker repayment.\n\nWe saw that lower rate and went with it, not knowing that this type of loan even existed. In retrospect, we probably would have gone with the slightly higher rate, but at least this was only 4.3% on an $18k loan. Wasn't crippling or anything like that.",

So for most situations if the rebate is taken off of the amount financed, you can literally pay off the loan 5 minutes later without losing the incentives.\n\nBut yes, always read the fine print on the paperwork.  Don't take the salesman's word for how long you need to keep the financing, actually read the documents they give you.",

You can get online savings accounts closer to 4% right now, again federally insured.  Also, treasury bonds give a return better than 0% and are backed by the federal government.\n\nAnd if all of that is too high of a risk, keep the money in cash at home.

Like most of the loan, &amp; in that sense, you got this smaller payment to pay off sooner that you got instead of the bigger hurtle. It\u2019s more for establishing credit history, than compared to simply paying off debt. Thus it\u2019s more inline with the system in place, which is to have a credit history, as opposed to no history &amp; all debts paid off. I personally think the format of the current system is wrong. It encourages people to pay more (interests), than you would if things were easily done with. I guess the best way to explain this is, if tipping was not only mandatory, yet how much you pa\u00edses back, &amp; for how often, how long, mattered. This is supposed to be in stark contrast to having something cheap stay cheap, instead of inflating the cost at the end to be much more than the original price. Imagine a burger than is 6 bucks, yet with break in payments it comes out to about 9 bucks spent. Sounds crazy right? All for the sake of \u201cbuilding history\u201d. Well, to me, that\u2019s how I feel about how credit is done in the usa.",

Mostly due to the hard pull.\n\nYou do need to make sure that the loan doesn't have anything hidden, like some do, so that you end up paying all the interest even if you pay it off early.  And that the sales contract doesn't have anything hidden, like taking back the rebate if you pay the loan early.  I've heard about things like that, but don't know how common they are.",

Rebates often come from the finance arm of the manufacture to capture finance. You can finance the minimum amount or the whole thing. \n2. Paying off a larger loan amount early will have more of a positive impact on your credit long term than a smaller amount will.\n3. You DO NOT HAVE TO BUY ANY PRODUCTS IN FINANCE EVER TO QUALIFY or get a cheaper rate. \n4. Yes the dealer gets paid a small commission for you financing usually $100 to a max of 1% of loan amount. Usually have to pay off after 90 days to avoid it being clawed back \n5. Some lenders require one payment to be made.\n\nIn the end take the loan. Do for a mid amount and pay off between 30-91 days.\n\nCredit building tip for future car purchases if you have new credit or first time buyer finance as much as you can. To create the highest possible payment on a 3-4 year term. The first payment pay off 90% and make small payments for 13 months and pay off. \n\nIt maximizes your payment amount so you qualify for more next time, shows you payed off early, and gets you 12 months of payments which means you have established your car buying history.",

            "comment": "Read the contract very carefully.  Make sure there's no minimum payment duration length of time/number of payments, etc befo4e you can pay it off.  Also, make sure there's no early payoff penalties.  Don't trust verbal confirmation from the loan person at the dealership, they aren't working for your benefit afterall.\n\nFinally, if anything isn't clear and understandable, just pay cash.  It isn't worth getting wrapped up in years of payments unless there is a definite benefit to you.  Gafter all.\n\nFinally, I always balk about any terms they throw in, ask to remove or reduce them, and always go for better rates.  It may be a good deal, or borderline good enough.  You are in control before you sign, so always ask for a better deal, and do you comps as the numbers change.  I always bring paper and pad, and loan calculator on my phone handy to check as things change.  Again, I have a hard max payment in mind, and also a best as I can guess that would be truly a great payment as well.  I usually find I'm somewhere in the middle in the end.  Just takes a bit of effort to squeeze them nickels out.",

Taking a loan on a depreciating asset is ill-advised in the first place, but is a necessary evil for most people. If you don't have to, you shouldn't. \n\nDealerships are filthy, two-faced, scam artists from top to bottom, not just the sales department. Everything they do is to squeeze more out of you.\n\nSource: was car salesman, had father who did body work for car dealership, has family friend who has been a car salesman for decades.",

            "comment": "As others said, I'd wait to pay. I mean, if the rate is sub-4%, then you might as well just carry it since your cash is worth more in a HYSA than paying off your car (that's what we do with our 0.99% loan). \n\n\"Hurting your credit\" is a little strong; there is an impact to your credit when you take on a loan. You will have a new hard inquiry added to your record, and your average credit age will go down (how much depends on how many and how old your accounts are). That said, the impact is negligible. Unless you intend on taking out a mortgage in the next few months or have credit right on the boundary between \"good\" and \"excellent,\" there is no discernible impact.\n\nYour credit score has no *inherent* value; a lot of people strive to have the highest score possible, but really it's all about how the score benefits you. In the fall/winter, my score was like... 835 or something. Right now it's 766 because I threw $18.5k on a 0% interest credit card.  Could I have just paid cash for all that? Sure! But instead, I got 2% cash back and 4.2% interest on the balance over the course of the 16 months I'll carry the debt. Ultimately that $18.5k will actually cost me $17k, *and* I get to keep some extra cash on hand just in case something truly wild comes up. A lower credit score is the \"price\" I pay, but with no need to use credit in the next year, that cost is irrelevant.",

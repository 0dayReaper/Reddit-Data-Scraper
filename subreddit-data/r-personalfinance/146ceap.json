    "postText": "I'm currently an IT contractor in NC and have two options under BCBS NASCO-SF. The Basic Plan is $178.64/mo and only appears to cover simple visits, no emergencies. The second plan is a High Deductible plan, $5000, $0 Out-of-pocket maximum which is $427.52/mo.\n\nI also have an option to buy a separate Accident $10k plan and or 10-20k Critical Illness plan. There is also a Hospital Cost Protection Plan as well that can be purchased separately but I don't understand it.\n\nI'm 30 and healthy, so I don't need a lot of visits. I'm mainly concerned about being covered should something horrible happen like a car accident or my appendix explodes.\n\nI'm about to go cross eyed looking at these plans, the US healthcare system sucks. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nI'm not sure if I should keep looking elsewhere for plans since even the High Deductible plan has caveats like Allowed Benefits after the deductible is met.",

If so, what amount is the cap?\n\nAnd FYI that high-deductible plan is almost certainly HSA-eligible which has all sorts of benefits, but only if you\u2019re in a financial position to utilize them. \n\nThe high deductible plan having a $0 OOP max doesn\u2019t make sense; OOP max is really the main \u201cbig\u201d number to worry about, so if it were $0 it would mean your deductible is also $0",

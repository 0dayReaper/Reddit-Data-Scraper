    "postText": "My (US) Federal Credit Union for several years has sent me letters about the \"Securian Life Insurance Policy\" I could buy or pay for as a bank member. I already have decent life insurance from my current and a previous job so I just threw these offers away. I recently got a letter from Securian directly (\"provided\" thanks to my credit union) that I now have a $1,000 single coverage policy with them at no cost to me. My questions are should I be concerned about this? Does having this life insurance mess with any of my other existing plans? Reading over the few pages they provided it is only really clear they want to cover me for more money but I do have some minimum plan with them? I feel I should opt out somehow as I feel my bank sold them my information. This feels very dirty on my bank's part.",

There is a chance the credit union owns that insurance company and never sold your information.\n\nSource: Work at a credit union, that information in disclosures is required by law, credit union I work for owns an insurance agency (not company) we require permission from members to do anything with the insurance as at that point we are sharing information with companies like progressive and geico.",

Sure, it's not a big sum to center your end-of-life plans around, but it likely wouldn't be a bad thing for the funeral costs and whatnot. Yes, it is mainly to entice you to buy more coverage, but as long as you have coverage already through your employer, you don't need to buy more at all.",

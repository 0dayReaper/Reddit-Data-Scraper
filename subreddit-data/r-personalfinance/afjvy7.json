We don't allow posts on pending legislation because (a) most proposals are never enacted into law and (b) a lot of people are unable to maintain their chill when politics is involved.\n\nWhat we're going to do is lock this post, but leave it up. Education is a good thing. The barbecue in South Carolina is pretty solid too. Cheers.",

If it takes some busy work to drill the basics of personal finance into people in HS, then this is one instance where I would agree with busy work, because this \"skill\" is so essential to leading a good life. \n\nBesides, I'm sure there's tons of material that could be presented to fill up a semester's worth of class. Debit vs credit, how to tell if a loan is a good deal, how to manage far too much debt (in case, for whatever reason, you find yourself in that situation later in life), different types of investment and their pros and cons, how to do your taxes (again, I know tons of people with college degrees that still have their parents do their taxes and don't know how to do it) etc... A lot of people here might consider this stuff not worth going over, but so many people know nothiing about personal finance",

Wants vs needs, how to price compare, how to cut down if you're struggling \n\n- and as an offshoot of budgeting-- FOOD. How to shop for groceries, how to cook cheaply and healthily, how to stretch basic recipes and cheap veggies to make it work, how nutrition works and cost of healthy vs processed\n\n- how to thrift shop and look for quality items on a serious budget. Fabric type, fit, condition for clothes, and how to make simple repairs on furniture and electronics. No need to buy everything new. \n\n- what government resources are available and how to apply for them: WIC, food stamps, CHIP, Medicare, etc etc\n\n\nHonestly there are SO MANY THINGS I never learned growing up that I've had to teach myself, but it's so incredibly daunting when you don't even know what you don't know. A class like this would be SO useful and SO SO full. A lot of it ISNT common sense, and a lot of it people just have no concept of. You'd have to start cutting material before you ended up with empty days and busy work. \n\nEdit: maybe it would be better to take the lesson plan and just make a YouTube channel lol... ",

None of the items on your list was covered or taught at our k-12 schooling and it\u2019s all things that are so very important to know in adulthood! Luckily, my parents taught me much of it as a young adult, but years into adulthood one of my close friends was struggling with finances and (eventually) I asked if she would mind disclosing all her finances with me/work benefit options...so I could suggest/teach anything I knew I hopes to help. I honestly felt so completely uncomfortable bringing it up and was nervous it\u2019d make our friendship really awkward because it seems like talking about the ins and outs of those matters are \u201cpersonal\u201d and you\u2019re \u201cnot supposed to ask or tell\u201d. To my surprise, she was relieved and said she would absolutely love and appreciate that. She said that it\u2019s something her parent never knew and therefor didn\u2019t teach, we weren\u2019t taught it in school and then after our \u201cyoung adult years were past, she felt silly asking anyone so she just kept struggling. We made it a regular weekly \u201ccoffee and books session\u201d between the two of us. Started with the opening an account to designate as \u201cEmergency account\u201d, then listing and prioritizing debts to pay off, budgeting.... pretty much your whole list. It\u2019s been years since then and she\u2019s at a way better spot now. The situation made me really grasp how important teaching that in school really is. If someone isn\u2019t taught it at home, and it\u2019s a taboo topic by societies norms...how is a person going to search out what they don\u2019t know to search out?",

At a high school I attended for just 1 year I would characterize an awful lot of what I did as pointless \"busy work\". My Spanish class was probably the worst offender under that category as we mostly just did crossword puzzles and word searches while the teacher watched YouTube and looked at his halo 3 stats online. My English class there was basically story time where the elderly teacher read a few novels to the class over the course of the year and there were only 2 or 3 meaningful assignments all year, my \"honors\" chemistry class was a disaster. Math was probably the only class that was halfway decent at that school. And this was the large public high school nearby. I had almost no homework and loved the amount of free time I had for Halo but didn't learn much. I then transferred to a charter school that was much more focused and the difference was night and day.

No one that age is going to care because it has no relevance to them at the time its taught. By the time it does become useful the information is likely long forgotten and possibly outdated. I certainly had no benefit nor use to learning about the stock market and mortgages when I was 14. 7 years later I can finally begin exploring the market, but even mortgages are years if not a decade away. \n\nWhat they should be emphasizing is the life-long effects of the debt burden our society will be bestowing upon graduating high school students when they enter college. A path that our government is fixated on continuing.",

I think the emphasis of a class is for exposure to personal understanding so students have a head start to having some control over their own lives. \n\nI would hope at the middle school and high school level students would learn the time value of money and how interest may work for and against you. These concepts may be later applied to investing and financing.  Students may later have a better understanding of computing their return on investment or the interest charged against them in college loans, credit cards and later on mortgage payments. \n\nQuite often children learn their financial strategies from their parents and without assistance some may continue the inefficient methods that were passed down. I would hope if some students understood these concepts from the above class they may start saving earlier and be aware of how debt can hinder ones entire life. May not work for everyone but hopefully some. Maybe one day they will be handling our society\u2019s debt burden",

Both worked their first jobs in 2018. Neither knew they needed to file taxes. Neither knew how to track spending from a checking account (which I get since they may not write checks) or a debit card (which they don\u2019t have yet but should have learned about) and neither seemed comfortable with the concepts of credit cards, like don\u2019t spend what you don\u2019t have in your bank account. I would bet it was probably a blow off class that had videos half the time and was taught by someone who had no financial background (are you going to pull a math teacher from other classes for this one?) and probably was taught by a coach who they spent funding on and figured they could probably teach kids sports so why not finance?

Taking a personal finance class.\n2. Having savvy parents sit them down and let them examine the family's budget, resources, goals, etc.\n3. Getting a job or having regular chores and being given the freedom and responsibility to decide how to spend and save the money they earn.

He was telling me that after work he's going to pick up his new $50,000 truck, and that he's really excited. He had apparently got the money from his grandfather or something passing.\n\nI tried my best to explain to him how a $50,000 could be worth about a million dollars when he retires if he invests it. I even walked him through how it will essential double every 10 years (50,000 @20 ; 100,000 @30; 200,000 @40; 400,000 @50; and 800,000 @60).\n\nHe didn't want to hear any of it.

How is this going to fit in with existing schedules (I.e. what other quarter-long class will it be paired with)? \n\n2) Is the \u201cend of year\u201d exam going to be an official EOC written by the state? If so, who\u2019s paying for that and with what money? \n\n3) Who is going to teach this class? What training will they receive? How will they be assessed? \n\n4) Who writes the standards and curriculum for the course? \n\n5) When would it be implemented and how would it\u2019s implementation affect students who don\u2019t have space in their schedule for it during a graduation year?",

We covered how to fill out W-4s, 1040EZ, and how to write a check. They also spent like two weeks scaring us away from using credit cards (bad take) and payday loans (good take!), ever. That's really about it. On top of that, none of the students in the class ever paid attention or cared, per usual.",

In the past I've argued pretty strongly that everything you need to know about personal finance, you learn through regular classes by about 5th grade. And I still think that's true. Sure, they don't teach you every last detail of the tax code, but you have the reading compression, research, and math skills needed to figure everything out.\n\n\nBut it's becoming obvious that lots of people never put two and two together to understand this stuff. I've found that even people I consider rather intelligent have a gross misunderstanding of things like the tax system, budgeting, loans/credit cards, and investing. There would probably be a decent set of people that would benefit from a well-designed personal finance course.\n\nOne thing that would be neat would be to randomly assign students certain levels of income. Then basically make it a life simulator, with income, taxes, bills, savings, investment, etc. And have some percentage of their grade tied to how well they manage these responsibilities. (Probably assign points to achieving certain outcomes in each category, rather than tying it to net worth, to avoid making it a race to win big on some penny stock or something.)",

I took it for kicks my senior year, and it was me and all the kids who weren't likely to go to college and didn't have parents that would be gifting them a house or or car, and wouldn't be covering their bills if they fucked up. Most of them wouldn't be staying at home past high school.\n\nAt the beginning we were given a meaningless job title and given a starting amount of about $1000 and an imaginary weekly salary based on minimum wage at the time. There was an option for benefits for less money for none for more money. Then we were given real ads for rentals, the most modern Sears catalogs they had, and told to find a place to rent and furnish. We could partner up if we wanted and have a couple or roommates. We pretty much all had to.\n\nEvery day we had to draw cards the teacher made. Maybe you got a flat tire this week and had to fix it, or if you couldn't afford it you lost wages. Maybe someone passed away and left you some money you could spend or save.  Maybe you broke an arm and how much you owed was based on whether you took the insurance or not, plus losing wages for being unable to work. It was engaging and relatable for most of the students in it, and a chance to learn from everyone's decisions along the way.\n\nIt set me and most if the people who took the class up to be better decisions starting out, and the ones I've kept in touch with have better lives than a lot that didn't take it.\n\nIt was the single most useful class I took in high school (I was in advanced math already, and was eligible for AP everything whether I took it or not) and the only one where I still use what I learned every day.\n\n10/10 would require, especially for those that won't get the education elsewhere.",

He was given the opportunity to create electives. One was called \u201cprinciples of success in life\u201d. He taught them about personal finance, how to budget, how to look for jobs and prepare for interviews, setting goals to achieve success, etc. He knew if he used an elective, which would require him to make up his own curriculum, he had more flexibility to tailor the class to be fun and interesting for a wider group of students. It turned out to be his most in demand class and filled up quickly every year. He first created this class probably 15-20 years ago. I still hear from former students about this class and how helpful it was. I didn\u2019t take his class, but I try to apply the same principles he taught me at home. ",

In Canada we have something called an \"RESP,\" which is basically a 20% match by the government for any money put into a university fund before the student turns 18.

However it must be opened before they're 16, I believe.  You can also retroactively contribute a bit.  \n\nMany students get part time jobs in high school to save for university. \n\nIf you tell them this when they are 13/14, anyone  who has a part time job can open the account and get a free $2000 when they're 18 just by contributing (around half of) their summer job earnings to this fund.\n\nNobody seems to know you can do this, but by 13 most students have some idea as to whether they want to go to university or not. Even if they don't, all they lose is the 20% match so this is still a good option for them. \n\nI had a class like this way back when I was in high school, it was in grade 10 and a complete waste of time.

Who teaches it and what their qualifications are is another issue to consider. \n\nAlso, times change and laws are often slow to keep up. Imagine this happened 30 years ago when learning to balance a checkbook was much more central to personal finance than it is today, but you can't reduce it's focus in the curriculum because it's mandated by law. Granted the concept is still important, but the evolving nature of finance needs to be addressed. \n\nBL: It's a vital topic that should absolutely be taught, I'm just skeptical that gov't mandates are the best route to implementation.

So I can\u2019t imagine how a course taught in 9-18 weeks could train us on all the different tax implications especially when they change yearly. \n\nMy other issue is there isn\u2019t a one type fits all answer for creating a budget or paying down loans. It all varies on your current situation (location, income level, etc) and it can dramatically change depending on age and goals. I consider myself relatively smart and I still leave the bulk of my financial planning to a financial advisor. \n\n\nSo these days I don\u2019t think these classes are a priority. I\u2019d rather spend the time teaching kids critical thinking and logical reasoning that can be applied to everyday life. Maybe it will prevent all these kids from falling for MLM schemes and such",

Mostly this was so they wouldn't always be asking me for money (because we'd previously been doing well) and I didn't tell them the whole extent of how bad we had it. Oddly enough, this small once a week thing made them really think about the value of money and the difference between needs and wants. As adults, they are phenomenal savers; one is doing well with investing money in the stock market, while the other one is investing in rental properties. Neither makes a huge amount of money, though they did think things through about how to make the most pay from their interests. All totally accidental on my part.\n\nAnything the state can do to help kids learn to take control of their adult lives is a plus.",

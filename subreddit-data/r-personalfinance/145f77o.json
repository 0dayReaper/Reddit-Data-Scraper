I have about $26k in a 401k from my previous company and about $500 in a personal Roth IRA. Should I roll my 401k into my 403b? Move the 401k into the Roth? Not sure how this works or what would be the best move.",

            "comment": "There is no one size fits all answer. Compare the funds in the 401k and 403b. Does the 403b have all of the comparable funds that you want to invest in? If it's Vanguard, there is a good chance it will have decent Vanguard mutual funds with low expense ratios, such as VFIAX or VIIIX for s&amp;p 500. Does your old 401k have management fees or higher expense ratios on the fund options? If so, probably best to roll out. Do you want to have more investment options than what is available in either the 401k or 403b? Then roll into a rollover IRA, as long as you don't plan on wanting to do a backdoor Roth IRA conversion.",

Most people on there will advocate you pick some combination of a  s&amp;p 500 fund, and /or an all stock fund, an international fund, and a bonds fund. 1-4 low cost, diversified funds that you set and forget.",

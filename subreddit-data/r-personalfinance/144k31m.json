    "postText": "`Hey, fellow Redditors! I'm seeking some feedback and opinions on my Roth IRA portfolio allocation strategy as I plan for retirement. I'm 53 years old and aiming to retire at age 65. After considering my risk tolerance and investment goals, I have initially allocated 90% of my portfolio to the S&amp;P 500 and 10% to short-term bonds. (starting a Roth IRA, im late, I know) However, I'd like to get your insights and thoughts on this approach.`\r  \n\r  \n`I chose the S&amp;P 500 for its historical returns and potential for long-term growth. As retirement gets closer, I understand the importance of preserving capital and reducing volatility, which is why I allocated a portion to short-term bonds. But I'm open to considering alternative strategies or adjusting my allocation.`\r  \n\r  \n`I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have. Are there any drawbacks or risks I might have overlooked? Do you recommend any other asset classes or allocations that I should consider? Have you had similar experiences or insights you can share?`\r  \n\r  \n`I value the collective wisdom of this community and look forward to hearing your opinions. Thanks in advance for your input!`",

This doesn\u2019t matter for a 23 year-old because they have forty years of paychecks in their future to smooth things out, but since you are closer to your desired retirement, you\u2019ll maximize your chance of success - that is, having enough saved - by having at least 25% of your portfolio in bonds. As a benchmark, Vanguard\u2019s Target Retirement 2035 fund is 28.6% bonds today. Holding a lot of stocks in the years immediately before and after your retirement increases your Sequence of Returns Risk (I\u2019d look this up if you haven\u2019t).\n\nI agree with the other commenter that holding international stocks is worthwhile and that the total stock market is more diversified than just the S&amp;P 500, but this decision in the icing on the cake. Your proportion of stocks and bonds is the cake.\n\nSince you\u2019re investing in a Roth IRA, I\u2019d think about just using a good 2035 target date index fund from Vanguard or Fidelity. If you want to bump up the risk a bit, use the 2040 fund instead. This handles derisking near retirement for you, with relatively low fees, and if you change your mind later you can switch funds in your IRA with no tax consequences.",

I personally have shopped around and cannot find anything even near this \"affordable\" for the current coverage we have. Bundling (just like with phone and internet) typically saves a tremendous amount.\n\nYMMV",

My first searched found no advantage for bundling- home insurance is pretty cheap, as it is a pretty simple product. Car insurance can be really pricey. \n\nI think this is a function of their being more and more different types of car issues and for homes it's basically fire insurance or something. Anyhow- I'd shop around for car insuance, the savings might more than make up for any loss in bundling. Good luck!",

For example, my rates are:\n\n* Home Insurance -- $1486\n* Car Insurance -- $620.\n\nThe total is \\~$2000.   If I bundled my home insurance with car insurance provider, this would increase to close to $4000.   If I bundled my car insurance with my home insurance provider, the total would increase to over $3000.  I save over $1000 by keeping them separate.",

Home insurance was around $1,800 a year and car insurance was running about $1,300 a year for 2 cars, 2 drivers.\n\nProgressive was offering better coverage for home insurance for about $1,820 a year and their car insurance for identical coverage was only about $600 a year for 2 cars, 2 drivers. So we switched and are saving around $700 a year on insurance.",

Live in FL, outrageous insurance prices here.....age 60, and so is hubby, we pay $2200/annual for homeowners (up $1200 in the last two years, same insurance)....and we do have 300/300/100 for car insurance, but two vehicles, $2600/annual (2009 F-150 and 2013 Explorer)...I always wonder about going elsewhere, but sometimes they say, you go to another Homeowners, and then in a year or two they just jack up the price too.....I can't go down really on the car insurance because it's FL and a lot of bad drivers down here.  Also, a lot of lawyers too and people are sue happy, which is so sad.\n\nOP, I hope you find some help in determining to unbundle or not....I am with one major company.",

I know there are a lot of factors that go into insurance rates, but the fact that our two cars (running well and presentable) are worth about $7,800 combined is probably the big difference.\n\nIn other words, it looks like you're trying to save a few hundred while driving cars that are costing you many thousands above average.\n\n(Our home insurance is actually slightly higher than yours, so I doubt it's just a matter of different zip codes.)",

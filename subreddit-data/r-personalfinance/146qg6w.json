As part of the Credit Card Act of 2009, banking institutions are required to verify \"ability to pay\" before extending credit. For most (basically all) banking products you will be required to enter that income information initially, and we utilize anything you submit voluntarily to assist in that process when evaluating increasing credit. For the banking institution that I work for, in order to provide a credit limit increase systematically or through manual review, we must have income provided by the card holder within the last 12 months. You are not required to provide that information after the initial application for the product but if you would like to be considered for a credit line increase, you do need to provide that updated income whatever it is. \n\nNow as far as validating that ability to pay, for the most part, we often take your word for it if it is reasonable based on your credit bureau and credit profile. Do you have a recent mortgage or auto loan that seems to make sense based on your reported income? If it does not make sense then we may require you to verify your income before we can consider you for a credit limit increase or to even provide you Initial credit for a credit product. \n\nIf you already have the credit product and you are not interested in getting a credit limit increase on that (or other credit products held by the same bank or its affiliates), you can decline to update it and/or ask to have your privacy settings set up where you do not receive those offers any more.",

I've called my bank (which I have a credit card with) and simply asked them if they would increase my credit just so I could improve my credit utilization, which they did over the phone. A while later, I called again to have it increased on a different credit card that I have through them and they said they'd need to do a hard credit check. Why the difference?",

I cannot think of any reason to need a hard inquiry for a credit limit increase on a credit card.  If it is for a different credit product like a \"line of credit\" or something then maybe. Depending on the bank and the card profile there are often different levels of care given to the credit bureau review. Some companies will do everything through an automated review process, some will do mostly manual review, but most probably do something in the middle where partnership cards and/or high value cards get underwritten by a human and the normal cards go through an automated review process. Neither of those processes, at least at the bank I work for, require a hard inquiry",

Credit is the biggest factor but even with an 850 credit score most banks will give you a much higher limit on 100k salary than 15k salary.  This isn't just at the sales stage, they may raise or lower your credit limit at any time based on a variety of factors and available debt to annual income is one of the major factors.",

They don\u2019t seem to use the info alone to make any sort of substantial offers that don\u2019t require further corroboration. Do you want your bank to know exactly how much you\u2019re making? I don\u2019t want to have to provide that unless I\u2019m getting a tangible benefit. I\u2019ll be honest when you ask once as part of know your customer regulations but otherwise leave me alone. But otherwise it seems like people are worried they\u2019re going to be left out if they don\u2019t put exactly how much they make.

I had just paid the card completely off and found that odd, but I assumed it was the pump and used my debit card and kept going. About 500 miles from home, I tried it again at a motel and had to use something else because the card was declined at the front desk. I got to my room and called Citibank and learned they shut the account off after I paid the balance in full. It was a cobranded Best Buy card and I bought a computer, made all payments on time and then paid in full. Apparently Citibank had a bee in its bonnet about an old bankruptcy in which one of their unsecured Visa cards was discharged in a Chapter 7 proceeding. I was blindsided because this card had a $2000 credit line and I couldn't continue traveling with the little money I had left on my debit card.\n\nI'll never forget how panicked I was. I checked out of the motel, drove back home to Louisiana using a Valero gas card, took out a local payday loan at home, drove to New Orleans, got the cheapest flights to Orlando on Sprint and Frontier, landed in the middle of the night and made it to the funeral with only a couple of hours to spare. I didn't get any thanks, just a bunch of complaints from the people who had to go to the airport to pick me up and bring me back after I delivered the eulogy. \n\nI swore after that I would never deal with Citibank again, but I didn't know they issue Shell cards and got stuck with them again. They keep raising my credit limit but I only use the card for necessities and I know now never to pay the balance completely off because they will probably pull the rug out from underneath me a second time.",

The only reason they care what your income is is to properly qualify loan/credit amounts (and legal/laundering requirements), so making payments on time (even minimum payments that simply rack up interest) means they have no incentive to investigate if you can afford the loan.\n\nThat being said, im assuming that if you default on the loan or card, claims by you that you were misled or had no way to afford start with them reviewing you saying you make $1000,000 per year, and any consumer protections can be rescinded because you submitted false information.\n\nI would also hazard a guess (though i dont know for certain, it seems logical) that theres a certain \u201cbelievable\u201d threshold. If I genuinly make $120k household income but I tell a credit company that it is $300k, they likely role with it and issue a card for that income level. If I say I make $1.5m per year, i am probably going to be requested to provide some documentation (for exclusive platinum access). People genuinely interested in fraud dont have a scale for what a truley wealthy person makes, so they will either put a ridiculous number down or put a number down that will be inconsequential to the bank (a $10,000 credit line versus a $5,000 credit line wont matter in the grand scheme of things to the bank)",

I am 150+ basis points BELOW on a credit card, than you can get a secured mortgage for.  And enough credit line to buy a brand new car (if I wanted)!",

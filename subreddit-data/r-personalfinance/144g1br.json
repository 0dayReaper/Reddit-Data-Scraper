    "postText": "About two months ago I decided to trade in my 2017 Honda Civic with 50K miles for a new 2023 Kia Forte GT. I rationalized it as taking advantage of the Honda\u2019s increased trade in value (the trade in value was higher then what I paid for the car 3 years prior with 20K miles on it) and that I could afford it because I had just gotten a promotion at work. Well, almost immediately after purchasing the car I started education myself about personal finance (reading books, Reddit posts, etc). I have since created a budget and a debt payoff plan, quickly realizing how unsound of a financial decision this was (especially considering that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my Honda).\n\n\n**Background Info:**\n\n\n- 32 years old making $80K / year\n- $25K in federal student loan debt \n- Owed $9,600 on my 2017 Honda Civic\n- Traded in my 2017 Honda Civic with 50K miles for $15,500\n- Bought a new 2023 Kia Forte GT for $27K (not including tax\u2019s and fees)\n- Financed $25K over 7 years @ 9% APR with a $408 / month payment\n\n\nCurrent plan is to pay off the car ASAP (should take me about a year and a half to pay off). I\u2019m also regretting buying into a much less reliable brand then Honda.\n\nDo I have any other options besides paying it off as fast as possible? Is it worth exploring trading the car in and getting into another used Honda?",

Sorry that you are going through this, hopefully it will be a good learning experience that kicks you into gear going forward.  When my 2006 Toyota Corolla dies I will be having Toyota and Honda fight it out for my business again.",

My concerns about Kia\u2019s reliability were eased somewhat by the warranty length, and recent positive reports about newer Kia\u2019s.",

            "comment": "Every time you buy a car, sell a car, or both, there are transaction costs. Some of those costs are money, some are your time and effort.\n\nImagine that your old Civic (or another one just like it) is probably available on a dealer's lot for $17,000. Ignoring the Kia you purchased, you sold your Civic for $15,500 and could buy it back again for $17,000. That $1,500 difference is the cost of changing from one car to another. (Plus there's some uncertainty about whether the second Civic's condition is as good as the one you sold.)\n\nWhat about the Kia? Maybe the dealer would give you $24K for it as a trade-in. So you bought for $27K, sell for $24K, and that $3,000 difference is another transaction cost.\n\nFrequently swapping cars can get expensive this way. Add things like sales tax, plus all your time and effort, and you'll quickly see why the most frugal car ownership is to buy/hold/maintain a car for a long time.\n\nIs it worth going back to a less expensive, older Civic? Maybe. Let's just think about ownership cost over time, and assume both cars depreciate at the same rate: 50% over four years. So four years of owning a $17,000 Civic will cost you $8,500, and four years of owning your $27,000 Kia will cost you $13,500. So in depreciation, maybe you'll save about $5,000/4 years. (Or maybe you'd save more, because Kias typically depreciate faster than Hondas.)\n\nIs that worth it? That's up to you. But there also may be cost differences for maintenance (Kia has warranty; Honda has better reputation), insurance (Kias are very costly to insure in some places), fuel (probably minimal difference), etc. And you can also consider which car you enjoy more.\n\nThis is basically how I would make the decision if I were in your shoes.",

Also, 9% is pretty steep, and 7 years is a very long term. Do you have good credit so you can refinance? Getting rid of the Kia and buying yet another car is just going to lose you more money, especially because you are likely upside down on the Kia.",

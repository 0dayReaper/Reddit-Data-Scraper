    "postText": "Hi guys, I just have a real quick question about this and was wondering if anyone could shed some light. My details:\n\n38, married with 1 kid and live in Ohio\nOur home is paid off, our vehicles are paid off,\nI make 41k a year(new job, just accepted), my wife makes 15k a year part time,\nWe had a nice nest egg of 10k, some imperative home repairs ate that up and we had to use some of our credit roughly 2k on cards. No other debt\n\nI worked a decent paying job for 16 years, being the primary bread winner I decided to focus my income on paying off our home and vehicles wich I did. The contract on that job ran out and I ended up in a job that pays significantly less, and just recently accepted a government position at the stated income above.  The job I had was one of those rare high paying jobs that doesn't come around very often, and with my current technical degree and skill set, any other job that I qualify for pays less. I'm fine with this. I'm at a point now where I'm ok with less stress and responsibility. \n\nThe position i just accepted details are\nSalary 40,750 per year\nIt's a state job, great benefits + retirement\nI pay the majority of the bills, added up I'm at 1600 per month. \n\nSo the original question, would it be worth doing an early withdrawal of say 3k from my old 401k, paying off this newly accrued credit card debt so I can start with a clean slate as to start building my emergency fund back up?\n\nThe 401k has 55k in currently. I plan to roll this into the government pension plan I just became a member of. At the same time, I would like to start this job in a complete saving situation and would not like to have to worry about chipping away at credit card debt.  I understand there are penalties involved, I just wanted to get some feedback on whether or this group thought it would be a reasonable option?\n\nThanks",

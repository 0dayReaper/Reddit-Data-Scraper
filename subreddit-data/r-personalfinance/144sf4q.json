            "comment": "To avoid any gift tax implications under the current IRS regulations and avoid having gifts count against your lifetime gift exemption, you are currently limited to $17,000 per person per year or for 529 you can make an $85,000 contribution every 5 years. This amount may increase in the future as the IRS periodically increases the gift limit based on inflation or tax law changes passed by Congress.\n\nGift tax is imposed on the giver and not the recipient. In the case of inheritance, there may be estate taxes that are paid on disbursements depending on the size of the estate these taxes will vary. Tax laws also vary by state with some states assessing an estate tax while others do not.",

You provided a current breakdown of your assets but then started talking about a list of wants along with no idea of costs followed by a possible career change a few years later that you say will likely lead to at least an initial decrease in income again with no details followed by moving out of state to take advantage of lower taxes all in the span of 10 years. Maybe break all of those down into separate questions and post in the relevant subreddits.",

The census data is an incredible source of info for market research. If you have no family obligations, you do have a lot of freedom to branch out and try different things. Just make sure you have a fallback position in case things don't work out.\n\nAs for me, PT is my 4th career - and probably the one I will retire from, next year. One thing I've learned: life is more fun when we reinvent ourselves periodically. I shudder when I have lunch with some of my friends who have been in the same field for 40 years. No way could I have done it.",

I know this is a broad area, so I will need to find a niche, and that will take time.\n\nI've been working since I was 17, and have been a PT for 16 years now. I agree with the benefits of reinventing oneself. Now to actually start taking the leap :)",

    "postText": "For the past month I've been renting a vehicle because I am unsure if there will be more layoffs at my company. I am in the US with a visa which means if I do lose my job I am required to leave the country within 60 days.\n\nObviously, renting is not sustainable and I need a car. Is there a preference between leasing, financing or owning outright a vehicle (cash) in the event that I am laid off? Which one will cost me the least to get rid of if I have to leave the US?",

That's what I am trying to illustrate with the chart.\n\nIf I buy a used card now for 1.5x what it's worth and the market cools (which I think it will in the short term) then I would be at a loss, regardless of depreciation.",

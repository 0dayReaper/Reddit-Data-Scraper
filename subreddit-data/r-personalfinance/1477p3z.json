Job #1, my career job l make $80k will be $85k in December, this is the job I will keep, job#2 server at a restaurant about $60k/year, this job I\u2019m looking to quit. Currently I have paid off all of my debt except the house I bought in 2020, which with tax/insurance I\u2019m at $3000/month. I have $100k liquid, half in a HYSA and half in cash, I am renting a room to a friend for $900/month. Job #1 gets me 4k/month after tax. I do expect I will have to get a new(used) car this next year as I\u2019m at 175k miles and have to 2 destination wedding next year I will be attending and need to spend a decent amount of money on. I am terrified of touching my savings and paranoid that my roommate will leave, even tho they\u2019ve been here for 2 years. Should I wait 6 more months and pack on more cash or can I quit now?",

Yeah, the roommate helps, but I'm assuming the roommate disappears after the wedding. No idea how much the fiance makes.\n\nYeah, he's fine as long as nothing changes.",

I have plans completed to add an adu unit to my home, which would give me $2000/month in additional rent. But it would wipe out my savings and would need another 20-30/k. So I\u2019m leaning towards just grinding until the beginning of the year then getting that done. It would add $2k in rent but add $500/month in expenses.",

            "comment": "seems like a good pair to choose to me.  I'd stay away from VBTIX.  I'm assuming all the others have much higher expense ratios / fees?\n\nThe Vanguard target fund is another good option.  It would have some bonds in it, but not much at your age.  That's the fire-and-forget choice.\n\nI think I'd put all in the target fund for 6 months and then re-evaluate.  By then you should know some colleagues and be able to chat with the ones who seem reasonable.  There's no tax implications to selling and buying something (or some-things) else inside your 401k.",

If you wanted a totally hands off approach, this is a good way to go.\n\nOne more thing: Roth 401k isn't always the best, usually pre-tax 401k is the way to go:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/10qwnrx/why_you_should_almost_never_contribute_to_a_roth/",

If capitalism wins, then this is good.  \n\nVTMNX is just a focus on big companies of the world.  If the VITSX does well, then this does well, because the VTMNX stocks are probably in the VITSX also.  The prospectus should tell you.",

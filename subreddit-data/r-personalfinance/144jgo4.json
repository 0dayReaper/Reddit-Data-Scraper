    "postText": "I\u2019m moving into a new apartment at the start of next month and am getting ready to sign my new lease.  The issue is first months rent and a move in fee is due at lease signing (next week).  The apartment is well within my budget, but due to some unforeseen expenses over the last few months, I don\u2019t have the savings to put up all of that before the lease starts and afford my last month\u2019s rent at my current place.\n\nHere is my plan, I can afford my last months rent for my current place and the move in fee with the savings I have and have a credit card that never carries a balance.  I\u2019m thinking of doing what I can with my savings, pay the credit card fees and take a cash advance out on my Credit Card and pay it off on the first of the month when I get my paycheck that I will normally use for rent.  Aside from having to pay cash advance fees, are there any downsides to taking this approach?  If so does anyone else have any ideas?",

My savings are enough to cover my last month\u2019s rent at my current place and the move in fee for the new place but not enough to pay 1st month\u2019s rent before the first of the month.  Normally, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but I had some car issues that drained my savings unexpectedly.",

You can then pay it off right away. Just look out for fees associated with starting the loan or paying it off early.",

If your move in date to when you'd need to use the cash advance is close enough to your pay date you maybe be able to rescind (give the money back) on the cash advance. Rescind rules differ depending on the state and company, but would also be worth looking into.",

No one really likes to ask help from family, but since you just don't have the money right now, it may be better to do that first.\n\nEdit: I just reread the last paragraph of your post. Maybe use the credit card if you can't push back your move-in date. You may be charged interest, but if it's your only option right now, just do it and pay it back fast.",

    "postText": "I have a few thousand dollars deposited into Porte Bank\u2014 this is a banking app that I heard about and opened due to the high interest rates- I have had money going in using direct deposit for the last year.\n\nThey give you a debit card but there does not seem to be a way to link the bank account to another bank\u2014 this is not really useful for me and I do not like my money just sitting in there. They\u2019ve also changed their interest rate so it is not better than any other bank I could put the money in. I\u2019d prefer my money be in a more reputable bank.\n\nThank you for your help!",

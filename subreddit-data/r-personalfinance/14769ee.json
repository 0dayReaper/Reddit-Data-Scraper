    "postText": "Husband (27M) and I (25F), are closing on our \u201cdream home\u201d at the end of the month. A fixer upper farmhouse on some acres that we can grow into. We are super excited about it but are both having a hard time adjusting to the fact our mortgage will almost triple.\n\nFor context, we bought or current home for $75k in 2018. Current mortgage payment is about $575/mo. New house is being bought for $265k, and mortgage will be about $1650/mo. \n\nWhen I run the numbers, it makes sense, it\u2019s just a huge change. When we bought our house in 2018 it was off of my husbands income of $40k per year, and we also had about $650/mo in car payments. Now, we are making about $110k per year (should be about $135k by the end of the year)and have no debt besides a small student loan we will pay off after we close ($140/mo). \n\nI think the issue is that neither of us grew up with any money and we\u2019re both very frugal, so this seems like a huge \u201csplurge\u201d to us. We both feel like we are going to be \u201chouse poor\u201d even though we will be putting about $1800 per month into savings after bills and investments. Does anyone have tips on getting rid of some of this anxiety or guilt around money?",

You have more than enough income to support it and it sounds like you aren't overzealous spenders either.  Just make sure to put money away for maintenance as larger house and acreage means bigger problems which cost more money.",

Then figure out how much you can put into retirement accounts and a taxable account, say at Vanguard, E-trade, Fidelity and Merrill Edge. (I named 4 online firms that most consumers seem to use today.  Don\u2019t know much about what Robinhood offers but that firm also does crypto trading.) \nI will assume you haven\u2019t set up 401ks, so since you qualify, open Roth IRAs for you and your husband. \nNow that\u2019s money you shouldn\u2019t touch for 30+ years, funds grow tax free and you can withdraw that without paying any taxes when you retire. \n\nStart using diversified broad based ETFs, like (stock symbols):  VOO, VUG, VIG, IWV and VCUS.  Make it 65/35% US to international exposure. You\u2019ll understand when you look up the symbols. (Naming vanguard products as they have very low expense ratios, all things being equal).  Dollar cost average, be it monthly or bimonthly, quarterly, whatever you guys decide, just don\u2019t dump all your money in at 1 time.   (Also, money market funds are paying 5%+, so you will earn money while waiting).  As you continue to be successful, at some point in the future, you will need to speak with a financial advisor, so interview at least 3.  \nI can also suggest some good basic mutual funds which gets us into active management. Personally speaking, I try and keep the ratio of active and passive investing at 50-50, but given your ages, the passive style investing works for you guys since you\u2019re just starting out. \nIf you Google \u201chow to start investing\u201d you will get a ton of info so just start reading up.  Also get Kiplingers as it\u2019s got great educational content for retail investors.  Happy to answer any questions. Best of luck.",

Numbers are great, and it\u2019s even better when you can see how everything works out like you expected for a handful of months. \n\nA bit of concern is healthy, though. Make sure you got some savings in case a project pops up. But don\u2019t loose sleep, you are living well within your means and seem quite grateful for what you have! Those two things are pretty much the hardest part for everyone else! Things will work out for ya",

Had a modest home, made about $150K combined, lived far below our means with a couple kids, and bought a bigger home in 2015 for $290K (payment was roughly $1650, better rates than today). We went through the same anxieties you are and almost tried to weasel out of the purchase. It was double what we were spending on housing prior.\n\nAnyway - best decision of our lives. Our income continued to grow but our mortgage is fixed. We still aggressively save and budget as it sounds like you will as well. Your anxiety will end up serving you well - you'll get the home you want and still meet your financial goals!",

Personally I sleep much better at night knowing that I would never lose my house as it was bought on my income, which is around 1/3 of the other person\u2019s. Between the two of us, we have enough in the bank to pay around 3.5 years worth of mortgage payments. \n\nThis is without working, or emergency funds. \n\nThat being said, based on your income. The mortgage is not unreasonable. If it makes you feel better, maybe have a slightly larger emergency fund?",

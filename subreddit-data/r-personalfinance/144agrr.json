    "postText": "Hello everyone, I have been trying to find some banks I can use instead of cashapp recently, that way I can start a proper savings accounts. The best offer I came across was chase college checking. It looks fairly promising but I also generally don't entirely understand or grasp the long information banks offer. \n\nI was wondering if any of you have used their college checking before and what were your thoughts. Pros vs cons works to.",

I\u2019m personally a total checking user but know that a bunch of international student friends in college used chase college to get started. \n\nAn online savings bank like Marcus or Ally might be great for you. Higher rates and decent mobile apps. If you need in person services (lots of cash deposits etc) then I\u2019d look for a local credit union.",

            "comment": "Chase college checking was the route I took for my first real checking account. Like others have said, there are probably better options for savings rates. However for no fees, free checks, solid app, plenty of ATMs, it worked really well for me. I've since moved into their total checking account but the \"higher level\" ones require minimum account balances in order to waive fees. I've also had checking accounts with USAA and my local credit union. The chase one has been my favorite for ease of use and setting up transfers.",

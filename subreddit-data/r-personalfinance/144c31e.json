    "postText": "If you make under 40k a year, the sad truth is that the only financial advice you need is to get a better job. The jobs exist, they are not impossible to find, you just have to put a lot of time and effort into finding them.\n\nCutting back on expenses, working a second job, balancing credit card payment, retirement payments&gt; all bullshit you that will not meaningfully impact your life compared to making more money.\n\nLet's run a budget real quick. I'm going so cheap here, so bare with me, say you make 15$/hr  or about 30k a year monthly take home pay is about 2k a month after tax\n\n- rent 500$\n- utilities 100$\n- car payment and insurance 300$\n- gas 100$\n- food 300$\n- phone + internet 100$\n- various groceries 100$\n\nA nice $1500 on mandatory expenditure that I heavily underestimated, at best you can put aside 700$ a month, putting in all your effort, saving money, and cost cutting. You know what else gets you that 700$? A 5 dollar pay raise.\n\nWant to get that much doing gig work? That's almost 15 hours a week. If you put that time into getting a certification or job searching, you could get a 3 dollar pay raise in as little a 3 months. \n\nBe smart about where you put your energy, you're not invincible, and you can sustain a life of bare minimum living forever. Use that extra energy and focus it as best you can.",

            "comment": "The reason people recommend things like getting a second job/gig work or look to cut expenses is because both of those things are much easier than finding a higher paying full-time job, as you yourself acknowledge. Finding a better job is much easier when you're not struggling day-to-day and spending cuts or picking up a bartending job or whatever are ways to get your head above water so you have the space to make more significant changes in your life.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure how working a second job is \"bullshit that will not meaningfully impact your life compared to making more money\" when working a second job is quite literally a mode of making more money.",

The reality is that part-time work has a cap on earnings, and most will not pay more than 15-20 an hour and they come an additional cost to mental and physical health, and do not come with additional benefits.\n\nAnd the harsh reality is you will not make  progress working 2 shitty jobs. If I'm constantly looking to improve my main income source, it will go up, and for the most part, it is sustainable to do for anyone up until the 80k year range. Working 2 serving jobs? I'll be stuck at the same pay rate, basically my entire career, and as I get older, and more things happen in my life my income will only go down as I can't keep working.\n\nSo when I say working 2 jobs will not improve your life, I mean they will keep you stuck where you are. Maybe there are people out there who can do it, but most can't",

If you look at my Social Security earnings record you would assume that today I am living on the edge. \n\nThe most I made from salary in any year was $53k. In the 60's my highest salary was $6800, in the 70's I topped out at $11,614.  I soared to $21k in the 80's but only for 1 year.  In the 90's I consistently made $20k plus and finally made $30k in 2 years.  It wasn't until 2005 that I made $42k in salary and topped out at $53k the year before I retired.   I was laid off in 2012 and I made $69k that year but that sum includes the $27k they paid me not to sue them.\n\nToday I am worth over $1M and living in my 8th house.  Houses are one of the routes to my current net worth.  The other key was investing in stock and consistently doing so even if all I could send was $25 that month.  \n\nBut I am frugal, lived in a co-op for 5 years, almost always had room mates or tenants and was lucky enough to have had a partner 3 times in my life for a total of 33 years.\n\nIf you are single and making $40k and live alone and drink lots of lattes, yes there is little you can do but get a better job.  But don't dash the hopes of low wage earners with your you can't make it attitude.",

The accessibility of buying property was much easier in the 1980. \n\nI'm sorry, but I don't really care if you managed to scrape by in the 1970 off a basic job, the reality is thst in today's dollars 40k is bare minimum for building any financial stability and getting to that point should be your first priority.",

It's true you can only cut back on expenses so much, and there comes a point where your time is better spent earning more money, working an extra hour, than driving out of your way to go to the slightly cheaper store, spending hours clipping coupons etc.\n\nGig work highly depends on location and the general state of the economy. Many gig workers are not taking all their expenses and taxes into the equation and coming up with what the true earnings of gig work are.\n\nImproving your skills and knowledge to get a better job still is typically one of the best ways to increase income, as well as changing employers every few years.

I didn't read fine print because of course I didn't, and didn't realize how insanely strict these contracts are and how harshly they bind. I have just recieved mail from Aldous &amp; Associates, the law-firm trying to collect my debt. What the hell do I do?",

I know the contract would hold, but I feel like I could fight it, even if I were to get sued. The way this entire system works is kinda setting you up for failure, is it not? You cannot cancel it online, you have to get a notarized letter to send to them or go in person, which is frankly fucking impossible with how busy my life is. Getting a letter from a law-firm saying I owe money when I never used the service, nor was there an easy way to cancel is rigged as hell. Unforunately, thats the way the cookie crumbles and I am young and dumb, so I have to figure it out on my own. Learning experience for sure.",

The part where you agreed to pay money?    \n\nFitness memberships are notoriously hard to exit and the crunch contract is probably very long.  When my local Crunch opened I considered it but after reading the cancellation terms i figured it would be a pain.   Looked like the kind of thing where you have to die or move 25mi away from any other crunch, and you or your estate and to send them a registered letter.",

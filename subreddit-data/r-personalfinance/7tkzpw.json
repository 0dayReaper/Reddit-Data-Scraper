    "postText": "Edit: Want someone to find you a car at a great price?\n\nAs of April 2023, I've partnered with a national auto consulting and brokerage service who can find you great deals while taking the hassle out of the process. For a reasonable fee, they'll help you figure out the best car for you and find it for you. \n\nIf you need a new or used car, buy or lease, just send me a message for more info and I'll send you their way!\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n__________________\n\nI have seen a lot of posts recently about best practices with car buying, but I haven't seen anything on _how to_ lease a car. So I figured I'd write this up! \n\nOk, let's get this out of the way right away: Leasing isn't for everyone. In fact, it's probably a bad idea for most people. But if you are going to lease, you need to know how leases work and where they get the numbers in order to get the best deal. And knowing the numbers may actually make you realize it's a terrible deal and to stay away. \n\nBut for this post, I'm not debating the merits of leasing, just explaining HOW the math works, what your costs actually are and how to realistically minimize those costs. \n\nThis post will include the following info:\n\n- The math behind the calculation\n- What kind of car to look for\n- Where to find the info you need\n- How to negotiate the best lease\n\n***The Math***    \n\nLet's start with how the lease monthly payment is calculated. \n\nThe formula is: Payment = Depreciation + Finance charge.    \nYour depreciation is: ((Capitalized Cost - Residual Value) / Number of Months)   \nYour Finance charge is: ((Capitalized Cost + Residual Value) * Money Factor   \nSo your total formula is: Payment = ((Capitalized Cost - Residual Value) / Number of Months) + ((Capitalized Cost + Residual Value) * Money Factor)\n\nPretty simple right? So what do those things mean?\n\nCapitalized cost: This is the amount financed. Did you know in a lease, you are actually financing the depreciation? This can be higher or lower than the price of the car, depending on whether or not you are putting money down, rolling over negative equity, or tacking on fees into your payment. The lower the better!\n\nResidual value: This is what the manufacturer (or the bank, if using a separate lease provider) thinks the car will be worth at the end. It's expressed as a percentage. 50% or 0.50 means they think it will be worth half as much in the end. The more miles you want, the lower the residual will be. Residual can also vary by trim package (i.e., the \"Limited\" has a higher residual than the \"Sport\"). The higher the better!\n\nMoney factor: This is the interest rate. For some reason, it's always actual interest rate / 2400. So 4% = 0.0016 and 0.9% = 0.000375. The lower (more zeroes) the better!\n\nNumber of months: How long you want to lease for. Sometimes manufacturers juice the leases depending on months. For example, VW wanted to move Jetta GLIs off their lots a few years ago, and had insanely inflated residuals and ridiculously low money factors on 2 year leases, making them about $100/mo less than a 3 year lease.\n\nRefundable security deposits: This is expert level leasing. Almost no one knows about it, even dealerships. But some banks allow you to put down a refundable security deposit in order to lower your money factor. This is usually for people with low credit to secure the rates of someone with higher credit, but some let people with top tier credit put down money to get an even lower rate. I was told by the finance manager and the sales manager at one Toyota dealership that I was wrong. I asked them to call Toyota, and they came back and said \"well, you learn something new everyday\". If you are doing a refundable security deposit, simply calculate if the reduced payment on your lease will be higher than the guaranteed return on your money. In other words, if you put down $3000 and get $20/mo off, at the end of 3 years you'll have $3000+20x36 = $3,720. That's a 7.44% guaranteed return!\n\n***Type of car to look for***   \n\nTo get the cheapest lease possible, you want to find a car that the manufacturer is discounting (this will reduce your 'cap cost'), which has a naturally high resale value (think Honda or Toyota), and a low money factor (triple zero!). \n\nYou can monitor for specials, search online for deals, or call around when you are looking for a car. If manufacturers are advertising cheap lease deals, it probably means they are either discounting the car or offering a really cheap money factor. Just realize that if it's being advertised, you can do better by negotiating. \n\nAs with anything, google is your friend as well: I got my parents a great lease deal by googling \"current lease deals\" and finding out that Mazda was basically doing interest free leases - they're driving a $30k car for $315 a month, with zero money out of pocket.\n\n***Where to get the info***   \n\nSo now you know you want to lease a car. You need to start filling in the blanks. What are the sources of this information:\n\n- Dealerships. They won't tell you easily, but if you make it clear you are a serious buyer, they'll share the real info with you. I've found that sales managers and internet departments are the most likely ones to share the info.\n- Edmunds TMV. This a great source to find out how much cars are actually selling for in your area. You can option the car and price it out and see if it's realistic to get a car below invoice or at msrp or somewhere in between.\n- CarGurus. I've found this site/app super helpful for knowing what specific cars are available in an area, what the average price is, and how long the car has sat for.\n- Edmunds vehicle specific forums. This is the best source I've found for up to date residuals and money factors. The mods of the forums answer specific questions on current vehicle offers.\n- Google. If you google \"money factor + residual + [make/model]\" you might find another source that will break it down for you. \n\nI like to find all of the numbers, plug them in, figure out what the monthly payment would be, and then start calling dealerships to confirm my numbers are right. This makes negotiation easy - figure out what you want to pay, figure out a reasonable price, and then find someone who will sell it to you for that. Speaking of...\n\n***The negotiation***   \n\nHere's where it can get tricky. Even if you know the numbers and know what you're trying to do, they'll still try and add stuff on. There are curveballs everywhere. \n\nAlso, it's going to be rare that you'll find a sales person who will dive into calculating at this level. They will ask you about monthly payment, your trade-in, what you want to pay. You need to be firm and stick to your plan. The last time I leased this led to me walking out of one dealership after they wouldn't play ball. Their loss, I walked into one the next weekend and leased the same car for LESS than I was willing to pay at the first one. \n\nThe key strategy is this: _focus on the sale price of the car_. You already know the money factor and residual. Those are driven by the bank and the dealer can't budge (unless they find you another bank). You want to negotiate the lowest sale price possible. This is where the Edmunds TMV and Cargurus info is so helpful.\n\nDo not talk about down payments. Do not talk about monthly payments. Do not talk about trade-ins. Do not talk about _anything_ except the sale price of the car.\n\nWhy is this so important? Because the residual is always calculated based on the MSRP of the car. But the closer the residual is to the sales price, the less depreciation you are financing. So the lower \"sale price\" you can base the lease on, the cheaper your payment!\n\nSome other tips to think about when negotiating: \n\n- Never put money down. All a downpayment does is reduce your cap cost. But if you drive off the lot that day and get slammed by an 18 wheeler and have the car totaled, you'll never see that money again. NEVER PUT MONEY DOWN.\n- If you can, sell your car privately. Don't trade it in on a lease. Why? See above. It's money, and it may disappear. There are obviously exceptions to everything, but in general, don't trade a car in.\n- Watch for additional fees. Dealers charge for document fees ($100-$500, may or may not be negotiable) and a host of other factors. Ask for these to be separated out, then decide if you want to lease them. When your money factor is near 0, you may be ok with \"financing\" these costs. But you may just also want to pay them up front (note: this isn't a down payment).\n- Taxes: these vary by state, but in my state they're based on a prorated lease rate. So it's a monthly payment of (6.5% x calculated monthly payment) is added on to your total payment.\n\nSo what are some real world examples:\n\nI currently lease a 2017 Toyota 4Runner Off Road Premium. The MSRP of my car is $40,500. Toyota was running a lease special of $399/mo with $2,999 down, plus taxes and fees for a base SR5 that goes for about $37k. Seems like a great deal, right? And I should be paying more for a more expensive vehicle than their current special, right?\n\nWell, I looked up on edmunds and found out that the car was actually selling for closer to $38k. Cargurus confirmed this, and also showed that several were available near me and had been sitting on lots for a couple weeks. I did some research and found out the residual was high for a 3 year, 36k mile lease (I think 65%) but the money factor was kind of meh (0.00225). Let's see the differences, using the MSRP:\n\nPayment = ((Capitalized Cost - Residual Value) / Number of Months) + ((Capitalized Cost + Residual Value) * Money Factor)\n\n((40,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = ($40,500-$26,325)/36 = $393.75 +     \n((40,500+ (40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $150 = $544/mo .   \n\nOk, now let's play around with this a little bit. Let's remove $3000 from the \"capitalized cost\" after we learn that the average Edmunds selling price is $2500 below MSRP (and we're going to negotiate a little better than average).   \n\n((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $143 = $454/mo\n\nWe just dropped almost $90 off the price by knowing what we can actually get the car priced out. How do we lower the price a little more? Turns out, Toyota will drop the MF from 0.00225 to 0.00153 if you put down $3600 in fully refundable security deposits, returned in full at the end of lease completion. Let's run the math again.\n\n((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500*.65)) x .00153) = $98 = $408/mo\n\nAnother $50 off. We dropped our interest rate from 5.4 to 3.67 and the price came down accordingly. \n\nNow, let's plug the same numbers in and push for a dream price: $36,500. That gets my payment down to $379. With a tax of 6.25%, my final payment will be ($379*.0625)+$379 = $402. Since my goal is $400, it's now to time to call some dealerships and see if they'll play ball.\n\nI took out my CarGurus app, found what was on their lots, did the exact math based on exactly how they were optioned (typed the same exact cars into Edmunds), and then made specific offers and was transparent about the info I knew:\n\n\"Hello dealer, I see you have a 2017 4runner on your lot with XYZ options. I believe the residual is 65%. My research tells me the money factor is 0.00153 with a $3600 refundable security deposit. If you'd be willing to base a lease off of a cap cost of $36,500 with no money down, then I will come in today to sign paperwork\".\n\nNotice a few things: I share numbers that show I'm serious and have done research. I make an offer and tell them I'm ready to close the deal. I don't mention monthly payment. I confirm the numbers. \n\nThe results of this effort: Two dealers were interested. One dealership told me to come in, then wouldn't move off MSRP. When I complained to head of biz dev at the dealer, he told me I obviously worked for Toyota - \"why don't you just use your own discount to order it from the factory?\". He was serious too, and said that no one who wasn't in the car industry would have the knowledge or info I had. I sent him links to CarGurus and Edmunds and never went back. The other dealer told me to come in.\n\nNow here's where it got interesting. The Sales Manager asked if I'd be open to working with another bank besides Toyota. He brought out a sheet from a local credit union and shared their numbers (this is something I've seen that happens when you make it clear you know what you're talking about and are serious about buying: they stop BS'ing you). \n\nThe money factor on this bank's lease was .00165 (3.96%). Higher than Toyota's lowest, but no security deposit. And the residual was 0.68, also higher than Toyota's.\n\n((37,500 - (40,500 x .68))/36 = $276 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .68)) x .00153) = $107 = $384/mo\n\nAnother $25! Now this is getting good. Now's when we started the real negotiation. I pushed for $36,500 and said I'd sign on the spot. We ended up settling on $36,900 after some back and forth. \n\nFinal price: $366 for the car, $23 for the tax, $389/mo total, $1500 out of pocket, $40,500 car.\nWhat was Toyota's advertised deal at the time? $399/mo, $3000 down (includes fees), for a ~$37,000 car.\n\nSo by knowing how the lease works, I got significantly more car for less money per month, no money down, and the same out of pocket costs!\n\nNow, we still had to finalize a couple other things:\n\n- Gap insurance: You need this on a lease. The bank I was leasing included it, but apparently Toyota does not. So Another $10/mo or so in savings.\n- Acquisition fee: Unfortunately, the bank makes you pay an initial fee to take possession of the car. In my instance, it was about $800, which was about $150 more than the Toyota lease. I could have added this to the cap cost and paid about $20/mo more, but I decided to pay this up front.\n- First month's payment: Varies by manufacturer, but I chose to pay this up front as well.\n- Plates, title, registration, etc: Varies by state. I paid them up front as well\n- Document fees: Dealerships often inflate these to make money, since they often don't make money on the car itself. You can push and negotiate on these, but sometimes they'll waive them and sometimes not. And if they do waive them, you'll probably pay for it in the sale price of the car. I'm ok with a business making some money, as long as I know exactly what it is. I paid this up front as well.\n\nIf I had rolled all of those fees into the lease, I would have basically been financing $1500 at 4%. Now there's the argument that if I rolled it in and got into an accident, the gap insurance would basically pay for it. Overall, it would have added about $50/mo to the cost of the lease, so I paid it all up front.\n\nSo in the end, I took possession of the car for $1500, didn't have a payment for 30 more days, and now owe $389/mo for the next 3 years on a $40k+ truck. If I want to buy it in the end, it's simply the residual cost ($27,540). If I choose to buy it out before then, it's simply a matter of getting a loan or writing a check for the current buyout price that month.\n\nSo to summarize, if you are going to lease:\n\n- Know how a lease works\n- Use your internet resources to find out the current manufacturer rates for your car, but be open to different banks\n- Learn the points to negotiate the lease on\n- Don't negotiate monthly payment\n- reach out to multiple dealerships, but be straightforward, respectful, and up front.\n- Don't put \"money down\", but realize it may make more sense to pay some things up front.\n\n\n\n***Bunch of Edits/follow-ups:*** \n\n- well, I didn't expect the front page and 2 golds (thank you!). I was just trying to do a knowledge dump that I could share if people had questions on their lease. I always assumed my pitbulls or cat would be the thing that got me to the front page.\n- the audience was /pf, which is generally against leasing. I wasn't interested in that debate, and there are plenty of sources out there to decide if a lease is for you or not, or when it makes sense and when it doesn't. Leasing isn't necessarily the cheapest way to drive (although it can be), but sometimes there's more to life than spending the least amount of money as possible to make it through your day. But there's no reason to overpay for something that you are getting, especially if understanding how it works can save you money. \n- if you are going to lease, please do more research than this post! I was just sharing what I've learned. I wanted to share the numbers from mine to show how the payment can go up and down, and then shared where I found the numbers and how I approached the process. Not trying to claim it is the *best* way, just that if you are going to lease you should understand the mechanics of it.\n- I got a few PMs and messages that I said not to put money down and then I did. This is a valid criticism. The first payment is due at some point and I'd rather use my rewards card than ACH for that, so the only out of pocket money I paid was the acquisition cost, doc fees, and title/reg, which was about $1100 total. In hindsight, I should have just rolled that all in and had a higher monthly payment. At the time my reasoning was that it's not cap cost reduction and I didn't want to \"finance\" the acquisition cost. In hindsight, the same logic applies - if the car got totaled, I'd be out that money. So do as I say, not as I do!\n- thank you to everyone who provided feedback on typos and errors. I believe I fixed all of the math format edits and mixups on switching cap cost and msrp. If you see any other errors, feel free to PM me and i'll fix them.\n- several people mentioned leasehackr.com. it's an awesome site and has a great calculator. If you aren't comfortable with building your own spreadsheet, just use theirs! They also have great breakdowns on things like the deal of the month if you are just looking at getting cheap leases.\n- as someone said in the comments, please be respectful to folks if you're buying a car. I personally think having #s and doing research makes it easy for everyone because it removes the \"is this guy BS'ing me?\" part. Even the dealership that I walked out of in frustration, I thanked the sales guy for his time and told him to call me if his sales manager was willing to budge on price. But the dealer i did buy from, the sales manager said \"you'd be surprised how many people think I'm trying to screw them when I offer leasing through our 3rd party bank\".\n\nAnd finally, I'll say it again: if you are going to lease, please research beyond this post. Don't make 3 year commitments for thousands of dollars based on one guy's post! Hopefully my post helps you understand a little more how it works and provides a starting  point for research, but it wasn't meant as a be all and end all comprehensive guide!",

Also, when you lease the dealer takes the risk of any extra depreciation. Take my recent lease of a Nissan leaf for instance. Residual is 14.5k and the car goes for about 10k now. It was hit with crazy depreciation and all I paid was 7k during the term of the lease on a ~22k purchase price (after incentives from the Fed). If I had purchased this car I would be out that additional 4.5k",

I see that a lot with folks who take out particularly long purchase terms on used cars, or who have lifestyle changes necessitating a new car, like having kids or changing jobs with a commute or something like that. \n\n\nWith a lease, even if you choose to buy the car for the residual value at the end of your lease, (this makes a ton of sense if you're buying a car that holds its value crazy well but don't have the flexibility for a full purchase payment when you're in the market, I.E., OP's Tacoma or a Subaru Outback or WRX), your negative equity is gone. You take it on the chin for about 3 years, and it's over, whether or not you choose to keep the car. ",

By the time the 'warranty' expires, you can return the car and get a new lease with a new' warranty'. So by leasing a car, you've always be on factory warranty. Now, if you buy a car, its highly unlikely that you'd switch cars after 36 months as you'd still be making payments (typical car loan is for 60 months), at which point, a serious mechanical issue could pop up, but the factory warranty has expired. What happened to your mom's van is not common and leasing the car couldn't have prevented that. Seems like a major defect ",

And 9 years from now, your 15 year old car with 150k miles probably isn't going to be worth much more than a couple grand.\n\nLeasing is bad if you use it to get into an expensive car you can't afford.

Of course that's highly dependent on the exact terms of any given deal.  And since most off-the-shelf lease offers to Joe consumer are designed to fleece Joe, that's why leasing has a bad name.  But in businesses where both the leasee and leasor have financial professionals working and can't really fleece each other too badly, leasing is common for equipment, which general loses value every day of it's life.

It will help you immensely. \n\nhttps://leasehackr.com\n\nThe reasons I suggest this site are below. \n\nIt has a calculator. The calculator allows you to understand if a dealer is giving you correct numbers quickly. It is a good idea to understand how to calculate lease payments though. \n\nThere is a forum where other people that lease cars post the deals they got. Sometimes brokers post and they can get the best deal. \n\nThey frequently link to the Edmonds forum where current manufacturers rebates and money factors are listed for different vehicle makes and models. \n\nI\u2019d like to add one more thing. Some people on here apparently hate leasing. I own an suv outright. We use it to go to the beach with the dog and haul stuff home from Home Depot. We also lease a new Lexus. I love leasing a car and so does my wife she gets a new car every 3 years with all the maintence covered and it is under warranty. Just because leasing isn\u2019t the most frugal option doesn\u2019t make it a bad option. Newer vehicles are many times safer with more safety features and new technologies (our Lexus will attempt to stop itself if it detects an impending crash) (it alerts you to cross traffic and has blind spot monitoring) . If one of those features keeps my wife alive or prevents us from being sued due to an accident it was a worthwhile expenditure to have a new vehicle. ",

            "comment": "A few other tips:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Lease equity** - Never Never Never turn in the vehicle without checking its current market value (dealers use NADA guides). If the market value of your car is worth more than the buyout price at any given time during the lease period, you can use it to your leverage and use this equity as capitalized cost reduction towards a new vehicle. This often happens when you significantly drive under your miles allowance, or the car is simply now worth more than what your lease buyout paperwork says (for a variety of other reasons that is too complicated to get into).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Multiple Security Deposits** - I am not a fan of these. One of the major advantages of a lease is to use as little upfront cash capital as possible to secure the rental terms of a depreciating asset. If you go crazy on MSD reductions, you can actually tie up thousands of dollars for 36 months in reducing not much interest. You need to compare the savings over the lease period vs the opportunity cost of that deposit money could possibly generate over the same period.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**At the Dealership** - Most salepeople on the floor are not that financial literate but be respectful to them. To not waste any time, have your spreadsheet printed out with all the terms (price, residual, money factor, cap reduction,  calculated payment etc.) and hand it to the the salesperson and say \"I know exactly what I am doing, I'd like to walk out of here with a car today in 60 minutes if you make it easy for the both of us,  please hand this spreadsheet to your sales manager\".  This pretty much signals the sales person to cut the bullshit, and if they value their time, they get to make $150 in an hour and move onto the next customer. Also, go in during busy times like a weekend so they have less of an incentive to waste your time because any time they spend with you is time could be spent on other customers (who aren't as financially literate and thus potentially higher profit margins) walking through the door. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Finance Everything** (if the rate makes sense) - you can walk out the dealership with only paying the first month payment.  Lease acquisition, registration/title, etc. can all be rolled into the monthly payments. If the interest rate is favorable, why not take advantage of that? In fact, if there is an interest free or near interest free money factor on the particular vehicle model you want to buy, definitely roll all of that in. Make your own money do something else that will generate higher returns. ",

In my example, I wanted a 4runner, so I wanted to do whatever to reduce the interest rate, and $3600 would but almost 2 points. If I was just going for cheapest lease, I'd just go to a manufacturer offering near zero MFs (it's why my parents keep driving Mazdas).\n- great point on the dealership. Inevitably, your transaction will involve directly talking to the sales manager. In my lease experience, the finance manager has become involved on more than one occasion to show the sales manager how to actually do the math. \n\nThe dealership I walked out of ended with the sales guy saying \"hey, if you can't afford $500/mo, maybe a 4runner isn't for you. Maybe a Camry makes more sense?\" I tried to give him my business but he didn't want it!    \n\n- totally agree here. I rolled everything into my parents Mazda with a less than 1% interest rate (mazda also paid the first month payment). I went back and forth on it at 3.96%, and decided to pay it up front. Again, if I was going for cheapest lease possible, I'd be in a different car and would absolutely have rolled it in.\n\nEither way, the most important thing is to truly understand what you're paying for so that you can weigh the difference!",

The sales manager mostly enters the numbers into a templated spreadsheet to see if the numbers can turn into a deal that they will accept. The F&amp;I manager actually understands the finance math and signs the paperwork at the end.  I have a spreadsheet template that mimics closely to that of a Sales Manager's template. For the most part, once my sheet is brought into the Sales Manager by the Salesperson,  I ask the Sales Manager just to simply type in all the parameters to see if they get the same monthly payment numbers as I do and whether they will accept the deal. Sometimes I would also help the Sales Manager to construct certain deal parameters in the format of their spreadsheeet if they are not well-versed in it, like rolling lease acquisition into monthly payments instead of having it as a cash line item. The more confidence you can project yourself in front of them, the less time they will waste of yours. Their mentality is basically \"I am probably not going to make much profit on this deal, but it is one more deal towards my monthly goal, and I can get it done within the hour so I can move onto the next customer with bigger profit margins\". \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt the end of the day, you do not need to have a finance degree to understand leasing. Most people are intimidated at car dealerships because they think they will get swindled, but if just you spend a few hours of effort learning the mechanics of leasing (all publicly available info), you will actually be more informed than most salespeople that work at the dealership and in turn, have the upperhand in any transactions.

My buy out is higher in the end, but given the lower monthly payment (and lack of down payment), I decided it was worth it. \n\nWe will probably know in about a year or so if we decide to buy it out, so the lease on this one may end sooner anyway.\n\nEdit: I'll edit my post and add your clarification when I get a chance!",

You are correct that none of the salespeople even know how this works, but you may be surprised to find out that very few sales managers or finance managers know this either. It's not like they have to do the calculations by hand; they just plug it in to the computer and it spits out numbers.\n\nThe only quibble I will offer because I am a stickler is that the finance charge IS NOT INTEREST. That is why it is usually expressed as a money factor and is usually disclosed on a lease contract as a \"rent charge\". It does not amortize, and is front loaded. This is part of the reason that you should never put down cash up front. Not only are you putting that money at risk if the vehicle is totalled, but you aren't saving a penny of finance charge, just pre-paying your payments.\n\nThe calculation you mentioned is helpful to convert a money factor to a roughly equivalent interest rate, but only as a frame of reference for people that aren't familiar with money factors. A layperson might guess that .00041 is better than .00151, but it helps them grasp it better to see that it is like paying .98% vs 3.64%",

Speaking from experience, a dealership never beat me in terms of price even if that\u2019s the dealership I\u2019m getting the customer\u2019s car from. The reason for this is that good brokers will work with departments in dealerships that are specifically meant to push cars out of the dealership. \n\n- you should know the fees you are paying upfront (if you chose this option) should really only be your first month\u2019s payment, the bank fee (charged by your lienholder), DMV fee (registration/plates) and whatever other applicable fee for your state is. Doc fees are sometimes incurred if a dealership needed to do a swap to get your car (from another state), but this is a rare occurrence.\n\n-  November/December and May/June are the months with the most rebates/incentives available for cars across every manufacturer. Try to lease during these months to get the cheapest rates you can.",

I would have leased my 2018 mustang but Ford won't let you lease a 5.0 V8.\n\nAnyway, putting your money into something that depreciates is bad in the first place, but everyone needs transportation. \n\nLeasing allows you to have a the nicest and newest model out every 2-3 years. Do people need to get a new car every 2-3 years? Of course not! But it is nice. Especially since you're payments are typically $100/$150 less a month on a lease. \n\nLet me put it this way.. Lets say you lease a car and you agree to a 25k residual(what it will be worth at the end of the lease) now lets say the manufacturer stops producing that car, the value plummets. What if that model car gets a new design overhaul? The value plummets. What if that new transmition in that model turns out to have a ton of issues? The value plummets. There are a lot of factors that comes into play that effects a cars value. Of course this isn't going to be something you have to worry about with every car. The actual depreciation does not really matter when you go to turn in the lease.  Because assuming you stayed under the miles you agreed to and you didn't beat the car to shit. You pretty much just drop the keys off and it's said and done. \n\nI deal with so many jaw dropping negative equity situations it would make you sick. I've seen people that are anywhere from 6k-10k negative on their financed car. In extreme cases I've seen a few people 20k negative on an auto loan. Of course these cases are caused mostly by people who made more than a few bad decisions in the past... negative equity is a bitch. Lets say you financed a 2014 model year back in 2015 and now in 2018 you've got 3k negative equity and you want to get a new car. You've got to either tack that negative on a new car, putting you even further in the negative equity hole, or you've got to find someone that's willing to overpay for your car on Craigslist which probably isn't going to happen. If you owe 8k and it's worth 6k at best, before you sell it you've got to make that 2k disappear some how. \n\nThis is something you don't have to worry about in a lease. Again assuming you have a strong understanding of your driving habits (how many miles you drive a year) you get a new car every 2-3 years + Lower payment + your cars will always be under warranty while you own it and that's not just powertain that's bumper to bumper coverage. You're literally just paying for gas and insurance.",

It\u2019s also why you have to carry higher limits of liability on your auto insurance with a lease vs a retail purchase. \nGAP insurance only kicks in, in the event of a total loss. At which point it is only needed if the amount to payoff your vehicle is more than the dollar amount the insurance company is going to pay for your vehicle. GAP insurance does not refund down payment money, get the insurance company to pay more, or get you money if you are in an accident but the car is not totaled.  It also does not affect the money factor of the lease, which is the finance charge. \n",

At that point, maybe you get some back but I don't think they're obligated to return all of your money.\n\nGap insurance is included with my bank, and I believe with most manufacturers. I don't think lowering the gap on the gap insurance would significantly reduce the cost. It's dollars a month, not hundreds of dollars.\n\nAlso, I don't actually think a discount on a lease by paying it all up front is an actual thing.",

It's actually a really good idea if you plan to get a new vehicle every few years. Only time I tell someone to finance instead of lease is if they drive too much, modify their car, or are getting into a vehicle that holds it's value super well. Enjoy the new 4Runner, and very nice on working the numbers so well!",

The thing is that a new car is generally a poor financial decision because that is the time when you will suffer from the most depreciation. You pay that depreciation either way if you lease or buy a new car. If you buy a used car, someone else has already paid that depreciation, which works out well for the cost-conscious buyer.",

That is a trick dealerships pull, they base the residual off Sale Price not MSRP.\n\nExample: MSRP is $30,000 USD, Purchase Price is $23,000 after discounts and rebates.  The 50% residual should be $15,000 with Depreciation of $8000.  The wrong calculation would be to change the MSRP to negotiated Sale Price, then residual would be $11,500 and depreciation would be $11,500.\n\nThe lease company will not give you a final buyout at $11,500 they will require the full MSRP residual of $15,000.\n\nMSRP = Sticker before dealer add-ons, or additional dealer markup (market price adjustment).\n\nBest lease value is cars that have been on the lot for a while and have a high MSRP/Sale Price ratio. \nMy last lease was a 2014 bought after 2015's came out.  There was no special financing required see below.\n\nMy lease was MSRP $32,995 * 55% = $18,147.25 Residual.  Sale price after rebates and incentives was $23,800, making my depreciation $5652.75 + $750 lease fee  + $187 license and registration + 658.98 Tax = $7248.93.  I paid the whole amount upfront with a combination of trade in and cash, so my payment was $0 for 2 years.\n\nThis is a rare deal, I doubt finding $10k off a $30k car happens often, but this one had sat on the lot for a long time and the conditions were perfect.",

FCA does not own their own finance or leasing, and have to use a third party for their lease vehicles (usually SCI leasing) \n\nThis is unfortunate because now the 3rd party controls the interest rate, and residual value, and of course, would also like to make money on your deal, above any gross profit the dealership may be making. \n\nIf you're considering a compass, consider the consumer reports on this vehicle, as it does not score well on reliability, and the residual value may be quite low. (Rav4 provides similar options with much better reliability and resale) \n\nIf you are considering a Cherokee, be mindful of the fact the 2019's just received a mid-model update. \nThis will mean the 2018s will be largely incentivised as soon as the 2019s arrive (later this year). \n\nThe only Jeep product I have seen do well on a lease deal would be the Wrangler. 90% of the time these vehicles will carry positive equity at the end of the lease. \n\nI am a jeeper myself, however I went the route of finance, as jeep was offering 0% at the time. \n\nSide note, do some research into the 9-speed transmission in the Cherokee. Jeep says it has addressed rough shifting issues in the 2019 update, as previous models were plagued with complaints of bumpy and unrefined shifts at low speeds. ",

Combined with dealer discounts and tax incentives we were able to lease a few cars for less than my cellphone bill every month. \n\nThe best one was a 2014 BMW i3 with $50,350 msrp. The residual was 63% on a 24 month lease. I negotiated a $9k dealer discount, $1k BMW coupon, then there was a $7,500 federal tax incentive applied to the cap cost. Also afterwards our state had a $5,000 tax rebate where they just sent us a check. So after sales tax and registration the car cost us $1,500 for 24 months or about $65/month. Also electricity cost us about 1/8 of what gas does and they also  included maintenance. The only thing I had to buy was a new set of rear tires since I have a heavy foot. We actually got two of these BMW deals. \n\nA few on the i3 FB group were able to get a $12k dealer discount so actually made a small profit. \n\nAfter these leases were over we got a Tesla Model S but the Tesla money factors are outrageous so we just bought it. It was a showroom car with 18 miles, basically never driven, but they discounted it by $10k plus the $7,500 federal tax credit. MSRP $78k net cost ~$61k. If you can find a good showroom discount (~$40k) and get them during a time where they are subsiding the money factor, it was possible to get a P90D for about $700/month plus tax on a 2 year lease.\n\nFor our second car we are getting the Model 3, picking up next week, paying full price but will also get the $7,500 tax credit.

I was ecstatic, since it was the price I wanted and, by trading it in, I got to deduct that $2500 from the final price of the car I was buying and subsequently pay less sales tax (~$170).  \n\nSo in general, I completely agree that selling privately is better.

For example:\n&gt;\nPayment = ((Capitalized Cost - Residual Value) / Number of Months) + ((Capitalized Cost + Residual Value) * Money Factor)\n((40,500 - (40,500*.65))/36 = ($40,500-$26,325)/36 =\n$393.75 + ((40,500+(40,500.65)).00225) = $150 = $544/mo\n\nI can't follow this at all, you are putting + and - and = signs all in the wrong places.

You paid a lot in doc fees and acquisition fees that can often be negotiated out.\n\nSo in essence you got car price discount in exchange for paying other exorbitant fees.  That's not much different than the guy who gets a lot of that waived, but pays a higher car price.  \n\nAnd you *did* pay up front, plus you also made a day 0 first payment, which you spun as \"didn't have a payment for 30 days\".  That's not a feature, everyone gets 30 days in between payments.  You essentially put $1889 down.\n\nYes, you negotiated a better deal than the initial one advertised.  But everybody does that to some extent.  \n\nIf you're looking for big savings, right time of year can be as beneficial, or even additive to your tips.  Buy when the fattest model year end factory incentives are available.  On loaded models there can be several thousand dollar reductions the dealer just gets to claim, so they don't even fight you on them.  Sometimes careful timing is necessary to get the newest/biggest incentive right when it comes out, but before depreciation values are reset. I wouldn't be surprised if part of the residual value difference you aced was because the credit union wasn't as up to the minute on their values.  The credit union probably also kicks the dealer a better origination fee than the other one, so that might be why they recommended it.\n\n\n\n",

They can pick anything they want. No deposit, no money down, no anything. Insurance is free. The title in the glove box says Toyota Motor Company and the insurance card says Tokyo Fire and Casualty or something.\n\nImmediate relatives can lease cars cheap. If I recall it was like 1% of what Toyota would sell the car to a dealership for per month. Again, no money down, insurance is free. car is owned by Toyota Motor Company and insured by a fire dept in Tokyo, lol.\n\nThey were all 2 year / 20,000 mile leases. There was no penalty for miles. You simply had to turn the car in for a new one. So in practice the more you drove the more new cars you could get.\n\nMy dad would get new cars about every 18 months due to mileage. My mom would get one every 2 years. You had to order about 4-6 months in advance if you wanted to pick the options. You could get one faster by taking one that was already on the water and not sold yet. So in practice growing up, getting new cars or talking about ordering a new car was an ongoing event.\n\nI got a brand new 4Runner when I turned 16. My dad probably paid less for the lease for it than he would have for just my insurance on the car if he had had to pay that.",

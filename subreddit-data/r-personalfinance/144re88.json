    "postText": "I have been house hunting for a while, but haven\u2019t found the right place. I may need some cash for renovations and furniture if I actually close on a place. I\u2019ve been keeping money for this in a savings account for the time being. I have a taxable investment account that has long term gains in VTSAX (total stock market index fund). If I wanted to invest the money I currently have set aside in VTSAX, I should be able to sell my shares that have long term gains (only pay long term capital gains tax) and not have to really worry if the market goes up or down right? (Assuming the market doesn\u2019t significantly go down and those long term gains would turn into a loss).",

I would rather take the chance keeping my money in a total stock index fund with the possibility for higher gains. My investment strategy is still higher risk for higher reward. \nI have enough long term gains to cover any money that I would need for the house (money I would be investing now).",

You might not be taking a loss on the dollars you invested earlier, but you *are* securing a loss compared to if you put the money into a HYSA for that time (money you have today is up 20%, then the market falls 10% and you pull out to buy a house, you just lost 10% when you could've been up 4-5% on a HYSA).  \n\nIdeally, what you're wanting to do works best when you don't have a firm timeline. If the market is down when you're ready to buy, but you're willing to wait a year or two (or more) for it to recover before pulling money out, that's when investing your down payment can be worth it.  \n\nBut ultimately, if you're willing to take the risk of pulling money out when it's down, then do what you want.",

    "postText": "I make bi weekly contributions to my Roth IRA, and usually invest it right away. However, I let it build up and have 3k cash sweep uninvested right now. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t time the market \ud83d\ude05, but VTTSX is nearly at its 52 week high so I\u2019m tempted to wait/hope for it to fall a bit. \n\nShould I just invest it now?\n\nEdit: \nOkay, I\u2019m going to invest it today. Next question: I have 24K in a target date (VTTSX) and it charges $75 transaction fee, but I also want to get into something like VOO which is $0 fee. Might it be better to dump it into VOO or similar now?",

SWTSX is the Schwab version. FSKAX is the fidelity version. They're basically the same thing. If you buy the vanguard version from within your Schwab account they'll charge you a fee. But you can buy the Schwab version with no fee. So just Google the Schwab version of the fund you've been buying and switch to that. It's literally as simple as \"VTSAX equivalent Schwab\". It'll save you a ton of money in the long run.",

If the reason they are worried is because they want to make the optimal choice, then following your strategy would specifically make that impossible - it would make the lows higher, but the highs lower.\n\nBut yes if they are just trying to limit the risk of a bad decision, then it would be reasonable to split.",

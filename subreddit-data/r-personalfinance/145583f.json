The only liabilities that I have is a car note seating at 8K with a 2.99 APY and student loans that is roughly 80K with an approx 7 APY. Additionally, I have 22K saved in HYSAs and 50-52K in IRA.\n\nI want to learn and do better. Thank you so much!",

            "comment": "Congratulations for saving the money you have.  Most at your age haven\u2019t done this.   It you really want to build wealth and retire early you need to open a brokerage account and seek out higher returning investments.   You\u2019re young, you need to be looking at S&amp;P Index funds (500 or 600), Growth and Income Funds, and ideally have some individual stocks.  \n\nLive below your means, take less expensive vacations, drive older cars, eat out less, etc.  increase your savings amount 1% per year or more.  \n\nFinally, if you don\u2019t own a home you need to buy one.  Homes are great assets and appreciate over time.  Get it paid off before you retire and you\u2019ll have lots of options.  \n\nI\u2019ll be retiring at 57.  It just sucks that health insurance is so expensive.",

    "postText": "A few years ago, while I was still in school (currently about to graduate), I received a large windfall (seven figures). I have never been a big spender and have not used the money on any huge purchase. That said, this has brought an enormous sense of security. Currently, the money is stored in a couple of Vanguard-type accounts and I'm treating it like a healthy retirement account that I would like to grow.\n\nI am in my late-20s and recently received an accepted an offer my first post-graduate job. It's in a field that I am very excited about, the coworkers seem really great, the job is secure with nice benefits, and does not seem like it would be particularly draining outside of work. The pre-tax salary is 95k, which (other than the windfall) is the most I have ever made. I live in, and will continue to live in a HCOL where I expect my rent to be between 2-2.5k per month.\n\nI am single, no kids, do not have any debt, and am generally healthy with no chronic diseases that require substantial financial input.\n\nI've read through a couple of guides on windfalls from back when I received this money, and I am a fan of the idea that I (1) do not telling anyone and (2) for the most part live as if the money does not exist. This would ordinarily mean putting off a significant chunk of my income to retirement, emergency funds, etc. I do want to be honest with myself, however, and part of this means that my month-to-month earnings feel extremely insignificant (despite a very comfortable salary) relative to the money that I have recently come into.\n\nWhat is a good way to budget given these background circumstances? If anyone has any similar experiences or other thoughts to share I'd love to hear them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "postText": "I'm considering buying a home vs continuing to rent crappy apartments with the $82-$84k I will be receiving soon. How would that work? Is it still taxable income if it goes into home buying? I know doing so relieves me of the 10% penality for using the money before retirement but idk how it works on taxes. Would this be a smart decision? Taking a loan against the amount is not an option as I am self employed so I could not get the money directly withdrawn from my pay check but is that an option if I'm able to make month payments via direct payment every week? Just trying to decide if this would be a better option than rolling into a 401k and continuing to rent apartments that are just crap because that's what I qualify for. I make roughly $3k a month and 2bed in my area is around $950(low income) up to $1400 which I don't qualify for. I was figuring if I purchased a home for around $180k and used this money down I'd be looking at payments around the $1400 range. Thanks for any advice",

You\u2019d only net about $67k after federal tax withholding. \n\nHow old are you?  What other retirement assets do you have? Can you afford property taxes, and maintaining the house you\u2019d buy?  I\u2019d hate to see you transfer $80k in retirement assets into a house, and then not significantly improve your cash-flow situation.",

I do make enough to support the extra costs of owning vs buying and I will also be going back to school for either nursing or biochemistry to look into lab work. The home I would be considering is a duplex. It's big enough for us (my kids and I) while renting out the next space to cover some costs and I do have significant savings in addition to cover repair costs. I don't bank on this but additionally with my bf who would not be on the mortgage our monthly income is around $6k divided equally between us both and we've been together for a little over a year. It's just that here in my town the best apartments available to fit our needs we can't qualify for (self employment I haven't started paying taxes on because its new and my first payment quarterly is due in Aug) so we have to rent based off his income and the best we can do is less than $1,000m and those apartments are just trash. If it's our only options then it is what it is but it also sucks to have this money sitting here and only being able to place us in the basic ghetto of our town. I cannot move away from town due to custody",

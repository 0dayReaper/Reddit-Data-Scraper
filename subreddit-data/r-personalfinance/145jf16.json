    "postText": "I recently increased my income from 30k to 130k and am still recovering from being poor. I recently learned that my vehicle needs a $2100 repair (lowest of 3 quotes) in order to pass emissions test in the state I've recently moved to. The vehicle is a 2007 Camry with 185k miles on it and needs no other major work. The KBB value is about $2900. I have never bought a new car and honestly have zero desire to go tens of thousands of dollars into debt just to buy one.\n\nI live in a very high cost of living area and because I only very recently had this income jump, I am terrified of unexpected expenses so I'm frantically building up my emergency fund.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy budget:\n\ntake-home: $7400\n\nstudent loan payments: $1200 (will not budge on this - very high interest loans)\n\nrent: $2700 (as a farm girl living in the city this physically hurts me)\n\nRoth IRA + HSA: $700\n\nbrokerage account (Schwab robo-advising): $800\n\nHYSA: $700\n\nutilities: $300 \n\ngroceries: $550\n\nother: $450\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now I only have $7000 in savings, about one month's income, and not enough of an emergency fund for me to feel comfortable as I do not have much job security (I work at a startup). I'd love to just keep my car, but throwing a few thousand at a car worth only 2.9 seems silly. At the same time, I can't fathom going into intense debt just for a car, and it seems the minimum for a reliable car that will last a few years is 10K. The thought of spending that much makes me literally nauseous. \n\nRe the utility of driving a car in the city, it's absolutely not efficient, but I would really like to keep having one - I like having a gym routine in the morning before public transit runs, and I also have family \\~1h  outside of the city that I see a few times a week, and I really like having that freedom.\n\nI know this is such a first world problem but would appreciate advice. Thanks!",

You only use the car occasionally for pleasure and take public transit for work. Don't waste money on a new car.",

Just be sure to you keep up on the maintenance. You would fee real dumb dumping that money into the car to then foolishly leave it a state of disrepair to the point something like the transmission or engine goes.\n\nIt\u2019s almost always cheaper to keep and repair a car than buy a new one.",

Used cars are just fine -- vehicles are made to run well over 200k miles these days. Pay cash, NEVER finance the vehicle.",

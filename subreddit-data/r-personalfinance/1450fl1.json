Credit monitoring/management would be a plus.  \n\n\nI\u2019m hoping some of you might have some insights into what works well (or should be avoided).",

But it\u2019s involved and don\u2019t think it\u2019s suitable for aging parents to use if they\u2019re likely to not stay on top of it.\n\nHowever someone else can easily do that remotely, like you.\n\nIf all you want is a consolidated ledger of all the transactions across their cards, why is mint not a good option?  My understanding is that it\u2019s what it does.  \n\nPpl also mention personal capital but I haven\u2019t used it",

It\u2019s seriously game changing in terms of giving you the visibility and control over where your money is going.  It\u2019s saved me tons of money by allowing me to see what I actually spend and give me the confidence yo invest more for the long term.",

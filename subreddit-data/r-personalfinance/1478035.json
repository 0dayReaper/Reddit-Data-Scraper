    "postText": "Looking for a bit of advice. I have a general direction of where I need to go but some recent news just created a time line. \n\nWife and I have been discussing growing our family from one child to two, and agreed this would require upgrading our housing. From two bedroom to three. Just kinda put it in the back of my mind until low and behold\u2026 she\u2019s pregnant. Excited but definitely feel some pressure. \n\nAlso in the last month I received a raise of roughly 20%. So I had the anticipation of just chipping away at my debt. Now strategizing for a quicker path. \n\nQuick info:\n\nWells Fargo CC # 1 - 30% - 7.5k limit - 7k debt\n\nWF CC # 2 - 25% - 6k limit - 5.5k debt\n\nDiscover Card - 22% - 9.5k limit - 8k debt\n\nMy credit score was lingering around 720 but over the last year my income supported the family while my wife was in between jobs, hence the debt/limit ratio. Other than debt ration. No late payment or outstanding debts. Only hit is the high ratio. Now it 660. My wife is back to work so credit cards will be collecting dust. \n\nI have 6k in savings. 25k in 401k (will not touch) \n\nThe goal is to raise the credit score as quickly as possible. \n\nMy questions. \n\n1) The 6k savings, I intend on pulling it and putting it toward my 30% interest card. Having the plan to buy a new house within 12 months, should i save it? Long run I\u2019ll pay more but is it a better resource to have than to lower my monthly interest payment and will it significant impact my credit score?\n\n2) balance transfer credit card? At 21 months 0% I can put a significant dent in my debt without incurring more interest payments. Is this worth it? This will increase my debt/limit ratio and help reduce my debt. (I understand the discipline involved to take full advantage of this) but will this be a positive come credit runs for mortgage loan? How does this effect your credit? \n\nAny other thoughts and resource greatly appreciated. \n\nAs far as budget, generally have about $700 of \u201cfree\u201d cash a month. I intended on putting as much of this towards debt as much as possible.",

The goal is to wipe CC debt, yes, but I still want to be in position to purchase a home once it\u2019s paid. This isn\u2019t my first house purchase, I anticipate my equity carrying me into the next homes down payment. So I\u2019m not sure how import liquid saving are and I want the highest credit possible going into pre approval. Would any hit I get from balance transfer on my score negatively impact that?",

Many people look to tap the equity in their homes to pay off cc debt, this is whitewashing the problem and letting it fester and rot.  Instead, you are looking to tackle the debt head on, so good on you.\n\nThat being said, your financial situation is currently tenuous.  Your savings rate is from what I can tell very low.  You want to significantly up this rate and ensure you have a solid cash cushion not only for an emergency fund (to prevent cc usage) but also to cover potential home maintenance.",

During that time, your total credit card balance will incur an additional $5k in interest alone. You said you have $700 a month leftover? Guess what, $700\\*9=$6,300, ie. your $700 is barely making a dent on these cards after paying interests from now until your baby is due, when your expenses will likely balloon, thus cutting out most of your $700.\n\nClear all personal debt is the priority then save up for your baby, not thinking about a house.",

Having the plan to buy a new house within 12 months, should i save it? \n\nNo, you are currently in an emergency right now until you pay off your cc debt.  I would put all but $1000 or so into your cc and continue paying it off, and if another emergency arises use your cc to pay for it.  Rinse and repeat until your debt is gone.\n\nOnce you eliminate your cc debt then and only then would I even consider buying a house.\n\n&gt;At 21 months 0% I can put a significant dent in my debt without incurring more interest payments.

It lowers your utilization rate (what you're calling debt ratio).\n\n&gt;As far as budget, generally have about $700 of \u201cfree\u201d cash a month.

Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors. Your credit score will take care of itself when debt comes down.\n\nUse only no annual fee credit cards that offer points or cash back. Use them only for essential items. ALWAYS pay off the balance every month and you should be good building up your credit history. Stay disciplined and live within your means.",

You have to clear this before you will be in any kind of position to talk about a house upgrade.  \n\nGet on a strict spending budget, sell assets, work extra, whatever you have to do....but clear the CC debt.  Then, stay on the strict budget, and plow all those dollars that went into your CC debt cycle into savings until those dollars, plus your current home equity, will let you comfortably purchase a home with a mortgage of &lt;25% of your take home pay.  Anything over that, especially with kids, is going to make your life way more stressful than it needs to be.\n\nBuckle down and suffer now, you and your family will be much better off in the future.",

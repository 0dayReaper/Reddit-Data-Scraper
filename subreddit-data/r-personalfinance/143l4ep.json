    "postText": "I'm a lower middle class male (28) and I need to know how to grow my wealth. I live in Texas. \n\n My salary is $58k pre tax. After taxes, medical/life insurance, Roth, and misc things, I only see $42k deposited (26 payments byweekly of $1610). \n\nI grew up in poverty and my dad taught me very little about money. He was always very frugal with his money so I learned that from him. \n\nAll of my expenses are about $1,000 a month combined. I own the property that I live on and my car is payed off. I have $0 in debt but I do have 4 credit cards that I use for everything then pay off every month before the statement/interest hits. \n\nFor cash, I have $3800 in Amex HYSA at 4.0% APY. I use that as a quasi investing/savings/emergency fund. I also (stupidly) invested $9,000 in stocks that are now worth $5,700 (I haven't sold the stock) Vanguard information Technology ETF (VGT). \n\nWhat are some recommendations going forward? Should I sell stock and reposition? Should I get out of stocks altogether? Are CDs a better alternative? What do you guys think?\n\nEDIT: What do you guys think about getting a loan for a Tax Deed(s)? I'm really handy with fixing and building things so fixing a rundown house won't be a problem.",

            "comment": "First, make sure you have a handle on your expenses.  You say your income is $42,000 per year, net, and your expenses are $12k.  That's a difference of $30k per year you should have left over.  But you have less than $15k in savings/investments right now.  So  unless you just started this job this year, you likely have money going out that you haven't accounted for.\n\nBut in general, take a read through the wiki, particularly, [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing)",

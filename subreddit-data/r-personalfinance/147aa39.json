    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nBasic question: Does it ever make sense to invest in mutual funds outside your 401k before you've maxed out the 401k?\n\nMy situation is: 35F, not married, no kids. Current salary just under $90k. Currently contribute 15% to retirement and receive a 7.5% company match, and the balance across my retirement accounts is about $160K right now (between the 401k and a Roth I moved money into when I changed jobs). Also upped my HSA contributions this year, not quite maxing out yet, but getting close. I have a mortgage of about $145K at a 3.3% interest rate and don't see myself moving anytime soon.\n\nI was thinking recently about taking a stab at a bit of investing outside my Roth/401k, with the idea of this being sort of a \"medium-long term\" account for a 15-20 year timeframe, that I could access in my 50s before I start taking anything out of retirement accounts. Right now my goal would be to use it for renovating a family lake property that I'll eventually inherit, but that could change depending on where life takes me in the future. \n\nIf I'm not aiming for FIRE, and planning to work till 60-65, should I be focusing on maxing out my 401k first, or if I'm still contributing regularly, enough to get the match and beyond, can I play a little bit with extra money that comes my way? Based on the calculations I've seen, at my current pace I'm likely on track to end up with somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million by retirement, so I feel like I have a little wiggle room. But I'd be curious to hear any considerations I should weigh as I'm thinking about this.",

            "comment": "I did something similar, I wasn't able to max out 401k and IRA for a while, but I still put money in a brokerage to use before I hit the required age to withdraw retirement funds.\n\nI know there are some ways around those age requirements but this worked for me.  Plus now I am in a position to max out retirement as well.",

            "comment": "Two thoughts:\n\nFirst, every \"extra\" dollar that you contribute to a retirement account today is one fewer dollar that you will need to contribute later. Actually, that \"extra\" dollar likely frees up more than one future dollar of retirement contributions, because the dollar contributed today has time to grow. An extra $1,000 contributed this year could mean $2,000, or $3,000, or possibly even $5,000 that you don't need to contribute in 2043, thus freeing that income to be spent on something else. And because the growth of that $1,000 investment was in a tax-advantaged retirement account, you won't owe any extra capital gains taxes on it like you would have if you had actually made the investment in a non-retirement brokerage account. You essentially end up with the same balance of investments and spendable cash, just in a more tax-efficient arrangement.\n\nSecond, Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn at any time without tax or penalty. Obviously this means you should max out your Roth IRA before making any taxable investments, but I also think it means you should strongly consider starting or increasing Roth 401(k) contributions in lieu of taxable contributions. If you leave your current employer within those next 20 years then you can roll your Roth 401(k) balance into a Roth IRA, at which point all of your Roth 401(k) contributions become Roth IRA contributions and thus can be withdrawn without tax or penalty. Even if you don't leave this employer before then, every extra Roth 401(k) contribution that you make effectively \"unlocks\" an equal amount of Roth IRA contributions that you can withdraw for non-retirement purposes without setting back your progress on retirement savings.\n\nSo while I do think it can be reasonable to put some money into non-retirement accounts before you are maxing out all tax-advantaged retirement space, I would also encourage you to consider how you could utilize that remaining retirement contribution space to achieve the same non-retirement goals in a more tax-efficient manner.\n\nAlso, don't count out 401(k) loans as another way to pay for non-retirement expenses with retirement plan money. A 401(k) loan is effectively a way to *temporarily* sell and withdraw up to $50,000 from your current workplace retirement plan. This is a pretty powerful ability if you've been contributing money for \"non-retirement\" purposes into your 401(k) in order to take advantage of your plan's tax advantages.",

If i would have put that money into my tax deferred accounts, I would have been much, much better off today.\n\nOf course, the internet was just starting out and access to all the financial advice was not available.  I actually had to read books and magazines to gain insight.\n\n we had 401ks, IRAs, mutual funds, stocks, a municipal bond paying 9% interest, etc.  So, I did a lot of learning by the School of Hard Knocks.\n\nMy advice, do not do it. max the 401k first.\n\nI regret not putting that money into an account that grew tax free, meaning, I was getting a 22% rate of return each year or whatever my bracket was back then.",

            "comment": "I've heard of a general rule of thumb to put 15% - 20% of your income towards retirement and that should gain enough in order to sustain you through retirement with the 4% rule. Obviously, this works best if you started this in your early 20's.\n\nAs long as you're still putting 20% towards your 401k/IRA retirement accounts, I can see an upside to investing post-tax money in a brokerage account. You just have to realize you're taking on risk paying taxes on dividends and of possibly not having enough during retirement.\n\nI was actually doing this, but slowly increased my retirement savings to finally get to maxing them out.",

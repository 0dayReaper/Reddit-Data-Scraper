Most payroll systems are able to stop before you go over limit, provided that you did not or do not have another job in the same year.\n\nJust so you know, the limit is $66,000 in 2023 for employee + employer contributions combined.\n\nThe $22,500 limit is only for employee contributions to traditional pretax and Designated Roth. Employer contributions and after-tax not-Roth contributions don't count against this limit.",

            "comment": "&gt;If your personal contributions and company match contributions together are more than the limit\n\nJust to clarify a potential misunderstanding: the $22,500 IRS limit only applies to **your** contributions.  Employer match is outside of that, falling under a separate (and much higher) annual limit.\n\nIn general, your employer's payroll and/or 401k provider will be tracking your contributions during the year.  If you hit the limit set by the IRS, those paycheck deductions are supposed to stop.  Or be rejected by the 401k.\n\nIf you participate in multiple 401k plans during a given year, things can get more complicated.  That $22,500 is for you as an individual, regardless of how many plans you contribute into.  But each plan only knows what you've put in with them.\n\nThere can be situations that lead to overcontribution: you being in multiple plans, retroactive \"highly compensated employee\" restrictions, incorrectly allowing a \"catchup\" limit increase (for people older than 50), payroll glitch, or some other error.  But there are processes to remove any amount above your allowed limit.  When done properly, the extra money is simply removed from the 401k and returned to you, though it then gets treated just like regular income so there will be extra tax involved but no penalty.  That extra tax is just what you'd owe/pay if the 401k contribution hadn't happened in the first place.",

It may not specifically state that the trustee can take out an equity loan on the house to pay for property tax and maintenance, but it may say something like \"shall have the power to sell, alienate, convey, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of....\" or \"power to borrow money, to pledge or mortgage trust assets...\" or something of that nature.\n\nHas anyone just *asked* the aunt why the five-year wait to sell the house, or how the taxes &amp; maintenance are to be paid during that five years? Does her trust give someone the right to live in the house for 5 years after her death? Perhaps her estate has sufficient assets other than the house that the trust could simply cover those amounts out of other assets.",

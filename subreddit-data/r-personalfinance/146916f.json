On a conservative estimate of 4 weeks per month you make $3600 net per month. Your listed expenses are just about $2900, so your leftover is at most $700 per month. It's not a huge buffer, and there's probably expenses you're not tracking or listing here.\n\nThe good news is you may get up to 52 paychecks per year, so that's a $3600 addition that can go towards savings or other surprise expenses. \n\nWhat are you saving towards retirement, emergency funds, and other investments?",

If you're \"living on the edge\" you need to spend a few weeks tracking EVERY expense, because you're probably being nickel and dimed by small purchases or some other monthly expenses you left off, like phone/internet/cable",

We spend close to $300 a week just going out because neither of us enjoy cooking much.",

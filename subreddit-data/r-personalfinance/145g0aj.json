    "postText": "Hi, I got accepted into a graduate progam with full tuition coverage and an 18K stipend with the understanding that I will be working 20 hrs/week as a TA. I am leaving my jobs that make me about 65k/yr. I have 80k in retirement and 25k in savings. I expect to spend about 17-18k on living costs (rent, car, food) per year. How much should I save while I am in grad school? a.k.a. how much should I be making with a second job? I try to contibute at least 6k a year for retirement in a roth and I would also like to have some savings built up for a house/family by the time I get done (4-5 yrs). \n\nAlso, I have about 15K of my savings in mutual funds and the rest in a high yield savings account. I dont really know much about investing and I feel like I dont make enough to get a financial advisor. Any advice in that department would be appreciated as well. ",

I mean, as much as you can, within your budget -- which will obviously be different, given your situation. Your #1 goal is obviously focusing on your grad program.\n\n&gt; Also, I have about 15K of my savings in mutual funds and the rest in a high yield savings account. I dont really know much about investing and I feel like I dont make enough to get a financial advisor.\n\nYou're probably right. These are safe and liquid. Given that you may need access to the funds in the short term - and rates are reasonably decent - that's not terrible.\n\nIf you can, continue to max your IRA contribs",

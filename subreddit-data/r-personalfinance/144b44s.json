    "postText": "My mom is receiving a 1 million dollar settlement from a lawsuit. She doesn\u2019t have a specific career, own a home, or a car. She works under the table cleaning Air Bnb\u2019s. My parents don\u2019t have equity in our family and have always struggled financially and had precarious jobs. She doesn\u2019t have other savings and just went through a separation from my dad. She is open to suggestions about how to best invest and utilize this money but her and I both don\u2019t have the best knowledge related to finances. Some will be set aside for a home purchase (I will likely be able to obtain a mortgage for us, as I have a reliable career as a RN and we plan to live together) as well as some to ensure she has a reliable car. \n\n\nI wanted to ask the people of reddit, \nIf you were in her situation, how would you use the rest of the funds to continue to make money (maybe a career, or an investment like a GIC?) \nWould you invest in a subway franchise? \n\nAny suggestions are appreciated, no matter if they\u2019re based on your own loose fantasies and day dreams \ud83d\ude0a wwyd?",

She needs to start paying her taxes. If she wants to continue with the job she has, then this means filing taxes as self employed person.\n\n2. Open a taxable account with Fidelity.\n\n3. Deposit the million dollars into Fideliy\n\n4. Automatically invest $20,000 per week into FXAIX\n\n5. Roth IRA for her airbnb job\n\n6. She should tell no one about her windfall",

            "comment": "Honestly, with that sort of money and such little experience investing and etc,  the first thing you probably want to spend the money on is a consultation with a certified fiduciary financial advisor. \n\nThat's potentially enough money to retire on if it's used correctly, but also a small enough amount that your mom could burn through it in a few years and end up back at square one. So hold off an any major purchases until you have a clear plan.\n\nIf your mom doesn't want to work anymore (not sure how old she is?) and could live on a modest income, she should be focused on very boring investments like bonds. The advice to invest in ETFs assumes she has another 20 years until retirement. ETFs are great as a long term investment, but they don't always make money in the short term. Whereas right now she could literally put that million dollars in a 5% CD and make a guaranteed $50,000/year (minus taxes).\n\nSide note: if you put the money in a CD or high yield savings account (which should be step 1) make sure to put it in a few different banks because each bank will only insure up to $250,000. \n\nIf your mom still plans to keep working, then she has a lot more options. Then she has to figure out what she wants to do, which isn't just a financial question. But talk to that financial advisor to make sure any plan she has makes sense. \n\nCongrats, and best of luck!",

Best thing she can do is open a brokerage account, put the money in a safe ETF (like VOO which tracks the S&amp;P 500, or QQQ which follows the Nasdaq) and leave it there and don't look at it, don't touch it. Keep living your lives the way you are and soon enough that 1 million turns into generational wealth for her and your family.",

Let the money sit there and invest it in something that climbs at a safe boring pace. \n\nI\u2019d just keep enough money in an bank account as a EMERGENCY fund and if she buys a car with this settlement just buy the most basic model of a Honda civic or Toyota Corolla. There\u2019s no needs for $50,000 trim models. \n\nAlso if she\u2019s working under the table then I\u2019m sure she has no 401k accounts so this money is essentially her retirement. I don\u2019t know how old she is but if you don\u2019t want her in her late 70s still cleaning BnBs for cash you\u2019ll help her not blow this money.",

It sounds like mom probably needs to live off some of that money now, so I wouldn't be putting all of it in ETFs.",

    "postText": "I'm trying to reduce my auto insurance, and I was hoping someone here may be able to help. I'm not sure what the minimum required is in FL for these, but here are my options. These are my wife and I's vehicles and insurance options chosen.\n\n'21 Hyundai Sonata - Lease\n\n'18 F150 - Finance\n\nBodily Injury &amp; Property Damage Liability: 10k ea. person/ 20k ea. accident/ $25k ea. accident\n\nUninsured Motorist: 10k ea. person/ 20k ea. accident - Stacked (no clue what stacked means but progressive said it's required in FL)\n\nPersonal Injury Protection: Basic/10k/Named Insured &amp; Resident Relatives/1k deductible\n\nMedical Payment: 1k each person\n\nSonata &amp; F150 Options:\n\n2k comprehensive deductible\n\n2k collision deductible\n\nDenied loan/lease payoff and roadside assistance\n\nBoth of us are 25 and have had no accidents nor tickets. We pay $311/mo with these options still.\n\nSome advice is appreciated on if we are choosing too high of options and can scale them back down. If I can scale down the bodily injury or anything to reduce, that'd be great. We're very safe drivers and I don't anticipate us being at fault in any accidents. \n\nEdit: thanks for talking some sense into me everyone. I should make sure we\u2019re covered in case of accident instead of trying to save pennies here.",

You should be increasing them, not trying to lower them. \n\nYour $20,000 property damage limit won\u2019t cover damages if you hit even a cheap car, and $10k barley covers medical bills. You could be sued for the excess.\n\nNobody anticipates being at fault in an accident, but stuff happens.",

            "comment": "If you pay six months up front instead of monthly then your payments will be a little lower.\n\nThe policy is for six months. You pay a \"financing fee\" in order to do monthly payments.\n\nThe unearned portion of your premium is refundable, so it's not like you're \"locked in\" for the whole policy period.\n\nHaving a better credit score could help (in many states, idk about Florida specifically)\n\nGet a quote from GEICO, see if they can do better.\n\nCall an independent agent and have him shop around for you. They get paid from commissions on the premium, so no cost to you.\n\nCheck your policy documents closely to see how you were classified. They may be over estimating your annual miles driven. If they're wrong, call them and ask them to fix it.\n\n&gt;advice is appreciated on if we are choosing too high of options and can scale them back down\n\nLike everybody else said, your liability limits are extremely low.\n\nThere should be a breakdown of how much you pay for each coverage.",

    "postText": "I had a job and participated in a 403b plan with Mutual of America. When it was set up I basically had the representative on site set everything up for me and didn't pay any attention to it and let it accrue money and matching from my employer. I left that position in 2021 but my new job didn't have any retirement benefits so I let it sit for another 2 years. Now I started another new job that has a 401k with matching. I want to roll it over but I cannot get anything completed.\n\nI have been calling Customer Service every few days for 2 months. The wait times are usually 2 hours then they want to verify my identity which for some reason involves me confirming my identity through an email link rather than my social/address/DOB. The account was set up with my first jobs email. That email does not exist anymore and hasn't existed for 2 years now. I tell them this and they say that until I gain access to that email I cannot make any changes to my account and usually hang up right after.\n\nOne time I was able to get my ticket elevated but the result was that they would have a higher level representative scheduled to call me back so that I could get my information changed, but that was 3 weeks ago.\n\nHas anyone who has dealt with Mutual of America know what I can do? What steps can I take to finally get this done? I've contacted my old employer to see if they had any ideas, but they currently don't have an HR manager so no one really know how to help.",

They're notorious for this kind of behavior and it's beyond frustrating (just look at their Google reviews). Unfortunately, with most rollovers, the firm that it's moving to cannot request the rollover on their end- transfers are different from rollovers.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to call right when they open, plan to wait on hold for 1-2 hours, but then when you get a rep on the line, write down their name, time they answered, etc. and request your rollover. When they try to make you jump through hoops, ask to speak with a manager. If you are denied or the manager also tries to make you jump through hoops (expect that they will), get their name and time of the call and let them know you'll be reporting them to the Attorney General's office. Once your rollover is finally requested, expect a month+ for processing times and receiving the rollover check in the mail.\n\nBe polite, but firm. Good luck!",

Initiate a \"pull\" of the funds from the new account (rather than a \"push\" from the old account, which is what it looks like you are trying to do).\n\nThere is no benefit to Mutual of America to help you (since you want to take away funds under management). There is significant benefit to whoever the new 401k provider to help you pull funds over for them to manage. :)",

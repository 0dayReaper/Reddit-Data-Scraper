            "comment": "Ok, I got sober at 28 years old, here's what I did. I got the shoe box that held all the unopened bills I had been ignoring for over a year and took it to a free credit counselor. He contacted all of my creditors and made arrangements to pay them. All I had to do was pay the credit agency every week. This simplified things greatly for me allowing me to concentrate on sobriety. I had a full time job but really needed additional money since I was stretching just to meet my new budget. I took my tax refund and bought two lawnmowers, and posted handmade signs for lawn work. Luckily I already had a pickup truck and free time in the absence of \"bar time\", so things worked out. I ran the lawn service for two years and even had to hire help. The biggest thing was changing direction in my life as far as drinking goes, it allowed me to take a new direction in all aspects of living.",

I'm going through some financial catastrophes right now (many of which are admittedly of my own making), and keep running into the phrase \"credit counseling.\" I'm sorry to bother you, but google hasn't quite explained what that is. How is it different from debt consolidation? If you wouldn't mind telling me more I;d be very grateful. Thanks. (And congrats on your sobriety and drive.)",

There was a service in my city that offered free or very inexpensive counseling. Basically I made an appointment and dumped my financial life on the guy's desk. He contacted my creditors who were hounding me for past due payments. He made arrangements with each creditor and all payments went through his service. I simply showed up at his office each week with my paycheck, signed it over then he would hand me a check which I would live on through the week. \n  This is the plan that was devised for me and it worked but everyone has different situations with different solutions. I have helped newly sober guys with their fiances and have seen cases where they settled credit card debt for much less than they owed. I think debt consolidation involves taking a loan to pay off many creditors at once then just paying on the single loan. A good credit counselor should be able to develop the best overall strategy. Try http://www.consumercredit.com/ , I think it's nationwide and non-profit.",

I tried all the budgeting software and eventually just used a spreadsheet that meets my needs (tracking bills vs current money). I know that's what YNAB is supposed to do, but the \"move money around\" part of the website is not intuitive - at least to me - and messed up everything I had set up. \n\nOP, I suggest getting a spreadsheet and making 3 columns. First is the bill, 2nd is the amount, 3rd is your starting balance in 1 cell, 2nd cell is total of all the bill amounts, 3rd is the 1st minus the 2nd. That's worked really well for me. You can copy the tab and start over each month with your current money you have allocated for expenses. I find that tracking expenses and savings separately works well for me, but everyone's brain works differently, so invest some time to figure out what is best for you.\n\nAside from that, I agree 100% with the advice to read the prime directive and to review the flow chart. \n\nCongratulations on 90 days! I'm on like day 6 or 7 with no booze. So booooorred! :)",

I mean, it can't do the restaurant tipping thing, but it does accurately count gas transactions, as well as offering you your current balance with and without pending transactions. I actually switched to using this card as my everyday spending card for this reason unless there is a significant rewards difference for a specific purchase. It also lets me \"pay ahead\" if I want (you can pay the balance to below zero), so sometimes I'll pay off the entire balance including the pending transactions if that works better for whatever day I decide to reconcile my accounts.",

I work in banking and am a little confused as to how BofA accurately shows your has purchase in the pending transactions when your other cards don't. Pending transactions rely entirely on what the merchant sends to the card. i.e if you get $100 of gas and the gas station places a $1 hold on your card to make sure it is valid, the pending transaction will show as $1 until the merchant batches their transactions and sends the updated amount. This also depends slightly on how quickly your bank processes new information. Many do nightly processing, but bigger banks can afford more frequent processing times. How quickly does BofA show the correct amount?\n\nRegardless, I definitely recommend using your CC over a debit card for purchases you would make anyway as it is a good way to keep your money safe.",

The replacement card took almost two weeks to get, when every other bank took about 3-5 days (later learned you need to specifically request for an \"expedited\" card from Simple if you want it faster), and the customer service rep responded to my frustration with not being able to access my account because of double authentication (didn't have my phone on me, and was trying to pause my lost card on my laptop) by telling me they would help me go through the process of closing my account, which was just like, ????\n\nSaying that, all the other customer service times prior to that were great experiences.

We're unlikely to have more than 1-2k in savings at any one time until we get more established after we graduate, so interest won't really account for much during those 4-6 years. Simple works well then as a sort of \"baby steps\" account, in that the UI is supppeeerrr nice, and very millennial friendly. Whenever I do suggest a simple account though, I do always tell people about Ally being virtually the same thing, but with a better interest rate. ",

My dad made a lot of money when I was younger ($20k+ a month), but yet we were bankrupt multiple times, and had to squeeze into a small rented room with a distant relative's apartment because we couldn't even afford our own place, and owed people money. All these because my dad was a compulsive gambler. It was only after my mum put her foot down and made my dad hand over his paycheck every month that we were finally able to afford our own place when I was 12. Was it embarrassing for him? Probably. But it was surely useful when he had cancer a few years later.  But, congratulations on the sobriety and getting back on your feet. :)",

Actually,  addicts/alcoholics usually swing either towards one end of the spectrum or the other in terms of habits/addiction. All or nothing.  Manifestation of the disease of addiction with food can either be compulsive overeating or anorexia.  It is the same disease, different manifestation.  With money it can either be financial anorexia or extreme frugality vs overspending. There is sexual anorexia as well as sexual compulsivity/ addiction.  It really depends on the person. The key to recovery is finding a balance, in everything, one day at a time. Not all addicts are huge spenders.  Some are. Some are extremely frugal like me, working towards balance.  I know that there is a great 12 step group for financial issues called debtors anonymous, or DA. ",

Always leave yourself a fudge factor for incidentals.\n\nYou\u2019ll be left with your actual disposable income. Take this and cut it in half, take that money and put it in savings. Leave the other half in checking. If you have a car, postpone a payment. Take that money and do the same thing. Now you have a buffer.\n\nPay minimum payments on credit cards except one. Pay as much as you feel comfortable paying extra on the lowest balance until it\u2019s paid off. DONT USE IT! Take that payment and add it to the other card or bill, until that\u2019s paid, then take from both and pay off the next one. It starts going fast the farther you get. Save the biggest nut for last. \n\nTo be honest, it\u2019s going to be tough to save fast with $100/month, but if you can save just $100 each and every month, that\u2019s $1200 for the year. If you get a tax return, put half in savings other in checking. Don\u2019t slap it all on one thing unless you have a bit of a buffer saved. The key is the buffer. The bigger the buffer cash you have the easier it will be and the less you will have to worry if you have to replace a tire or an emergency comes up. \n\nDiscipline. I can tell you, that just by skipping lunch for three months I saved over $300! It can be done. Grocery, shop at discount grocery and use coupons. Drive less, eat less and curb spending on \u201cstuff.\u201d\n\nIt will be slow and sometimes feel like it\u2019s never going to happen, but after a few months and your twice what you had before, it will become apparent. Do some projections and make goals. Go out by 6 months and see if you can beat your target!\n\nIt worked for me and still works. Good luck!",

Have a 6 month, 1 year, and 5 year plan in your head. It's not so much something you have to be 100% steadfast on (especially a 5 year) but it gives you that reason to push impulses aside and have a goal to work at.\n\nSomething like \"hey i'd like to go to school and get a degree!\"\n\n1. Get a job with consistent income (part-time, whatever, maybe start at a restaurant)\n\n2. Save until you have enough to start on your own (6 mo - 2 yr)\n\n3. Research financial aid/student loans for your income bracket\n\n4. Start classes at a JC (2 yr - 3 yr)\n\n5. Transfer to a university (2 yr)\n\n6. obtain bachelor's\n\n7. get job, better pay\n\nNot that you have to do this specifically but it is an easier example. You're always working at something down the road.",

One thing that has always worked for me to save smaller amounts of money is that I value change and small demomination bills and will utilize them to collect a small savings.\nFirst of all, every penny counts. I've noticed nowadays at convenience stores etc, that the cashiers have a habit of asking me if I want my penny on a purchase that comes to \"something.99\"? Yes, I want it! It's my penny. I earned it and they add up.\nI keep every bit of change seperated in containers and save them to use for small things like sodas and snacks, so I dont have to use a debit card and risk a $3 fee on a $2 purchase. The goal there, is to not WASTE any money at all.\nDepending on my current situatiin, I will then pick either 1's, 5's, or 10's and not spend them. They will either get deposited into savings, or just set aside in am envelope. If I'm saving 5's that month, then whenever I have 5's in my wallet at the end of the day, they get seperated and go unused until needed for a certain goal. Even 1's add up really quick, and it's nice to have an extra couple hundred saved up at the end of the month by just being prejudiced against those 5's and setting them aside.\nYes, I know this isn't the biggest, most brilliant course of accumulatiing savings, but it has worked nicely for me in the past.\nCongratulations on the sobriety-that's amazing of you. Stick to that above all else, and you'll be suprised how quickly and wonderfully the rest of life (including money), will fa) into place. Best of luck to you, OP.",

You'll end up crazy if you don't allow for some discretionary spending. Be it $10 or $100 whatever is reasonable. Not that it means spending you don't account for but everyone needs something they look forward to. Whatever that is for you. A dinner out. A cup of coffee. etc. Don't feel like every free dollar HAS to go toward every goal. Make goals but make them reasonable and maintain your sanity. \n\nWhen you get on your feet a little more maybe try to give back something your sister wasn't expecting to get. It will make you feel good and give you a goal to work toward. \n\nGood luck and congrats on the sobriety. ",

They're money sinks that many people assume are required for day to day life. There is no shame in renting, there is no shame in buying a used car.

You can check pending deposits and cancel them if you're tight on cash that day. You can withdrawal your money at anytime but you won't see it for 5 days because they have to sell off some stock in your portfolio to provide you the cash.

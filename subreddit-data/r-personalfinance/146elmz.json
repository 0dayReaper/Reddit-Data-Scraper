    "postText": "Just found out parents, 77 and 74, have $160k in credit card debt spread over at least 10 credit cards with an average interest rate of 20%.  They have pensions and social security that bring in a little more than 10k a month after taxes.  This is in Oregon.\n\nThey are not telling us much about their specific finances, but I know they pay about 3K for a mortgage including taxes and insurance (bought at $450k 4 years ago with Zillow valuation of $690k and 375k left of the principal). \n\nI was visiting and noticed that they were aggressively penny pinching and upon inquiry they let me know about the debt.  Apparently they are living paycheck to paycheck with all money going to minimum payments.\n\nI offered to give them a low interest loan of $160k.  I would need to charge a level of interest that doesn\u2019t trigger a taxable event with respect to annual gifting.  My friends have advised looking into bankruptcy.  My dad says they can\u2019t refi, because their credit scores are 550-600.\n\nWe really want to take a look at the accounts and see if they are indeed doing everything they can, but my mom is refusing to let us see any details.  They have hid this debt for a couple of years, apparently they only had 10k of debt 4 years ago.\n\nWhat would you all do?",

Given their ages, they shouldn't have any big purchases in their future.  Maybe a vehicle, but if they aren't paying on the cards, they could save for a car..............or you could loan them the money for a car if/when the time comes.",

What if they're not answering questions because they have not 'been managing' and you may find an even bigger mess by taking a closer look. \n\nI would not offer them a loan, maybe there's other ways you can help without risking more money.

    "postText": "Im tired of the rat race and the constant work, pay bill , work, pay bill  cycle. I make decent income (15k take home)  and from that goes 6k for mortgage, 4k for living expenses, 1k for kids activities, 1k for car,  1k misc (amazon, utilities, etc) and Im left with only 2k for travel, HYSA, add to emergency funds, and everything else. Granted the 15k month is after maxing 401k and IRA for both myself and the wife but its money I wont see for a long time. Wife works but she makes less than 20/hour and i dont count what she makes in my budget. If i had at least 4k month of disposable income instead of 2k it would feel lot less restricting..",

If you\u2019re taking home $15K after deductions for retirement, and have $9K after paying your mortgage, then you are not \u201chouse poor\u201d \u2014 you have a spending problem. This sub might be able to give you some suggestions if you want to give more detailed information about your monthly expenses. The categories you\u2019ve listed are pretty vague. It\u2019s also unclear if what your wife makes is in addition to the $15K or is included in the $15K.",

That is, you are eating up your high income with overconsumption.  \n\nIt is normal to feel like you are \u201ccaught in the rat race\u201d when you are working hard just to maintain a lifestyle. As others have stated, the key to escaping the sense that you are a slave to money is to take control of your spending. Trying to out earn your spending to get ahead is like trying to out exercise bad eating habits. \n\nWhen you get your spending under control and start to live below your means, you will feel more secure and less stressed financially knowing that you can legitimately weather making less money if need be ( because you have wiggle room to bring in less every month and still cover expenses, and you\u2019ll have savings to ride out tough times). And working less, or taking a different job that pays less but you find more rewarding and/or less stressful, can become a real option. (Think of a dentist that works 4 days a week and takes off 6 weeks a year). \n\nI strongly suggest checking out \u201c The Millionaire Next Door\u201d by Stanley/Danko. Here is a good 10 minute summary video of the concepts on YouTube: https://youtu.be/Wb1YAJv_LCM\n\nThe simple equation for a high earner to build wealth (wealth being all assets minus all liabilities) is to couple your high income with frugality and a high savings/investment rate. \n\nI\u2019ve always found the concepts of opportunity costs and diminishing utility to help me with decisions on spending and savings. That is, spending twice as much on a house or car rarely ever gives you twice the happiness/satisfaction/fulfillment ( what economists call \u201cutility\u201d). And the true cost of anything is not the dollar amount; it is instead the cost of all the alternatives you are giving up. A $70K car is nicer for sure than a $35K car, but is it twice as nice, especially when you can buy the same car used in 4 or 5 years for $35k? And is the nicer car worth the cost of alternatively using that saved monthly money to spend more time with the family on a very nice vacation every year, or on any other number of things you can think of? \n\nYou are half way there. You have the income. But it will probably take a \u201ccoming to financial Jesus\u201d moment for you and your wife to come up with a plan and to begin to act. But as you start to make changes, the positive impact on your finances and mental health should help you stay the course and resist the temptation to overspend.",

Even the take home (net) from that will get you very close to the $4k monthly disposable income you fell you need.\n\n$180k annual take home (after retirement investing and savings) is no small amount unless one is living a lifestyle above their means. Although it is quite a bit, don't blame it all on mortgage. IMO you need to take a look at you entire budget and lifestyle before you give up.",

I don\u2019t have leverage in my life but statistically that\u2019s not anything out of the ordinary. Based on your other spending descriptions, yes you can shave off couple of hundred here and there but the reality is that raising a family is really expensive. There are always random costs and of course you have more mouths to feed. Add in the recent surge in inflation and grocery bills are higher and so are generic activities (I pay 100 per cello lesson every week for my son and 3 years ago it was 50). So it is what it is. You have two options. 1) put your kids up for adoption (not a real option) 2) shut up and be happy you are still maxing out your retirement accounts and make up for it on future earnings after your kids leave the house. Also, if you don\u2019t like high cost of living in Washington, go somewhere else. It is like people in Manhattan who make 500k / year and are effectively middle class complaining. Nobody is forcing you or them to be anywhere. That should be part of your cost benefit analysis of where to work.",

And yes there is always some way to tighten the belt here and there but the main point is that you are maxing your retirement contributions already as well so not as if all is lost anyway (though I have always been more of an extreme saver myself). I just went through my budget with my wife after I saw this post and we don\u2019t eat out at all, but buy organic type foods and that\u2019s 2K per month and there is no getting around it. But what can be more important than our health, what is the point of not that? Just an example",

Lots of people I\u2019m around in my industry started with millions of dollars from their parents so I have noticed that I often times feel poor because of the relative comparison to those people (since I am around them often). I started with zero but am ultra high income, better than most of them in fact, but again it just doesn\u2019t feel that way despite my success so maybe there is some of that here as well given I\u2019m guessing your industry has lots of $ going around (and definitely your city). I just try to tune it out.",

Money in defense is good but not that good. Nothing like big tech or big law or M7 MBA , but its probably the easiest field to make  a steady 200k with good work life balance. I dont have any wealthy friends around me either, none of my friends have inheritance in the millions , not even in the 100-200k range  lol. Are you in law or medicine?",

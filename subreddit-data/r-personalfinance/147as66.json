    "postText": "Hi Reddit,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoping to get opinions on whether or not my wife and I should purchase a new vehicle.\n\nHere are the numbers, keep in mind we are debt free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAge: 26 and 25\n\nIncome: 210k / year\n\nSavings/Year: 95k\n\nNet Worth: 200k (ish)\n\nInvestments: 65k - S&amp;P 500\n\nCash: 70k - Should be invested, I know - we planned on buying a house earlier this year until we realized how interest rates and mortgages work.\n\n401K:  23k\n\nVehicle: 55k (paid off)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife has not driven in years, and she'd like to drive again so she can be more independent. Her vision since high school has been to purchase her own car and be proud of it, which I agree with. I was lucky enough to make a big salary out of school and was able to purchase my dream truck last year, which has been amazing to drive and a great accomplishment in my mind.  Her vehicle will be  my commuter 3 days a week and her car to use whenever she wants - she works remotely and I go into office 3x a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe initially set a budget of 25k to put towards a used vehicle. After looking at the options it was a bit depressing, as entitled as that sounds. We decided to up the budget to 30k and look at new vehicles, and realized we could get into a new higher end toyota/honda/mazda for around that price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has always wanted to drive a Tesla, and I saw that there is a $7500 tax credit we qualify for on the Model 3 which has a MSRP of $38,400 in our area (Austin).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe're going to pay cash for the vehicle we end up purchasing, are we dumb for extending our budget to 30k? The Tesla option seems like a no-brainer but I want to make sure we're not crazy &amp; letting \"scope creep\" blind us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.",

(BTW, No harm in having a cash cushion) If not, look for a better deal.\n\nIMO a total stock fund like VTI or total world  like VT is preferable to S&amp;P 500 because of greater diversification. S&amp;P 500 still very good, though.\n\nSaving almost 50% is fantastic! Well done avoiding a lot of lifestyle creep.\n\nAre your 401k contributions getting the max employer match? If not, you may have room to increase your contributions.",

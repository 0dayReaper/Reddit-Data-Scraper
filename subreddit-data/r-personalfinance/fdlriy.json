That is because America preaches this \"family\" culture that we are such a strong team all working together. In reality, if they need to close your entire division, they will do it without hesitation. If they can outsource something cheaper, they will do it. You do not owe them anything and if you see a better opportunity for yourself or your family, please take it and make your own financial future.",

A few weeks ago I took a sick day to stay at home and work on my resume and apply to jobs. It worked out great, I just accepted an offer for a much more exciting job with a 50% increase to my current salary. I'll be putting in my two weeks notice on Friday and it has felt great walking in to work everyday this week knowing that they won't be my problem for much longer.",

If you have the opportunity to better your living situation absolutely go for it. However I hope that my employees will be honest with me. If your unhappy please talk to me, if you feel you deserve more pay or if you have a family situation that needs some flexibility in your hours at least let me try to accommodate it before you start looking for something else. And if you need a change let me know sooner than the last moment so I can plan for the transition. \n\nBut what ever you do even if you hated your time there leave on amicable terms. You never know when you might run into that person or deal with that company again. I've had multiple employees come back to us after working somewhere else for a bit you never know where life will take you and I was very glad to have them back.\n\nEdit: of course I comment about talking to your boss about wanting to see some change and this morning one of my lead hands asks for a meeting about concerns with the direction the company is heading.",

Thankfully a robot or worker from a third world country won't take our positions.\n\nWhen I see problems is when someone takes too much advantage of a perk or develops bad habits. Most of the time it doesn't get better over time and its best to prune early.

Manager has 1000s of employees to overlook, the regional CEO has 1000s of managers, and so on and so on. \n\nIf you want just convey this to your manager during your exit interview. This is one of the times/instances where you can be honest. Just make sure to make it clear that while you love him and the team its just how corporate works that makes you leave ie understaffed (if the manager isn't in charge of hiring), lack of benefits and pay, intense workload. Things that aren't related to them. \n\nThis is not only a good way to give your opinion to your employer (corporate, specifically HR actually take whats said in the exit interviews pretty seriously), but also maintains good relations with your immediate supervisor and colleagues which are the bridges you want to maintain.",

Some of these were from selling off less profitable businesses but a lot were from him just firing the bottom 10% of managers. In a 'bloated' company like GE that may have been worthwhile for a time.\n\nThe really bad thing was that other companies started doing it but never got rid of the firing part. So companies like Microsoft would have different teams competing against eachother in cutthroat competition just to not be in that bottom percentile that gets fired/cut. So it got out of hand.\n\nAlso Welch didn't believe in climate change and a lot of people claimed the financial services companies owned by GE buoyed its wealth, especially when Welch's successor sold off massive GE assets after Welch retired.",

I almost always do what\u2019s best for them even at cost to me and we really are a sort of family. \n\nHaving said that if they stopped doing a good job I would let them go and they know it. \n\nA bad day. A bad week sure. But the reality is I work my ass off and currently make less than they do even. \n\nWe are a different type of family that you can get kicked the fuck out of if you don\u2019t live up to your end of the bargain.\n\nEdit: continuation. \n\nAnd I think it\u2019s fair. I learned from my dad who\u2019s companies average employee has been there for 20 years. \n\nI ask each employee what their goals are and if they are happy often. I have a food business and my employees will all be managers and co owners of future places if they want. I genuinely see them as people I care about and I want what\u2019s best for them whether it\u2019s with or without my company. \n\nHaving said all that the point of this post is make you realize you don\u2019t owe your employers more than the job you\u2019re doing. You should always leave for better. My job as a boss is to make sure if I want to keep you around I make it worth it. \n\nI treat people well and in return they work hard for me and I have never had a single person quit on me. \n\nJust as important we are all happy to be there.",

CEO and I had that provider.

It is a global company that specializes in different aspects of machinery and parts. I made it on the shortlist and was asked when I would be available for potential hire since I am currently employed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be coming from a coffee/water service industry that is more or less a glorified call center where my daily responsibilities are dealing directly with customers who 60% of the time just need someone to take out personal frustration on, accounts receivable - essentially cold calling apartment complexes and huge companies that have strict payment terms. On top of this I deal with the hassle of managing warehouse inventories/ routes/ drivers that seem to argue while doing the bare minimum - things a supply chain mgr would normally do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company is short staffed and poorly managed since managerial positions are guaranteed for whoever has been at the company longer versus an outside manager who would probably have more experience in creating an efficient environment. After being here a year and a half I noticed that good behavior and work ethic went unnoticed the same way half assed-ness and bad behavior did. Also noticed that the 'sweet old ladies in the office' would talk so much shit about anyone once they left the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat changed my mood towards this corporate company was a time last month where I was written up for *\"performance issues\".* The initial write up happened a month before I was due for a raise (where I ended up receiving .25cents versus .50cents.) When I asked my manager if anyone had else has ever been written up about the same particular mistake that happens weekly, she informed me that *\"just because I never see anyone being pulled to the side, does not mean no one else us held accountable/written up.\"* Highly unlikely because every other coworker of mine is buddy mc fucking buddy with my manager, and so in sync that their diets and thoughts on parenting etc are the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** I am going to be over the moon if I receive this job offer. It will help my resume and experience in the future. The 2 week notice I will give on Friday will correlate and fuck up the week my manager is taking off for vacation in Florida with her family.",

If they have all of those things the need to use guilt to keep people simply doesn\u2019t exist.  Small businesses are sometimes the worst offenders in my industry because most tattoo shops (my industry) are small businesses. The ones that are chains have been much better but they all use the private contractor loophole to deny artists any benefits.",

One of them even grabbed me for a few hours to go to his house and trouble shoot a network issue he was having. They treated every employee fairly, although pay wasn't amazing, it wasn't bad. I went on trips with the owners to different facilities and was actually treated the best I've ever been treated in a job. Now that we are under new ownership it's 100% different, unfortunately previous owners had no say since they brought in an investment firm in hopes to make this company the best in the world and didn't have majority, but I watched as they were visibly upset people lost jobs. I still see them from time to time when they roam the office and you bet your ass they stop and ask how I'm doing, and make sure everything is good and we are happy.\n\nRemember the grass isn't always greener on the other side remember that, I've seen a friends leave jobs that treat them well  to take a job that is a bump of pay only to lose it months later then have to find another job and get paid back what they were at or less and they had to start back at square one.\n\nThat being said the company I was with was family owned and started where I live, the others were not. Just remember more pay does not mean better job. I'm happy with my job because of my coworkers and my boss who I have a rapport with. It would be hard to leave them because I know I'd have to start fresh and the people around me may not be ideal to work with and management could be poor. You say make your own financial future but remember it's not always about money,  your emotional status should always be priority. I'd rather make $60,000 a year and be happy every day then $100,000 a year and be absolutely dreading going into work every day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit /u/ [dubstylers](https://www.reddit.com/user/dubstylers/)  said something about mom and pop shops which is what this sounds like but it was in the top 10 companies in the world for it's business and was a much larger scale than mom and pop shops.",

When I finished the appointment (it lasted a little over an hour, including travel time) I headed back to work right after. Later in the day, when my lunch time rolled around, I began the clocking out process, when my supervisor stopped me. The conversation:\n\nSupervisor: \"Hey, why are you clocking out?\"\n\nMe: \"Lunch.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"You already took your lunch when you went to the doctor.\"\n\nMe: \"Nope.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"What do you mean, nope?\"\n\nMe: \"I took personal time to go to the doctor. I didn't say I was skipping lunch to go to the doctor.\"\n\nSupervisor: \"Um, that's not how it works.\"\n\nMe: \"See you after lunch!\"\n\nSorry, my life doesn't revolve around my minimum wage job. Did I get fired? Nope.\n\nWhile I don't believe in allowing a company to dictate what I do and don't do when I need to leave the job (within reason), I also am very conscientious about the work I do. They know it, I know it. I work hard and expect leeway when I take time off to do things I need to do. The reality is, if everyone did the same, bosses wouldn't get to be so shitty with low wage employees.\n\nI know, too many people are desperate and worried about losing their job, so they'll do anything or put up with anything.

I was proud, I felt like I could help management and associates become closer seeing as I started as an associate and moved my way up. Not until I was included on the management decisions did I realize how little they care about the everyday associates. If they could\u2019ve outsourced jobs to monkeys, they would\u2019ve done it without second thought. At that point, I knew it was time to take that leap of faith and try something I always wanted to do.

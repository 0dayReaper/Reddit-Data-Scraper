    "postText": "I am 21 and have about 15.5 thousand dollars in debt right now. 15 is from a car repossession I signed for a ex(I am aware stupid choice but at the time was in love and making good money) and 500 in miscellaneous charges. The 500 is in collections but do not know when the car was repossessed but by best guess is almost a year ago from what I could figure out from my ex( I changed my number after the breakup which is my guess as to why they didnt try to contact me).  I had a massive depression and was working minimum wage jobs just covering bills these last few months. I recently completed a course and have a job offer where I will be making 2400-2600 a month(with benefits). I am also in school in 2 years will be make ~40k annually then 80k 2 years after that. I currently have no bills as my father let me move back with him to finish school and pay off what debt I could(he does not know how much as I find this extremely embarrassing) for which I am extremely grateful. What is my best option here buckle down and pay off the debt, bankruptcy, or try to negotiate with collections? Any advice is appreciated and hope everyone has a great night day morning or whatever it is when you read this",

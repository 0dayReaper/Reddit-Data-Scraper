    "postText": "Hi to whoever decides to read this (sorry for it being long but thought more context helps) and thank you to those who respond with good intentions. \n\nI\u2019m going to be 25 soon and currently work and live in SF. My situation in regards to living and finances is I live alone paying $1,900 in rent, add in utilities/groceries/misc. with $400, and then the occasional outing. \n\nI work in sales so this is where it gets a little bit hard planning for myself. My net monthly income (post tax) can be anywhere from 3.2k (this is if I were to not sell anything)  to 4.5k (decent month) upwards to 6k (a good month/ongoing quarter by my standards). I\u2019ve seen higher highs but not often enough that I want it to be part of this discussion. \n\nStill a paycheck to paycheck type of situation sometimes but I\u2019ve seen way worse days lol. On top of that, have 20k looming from student loans (knocked off 5k in the past 2 years) and was really hoping for the 10k or the 20k to be knocked off by the gov (reason why I stopped paying it off but not looking good). Still hopeful but I\u2019m basing my life now thinking it\u2019s not going to happen. \n\nWith all this being said, I\u2019ve never been the best about finances from a personal spending point and that\u2019s where the credit card debt comes. I have 10k that I know I can steadily pay off if I\u2019m diligent. But this is where my question comes. \n\nI do have my 401k and personal Roth IRA in good standing and I never want to touch those. However, I have 13k in my ESPP that I can sell and just wipe out the credit card debt to give myself a clean slate. While part of me wants to continue building it up for other purposes down the line I only am thinking of doing it because of those student loan payments coming back and don\u2019t want to stress on two fronts of debt. What are your thoughts? Thank you again.",

How were they during COVID and so they stand to increase? \n\nStudent loan interest rate vs potential stock growth. Loan 6% vs stock projected growth 8%. Hold the stocks. Vice versa, then sell and pay off. It\u2019s a risk but so is every decision. Depends on how want to live.",

What are the minimum payment per month for these?\n\n10k credit debt is pretty significant, what are the interests on these? Better to pay off these if interest rate are high (they typically are). I meant, are you really expect to make 15-20 percent returns on your ESPP, remembers, that is the typically interest rate charged by the credit card company.",

            "comment": "See if your company allows loans against your ESPP and at what rate rather than sell if the company has good prospects.  Is it possible to transfer vested shares to your brokerage account to margin the stock?  Do not cash out your retirement accounts.\n\nTo be honest your financial situation is not that bad if you keep working on it.  Aggressive payments towards the credit card debt anytime you have a good sales month ADD to payment.  If you are paying minimum get aggressive NOW.  Stop going out.  Stop using your credit cards until zero balance.  Take your lunch to work. Stop paying student loans until pause is over (looks like August 29 2023) and wait for Supremes to rule on debt forgiveness.\n\nIt\u2019s always more fun getting into debt than getting out.  But if you are honest with yourself you make enough money to cut your expenses and likely are not paying your credit cards aggressively.  The student loans can wait until restart happens.",

There are YouTube videos that have extensive information on these two methods. Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

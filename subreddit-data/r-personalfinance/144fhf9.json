    "postText": "My company allows the \"mega backdoor\" as well as  \"backdoor\" conversions. I'm trying to max out all retirement contributions (HSA, pre-tax 401k, IRA -&gt; Roth IRA contributions).\n\nI have the option to contribute roughly $35k of my base salary after-tax to my 401k and then use the mega backdoor conversion to the Roth 401k which I can then manually convert to my Roth IRA.\n\nIs there a reason why I shouldn't do this with money I'm planning to invest long-term anyways?\n\n1. I could put this money into a personal investment account and have access to the contributions AND earnings (taxed).\n2. Or I could contribute them to a Roth 401k, manually convert them to my Roth IRA account.\n\nAs far as I understand, I could still access my contributions tax free AND penalty free with Option 2. (these are after-tax and iirc, only earnings are taxed/penalized under Roth plans, correct?).\n\nWhich means that if I don't see myself needing the earnings of my investments anytime soon, I cannot go wrong with doing the 401k route? And if I don't need the earnings until I'm 59 1/2, I wouldn't ever have to pay taxes on them.",

The principal can be withdrawn penalty free from a Roth but the earnings can't. \n\nIf this is purely for retirement, or if you don't think you'd need more than the principal in an emergency, then yes, this is a good idea.",

You would be converting the money to Roth, so you have to follow the Roth conversion 5-year rule.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/waitingperiodroth.asp",

And within each year, pre-tax conversions are distributed before after-tax conversions.\n\nThere is no 5 year waiting period for after-tax conversions. However if there was any pre-tax money converted the same year, then that is withdrawn before after-tax conversion money. And pre-tax money is subject to the 5-year rule.",

    "postText": "Any advice on paying off ~200K MBA loans while working out of NYC, without being a hermit and saving as much money as possible.\n\nI have a larger network now that I want to stay in touch with, and as I am living in a big city for the first time and it\u2019s my late-20s, I would really like to be able to experience them in the city.\n\nHOWEVER, I can\u2019t help but worry that even paying off more than my expected payment isn\u2019t enough / I should be doing the bare minimum in spending to get rid of the loans.\n\nAny recommendation on balancing this / how others think of managing student loans?\n\n\nFor context - no other loans, ~ 30K in savings, 50K in investments, and 75K in 401K. Will be earning ~150K comp and hoping to earn a bit more through other sources (Upwork, etc.) but I\u2019m not holding my breadth on those being significant.\n\nFYI - currently staying a relatives home ($700 rent) that is in the suburbs. Hoping to move into Manhattan in autumn with max rent $2000 (living with 2-3 other friends).\n\nTHANK YOU!",

Keep contributing to 401k and don't drain your savings.\n\nAlways pay yourself first with 401k, savings, rent, food, transport, etc. What is left over? Put aside a reasonable amount for your social events and now what is left over? Can you pay off those MBA loans in 10 years? \n\nThen just write out your plan and stick to it. A reasonable plan works, where living on rice and beans like a hermit but you pay off the loans in 3.8372983 years is way harder to stick to.",

Kudos to you for such discipline.\n\nI'm assuming your using a high yield savings account.  \n\nI'm assuming your student loan interest is \\~7%?  \n\nIf you're looking to pay down the student loans ASAP, I'd say hustle.  Hustle with your earnings.  Yeah, that sounds awful.  You're out of school, making good money, wanting to live life.  You can still do that.  But hustle with what you got.  You have a MBA, and I'm assuming you have a good head on your shoulders.  Find projects that will maximize that.\n\nFor example, I work in wealth management.  A competent MBA type contractor can help with monthly or quarterly projects.  Project my P&amp;L using these financial models.  $5k project fee.  Research out my enterprise value using these assumptions.  $2k project fee.  Stuff like that.  Yeah, seems transactional and one off, but as a wealth management exec, it's low risk for me.  There's a need for one off analysis that can't easily be outsourced.",

You should still be prioritizing spending less and putting away more; it's about whether to pay off loans first or add to savings / investment first, depending on the interest rate.\n\nWith 150K gross; after considering taxes / deductions / living expenses - you may be able to save 30-50 K depending on choices (continuing to stay with the $700 rent vs taking a rent of $2000 and so on). That means anywhere from 5-10 years to pay off loans if you're devoting ALL surpluses to paying them off; and therefore not being able to buy a home / other life goals etc.\n\nI do get it that you may get pay raises / other opportunities to raise your income faster, which can speed up the process; but don't count on it until it actually happens.",

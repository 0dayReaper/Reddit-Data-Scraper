Will admit the first transfer is pretty slow that way and there is a 4-5 \"lock\" on it. But outward via ACH was super quick and painless compared to other banks. I had an Account with Cap1, CIT UFB and Lending Club. The biggest pia were Cap1 and lending club but I silenced them with wire transfers out. Which at Lending Club you could only do with a phone call....in 2023!",

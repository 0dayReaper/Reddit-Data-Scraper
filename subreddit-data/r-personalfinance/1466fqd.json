    "postText": "So I'm in my early 40s... debt free with mortgage and cars paid off. I work in a factory,make decent money and the wife is a teacher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother lives alone, her house been paid off for decades but shes 70, overweight, and is a bad diabetic. I have to go there after work each day and draw her insulin, shop for her, pay her bills and taxes, mow her property, on and on. Shes becoming more and more bed ridden and its getting harder to deal with her needs since I'm not getting any younger myself and have to drive across town every time she needs something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts really time for a nursing home or figure out how to move her in with me to take care of her more easily. The problem is I don't have the room in my house and the bathroom is upstairs which she isn't capable of climbing at the moment. Also I know she doesn't want to go to a nursing home so that's the last resort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking I need to sell her house and use the money as a down payment on a bigger house that we all could live in and be able to take care of her in, it would be another mortgage that I will have to pay off, but at least we could have her under the same roof to give her better care. I could also rent my current house so that would help pay bills at a new place, along with her social security income... Those 2 things could supplement me and the wife's incomes and the new mortgage/bills.The problem is she keeps telling me she cant sell her house because her friend once told her the state is going to take it from her past medical bills when she had breast and skin cancers removed and the bills I guess were never paid but shes 70 on medicare I believe.... I had to enroll her in extra help to cover her insulin but that's all I know, all her past bills that were acquired when my father was still alive I'm not sure of. The whole medical system dealing with her medicare is hard enough for me to try to understand, everyday it seems she has a stack of new medical literature packets in the mail - I don't know how they expect an elderly person to understand any of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanyway.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember reading somewhere that as long as she didn't die within a 5yr window after selling her house they couldn't come after it as an asset of hers to cover past medical bills. Any ideas,thoughts, or suggestions where to go from here?",

Perhaps she is on Medicaid?\n\nYou may wish to consult an elder care attorney and dig into the specifics of her situation before making any moves.\n\nAnd of course, your mom would need to sell her house, not you. You could help.\n\nPerhaps she could find someone to live with her, and help with her care - in exchange for rent-free living.\n\nWhat does she want?",

            "comment": "The 5 year lookback may be referring to Medicaid (which is different from Medicare).  Medicaid planning is very complex, there are attorneys and advisors who specialize in this.  Medicaid and the lookback vary across states.\n\nBefore thinking about her moving in with your family.  Caring for an aging parent is tough.  As you already know.  And it'll get even tougher.  Having your mother move in, may seem practical at first.  But there's going to be an emotional burden for you and the family.  I'm not saying that either direction is correct or incorrect.  But please be aware that if/when she moves in, home life will be much different.  You won't get a break.  \n\nIf you work in a factory, I'm assuming your job is not WFH.  Same for your wife who is a teacher.  So while having her home may be convenient, her health may come to the point where she will need care during your working hours.  A home health aide could help, but care is care - and it's needed regardless of when your 9-5 is.",

If there aren't liens then I wouldn't worry too much.  It may be your locality doesn't register deeds and liens in the same way, so don't necessarily believe if you've found none.  I'm guessing you and the wife know somebody you suspect of having Janky finances..  you might to some cyberstalking on them just to see what to look for where you are.\n\nAlso look for court cases.  County website here.\n\nThat has me thinking...  I know of somebody who lost his wife in a horrific traffic accident.  The idiot who killed her ended up spending a year in jail...and if I could remember his name I could easily search to see if there are any liens or judgements out there against him.",

Its been a shared responsibility for a few years now and we both feel it would be easier to care for her under our roof rather than constantly driving across town to take her food, draw insulin, clean, deliver her meds, deliver her groceries, get her for dr appnt, etc etc",

    "postText": "I've already looked here and r/StudentLoans for my specific situation, and to no avail.\n\nI have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity coming up soon.  I can participate in the Fresh Start, or not?  I quit paying my student loans in 2000, as well as all my debt.  I never filed bankruptcy, because the student loans would have NOT been discharged, and used alternative methods to dodge collections for several years.  Trashed my credit, but, over time, I have rebuilt it.  Not by paying off any 10+ year old loans, mind you, but because I live where the state says that any debt that the debtor has taken no action on for 5 years can no longer be pursued by the creditor (I guess an exception might be a 15% garnishment of my Social Security payments someday in the future, if I live that long, but I have already made peace with that outcome.), and it's no longer on my credit report, for a similar 7 or 10 year rule.\n\nThe Department of Education has owned my defaulted student loans for decades, and they have gotten a couple of tax refunds, but I generally set my withholdings so that I have to pay a little instead, so other than a $1000 of lost tax returns over the decades, nothing bad has happened.\n\nUntil now...\n\nSo, after I get my Student Loan Fresh Start (which I have been told is automatic?) and December 2023 comes, and if I choose not to pay, will my debt be 23 years old, or 3 months old, for purposes of if it can be reported and for purposes of it it can be collected?\n\nIf the answer is 23 years old, I see no reason to pay.  If it's 3 months old, looks like I'd have to pay to maintain my great credit score?",

It showed up in my email immediately, but not here, so I have already read it and written an UPDATE comment, but briefly, It looks like some Fresh Start benefits are automatic:\n\n&gt;Eligible borrowers automatically receive many of the benefits of Fresh Start without enrollment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Improved Credit Reporting: Starting from December 2022, defaulted loans held by ED are reported as \u201ccurrent\u201d rather than \u201cin collections\u201d to credit reporting agencies. Guaranty agency-held loans also received this benefit starting in February 2023.\n\nSo, I'm still left wondering, if I do nothing, will my Defaulted Students loans begin to be reported as current (they haven't yet...), as stated here, and then 90 days later, be reported as late?  Will the payments be 3 months late, and thus reportable to the credit agencies and will hurt my credit, or will the payments be 23 years late, and thus not reportable at all, per the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, and thus have no impact on my credit?",

In general, negative credit information has to be removed 7 years after the delinquency. If it is a bankruptcy, the length of time in this case is 10 years.\n\nAnd that has been my personal experience ... after 7 years of making no payments, it went off my reports, and I was able to rebuild my credit from scratch, it never popped back on, and still hasn't.  I have read about a case where someone with super old defaulted student loans is having their Social Security garnished to the tune of 15%, and the courts weighed states rights vs fed, and the fed won that one.\n\nIt ***does*** say \"in general\".\n\nThis claim about the Higher Education Act of 1962 would seem to indicate that my situation is NOT \"in general\":\n\n&gt;Under this Act, there is no statute of limitations on federal student loan debt. This means that the time the government has to collect on federal student debt and report on defaulted accounts never runs out.\n\nI love reddit and the people here.  Thanks for spending time on this.  It's such a paradoxical puzzle for me, which I love, but it's also an important real-life one, not just a playful puzzle, so I have to remember to take it seriously and make my best choice soon.",

I'm good with that too.\n\nWhen some litter, and I don't, I shoulder the cost of the street sweeper.  Of course, I'd prefer no one litter, but here we are, me paying taxes for street sweeping.  What to do?\n\nDo you think reminding people what happens to bad debt is effective?  Or even really accurate?\n\nIf you asked me, I pay 29% interest on my Credit Card, instead of 9%, because I and others failed to always pay it back in the past, and Bank of America knows the likely future, and that's why they pay 4% on savings and loan it out at 29% .. some aren't going to pay, it's baked into the business, and in a way all the other Credit Card customers pay ... but they don't if they pay their balances off each month.  So, no, it doesn't really get moved to the shoulders of the rest of us, at least not in an unchosen way.  The larger interest that's caused by my past mistakes and choices is still a choice for others to pay today, or not.  If they want to have credit in this system, part of the interest always goes to cover non-payments.  Or, anyone can choose to not borrow, nothing on their shoulders.  Just how I see it.  I respect your view, I just wasn't persuaded to change my mind on whether to pay a 25 year old debt, because I see it differently.  And, that's OK",

It does say that some things will happen even if I don't enroll, such as:\n\n&gt;Eligible borrowers automatically receive many of the benefits of Fresh Start without enrollment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Improved Credit Reporting: Starting from December 2022, defaulted loans held by ED are reported as \u201ccurrent\u201d rather than \u201cin collections\u201d to credit reporting agencies. Guaranty agency-held loans also received this benefit starting in February 2023.\n\nWhich, in my mind, creates a bit of a paradox.  Looks like my Defaulted Student Loans from 2000 should already be on my Credit Reports as of February 2023, but they are not.\n\nSo, I'm still left wondering, if I take no action, will my Defaulted Student Loans appear on my Credit Report as current?  It says they will above.  And then, will they show as 90 days late in December, if I never restart payments?  Will the \"Improved Credit Reporting\" ***benefit*** actually benefit me?\n\nFor the purposes of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, will my Defaulted Student Loans be 90 days late come December 2023, and thus reportable as late, or will the payments be 23 years and 3 months old, and thus NOT reportable at all?",

So I wrote them a letter explaining why I didn\u2019t owe the IRA tax, along with the page explaining why printed from their website, and then said the other part was from an inheritance which as far as I knew shouldn\u2019t be taxable. Faxed it off and a month or so later I received a new adjustment proposal for half the original amount. Not sure how they came up with that but I figured it was a gift and paid it.",

I got a letter in the irs saying I didn\u2019t file taxes and that I owed taxes on roughly 250k. I called them up and they said to file your taxes. I owed 1000 dollars overall. You can ask to go on a payment plan if you don\u2019t have the lump sum of cash available. If you\u2019re anything like me, I was freaking out. But the losses in that year helped offset any gains. I did get an accountant so that I didn\u2019t mess anything up further.",

Then pay off your debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I did not claim my Robinhood gains and losses on my Turbo Tax for 2021, because it was complicated for me and did not know how.\n\nEither stop using Robinhood because it is too complicated for you, or find out how to properly claim your gains and losses on your taxes. You can hire someone to do it for you.",

    "postText": "Planning to transfer a ROTH IRA containing ~50K of VTI from Fidelity to Merrill.  VTI was specifically chosen so that the transfer is easier i.e. ETF vs mutual fund.  This is so I can take advantage of the Bank of America Preferred Rewards program.  Would this transfer incur any crazy expenses, or is it even possible in the first place? Am I missing anything? Thanks",

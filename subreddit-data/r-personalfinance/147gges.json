    "postText": "Like the title says, I have exactly $6000 in my savings account that I worked up/saved over these few months (I started working in January). I plan to go to a four year university after I graduate and am currently paying no expenses. My sister and I share a car so I\u2019m covered on that end. Is 16 too young to begin investing? Or better, is it wise to begin investing? I really just want to go to college lmao\n\nOne of my goals is to become an MD so I think dropping $2k to get certified as a nursing assistant might be worth it. I could wait until I\u2019m 18 to get certified as a medical assistant however which would be more applicable for the career path I\u2019m interested in. \n\nOr I could buy a spontaneous trip to Vietnam and visit my grandparents. I haven\u2019t been there since I was 2 and it seems magical. \n\nOKAY! Final brain fart: save up and buy a van I can live/travel out of for college (?) / in the future. It\u2019s one of my goals to van life !\n\nIt feels wrong almost that I have all this money just sitting in an account when I could be doing something \u201cproductive\u201d with it.",

            "comment": "$6k is an awesome start at your age! \n\nHowever, it won\u2019t go as far as you think it will. \n\nYou have so many goals, so here\u2019s what I\u2019d advise you do:\n\n- Start studying investing and get a paper account to practice with. A paper account doesn\u2019t have real money in it, but you can practice strategies using the real-time markets with no risk. Almost all brokerage accounts would require more than $6k anyways.\n\n- Save the $2k for your certification when you turn 18.\n\n- Visit your grandparents in Vietnam! Those types of chances become rarer and rarer as we enter college/career/bills/family, and your Grandparents won\u2019t be around forever. Do it now! \n\n- Wait on the whole van life idea. It\u2019s a really cool experience/dream but it\u2019s SOOOO expensive. Buying and outfitting a van can easily cost $20k or more. Not to mention how expensive and frequent mechanical repairs are, gas, and safety concerns. Just keep saving and put this on the back burner till you\u2019re 18 or older.",

            "comment": "Great job and great goals. Now how would you be paying for college, medical school? Is going to Medical School in Vietnam an option? like maybe for free? I have dual citizenship in my birth country and could have gone back for free college/Medical School but I didn't want it THAT bad and went to nursing school here instead.\n\nAlso that sounds like a lot of money for CNA certification you might be able to find a place that would pay for it if desperate enough (hospital, nursing homes). You can start as young as 16. I worked my way through nursing school as a Nursing Assistant (old title). Might want to do a bit of volunteer work in a hospital and see what your tolerance of 'gross' is LOL.   \n\n\nVisiting Grandparents especially if older is also a good to do thing. I went back 3 times before I bought my first house. I was supposed to go back for that summer but it was not doable that year and then they died shortly after. I feel a sense of guilt even decades later for not going that year, my parents went and my grandmother sent some china pieces I had always liked with my Mom. sometimes you don't get do overs :(",

            "comment": "Great job! \n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d go to Vietnam. Travel while you are young and your grandparents are still there. It gets harder the older you get, so go now and don\u2019t worry too much about the cost. \n\nNext save 2k for your certificate while also looking for options that may pay for the certificate. \n\nIf you want to try investing, open a Roth IRA and put 1-2k in index funds. Your older self will thank you that you started contributing so young.",

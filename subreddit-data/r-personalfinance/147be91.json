    "postText": "Hello,\r  \n\r  \nit is my first time posting on this subreddit and was wondering if anyone can offer any advice to see if I am doing things correctly. A little back story, I am 25 years old and just started my career at a reputable company. My gross income is 80K/yr. My company offers the standard benefits, you all know, like medical, dental, vision, etc. I am currently enrolled in these benefits. Also, they offer a 401k along with a match. I decided to opt in a Roth 401k and contribute 8% of my paycheck. Currently, all the money is in S&amp;P 500. In addition, I opened an HSA and my employer and I will contribute a total of about $3,200 this year. I guess what I am looking for is any advice in order to make the most out of my money. If there is any suggestions on what to change, any accounts to open, etc. it would be appreciated. As mentioned before, this is my first job and I am just trying to learn from this amazing subreddit. Thanks in advance!",

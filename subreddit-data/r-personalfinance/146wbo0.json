    "postText": "So the title explains itself, I\u2019m thinking of buying a home then use that home as a collateral to get a loan from a bank. Then use that loan to buy home oversea, Hong Kong to be exact then use that home as a collateral to buy another home in Hong Kong. Rent both of them out. Once paid off do the same thing in Thailand for a pricer property. Basically monopoly at this point. Im also multi nationalities carrying 3-4 nationalities so that is a benefit for me as well. Thoughts?",

You'd be on the hook for multiple mortgages and your only means of paying them is the rent you collect. That's a recipe for disaster.",

But if your tenants lose their jobs and you have extended vacancies due to the global recession, can you make up the difference. Best stick with one rental, build equity, stack cash for another down payment. When the economy recovers a little then continue. But right now is not the time to buy at least with these interest rates. Be patient.",

    "postText": "The suit was filed January 18th 2017, by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) against Navient. \n\nFirst, know that the CFPB has requested that the Court order Navient to comply with the following actions, among others: \n\n1. Restitution to consumers harmed by Navient's conduct; \n\n2. Disgorgement of all ill-gotten revenue\n\n\nHere are the details of the allegations: \n\nFrom [consumer affairs .com](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/feds-sue-student-loan-servicer-navient-011817.html): \n&gt;Specifically, the suit charges that Navient:\n&gt;&gt; Fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts;\n\n&gt;&gt; Steers struggling borrowers toward paying more than they have to on loans;\n\n&gt;&gt; Obscured information consumers needed to maintain their lower payments;\n\n&gt;&gt; Deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and\n\n&gt;&gt; Harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans.\n\nFrom the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-navient-lawsuit-20170118-story.html): \n&gt;In its lawsuit, the consumer agency alleged many other borrowers had problems enrolling in programs to reduce payments and Navient instead steered struggling borrowers into plans that made more money for Navient but saddled borrowers with higher costs.\n\n&gt;Specifically, the government alleged that Navient maintained compensation policies that encouraged customer service representatives to push borrowers into forbearance, which allows borrowers to suspend payments without defaulting but does not stop interest from accruing.\n\n&gt;However, most federal student-loan borrowers earned the right in 2009 to enroll in the less costly payment options that are based on their income.\n\n&gt;Although those plans save borrowers money, forbearance was more lucrative for Navient, the agency alleged because the company could enroll borrowers in forbearance in less time and with less staff.\n\n&gt;In all, the servicer slapped borrowers with additional interest charges of up to $4 billion by enrolling them in repeated forbearance plans from January 2010 to March 2015, according to the consumer agency. \n\nIf you want to learn more about this, I highly encourage you to read the original complaint filed with the court by the CFPB. It is VERY readable (not filled with legalese) and reads as an absolutely scathing indictment of a company whose business practices targeted its most vulnerable customers in flagrant violation of the law. \n\nYou can find the original complaint on the [consumer finance .gov website](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201701_cfpb_Navient-Pioneer-Credit-Recovery-complaint.pdf). They also [summarized the complaint on their website](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-nations-largest-student-loan-company-navient-failing-borrowers-every-stage-repayment/). \n\nIn the spirit of this sub, I'm sharing this information because there are plenty of people here who may have been a victim of these alleged practices. Including myself, as I've been paying down my Navient loans since 2012 and have several years to go. \n\nI'm going to read through the complaint again, and if anything important jumps out at me that I haven't mentioned, I'll update this post. \n\n**Edit:**\nAdditional allegations: \n\n(since July 2011) Disregard of borrower instructions when processing payments submitted by check with written instructions from the borrower specifying how the payment should be applied.\n\n(Jan 2010-March 2015) Using uncharacteristically vague email titles like \u201cNew Document Ready to View\u201d to notify borrowers that they needed to renew their income-based repayment enrollment. During this time, the number of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment regularly exceeded 60% of borrowers and resulting, often, in capitalization of interest. \n\n**Edit:** There is no way to know how potentially impacted borrowers will be affected by the lawsuit. We will have to wait and see. Lawsuits of this magnitude often take a LONG time to get resolved. \n\n(edit: formatting, fixed a link)\n",

One loan and was 16k and the other 24. I got a seperation check from the navy and sent a 16k payment over the phone instructing them to pay off the one loan, which they assured me they could do. I was very specific that if it did not pay off the loan I did not want to make that large of a payment.\n\nAfter they had taken the money they decided to distribute the payment across both loans. I called them and they claimed that they did not need to put the money where I specified as they way they disbursed it saved me money.\n\nAfter 2 weeks of calling my bank and Navient multiple times a day I called Navient and told them if they didn't apply the payment on the way I specified I would file a complaint with the CFPB. \n\nAll the sudden they were more than willing to fix my issue and apply my payment to the loan the way I had asked.\n\nTLDR: Fuck Navient and their bullshit.",

I know that in 2007 Bank of America was pulling this shit with my checking account, organizing certain payments and deposits to hit at certain times, and holding others off until midnight. It was done to maximize the number of times you overdraft your account, and thus pay overdraft fees.\n\nThey pulled this stunt on my at the beginning of a month, withholding my electronic deposit paycheck from work when I went to pay bills. Suddenly hit with overdraft fees, ***and then*** they applied my check to the account. At the end, when my entire check had been applied to the negative balance, I was looking at approximately -$100 in my checking account.\n\nI told them to fuck off, pulled my money from savings, and left them with the negative balance on the fucking checking account. They sent a single letter threatening to take it to collections, which they ultimately did not do. They ended up losing about $100 in their attempt to profit from me.\n\n ",

If you're in Columbus, Ohio, for example, and you're making a living in the service industry, I think a night where someone leaves you a $100 tip on a $20 bill is generally a good night and might help you not get hit with an overdraft fee for Chase to collect. If that happens to 10 people in 2 or 3 days, once every 2 to 4 weeks, that's over a hundred people a year who might not have the same story I did.\n\nAs far a petty, yes. It is. But I get to be petty -- I asked my boss when I started with this company, and he said as long as I follow our written policy, I can do what I want when it comes to where I eat, how I tip, what services I use when travelling. Banks are petty when they take overdraft fees for holding onto our money. There's banks who don't, and their profits are great.\n\nAs far as unethical goes, I'm not breaking any rules. I might not be taking into account shareholder value for the company I work for, but I'm given leeway because I make money for the company. If they wanted to crack down on my expenses, they have the right to. I'm not hiding anything. My boss approves my expenses and everyone is happy, so, while I might be able to save a few thousand extra dollars every year by tipping less, I am still following our policy. That being said, I could drink more alcohol like a lot of my colleagues (a lot of Engineers and Architects I work with are alcoholics) and maybe my $20 bill would be $100, and I would leave a $20 tip instead -- but I don't like getting drunk.\n\nI hope that kinda settles those concerns. I did think about it when I first started, but I've seen people do really shady shit, and this isn't that.",

We did all the little things first and then put the rent check through. We checked that everything had cleared that day...like physically showing it had come out of the account on their website (groceries, various errands that day for kids etc) then put the rent through as an electronic check. The next morning it was negative like $500 instead of the $150 we were expecting. Somehow the online account showed the rent through FIRST then the rest of the things that the day before had already showed out. Not pending, fully out. We called the bank and all they would say was we should have payed better attention and/or they allow us to overdraft as a courtesy and it was our fault so they wouldn't do anything. Finally one person waived like 1 overdraft fee but not the remaining like half dozen or so. \n\nWish we had taken a screenshot the day before but we didn't know they would or even could do that. We promptly told them to fk off and changed our direct deposit and refused to pay them. Fk them and their shady ass shit",

They do charge you for unpaid direct debits, but it's \u00a36 per missed payment where it used to be \u00a335 per iirc.  You can transfer money to other people using your phone number, if you have a regular salary coming in for more than 4 months then they will honour DDs that come out a day before you get  paid to not screw you with fees.  They also message you, email you, etc to let you know that a payment is going to make you overdrawn, and give you 24hrs to make a payment into the account to avoid fees being applied.\n\nIt used to be similar to the US with fees and stuff but the govt wasn't having it.  Honestly the service I get these days is amazing, and it's making my day to day life so much easier knowing that I don't have to wrestle with the banks bullshit, and actually that I can do all kinds of things without paying a shit load in fees for the privilege.",

I know that in 2007 Bank of America was pulling this shit with my checking account, organizing certain payments and deposits to hit at certain times, and holding others off until midnight. It was done to maximize the number of times you overdraft your account, and thus pay overdraft fees.\n\n&gt;They pulled this stunt on my at the beginning of a month, withholding my electronic deposit paycheck from work when I went to pay bills. Suddenly hit with overdraft fees, ***and then*** they applied my check to the account. At the end, when my entire check had been applied to the negative balance, I was looking at approximately -$100 in my checking account.\n\nTD Bank currently does this. Deposited a check? Gotta wait 3 days. Waited the 3 days then paid a bill? Let's pay the bill out first because the check didn't \"fully clear\" ans overdraft you. Oh, you went under $100 or overdrafted? Let's charge you a $15 service fee.",

The amounts would vary from around 20 to sometimes over 100. Call the bank and they tell me that they use customer money to pay their bonds or whatever. I dont know banking, so i dont know the terms they used. Then they tell me that the money would be refunded back to my account at the end of the month.

If you get a windfall of some kind or manage to save some money, and you want to pay more toward your student loan debt, you can't because Navient will expect that kind of payment from then on.  Tax returns, settlements, savings, etc all can not be used to pay down student loans when they're serviced by Navient unless you have tens of hours within a week to devote to the process of fixing their aggressive move.  That involves filling out income based repayment plan paperwork to fight for them to change back the amount due.\n\nThat's only the tip of the iceberg.  My experience with student loan servicers in general has been that the system is designed to discourage you from paying off your debt, and to financially destroy you if you try to.  \n\nI got sick, couldn't make payments, defaulted, went through student loan rehabilitation, and Sallie Mae intentionally left loans out of consolidation until I was forced to consolidate multiple times.  Once I managed to finally get everything consolidated, they handed off the loans to Navient.  \n\nWith the interest rate I have now, I will never pay off my debt unless I win the lottery or get a scholarship for a higher degree, complete it, and find much higher-paying employment.  As in, approaching six figures.  Considering that requires networking in a way I can't possibly do while working to support a family, much less working and studying too, I don't think it will happen.  But I've applied for scholarships to try anyway.\n\nNow, consider the impact this kind of debt has on credit.  Buying a home is just not going to happen for my family, full stop.  \n\nAnd that too is ridiculous because the rent in my area is generally three to four times higher than a mortgage note, plus taxes, plus insurance.  It would be possible to pay off the student loan debt if we could buy a house instead of pay some rent-seeker's mortgage, tax, insurance, and maintenance costs plus profit.  But, no, the system isn't designed to get debts paid off.  It's designed to ensure you're in debt and financially stagnant for life.\n\nI think we're witnessing the total commercialization of housing.  The cost of a modest single family house in a decent neighborhood jumped 300% in my area *this year alone*.  It's as though there's a push for a few companies to own everything, forcing everyone else to rent.  It's quickly becoming hopeless that most of our generation will treadmill for the rest of our lives.\n\nThese two things together are destroying my quality of life.  I have a decent job that I like, but every time I think of these things at work, it destroys all morale.  I feel like a slave, constantly working my ass off just to keep ratty quarters and food while getting nowhere.  You only get one life, and between student loans and housing, these companies are taking mine.",

I spent forever on the phone and finally talked with someone who had to put me on hold(for a verry long time)to talk to their manager to approve the redistribution to the way I originally wanted it online. Then it was never fixed. It wasn't worth my time to go through that B.S again so I just made another payment when I saved up the money. ",

When you say \"they've been capitalizing my interest\", what do you mean exactly? Your payments should go towards your interest and then your principal, so there shouldn't be any interest month to month, unless you're paying strictly interest.\n\nCapitalizing means they add the interest onto the principal, which means a bigger amount for interest to be calculated from. If you're repaying normally and are never late, I can't see why there would be instances of capitalized interest. Could you maybe elaborate on what they've been doing?\n\n\nThe issue here is that they pushed people into forbearance, which may have seemed nice since they didn't need to pay, but that just made it so Navient was able to accrue interest on a bigger sum. So basically Navient said, \"yeah no problem, don't pay us, we'll just build up a bunch of interest\". When what would really benefit the customer and was within their rights was to enter into lower monthly payments.",

They somehow managed to defer his loans for another 4 years (resulting in total of 8 years of deferment), but provided me with no assistance. I'm pretty certain they're trying to sell my loan because they've also sent me some offers for consolidating and re-signing loans for being a timely paying customer.

I suspected something was off with the allocations &amp; needed some help doing the math.  \n\nI've been making steady payments for years and it looks like my debt is BARELY decreasing. My calculation at the rate they are applying my payment, it'll be 30 more years before I'm clear. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nBut I guess loan consolidation advice is a whole other question for another day... Now I just want to know if this applies to me?\n\nMy loans were originally Sallie Mae in 2009 and transferred to Navient in 2012 (2013?). But I didn't catch this peculiarity, that's probably been happening for a while, until 2015. \n\nTL;DR - If I suspect I'm a victim (similar payment errors), but don't fall exactly in the borrowing dates listed (but my loans were transferred within them), should I write to the CFPB?

As the loan progresses, the amount going to principal increases and the amount going to interest decreases.\n\nI wrote this up a while back if you want more details: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ub2mp/how_loan_interest_works_aka_why_is_half_my/",

But the Bureau believes that Navient steers many borrowers into forbearance, an option designed to let borrowers take a short break from making payments. But interest continues to add up during forbearance.\n\nLast year I was injured and could only work a small number of hours a week for a while. Because of this I couldn't afford my bills and called to let Navient know about the situation. They told me my only option was to forbear. When I asked how long I could get a forbearance they let me know I could have it indefinitely, I would have to apply again every few months but it wouldn't be rejected. Guess as long as it's growing interest they don't care",

My problem falls under the first allegation listed: \n\n&gt;Fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts;\n\n I have Navient pull my monthly payments out of my checking account because I'm on a graduated payment plan and my interest rates fluctuate slightly. So the payment is slightly different every month and I got tired of getting late fees for being short by $.50 even though I was $5 over the previous month. So what they do is go ahead and pull the right amount of money out of my checking account, but then instead of spreading it appropriately over the four loans I have with them, they'll only apply it to three making the fourth one late. Once it's late it no longer qualifies for auto payments so they stop pulling money out. I have to call them and argue for 10 minutes with whoever I get on the phone about math. I will literally have to do a math problem with them explaining that 'No, my payment wasn't actually late, you fucked up.\" I then have to wait for them to fix shit in their system before I can go in and re-enroll my loan for auto payment. In the meantime they'll let me know that my next payment might be due before the auto pay goes into affect so I have to make a manual payment to keep that from happening. I don't always get my late fees back either. So they're basically stealing that from me.\n\nThis happens at least every six months. Not so shockingly, the loan that often seems to end up being late is the one that I have a cosigner on. I can't have the cosigner removed unless I have at least 12 months of on time payments. ",

I'll literally go down a list of numbers and ask the CSR to add/subtract/whatever and it will take ~20 minutes before they finally see the problem. They they \"forward my case for investigation\" which takes anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks to resolve. Meanwhile, I accrue late fees on late fees. \n\nI actually submitted a complaint to the CFPB regarding this practice a year or two ago. They waived my fraudulent late fees \"in a gesture of good faith\" without admitting any guilt on their part.  \n\nAnother annoying practice is that they will focus payments on loans with the lowest interest rates. It got so annoying to try and deal wit this that I had to cut my payments down to the minimum interest and then apply the extra manually to the highest interest rate loans every month.",

You would probably just get paid if there was a settlement or judgment. ",

After the third such incident I adjusted as follows:\n\nFor conversation sake, lets say bill was due every month on the 28th.\n\nI had my autopay posted on the 20th of each month for the monthly payment amount.  I then setup an additional autopayment on each individual loan of an additional $2 on the 24th.  (you could schedule as many 'extra' payments as you wanted for up to 1 year in advance.)  \n\nThis gave it time for the large auto-pay payment to be processed across all 4 loans.  If one fell shy 0.75 or 0.50, the additional $2 payments that were setup to be towards specific loans would cover it.\n\nThis worked well but needed to be 'rebalanced' every 6 months, because I was then \"paid in advance\" and during rebalance time they adjusted my minimum monthly payment lower so that it extended for the term of the loan.  Which screwed it all up again.\n\nNote:  I received a notice last year indicating that my SML were transferred to Navient due to some regulatory BS (and the name change reflected on my credit report).  They've been paid in full for 5 years now, so things could have changed.",

Why? Financial gain. Someone going into WDF or some other programs don't pay them very well. So they talked them into bigger payments and programs that benefited the company not the consumer. ",

Instead, they were applied to future payments in an odd way.  They were held by Sallie Mae/Navient in case I missed a payment.  This was unlikely because my payments were automatically withdrawn from my checking account.  I didn't realize this was being done with my extra payments until I saw I had paid ahead many months.  I called to ask about this and was told that if I wanted any funds to be applied to my principle, I had to send my check with a letter stating this explicitly and specifying which loan(s) I wanted the check applied to.  Later, I called to ask if the funds being held in case I missed a payment could be applied to principle and was told they already had been in a sense.  No matter how many people I had spoke with, I was never able to understand what happened to those funds.  No one could explain it so that I could understand.  I'm not stellar with these kinds of things, so it very well could have been my mistake.  \n\nI paid off my loans last year, so I just gave up trying to make sense of it all.  It was very frustrating to not understand how thousands of dollars could not be accounted for.  \n\nSallie Mae/Navient certainly cleaned up their act, though.  By the end of my loan, I could easily apply funds without having to type a letter and mail a check.  That was great!\n\nEven though I think I was affected by Sallie Mae breaking the law, I see how the government suing Sallie Mae/Navient could affect me.  ",

I thought I was doing the right thing. \n\nMy loans have double since I left school. Moved across the country, found a real job and have been paying $1,000 - $13,000 a month for the past 2 years. \n\nI have so much fear and anxiety around this, it has taken over my life. ",

I have been making income driven $243 monthly payments since September of 2016. \nAlso it might be important to note that my state (WA) has one of the two Attorney Generals behind this lawsuit. Should I be writing or emailing my AG's office to add my name to the suit?\nPlease let me know if anyone has any ideas of how a similar lawsuit ended and what happened to the consumers that were affected by the ruling.

During this time the interests keep accruing and is added to the principal. Almost all servicers have what are called IBR (Income Based Repayment) plans that are available such as PAYE (Pay As You Earn) where they calculate your payments using your Marital Status, Family Size and Adjusted Gross Income for the first fiscal year. After every year they recertify you meaning they recollect income data for the following year along with family size and marital status and recalculate your payment this is called a REPAE (Revised Pay As You Earn) program. Never let them defer your loans or place them on a forbearance. If youre unsure of your servicer you can actually transfer your loans to the federal government. You can submit whats called a DLC (Direct Loan Consolidation) application and in 30 days the federal government will buy the eligible loans off your current servicer and transfer them into one loan and one single payment method. Simultaneously you can submit an IBR with them as well and lower your payments considerably and if you meet certain criteria you can get your loans discharged altogether. \n\nThe website is https://fsaid.ed.gov\n\nIf you ever want to check the status of your loans go to https://fsaid.ed.gov and create an account, once you've created an account it takes about 3 days for the Social Security Administration to verify your indentity. But you can go to www.nslds.ed.gov immediately and see all your loans and what status theyre in and who is your servicer. Thats important if youre entering default status. At which point youd have to enter a rehab program to get you out of it and its huge headache, where they intercept your taxes and/or garnish your wages. There are ways to get around it. If you guys have any questions hit me up I can shoot you the info. I work in this industry and we make money helping borrowers either lower their monthly payments or discharge their loans altogether.  ",

This semester I am just enrolled in one credit because I actually done with my PhD but I must be enrolled to defend my dissertation.  \n\nI was aware that 1 credit is not enough to qualify for deferment and that my repayment period would start on 12/17/2016.  On January 6th, I received an email from Navient titled \"Deferment Approved.\"  The body of the email had no dates, but said, \"Congratulations, your request for deferment has been approved!\" and linked to my account for further info.\n\nBeing a fool and assuming that I had been approved for further deferment as the title and body of the email suggested, I didn't log in to check the details.  On January 16th, they emailed me to say my account was past due.  As it turns out, the deferment that I was *approved* for was the deferment that had just ended in December; the one that I had already been approved for in August.  I paid my bill and called them to say exactly what they are being sued for, that their email seemed intentionally misleading and that I had made my payment.  They told me that it wasn't misleading and that the date of deferment that I had been *approved* for was clearly written and basically that I was a lazy degenerate for not realizing that email did not contain new information about my account.\n\nSo, just to corroborate the stories of others, these guys are slimy fucks.",

Sure, that would probably ruin Navient - but it would be a strong message that \"this shit will not fly.\" That would be nice.... instead, I imagine it'll just be a meager refund check.",

I pay online each month and specify exactly how many $ go to each loan.  If I want to pay extra on the highest interest loan I add more $ to my payment on that loan. It seems strange to me so many people could have issues with selecting how their payments are distributed... i mean does everyone really send navient a check each month? ",

Not one of them will see jail time because not one person did it, the entire company was invloved. Their legal teams are the best of the beSt and they have more funds available than uncle sam wants to waste to try these people. So in the end the people who should be in jail will be even more rich, the people who were hurt might see a tiny fraction of the money stolen, and it's going to be business as usual.

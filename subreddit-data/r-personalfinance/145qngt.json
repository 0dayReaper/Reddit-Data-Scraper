    "postText": "About to turn 23, Dropped out, became UPS driver. I make around 100k/year before taxes and my monthly bills are about $1500/month. I have 35k saved up after I just put 15k down on a toyota4runner that cost 30k. I still live with my parents. They are good parents, but I kind of want to start my own life soon. I can't bring anyone over and I have a small tiny room. Buying an actual house sounds unappealing because I'll be locked into a 30 year mortgage at a high interest rate. Heres where I'm getting at. I have the opportunity to rent out a house between 2 other friends and that would add another $1000/month in bills.   \nCurrently, I'm saving about $4000/month and I would like advice on whether I should stick it out and keep saving at an accelerated rate to get ahead in life or just start my own life and save less. What would you do if you were in my situation? And I understand how blessed I am to be in this situation, I would like others' opinions though.",

What's stopping you from home purchase (making sure you can afford it solo) and renting rooms out to your friends.\n\nYou're body is prob fine now with the work you're doing, but whose to say that will last until retirement. The best thing you can do is invest both financially for retirement and set yourself up for a less physical career. Can even be with the same company. Always have an exit strategy.",

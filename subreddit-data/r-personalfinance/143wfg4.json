The fact that you are thinking about it that young is a great sign. If you are debt free and have disposable income, I would park in the Target date fund (2060). I recommend this because it is the most convenient and predictable. Then read \"I will teach you to be rich\" by Ramit Sethi to cover the basics of personal finances.

Because if you don\u2019t than it\u2019s really a moot question and by default you\u2019d be pushed into ETFs. If you do, I\u2019d just do mutual funds, VTSAX specifically. I say that because, and this may be an incorrect assumption on my part, a 20 year old might be tempted to do frequent trading in and out during the day. Mutual funds are purchased at the end of day end of story, so it eliminates inter day trading. Better for long term investing as it takes emotion out of the equation which is a big thing for new investors. Otherwise mutual funds and ETFs are extremely similar investment vehicles. After you meet the minimum investment amount for vanguards admiral funds you don\u2019t have to meet it again.",

ETFs generally must be bought in whole shares, which can leave a few un-invested dollars sloshing around in your account, which I find annoying. Secondly, MFs are priced once a day at around 6:00 p.m., while ETFs price fluctuates during the trading day. If a big market decline is underway, it can be disconcerting to log in to your account and see the value of your shares going down in real time. Some investors would be tempted to sell and try to \"mitigate their losses\" which of course is the wrong thing to do. This kind of temptation is blunted if your money is in mutual funds, which are not priced in real time.",

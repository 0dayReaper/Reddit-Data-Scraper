    "postText": "My wife (22F) and I (22M) currently make $280K combined income. I just got promoted and am expecting a $70K/year increase.\n\nOur current financial situation:\n-\tNo debt\n-\town a ~$30K car outright.\n-\t$30K in my 401K, $25K in individual brokerage and Roth\n-\twife has $7K in 401K - she will increase contribution to max it out this year, about the same in Roth\n-\t$70K in HYSA earning 4%\n\nOur run rate is just under $8K month. We live in a VHCOL area, so rent+utilities+food+gym makes up 75% of this. $95K annually\n\nAll of our money is shared equally.\n\nCurrently, I am thinking of increasing my post tax 401K contribution for the mega back door route, but not sure if that\u2019s advisable at my age.\n\nWe would like to buy a house, but not sure if that will be a possibility anytime soon. We need at least $2M for a decent neighborhood with a reasonable commute - and that\u2019s shooting for a 2 bedroom.\n\n-\tare there any tax strategies we should be aware of?\n-\tis real estate investing a reasonable proposition in other states? We would like to avoid further exposure to the stock market due to my job paying heavily in RSUs.\n-\twhat other investment vehicles should we look into?\n-\tlooking to have kids late 20s, I assume we should open a 529 then?\n-\tis it worth paying for someone to do our taxes? With upcoming RSU vests not sure what our taxes will look like.",

It\u2019s a pain in the ass in general, certainly not a burden I\u2019d want at that age, and the return is really only there if you play the long game and build up multiple successfully operated properties. Also the debt isn\u2019t cheap anymore and that makes deals a lot harder to pencil. There\u2019s a reason sophisticated operators are hoarding cash - they are focusing on keeping existing assets running smoothly and keeping powder dry for distressed assets that hit the market. It\u2019s not as easy or turnkey as TikTok makes it seem. I wouldn\u2019t even be in a rush to but a primary residence. Save cash for that and other uses, yes, but the flexibility has a lot of value in your 20s and you can afford to rent wherever you damn well please. No need to be in a rush to drop an anchor.\n\nI\u2019d focus on padding the retirement and investment accounts. Every dollar you contribute now goes extremely far with your time horizon. It will enable you to have the flexibility to not be married to you work or your city later in life if you want to take a step back to have kids, start a business, whatever.\n\nAlso let\u2019s talk about expenses. Rent, utilities, food, and the gym is $8k? Are you paying $6k in rent or something? Is there actually more in that $8k figure than you listed? I get you live in a VHCOL but there are decently located 2BRs under that rental rate and for sale under $2mm even in New York and San Francisco.",

Currently need a 2nd bedroom for an office as my wife is remote and I am hybrid. To be honest, there is little price difference in 1B\n\nUtilities: $200-600 our current place had extremely high utilities due to poor insulation. Moving soon\n\nGym: $500 - we are moving, so more gyms may become an opportunity\u2026 the gym selection is very poor here and it\u2019s a priority for us. The cheaper the gym, the longer your workout takes due to crowds\n\nFood: spending $1K on groceries+eating out is pretty easy here.\n\nThat\u2019s $5500-$6000. I said 75% of our expenses were in those categories.",

Invest in tax-efficient mutual funds with low turnover in your brokerage account (not target date funds). If you donate to charity, donate appreciated stocks from your brokerage account first.\n\nIt's fine to not want kids right now. But, be careful trying to put it off a long time. For many people it's not as simple as deciding you want kids and instantly getting pregnant.",

We need at least $2M for a decent neighborhood with a reasonable commute\n\n$2M for a home with max of 70K in a HYSA - that means very little by way of down payment available if you have to keep an emergency fund and pay for closing costs etc.\n\n&gt; Expenses: $3.8K rent \n\nA 2M loan (if you could get it) would mean a mortgage instalment (P+I) at around 13K. Adding interest, taxes and other expenses would raise it even more.\n\nDifficult to justify paying 10K more when you could just rent.\n\nDo a full fledged rent vs buy calc to make sure; but even if the calc suggests a buy, you definitely need to build up more liquid funds for down payment etc. More likely you'll find it doesn't make sense.\n\n\n&gt; Currently need a 2nd bedroom for an office as my wife is remote and I am hybrid.\n\nYou haven't mentioned the specific location (whether Bay Area or NYC or other) - but the fact that your wife is remote AND that your work is hybrid MAY open up a different option. It depends on what the \"hybrid\" means; is it going to the office regularly one or two days of the week? Or going in for specific f2f events? Some other?\n\nI've seen some folks with this kind of situation leverage their high pay + the fact that they don't need to be in office often to move to a different (medium COL). \n\nBoth examples I'm giving here are folks with jobs in the Bay Area to start with.\n\nOne moved to the Sacramento area; bought a 3 bed home for around 500-600K; has to commute to the office twice a week, takes the Capitol Corridor train up and down.\n\nThe other moved to Portland OR; bought a larger 4 bed home around 700k. In his case he needs to be in the Bay area for about 3-4 days at a stretch once a month on average, plus the occasional day; he flies down by the morning flight / returns by the evening flight for the \"day\" requirement, and stays at a hotel for the 3-4 day stay.\n\nEven with the additional \"travel\" cost - the lower cost of housing + living makes a huge difference.\n\n\n&gt; We would like to avoid further exposure to the stock market due to my job paying heavily in RSUs.\n\nYou aren't exposed to the stock market. Your exposure is to ONE company (your employer) who gives you RSU's.\n\nYour strategy should be to liquidate some of the RSU's as they vest (and maybe all that vest, if you keep getting more RSU's vesting later) - and putting it into a diversified stock portfolio. That minimizes your risk. It may reduce your return (especially if your company does well and grows faster than the market) - but look at this as a risk mitigation approach.",

COL calculators suggest that 200K -225K in Austin is roughly comparable (lifestyle wise) to 350K in the Bay Area (as an example); around 60%. If the gross income hit is 20-25% - you'd be better off because you skip the state income tax in CA; you have a lower expense level etc.\n\nThere are a number of states that have zero state income tax; there are others that have a lower state income tax + lower cost of living than CA or NYC. \n\nNot suggesting you jump overnight; keep this in mind while planning future moves.",

    "postText": "I'm a college student going into my junior year. I'm in a very lucky and comfortable position where I can probably afford to put away 90% of the money I make while I finish my degree for the next two years, roughly 25-30k USD a year that I can stick in my back pocket.\n\nIs my best bet to just deposit it into my current savings or is there something better I could be doing? I currently have 5k in a discover savings account at 4% apy, basically wondering if there's anything better (and equally low risk) out there instead of just sitting on it.",

The first thing you need to do is determine what your goal is with the money and how soon you expect to meet that goal. With that knowledge, you might consider an investment account based on that goal and risk you're will to take. Or, if it's just a rainy day fund, it might be fine right where it's at.",

Or you can pay bills directly from your brokerage account.",

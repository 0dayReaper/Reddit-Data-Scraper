    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nEstate/Trust CPA here.  My dad took out some huge whole life policies for me and my sister when we were babies.\n\nNeedless to say, I\u2019m 26 and this bad boy has 47k of CSV in it (the actual policy is quite substantial).  I\u2019m in estate planning.  I can\u2019t think of a single good reason to keep this thing.  I hate ILITs with a passion and think there are much better tools out there for large size estate planning should I need it.\n\nFurthermore, despite my young age I have amassed several hundred thousand in mutual funds, ETFs, stocks and about 75k in cash through saving as much as I could since starting work at 15.  Not to mention the 450k term policy I have through work.  I have no dependents and as the days go on the opportunity costs of paying these premiums for this essentially junk policy way outweigh what I could do with the cash otherwise.\n\nI can cash in the 47k.  I do know that you can also sometimes sell these policies to an investor.  By my own math using life expectancy tables; the policy is worth about ~97k if you discount the guaranteed death benefit using the guaranteed dividend rate with the amount of periods at my remaining life expectancy (figure I\u2019d walk with 80k after expenses if I can find a buyer).  However, I see most of these investors want medium and not ultra long term investments.  Does anyone know of anywhere that works with people my age?  Or am I better cashing the sucker in?\n\nThanks!!!!",

            "comment": "If you were an investor would you want to buy a policy that might pay you back in 50 years? You really, are trying to put two investments together. One is the cash value and the other is the expected death benefit value. You might approach the question differently, and look at the cost of the insurance, second, what is the best way to invest the money for the future. Most companies looking to buy a life policy are looking for a much, much shorter pay out period.",

I\u2019m basing my math on the guaranteed amount.\n\nNML cooked up a rosy picture on the expected value so I\u2019d never discount based on that.  \n\nAnd I agree on the 50 year payout.  I don\u2019t see how cashing out and buying a slightly \u2018safer\u2019 mutual fund with a bond allocation is a bad idea here (IE Vanguard Wellington).  The cost of the current policy is bonkers compared to my other expenses lol and I have that term policy that\u2019s essentially free to me so why would I keep the whole life?",

The tool uses the principles of \u201cFreeze, Squeeze and Burn.\u201d\n\nThe freeze is the gift is valued at todays value and further upside is out of the estate once gifted.\n\nThe squeeze refers to if you gift a business interest gift.  You can usually get significant discounts on the value when doing these gifts so a lot of times there\u2019s immediate benefit.\n\nThe burn is you continue to pay the taxes on the assets in the trust.  This is not a gift and increases your asset usage rate; hence the burn.\n\nGrantor trust sales are more complex.  In a BDIT sale someone else seeds the trust and you sell your business or whatever to it for a note.  The trust pays you in installments.  No unified credit is used and these sales are heavily used when we can take big discounts on valuations.  Same IDGT principles apply except if set up properly you can still access the funds even though the trust is irrevocable.  \n\nAll talk to attorney territory.",

That\u2019s a mature policy likely earning substantial dividends at this point, safely and tax free.  As a CPA and estate planner, I\u2019d brush up a bit on what you have there.

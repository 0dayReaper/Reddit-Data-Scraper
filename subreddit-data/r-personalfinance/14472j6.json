    "postText": "Hi PF. It appears I\u2019m going to have a temporary 3-4 month period where I\u2019ll have two children in daycare that will likely put us over our monthly budget. Is better to dip into savings/sell securities to cover the gap or reduce 401k contributions for the period? I currently contribute 9% (3% match) and my wife contributes 12% (no match). We will be 38 and 41, respectively. \n\nAppreciate your thoughts.",

But it sounds like the overage isn't astronomical the way you wrote it",

No eating out, movies, subscriptions you don\u2019t really need, etc. cut those things first, then dip into savings. After this period, save your money back up and then you can add some of the fun stuff back into your budget. Ideally you can cut back on your budget and cash flow this rather than dipping into anything.",

Why would you NOT use the emergency fund for that and replenish it once the shortfall passes?  What is the advantage to having these additional expenses cost an extra 15% (or more) after taxes?",

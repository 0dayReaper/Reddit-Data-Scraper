Have you done that yet?\n\nOnce you have controlled that, you take a look at your expenses and income in a month. Do you have any extra dollars to allocate to paying off debt?\n\nOnce you have understood both, then you can look at a personal loan. You don't want to get a personal loan and then continue using the credit card. This will put you into a bigger hole.",

Don't have it.\n\nAs for how, you need a budget where you get to the minimum you need to spend to live an ascetic lifestyle and then you attack the debt until it goes away!",

If there is even a sliver of a doubt you double the debt, just aggressively pay the CC directly.",

If you get the loan, cut the cards in half and get rid of them. Maybe get a replacement once the loan is paid off and you can responsibly use a credit card.",

So list out all of the CCs with their interest rate/payment/balance, and then all of your other bills and spending.  That way people will know what's there, and what you're working with.\n\nGenerally, you should try to cut back any extra spending you can, to free up money to pay on the cards.  If you want to save the most money, you'd rank out the CCs in order from highest interest rate to lowest.  Make the minimum payments on all cards other than the highest interest rate one.  Put all your extra money against that card.  Do that monthly until it's paid off.  Then repeat with the next highest rate card.  In the meantime, if you can get a personal loan with an interest rate lower than the cards, you can use that to move the debt to a better rate.  But you'd still go through the same process of prioritizing whatever is the highest interest debt for payment.\n\nLong term.....get your budget balanced.  Get yourself in the habit of not spending more than you're making.  That way you stop racking up credit card debt, and you can avoid being in this same boat 5 years from now.",

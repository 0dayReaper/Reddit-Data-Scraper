    "postText": "I (28m) have been living with my parents/siblings forever. My parents have foster children and both have full time jobs. I started college but dropped out once i realized how much the loans/etc would end up being. Having foster children requires an adult to be at home when the children are home, so i watched the children when my parents were at work. Since one of my parents now has the summer off, i can now get a job of my own and continue to have this job even past the summer. (I have, $19 hr, bi-weekly pay. For a decent sized company in a stocking department. 401k Insururance etc.)\n\nNow, that being the case, I do not own a car of my own. I use a family car. (We have a car for every person but it's not mine by name.) I have 0 debt, i have never rented or lived away from my family, and have no credit score. (I don't spend money on things basically ever.) I have saved my first few paychecks and have spent just a bit little money on comfortable boots/insoles for work, gas for the car, and maybe a meal if i forgot my lunch.\n\nI have around $3000 in my checkings account and am planning to not change my lifestyle for a while yet. (Hoarding money like a dragon.)\n\nLiving with my family isn't an issue, we are on great terms and they would have me live here until the day i die if that is what i wanted, but i want to move out in the future and begin to live my own life.\n\nMy main concerns are that i have no credit, no concrete plan on the steps to take, and which route would be the best.\n\nAny tips or advice anybody could give me would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: Also some advice for increasing my wealth. I don't buy things friviously, go out to eat/order food, or go to concerts etc, i just hold onto money. I see many options talked about but i don't know the best for my current situation,",

            "comment": "First step to building your credit is get a credit card. Since you have no history you will probably end up with a secured card or one with a low limit. Use it for some of your expenses, make sure the balance at the end of the statement period is low relative to your credit limit, and most importantly pay it off IN FULL every month.\n\nTo move out on your own you should target:\n-Earning at least 3x the rent payment every month (many landlords will require this)\n-Savings of 3-6mo essential living expenses (rent, food, transport, utilities)\n-Budget that includes saving at least 10-15% of your income in 401k / Roth IRA / other retirement accounts\n\nIf you\u2019ve never spent much of your own money before it\u2019s probably going to feel really expensive and overwhelming. The $3k you have saved is enough to live on for maybe 6-8 weeks, depending on what part of the country you\u2019re in. But if you can get yourself set up with reliable income (keep working on increasing it!) and a balanced budget you should be able to manage it. Good luck!",

I don't know if specific banks matter for something this simple, but I currently use a local bank. It's not a large or big-name bank in the slightest.",

The going rate for them right now is around 4% which is considerably more than your checking account. I\u2019d still keep a little more than a month\u2019s worth of expenses in your checking since it takes a couple days to transfer out of the savings account if needed.",

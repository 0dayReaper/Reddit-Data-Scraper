    "postText": "So I set up my power for the first time in a US state with the local power company, and they gave me two options for payment:\n\n1. Any form of payment, $200 security deposit\n2. Bank info (routing #, account #), auto pay, no security deposit\n\nMy dad who is much older is advising against letting them access my bank account. Is this a valid concern or is it a safe means of payment. Thank you!",

The hassle of going back and forth with a new agent every time I call them isn\u2019t worth the $60 the company owes me. But even after that, sometimes it\u2019s the better option so you\u2019re not stuck with the fee for using a card. To each their own, but I\u2019d prefer to use my CC if possible for the cash back.",

I\u2019ve never been overcharged using the bank system, because *I* set it up, *I* manage it. If I want to stop paying someone, I click \u201ccancel payment\u201d and it\u2019s stops, *right then*.\n\nAs I said, I\u2019ve done this with every bank I\u2019ve had since 1995 - I open my banking app/website, setup who gets paid, how much, and when, and click go. The bank will verify if the vendor accepts electronic payments, if they don\u2019t the bank will mail a check. Once the vendor cashes the check, the banking system will update the electronic banking information and send any further payments electronically.  Today you can do it with your phone, in seconds. \n\nYou can do autopay (so it goes every month automatically, or whatever you schedule), or you can \u201cmanually\u201d send payments.\n\nManaging it yourself every month is nothing more than entering the amount and clicking \u201csend\u201d. That\u2019s the same effort as verifying your vendor did it right, the difference being that you have no control over what a vendor does.\n\nIf a vendor accidentally overbills you $1000, you\u2019re out that money until the bank can get it reconciled. If you\u2019re doing the sending from your bank, that\u2019s not an issue. Since you\u2019re sending a payment from your own account, you can stop payment at any time.\n\nIn the end they\u2019re using the exact same system, just changing who controls it, you or a vendor.",

Here are a couple links:\n\n* [Introduction to Tax Brackets](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/basics-of-us-income-tax-rate-schedule)\n* [Introduction to Deductions](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/tax-deductions-introduction)\n* [A link to all lessons in the Tax Portal](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic)\n\nAnd since retirement accounts tie into deductions:\n\n* [Link to the Retirement Accounts lessons](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/investment-vehicles-tutorial/ira-401ks/v/traditional-iras)\n\nAs an added bonus:\n\n* The [personalfinance Wiki on Taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes) (may need an update for Tax Year 2016).\n\nLet me know if there's anything related I should add to this list. Happy filing!",

Why reinvent the wheel?\n\nThat said, it's unsettling having to pay tuition and then receive something that is given away for free in return. Lectures by mediocre teachers should be phased out in favor of online courses where the professor is actually good at teaching. Then colleges can focus on office hours and testing. But that would require universities and professors to have self-awareness and cut both tuition and profits.\n\nA good bit of my engineering degree was enduring horrible local lectures, and watching MIT OpenCourseWare lectures to actually learn the concepts for the tests. It seems so wasteful to give the same lecture over and over again, when the lectures have already been perfected and published for free online.",

I would much prefer digesting a lecture in my own time, stopping whenever necessary, listening multiple times when I was struggling to grasp a concept, and spending the class time actively using what I learned with the prof ready to field my questions as well as listening to others' questions.\n\nI only had one class like this that I wasn't too keen on, and I think it was more that the prof was still working on setting up the lectures correctly and relied too heavily on a book that didn't describe concepts well.\n\nEdit: and Khan got me through Calc when no lecture or book would help. It sure made econ and finance easier as well.",

Thanks Arizona for fighting for that last place spot... we started my daughter at 3 and let her just do what she wanted, what she was interested in, when she wanted. Now at 5 we have a more regimented schedule but with more flexibility. For instance, we have a field trip scheduled for this August to Wyoming to see the total solar eclipse and visit Yellowstone and surrounding areas for a few weeks. Something many couldn't have the luxury of doing. She's considerably ahead in all her subjects, and absolutely adores doing school with us.\n\nThe other two (both 2) may or may not end up doing homeschool or public or charter or who knows what. It's really up to what's best for them and where they'll respond best. I'm certainly not against public school, I went myself and I would love to see Arizona fighting for a number one spot instead of dead last, and I'm for increased sustainable spending for education. The truth of the matter for now though is I believe my wife and I can provide a better education and experience for our kids (at least our oldest currently) than the grossly underperforming public schools system can. At least here in Phoenix.\n",

There's homeschool co-ops so if I can't teach writing well (and I probably can't) then another parent can teach writing while I might be more inclined to teach my kids, and theirs (or any number of others) math and science and physics. There's also dance classes and sports and cubscouts and girlscouts, as well as regular homeschool days at the science center and museums and aquariums that we attend. Many of the local homeschool parents regularly attend these as well so you kind of get to know the local homeschool community and your kids get to know those kids.\n\nOff the top of my head, I can think of maybe 15-20 different kids my daughter plays with on a regular basis. And even more she knows from a daycare all the kids go to one day a week (gotta have a break sometimes). The nice thing about this, though, is the ages vary wildly. There's not a group of 5 year olds running about like you might see in school (not that that's a bad thing, just pointing out the differences), but there's groups of kids with 3 year olds and 5 year olds and 7 year old and 8 year olds. It's really big wide and accepting groups that the kids form like this. \n\nNow there's definite merits to public school as well, I absolutely loved my time in high school with all my friends. I'm just trying to inform a little bit about the stigma that \"homeschool kids are unsocialized\". Is it different? Certainly! And I do see those strange homeschool kids from time to time that are often portrayed in the TV and movies, but certainly not everyone is that way and it doesn't have to be that way. ",

It's simply pervasive in our culture. \n\nAs a side note, in the past, many parents chose to homeschool out of fear and a desire to shelter and protect their children.

It's a big myth that homeschooled kids aren't socialized.  Sitting in a classroom with 30 other kids the exact same age doesn't teach them to be sociable with all ages.  Homeschooled kids through groups, field trips, etc. are very socialized.  Make sure to do your research before trying to give advice to someone.",

Before that kids were homeschooled.  Any parent with resources and a way to socialize their kids can do a wonderful job.\nI'm not saying you, but people are truly judgmental and ignorant.",

However, if you, as a parent, are active in the socialization of a child then you're already doing more than a substantial number of home schooled families. It's entirely up to parents/guardians to impart those social skills and set up situations in which they learn these skills. You seem to have done that, but many do not. \n\nStatistically it is still the case that kids who are homeschooled are more likely to have a lack of social skills. It's not that way with every case, but it's that way with such a large number of cases that the statistics whole-heartedly back up the position. Talking about facts and statistics is not condescending in any way, shape or form, it's stating information. ",

So they asked me to take the competency test and I only used Kahn Academy to study. Surprisingly, I ended up scoring higher on the Sociology section than Psychology mostly because it was easier lol.

You can save a lot of money.\n\nI am a lawyer and an accountant.  In my opinion, the IRS does a *great* job of explaining the forms to laypeople.  That's not because I understand the jargon.  I have to explain stuff to laypeople, too, and the IRS really took the time to make it clear and understandable.  Before you spend any money, check out what you can get for free.  It's very good.",

My next suggestion is that if you think you would qualify for VITA, the IRS partners with different tax software providers that offer you their product for free. You can access a provider like turbotax online and file electronically. The software providers offer really good step by step guides for taxpayers with simple forms of income (like VITA).  \n\nIt can always be a bit overwhelming self preparing, but between the software, IRS website, google, and a few helpful overworked accountants on reddit, a majority of Americans could self prepare their returns with relative ease. \n\nThe good news in your case is you don't have to file an income tax return for Florida. Feel free to ask anything else, and i'll try to point you in the right direction. \n\n",

They won't prepare returns (see VITA for that), but if you've some issues with past tax years that need to be resolved before filing, give them a try. \n\nYou can check eligibility and locations here: [https://www.irs.gov/advocate/low-income-taxpayer-clinics/low-income-taxpayer-clinic-income-eligibility-guidelines](https://www.irs.gov/advocate/low-income-taxpayer-clinics/low-income-taxpayer-clinic-income-eligibility-guidelines).\n\n",

The training isn't a joke either, when I first started working there I had to go through the VITA volunteer training and it was about 80 hours total, and I'm a fast learner. The training baseline is [this](https://www.linklearncertification.com/d/) website. After they go through that they have to pass a pretty in depth test which includes them doing full returns. After that, we require them to do 5 practice returns written by our own people that we then quality review. Oh, and the IRS provides TaxSlayer to every VITA site, and it is an extremely great tax preparation program.\n\nThe IRS is extremely picky as to the quality of VITA volunteers, and in the years we've been doing this the number of returns that the IRS rejects from us has been _very_ low.

How to fill out a typical turn off of w-2 and for 1099 payments. Capital gains, divident, social security taxes.\n\n2. How debt works, like credit card debt.\n\n3. How to make a budget. Make kids fill one out at a low income like most kids make just out of school.\n\n4. College debt. Gow long you will pay it off. Direct kids to junior colleges and then state schools to save money.\n\n5. List of common scams. Such as debt consolidators, tax scammers, etc... \n\n6. How to invest in the market. Basics including fees. Alot of mutual funds have deceorive fees and are a scam. Why low cost index funds\nAre best for most people due to low costs. Why its important to save the same amount each month to reduce risk. Wallstreet will hate this... Cause they get rich off fees. \n\n7. How bond investing works. \n\nI would also offer an optional entrepreneurship class that covers how to start a company in your state. Different types of business entities. How business taxes work. How to record profit/loss. Marketing, etc...\nAs someone who ran my own business, this was a bitch to figure out. I had a shitty accontabt for a while. Quite a few small business owners dont know about all the deductions they are missing out on. Make starting a business less greek. Try to get local wntrepreneurs come in and have a \"keep it real\" talk on how much work it is and stuff like that. There are probably lots of people happy to do this. \n\n",

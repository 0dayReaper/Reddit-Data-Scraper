    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m starting two 10 week internships for the summer and I have a couple of W4 questions. The job that pays the most starts first, so that is the W4 I\u2019m currently filling out. \n\n1. The job pays biweekly, but only for 10 weeks. How many pay periods would that be on the multiple jobs worksheet? Would it be 26 because it pays biweekly, or 5 because I\u2019ll only get paid five times for the duration of the job?\n\n2. I haven\u2019t started the second job yet, but will next week (I9 form has been filled out). Do I need to do the multiple jobs worksheet right now?\n\nThat\u2019s all! Thank you!",

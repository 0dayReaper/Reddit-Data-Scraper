    "postText": "I just had a baby and want to open a 529 for college. I\u2019m confused about the withdrawal process. \n\nBased on a few articles I read online, it appears you can withdraw less than or equal amounts of what you\u2019ve spent on room &amp; board, tuition and books.\n\nHowever, my family said withdrawing from their children\u2019s 529 (Massachusetts) was more challenging than the plan is worth. They claimed they could not withdraw funds themselves; the institution who held the 529 funds needed to pay the college bills directly, and that it was often time consuming. They also said they\u2019ve heard other parents with the same problems.\n\nDid the 529 withdrawal process change or something? I\u2019m confused.",

            "comment": "It will certainly vary but provider but for me it's no different than an HSA distribution.\n\nYou fill out a form telling it where you want the money to go and check a box for any of Qualified withdrawal, Qualified withdrawal for K-12 tuition expenses, Withdrawal for Student Loan expenses, Withdrawal for Apprenticeship expenses, or Non-qualified withdrawal and hit go. I'm sure if I were to pick non-qual'd or a distribution in excess of a limit (loan expenses) they'd display some bill or withholding option but so far so good.  \n\nThere's an option to pay the institution directly but why miss out on those sweet sweet credit card points/min. spend rewards?",

They should be able to request a distribution online, over the phone, or via paper form. They can have a check sent to themselves, deposit to their ACH, or a check mailed to the school. In either case it was a quick and easy process.",

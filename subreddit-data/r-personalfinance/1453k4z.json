    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nSo back in 2021 I sold my home I lived in for 3 years during the selling craze to downsize and get a manageable back yard. What was supposed to be a forever home turned into more of a nightmare with one issue after another (started with a terrible VA appraisal that had to get a Senator's office involved to fix) and then just other things with the brand new house that should have had more detail (plumbing, A/C issues) than what was handled.\n\nFinally, after 18 months, we had had enough and put it on the market as I had found a new job to leave the area.\n\nI know for next year I am planning to go visit a paid preparer. And I should know the answer to my question since I passed the REG section of the CPA back in April with an 88, but just want to get a second opinion to make sure my thinking is correct.\n\nI bought my house for $294,900 in 2021 and sold it for $325,000 this month. However,\n\n(1) The builder fleeced us for literally every closing cost under the sun they could. Without even taking the VA funding fee into account which I know isn't included in basis, my cash to close was something ridiculous in the $12K-$15K range and that was with a $5K seller credit towards closing cost. You name it, is was billed to me, even the costs the seller traditionally pays like their portion of the tax stamps transfer, and buying the owner's title insurance policy. I paid points, origination fees, etc. I'm still a little confused as with what can be added to basis in purchasing expenses, but at a minimum from what I can tell from the ALTA statement it would get me to at least $304K or $305K.\n\n(2) About 1 month in, I fenced the back yard in for the dog and paid $2,155. This is the only major upgrade I did to the house.\n\n(3) I sold the house for $325,000 and paid 5% commissions along with my portion of the stamps, title insurance, and other miscellaneous fees. At least $20K in seller expenses from the ALTA statement I'm looking at. \n\nSo I \"got\" $6,200 back at closing, but based on my understanding with how basis works, I shouldn't have a recognized Capital Gain. Is my reasoning correct? I still plan to visit a paid preparer next year, I just don't want to get blindsided with the IRS trying to say I had a recognized $30K gain when I definitely did not as the money I got back didn't even cover the original purchasing closing costs. \n\nThanks.  \n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Where I was getting confused is it looks like some costs can only be deductible for tax purposes if someone itemizes (I don't itemize). \n\nThe sale is more straightforward. I sold for $325,000. I paid $16,250 in commissions, $2,275 in Stamps, $1,075 in Title Policy reissue and about $800 in other miscellaneous fees (I wasn't sure if the prorated taxes for the year could be included or not, if they could that would be another $1,540)\n\nI have the receipt for the fence installation upgrade of $2,155\n\nWhen I bought the home for $294,900 in December I paid something like $3,700 in stamps, $1,525 in Title Insurance/Policy and at least $2,500 in other fees not including taxes or points.",

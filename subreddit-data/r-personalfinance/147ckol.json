Would it be smart to borrow against the house and invest that money to maybe double or triple that money and set me up for the future? Basically my question is there anyway to take advantage of my house being paid for and turn that into money in my bank account? Been posting in this multiple times but can't seem to find the wording I'm looking for, lol",

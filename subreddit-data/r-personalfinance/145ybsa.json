I have a small retirement amount (less than 10k). \n\nI don't know if it makes sense for me to try and roll it into something, or withdraw it and be done with it? I could really use the money for moving cost, but would love any guidance or advice anyone could offer. This is far from something i am knowledgeable about in the slightest. \n\nThank you to anyone still reading ! Please forgive my overall lack of expertise and knowledge in this.",

Plus the withdrawal will be treated as ordinary income depending on your tax bracket.\n\nDo you know your tax bracket?\n\nFor instance if you are in the 12% bracket you will owe an additional 12%.\n\nSo potentially $2200 when all is said and done for a $10,000 withdrawal",

So let\u2019s say you make $75K/yr, and have $75K in your 401K. Your marginal tax rate is probably about 22%. You take the 401K money out, wish counts as income so this year you have $150K, and a marginal tax rate around 24%. Add in the 10% penalty, and the taxes you\u2019d owe on the additional money work out to 34%. It\u2019s not quite 40%, but works for estimating purposes. \n\nOf course, your effective tax rate would be lower because that\u2019s how it works. But for asking \u201chow much of this money will I actually get to keep?\u201d, 60/40 is a good estimate. 65/35 is probably pretty close for most people. In any event, you should really avoid early withdrawals from 401ks if you can at all help it.",

    "postText": "With the student loan pause ending soon, I have saved a bit of money in between- not much- but a bit. I owe $25,000 in loans (grad school, none from undergrad) and have about $2,500 saved up for my loans. That said, I\u2019m wondering if I should shovel the whole $2,500 into the loan immediately or use them as payments come up? I don\u2019t plan to pay the minimum per month, maybe about $500/month instead. I\u2019m graduating in August but would prefer to get on top of this now. \n\nMy pros and cons of paying immediately are: I can split one loan in half (I have 3 loans, long story), that happens to be the lowest by $ but has the highest interest rate. If I do this, I have a job but our contracts have not been renewed. Along with this, I will have to cut my hours from 24/week to 16/week due to the rules of my contract (we have an hours per year cap). \n\nIf I pay $500/month I\u2019m paying more than the minimum, and I can spread out payments over 5 months in case anything happens (you never know). But I\u2019ll start accruing interest with this method. \n\nWould love to know what y\u2019all would do?\n\nBest,\n\nCB",

            "comment": "Given your situation, it may be beneficial to pay off a portion of your student loans immediately with the $2,500 you have saved up. \n\nSince you mentioned that one of your loans has the highest interest rate and splitting it in half would be possible, focusing on reducing that loan first could save you money in the long run. \n\nAdditionally, paying off a significant portion upfront can provide you with a sense of accomplishment and **motivation** to continue tackling your debt. \n\nHowever, considering the uncertainty surrounding your job contracts and the reduction in your working hours, it's also wise to keep a portion of your savings as an emergency fund. \n\nAllocating some funds towards payments over the next few months, while paying more than the minimum, can provide you with financial flexibility in case any **unforeseen expenses** arise. \n\nIt's important to strike a balance between reducing your debt and maintaining a safety net\n\nSome other good options can be found [here](https://www.evenfeed.io/navigating-student-loans-exploring-repayment-options-and-strategies-for-financial-success/)\n\nBest of Luck!",

    "postText": "I did an internship years ago and was hired as a contractor for this. Apparently I was given a 401k during this time which I did not know was a thing for interns. I kept getting mail to  learn more about how to make the best of my 401K which I had thought was sent to every employee. But then I got mail about how I need to update my address for my account. Confused, I logged in and saw I did have a 401k with a balance of $0. How do I close this account? Or should I just leave it? I'm not even sure how to contact HR from the contractor company.",

I don't think I ever received a check in the mail for my 401K, I remember my parents when their old employer's 401K was closed a check was sent in the mail for them. But my account is still open so I guess I shouldn't expect a check.",

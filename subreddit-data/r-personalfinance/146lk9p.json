    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am trying to resolve a debt for my parents. They reached a debt settlement with Citibank two years ago and made most of the payments. However, they failed to make the last two installments because they believed they already concluded the settlement (set to finish in April). Even though my parents owed a minimal amount after two years of payments, they received a notice last month that Citibank had transferred the collection to another agency.\n\nWhen talking to Citibank's internal collections department, they said they could do nothing about the previous settlement and that the agency would now handle collections. Furthermore, they consider the total debt as now owed. This change seems unfair because my parents received no prior notice of the missed payments. There was no indication of a \"past due\" payment, and the transfer to the agency was a surprise.\n\nI then spoke to the agency. They stated that they sometimes honor previous settlement arrangements, but those agreements typically occur in days or weeks, not two months. The agency seemed interested in negotiating a new settlement for a lower amount because Citibank has not sold the debt yet. Making a new settlement is not something outside of financial means, but I'm wondering about the optimal strategy. \n\n1. Is there any possibility of reviving the old settlement?\n2. Is it reasonable to negotiate with the agency and settle, or should I go through the process of validating the debt and moving from there? \n3. How much leverage, if any, do I have to reduce the settlement amount? \n4. If I negotiate with the agency on behalf of my parents, is it worth pressing for a \"pay for delete\"? \n5. Should I avoid communicating over the phone with the agency?\n\nAnswers to any or all of these questions are appreciated. Thanks.",

            "comment": "1. No -- most banks will send debt/sell debt to an external collection organization when these plans are broken. \n2. I mean, you know the debt is valid.   All you're doing is delaying the inevitable. \n3. You can ask for anything, but it doesn't mean you have 'leverage' per se.  They may be willing to accept 50% just to get it closed out, or they may not be--likely depends what the collection company paid for the debt. \n4. It's unlikely you'll get a pay for delete--at least what you are wanting.  For one, it's literally against the precedents set by the CFPB/Regulatory bodies as it undermines the fairness of accurate credit reporting.  For two, the agency can only delete history they they furnished, not history from the previous furnisher (i.e. Citibank). \n5. Do you think messenger pigeon is more appropriate?  They have your parents' debt, just get whatever settlement you agree to with them in writing.  Do not pay a settlement until you have it in hand.",

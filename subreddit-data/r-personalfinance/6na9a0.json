    "postText": "I have seen my company terminate 2 other employees as soon as they gave their 2 weeks notice.\n\nI gave my 2 weeks notice on Wednesday and on Friday was told they were terminating me and they were not intending on paying me for the remainder of the 2 weeks. Fortunately I am able to start Monday with my new company.\n\nAs a word of warning, if you have seen your employer terminate any employees as soon as they give notice DO NOT GIVE NOTICE. You are not legally required to give notice, and if the company does not give the courtesy of letting employees finish out their 2 weeks they don't deserve the courtesy of 2 weeks notice.\n\nEdit: To clarify generally speaking you should give two weeks notice, but it is not required, and there are situations that you should not. Carefully judge for yourself.",

(I did already have a new job offer in hand).\n\nAt a different company that was doing well, and I had a good relationship with my manager, I gave three weeks' notice. They paid me for those three weeks, plus an extra week of separation pay.",

When I found a new place I worked out an agreement between my new boss and my old that was actually SIX weeks' notice. It was enough time for me to start to learn my new position part-time and train my replacement at my old job. I wanted to make sure my old boss had as smooth a transition as possible. \n\n...aaaaaaand I've also seen the other side of that coin, where it would be stupid (and not at all expected) to give a vindictive jerk a two-week period to dump you with no income.

I once gave a very bad attitude 4 weeks severance to match their notice, and marched them out the door. Didn't have too, but if I want others to work with me in the future that's what I got to do. Most wouldn't have cared with that person, but remaining employees saw the action and it enhanced their morale. One even confessed to not taking another offer in part because of it.\n\nPeople join a company, they quit their boss.",

It's my experience that people do not secretly hold grudges ONLY when they are HIGHLY rational people, able to separate ego/feelings from their decisions, putting the business first and not take offense.  It goes without saying that you have a high chance of finding more rational (less emotional) people in fields like software engineering.  Thus, your experience is understandable.  (It is however in my personal experience that ego's are out of control in your industry, moreso than in most others.)\n\nUnfortunately, I would argue 80-90% of all business in the world is not run, or managed, by rational people able to separate emotion from decision.  The world, in general, is controlled by egotistical people.  Thus, in the vast majority of circumstances you should anticipate people secretly being offended and holding it against you, manifesting at a later date.  \n\nBesides, hiring decisions are rarely micromanaged by CEOs and high-level managers who have the most experience generally.  They are usually dictated by mid-to-low level managers who barely have enough maturity to tie their own shoes on a daily basis.  Sometimes hiring managers are fresh out of college HR teams.  This is why there is so much drama and mistreatment in the modern workplace.  ",

I gave four weeks notice to the old place, and after the four weeks is when I started this 60-40 schedule and I will be doing that for another three weeks, so it's really more like seven weeks notice. I am helping to train my replacement, it's a small company and I'm one of the oldest workers there, so I really don't want to screw them, and they're honestly not in a position yet and for me to leave completely. I'm sure there's probably some conventional wisdom that I'm breaking by allowing it to drag on for this long, but I've seen way more workers not work out than have, so I have a pretty good idea of how difficult it is to replace me.\n\nI'm not sure how it works at other places, but I just got an email earlier today from our accountant basically offering to just tack on all of my unused vacation hours on my final paycheck, it's like a weeks worth. It's not money I was ever expecting to see, I'm pretty sure in fact that accrued vacation time is supposed to be forfeit upon termination/resignation per policy. I am certain they wouldn't have been willing to break their own rules for me that way had I not been as flexible as I have been. ",

You earned it, after all. If you had taken a week right now you'd be paid for it, so letting you have the value when you leave is fair. Not all places do that but it's a good sign that they do.",

There are exceptions to this rule. If your employer is short staffed or you are exceptionally proficient at a rather technical task, they may opt to keep you on for that two weeks'. Additionally, you rarely suffer from immediate termination and are generally eligible for rehire simply because you went to the trouble of turning in your time. Again, this isn't guaranteed but is a good rule of thumb. As you stated, you should always \"read the room\" before resigning to determine the best course of action. For example, my current situation: I will be straight up walking out the day before I start my new job with no notice given. My employer has dicked myself and multiple other employees around on several issues, pay being the big one. We've made our case but it's a matter of \"not my problem\" mentality so I have no issue with leaving them in the lurch and not being eligible to come back so long as it benefits someone else down the road. For the record, I'm NOT the only person doing this and to my understanding, they will be losing a significant number of key players over the course of a month.",

I've heard tale this isn't always true at higher end places but I have no first hand knowledge. Typically there's a tool room for more expensive/specialty tools but techs are generally expected to have all the tools they'll need to start the job. There are various \"grace periods\" to this rule, depending on your skill level and years of experience. A brand new lube tech can get away with minimal tools for a month or so, a \"c tech\" will be expected to have all the basics upon hire, and a line tech shouldn't need to borrow anything, ever. Another rule of thumb: if you have to borrow it 3 times, buy it.",

Seems like it'd be more efficient for the employers to just buy the tools themselves.  That way they don't have to pay for 20 techs to buy an expensive tool that'll get used once every week or two, they can just buy a few of them and everyone can share.  Or is it that there's effectively no way to prevent tools from disappearing?",

This means that each individual tech could possibly need to use the exact same tool at the exact same time. It's just not fiscally feasible for a shop to provide one of every tool to every bay, especially when you consider the initial investment of lifts, air, alignment racks, balancers, tire machines, flush machines, specialty tools, and so on. So techs are expected to provide their own tools. Also, yes. Theft is an issue in the industry. Often it's not malicious, a simple case of \"I have one just like it\" but it is common enough that most senior techs have engraved their shit.",

Some other people were upset but in the end I did what was right for me, the company was doing the same thing to all it's employees. \n\nEDIT: Also when you get offered a new job ask them when is the earliest you can start and notify them you are going to put your 2 week notice in to your current company but add that if the company cut ties when you notify them you can start earlier.  I did that at one job I had where they wanted me to start right away but said I would put my 2 weeks in and if things changed I would let them know.  the day after I notified the current company I was working for they wanted me to leave that day, lucky I had the other job I could start at earlier.",

The review was mostly the owner saying, \"See where it says you will be fired for this, you will be fired. Go to page x and do you see where it says you will be fired for this, you will be fired.\" My work week was Sunday through Thur. and when I found out that I was offered another job on Fri. afternoon at about 4:00 I called the office and told them I would not be coming back. If a company treats you poorly or has a reputation of termination when people give notice then I see no reason to give them any consideration. If there is a risk of getting fired when giving notice let your new employer know and see if they would let you start earlier than planned. ",

It's not unusual to see several people in one year rotating between different companies, either. Burning a bridge at one place under one manager by quitting and not giving notice could mean that you end up working for that same person one day, and get dropped from that payroll just as quickly as you dropped them the first time around.\n\nAt my previous company, it was well-known that if you were going to a competitor and turned in a written two week notice, they would walk you out the door immediately, but pay you for those two weeks. While you are correct, it is not a federal law to do that, many places will. If, however, you were going to a different sector of the industry, or someone they don't consider an actual decent competitor, they might have you work out your two weeks. \n\n",

They threatened to put a hold on my last pay check that they just gave out that day but didn't realize that I had already cashed it at their bank and put the money into my own account already so I laughed and walked out.  Then this very thing happened two other times to me.  I finally got a job as a contractor for the government and haven't looked back at the BS IT industry here in Vancouver BC. Apparently it hasn't got any better either.",

I recruit for a fairly large law firm that tends to hire from smaller firms in the area, and have seen and heard of all sorts of wacky scenarios with regards to giving notice. What I tell all of our new hires is this: we're happy to have you start in 2 weeks' so that you can give proper notice to your firm / company. However, if for some reason they let you go sooner than you expect, just get back in touch with me ASAP so we can make arrangements for an earlier start date. Or enjoy the extra time off!\n\nFor anyone in this situation, I'd suggest that rather than defaulting to giving your employer a day's notice just because you've seen them give people the boot before, just give your new employer a heads-up that your company tends to do this, and say something like, \"I'd like to give 2 weeks' notice so let's plan on X start date, but in the event they let me go sooner, may I get back in touch with you to make arrangements for an earlier start date?\" \n\nI've had candidates tell me that their company ALWAYS does this, and then lo-and-behold, their company ends up begging them to stay for as long as possible or coming back with a counter offer (because they're a strong employee, i.e. the reason we're hiring them).

Their default response is to tell you to just leave now whether your position is covered or not.  As a result, surprise!  Nobody here gives their 2 weeks anymore, they literally just stop showing up.  And after about a week or so of no-call no-shows, it dawns of them that this person has just quit.

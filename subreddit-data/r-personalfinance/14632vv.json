    "postText": "Hey Reddit, I\u2019m coming here to seek some advice on my personal finances.\n\nFor some context, I (29F, not married no children) come from Europe and moved to NYC 1 year ago. I make a great salary here ($8200 net per month), despite that I am really bad with budgeting and have no emergency savings and only debt. I didn\u2019t open a 401k either. One good thing is that I don\u2019t have a high credit limit (only $400) and spend all on debit.\n\nTo be fair - there are some things in my situation that slightly hinder my ability to save:\n\n1- in Europe, I own an apartment and have a mortgage which costs me $1500 per month. I spent all my savings 1 year ago for the down payment. My parents are currently living in this apartment. The deal was for them to pay me $1100 rent (that\u2019s the market value) but they have no income currently so have been living for free over the past few months.\n\n2- I have some debt that I incurred during Covid, I took out the loan to also help my parents. The debt repayment is 230$ per month which is reasonable. \n\n3- in addition to giving my parents free rent, they ask me for $600 additional per month to help cover living expenses. my sister who lives in London and makes a good salary also gives them money.\n\nCurrent I live with a roommate and pay $1850 rent in Brooklyn and have around $250 bills (internet, electricity, phone etc). \n\nBasically my fixed costs amount to more than half my salary (around $4400).\n\nThat theoretically leaves me plenty to spend and save. Last month I prepared a budget that should allow me to fully enjoy the NYC lifestyle and travel:\n\n- $1000 food and drinks\n- $700 travel ($8400 yearly - please note that as my friends, family and long term boyfriend live in Europe, I travel every 2/3 months to see them which is expensive. This also includes budget for occasional weekends and one 2 week vacation per year).\n- $250 groceries (I shop at Food bazaar, never go to Whole Foods or places like that)\n- $150 transportation\n- $100 shopping\n- $350 gym membership - I KNOW I\u2019ll get hate on this, this was a mistake. I\u2019m committed on 12 months and regret having this, I\u2019m ending it in September\n- $50 subscriptions (Hulu Netflix etc)\nTotal variable costs = $2200\n\nIf my math is right, this should leave me $1200 per month. Once I get rid of my expensive gym membership that should increase to $1550. Also, I want to start contributing to my 401k but I want to prioritize emergency savings first. \n\nOne upside is that my parents should start getting income in 2/3 months. They\u2019re starting a business which needs time to get up and running so hopefully they will be able to live without my help and pay me rent again, which could add $1000 to $1600 to my savings amount. but i have no certainty about this.\n\nDespite this I stress about money all the time. I'm scared that I\u2019ll have to help my parents all my life and that all my savings will go to them. At the same time, to be honest I don\u2019t want to sacrifice too much my lifestyle to save more. I'm making a good salary, work hard and feel like i \"deserve\" to enjoy these things. Like why should i stay home all the time, not go out with my friends, not travel to Europe spend time with my boyfriend\u2026\n\nalso, i'm stuck in a way that i cannot financially go back to europe right now. my salary would be halved and theres no way i could help my parents + pay my mortgage + save with 4000 euros. \nim on a work visa here so am\nnot legally  allowed to have more than 1 job nor change jobs. there will come a day that i'll have to leave, because my work visa will expire and i will probably want to settle with my boyfriend in Europe.\n\ni'm ready to hear everyone's thoughts and opinions on this situation! Any advice on the way I manage things is appreciated.\nalso if there are people here that have to help their parents too, how do you deal  with this?\n\nDisclaimer: I apologize in advance for talking about my \u201crich girl problems\u201d and hope I don\u2019t offend anyone. I know that hearing someone have a mortgage, no credit card debt and a good salary complain about helping her parents and not saving much is not at all relatable. I\u2019m really sorry but I just need to vent and hope I\u2019ll get some realistic feedback",

If it doesn\u2019t work out, never agree to that again (which I know is difficult).  \n  \nBesides that and the trips, it looks like you are doing well (besides the retirement, but I don\u2019t know how that works for non-citizens and for ones moving back). For your trips, I\u2019d look into a credit card with travel points as well as using deal websites (like skiplagged) to keep those costs down as much as possible.",

Even in the US that was a pretty standard arrangement before WWII and the state of Pennsylvania still has filial responsibility laws on the books that are enforced - legally requiring adult children to pay to support their parents if the parents can support themselves. So while it may sound bunkers to both of us, it\u2019s not a uncommon arrangement by any means.",

I wish it weren\u2019t the case and that they had prepared for retirement better but they had a lot of bad luck recently (no revenue for 2 years during covid) and also made bad choices twenty years ago that impacted their whole lives. I won\u2019t get into the detail of what happened, I think a lot of this could\u2019ve been prevented if they had lived below their means, but unfortunately that\u2019s not what happened :(",

            "comment": "This is a relationship and boundaries issue way more than a personal finance issue. The key to dealing with this is to figure out what your boundaries and limits with your parents are and stick to them, not to try to figure out how to arrange your finances so that you can always give them what they want no matter whether they're following through on their end of things or not. I don't know your parents, but there are plenty who feel that their children \"owe\" them financially and you will never be able to out-earn or out-save that because they will just feel entitled to more. Again, I'm not saying that your parents are like that, but I'm saying that I've run into that many times and you should consider whether this sounds familiar and make sure that you're establishing patterns that aren't going to result in you making this same post 10 years from now.\n\nAnd regarding their \"business\" plans: I don't know how much you know about the actual plans, but if someone without an income is taking money from their children in their late 50s or early 60s, that's a red flag to me that whatever \"business\" they're starting is more likely to be a get-rich-quick scam than a legit business that they'll be building up for long-term success.",

Do not invest any more money, covering their rent is plenty.  Sounds like they might need to get a job, even just part time to make sure that they can support themselves. \n\nI have a real problem with parents who have had all their lives to figure out their future and did nothing and then have no problem taking money from their children. That's a big problem for me. Please stop enabling this behavior. Get yourself a budget, start allocating your funds appropriately, and then maybe you can help them later (on your terms) when you have an adequately funded savings account and you've started saving for retirement. \n\nGood luck, OP. Jobs (and financial security) come and go. Don't let this opportunity to save slip through your fingers.",

And right now you and your sister are investing in this company.\n\nYour parents are freeloading off of you, and it's up to you how much of that you can put up with.\n\nOne solution I would explore is have your parents form some sort of corporate entity and you and your sister split 51% ownership of this entity based on what you have invested so far (including lost rent).\n\nAlso, making $8k/mo in NYC, spending $2k/mo or more on a small business investment may not be the smartest thing for you to be doing.  So maybe tell your parents to:\n\n* Get jobs\n* Pay rent\n* Do their small business as a side hustle",

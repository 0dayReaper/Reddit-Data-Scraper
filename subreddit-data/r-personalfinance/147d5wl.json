    "postText": "Please refrain from judging me, I am coming out of a long depression and am very embarrassed about this whole situation. Long story short, I had a traumatic experience in 2018 and ultimately relocated with my wife and young son to New York City to be closer to family. \n\nIn the time since we moved, I have gotten back in my feet and have been the sole income earner in a W2 job, so taxes have been withheld, but I have not filed a return since starting this new job in 2019. I still own the home in my previous city (different state) and have been renting it out to a long term tenant. \n\nI really just need advice on how to best go about actually filing\u2026 I used to do simple TurboTax but it\u2019s been so long that I feel like it\u2019s probably better for me to just hire someone to do it, right? How do you find someone that isn\u2019t HR Block or some other big brand that advertises on TV? Am I completely fucked?",

If you do owe, there will be fees, but things can be worked out. I\u2019ve been there. It\u2019s rough. Getting a professional to help did wonders for me. Good luck!",

Search for \u201chow do I file back taxes using Turbo tax\u201d. Good luck.",

    "postText": "My aunt received a credit card bill for $3 - a purchase she did not make, in another state,  on a card she hasn't used in well over a year.  She immediately disputed the charge. This occurred in Jan/Feb. The credit card company initially denied her fraud claim but she appealed it. No offical response received since. The credit card company has been reporting her late to the credit bureaus and has added on an additional $100 in late fees, finance charges, and penalties. \n\nShouldn't credit reporting be suppressed during the open dispute?  She just spoke to them again and they acknowledge they received her 2nd dispute in April... yet they are still reporting her late. Other than letting the dispute play out, what other recourse does she have?  She filed a CFPB complaint a couple weeks ago but the credit card company says they will respond in 60 days. On the phone just now they also suggested she pay the balance while they investigate (she is not, because she found info online suggesting that any fraud claim might be rendered invalid if she pays the charges).",

What's strange is that they did refund her a $229 charge made in Texas (it was not reflected on the bill she received, so she didn't even know about it until the subsequent bill came in). But the $3 charge in California was never credited. They started adding late fees in February. The first negative credit reporting was April 5th.",

She also told them to close the card.  They did close the card.  While she does not remember the date she called them, she told me that nothing ever came from her January call, other than the account being closed. She never received a letter about their decision.\n\nMarch she decided to officially dispute with a letter. They sent her a letter dated April 13th. That letter says they will investigate and render a decision in 90 days. \n\nShe recently noticed the negative credit reporting so she filed a CFPB complaint roughly June 1st.  The negative credit reporting took place as recently as June 5th.  She believes the 1st negative report was March 5th.  She called the credit card company today and was told they have no record of a January dispute (yet they closed her card IN January plus they automatically reversed that Texas charge of $229 that my aunt never even knew about, as if the account were on a fraud alert). \n\nCc company is Comenity, fyi.",

    "postText": "I got a call out of the blue a little over a month ago from a debt collection agency, saying I owed almost $1500 from an ambulance ride I took because of me being involved in a car accident OVER 2 YEARS AGO.\n\nWhile on the phone with the debt collector, I looked up debt collection laws, and after a couple minutes of research decided to request a Debt Validation Letter, which they are legally required to send me within 5 days of initial contact. \n\nLong story short, never received it. Instead they sent me a \"Verification of Balance\" letter. Which immediately told me \"holy shit, they don't have proof I owe the debt. Which means I'm not legally required to pay this shit.\"\n\nToday, right before the 30 day cutoff, I receive another call from them attempting to collect the debt. I request to speak with a supervisor. After going back and forth with him for a few minutes about why they haven't sent me a Debt Validation Letter (WHICH THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO UNDER THE LAW), he transfers me to his supervisor. \n\nThis is where it gets fun. I'm now going back and forth with him. After a few minutes he puts me on hold. Roughly 3 minutes later he comes back on and says \"Sir, after reviewing your file, it doesn't appear we have the documentation required, pertaining to the original bill, in order to send you a Debt Validation Letter. However I am showing you have a balance owed here in your file of $1,410.54. Would you like to pay a portion of it now, set up a payment plan, or...?\"\n\nHoly fuck. \n\nThis dumbass just admitted to me they don't have proof of me owing the debt. Which means im not legally required to pay it. It's null and void. \n\nI tell him this, he gets flustered, and after some more back and forth, basically tells me to have a nice day and hangs up the phone.\n\nI'm going to still send a letter requesting a copy of the debt validation letter via certified mail with a return receipt requested, to cover my ass. And when they don't, because they aren't able to, it's a done deal. \n\nIf they try to put it on my credit report, I just contact the credit agencies with proof of me asking for the debt validation letter and never receiving it, and it gets removed from my credit report. \n\nMoral of the story, ALWAYS ask for documentation. Don't let debt collectors scaring you into paying a Debt you may not be required to pay.\n\nHere's the bogus ass letter I received. http://imgur.com/yG9uDzH\n\nEDIT: This seems to be a pretty common question, so I'm editing it into the main body of my post. I'm being asked if I actually even rode in an ambulance and if I did I should just pay it.\n\nI was involved in an auto accident because some girl ran a red light and tboned me going 50m.p.h., and I had to take 2 ambulance rides because of it. \n\nI contacted my attorney and he sent me an itemized list of all debtors paid after the settlement which was finished 2 years ago. \n\nThere was a couple ambulance companies listed on there, but the amounts did not match the $1410 This debt collector was claiming. And without an account number, or any sort of identifying info, I was unable to match it to either of the paid ambulance bills in the documentation I received from my attorney. \n\nThus me attempting to clarify this with the debt collector, via a Debt validation letter.",

Yes, requesting validation is a generally a good idea, but just calling them up is definitely not the safest approach. It is very easy to accidentally say something that is not in your best interest over the phone.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections\n",

Let them know they are calling a place of employment and your company records all your calls. So you're telling them for the last time, this is not soandsos number. Do not call it again. If you do, I have proof you are harassing me. \n\nOr don't!

Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section:\n\n(5) Causing a telephone to ring or engaging any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number.",

They wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t say what it was for, eventually they say they will send something.  \n\nWe never received anything from them but one day my wife calls me crying(again very conscientious of her 800+ score) because she lost a few hundred points and was super mad at me for not just paying the bill blind.

I didn't recognize the creditor.  So I called up a lawyer I knew from before and asked him about it.  He asked me a couple times if I remember signing anything with this creditor and every time he asked I said I'm sure I didn't sign anything.\n\nSo he drafted up a letter and sent it to them asking for a copy of the agreement that I signed with my signature on it.  \n\nCouple weeks passed and then I get another certified letter in the mail stating the court case was dismissed with prejudice.  Looks like they didn't have anything with my signature on it.  I knew my ex forged my signature on a few things which she told me about so I was ready to tell them I didn't sign it and my ex forged it but they couldn't even produce that so the case was dropped and that was it.\n\nI did a records search in my county for my name and saw the court case.  Looks like they paid $105 just to file it in court.  So they are out of $105 trying to get me with something that wasn't mine.\n",

I ask what is this in regards too, he says he  cant say unless I verify my full name, dob and social.  I laugh and say no, tell me whose the biller \"ma'am we work with many dr offices it's hard to say\" so I said ok, list some \"I cant\" then go ahead and send me a bill and we'll go from there \"ma'am I cant I dont have your information \" \n\n3 weeks later I get a bill from the hospital for $50 due on an 11k charge.  Call.my insurance, verify that's correct they agree and I say cool I'll pay it\n. Few days later I get a call back from the above company, still says I owe 11k , still wont give me any info. \n\nIdk if they were a scam or what but you cant just call someone and say I need your info before I tell you why we're calling ",

Pretty much everything was up to snuff, except this one random hit to my credit from Verizon for $200+. \n\nThat amount wasn't news to me, it was the amount I used to be billed for my mobile plan. What was news was that this bill was for my last month of service even though I had paid them for that last month of service before I switched carriers... Over 18 months since then! \n\nBack then I was mailing checks (stupid) and I had no proof that Verizon had received the check. The check had been cashed though - I was able to see that much on my bank statement - but my bank also didn't have photo proofing as a feature yet for their online service. It had been so long that I also couldn't find the check book with the carbon copy. \n\nI contacted Verizon to get confirmation that I had paid this last month's plan fee, but they said they couldn't look up the account because they had sold the debt to a CA. Great...\n\nSo I finally get a call from the CA and I request the Validation letter. They send it, and I get a little freaked out that I only have 30 days to successfully dispute this debt, otherwise I'm going to owe another $200+. \n\nI send them the bank statement. They say that can't be counted as proof because even though the amount is the same, there's no info listed with the check. \n\nI check with my bank (small credit union), they say they're not able to bring up a photocopy of the check to corroborate. \n\nAfter a couple frustrating weeks, I finally found the one freaking box in the basement that housed this god damned check book. There it is! Check 105 to Verizon for the $200+. I mail that with my bank statement showing it was cashed to the CA. \n\nBoom. Debt cleared. Super frustrating experience, but it did help me learn a lot about how to keep and maintain records which has been a huge help in my personal finance journey. \n\nNever trust someone else to do the work for you.

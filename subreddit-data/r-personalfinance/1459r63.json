    "postText": "Will try to keep this brief. I work for a private company. My employment status is non-exempt, meaning I am paid 1.5x wages for overtime. I am effectively an hourly employee with benefits (who must work 40 hours a week). Company only pays overtime for hours *worked* over 40 hours. Meaning, if there is a holiday on a Monday, I still would need to work 40+ hours in the remaining days of the week to hit my OT rate. \n\nThe company insists they *have* to do this comply with FSLA. Seems like a bogus interpretation of the FSLA but whatever. This is my true issue:\n\nPay cycle is bi-weekly. Week before memorial day, I work 42 hours. The following week, I take my Memorial Day holiday, which is company sponsored paid leave. I go on to work 42 hours throughout the remainder of that week due to client demands. These hours end up spanning into my Saturday, taking up a lot of the day. This totals to:\n\n\\- 42 hours worked in week 1\n\n\\- 42 hours worked in week 2\n\n\\- 8 hours of holiday pay in week 2\n\n\\- Total: 92 hours\n\nThe firm categorizes the time and outputs the following on my paycheck:\n\n\\- 72 hours of regular pay\n\n\\- 4 hours of overtime pay\n\n\\- 8 hours of holiday pay\n\n\\- Total: 84 hours\n\nIs this normal? Shitty company policy? Legal? I've already pressed HR about this and they keep running me in circles. So tired of having to fight tooth and nail for what I think is my deserved comp.",

OT is over 40 hours *worked* per week, not 40 hours of time paid. Unless you live in California, which has its own set of rules (namely, more than 8 hours per day). So if you work 32 hours T-F and get paid 8 hours holiday pay for Monday, you'd need to work at least 8 hours on Saturday (assuming a typical Sunday-Saturday work week) before you start accruing OT.",

The payroll week doesn't have to coincide with the schedule.  Per FLSA, it has to be 7 consecutive days, and hours can't be averaged over a longer time period.  The biweekly pay is irrelevant to FLSA calculations, the company can use any pay interval.\n\nGiven what you posted, I see it like this:\nWeek 1: 40 hours straight pay, 2 hours OT.\n\nWeek 2: 40 hours straight pay, 2 hours OT, 8 hours holiday.  \n\nSo your check should be: 80 hours straight pay, 4 hours OT, 8 hours holiday.  So you are short 8 hours straight.  Find out the actual days of the week used for FLSA wages to check this.",

Many people don't understand this, whoever handles this at your company should and should be able to explain it clearly and show you on a calendar how it all works out.\n\nI can spin scenarios all day.  One thing that could have happened is that your payroll person rushed the processing because of the holiday week and turned it in before the pay period actually ended.",

Try explaining it this way.\n\nFirst, download a calendar page of May 2023 and June  2023.  Mark on the calendar pages when the pay period starts and ends for the pay period that includes the holiday.  Mark on the calendar the hours worked every day in that pay period.  Mark on the calendar the 8 hours holiday pay.  Mark 0 on the days you didn't work.  Does this match what you described?  Then show them the math.\n\nSee, they are right about some of this.  If a holiday happens on a work day, and you stay home that day and receive holiday pay, you don't get paid straight time.  That would mean you are paid 8 hours less straight pay than what would be your usual total.  But you aren't shorted because you get 8 hours holiday pay. \nWhere they screwed up is you worked an additional 8 more hours somewhere and they didn't add that in.  They are allowed to not pay OT until you have actually worked 40 hours.  Unless you have a contract that says otherwise.",

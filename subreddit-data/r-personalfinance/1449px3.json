    "postText": "Hi all,\nI had been saving money in a Roth for a down payment on a home. You can early withdraw no penalty and no tax in that case as a first time home buyer.\n\nHowever, rates went vertical, and buying a home isn\u2019t nearly as appetizing as it was. However, I have student loans which will \u201cturn back on\u201d in September. I read online that I can withdraw my contributions (just what I put in, not what I\u2019ve earned), from my Roth at any point. \n\n1/ can I withdraw those contributions no tax / no penalty?\n2/ my loans are at 7% so it seems silly to not take them down with the 10k I have contributed, what do you think? \n3/ thanks.\n\nEdit: additional context. 35-40 years til retirement. Outside of my Roth, i have 16% of my yearly salary going to a 401k as well.",

            "comment": "1) Yes, you can withdraw contributions, if earnings are withdrawn there will be a 10% penalty unless you fall into one of the few exceptions (one of which is $10k for first time homebuyers) 2) maybe, will you be unable to make the monthly payments without withdrawing from the Roth? It\u2019s hard to get money into Roth accounts and it\u2019s the most valuable asset class so I would use all other available funds (outside an emergency account) to cover the loans before withdrawing from a Roth, yes you would be \u201clocking in 7% return\u201d but growth from the Roth over your lifetime would take a significant hit by withdrawing from it early \n\nJust my thoughts!",

            "comment": "You can, but probably shouldn't.  Money in a Roth account is some of the most valuable money you can have.  You will never have to pay taxes on the growth if you use it for retirement.  I'm guessing from this post that you have several decades before retirement.  That $10k that you have in your Roth IRA will likely turn into $70,000 by retirement.  If you take the money out of your Roth not only do you lose that growth, but even if you manage to reinvest that money from future earnings, you can never get back previous years worth of IRA space.  So it will be in a taxable account where you will have to pay taxes on the $60k growth.\n\n7% isn't so high that I'd take the money out.  If this was a credit card debt with 20%+ interest, that would be a different story.  You are likely to earn 7% on your money if you invest it.",

            "comment": "You should use a Roth Individual Retirement Account for what it is designed to do, which is to invest money for your retirement. The ability to withdraw contributions without penalty is a nice feature but it should be used for financial emergencies where your other options are bankruptcy or homelessness. Saving for a down payment or to pay off a student loan should be done in a savings account.\n\nThat $10k in your Roth may seem small now and retirement may seem far away. But it's going to stay small and retirement will stay far away if you just withdraw your contributions whenever you want some extra cash. You will be better off long term leaving the money there and paying your bills from your income even if that means paying interest in your debt for awhile.",

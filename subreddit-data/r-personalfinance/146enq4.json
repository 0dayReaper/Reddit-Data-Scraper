Do any of them have multiple boxes checked?  it is interesting that reading the full brief description, it does not indicate any focus on either small, mid or large.  Rather, specifies that it has the three main market sizes and stresses diversity.\n\n\n*Created in 1992, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is designed to provide investors with exposure to the entire U.S. equity market, including small-, mid-, and large-cap growth and value stocks. The fund\u2019s key attributes are its low costs, broad diversification, and the potential for tax efficiency. Investors looking for a low-cost way to gain broad exposure to the U.S. stock market who are willing to accept the volatility that comes with stock market investing may wish to consider this fund as either a core equity holding or your only domestic stock fund.*",

That method of display is just a visual representation of the proportional dominance of large cap making up most of the fund.\n\nThere are many ways to represent this with this style.\n\n* https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vtsax/portfolio\n* https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Approximating_total_stock_market",

It's interesting how the \"Ownership Zone\" juuuuuust barely touches the Small cap.  You wouldn't know it to read the description.\n\nThank you for clarifying",

            "comment": "VTSAX holds basically every US stock in proportion to its market capitalization. Large cap companies (&gt;$10bn) make up the overwhelming majority (I think 70-80%+) of the total US market cap. As a result, VTSAX is predominantly made up of large cap companies - you'll see that the median market cap for VTSAX is $125bn.",

Shares and Stocks: eg. vanguard ETF\n3. Alternative Approaches: Are there other investment opportunities or unconventional paths worth exploring for short-term wealth growth? Any creative suggestions beyond traditional savings and shares?\n\nAcknowledging that most investments typically focus on the long haul, I\u2019m interested to hear your insights and experiences on approaches for shorter term goals.",

Perhaps keeping it in HYSA is my best bet until I reach my short term goals. \n\nI also have recurring investments in ETS\u2019 and salary sacrifice into retirement fund for the long term.

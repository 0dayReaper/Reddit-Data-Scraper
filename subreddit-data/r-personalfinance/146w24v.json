    "postText": "Question about tax savings:\n\n1. My wife has a HDHP through her employer. Her employer covers most of the deductible.\n2. We opened, in her name, a Fidelity HSA and are currently maxing it out ($7750 for a family) with post-tax dollars, then claiming it on our taxes as to not pay state and federal tax on the contributions. \n\nIf her employer had the direct deposit information for the Fidelity HSA, and moved it there through payroll deduction, do we also get a tax savings on FICA? Or, is it that the FICA savings is only through the employer's choice of HSA, but not one we voluntarily opened on our own?",

Which is why I was wondering if I should have her employer do it for us moving forward, to avoid FICA on the contribution. \n\nWhen you say 'depends', is that based upon some federal tax regulation or a 'depends' is a 'Sally in payroll likes my wife and codes it one way, and when Bob covers her for vacation, he codes it another way' type of thing?",

They can confidently code the transfers into this account under the Cafeteria Plan rules to be exempt from FICA/federal/state/local taxes.\n\nBut if she tells the company an account number, she will need to convince the company that it is indeed a HSA account to be coded as Cafeteria Plan deduction, instead of just another direct deposit destination (like a regular bank account).",

All the money will be post-FICA even though a portion of my paycheck was DD to my HSA.\n\nMost employers are not set up to accept HSA account information that you have set up outside the employer.

If so, you have an issue because the employer contributions count towards that max.\n\nMy spouse's employer uses Optum. It was a nightmare when my debit account got hacked. It was then that we learned that is just their preferred provider and he could have his HSA wherever we wanted. They deduct it pre-tax, but they also do not contribute any funds into it. Another option is that she could use the employer preferred provider and roll the money out to Fidelity.",

    "postText": "I'm a teenager, soon to start my first job. I would genuinely like to follow the 50-30-20 rule, and I think it's totally right, but my natural tendency is to kind of overcomplicate things.  I feel like dividing my savings into different categories (emergency fund, gift fund, personal projects, honeymoon, etc) with different savings accounts, but I think it may just be better to consolidate all but a few into one. \n\nBut what's especially difficult is handling \"crazy goals\", or someday/maybe goals. Right now, I've had my mind on the idea of athletics training, specifically with the idea of running an ultramarathon someday (crazy part). Though I know it will come with a fair investment. I don't want to just toss money towards each crazy goal I have, but I also want to have enough budgeting/saving competence that spending money in itself doesn't drive me away from expanding my horizons or doing new things. \n\nAll advice is much appreciated!",

Assign a portion of that to your \"try new things\" category each month, and put whatever isn't used into either checking or a savings account for months when the 'try new thing' is a tiny bit more expensive than you expect.",

Keeping my recurring expenses as low as possible, allows me to build up.  \n\nWhen the moment comes to spend on something crazy, I make that decision vs. what I have built up,  considering if it increases my expenses,  or would leave me short should I lose income.    Then I weigh that vs. whatever it is I'm spending on.\n\nOn a spreadsheet I have those buckets, but I found maintaining different actual accounts for different purposes to be overly cumbersome.  It all goes into one big one, and I use the spreadsheet to track and maybe think about priorities.\n\nI know a drink from a coffeeshop isn't going to get me to any goal.   It is those little day to day decisions that get you there, more than \"oh, my coffee account is  down to zero\"     Same with the car account, I know a fancy expensive car isn't going to get me there, the cheap car will allow me to go more places.  Or bigger nicer housing is going to be less comfortable because of constant anxiety about how to pay for it and never being able to have a coffee from a coffee shop.\n\nAs a young'un, you might be better to spend on things like an ultramarthon, esp. before you get responsibility, and might be able to move back home/live in a van down by the river that won't hurt your old bones that were damaged in ultra-marthoning in your youth.     Do all the crazy stuff you can while you can before your life gets ruled by others.",

    "postText": "So the short of it is I get a letter last Friday saying I owe interest and none of my payment has been received. Well I followed a link from the IRS website when I saw what I owed (1642 and change). I paid on Pay1040 via PayPal since I can pay it off over 6 months interest free as I had a lot of bills coming up. \n\nCall the IRS and the lady has no clue what pay1040 is. I inform her I paid and the money was charged to my account after following the link from their website. I ask her if it was filed under the wrong tax year perhaps and she says it is not. She really seemed absolutely clueless but that could be in part to the fact she really didn\u2019t have anything on her screen.\n\nSo I sent multiple emails to Pay1040 cause every customer service thing is automated now. No email replies after 3 times and this was spaced out over a week since it said it could take up to 24 hours to get back. So now I\u2019m freaking out because I\u2019ve been on hold with Pay1040 for 2 hours and 53 minutes and am yet to speak to anyone. I have my confirmation number ready and I can look up the receipt on their site. These wait times paired with no one seeming to know what they\u2019re doing has been incredible. Another wasted Friday night at the hands of Uncle Sam",

You are freaking out prematurely over nothing.\n\nIs it possible you got the SSN/name/year wrong? Yes. Is it possible everything is fine? Yes. It's just too soon to tell, and customer support is only going to tell you what they see, not what the IRS sees. If you call the IRS, they won't be able to tell you much for about 2 weeks. They are literally printing out paper and carrying it downstairs for input to the mainframe once a week.\n\nSo, too soon. Go to irs.gov and check your transcript",

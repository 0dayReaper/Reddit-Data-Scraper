They are also increasing my escrow payment to backfill my escrow account as well.\n\nMy problem is that with only a month and  a half warning my overall mortgage payment is increasing my 46% (about $880). What are my options to have the escrow backfill portion negotiated down so I'm not seeing such a drastic increase? I'm an average Joe and 880 increase overnight is definitely felt.",

Even though the cost is paid through escrow you can and should be choosing your own insurance and making sure your rates are competitive. You may also be able to raise your deductible (within reason, your lender will have require minimum coverages limits and maximum deductibles).\n\n- Check your taxes directly with your county. Make sure you are getting any homeowners/homestead exemptions you qualify for.\n\n- Check the mortgage companies math for the escrow analysis. For \u201cbankers\u201d most lenders are notoriously bad at calculating escrow. If you if understand the charges and what these expenses are, you can plan for these even when the mortgage servicer messes up the math.",

If you've lived there for more than a couple years maybe it's just valuations and your state has no guardrails for homeowners.  In any case, it's probably hard to hear this but you should have had plenty of notice, either when you built, or bought, or when the assessor sent you notice of your assessed value, and your tax bill.  \n\nEscrow is only designed to protect the bank by making sure things get paid and there are no liens on the collateral for the loan.  It doesn't protect you from wild swings.\n\nYou do have some options.  Make sure you've filed your homestead exemption (if applicable).  If your assessor's valuation is out of line, appeal it.  Make sure the bank is paying the correct amount in taxes.  Shop for cheaper insurance.  You can pay a lump sum on the deficit but I ack this could be a challenge.  If your taxes are stable going forward then your payment should go down next year.  Pay attention to the mail from the assessor going forward so you have more time to plan.  If you can't afford the house going forward you can sell.",

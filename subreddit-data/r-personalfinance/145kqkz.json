I earn around \u00a325K a year.\n\nI could sell my current car for around \u00a32000. \n\nThe car I'm looking at is around \u00a315K. \n\nWhat should I do? Obviously I can't afford to put the whole 15K down and buy the car outright because that would mean I have no more savings?\n\nI could pay off 20% of the car with my own money then and then pay the rest with a bank loan spread over 4 years with 4.9% interest rate.\n\nI'm not sure. What would you guys recommend? \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Or keep your current car until you can afford $15k cash.",

If possible continue to use it.\n\nAt earnings of 25k/year I would not get a loan for the amount of the car.    \n\n\nyou need to continue saving for the car and get another job if you need to.   You may not want to but you should use your savings.   Keep about 2k for an EF.  do you have any other debt?",

FInd a mechanic you can trust to look it over and buy straight cash. \n\nEven with that really good interest rate you will pay more into the car than what it is worth. You spend 8k-10k you still have a nice savings to build on. With no pressure from mom and dad why dig a whole of debt you don't need?",

            "comment": "My wife and I bought two new cars we could easily pay cash for 2 years ago when we moved across the ocean to our new home. I plan on keeping both of these cars until I die or the cars die(I.e. engine and or transmission gives out). Prior to this my wife drove the Toyota her parents bought her when she was 16 and I drove the car I bought straight out of college. They were both close to 20 years old when we had to leave them behind. The cost of shipping them was more then they were worth. I also spent less then $2000 dollars maintaining those cars for the last 10 years I had them. I did all this because of YouTube. Purchase some good tools and proper safety equipment and you too can change out the busted drive shaft on a Toyota Corolla or multiple tie rods over the years (first one I did took me 6 hours; the last one I did took 30 mins). Unless your car\u2019s engine or transmission is shot, you can probably keep it running for a lot longer then you think possible. Invest your money wisely and stop spending it on something that will depreciate in value by 5% or more the minute you buy it.",

    "postText": "I have different passwords for every website I log into, 2-factor authentication when possible; I thought I knew all the scams and could spot them a mile away. This one still got me. \n\nI was meeting a friend at a bar. Two drinks in I got a call from someone identified by my phone as Wells Fargo. I'm fully aware this could be spoofed, but it did not raise alarm bells yet. I was at a bar I did not frequent and have gotten calls from my bank before on suspicious charges that were legit, so I answered expecting this to be the case.\n\nThe person I spoke with said they were with Wells Fargo and they've identified fraudulent charges on my account but they need to verify my identity before they can discuss details. They said they sent me a text message (via the cell number they just called, which is my first clue this is phishing). They asked me to read back to them the 6-digit number just texted to me to verify my ID. Being two drinks in, slightly expecting what this was about, I had zero alarm bells going off. My bad, this was stupid of me. I read the number to them. They suggested it timed out and I needed to read another number they texted to me. Minimal time had passed, a mild spidy sense was tingling, but I still was not concerned enough to ask questions and read them a second 6-digit code.\n\nThis person then read off 5 recent charges on my account, 4 of which I recognized as legit and a 5th that was a $1000 charge to a credit card I did not own. I immediately identified this as a fraudulent charge and they said \"no prob dude, we'll freeze your card and send you a new one\". They even gave me the last 4 on the card it was coming from. I was appeased enough to continue (sadly). \n\nFinally, they said they sent me one final 6-digit code to confirm that they were crediting my account back with the $1000 fraudulent charge. I just needed to read off the final code they texted to me. At this point things seem weird to me but they got me at a good time. I was 2 drinks in, was interrupted from hanging with a close friend I hadn't seen in months and was outside trying desperately to avoid the loud noise inside the bar but still dealing with traffic noise outside. I just wanted to be done with this. I read them the final code and they thanked me and hung up. \n\nAt this point, I see why my phone had been vibrating constantly through this call. I had 4 emails from Wells Fargo. 1) Your user name has been reset, 2) your password has been reset, 3) Welcome to Zelle! an awesome $$$ forwarding service, 4) You've just forwarded $1000!!!!!\n\nI called Wells Fargo via the number on the back of my card. After being on hold for 45 min trying to get the fraud department, I start to tell my story only to have the call drop (I'm pretty sure they hung up on me). I called back and was on hold for 1 hour 20 min (my account has been compromised &gt;2 hours by this time) to get a second person. He told me this was a scam they've been dealing with for 3 months and I needed to go into a branch with 2 forms of ID to deal with it. There was nothing he could do tonight.\n\nTDLR: Dude spoofed Wells Fargo when calling me on my cell, requested a reset of my user name, password and approval for $1000 transfer. I stupidly read off the confirmation numbers I received via text to him, he entered them into Wells Fargo website to approve all these requests. Wells Fargo has known their customers have been getting scammed for 3 months and didn't bother to warn anyone. I now have to go into a branch, hang my head and tell my shameful story to a person and beg for access to my account because someone else has control of it all night tonight.",

They said they can't prove who they are and suggested I call the number at the back of my card and ask to talk to the fraud department.\n\nIt was so tempting to just believe them because scammers wouldn't do that, right? But I hung up and I called my bank's known number. The call was legitimate, but I just _had_ to do it, it's just dumb to trust someone calling you and saying they're your bank.",

Which is separate from the confirmation codes that can only be entered after logging into the website. In fact that makes me question Wells Fargo even more. Why was the scammers even able to get to the web portal for entering that specific users confirmation codes without that specific users login credentials? Maybe they were on another phone talking directly to the bank. But even then requiring only the confirmation code without any preexisting access code is just not reasonable because that makes a stolen phone the keys to your bank. ",

This should help you out:\n\nSimple rule of thumb, if you're initiating the call, you're usually okay.\n\nIf THEY are initiating the call, never, ever, ever give out any PII (personal identifying information). Ask them to give you a name and contact number, then check online if that contact number is legit (point about this, for any card holder companies use the # on the back of the card and be careful as attackers can try and get \"fake\" information to the top of google by exploiting the algorithms), then call back. The caller can try giving you the official legit number to try to keep you on the phone or build trust, don't let that sway you. Get off the phone asap and don't change the process if they call you back 10 days later just because they gave you the official number, you called the official number and everything was fine. Stay safe. If they get mad, they're scammers. If they try to keep you on the line, they're scammers. If they try to get you to alter your behaviour, they're scammers. \n\nNumbers can be spoofed to look like they're coming from somebody else, but it's very, very difficult for an attacker to reroute your call if you're the one initiating the call. They would need to hijack either your service provider or the bank's phone number... which is very, very hard to do and if they are able to... well, the bank and service provider have much bigger problems at that point.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit again: Since a couple of replies have pointed this out, another thing to look out for is scammers who register their number very similarly to the legit party. i.e. if your number is ###-###-1234 they might register ###-###-1324. Always verify what you punch into your phone and actually call. Obviously I can't cover every type of phishing scam out there or I'd be here for hours, but that one is one that warrants me editting in since my post seems to have reached a decent audience.",

The guy laughed when I said I didn't feel comfortable which made me even more sure it was a scam. \n\nI hung up and called amex and they confirmed it was a legit call.

Not only was this useful for staying in contact with the victim during an emergency call, but this is how tracing calls used to be implemented. \n\nIn the days of stepper exchanges (each digit would send between 1 and 10 pulses down the line, causing a series of mechanical stepper [to switch between lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZePwin92cI)), the method for tracing a call involved forcing the line open, then getting a technician out to each exchange along the route to see which position all the stepper switches were in.\n\nEven after the move to early electronic switching equipment, tracing would have still required the line to be held open.",

My card was declined, and within about a minute I got a phone call from Wells Fargo. The conversation went like\n\n\"We see there was a charge on your card for $35x.xx at [auto parts store]. Is this a fraudulent charge?\" \n\nAnd I told them no, they said thank you and that was the end of the conversation.",

I just checked the Wells Fargo site and you can't reset a password without knowing the username (or SSN). And you can't reset the username without knowing the password (or SSN). So some guys got hold of his social security number, phone number, the last 4 digits of his credit card, and they knew he had an account at Wells Fargo.

    "postText": "My husband and I met in high school and both went to college (basically) locally. When we were ready to buy a house, we could really only afford the area that we grew up in without wanting to be too far from the city. We are 15 minutes from my parents (the house I grew up in), and we have a one year old now.\n\nMy husband has always wanted to move out of state, and I've always been nervous to do so. But now, I'm feeling like I need to get out of here. We want to experience a new place, and force ourselves to meet new people and make home out of a new city. We are looking at Chattanooga - it would only be about 1.5 hrs from where we live now, so not a terrible distance from family still if we need help with the baby at times.\n\nWe are looking at likely being able to make about a $130k net profit (potentially 10-20k more) if we sell our current house. The house we are looking at is $650k, and would be about $4800 monthly. We make about $9500 between the two of us. On the high side of things, I think after all bills, living expenses, and daycare are paid for we would have about $1300 left each month. We would likely come out of pocket about $70k for downpayment/closing costs, and then we have about $14k I would like to pay off from a home repair we did earlier this year. Based on what we have now in savings (about $30k) and if we purchase a few things for the new house, it could leave us with about $60k total in savings. \n\nWe both work from home. We don't have car payments right now, but both of our cars are on the older side. We do plan to have more children soon, but I also plan/hope to continue earning more with my work (I own a business).\n\nDoes this make sense to do? Are we shooting too far outside of what we can afford? The interest rates are high now, and our lender said they are likely to lower in 3-5 years. We could wait, but I don't love the idea of spending that much longer in a place that I really don't enjoy anymore, but also don't want to make a rash decision if it is not financially sound.",

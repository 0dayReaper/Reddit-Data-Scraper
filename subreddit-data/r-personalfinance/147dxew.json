I\u2019m estimating bills like phones, electric, groceries, gas etc at about 4300 per month and we net about 9K per month. Obviously interest rates are high and so are home prices. I\u2019m looking at a minimum of about 2800 per month and a high of about 3300 for a mortgage (450k-500k at 6.8% interest)on a house in my area that meets our wants/needs. We are currently living with my wife\u2019s parents and trying to be patient with the market but it\u2019s not easy with two kids plus a wife that wants a house sooner than later. Is it financially irresponsible to buy a home at these rates? Is 1300-1800 per month enough of a safety net?",

    "postText": "I am very conscientious about my credit. I got it from low 400s to just hitting over 800 about 2 months ago in the last 9 years. I was recently promoted at work (top 10 in Fortune 500) and they would like me to get a corporate card to supply workers with necessities. I have no car payment and no mortgage. I was told that they would run my credit to acquire the card. I only worry about this because I know inquiries stay around for 2 years and act as a hit on your credit. I'm also looking to purchase a home in the next year. My company told me the card is optional and if I don't want my credit ran, I do not have to acquire the card. I want to help the company and take this new position by the horns but I don't want to screw myself down the road.",

Yes, they stay on the record for 2 years; but the impact to credit score is minimal.\n\n&gt; I'm also looking to purchase a home in the next year.\n\nIf you're more than 6 months out - the impact should be low. If you're within a 6 month window of applying for a mortgage, skip the credit card.",

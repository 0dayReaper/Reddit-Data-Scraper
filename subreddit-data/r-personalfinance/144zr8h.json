    "postText": "I've recently bought a car with 14k loaned. I put forward $1300 two weeks ago and noticed my balance didn't go down. The dealership said I would be able to make principle payments. I made sure to note \"put towards principle only\" so I called the company and they do not allow paying off principle or paying future payments, at least from what the call center person was saying. The $1300 I paid was to pay off only interest as it gets added on daily and if I overpay they will keep the balance. \nMy question is does it make sense to pay interest early? Logically I don't see any benefit to it and plan to not pay more than the monthly payments from now on.",

Normally, when you manually pay but especially \u201coverpay\u201d your monthly, you have 3 options to choose from:\n\n1. Towards principal\n2. Towards bill and principal\n3. Towards bill and future bill \n\nDepending on how recent it is, I\u2019d probably refinance. Sounds like they\u2019re trying to bury you in interest.",

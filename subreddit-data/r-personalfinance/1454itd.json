    "postText": "Hi! 27f here. I come from a financially insecure family and have received no guidance on how to properly budget/save. I am seriously clueless on where most people are at at my age. I feel like I am in halfway decent shape, but there is surely tons of room for improvement.\n\n- No debt (paid off all 20k+ in student loans during peak pandemic while living at home and working remote - this was clutch)\n- No car payment (also no car though, I live in a walkable city and use public transport)\n- 25k emergency savings \n- currently $2300 in checking\n- owe $680 on credit cards (I pay in full each month, these will be paid off before they\u2019re due)\n- 40k across my fidelity accounts (401k, Roth, etc)\n- 65k salary (about $3250 take home each month)\n- monthly expenses including rent, transportation and food are right at $1200 (this will be increasing to $1600 in the fall when I move into my new apt though. This is what I\u2019m most nervous about)\n\nSo with that said\u2026 just sort of wondering where I\u2019m at compared to others my age and what I should be focusing on most to increase wealth. I am actively looking for new jobs more in the 80k range which should increase my take home right on par with my expenses increasing I believe. Just looking for general advice or commentary.",

I'm twice your age and don't have nearly as much emergency savings, although I am trying to build it back up after buying a car. You have no debt, pay your credit cards in full every month, and have a decent amount of money saved for retirement. You don't say how much you contribute; but waht I have always tried to do, is with each job change, salary increase, i up my contributions a percent or two, and currently am almost maxing out.\n\nI also make more than you do, but I've also been working longer.",

Your doing great and you can only  proceed at the pace your income allows. ask yourself why money is important to you and how you want to use it as a tool. Rather than accumulating more for the hell of it. Learn about your why. And follow the PF flowchart for cash optimization.",

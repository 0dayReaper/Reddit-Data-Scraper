    "postText": "I know the \u201cDebt Snowball Method\u201d says to pay off your smallest debt first then use the payments you were making on that debt to pay off the next highest one. Wondering if that\u2019s always the smart move.\n\nWe have two credit cards we would like to knock out. One is 26% interest and a $1700 balance and the other is 15% interest with a $5,000 balance and a $200 a month payment which I cannot stand. I inherited both through marriage, I\u2019m not big into credit cards, so this is a bit foreign to me. DR method says to handle the small one first but, in my mind, I\u2019m wondering if it doesn\u2019t make more sense to handle the high interest, high monthly payment one first.\n\nI would definitely appreciate any insight!\n\nCLARIFICATION: an eagle eyed Redditor said 2% sounded low\u2026and they were right: it was 26% interest, so I\u2019ve updated.\n\nBut the advice I\u2019ve received still seems to stand: kill the high interest first.",

Now I have this money coming in and really need to read about how to get caught up and how best to use it for the future. This is great sub!",

Versus grinding for years to pay off one large bill. If you do the math. The correct answer is to pay the high interest debt down first. But the majority of people in these situations need to feel motivated and rewarded. Otherwise they give up. If everyone was sensible and thought about things logically. They usually would of not piled on the debt in the first place. Sometimes things happen out of our control. But often debt is piled up by spending on things that are not really needed.",

As made up example numbers, say you have $3000 in savings, and $2000 in credit card debt, and let's say the interest in debt is $200 per month.\n\nThen let's say that unbeknownst to you there is an emergency that pops up 3 months later that costs $3,000 to deal with.\n\nIf you keep your savings, then when that emergency comes around, you would have spent $600 in interest, leaving you with $2400 in savings and $2000 in credit card debt.\n\nAfter paying for the emergency, you have $0 in savings and $2600 in credit card debt.\n\nGoing back in time, let's say you instead paid off the credit debt immediately using your savings. You would have $1000 left in savings, and $0 in credit card debt. Three months go by, that remains the same. Now the emergency comes up, you don't have nearly enough in savings, so you pay the remaining $1000 of your savings, and without any choice, put $2000 on your credit card.\n\nAfter the emergency, you have $0 in savings, and $2000 in credit card debt that will start accruing interest after a month.\n\nCompare that to if you kept your savings. Either way, you have $0 left in savings, but if you paid off the debt immediately, you are $2000 in debt with a month before interest kicks in. If you kept your savings, you are $2600 in debt, and you still need to pay that month's interest on the first $2,000, even if you might still have a month before you have to pay interest on the $600.\n\nPaying it off immediately saves a lot of money, money which can then go towards paying for the emergency instead of paying for interest, and in the end you have a much more manageable amount of debt to deal with.\n\nIf there never is any emergency, then paying it off first still works out better because instead of paying interest you can instead pay that money directly to your savings account, and probably have a much more relaxed time without debt and interest weighing over your head every day until it is paid off.",

For example financing a reasonably priced used car, to let you get the your job, get to more affordable grocery stores, and just generally live. David Ramsey is opposed to any debt, which ignores the reality that many/most people aren't in a position to realistically follow that advice.",

They are not mathematical. You seem to not have psychological issues with money. So the math method may work better for you. \n\nAlso you married into this debt. Dave does seem to have a lot of things to say about how to handle finances within a marriage. I can't say for certain, because I have never been married. But it certainly sounds good to me.",

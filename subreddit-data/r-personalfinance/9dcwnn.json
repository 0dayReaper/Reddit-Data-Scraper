    "postText": "I noticed a weird charge in my statement that pays my amazon store credit card off. It's listed as security 5. I didn't know what it was but the amount kept going up as my card balance went up. \n\nCalled the number and the guy answered then danced around what the name of the company was and what they were charging me for.  Eventually he slipped the word synchrony and that dinged in my head the bank that issues the amazon card. So i googled (all this while still trying to get this guy to tell me what this charge was for) and found that it's an automatic form of insurance that you are put on when you open the card. It's 1.66% of your balance monthly and you have to opt out by responding to a single piece of paper mail that gets sent sometime when you open the card. \n\nNow im getting frustrated that this guy isn't saying what the hell his company does when he just changes gear and says the full balance will be returned and the service stopped. \n\nIt was over 1800 dollars since 2014\n\nI'll have it back in 3 days i was told but check your statements people. \n\nEdit: even if you use the 0% for 12 months on large purchases (which is how i typically use my card) it still charges their fee every month\n\nedit2: i had to go to amazons chat this morning as it was still showing as being active. the representative was polite and disabled it immediately, saying the refund will come in a 1-3 weeks credited to my card.\n\nedit 3: I was credited back the money this morning. ~12 hours after chatting with support",

I believe there are other Synchrony cards that offer the same \"Card Security\" program. My understanding is that this is an \"opt-in\" program, but I have read stories of people accidentally signing up for the program when applying for the card.",

It starts shitting the bed randomly during prime time.  I play an MMO, I need a *stable* connection, not a fast one.  Last time I ran a tracert to my game and a continuous ping to their own DNS server, showing that it was definitely the local node that was dropping off every ten seconds and not any of the end point connections.  They sent out a line tech to fiddle with stuff and redo our final connection, but it happens multiple times a week.  I have to switch over to my frickin cell phone in order to have a no packet loss.

For example, If you pay $60 a month for internet speeds of 80 down 20 up. And they upgrade their services so that 80d/20up is now 120d/25up for $60, they will give you the better speeds at the price you are paying now because that is what they offer. What's shady is when they continue to charge you the same price even though their services have improved over time. So even though your bill hasn't changed, you could be getting better speeds for what you pay for. Or on the other hand, reduce your monthly bill by keeping your current speeds.\n\n&gt; It starts shitting the bed randomly during prime time.\n\nGood luck getting this issue fixed. I has a similar issue where I would get 10% of the service I pay for during peak hours. My cable company refused to accept the fault is on their end unless all other options have been eliminated.  Which resulted in a 6-8 month period of me testing my own equipment, constant calls to phone techs who said \"everything looked fine on their end\" But did notice a bit of congestion issues. Having 5 service techs come out who changed and replaced everything including the drop line into my apartment. 3 modem changes. Finally I got someone who was actually honest with me and said I needed to have a service call 3 times in a 2 month period in order for them to run the issue up the chain.  Once I did that they finally admitted the fault (which I knew and tried to explain several times) was with an overloaded node causing high congestion during peak hours. They don't ever want to admit this unless its the last resort because it costs them time/money on new equipment. ",

It turned out to be a fraudulent charge - a clothing company that I bought from a week prior had a data breach and didn\u2019t notify customers for a while.I immediately went online and disputed the charge and froze the card. The scammers tried to do a few more charges but they were declined and I got the $600 reversed after the investigation. But you really have to be proactive to avoid being a victim.",

First I recommend keeping a mental note of what you\u2019ve spent your money on with that card. Or even a physical note if you use it quite frequently. After that all you have to do is check your statement frequently (id say once a week is good) and look for any discrepancies. Check to see if any charges happened that shouldn\u2019t have. Get in the habit of knowing what should be taken out on a monthly basis and how much it is. You\u2019ll be surprised how many companies will charge you after you cancel a subscription. I\u2019ve had it happen with amazon, PlayStation, and Hulu off the top of my head. ",

I financed a small loan for a bed with them and throughout the entire length of the loan I would ask for my account information so that I could set up online payments. They\u2019d give me the run around and say that they have to send it in the mail. Time would go by and because I had no way to contact them or register online (needed account number, which they told me they\u2019d send every single month.) Well, it was 0% apr the first year but if you didn\u2019t pay it off in that year they go back and charge interest for the entire loan, and added a few hundred dollars for that reason. Then they called me because I was once again late on my payment (surprise, your system and customer service fucking suck.) I\u2019m usually timid and respectful because I know these people get yelled at all day, but I was fucking livid and went off. Sure enough they removed any \u201clate payment\u201d remarks from the account and let me pay the small balance remaining. I convinced them because I would pay 2-3x the minimum payment and asked \u201cevery single time you have called for a late payment, I have made more than the minimum. Do you think I have trouble paying my bills or do you just have terrible customer service?\u201d \n\nSorry for the wall of words but I loathe shady businesses like Synchrony Bank and the sooner people learn of their predatory practices, the sooner they will hopefully go out of business. \n\nBtw Chase has a good amazon program as far as rewards (but very high interest rates)",

                            "comment": "I used to work for a CC company that had a wide and varied line of cards they offered customers: cash back cards, travel cards, rewards cards, etc. Often times people would have multiples of this company's card. And this company was also the underwriter (terminology?) of cards that other companies would sell to other customers like store cards for &lt;insert big box store name here&gt;. The company on the back of those store cards was listed as something completely different than the company's name that I worked for....something innocuous and generic, but it was definitely this big CC company. \n\nThis company was so big and their portfolios so diverse that oft times customers would only have this company's credit cards in their purse or wallet believing they had multiple company's cards, which they didn't. \n\nThese cards would by default charge opt out \"credit protection\" fees that as far as I knew did nothing more for the customer than we already did for the customer. \n\nAll of these cards would have fairly high default interest rates except for their high end cards that always had the best rates. But the penalty rates (when you were late) on all of the cards were 25.99% when that was the legal limit. Now I think it's 29.99% if there is a limit anymore and I've no doubt that's the new penalty rates these days. IDK. I don't work there any more. \n\nBut I would notice that the instant a customer was late, even just once, that the interest rate would jump to 25.99%. If the customer had a wallet full of this company's cards he'd quickly find out that all of their interest rates jumped to 25.99%. The company would never ever budge on the rate so long as a balanced was carried and for a certain period of which I've forgotten. \n\nI've come to the conclusion that credit card companies dangling incentives to apply for and use their cards with these usury rates are doing nothing more than attempting to ensnare their customers and that their cards are little more than traps. \n\nAnd so I steer clear of these types of cards and companies and stick to my credit union's offerings which at least on their no-frills cards appear to be sane. \n\n\n\n",

I had a card from them before they decided to rebrand from GE Capital and they actively went out of their way to screw me over on multiple occasions. Outside of a random unnecessary charges that they would put onto my card, they also completely closed my account at one point while I was 300 miles from home because, as they claim, their servers got hacked. I didn't get notified until 2 weeks after when I was on vacation, and needed to get gas because I didn't have anymore cash on me. I literally had to call them to see why my card was declining before learning that it was closed and that's when they decided to send me a new one. Then, I had $5,000 worth of fraudulent charges put on to my card a year later after I had called them for the sole reason of closing my account. I stated the reason was that I not only had no use for the card anymore but also that I knew my ex had my credit card number and was going to make a shit ton of fraudulent transactions if I left that card number active.\n\n\nI had to go through fighting them for 3 months with a dozen different excuses as to why my card wasn't closed, when it was supposedly reactivated, who reactivated it, and so on. Not once did I get a straight answer, let alone an answer that even remotely reflected what another person told me. No joke, their fraud department told me after 3 months of trying to get information, that I need to \" suck it up and take responsibility for my actions\" as though it's my fault they decided to not close my account, tell me that it was close, and ignore the fact that I told them that one of the main reasons why I am closing the account is because of a fraud risk. This was all despite the fact that my ex had flat-out admitted to the police that she was the one who did it and that I'm not at fault. I literally had to sue Synchrony Bank just so I could get them to take their own advice and take responsibility.\n\n\nSynchrony is beyond unethical and they have no right being in business.",

It\u2019s famous because for the last decade people have been receiving endless tele-marketing calls offering to help them claim back the PPI they\u2019d been mis-sold.\n\nIn the 90s, as it was such a profitable product, UK financial institutions begun slipping PPI in under the radar in small print or with false promises of increased loan approval odds.\n\nIn the end, the practices were deemed underhanded and unfair to consumers and so over the last decade or so, they have had the right to claim it back.\n\nThe lenders ended up owing consumers billions.\n\nFrom the [Wikipedia entry on PPI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_protection_insurance):\n\n&gt;\tUK banks have set up multibillion-pound provisions to compensate customers who were mis-sold PPI; Lloyds Banking Group have set aside \u00a33.6bn,[17] HSBC have provisions of \u00a3745m,[18] and RBS have estimated they will compensate \u00a3950m.[19] Payment Protection Insurance has become the most complained about financial product ever.[20]\n\nSo, whilst the legality of the practice varies upon jurisdiction, the lender who attempts to sell the product \u2013 as in OPs case and 100,000s more in the UK \u2013 usually does so covertly.\n\nBecause of the way it is sold, it\u2019s a scam.",

In fact, I recently had to show a few of them how to do it and they had all been working there for over a year.  \n\nI get an email from my bank when I have a deposit over a certain amount and I noticed in that email, which was just my paycheck direct deposit, that it was about $5 more than normal.  I asked around to see if anyone knew what was up and people acted like I was a weirdo for even noticing it.\n\nI also was the first to notice that the employee I manage had been given an incorrect raise AND promotion on the internal system (PeopleSoft) where I can see their title and salary history. I was checking to see if management and HR/payroll had given them this promotion yet and lo and behold they got an extra $5k and an extra pay grade. Luckily the higher-ups noticed it a couple days later, before her 2nd incorrect paycheck went out, and told HR/payroll to fix it.  My employee actually had to take a deduction on the next paycheck to pay back the overpayment.  \n\nI find it pretty odd that my employee never questioned it, but I guess if you never look at your pay stub and you know you're getting a promotion, you might assume that the increase in your direct deposit is correct and not actually do the math.  Personally, I know exactly what my take-home pay would be with a 10% raise,  within a few pennies, but I also do spreadsheets for fun.",

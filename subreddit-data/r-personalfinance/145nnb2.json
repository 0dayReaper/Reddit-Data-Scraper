    "postText": "So my wife and I live in a home that was gifted to her by her parents. The home was built in the late 60\u2019s and is the home my wife and her family grew up in. The home is paid off therefore we have no mortgage and only pay property tax. At this point, we\u2019ve been living here about 3 1/2 years as a married couple and she\u2019s been living here about 7 years total. The house is in need of repairs and renovations and is not very energy efficient and we\u2019ve outgrown  it at this point with the size of our family. The house is in a very nice and highly sought after neighborhood and my wife loves it here. We\u2019ve been going around weighing pros and cons of buying a new home that fits our needs vs essentially knocking this one down and rebuilding it from the ground up to make it fit our needs. Financially and lending wise what would make the most sense? Is it easier to get a home loan vs a renovation loan? HELOC? Something else? I should also add that the home is still in her parents\u2019 name.\n\nAdditionally (if it helps), my wife bought a house once before with her ex husband. I\u2019ve never bought a house and my wife and I work in health care and first responder respectively. I know there\u2019s first time buyer programs, homes for heroes, etc. and together make about $250k a year.",

And I\u2019ve heard many stories of renovations getting a lot more expensive than estimated because of hiccups along the way (cracked foundations, plumbing, etc). My wife is more persistent about staying here as it is a very nice and quiet neighborhood built atop a hill that overlooks the city and is a great view. Most of our neighbors are older, retired or have good jobs so there\u2019s no rowdy people, house parties, crime, etc. we\u2019re probably the youngest couple on our block being in our late 30\u2019s and pretty much the only ones with kids in the home.",

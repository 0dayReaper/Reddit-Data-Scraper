    "postText": "I am going to be renting a house with two other people. The discussed plan is for two of us to pay our third to the other and him pay the rent. They are both trustworthy steadily employed guys so no concern on that end. \n\nMy question is, am I missing out on any benefits by not being the one to officially pay rent. Will paying through venmo still be able to be viewed as a rent payment history or are there any credit score benefits I could miss out on? \n\nAnd if that\u2019s the case, what is a better method to rent payment in this scenario?\n\nEdit: A lot of you are pro \u201cpaying directly\u201d I will take that into thought and look to do it that way soon. The relationship with the roommate is a long-standing 10+ year friendship. So I do trust his character but it is not lost on me that the only person you can completely be responsible for is yourself. \n\nThat being said, the \u201cbenefits\u201d I may have heard about with credit score boosts and other seems the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze on that one. I will talk to them about paying separate. Thanks everyone.",

My roommates are also standup good people with steady jobs, but let me describe what just happened last week.\n\nOur lease renewed on the 15th, and my roommate really, really wanted to be the one to take over the security deposit. A few weeks before that we both talked about getting cats, one for each of us. We hashed it out and agreed that even though our lease limits us to one cat we would both still have one each and it would be fine, we wouldn't say anything to the landlord and so on. That was our agreement. That said, the lease asks for a deposit for one pet, which is partly why my roommate really wanted to take over the full deposit (one month total rent + some for the pet).\n\nShe goes and adopts a kitten, I am bringing my cat back with me after visiting family, all seems okay. The week before I am supposed to come home she texts and says \"I don't think you should bring your cat back. The lease says only one cat. Plus, we all would have to agree to it.\". Now obviously she is just straight up lying, her plus the other roommate and myself had already agreed to this. Except, she is the one who has the pet deposit and she has texts telling me not to bring my cat too, no less. Totally disregarding our verbal agreement. Nothing I can do now because she has her name and her cat on a signed contract.\n\nSo the thing I am saying is that the more you can take on, the more choice you get. I don't even want to consider what kind of craziness she is going to try and pull when I move out and want my share of the security deposit back.\n\nI pay the rent for us three just like how you describe, they venmo me and I pay in the portal. There is a fee per payment so we do that to avoid the extra cost. There isn't too much value to me, since she just stole my cat right from under me, but if you go check the ledger for our rental you only see me as making payments. There is functionally no evidence she ever paid rent, other than not having been evicted. There is the argument that each person on the lease is responsible for paying the full balance each month and anyone would realize how it is actually paying, but it kind of looks good for me I guess. When I go to rent my next place after I graduate it will be a lot more expensive and when the new landlord calls I am hopeful my current landlord will just look at the register and see the $2100 payments made in my name like clockwork on the first of every month - might look like a good reference for that at least.\n\nAlso, let me getting screwed by my roommate be a powerful warning that you should get any important agreement between you and anyone in writing.",

There is at least one credit card that gives you extra points for paying rent on it just be wary if the card doesn\u2019t have a workaround for the fee. \n\nIt should be fine to just pay via Venmo as long as you label the payment appropriately \u201crent for property address - month and year\u201d so that you cannot be wrongly accused of not paying.

To avoid a worse case scenario ask to receive verification when he pays rent for your own records. \n\nThat said there are plenty of valid reasons for an arraignment like that. Reading your post as is it sounds like this probably isn\u2019t some run of the mill standard rental situation. I gotta assume there\u2019s a reason and it\u2019s in the missing context. \n\nWhere I\u2019m at there\u2019s plenty of average folks who rent out a property maybe two and they\u2019re usually retired and the place they rent has been in their family for forever. It\u2019s always maybe a lil shady and questionable but those are the places you find the cheapest rent. I\u2019ve had and heard of plenty others who\u2019s landlords ask for just one point person for communication and the single payment.\n\nIf it\u2019s not small like that or wasn\u2019t requested by the landlord. I wonder how/why the discussion came up. Did he just propose/push for that or was there a reason or thing that prompted it. \n\nI know some big apartment complexes here will tack on fees for certain types of payments. Was that a factor?\n\nAlso what\u2019s your relationship to these guys? Strangers? Lifelong friends? Lots of variables that might make you feel better or worse. \n\nDo you have a formal lease and are you on it?",

I would strongly recommend researching a credit card that you pay off in full each month, this is going to be the base recommendation anyone gives you about building credit.\n\nAnother note is that companies like Flex or Esusu will cause your score to drop due to a closed account when you move. Definitely not a big deal but something to keep in mind. \n\nAs for your payment situation, I mean it's probably not a great idea and you should look into paying rent directly.",

    "postText": "A family friend has had a job transfer outside of the US and I want to buy their car, but their car has a lien on it from the loan provider. The seller is somewhat in a bad financial place right now and does not have the money to pay off the loan and therefor they do not have the title to the car and they are leaving the country in a month.  All of these factors have allowed me to negotiate a great price on the car, but when I negotiated the price I did not know that they couldn't pay the loan off before selling it to me.\n\nWhat is the best way to proceed in the purchase of this vehicle? I've already had my mechanic check it out and he gave me the green light.  I don't want to lose this deal as my current vehicle is 15 years old and on its last legs and I am very confident about everything else about this deal.  I am in California if that makes any difference.\n\nEdit/Update with More Information - This is a longtime family friend of over two decades.  I do not sense they are ripping me off and they are willing to do whatever is needed to conduct this transfer safely and legally.  I am simply asking what is the safest and most financially prudent way to make the purchase.",

Their sale price is what is owed on the vehicle and only after receiving the money they will release the title. If you pay this person anything you won\u2019t see it again, and you won\u2019t have a vehicle when they repossess it. You can\u2019t register the vehicle in your name without the title. \n\nThis is all around a terrible idea.",

The bank will refund any loan overpayment back to the borrower. \n\nWhen I worked at a bank we would get letters from dealers buying vehicles all the time.

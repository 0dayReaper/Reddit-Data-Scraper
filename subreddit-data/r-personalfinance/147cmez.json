    "postText": "I\u2019m hoping i could get some feedback from you all . I applied for financial aide for an ER visit . Sent them my paystubs , and court documents showing how much a month i  get for child support . They sent me a letter stating they need a months worth of banking systems from any banks with my name on it . I have two banks . One that used to be my main and that has my child support deposited into and i use that account for childcare bill and any child related expenses. I have another bank account that has my paychecks deposited into and i use that for my main account. I have money from my tax return in that account and I\u2019m freaking out that it will automatically disqualify for me for financial assistance. I\u2019ve never applied for financial assistance before .",

Look over the terms of their assistance closely and try to determine if your amount of current assets would exceed their terms.",

I also explained the major transactions in my account, including paying off a small loan to my parents.\n\nJust be truthful, but also thorough.",

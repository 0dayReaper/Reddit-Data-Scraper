    "postText": "My husband has about $50,000 in student loan debt and is taking advantage of covid relief federal student loan pause since 2020. As years went on, he was able to get good high paying job and save $50,000. Thankfully my student loan debt is paid off and we have no credit card bills or car loans or any other loans besides Mortgage we can easily pay for with our combine income. He makes about $90,000 and I make about $80,000 year. He really wants to pay off this student debt in one payment. Is it possible to Negotiate lower total amount to pay off loan since he can pay remaining balance in 1 payment? Like, he was going to negotiate pay back $40 or 35 K instead of $50 K since he has cash to do it. Or does it make sense to just do smaller bulk payments say $20,000 at a time? He thinks by paying 1 time I cash,  he could just pay less overall. He would deplete his savings by doing this but he easily can resave in next 2 yrs again and I also have about $50,000 saved in my own account. He does not qualify for any work or employment student loan repayment so he is on his own to repay with type of work employment.",

So I respect that.",

A mortgage is the only debt you should ever have to carry. Every other consumer debt is dead weight. Plus paying it off will free up more cash for your monthly budget for necessities like energy, food, etc..",

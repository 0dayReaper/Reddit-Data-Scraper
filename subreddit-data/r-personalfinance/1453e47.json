    "postText": "My wife and I have an HSA into which her employer pays $4000 (our insurance's out-of-pocket maximum) and we contribute up to the max. I was planning to start investing our contribution, using the employer's 4k to pay medical expenses along the way, but now I'm wondering if we should just pay off medical bills with our credit card and invest the entire HSA amount. We're both in our late 30s and the idea of having a nice big medical-expenses pot for our later years is very appealing.\n\nWith our cc situation we'd essentially get 2.25% back (transferring Chase Freedom Unlimited points to Chase Sapphire Reserve to use in the Chase travel portal), and at the moment we can cover our anticipated medical expenses without using the HSA funds. (We also have a chunk of money sitting in an HYSA - it's earning nicely at the moment, but since high interest rates won't last forever I do want to start thinking about the next step for that money at some point. Using it for medical expenses could help us draw it down.)\n\nMy understanding is that we can request HSA reimbursement for medical expenses at any point, even many years later, so long as we keep documentation for those expenses. So is there really any drawback (aside from the risks associated with investing the HSA funds) to this plan?",

Then it's wasted (though not totally cause the convenience factor).\n\nYou should be treating the HSA as a retirement account if you can. Depends on your salary but if you can handle your high deductable without the HSA, you'll be great. So yes, invest with HSA. Follow the flowchart.",

HSAs are one of the best investment vessels so keeping it in there invested and not using it for medical expenses now is a big win.\n\nI guess a risk is that they could change the policy of being able to use any age bills to remove the money later, but you'll have medical bills your entire life, likely higher as you get older or have a family, so not a real risk in my book.",

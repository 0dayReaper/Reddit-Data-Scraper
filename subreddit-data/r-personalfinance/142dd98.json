They also seem to have several connection providers which meant when things were glitching through plaid I could switch to connecting with the fincity connector and the account info came through perfectly... that kind of optionality didn't exist in any of the other platforms I tried and meant I could get far far further along in automatic transaction updates (mint still has more institutions overall though)",

Save money by cutting devs that work on desktop apps and turn them into wrappers for the web or mobile platform. It nearly always means less functionality for the same price. The majority of users only ever use the basic functions, so it's deemed an acceptable loss to cut the functionality for the power users.\n\nWho cares if you make a shittier product, just call it \"sleek\" or \"optimized\" or \"streamlined\", slap an iOS-esc UI on it, and rollout. Focusing only on the lowest common denominator (tech illiterate customers) is the order of the day.\n\nThat's almost certainly what happened with Mint. They cut the development team and to reduce workload, they just straight up removed features.\n\nEdit: got my terms backward",

There's not a single ad presented in the UI, nor do I receive email communication from Simplifi/Quicken about credit card or loan options. That's in stark contrast to a service like Mint, where I feel half the UI are ads.\n\nI guess that's not to say they couldn't still be selling my data. There's no reference to the sale or sharing of end-user data within the terms of service. Still theoretically possible I guess, but it would be pretty illegal to do so without disclosure.",

Granted, I'm only checking in on it twice a week to aggregate transactions, but it's nice having a single point of reference for everything.\n\nMy primary bank account is a bit odd (All-in-One checking/LOC tied to properties), but Mint handles it correctly. I've not been able to find another product (paid or otherwise) that can parse that account at all so everything else has been a non-starter since most of my money flows through that account.",

For example, I cut my eating out spending in half, and cancelled a couple subscriptions I realized I didn't use enough to justify the cost.\n\n5) Over half the fun-money purchases I'd usually make, I now just throw into investments because seeing the little green bar on YNAB fill up gives me more dopamine than buying the videogame or candy or whatever.\n\nLike obviously the app doesn't directly give you money or make the things you buy cheaper, so if that's the only thing you count as \"saving money\" then under that definition it wouldn't, but what it does do is fundamentally alter the way you think about spending, and you'll naturally just spend a hell of a lot less because of that. I'd say that counts as it saving me money.\n\nNot to mention, the peace of mind I get from using it is unparalleled. I simply do not think about money anymore except for once a month when I audit my budget, and for the 20 seconds it takes to check and update the budget when I make a purchase.",

If you consistently overspend in a category, you then increase the allocation to that category in the future.\n\nYNAB effectively uses Zero Based Budgeting, which assumes nothing about income or expenses in the future. You start every budget cycle with $0 and allocate every dollar as it comes in or goes out. You cannot overspend in a budget category with unallocating the amount that is over from somewhere else. It's the digital equivalent of getting your paycheck in cash and dividing it up into envelopes marked \"Rent\", \"Groceries\", \"Water Bill\", etc and then taking money from those envelopes to pay the expenses. If you don't have enough cash in your groceries envelope you have to move it from another envelope - you can't just put it on your credit card and promise to spend a little less next month to make up for it.",

The software will mildly scold you in the month you do it, but you absolutely can deficit spend on credit cards and the software will just treat it as new debt to be paid off however/whenever your choose.\n\nIt'll even let you set a date you want to pay it off by and it'll automatically keep track of your payoff progress.\n\nIt's still very much zero-based budgeting, but you can totally overspend one month and then allocate less wherever next month to pay it off (by allocating extra money toward the CC payment \"category\" or going to the prior month and adding money to the original overspent category)",

My checking account is with a local FCU and works consistently as does Amazon.  My VISA is with Fidelity, through Elan, and it sucks.  But it's not an issue exclusive to PLAID/YNAB because every other day when I log in through a browser on my laptop I have to respond to a security challenge.  Selecting 'remember this device' makes no difference.  It doesn't.\n\nMy husband and I use the mobile app consistently to add transactions at the time of purchase so we always know how much we have in a category, i.e. groceries.  We also have lots of transactions on auto-pay, so they just roll along.  If the auto-import is broken, which it is a lot of the time, it's really easy to download the VISA transactions to a QFX file then drag  and drop them into the account in YNAB.  \n\nTakes me 5 minutes in the morning over coffee on the website.  \n\nAn upvote for account reconciliation also.  All of our accounts are balanced to the penny every week/month.  I totally can't wrap my head around any 'accounting' software that doesn't have reconciliation.",

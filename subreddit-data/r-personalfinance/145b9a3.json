    "postText": "I'm moving to nyc this summer and will be making over 6 figures (125). I have never seen this kind of money in my life but I know NYC is expensive so I am hoping to get some help/advice on living on a budget.\r  \n\r  \nI have lived a very frugal life and have gone through some financial trauma, so for years I have saved where I can and try not to spend on myself. I feel guilty when I spend money on \"wants\" rather than \"needs.\"\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, I worry that making over 6 figures will give me some false idea of financial security when NYC is so expensive, and I may overspend by accident.\r  \n\r  \nAny advice on how to budget? I calculated my take home pay after taxes, health care and 401K as 6,000. I don't know if this is accurate, liberal, or conservative. I'd like to save about 15K the first year outside of 401K if possible.\n\nMy rent a little over 2,300 in Brooklyn for a 1bed/bath. I will work from the office (midtown) maybe 2 days a week on average.\r  \n\r  \nHow much a month can I comfortably spend on dinners, shopping, experiences/shows etc? How much can I budget for \"fun money\" to encourage me to spend and actually experience the city I am moving to without feeling like I am eating into savings?",

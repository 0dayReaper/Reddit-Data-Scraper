    "postText": "I'm three years into my career post-masters and have been incredibly happy in my job. I make $56,000 currently. I am 90% WFH and have great work-life balance. Job has a great reputation for treating employees very well, I have no reason to leave. My current job typically 'caps' at $65k unless you're willing to take on overnight on-call responsibilities (i'm generally not).  \n\nMy wonderful supervisor recently left after nearly 15 years to take a state level job. A role directly under them is being posted, and it's come to my attention that this supervisor (strongly) wants me to apply (it's a very good fit for me, I would excel in this position and have extensive knowledge and experience in the specific role). I think I've built a great reputation, and I'm honestly very flattered in this situation.\n\nThat role is currently paying it's 4 employees in that position $74, $75, $76k, and one at $68k. I'm not sure what negotiations are like on the state level, but I'd expect/ask for at the very least 70-75k. \n\nThe job is mostly WFH (maybe 1x a week max. in office with 1hour each way commute), with potential for more travel/conference responsibilities (which is a con for me). Current commute is 15min 1x week.\n\nMy husband and I make decent money and are in a stable financial spot. We can pay our bills, own a home... However, an additional 20k would be incredible to invest a lot more/pay off my final bit of student loans, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPros:\n\n\\-Increase of 15-20k salary\n\n\\-significant increase in room for growth (responsibilities and income)\n\nCons:\n\n\\-leaving comfort and work-life balance\n\n\\-increase in commute (1hr each way, 1x per week max) and possible increase in travel to conferences etc. (I do not enjoy work travel). \n\n\\-lose pension at current position (it vests at 5 years, is not portable until that point, so I'd get a cash-out refund from my contributions of about $8k). Pension is 5% employee contribution, and calculated at: avg highest 5 year salary x .016 x years of service / 12 months. \n\n\\-leaving current job in a bind, that department would be honestly floundering without myself and my supervisor's specific contributions. I'm not trying to toot my horn, it's just the reality that it would leave them in a bind. I'd want/try to give as much notice as possible to help replace and train someone.",

Not many would describe their supervisors as \u201cwonderful\u201d, seems like a great opportunity for you\n\n3 years into a pension, especially when you can get the $8k out feels small comparatively.",

I read the job posting and had no interest.\n\nI think I'd want a bit more information, and could ask my former supervisor, what the WFH ability looks like long-term, overall culture, as well as travel requirements for conducting trainings/conferences etc. They knows that's not something I'm very interested in, but would occasionally for the right $ and position.",

Most people have to commute daily for at least an hour, and you do not. That's the real question you are pondering. Is $20K worth having to drive an extra 90 minutes once per week? \n\nSo if someone said to me *I will pay you $20K a year to drive your car for 90 minutes a week*, I would absolutely say yes. That's about 4500 minutes a year, or around $4.50 a minute you are in the car. An Uber Eats Delivery driver would be lucky to make $.25 a minute. That's a lot of money, and that's my opinion.",

If that wasn't your intention, I do apologize.\n\nThat said, my point stands either way. Speaking as someone who has had a significantly above average commute before, I see it as something very much to be avoided and which I'm personally willing to pay a fairly high price to avoid. Given that OP has expressed reservations about both this and the greater travel expectations and that they have a high-earning partner (i.e. the extra would be nice, but not transformational), I think their question is a rational one.\n\nOne other big lurking question is how certain they are that the job will remain something like 1/4 hybrid. A lot of employers, even ones that were previously fairly gung ho about long term remote work options, are now trying to force employees back more often. OP would want to be confident that the rug won't be pulled out from under them in this regard before committing to the new job if that extra commute time is a concern for them. I could honestly see taking a job with that long of a commute once a week, but the 3 days a week I typically come in now? No thanks!",

I had been fully vested for about six months so I was thankfully able to roll $25,000 into a 403b. My contributions were something like $8,000, so being vested got me an additional $17k. Had I kept the money there, they told me I would've gotten a benefit of $300/month at retirement. At that job they had what they called \"the rule of 85.\" Your years of state service plus your age had to equal 85 in order to get a full pension, which was 80% of your final income. So, you'd have to be there awhile to get a sizable benefit. \n\nI could see the argument for holding on a few more months and getting the rest of that money to rollover, but I don't think it's worth basing major life decisions on unless we're talking a big chunk of change.",

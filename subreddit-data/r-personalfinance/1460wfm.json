    "postText": "Hello! Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but my husband and I are going to start trying for a child next year and I planned on starting a brokerage account for our child that they can access when they\u2019re 21, putting in $100 a month, nothing crazy. \nThe conflict I have is if I should also do this for my two stepsons, 12 &amp; 8. My husband and I did set up two 529 accounts for them (my idea) so they would have the option to not take out loans for college and I\u2019m assuming their mom isn\u2019t planning any savings for them because she\u2019s currently in school herself and will be for a while so her budget is tight. \n\nI\u2019m a natural saver so I plan for these kind of things, but my husband and his ex are not. My husband doesn\u2019t have an opinion on this, he\u2019s very go with the flow. Still, I don\u2019t want my step kids to feel slighted and if I did the same for them there would still obviously be less money available to them because their investments would accrue interest over a shorter amount of time. \n\nI\u2019m also a little uncomfortable with the fact that there are more personal variables with who my step kids will grow up to be. I love them, but we have them 50% of the time and with influences they have from the other side of the family, I don\u2019t know who they will grow up to be when they turn 21. Granted I won\u2019t know who my own child will be either, but having her 100% of the time makes me feel more confident that she will be financially literate and responsible. What do you think the right thing to do is?\n\nTLDR: should my husband and I set up brokerage accounts for my step kids we set one up for our bio kid?",

                    "comment": "Yes, we have already fully invested in our retirement accounts. My biggest concern with the brokerage account is not knowing who your kid will be at 21, and we\u2019ve had issues in the past with coparenting where it became apparent there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of parenting happening with bio mom to such an extent that she wasn\u2019t taking them to school pretty regularly and we had no idea, but one of the kids fell behind a lot in reading and has been in remediation programs the last two years. (She didn\u2019t tell us, school never called, we found out through the report card) Their other side of the family has some questionable values but I won\u2019t get into it. Bio mom has also blackmailed my husband for money in the past and used making fake abuse claims with the kids as leverage so I\u2019m also concerned what her relationship will be with her kids if they have a good chunk of money starting out as adults, but that\u2019s really out of my control and not my business. \nThe advantage is I want to see all of the kids so well starting out, and I don\u2019t want anyone to feel slighted.",

Every attempt to make things \"fair\" in one respect will make things \"unfair\" from other angles.\n\nThe best you can do is just do whatever you think meets the goals of the family.\n\nA situation that many parents seem to forget is that you can always set aside money in accounts *in your own name*.  Then, whenever you decide the time is right or the situation is appropriate, you can choose to gift whatever you want.\n\nIn blended families, there will probably always be some degree of differential treatment amongst children.  \n\nAs you can tell, I don't have any specific answers for you.  Other than to evaluate that if one account type is appropriate for *your* children, you/SO have to really think about why it is not also appropriate for step children as the differential treatment here is a bit more forward and spelled out in in dollars.  \n\nPersonally, I'd just 529 and put away money in accounts in my own name.  I share your concerns about unrestricted access to cash upon becoming a young adult *regardless* of whether or not the child is of my bloodline.  With a 529, I can change the beneficiary to a different child if the money goes unused.",

To give more details, not that I need to, bio mom was addicted to drugs and that\u2019s why their marriage ended. She showed negligence and lost custody time with her kids. Of the bio parents and myself, I am the only one who has thought to put money aside for college for them and wants there to be something for them when they graduate. I want to provide them something in the correct way, but, I also saw this coparent blackmail and lie about my husband as a parent to courts in a very serious way to get money. So, I see red flags down the line where my step kids could be taken advantage of. This consideration is meant to protect them, no disadvantage them.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, so I was recently proposed an idea from my mother. \n\nlong story short is she would like to purchase a home outright(paid in full up front) under my name for herself to live in. \nAt first I saw nothing but red flags but after some consideration I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any potential upsides that I may have overlooked? \n\nMy main concern is that my fianc\u00e9 and I would soon like to purchase our own home, (currently renting) would this take away our FHA/ first time home buyer eligibility? Granted the first home I \u201cpurchased\u201d was paid in full so no loan required? \n\nCould I take equity from the first home to put a down payment on my second home(my primary residence) to help with the potentially larger down payment?\n\nIs the time frame of 1.5-2years for purchasing a second home still a factor if technically the first home is fully paid off? (This is based on the idea of renting your home out after living in it as your primary in order to save on capital gains tax) \n\nMy apologies if this is all over the place but I would greatly appreciate ALL and ANY concerns or advice. \n\nCan I benefit from this situation? Or will it put me in a hole? \n\n[If it helps, a lender would approve me for the home that is within my mothers budget] \n\nThank you!",

Are you planning to take out HELOC? Seems unnecessary if you've already been approved for a normal mortgage.   \n\n\nMy view is that it's a lot of paperwork and involvement and complication for something that will give you little benefit in the end.",

            "comment": "What is your Mom trying to accomplish with this? Is she looking to tie up her estate so you will some day inherit it?    \nLook up Life Estates in your state. The people who bought our parents home had this on their home. They bought their prior home in their own name and then sold it to their children for $1 in a Life Estate. They lived in it and maintained it, paid all the taxes, insurance etc. The daughters as 'Remaindermen', neither could sell the property without the agreement of the other. That assured they always had a place to live. \n\nSo when these 'buyers' got to 78/80 yrs old and his knees got bad and he couldn't do steps they went looking for 1 story living and bought our parents house using the money from the sale of the first house to purchase this one, their daughters signed. When they die the home will belong to the children. \n\nIn this type of set up there would be no debt in your name. \n\nThe first time Homebuyer deals I think need 3 yrs of a gap between purchases and for FHA it needs to be your primary home. Years ago we had a home in another state as my husband got a 2 yr transfer, we decided to stay in the new state and were able get a mortgage using the first house as a sort of collateral I guess but we financed 100% of the 2nd one. Later refinanced when the rates went down.  \n\nTaking an equity loan on what is really your Mom's house puts her at risk, even with the Life Estate there is a level of risk that should be explored with an attorney.\n\nIf you get married and then divorced she would be at risk of losing her home if it's in your name and becomes a marital asset? or if God forbid you die or become incapacitated and can't pay bills same thing. \n\nShe, more than you needs to think about this and discuss it with an attorney unless she also has millions in cash invested elsewhere for her old age and potential for long term health care needs.",

Essentially she is on disability and would lose her benefits if they found out she purchased her own home after the divorce. \n\nIt\u2019s a lot of pressure to be asked this by her and I wanted to make sure I was in the right by politely declining. However because I can\u2019t know everything, I was curious if there was any way I could financially benefit from this scenario.",

Some rules are different based on age. \n\nIf she's also on Medicaid there's more rules to deal with. \n\nThere may be an out because she's replacing one home with another?

With that said, FHA loans are not first-time homebuyer loans. Anybody can get one. FYI, if you own that home, they are going to count taxes/insurance/HOA into your debt-to-income ratio so be aware that doing this could impact your ability to get another loan. \n\nIf you move forward with this, I wouldn't recommend doing a cash out refinance on that property in order to pay a larger down payment on the home you want to buy to live in. Cash-out refinance rates, especially on a property that won't be your primary residence, are not very good right now and it would probably not be offset by any rate benefit from a lower LTV on the house you want to buy.",

            "comment": "I don't know what your relationship is with your parents as a whole. This discussion has been mostly on how you might benefit, or at least not be hurt by this situation.\n\nThere is another piece here however. Your parents divorced, generally a big deal in a child's life regardless of age. \n\nUsually even a bigger deal for the parents, women in particular if they were stay at home Mom's for any length of time. \n\nYou do need to consider Mom's age, type of disability, income regardless of where it comes from. Will she be getting alimony. She needs a place to live?? This has the potential to become a much bigger problem unless you feel like you can just walk away?? and leave her potentially homeless or showing up on your doorstep with no where else to go? \n\nWould she be able to pay the bills if she stayed in current home after divorce? which presumably she owns half of? Would it be better if she stayed there and took in a tenant to help pay some of the cost vs moving out/giving up ownership and maybe not be allowed to buy something else/risk benefits. Is your Dad leaving the home too?\n\nSome disability is based on prior income, work history and is sort of an early retirement SS for the disabled. I have an uncle who had disability because he couldn't work any more but owned a smallish apt building with 5 units he collected rent on and ultimately sold for 1.6million without issue. Moved to Europe and lives like a king in a village. It didn't have anything with his assets. It was determined by his inability to work and how long he had worked and paid into SS over the previous decades.",

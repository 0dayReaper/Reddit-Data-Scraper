That would give me time to fully vet my employers HSA plan and decide a path forward for 2024 \n\nMainly looking to offset some taxes by deducting HSA contributions but also use the HSA every year as an alternative retirement investment vehicle",

There is generally no employer restriction on time period for which the HSA must be opened.\n\nThere may be a time period for which *enrollment* in an employer based HDHP (ie open enrollment), but this does not generally translate to the HSA account itself.\n\nReach out to HR.  Ask them how to open up the HSA.\n\nOften times HR can set up HSA contributions from payroll even outside of open enrollment (occasionally some employers don't allow it).",

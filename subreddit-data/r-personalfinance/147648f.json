    "postText": "I started a job in San Francisco, California, roughly 5 months ago. I have now decided to quit with June 20th being my last day. Since the income tax I have paid so far at this job was based on my income for the entire year I was wondering whether I would get part of that tax back since I am leaving the job after roughly 5 months. If so, how drastic would this amount be?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "You haven't paid any income \"tax\" per se so far, you've paid withholding.  As with every year, when you file your tax returns next year for this year, you'll figure out exactly how much income tax you actually owe for the year.  If you've had more than that withheld total for the entire year, you'll get a refund.  If you've had less than that withheld, you'll have to pay more.\n\nSo what happens depends on:\n\n1. The total amount of withholding (and any quarterly estimated payments) from all jobs and sources, and\n2. The total amount of income from all jobs and sources, and\n3. What deductions or other tax breaks (such as tax credits) you may have for the year.\n\nTherefore, whether you will get anything back depends on what else happens during the year, not just that one job.\n\nIf you want to estimate it, you can pick any tax software you like and enter estimates for all of your income, deductions, and withholding for the year and see how it turns out.",

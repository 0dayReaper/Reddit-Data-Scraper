I\u2019m also looking to get into a rent soon and am wondering if having my name on the mortgage would impact my chances of getting a rent? Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

That could mean big capital gains for you if you sell the house.  If you inherit the house, you get the stepped up basis in the house - the value at the date of death.  If you sell the house, your capital gains will be substantially less, if any at all.",

    "postText": "Question- I want a Bank account in the USA and one that works well in other countries. is there a list for that or do you have recommendations?\n\nI'm trying to get a US Bank that works well Outside the US in other countries (Switzerland, Australia, Japan as examples) and when ever I try to search up a list on google or other forums, the only answer I get are list of offshore banks in other countries. It's really frustrating when I try to specify my google searches and I don't get the rights results, is it a factor that Banks in the USA are just not good outside of the USA? I understand that Taxation with US banks can be a bit more annoying with US citizens and US Banks in general but. I would still like to have ease of access when I'm in other countries. In the past it has been nothing but annoying to access my bank accounts in other countries, especially with roadblocks as such - region blocked apps, region blocked websites, phone number verification on entry of website or app, requirement to visit a physical Bank branch often etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you live outside the USA with a US Bank account please let me know how easy it is and who you Bank with.  \n\n\nUpdate: I'm only going to be using a bank for general day to day / month to month activities, such as paying bills, transferring smaller amounts of money, ATM usage, deposits. not investing or counting it as savings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

You usually need an address in the US, plus social security number, etc.   \n   \nQuite frankly it\u2019s a little weird that a non-resident would want a US bank account that works outside the US unless they are trying to engage in some level of fraud.",

I both work overseas and get paid from an international bank based in Australia. I have a Wise account and debit card that doesn't incur the fees that other US banks do. The wire transfer fee is great and I hold 4 different currencies in my wallet. I can also make really easy transfers from those wallets, I live in places people can transfer money easy to each other using SWIFT and ACCT Numbers.  I also receive 4.12% APY on my US account.",

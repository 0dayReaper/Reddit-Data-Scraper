    "postText": "I've seen several posts on here lately with people that seem to be in a rush to buy a house even when their personal circumstances or finances aren't conducive to home ownership. \n\nYou don't have to buy a house. It's OK to rent. In fact, renting can be awesome. \n\nBut u/nutbustingfuckdragon, rent is just throwing money away! \n\nNo it's not. You're paying for shelter. Is paying for food just throwing money away? \n\nBut u/nutbustingfuckdragon, houses values always go up! \n\nNo they don't. In general, on a long enough timeline they do - but you aren't going to own your house for 150 years. If you bought a house in 2015 and sold it in 2021, you probably made good money. But what about people that bought in, say, 2006 and had to sell because of a divorce in 2010? \n\nBut u/nutbustingfuckdragon, rent always goes up! \n\nNo it doesn't. In general, on a long enough timeline, it does go up BUT Rent is determined by what the market will bear. If there is overdevelopment in a particular area and supply exceeds demand, do you think prices will still go up? Nah. But yeah, rent does generally go up IN AGGREGATE but that doesn't mean jack shit for one particular market. Rents went down in SF over the last year - does that matter if you live in Cleveland? No. The opposite is true as well. \n\nBut u/nutbustingfuckdragon, my mortgage never increases! \n\nTrue! However, HOA fees, taxes, and maintenance costs do! \n\nBut u/nutbustingfuckdragon, buying is always a better investment than renting! \n\nNo it's not. Houses are expensive af and maintaining them is too. You hear on here and r/realestate all the time \"I bought my house for 150k and sold it for 250k! I made 100k!\" \n\nNo you didn't. How much did you spend on transaction costs for the purchase and the sale? How much did you spend on mortgage interest? How much did you spend on maintenance? How much did you spend on HOA fees and taxes? All of those things are REAL MONEY that has to be spent because you own a house. No one ever f'ing includes those figures. \n\nYes, in general, if you buy a house and hold it for a long time, you will come out ahead over renting but here's the thing: most people don't own any single house for 30+ years. The costs of buying and selling real estate are huge. \n\nAnd here's the x factor: mobility. Houses are a goddamn boat anchor. \n\nOh sick I just got offered a cool new job on the other side of the country! As a renter, I email the management company and fucking dip. House owner? Buckle up - you're going to spend 10s of thousands of dollars to sell your house and it's going to take AT LEAST 30-45 days to close the transaction. In more normal times, you could be looking at months. Meanwhile, you have to maintain the place, pay the mortgage, and worry about your neighbor's methhead cousin stealing your copper pipes. \n\nI could go on and on. I've owned houses before and I'll own them again. I currently rent. Everything that's annoying about renting has an equally annoying counterpart in home ownership. It's a lifestyle choice. Do not rush into making yourself house poor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Yes, you still have to worry about taxes, utilities, food, maintenance, health insurance and transportation, but your monthly outlays are significantly reduced by outright ownership.  \n\nTo me, that's the entire point.  Your management changes an you get some new micromanaging dickhole?  Take a different job.  \n\nMoreover, you can quietly and peacefully exit the entire system with proper planning.  Gardens, chickens, solar, wind, battery backup, underground cistern, passive solar design, life of structure siding and a metal roof will get you close to a century of only needing to pay for transportation, healthcare and taxes.  \n\nThere is not a better way to recapture your existence while maintaining a modern SoL.",

                    "comment": "Depending on the situation (doesn't apply to all landlords), they may benefit from economies of scale on things like repairs and taxes though. \n\nFor example: \n\nIn my township, property taxes on an average house are ~$6k a year depending on the house. Property taxes on the apartment complex I used to rent were ~$80k a year, but that complex had 40 units in it. So while the landlord was absolutely passing on the cost of the property taxes to us (the renters), the cost being passed on was much less per person. \n\nThe apartment complex had a full-time handy-man (it's a small company that owns ~3 complexes in the wider area of between 20 and 40 units per complex). It would obviously be patently ridiculous for a homeowner to have a full-time handyman for their house, but across over a hundred units it was much cheaper than calling up a handyman and paying service fees per call etc.\n\nFor appliances, they could buy them in bulk and save per unit. They'd buy a lot of 10 fridges and store them until they were needed. This was also nice as a renter... for example when our fridge broke, we had a brand new one in place less than 2 hours after calling the office to report the issue. Same for laundry appliances, water heater, etc. (we lived there for 7 years and it was an old complex, so there were some things breaking that were quickly replaced while we were there)]\n\nLandscaping crews would give them a good deal. A lot of the costs for the landscapers are in loading/unloading equipment and travel time... so per-unit the cost to have the grounds kept up was much cheaper than similar service at a single family house. A lot of tradespeople and services like that will also prioritize longterm business-to-business contracts over ordinary 'general public' calls because there is often less hassle getting paid and once the business relationship is established the stability of it is worth taking a little less $$. \n\nObviously all of these costs are factored into the rent price. And obviously an individual landlord renting a single-family house wouldn't benefit from these economies of scale. But if you're renting an apartment in a complex even though the landlord is definitely not just eating the cost what gets passed on to renters may be much less than what a similar service/item would cost to purchase themselves in a home they owned.",

You have to think a little bit more than just at surface the surface level. \n\nThe idea that renting is just throwing money away is simply not possible in a well functioning market. In a well functioning market, one should be indifferent between renting and buying. Obviously there is friction in the market, it\u2019s not perfect. That\u2019s why people should examine for themselves which makes sense. In many cases, renting is actually better.\n\nIf the non-recoverable cost explanation is too confusing for you, try thinking about it this way\u2026 When you buy any asset (a home in this case) you are paying for the entire useful life of that asset. When you rent a home, you are paying only for the useful life during your rental period. If you buy the home you will eventually sell the home, and you are selling off the remaining useful life, essentially making it so you paid for the useful life while you lived there. So both in theory are the same in a functioning market.\n\nYes, homes usually appreciate in value, but that gain is offset by taxes, opportunity cost, interest expense, maintenance etc.",

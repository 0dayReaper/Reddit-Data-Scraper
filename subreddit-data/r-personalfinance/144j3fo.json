    "postText": "Hi all, long time lurker here. Had to make a spare account though. \n\nI\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s in the Bay Area, married with 2 kids. We\u2019re somewhat looking to move from our primary residence. We gross around $420k annually from our W2 incomes, split mostly down the middle. Rental property covers PITI, so I don\u2019t count that for the purposes of this question. We\u2019re maxing out our 401k\u2019s that have no employer match each year. We don\u2019t contribute to any type of IRA anymore due to lack of tax benefits.  Our employers have a reasonable pension when we retire, assuming if it\u2019s still there in the future.  We generally save about $1-2k/month now because we have to pay for daycare / school until public school starts, at which point we\u2019ll shift those tuition funds to savings for the kids. \n\nWe have an investment property that is netting slightly positive. We have a primary residence as well, both mortgages PITI is around $10k/month. Both interest rates are below 3% and we\u2019re lucky that we have good tenants.  The investment property was purchased nearly 10 years ago which has accumulated quite a bit of equity. The primary was purchased 2 years ago which also has quite a bit of equity (supposedly). We can afford to make payments if we have a vacancy, which was a primary constraint we needed to be comfortable before converting to an investment property. \n\nWith us trying to move, should I sell the investment property?  Should I consider a 1031, with the intention of converting the future investment as a primary residence or just sell our current primary residence?  Ultimately the low interest rate is a golden handcuff. We don\u2019t mind the area we live too much, just would like a change in scenery (weather mostly).",

Meaning, most investment properties are negative after factoring in depreciation which is not a cash deduction.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering a 1031, you should really hire a CPA. Not at all a DIY friendly endeavor.\n\nIn order to give you any real advice, someone would need to know the specific numbers we\u2019re working with. Selling the investment involves depreciation recapture, selling the personal involved homeowners exclusions, 1031 involves so much to account for. Lot of factors to consider",

I haven\u2019t considered the depreciation. \n\nInvestment property was purchased around $600k and supposedly worth $1.5m. Primary was purchased around $1.8 and is supposedly worth $2.3m. I say supposedly because these are average numbers between realtor (says higher) and Redfin / Zillow (which show lower surprisingly).",

Assuming the mortgage is relatively small, it sounds like you\u2019d walk away with ~500-700K in cash after taxes.\n\nUnless you\u2019re really gonna make real estate a significant source of income for yourself, I\u2019d avoid doing a 1031 exchange. In my opinion, you\u2019d rather have that cash from the sale and put it in a fund than tying yourself up with more real estate; and the capital gain doesn\u2019t go away, it\u2019s just deferred. Plus you have full time jobs.\n\nSelling your primary residence you\u2019ll be able to exclude all of the gain, and you\u2019ll walk away with roughly $350K after selling expenses it sounds like.",

If we were to find another investment property of similar nature that we would want to be our future home, we\u2019d keep it as a rental for a short period before converting to our primary. This way the taxes stay with us until we eventually pass it to our kids. \nB. This gives us an option to shop for our future primary home without having to move twice to sell our current primary. \n\nAlso not all rosy. Here\u2019s some of the negatives I see for selling or doing a 1031 for our investment:\nA. We lose an incredible rate. We refi\u2019d right at the beginning of Covid rather than buying (to our detriment because of the substantial delay). \nB. The area is pretty desirable because of its proximity to SF. It\u2019s also pretty safe because of the local PD. \nC. The tax rate is something we\u2019ll never see again, which is something I\u2019m not sure how to value. \nD. We have to terminate our lease with some really great tenants. While not the dealbreaker, it\u2019s another consideration. \nE. This has provided us some tax shelter because it\u2019s considered an investment. Well immediately lose that once we sell the investment.  \n\nWhat would say is the best route to move from our primary residence? Keep the investment and move / sell / buy / move?  Sell the investment and primary?  \n\nOf course the other alternate is stay status quo. I\u2019m just not sure if this is the most financially smart thing to do either.",

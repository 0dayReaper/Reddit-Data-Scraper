    "postText": "I\u2019m sure this will get buried among the many posts today, but it bears repeating: short-term fluctuations in the stock market are *short-term*. The fact that the market is down right now does not affect your long-term investment outlook, as stocks are a long-term game. If you sell now, you will lose out on the rebound, just as my parents did during the financial crisis of 2008/2009. You do not want to sell now unless you are selling as part of your financial planning objectives that you have identified long before the whole Coronavirus panic hit.\n\nEdit: this did not, in fact, get buried among the other posts today. RIP my inbox\n\nEdit2: to answer some common questions:\n\n1. \u201cIs now a good time to invest?\u201d - that\u2019s a weighted question, and not one I can answer directly. There are many factors to determine whether or not it\u2019s a good time to invest. Please refer to the wiki for investing resources to see if now is a good time for you to invest.\n\n2. \u201cShould I be reallocating from stocks to bonds now?\u201d - as mentioned above, reallocations should be evaluated as part of your overall retirement strategy. A reallocation is basically selling some investments and buying others in place of those you sold; as such, it is generally unwise to reallocate in response to a single event and should really be done as part of your strategy towards retirement (e.g. reallocating from stocks to bonds as you get older to limit risk exposure).\n\n3. \u201cWill xxxxx affect me?\u201d - I don\u2019t know. Although I am a financial professional, if you have any questions relating to your particular circumstances, you should seek out a financial professional outside of Reddit or refer to the wiki in this sub for specific information.\n\n4. \u201cWhat if you\u2019re close to retirement? Should I sell?\u201d - if you\u2019re close to retirement, the general financial planning consensus is that you should not have a significant percentage of your wealth in equities. Example allocations would be anywhere from 80/20 or 90/10 bonds to equities. If you have any more than 20% equities and are close to retirement, yes you should probably think about reallocating to bonds, but not because of this recent stock market panic. Again, please consider speaking to a financial professional or using the sub\u2019s wiki for additional info.",

I think it's important to pay attention to this and let it inform you about the relative risks of investing and the importance of having a diversified portfolio.  \nSeeing the money I have invested in the market grow for the past few years while my savings account emergency fund grew much more slowly was hard to watch, because it felt like that money was not being used effectively. This is a good reminder (especially for those of us who are more risk-averse) that it's good not to have everything tied up in stocks.",

I've found incrementally bumping up the percentage withheld until it starts to really be noticeable/painful for me works for me. \n\nSupposedly the target is to have 1 year salary in retirement savings by the time you're 30, but it's best to treat that as a floating target depending on your personal situation IMO.",

It would be ridiculous to expect 1 year salary at my current rate, or even the previous rate.\n\nIn my opinion that's really only a goal for people who are working in incredibly stagnant fields and start working right out of college\n\nEdit: For clarity, the statement is bullshit for the majority of people. Maxing your contribution doesn't make sense if it means you still have student loans or credit card debt. Your 20's are some of the most chaotic years of life. I think a better goal (in the same vein) is \"twice your income by 40.\" By then things have settled down. Wages are steady, kids a little older, house partially paid off, ect.",

Basically it entails keeping your investment strategy consistent, keep investing in your funds even as the market is going down.  While it means you're going to see a lot of losses in this sort of market it also means you'll continue buying all the way to the bottom and you'll catch the upside as the market goes back up (which it eventually will).",

I started out at 10% contribution, raised it to 12% a few years ago, and just recently raised it again to 15%. \n\nRight now, my 401k balance (notwithstanding this week's fluctuations) is equal to approx 85% of my salary. I've seen guides that suggest that at 30 y.o, you should have approx a retirement savings equal to your salary. I'm almost there but not quite and I turn 30 in 6 months. \n\nIf you can save a couple thousand a year, you're well on your way. Easiest way I've found is to increase my contribution amount when I get a raise. If you're already used to living at a certain income level, it makes it easier to just put extra money away rather than trying to become more frugal later on.",

Your investment choices are yours and yours alone.   \n  \nIf you've got a heap of debt, you may be best served maximizing your employer's match and then paying down your debt with the rest of your income.  \n  \nBut if you're largely debt free, definitely max out your employer match, and then as much as you can stomach (up to the Federal limit, of course).  \n  \nHowever, depending on your age, income, tax brackets/situation, etc, you may decide to defer some of your money into a 401k and some into a Roth IRA. Or  maybe your employer has a Roth 401k option.  That might be worth looking into.  \n  \nHowever, you'll also want to consider your other personal goals.  If you want to buy a house, you may decide to aggressively save in cash, in order to put down 20%, or whatever else your goals and needs might be.  \n    \nMake sure your emergency fund is... funded.  Make sure you're living within a budgeted amount that is doable and comfortable for you.  \n  \nYou don't want to defer so aggressively into your 401k that when an emergency hits, you have to take a loan or other withdrawal from your 401k.  That's really expensive and bad for your retirement.    \n  \nI know that's not a concrete answer, but I hope it helps provide some context.  Good luck and happy saving!",

If the alternative, is letting $15k sit in a savings account making 1% for 3 years vs 6% (conservative) in a 401k for those same three years, then you've lost approx $2,400 in what could have been in your retirement account.\n\nThen say you need to borrow that 15k for an emergency - if you take it from savings, your 401k is unaffected (but also 15k + 2.4k lighter than it would have been invested).\n\nIf you borrow it from your 401k, the balance is still $2,400 higher than it would have been.  So even though you are no longer investing that 15k, you are still net positive.\n\nAll of this to say - you still need an emergency fund, because you can only take one loan out against your 401k.  But be smart.  Don't sit on 15k.",

If your older, you should've been invested in bonds rather than stocks since they are safer than stocks (and income is more stable, generally speaking)",

Is this because all these companies may have lost some of their own tangible assets (like factories or cash), or because certain companies went belly-up and therefore no longer exist in my mutual fund, that my $1000 pre-drop isn't worth $1000 post drop?",

Looking back at 2008, the market cut in almost half (16k to 9k) and it took \\~5 years to return to its original level.  We could be as good as being at the bottom, or we could just be starting to roll off a steep edge.  It could be better, it could be worse.  Just hope we don't do the equivalent of the Great Depression\\*, which went from 5k down to 800 (1929 to 1932) and took until 1958 (29 years) to recover.  \\*Note: inflation adjusted numbers in DOW historical.\n\nIf someone reads short-term as meaning &lt;1 year and can cash out, they probably want to hold that as cash in hand.  If they read short-term as &lt;3 years, they're still not necessarily in a good spot.  If we're strictly talking retirement accounts for someone 10+ years out, this is an inconsequential speed bump and a good spot to buy.\n\nEdit: Note for inflation-adjusted numbers, and source:  [https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart)",

We're cheaper than we've been in a while - we first hit this DOW rating in 2018.\n\nCould it go lower?  Absolutely.  Could it go much, much lower?  Absolutely.  Could it be bottomed out and rebound this week?  Absolutely.  Does anyone know for sure?  Absolutely not.\n\nI'd sooner believe we're not done going down and may drop a good bit more.  I think shut-downs, supply issues, and the number of people that will lose work because fewer will eat out or go to large gatherings will further tip the market.\n\nStill, it's important to note that one of my other replies to a reply on this comment is about a friend that loves to remind me kittens out picked a manager in a short-term investment strategy.

Your ownership interest in that company would have remained even as that company renamed itself to \"Motors Liquidation Company\" and sold off its assets, including the right to conduct business under the \"General Motors\" name. Then your shares would have remained worthless as Motors Liquidation Company turned into trusts that just pay out claims related to warranties or other types of claims.\n\nSo even though the business lines make money today, in 2020, under the name \"General Motors,\" your investment in those business lines would have been cut off and worth nothing by mid 2009.\n\nSee also Clear Channel, which became iHeartMedia and ended up in bankruptcy, to split its billboard and radio/broadcasting business. The business lines are making money today, but the pre-2018 owners were pretty much wiped out in its bankruptcy, and today's owners primarily derive from creditors, not shareholders, of the pre-2018 company.\n\nSo in a sense the investment decision today doesn't look to whether a business will survive, but whether a particular shareholder interest will survive. Lots of companies survive a Chapter 11, but usually shareholders get wiped out or are required to pay money to continue to own any part of the new reorganized company.",

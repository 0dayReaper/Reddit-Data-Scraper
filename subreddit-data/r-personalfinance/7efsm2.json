    "postText": "Hello, I only recently came back to my college dorm after having to drive back home to talk to officers to inform me that my last parent has passed away.  \nI do not have any other adult relatives to rely upon.  \nI will admit right now, I am naive and young. I don't know a single thing about the real world yet and how financing works. I don't know what responsibilities I bear now that I am alone. I'm just looking for mostly financing advice on what I have to get done quickly as possible so that I do not have to pay hefty fines or debt later on.  \nThis is all the information I know so far.  \nI am in the New Jersey area.  \nI'm estimating my father only had 3 or 2 thousand dollars saved, maybe even less.  \nHe owns a 2008 car.  \nI am not sure if he had life insurance.  \nI am not aware of any loans he owes.  \nFor sure he has bank accounts, but I am not allowed by the police to retrieve my father's wallet. (For now)  \nWe lived in someone's basement, and we don't pay rent, because of certain reasons, it's a complicated situation.  \nIf anyone needs further information please pm or comment, I will respond as soon as I can.  \n(Edit: I woke up this afternoon and I didn't expect this to blow up. I thank everybody for their supportive comments and messages. It really means a lot to me and I'll try my best to read everything.)  \n(Edit 2: I never thought I would receive so many thoughtful and helpful messages and comments. I feel a lot more comfortable with all the love that's been shown. I read every single message and comment as much as I can. Because I feel so grateful towards all of you guys, I thought that would be the least I can do to respect you guys back. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You guys really showed me there is still light in life.)",

You may also be able to order his credit reports.\n\nThe good news is that while his creditors have a claim on any assets he had, they don't have any claim against you.\n\nFor example, if he owed $20,000 on the car, but it was only worth $4,000, they can't come after you for the other $16,000 (unless you wanted to keep that particular car for some reason.)\n\nIf he left massive medical bills, the hospital budgets to take those losses.\n\nSome unscrupulous debt collectors do try to convince people to pay off debts that are not theirs.  Don't fall for it, and get everything in writing. \n\nAlso, talk to your school's office or councilor. They probably have some resources for you.  It is going to take a lot of time to get everything settled, but it shouldn't take your money.",

Hopefully that individual can help.\n\nYou may want to consult an attorney that specializes in these sorts of situations. (handling wills and end of life financial issues)\n\nYou might look into free legal counseling.\n\nYou will need a copies of the death certificate to take control of any accounts, close them, pay bills out of them, etc.\n\nGo through the computer, mail, and bills and make a list of all of his accounts. If the computer is password protected it can be bypassed. (Easily if it's windows) \n\nGet a copy if his credit report from all three agencies. Equifax, TransUnion, Experian. I think Equifax is the biggest and most important.\n\nBest of luck. I am sorry for your loss.",

Some will simply ignore it and send your parent to collections where they will try and hound you. Give them exactly one warning and sue them if they don't leave you alone on it. \n\nI'm also going to second everyone's suggestion on counseling from your school. I lost my old man and it was as if there were two acts to my life all of a sudden and I could never go back to the first. I walked in a daze for months. I really wish I'd have went to therapy of some sort. And be prepared to cry at the drop of a hat.  Life will find a way of dropping you when start to get back to normal.",

This subject came up, He said we offer 5 certs free but you'll need many more. How many we asked? Oh, I'd start out with no less than 20. We inquire about the cost. He states $9 a pop + $6 per 'to expedite' the process. Mom scoffed. The FD said politely delaying this portion of the process was a much bigger delay down the road. So we move on. As he's pointing out caskets by price levels, he actually used death certs as an upsell. The wall on the right got you 10 additional free certs, the wall on the left got you 20 additional. Yeah, sounds sleazy but the grand total of 25 was almost the magic number as Mom has used over 20 of them. I never thought I'd live to have a death certificate conversation on the WWW but your advice is spot-on. Death is truly a learning experience for the living.",

Been through this 3 times in the last 5 years, and copies of death certificates can be expensive, especially if you don't order them all at once.  Slow down, take a breath and collect up all the accounts.  Call them directly and find out if they actually need an original copy. Usually, the bigger accounts (and the petty ones) want originals, but many will be fine with a copy.  I only needed about 4-5 with all 3 of my parents.  Mostly, this will take time making phone calls and getting everything together.  Many people and companies will be very kind and helpful, but be careful and know your rights first, so you can protect yourself.  It feels overwhelming, but you have time to get organized and take care of yourself.",

Depending on your state, the advice you are being given in other comments about going straight to the court with a death cert in hand may not be applicable. Call around and be wary of lawyers that want you to hire them immediately.\n\nMy mom passed away in October in Florida. She had a few thousand in the bank, a mobile home and a car that my sister and I had paid off for her while she was battling cancer.\n\nBecause Florida state law requires you to hire an attorney even to file the simplest of probate options (summary administration) the lawyers we called advised us to just walk away since the attorney fees and court costs would absorb almost all of the inheritance. Also because she was on Medicaid, they are very aggressive about coming after estates for any benefits paid before death, so anything left over after that would have gone to them, most likely. We decided the headache wouldn\u2019t be worth it and could possibly put us in the firing line for creditors so we never filed probate and walked away from gaining access to her bank account.\n\nBecause the car and mobile home were exempt from probate, we were allowed to just get a death cert and take that to the DMV for transfer of title without going through the courts. \n\nAnother thing I didn\u2019t see mentioned was funeral/cremation costs. We found out that the county offers assistance for estates that have no funds, but was told that as soon as they see that she owned any assets at all, like a cheap car and mobile home, it would be denied. We paid $790 for the cremation and all death certs, etc. It was the absolute cheapest option available.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve been through this, I want to tell everyone I know to make sure that any elderly or sick parents file a \u201cpay on death\u201d for their accounts for any beneficiaries. It will allow you to gain access to those funds immediately without going through probate. Even if there is a will, you still have to go through long and expensive probate to get access to accounts. Pay on death avoids that process. This isn\u2019t about getting an inheritance; you might need that money to pay for travel and funeral expenses. We ended up paying thousands out of pocket to deal with the costs of my mom\u2019s passing.\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP is going through this. Best of luck.",

He didn't own a home so there is no mortgage to pay off. **If he had credit card debt YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THAT.** \n\nHere's a reliable, NON-BANK source for advice: \nhttps://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/10/what-to-do-when-a-loved-one-dies/index.htm\n\nHere. If you don't have the money to pay off credit cards they are NOT going to come after you for the money. If the cards are not in your name, they legally cannot. Don't worry, in the world of banking the rest of us are paying off the debts of the deceased with our fees and interest rates. https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2015-12-15/what-happens-to-your-debt-after-you-die\n\nAs for the car, if he owes anything on it and you don't want to keep it or don't have the means too, that will have to go bank to the lender. If you want to keep the car, IT'S YOURS. Rights of Inheritance are established by state law. Next-of-kin is spouse first, if there's no spouse, then it's kids first. \n\nSo, if it's paid off, you have a car. You don't have to operate it if you can't afford to. Just park it in a safe place and hold it until you can afford insurance and all the rest. You'll have to do a transfer of registration which you can do as soon as you get the Death Certificate. It's a form you fill out and you go to the DMV, present your I.D. and the Death Certificate and his Pink Slip. (If he owned it outright he has a Pink Slip somewhere. If not, you can get a copy from the DMV.)\n\nIf ANY of his debt-holders start hassling you, write them a letter. Tell them they can only contact you IN WRITING. Once you tell them that, they are not allowed to call you anymore. ",

Debts will be paid out of whatever is in the estate. That means, any money that was in bank accounts, sellable items, etc. Wherever is handling the estate, closing accounts, etc pays out of that money, NOT their own personal money. Any debts not paid (for example, if there's not enough money) go away. If you didn't sign or cosign for it, it's not yours, you owe nothing.  Anything left over after debts are paid is for op to keep (life insurance is exempt I think)\n\nCompanies will collect from the estate if they can. It's legal, and if they are owed a debt, they have the right to go after it. \n\nDon't use any of their credit cards/lines of credit, or personally agree to pay for anything. If you do then you are taking over responsibility for the debt. \n\nHonestly, it's best if you contact a lawyer/legal aid of some sort to help you through this.",

As much as you can, resist that urge.  It comes from a desire to control the uncontrollable events in your life \u2013 and as much as it feels like that's necessary, it's not.  There is plenty you can control right now.\n\nLook to stabilize things first.  Do it in stages.  Figure out where you're staying for the next week, and how you're going to eat.  That gives you a week to figure out where you'll stay and how you'll eat for the following two weeks.  From there, the next month, and so on, and so on \u2013 build it up slowly.\n\nI highly recommend googling \"sliding-scale counseling\" \u2013 you can get access to very good mental health at a price you can more likely afford.  Take care of your mind and your heart \u2013 they are going to be what keeps everything together long after your body is too tired to do anything.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help, and do what you can to pay people back \u2013 in your time, in helping out with housework or chores \u2013 they will remember it and it'll give you a feeling of satisfaction and a sense of ownership over your own life.\n\nAbove all \u2013 look for stability for the first year.  No big decisions.  Just aim to make it through.  You're not alone in this.  Everybody is trying to make it go the best they can, change what they can change, and cope with the rest.\n\nThinking good thoughts for you.  ",

She was orphan for over a year, and she had access to a laughably small pention (around 500 dollars/month, with the exchange rate at the time), worked long hours in a full time job so she could manage to pay her rent, in addition to attending classes, and she used to take pills to stay awake for the whole night if she needed the time to study for a test or do project for a class.\n\nNow, the dorm in our university had *very* loose regulations, the university has a very weak grasp on who exatly is living there, which sometimes leads to problems, but I decided to try to use it for some good, and I invited this girl to sneak in and stay at my dorm unit. Without rent to pay, she was able to leave the full time job, get a part time internship that paid a little less (but long term was way better because it was field experience in the industry for which we were studying at university) and finally get healthy sleep time. \n\nThis was all years ago, and everything worked out fine for her, today she is married and lives in a really nice apartment.",

                            "comment": "I'd reiterate /u/EENewton's good advice from above here: avoid major life decisions for a while\u2014you might feel like you have to drop out of college to support yourself, but I would recommending trying not to, at least until the dust has settled and you have a much broader picture of what your finances will be like moving forward.\n\nYou know this, but the kinds of jobs you can get with a college degree tend to pay more highly, so if you can feasibly make it through, even if that means going into a bit of debt (and/or perhaps switching to a cheaper college next year if necessary), it'll give you more money to take care of yourself in the long run. Student debt can be a big, big burden but if you work to keep it low early (through financial aid, grants, and being at a school with manageable tuition) it won't be a burden for long, and you'll end up making more money over your entire life even if the early portion is a bit leaner. [An addendum: try your hardest to stay at your current school, because they already know you and are invested in you! This might not work if their tuition is too high for you to manage, even with all the resources I mention below, but it's worth trying to stay at an institution of the same level of quality/credibility, that knows you.]\n\nI'd recommend reaching out to the financial aid office (or its equivalent) at your college, as well, and seeing what they can do for you\u2014this is something they'll want to know about, and that will almost certainly change your status/priority with them.\n\nYou'll want to talk to folks\u2014in financial aid, career planning, and any other student services\u2014to figure out the broad details of your student debt versus your college schedule versus the money you need to make to live. Come up with a plan to support yourself with a job (work study or otherwise), take classes (you might need to lower your courseload to keep your grades up, at least for a little while), and finish college expediently (but not rushedly). You'll have to figure out a summer living scenario, but from your story it sounds like your father's current housing situation might work for you (you might want to check in with them and see if you can stay there during the summer)\u2014and if not, your school might be able to help out\u2014often they have relationships with local property owners and can hook you up with a cheap apartment or something of the like. They might also have good hookups for summer work, and sometimes professors have job opportunities depending on the field. (For example in the sciences, labs are often looking for summer research assistants.)\n\nAlso make sure to talk to your professors, when you're ready, so they understand what you're going through. If they know what's up, and what's taking your time, your grades are less likely to take a hit this semester. On the *flip side,* remember that grades are more important to *staying* in college, and less important to getting a job. Some places will want to see them, especially right out of college, but in a few years the hiring criteria are more \"what are your skills, how did you do at previous jobs, where did you get your degree, do you have any cool awards/honors\" in that order.\n\nAnd finally, use all the resources available to you as a student to help you get through this. You have an RA who you can talk to, who can help you find all the school services you could need; your school probably has a counseling service; you're surrounded by friends and peers at all times; your professors have your best interest and bright future in mind.\n\nOverall, the fact that you're in college can be a big asset to you right now in basically *every* way, and you can take advantage of that!\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, and I wish you the best of luck.",

If you need to take a break from where you\u2019re st and go travel, do it, and return to life as normal, or if you just want to put your head down and stay the course, that\u2019s not a bad idea either. Don\u2019t go buying a house or changing your major though, your head isn\u2019t clear.\n\n\nFor finances. There\u2019s no fines, you can take a minute. We did the funeral plan first. This is the first expensive thing you come across - if it\u2019s just you or a very small crowd and you aren\u2019t attached to full burials I\u2019d suggest a cremation and to spread his ashes somewhere he loved - you can always visit that spot and it saves you thousands. If he left wishes and the finances to cover them, that\u2019s up to you. \n\nStart with the credit beureaus, they\u2019ll have all his liabilities listed. They (the creditors not the reporting agencies)only can pick on the estate, not you. Sue them if they do pick on you. They\u2019ll stop. \n\nGo to where he banked and ask to speak with the branch manager - it might take a couple days to get that appointment. They\u2019re human and may well help you through this. Talk about lofty future education plans then ask that person if they know a lawyer who does pro bono work. This may bet you some good legal advice. They will also be able to give you a good idea of his total assets. \n\nIf he was working he may have had employer paid life insurance. Contact Human Resources right away and let them know. If he was close with his boss you can deliver that personally as well. \n\nIf you want to share what state or country you\u2019re in, maybe the crowd knows of some resources for you. \n\nGo see a counsellor. Grief is a skill and takes practice. Our society has forgotten how to do this and isn\u2019t good at teaching young people anymore. I skipped this step and It fucked me up for years. Do it within this month if you can.",

Find a professor for each, email them/set up a meeting and explain your situation. Could be a wealth of specific advice that you could get for free due to the student/teacher dynamic. \n\nFind the will (assuming he made one) and track down login info/passwords ASAP, and start piecing together his financial life. \n\nWith a will, there may be an executor (a point of contact), he/she would be your first stop in that case. Also, take a candid look at who the executor is, it's similar to power of attorney in that if that individual is dishonest, a lot of what is rightfully yours can be diverted by his/her decisions.\n\nSounds like you're a student, if you have student loans and your parent cosigned, make sure that his passing won't affect your financing because that would be a terrible surprise the next semester that you don't need. Also, talk to your school for financial aid due to your particular situation right now.\n\n",

Even if it feels like your life is just coming crashing down, because I know it does, just stay strong. Even if you may or may not believe so right now, you will get through this and become an even stronger person after you've gotten through this. \n\nAs others have stated before, don't do anything rash, try to live day by day. And most importantly, set aside time so you can properly grief. I can't stress this enough how important it is. Reach out to people that you care about, continous support from friends helped me a lot.

Instead of thinking about the tragedy. Be prepared to cry a lot and don't feel ashamed. The smallest things can trigger it, and it's absolutely okay to tear up. \n\nHang in there, I know you can do it.

I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nMy father passed away about two years ago, so let me share with you some things you might want to be thinking about. \n\n**Ask the Police to Refer You to a Social Worker**\n\nBecause of your age, you're in a unique situation. If I were you, I'd ask the police with whom you've been speaking to refer you to a social worker who could guide you through the various government programs and resources that might be available to you (including those that will help you with the process of his burial). \n\n**Ask Your University for Help**\n\nYou may be able to take advantage of your college's institutional resources. If your school has any kind of student resource or counseling center, use it. Talk to a person. Get an appointment. Depending on your school, you may also want to reach out to the Provost and/or financial aid. \n\n**Reach Out to Family Law Legal Practices**\n\nBecause of your age and situation, you might be able to get a lawyer to help you on a pro bono basis (meaning free to you). A lawyer is going to help you with your father's estate, such as it is, including all his bills and creditors. The social worker I mentioned above might be able to help you with this (if she's good at her job), but if you're not getting much help, you should just start calling different offices to see if someone would be interested in helping you. \n\n**Check With Your Father's Current and Former Employers**\n\nYou'll want to reach out your father's current employer (if he was employed) right away. The human resources (or its equivalent) contact there will let you know if your father had 1) a retirement savings account such as a 401(k) or pension 2) a life insurance policy 3) a death or disability benefit. \n\nDepending on your father's profession and work history, it might be worth checking in with his former employers as well. For example, if he worked for a municipal, state, or federal government agency, he may have unclaimed retirement benefits. \n\n**If Your Father Did Have Life Insurance or Retirement Savings**\n\nKnow that life insurance and retirement savings money is invisible to your father's creditors. Even if you were never listed as a beneficiary, as the sole heir these monies (if they're out there) will come straight to you. They are not considered part of your father's estate, and that means that you won't have to use them to settle your father's debts. \n\nGood luck to you.",

            "comment": "Best advice for resolving debt collectors:\nGet several official copies of the death certificate from \"county vital records\" office. They charge for these unfortunately. I know you will always need a copy for the entirety of your life as things may arise in the future, so never give your last copy out. Start with 3 copies (10 if you can afford it and don't have time to go to vital records) so you can get a feel of what you need to do. \n\nUpon receipt of bills call and state: \n1) he passed 2) there is no will 3) there is no estate 4) ALWAYS work with the same person (get direct line or extension 5)ask what is needed to ABSOLVE the debt (usually its copy of death certificate) ask them to specify if it needs to be a certified copy or just a photo copy as the document costs money. UNDER no circumstance do you pay a cent, it's not your debt to pay your just calling to clear it up for them. Again, never pay anything, you are seeking to absolve. \n  ***I assume you should get a disposable phone or keep his line active for a while so that calls do not interfere with your own life. You don't want them calling your personal phone and affecting your mood. You can handle the bills at your leisure, not theirs. 6) file everything (get one of those larger plastic file fax envelope accordion things, but get the size where full sheets can slide in) take notes with everything you file (date,person, things needed to be done and note when you dropped them on the mail) Organize the filer. 1)Just received/need call 2)called needs work done or follow up) 3) confirmed complete 4) power of attorney 5) death certificates 6) titles/ receipts of assets 7) you may need your birth certificate proving your  relationship on hand. 8) notebook and utensil. Travel with it to appointments!!!! \n\nIn case of life insurance:\nDebt collectors typically CANNOT take life insurance as most agent will ensure that a person was named in the documents not the estate.  However, if the policy turns out to be in the benefit of the \"estate\" they can, but I believe it would need to be proportionally dealt out (like bankruptcy). *out of my scope to advise. I want to state this again, if it turns out YOU are named as the beneficiary it is yours to keep, no one gets it and you do not need to state that you received any to the debt collectors, It's none of their business. \n\nIn the case of debt collectors getting \"estate\" life insurance: they have a small window, something like 6 months to ask to be on the list. If it turns out there is estate life, *I personally would not call anyone back as it would cue them in to file and get on the list.\n\nAny prepaid bills i.e auto insurance:\nCall and cancel the active policies so as to get the largest refund possible. The sooner you call the better because it will be a larger refund!!! But, if you need a car leave it active and drive it!  Insurance and registration  can be renewed by anyone, they don't check to see who is doing it (some would argue this goes against not paying his debts, but a prepaid service is different and we do it for customers all the time who don't even have the $40 to transfer plus registration fees. It gives time! The best soliton is to completely own it, as soon as you can. If there is a car loan on it, that's a different creature as well. At your leisure, you can switch it all to your name. Speak with the local dmv on advise or just sign the title as a gift to you. If you mark it as a gift they will not tax it, they also do not check to see if he actually signed it. My advise here: if your having trouble with getting signed as executor, don't switch the car to your name bc you will have trouble getting the refund that his policy issues. Also, dmv only refunds if you are still in the first year of a 2 year registration so I personally wouldn't switch until the registration is almost out. Or just renew it again, what ever you can afford! There is a $40 plate fee so again switching to your name would cost more money than leaving it in his. If you get pulled over, \"this is my fathers car, he passed away, the estate is in a he process of transferring to me but it takes time\" 100% ok. \n\n\n* Related side note* get an insurance quote in your name and see if you will save money. If you will you will know it's better to take ownership, if you won't save money why switch it? In case of an insurance accident/claim: a policy can not pay if you can't show proof of ownership. The car is old, he likely didn't have comprehensive or collision on it so I don't think that will apply to you. But again, if you keep the bank account active the check would come in his name and u eventually will have power of attorney so you can get the money out. *side note all of this on insurance is skirting the ethical portion. Insurance would like you to switch it immediately, but for your sake and low funds I'm just advising this route because it is NOT illegal to leave it in his name. Some agents would let you slowly take over his existing policy and in that case any accident free discounts would transfer to you. You want to once again sit with the actual agent on his policy and not just one of the workers (as agent can skirt the ethics better with less fear of an issue). It would be done low-key I assume.  Ask the agent about to assign a specific worker for you to deal with. \n\nSell the car: if you don't need it sell it for cash. just sign his name, there is no check at dmv to ensure he sold it. Save the receipt that the dmv give you for turning in the plates!!!!!  that receipt will control the date they can back date the insurance refund to, and then you do not need to rush to get the insurance canceled right away (again at your leisure). Wait to establish control of financial accounts or to be established as executor and then you can ensure the money to you easier. They will have to back date the insurance refund to the date of the plate receipt.  \n\nEdit: if you will be transfering the car over to you: Do not let the insurance lapse without turning in the plates. You can take the plates offf and return them if you are not financially ready to transfer it to your name, BUT if you cause a lapse you can not re-Register the vehicle in your name for a determined amount of days bc the dmv will flag the vin and assume you are trying to dodge an insurance lapse issue of a family member. Call and ask them if there is an exception for your circumstance, but this happens a lot where a sibling tries to register a vehicle into there name and can't bc the suspension comes up. \n\nBank account: \nDo not close all bank accounts. Refund checks will come in his name unless you specify in benefit of estate. If you have them come is his name it is highly likely you can deposit them into his account for him/you. As some point, you can then tell the bank you want the money. If you're  the only child I'm certain the \"state executor is you\"...but this is iffy, especially if he has surviving parents that are alive, but just not in your life. In most cases, power of attorney serves as enough for you to act as executor. If he doesn't have one in place you can get one done, but it requires you to see a judge (cost is low and you definitely do not need a lawyer). *For advise on getting established as the executor ask your personal insurance agent friend. Even if you don't have life's insurance speak with your auto agent. They will want to help you for sake of future business. (If you don't have one I suggest State Farm bc they are local agents who still operate on the slogan of \"keeping it personal\").\n\nIf you don't live near his mailbox or want to save time go online and file and change of address form. The post office will start forwarding his mail to what ever address you choose. I personally wouldn't want them to mail stuff to my home so that I could keep his stuff separate. ( maybe a p.o. box but I don't know if you can do that in your name and get his stuff delivered to it, but I think you can). \n\nConsider establishing residency:\nYou are going to need to think about residency during college breaks/closures. Where will you live? Same place? You will need income regardless of where you live, job? Dormitory living is the more costly expense of college, can you live off campus next semester? The student loans will allow you to draw money to pay for off campus living just as they do for dorms to help you get established living in same town so that you can stay and continue to work during college closures. Loans will also allow you to draw money to use however you need it right now ( BUT I highly advise against that as you are just causing debt for yourself). If you are established living in the basement and you are welcome back there, fine. A job is still essential, work study will not be enough I imagine. \n\nFuneral:\nCremation is the cheapest. There are low cost caskets for cremation, if you ask for even cheaper there are some. I can't see spending $600 on something to just cremate it so go with lowest allowed (if casket is even needed). Your father kept you with him, even when he struggled. I 100% believe he would set religious beliefs aside and ask that you keep your own finances secure and make his death does not give you debt. Seek the aid as suggested by others for financing it free (I don't know how you get them) I once saw an article that if you do not claim the body the city will do a cremation. Just a suggestion. \n\nLow on time. If I think of something I will add an edit.  \n\n***I am not a lawyer, but work for insurance and have seen this many times.

My childhood was rocky at home and my father ended up taking his life when I was 17. My mother had moved away to keep her sanity. I still had a parent alive but she has deep depression and isn't really there so no one was there to help me and family had disowned us due to my father.\n\nI had to quit high school to work full time and pay an apartment. My next years were tough but I grew up real fast and worked my ass off to be the best I could. I went back to high school for adults at 22 and graduated. Then college and got a degree and the rest is history. I have a wife, 2 kids, 100k+ job and a few online businesses for fun. \n\nIt's scary now but keep pushing forward, you will be ok. You will learn to appreciate each accomplishment that you made all by yourself and appreciate your family when you will have one.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone can have an easy ride but it can be used to your advantage because you will know the value of hard work.\n\nKeep your head high.",

Losing parents makes you  grow up quickly, I think at whatever age it happens. I had to handle everything after she died because my brother was mentally unable to, and not physically present. Mourning is different for everyone, and don't ever feel bad about the way you mourn. I know I've been a treasure trove of dead mom jokes, my husband went stoic after his mom died. I do recommend going to theraputic services, I haven't done so and I needed it. Chances are your grief will be complicated, and it's more than okay to admit it.\n\nDon't let anyone try to convince you to spend an arm and a leg on funeral costs, I just cremated my mom (covered through medicaid) and held a wake at a bingo hall (where we used to go play) for my mom, and it was a simple, relatively happy and inexpensive event. My husband's mom died last March, and he got pressured into having an all out funeral with embalming and the like by his family. It wasn't what she wanted, nor was it worth it to him, but to each their own. You should make a gofundme to help with funeral and living costs, you may not get a ton, but people will feel really bad for you and want to throw money at the situation to make it better. Now is not the time to let pride steer, take people at face value on their offerings of help and use it. One of my friends suggested that she could order me a pizza for delivery since she wasn't nearby, and it was honestly great. If slmeone asks how they can help, tell them rdering takeout for you or handling some small task.\n\n If your dad had a facebook, announce his death to his page. You could put it in the newspaper if you wanted, but tbh it's easier to tell a handful of family/friends and ask them to spread the word however they want. If he was employed, call his employer to tell them as well.\n\nContact your professors immediately and let them know what's going on, especially if you're going to be the next of kin acting as executor of his will. It's not a bad idea to seek reasonable accomodation from the school too.\n\nAsk questions before they come up (tbh good advice for all people)- wondering what to do if you're in a car accident? Google it. Considering renting an apartment/getting renter's insurance? Google it.\n\nYour FAFSA amount should increase now to help with school, and you may be able to apply for social welfare.\n\nGood luck, I hope for the best for you.",

If your college (or nearby colleges in the state) has a law faculty you can check there as well and there may be staff who can direct you, or know of lawyers who can help on pro bono basis.\n\nYou can also try to see if there are free legal advice centres in the city.

Colleges have considerable resources available to support their students (for free) during various difficulties and they will be able to do a lot for you.  I'm not based in the US and went to university in the UK, but similar resources will almost certainly be available to you.\n\nThere will be legal and financial support that you can access.  There will also facilities for counseling.  There will likely also be financial support that you can access should you now require it. \n\nThe best thing you can do is to go to Student Services (or whatever your college calls it), explain what has happened and ask what support they can provide you.  I would be amazed if they didn't fall over themselves to provide you with assistance.\n\nAside from the legal and financial issues, do take them up on emotional support - e.g. grief counseling.  I lost my father when I was a student and one of my biggest regrets, 25 years later, is that I didn't seek professional counseling from my university.

There is very little that is truly urgent at the moment. \n\nOne thing that I would recommend to you just to know from the beginning is that you, personally, are not liable for any of your father's debts. His estate is. Your father's estate includes his cash on hand (the maybe $2-$3k you mention), any property he owns (such as the car you mentioned, but also basically everything else he owned, even though it may not be worth much/any money), any life insurance policies (I know you're not sure of those right now), any retirement savings accounts (like a 401k from a job) or any pension accounts (if he worked a job with a pension). Before you inherit anything from your dad, his debts need to be paid, including medical debts (also its fairly likely he may have had some credit card debt, or maybe a car loan?). So while you personally aren't liable for his debts, you don't necessarily get to keep all of his assets when there are debts due. Related to this, if anyone calls you asking for money related to your father's debt, DO NOT PAY IT FROM YOUR OWN MONEY. If they cannot recover from your father's estate, they are SOL. They don't get paid (generally). They cannot collect from you (although they will try). If you end up paying them anything though, they can start to get a legal standing to continue doing so. You don't want that. \n\nThe rest of my advice would be to take some time to grieve, maybe deal with any more immediate death-related decisions (for example, burying or cremating your father - another tip - call around because the pricing on this varies significantly), and then get on to tackling any of the more long-term issues. If you're in college, I presume you have finals coming up shortly. Your dad would UNDOUBTEDLY want you to focus on yourself and your schoolwork right now. Its going to seem really, really difficult, but focus on that first. After your finals, you can spend several weeks really focusing on cleaning up your dad's estate. ",

My condolences, my friend. I hope you get through this and get stuff figured out!\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a professional counselor and, as others have recommended, do that. It's pretty simple but it helps. You could maybe consider putting that money in either a savings account which is always open or a fixed term savings account depending on your situation. If you need to fall back on then I recommend an open saver but if you want some money for the future then maybe consider the latter of the two.",

Counseling and financial advice will be very helpful. I don't know what your loan/grant situation is, but you may immediately qualify for some scholarships, grants, or loan forgiveness. \n  \nIt sounds like you have no siblings, grandparents, aunts or uncles? If so, it will fall on your to be the executor of your father's estate. Otherwise you will need to be in communication with whoever else would take up that roll. Finding any existing will should be your first step. As others have stated, no debt can fall on to you.  Some assets can actually skip debt collection and go to you such as retirement accounts if you are the listed beneficiary. Digging up this information can be difficult, I'm still finding accounts 7 years later.    \n\nOthers have also stated that debt collections will be all over you to try and get money out of you and the estate. Any money that states you as the beneficiary is yours. 401k, IRA, company stock program, etc. Was your father of retirement age? Once bill collectors have taken what was owed from your father's liquid assets (checking, savings, etc), they will ask for a death certificate to close the account and take a loss on their side. This includes vehicle loans, credit cards, etc. If he owns any property, things get more complicated. If you chose to keep the home and the contents, you assume the mortgage payments, etc. The other option is leaving the home in the estate, making mortgage payments from the estate, and selling the home to the estate. Then any proceeds leftover after all debt collection can be distributed to you. As far as any contents of the home, if there are a lot, you may choose to auction, or just take what you want, sell what you can, and donate the rest.\n  \nIf your father didn't have any specific final wishes or a will, then don't go crazy with funeral costs. I'm sure he wouldn't want you to waste the money.  \n\nAgain, sorry for your loss. Let me know if you have more questions.",

In my situation--the funeral parlor of your choosing actually does all the transfer details/paperwork.  You just tell them which morgue.  *Don't feel the need to do the burial option etc unless it is necessary/you can afford it.  Cremation and holding on to the ashes is as option--if only because it may not be wise to spend all that money, at this time.*\n\nI'm really sorry to hear about your Father, it cannot be easy.  Tell the cops your situation and perhaps they can help point you in the right direction or give you tips because they deal with this kind of thing quite a bit.  As others suggested, hit up your school counseling services--be sure you're seeing a *school counselor* not a health care shrink, unless it is part of your tuition.\n\nrooting for you.",

When my dad died, we ended up spending far more than necessary on his funeral because the funeral director took advantage of our grief to convince us that the best way to honor his memory was to spend a lot of money on his funeral. This is pretty typical.\n*As others have mentioned, make sure you gather all the facts so you know exactly where you stand financially now, including any assets and debts. Once you have that, you can make a list of your expenses, your income, any money from the estate, and make a budget. \n*Don't get overwhelmed. Everything will be okay.

I'll offer words on 2 things - about advice itself (you're getting tons of it), and about grief.  \n\n Good Advice feels right - it can feel hard to accept, but it will have a ring of truth to it. Bad advice makes you feel uneasy. Trust your gut. Get people to advise you *who are willing to contradict you*  \n  \n\nOn grieving, There is no wrong way to grieve. Everyone handles loss differently. It's bad enough to carry these feelings, don't pile on a second layer of stress by *blaming yourself* for how you feel. You're right to feel what you feel. There's no timetable, and it takes longer than you think it will. You'll find yourself saying, \"It's been a year (or 2 years..) why can't &lt;x&gt;??  The simple fix for that: Whenever you find yourself attaching a dates to your life, just drop the time part.   \n\nSo instead of \"It's been 3 months and I still haven't sent in the life insurance forms\", just tell yourself \"It's time to send in the insurance forms\".  \n",

Luckily, my mother was there to help me out with things, but I will echo the advice that was already given.\n\nTwo main things that I will suggest.  Seek out legal advice.  There is probably a lawyer who will assist with dealing with your parent's estate.  For my father's estate, he was up to his eyeballs in debt, had very little saved.  The lawyer liquidated all of his assets and then send equal amounts of money to each of the creditors that we could identify.  This included selling vehicles, furniture, etc.  Most of the lawyers will take their fees from liquidated assets.\n\nCreditors will continue to hound you for money on your parent's debts.  I was still getting calls 10 years later, of which I told them to stop contacting me because they weren't getting anything else out of me.  You are NOT RESPONSIBLE for your parent's debts.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nThe second thing and what is probably the most important, get counseling.  I did not do this and went down a three year slippery slope of self-medication that really didn't end until I met my future spouse.  I was the unlucky person who found my father and looking back, I really wish I had sought out counseling.  I've managed to pull my life together, but it was touch and go for awhile.\n\nI honestly wish you all the best as you work through these trying times.  Even in our darkest days, we may find it difficult to see the light, but we must never lose faith that it's still there.",

I had parents and they did nothing in terms of helping me figure things out. In fact they still call and ask me for money.\n\nFinancial wise - stay in school. No one tells the youth of today that school is what is going to provide the foundation of your life. The better you do, the easier shit will be in life. Keep studying no matter what! Even when you are done, if you can, keep getting education. That is if that's what you want. You could pick up a trade  if you need to start working.\n\nFinancially you should wait on anything financial until you are ready. Take and do the things to take care of you right now. Plan the funeral, grieve, and take care of yourself. When you are ready you can put all of this awesome advice to use.\n\nI wish I had a place like this when I was your age, I might have started saving for my future a lot sooner. Shit I am still barely saving but I am investing and using my current money to make me more money.\n\nAnyways listen to these guys. They have been around longer than myself, but I can say that staying in school and taking time for yourself is just as important as how to start your goal to financial security.",

They're a resource and even if you don't know them you also don't know anyone who is giving advice here. There are also academic and career counseling offices at just about every school, they should be able to help too.\n\nAlso make sure your profs know what is happening. This is a major event, it's going to have side effects that can and will spread into school. Let them know and they'll work with you. If they don't go to the department chair.

If nothing else, the worst answer you can get is 'no'. As the old saying goes, if you don't ask, you don't get. I'm truly sorry for all of your losses. I think I speak for everyone on this thread, when I say we are here for you xx",

You can also talk to a school councilor who can help you / teach you how to budget.\n\nYou'll be okay.",

Since your resources are now more precious than ever you should compose a budget and figure out where to trim fat so you can start saving. \n\nThe more you mitigate spending and build good habits the easier it will be for you when you graduate.

            "comment": "My father passed away in December, he told me that he had a will, after digging through everything he had for days... I never found one.  It was a pain in the ass, I had to go to city hall and get a short certificate that named me as the administrator of the estate.  If he has anything, you will need that certificate to get access to it.  People keep saying \"get his credit reports\", to be honest if he owes anything to anyone, you will eventually know, they won't let you forget.  You should take the time now to find out what he actually had, and not worry about what he owed.  You will likely need a short certificate to get access to his bank account, just getting access to that can show you what he owed, potentially what he had, if he was paying life insurance premiums, etc. If you're tech savvy and can figure out ways to access his bank account electronically by enrolling him in online banking, or if you know his or can change his password (if you have access to his email) that can save you headaches now. But you'll eventually need to setup an estate bank account if he indeed does have anything, so you'll still need to go through the pain in the ass stuff.  \n\nThe most grueling process will be dealing with inheritance taxes if he indeed has anything, but if he doesn't and he doesn't have money to cover what he owes, you are not responsible. They will bug you, but they don't know your SSN, the debts won't be tied to you, if there is not money in the estate to cover it, there isn't much they can do. \n\nIn regards to death certificates, I was told to get a bunch, I think I got 10 plus the original and I probably still have 8 or 9 left as many people just needed a copy faxed to them etc.  I'd start with the bank account, selling the car, looking if he had life insurance and just be sure to track every cent you spend.  If there is an inheritance tax you can use any expenses as a deduction to that. \n\nHonestly a lawyer is a great way to go in this sort of situation, but you're 19 and if your father didn't have a lot of money it's likely out of reach.  If you do find out he has life insurance, and there is a lumpsum of cash or assets somewhere... find a good reputable lawyer honestly. \n\nHope any of this helps. ",

Whatever you decide to do be prepared to tell them no. No you don't need fancy handles. No you don't need extra people for the service. If you cremate you don't need an expensive urn. They'll try to upsell you at every point knowing that people don't want to seem cheap right now. Feel free to be cheap since you need to be careful about money. ",

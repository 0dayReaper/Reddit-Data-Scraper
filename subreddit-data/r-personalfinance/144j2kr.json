    "postText": "Hi All,\r  \n\r  \nI'm 25 years old, currently live at home with monthly expenses of about $1k-$1.5k (I pay my dad a small amount to help out with mortgage). I earn about $95k total per year and have been maxing out my Roth IRA and 401k so far. I get about $3750 per month after taxes and 401k. I also have $10k emergency savings in an I-bond (I bought it last year when they were giving 9 or 10% interest). I had been saving the money to purchase a house, but I want to finish grad school before I buy one. (My grad school cost is next to nothing due to my company helping out, and me paying it as I go). I have another $6k-$8k in bank accounts/crypto apps as well and don't have any debt. So I wanted to ask what to do with this money as its been growing in a 4% HYSA. Is there something better I could do with it?",

            "comment": "1. Grow your Emergency Fund for 3-6 months of EXPECTED expenses, should you move out of your dad's house and into your own. It's okay to keep some money in an I-bond, but you also need part of it to be liquid, too, such that you can get immediate access to it without any kind of penalty. Perhaps a HYSA?\n2. Start a separate bucket for at least a 20% downpayment on your house (roughly, of course). Keep it in something short term (like a HYSA, CD, etc.). If you don't need it for more than 5+ years from now, see number 3.\n3. Invest the rest into a taxable brokerage account.",

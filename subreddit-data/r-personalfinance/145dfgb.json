    "postText": "My grandfather is 94 years old and has been expressing that he would like one of the grandchildren to buy his house. I would love to have the house and really want to keep it in the family, but I just don't understand why I should buy it v. just inheriting it. The house has been paid off for decades and he is in great health for his age and still very independent so obviously even if one of us purchased the home we would want him to remain living there for the rest of his days. \n\nCan someone ELI5 the differences between buying v. inheriting?

Because a house doesn't divide easily among his heirs.  If one person solely inherits the house, then the other heirs may want/need to be 'bought out' of their inheritance share.",

We help him with the mowing and property maintenance, and he has a family friend come and do light cleaning once every other week. Otherwise, the place is tip top. He's ex-military so he can't stand a mess. Haha. Recently he had to have a procedure and was on bed rest restriction and he told me he hated it and he just wanted to go do something. A lot of his happiness comes from being active.",

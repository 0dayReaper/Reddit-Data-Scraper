    "postText": "I recently got my first debit card from Wells Fargo and so far all is good. However I'm having a problem with purchasing items online. \nKeep getting \"Your payment was not authorized. Please double check your information or contact your payment provider.\"\n\nDid I forget to activate something? I'm using the same address of billing with what I used with the card when I opened it?\n\nCan anyone help me why it won't allow me to buy anything online?",

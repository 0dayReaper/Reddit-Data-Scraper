    "postText": "For background, I use an online bank for standard checking and savings. I have a debit card connected to the checking account, but never use it. I don't keep it in my wallet - I keep it at home in a safe place, mostly in case of emergency. I've never used it for online purchases or at an ATM. The online bank I use lets me \"auto-decline\" certain purchases made with the debit card, and I've marked almost all transaction types (including online purchases) as \"decline.\" I live alone. I almost always use credit cards for purchases when possible.\n\nI purchased a new (advertised as new, though an older model) iPhone on eBay a couple months ago (the box was not sealed, but I did set it up starting from the Hello screen). Just in case I ever need it in the future, I added $100 to Apple Cash using the debit card, then deleted the debit card from Apple Wallet. This was on April 6.\n\nOn June 7, I get a notification that 2 online transactions have been declined from \"Amazon Prime\" - one for $1.42 and the other for $1.41. These look like some of those small, \"test\" charges they try before they charge a large fraud purchase. I cancelled my Amazon Prime account several months ago and I've never used the debit card on Amazon (or any other website either).\n\nI have locked my debit card through the bank's website and plan to cancel it and request a new one. I'm so glad I went through the debit card management options on the website so that I don't have to deal with getting a big charge reversed.\n\nMostly, I'm just at a loss as to how someone could have obtained my debit card info despite my minimal use of it. Has anyone else had this type of thing happen after adding a card to Apple Wallet? That's the only thing I can remember using it for and although my memory is not perfect, it's the only  transaction on the list of debit card transactions, other than the Amazon ones. Is there any other way someone could have gotten my info that I'm not thinking of? Should I trash this phone and get a new one? I consider myself somewhat tech savvy and I try to stay aware of different methods of scamming/hacking/stealing, but I'm sure there are many out there that I've not heard of. Or maybe I'm over-thinking this?",

They definitely wouldn't test the card because they know the card number is good. Based on what the industry has seen, my guess is an enumeration attack exploiting card on file.",

Dang, it sounds like there's really nothing we can do to prevent this type of fraud either, other than blocking online purchases like I did with this card, but it would be unrealistic to do that with all cards, all the time. I'm not even sure getting a new card will be wildly beneficial if this is the case, but I'll do it anyway in case there was some exposure/purchase that I just don't remember. Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it!",

Unfortunately, there are ones that get through, no matter the size of the bank. If actual fraud charges posted, you should be getting a new card anyways. This especially sucks as an employee explaining how this happens when the customer hasn't even used the card once. It doesn't provide confidence in the customer to stay with the bank. Hope your weekend goes better!",

    "postText": "For instance my monthly limit is $1667.  But my expenses are nearly the same amount, due to the $0.665 IRS deduction for mileage(I am delivery driver for amazon flex).\n\nSo, it is a very minimal profit business.  Does this mean that I can only have $1677 in REVENUE per month, even if i am making next to nothing?  That would seem like a pretty massive penalty for being self employed.  Or can I safely make up to $1677 a month in profits just like an employee can?",

    "postText": "I just won a contest with a prize valued at around $15,000 (it's an all expenses paid fly fishing trip to Montana). What will my taxes ramifications be for next years filing? I doubt that this will push me into a higher tax bracket, but I think that I will have to count the value of the winnings as income. I assume that this would be just like winning money at a casino. I just want to save enough money, so I don't have an IRS bill that I have to struggle to pay next April.",

            "comment": "Congratulations.  It sounds like a whole lot of fun.  Here is a quick-and-dirty way to prepare for your tax liability.  If you start putting a little money away each month you should be ok.  \n\nOther than the $15,000, do you expect to earn a lot more from work in 2023?  How did you prepare your taxes in 2022 (tax software? H&amp;R Block?)?  Go back to wherever you got your taxes done this year and figure out how much your taxes would have gone up if you earned an extra $15,000 + whatever extra you will earn this year.  The extra bit can be $0 if you aren\u2019t likely to earn a lot more in 2023.  \n\nSo to be clear, if you prepared your own taxes, then go back and reopen the 2022 tax program and rerun it by adding another $15,000.  Look at what it shows your new total federal tax liability.  Likewise if you went to H&amp;R Block or whomever before, go back and have them run this same case.  \n\nOnce you do this you should see a number for your total federal tax liability.  Then figure how much has been withheld in federal taxes for 2023 already.  Then figure out how much more will be withheld for the rest of the year.  Add these two numbers, and that equals your 2023 withholdings.  Subtract this withholding number from the projected tax liability and that number is a good approximation of the extra you will owe for 2023. \n\nThis is a quick-and-dirty method.  You might add another 10% just to be sure.  \n\nIf you did go to H&amp;R Block or whomever for 2022, you can just ask them to run an estimated 2023 tax liability for you with the extra $15,000.  They will do the work I\u2019ve described above for you.  It might cost you a few bucks, but it is well worth it.  They can also advise you if it would be wise to make estimated tax payments.",

Off the top of my head, I figure I'm going need to have around $3000 saved (around 20% of the prize's worth) and that should put me in the ballpark, so the bite won't be too bad come next year. Shit, most of the prize is going to a lodge that's  over $1,000 a night. I'd never spend that kind of money for fishing - I don't care how good it is. But it's pay the taxes or get nothing. Hopefully the weather is good.",

It's at least worth asking.\n\nIf you can't afford the taxes, you might just have to turn down the prize altogether.",

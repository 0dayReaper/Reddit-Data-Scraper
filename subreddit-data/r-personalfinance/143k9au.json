What are some tips pr advice for saving up my money? I'm planning on moving out next year so I definitely need to do better with money.",

            "comment": "So first off, you got a great mindset and are way ahead of the game.\n\nBecause you\u2019re a minor your options are limited, however, you can do some things ahead of time so you can hit the ground running next year as soon as you turn 18.  My recommendations.\n\n1:Ask your parents to help you set up a second checking account. Use that as your \u201csavings\u201d account. Pull what you want to save each pay check and plot it in there.  Make sure it\u2019s a fee free account. Cut up the debit card.  Just transfer and check the account once a month to make sure nothing is spent. Be ready to transfer ALL savings in both accounts to a credit union when you turn 18.  Your goal over the next year should be to have enough in the second account to pay for your budget for 6 months.  Everything.   Do this first so in case you do lose your job, you have 6 months to find another.  If your overall bills increase, you need to increase this emergency savings fund to cover the new expenses.\n\n2:Make a budget.  Learning how to make and stick to a budget takes practice.  Lots of people say it\u2019s JUST about discipline, however, as someone who grew up a poor person, I call BS. It takes years to understand how your personal budget works and everyone is different. I have hobbies and they are pretty expensive (Warhammer, video games, travel).  I tried to budget to limit that stuff to such a degree that I would finally \u201cbreak\u201d and overspend when I got a paycheck with a lot of overtime or a bonus.  I restructured my budget that allowed me to spend on my hobbies, but not overspend. I gave myself just enough that I could still enjoy them.  What did i give up? Ordering food.  I found out that by cooking at home I was saving a ton and I was never a big fast food person anyway.\n\nWhen learning what budget works for you, you gotta sit down each month and go over what you spent your money on.  Literally re-do your budget, every month, for the next year.  You will find out what your actual spending habits are, what you need work on, what you\u2019re doing great at, and how to save short term (tune up for your car) medium term (beach week for your HS graduation), and long term (Roth IRA).  \n\n3:Don\u2019t talk about your savings with your family and friends right now.  If you have an older adult or family member that is finically rock solid that you trust and you don\u2019t split any expenses with, ask them and ask them to keep it quite. I have a lot of cousins your age. You\u2019re super young and when other HS kids or even adults find out you have 2 grand plus in savings you\u2019re are gonna start hearing \u201cI know you have money, just pitch in\u201d, \u201cyou can afford it, you don\u2019t have any REAL bills\u201d or even \u201cbecause you make x now we are gonna charge y\u201d.  It\u2019s shitty, but it\u2019s true.\n\n5:Stay TF away from credit cards right now.  At your income level, you should not be doing fuck all on credit.  Credit cards come later, much later, when you have a solid budget and are making enough to be independent  of family.\n\n4:To prep moving forward, look into how the following work:\n\nRoth IRA\n\nTraditional IRA\n\nMutual Fund\n\n401k\n\nCD\u2019s\n\nBonds \n\nHaving even a basic knowledge base of these can help you immediately roll into what type of vehicles you want your savings to be in.\n\nIf ya got any questions feel free to reach out.",

                    "comment": "Good advice overall. However, the op needs at least one credit card. They should use it at least once a month to buy a candy bar and then pay it off each month. They have to start building credit history and a good credit score now so that when they move out they will be able to get an apartment. You have to have a credit score established these days to do practically anything. It\u2019s essential. My daughter is 23 and she has a credit score of 800 because she knows how to manage her money and how to use credit cards strategically. She just bought her first house because her credit score is good and she knows how to manage money. The OP should consider getting a secured credit card from their bank to help them establish a credit score.",

Like a credit union\u2026\n\nThen I would make a budget of all your monthly expenses so you have a better idea of what you have to work with.  Say for instance, you don\u2019t have monthly car repairs, but if you average it out to $100 a month, then you know and have money saved for when you do need it.\n\nI think you should be able to save around 250-500 a month.",

She will go to prison and Chase will get most of that money back. Chase has never had issues with individual checking/savings accounts. They could lose way more than $175m on a bad investment and it would have ZERO impact on their ability to fulfill withdrawals. \n\nCredit unions are nice, though.",

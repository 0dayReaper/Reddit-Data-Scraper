    "postText": "Hey Reddit fam!\nMy partner and I have been saving up money for a home for a while now. We also are looking to get a new car here soon. We\u2019ve heard several times from different sources that we need credit history if we are planning to eventually get a mortgage. We have more than enough to pay cash for the car. Saving money by not having to pay a stupid amount of interest on a car loan has always been a priority all though due to continually paying cash for large ticket purchases has made it so we have virtually no credit history other than credit cards. \n\nIt basically seems like you have to \u201cbuy\u201d credit history from the interest on loans if we want to have any history in getting approved for a mortgage. I\u2019ve considered getting a small loan for the car and pay mostly cash.\n\nSo essentially my questions are:\n\nHow important is credit history for a mortgage?\n\nWhat do you guys advise us to do with this purchase of a car to help set yourself up in preparation of getting a mortgage?\n\nIf I should get a loan for the car, how small can it be to be considered appropriate credit history?\n\nAlso, how soon can I pay that loan off for it to be considered appropriate history to avoid paying too much in interest?\n\nLove you guys, any advice is much appreciated!",

They also look for income level, employment history, oustanding debt, down payment, etc. So even if your credit history is short you can still compensate for it with the other metrics.",

You could find bargain in the future. Continue stacking cash in a HYSA for your down payment. And if you think you have enough for a down payment, max out your retirement accounts (401K, Roth IRA, HSA).",

This includes things like monthly rent and utilities. I also breakdown any yearly charges into each month. \n\nI have Mint setup with my bank and all credit cards. I use one primary card for daily and monthly charges. But I have a second that I use for big purchases. I\u2019ve been able to pay them to zero each month. But I barely break even each month. \n\nI have a budget setup in Mint for food, gas, household spending. Food is any grocery or dinner out. Gas is obviously for the car. Household is for things like soap, a bookcase, bath towels, anything for my apartment that\u2019s not edible. \n\nI don\u2019t splurge on anything except a book each month. I just treated myself to a mountain but I set money aside for that. Even though I set aside money for eating out, I only eat out twice a month and it\u2019s usually Applebee\u2019s. \n\nWhere it looks like I keep going over is with my food and grocery budget. I\u2019m single. My child stays with me half of the month. But I keep blowing my food budget out of the water. \n\nSo my question is. How do I manage this??\n\nI guess I just order food and not look at where I am to budget until later in the month or when it\u2019s time to pay credit cards. What happens if you are out of budget and out of food?\n\nDoes everyone look at their budget weekly? Do you look at your budget before you buy groceries? How do you spread variable expenses out over the month?\n\nI think I\u2019m missing the part on how to execute a budget on variable expenses. \n\nCan someone explain what their day, week, month look like when it comes to tracking to their budget?\n\nThis might sound like a simple concept but I\u2019m not getting the execution part. I have my money in buckets but the variable buckets is something I can\u2019t figure out how to manage daily. \n\nThanks!",

In 4 years, my grocery budget went up 20%, and my overall food budget up \\~22%. For food, all you can do is try to eat in more, waste less, cook more veggies/cheap starches and fewer processed and novelty foods. The good news is, according to the FAO food price index, things are starting to level off.\n\nI strongly recommend spinning off sub-budgets for food, especially for going out/ordering in and if you buy alcohol regularly.\n\nTracking what you spend is definitely the first big hurdle. Do it for a few months, and you start to see trends. Do it a few months more, and you start to see the spots you underfunded or overlooked (car repairs, home repairs, emergency travel, medical expenses, electronics and furniture). You have to start with estimates, but eventually, those once-a-quarter to once-every-couple-years expenses will start to show up, and you'll know what to expect for them year to year or the types of variations to expect, but in the meantime, your emergency fund will be taking hits here and there until you sort it out.\n\nAccept that your buckets may need to be bigger from time to time and carry over surpluses/deficits from month to month ... if you are consistently running a deficit in one category, make it bigger, if you are consistently running a surplus and aren't saving for something in particular, make that bucket a little smaller. I use $25 increments for master categories and $10 increments for sub-categories.\n\nSmoothing out budgets month to month is easily the hardest part of getting your money to work for you, but the only way to save is to put every dollar to work.",

Maybe you can make adjustments to how you eat to make the groceries more affordable once you see where the money is going.\n\nInflation is killing my food budget, too, so cheers to this. \n\nAlso, is there a less expensive grocery store you could go to to save the cash?

Instead of $200 a month, your actual food budget needs to be set at $300 (for example).  \n\nYou also need to be more mindful of your spending.  That means lots of meal prepping and food planning.  No more buying groceries willy nilly and deciding later what to make of it.  If it's not on the list, don't put it in the cart.  Buy dry foods in bulk, learn to freeze anything you can't eat before spoiling.  \n\nI really love Budget Bytes, lots of options for every meal of the day.",

If you are apensing more on grocery than you budget, double check what you are buying, and if it's acceptable then you need to budget more.\n\nGenerally for food its either spending on the wrong things or simply things are more expensive and you need to adjust your budget accordingly.",

            "comment": "What helped me stop food waste was\n\n1: planning my meals out for 2-3 days. Make the meals simple and just deal with not having \u201cfresh cilantro\u201d for my taco tuesdays.  Not complex, like spaghetti for dinner, ham and cheese sandwich for lunch w baby carrots, jelly toast and coffee for breakfast.  I go to the store in the afternoon to pick up spaghetti sauce, ham, a loaf of bread, and some ground beef (If i don\u2019t have any frozen) for meatballs.  I already have noodles, seasonings, jelly, and coffee at home (see part two).  That\u2019s like 20 bucks for 3 days of food, 12/13 bucks if I already have the ground beef.\n\n2: going to the grocery store mon, wednesday, and friday, every week and purchasing what I am going eat and that\u2019s it.  I did add in about 50$ per week for two months for long term hold items such as seasonings, flour, oil.  After about two months I no longer need to buy these items if a recipe calls for it. \n\n3:No snack items, no soda, just actual food.  I do like flavor, so I get a bottle of Mio once a week, but usually just stick to ice water and coffee in the AM.\n\n4:I straight up deleted food order apps like grub hub and door dash.  I only allow myself to get restaurant food 4 times a month and I get my ass up and go get it.  It turns a 60$ uber eats order into 15 bucks. Plus, it puts another barrier to taking the easy option. Drive all the way to outback, wait for my order, pay, the. drive alll the way back? Or I\u2019m already off the couch, I have noodles, egg, bacon, and seasoning, let\u2019s do a quick carbonara with a serving of Ice cream for dessert. 20 min tops.\n\n 5: This one took a while, but learning portion sizes.  As an American, I love my waffle house all star special.  Without butter, jelly, syrup or a drink, it\u2019s 70% of calories needed for the day.  I was used to over eating because of american portion sizes.  It costs a lot of money to eat that much food.  I don\u2019t really look at calories, I started to look at portion size and if it says a cup, I eat a cup for that meal.  It took about a month before my body wasn\u2019t used to eating so much more than it needed.  After that, wanting snacks kinda disappeared.  Eating a 12 ounce steak in one sitting is uncomfortable physically to do (a portion of red meat is about 4oz).  I get full way faster and eat way less.  Before anyone says anything, I could give a shit about eating healthy or whatever.  The portioning thing is 100% about saving money.\n\n6: Cook with your kid when you have them if you can. Do the same planning for their meals and get the groceries right before or after you pick them up.  50 bucks 2x a month for home cooked meals for you and the kid is plenty to have some great food.\n\nMy food budget is about 400-450 a month for me and my partner, this includes eating out as we have a date night at least once a month. Without the date night it\u2019s about 350-400. We cook at home almost every day.",

To note: I like to eat out, we have the money so that's ok, and it's one of the only things we splurge on\n\nI have two separate line items for food. One for groceries, one for eating out, and they have their own budget amount set. Eating out is ANYTHING that wasn't bought at the grocery store, so that quick trip to 7-11, the day I forgot lunch, grabbing ice cream one night etc..) my budget is monthly, but I only grocery shop 1/week. So if my overall grocery budget is 800, then I know I have 200/wk. (these are not my real numbers just fyi, just makes for easy math) then if my monthly eating out is 400, I know weekly I can spend 100. \n\nIm good at keeping track of it in my head each week. But, I will normally sit down once a week and enter all my expenditures into my excel sheet budget and asses where I am. \n\nAnd to echo what others have said food/groceries have really increased lately. About 2 months ago we had to increase our food budget to accommodate new prices. (In our case we had the money for this. You may need to reduce what you buy, or change where you buy, or change the type of food.)",

            "comment": "With food/grocery budget give this a shot - it\u2019s something I started doing when trying to lose weight a few years back, but it really wrangled in the grocery bill too- get a small dry erase board or use a piece of paper etc. and each week, plan out your dinners for the following week, and if you want to have Applebee\u2019s one night or order in Chinese, plan it.\n\nThen, based on your menu, make up your grocery list. If possible, itemize things together in the store - i.e. keep all the produce in same area of list, frozen food together, etc.  It can help keep you from winding down isles you don\u2019t need to, and prevent picking up a tub or 2 of ice cream that\u2019s on sale. \n\nIf you make an extra serving each meal or 2-3 extra of one early in the week to give you left overs, you cut out half the stuff you need for lunches too, and by virtue of planning ahead, you\u2019ll save some cash.  \n\nIt\u2019s not the end-all-be-all solution to your problem, but it is a small easy step to get you going in the right direction.\n\nEdit to add: for \u201csplurge\u201d items etc.: give yourself time to sleep on it.  Once you\u2019ve found something you want to splurge on - whether $20 or $200, give it a few days or a week or two keeping going with what you\u2019ve currently got, and see if you REALLY still want that item as much as you\u2019d thought initially.",

I use YNAB to track my budget, but you can probably do something similar in mint. \n\nIf you assign $200 to food every month, then whenever you buy food you should assign it to your food budget, and the value should deduct from the budget. So if you get halfway through the month and have no money for food, you know your budget isn\u2019t working. Then you need to take money from somewhere else. Did you budget some money for savings? Maybe take it from there since you\u2019re not really saving. Maybe take it from your \u2018fun money\u2019 budget. Wherever it comes from, you need to see the impact that your choices make.\n\nThis is a live budget, and it\u2019s the only real way to make it work IME. It forces you to make decisions and understand the consequences of your actions. Without it your budget is basically a guesstimate.",

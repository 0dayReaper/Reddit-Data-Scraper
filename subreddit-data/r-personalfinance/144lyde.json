    "postText": "Hi everyone! Hoping to bounce some ideas off y'all. My husband and I are 28 and we just bought a house in October and had our first baby. Our mortgage is $2k per month, but my MIL lives in our converted garage and pays us rent, so we pay 1.5k per month. I make about 4k per month after taxes, and my husband makes about 2k per month, but he will probably make about half that as he plans on going to part time later in the year to care for our daughter. We have 20k in a HYSA, ~30k in my pension, and then he has a 401(k) but I don't think there's a lot in there. We just started a 529 for our baby. We have no car loans, student loans, credit card debt, etc, just our mortgage. \n\nWe both have to commute to work. I have to drive to work three or four days per week and he has to drive in four days per week. We have a pretty reliable 2016 Kia Soul, but my problem is my 1992 Ford Ranger. I love my truck for sentimental reasons (it was my late favorite Aunt's) and I've kept it in really good shape. For a thirty year old truck it's pretty great and has been my daily driver. Late last year my transmission went out and even though it was probably a bad financial decision, I replaced it. So, I've sunk a lot of money into it. I'm worried my sentimental love for it might be clouding my judgement. \n\nThis week my truck had to go to the mechanic again. The check engine light was on, the power steering pump is going out, etc. All in all they quoted me 2k to fix what it needs. I did the bare minimum to get the light off and told them I'd think about the rest. So, I'm thinking. Do I continue to pour money into it? Maybe at this age it shouldn't be my daily driver. It's not the safest vehicle, I don't want to put my baby into it. And maybe it's not the best financial decision to keep driving it.\n\nI was thinking about getting a used car, maybe in the 10k range. Just something in good shape and reliable that I can put my baby in. I don't really want to go to a dealership. I was thinking I'd do a private sale and then have a mechanic look at it before I buy. That would leave us ~10k in our HYSA, depending on the price of the car.. I'm concerned that that's not a very large emergency fund. We just replaced our AC in our home  I think we will need to replace the water heater in the next year, and the roof maybe in 5-10 years. Other than that I don't anticipate major house expenses soon, but expect the unexpected right? And with a new baby I don't know what to expect. I also know it's not a great time to buy a used car, but I'm not sure it's going to get any better.\n\nAnd then I'm left with the decision of what to do with my truck, since the thought of getting rid of it entirely gives me anxiety, but I guess that's a separate problem. Any other ideas that I haven't thought of yet? Advice? Thank you guys, I know this was a lot of reading! Writing it all out helps me think about it too.",

I also don't really want to drive it until it breaks down and then not fix it. I don't know. The thought of it not being taken care of is upsetting. I'm a mess. Maybe I should try therapy first lol.",

For reference I bought a 2022 sonata for all of 10k more but 0 miles and the warranty. \n\nUsed car prices are still high for no good reason. If you can wait it out, it might cool down by fall but that\u2019s my guess. \n\nAnother place you could check would be Facebook marketplace, you can get a full history from people telling you about the car. The downside to that is if you wanted some sort of protection like you\u2019d get with a CPO. \n\nAlso depends how new (to you) of a car you want. Used cars by me for $10k are mid-late 2000\u2019s.",

I just don't want to wait so long that I get in a positions where now I'm desperate and need a vehicle. I have been looking on Facebook Marketplace, but I'd like to have something 2016 or newerish and there aren't a lot in that price range for sure. Thank you for your reply!",

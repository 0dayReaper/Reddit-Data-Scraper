    "postText": "This may be a very elementary question, but how does opening a new credit card work?\n\nI have a banking account at Wells Fargo and have had their \"platinum card\" for a few years now. I have a 750+ credit score. I want to get the American Express gold card because of my frequency in everyday spending (restaurants/groceries) with infrequent flight. My wife has the Sapphire Reserve so that is also our travel card. \n\nAnyway, if I use the American Express exclusively, am I still able to keep my Wells Fargo card? Do I need to cancel it? What happens to my credit score, does that just link to all my credit cards in general?Should I keep my Wells Fargo card since it is my first and only credit card? \n\nFinally, what if I change banks in the future? That would mean I would need to close my Wells Fargo, but my American Express would continue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone could just give me a crash course on all things credit cards, that would be super helpful!",

There is also not a defined limit, it is dynamic based on your usage, and utilization is not reported. There are probably a few other things I am missing.\n\n&gt;Should I keep my Wells Fargo card since it is my first and only credit card?\n\nAverage account age is a credit score factor. This is your only account and oldest so closing it would drop the score a lot. You will see a temporary drop opening the second but it will eventually go back up to and beyond what it is at currently.\n\n&gt;Finally, what if I change banks in the future? That would mean I would need to close my Wells Fargo, but my American Express would continue.\n\nBoth would continue so long as you kept both credit cards open. You don't need a WF bank account to keep a WF credit card active. The credit card is it's own account.",

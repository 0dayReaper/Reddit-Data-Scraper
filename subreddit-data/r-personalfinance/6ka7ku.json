    "postText": "You get married and then it\u2019s living happily ever after, right? Well...\n\nA few months after we were married, my wife came home from Target with a couple of large shopping bags.\n\n*\u201cWhat did you buy this time?!\u201d*\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t say that out loud. I\u2019m not *that* stupid. \n\nBut the thought did run through my mind, and it concerned me.\n\nWhy was I so upset over a trip to Target? I love Allison! I trust her, and I know she\u2019s responsible. \n\nShe didn\u2019t come home with a new car. She didn\u2019t gamble away all our savings. So what\u2019s the big deal?\n\nThen it hit me. \n\n**I couldn\u2019t answer the question, \u201cAre we okay?\u201d**\n\nWe were married and happy except when it came to money. Every day, my wife used *her* money from *her* bank accounts, and I was using *my* money with *my* credit cards. \n\nI realized that we were still paying the bills and shopping like we were roommates rather than like a team or a family.\n\nAnd as I thought more about it, I discovered that how we used money was only *part* of the problem.\n\nAt the time, I had just started a career as a financial advisor, and I was being paid with a combination of a fixed salary and commission. The amount I was making was changing every month.\n\n[EDIT: I left the financial advising career about 4 years ago. Wasn't for me.]\n\nAllison had a stable job, but her hourly rate was low. Plus, her job was centered around tourism, so the number of hours she worked went up in the summer and dropped in the winter.\n\nAt any given moment, we had no idea if we were spending ourselves into a hole or climbing out of it.\n\nWe could compare how much we were charging on our credit cards and how much money was in our bank accounts, but that got complicated. \n\nWe had 8 accounts at 5 different banks. Answering the question, \u201cAre we okay?\u201d took a shit-ton longer than it needed to.\n\nAllison and I weren\u2019t working or planning together when it came to money, and I wanted to make a change.\n\nAll I wanted was to answer the question, \u201cAre we okay?\u201d without getting a degree in Accounting.\n\n**We learned how to handle money as separate people.**\n\nBefore getting married, Allison and I really were separate people.\n\nWe both had savings accounts, checking accounts, and credit cards to manage. We learned how to pay bills in our own apartments with our own roommates (who were also our groomsmen and bride\u2019s maids).\n\nAllison and I ended up moving in together for the summer right before we got married, so we were--from a legal standpoint--roommates rather than a family. We got used to paying the bills and shopping as separate people.\n\nLooking back, combining our lives and becoming a family needed to happen. We realize now that this moment was inevitable, but no one ever taught us how.\n\n**We were responsible as individuals, but not as a couple.**\n\nI figured that if we didn\u2019t start working together with our money, the \u201cTarget incident\u201d would just get worse.\n\n* If I needed a new suit for work, could we actually afford it?\n* What happens when we want to go on vacation?\n* Would Allison start to resent me for spending a lot of money on craft beer?\n* Would I start resenting Allison for buying another purse?\n* What if we go further and further into debt without knowing it?\n* What if we want to buy a house?\n\nI love my wife, and I trust her. But the way we were going, I didn\u2019t trust *us*.\n\n**No one ever taught us how to handle money as a team.**\n\nNo one ever taught me how to handle money as a spouse. Fortunately, I have great parents that I got to watch, and I learned what a great marriage could be. But they never talked about money around me.\n\nIn high school and college, I learned how to balance my checkbook, use a credit card, and pay my bills. But it\u2019s easy to make decisions when I don\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s opinion or permission.\n\nAllison and I needed to do something different, and it was up to us to change.\n\n**We needed to find some help.**\n\nI was on edge to begin with. Trying to network, gain clients, and work long hours already had me stressed out. Worrying about my clients\u2019 money didn\u2019t leave much energy at the end of the day to take care of our money.\n\nAny time we needed to go shopping was stressful. Hanging out with friends made me feel guilty. We live in Florida so of course we like to go to Orlando (*\u201cSea World...Disney...putt-putt golfing.\u201d*).\n\nI wanted to worry a lot less about money, have some fun, and not ruin our marriage in the process.\n\nIt was time to find some help.\n\n**What were the problems we needed to solve?**\n\nAllison and I already worked well as a team. We were both responsible, but we had separate financial lives that needed to be combined somehow.\n\nI realized that the three basic problems we needed to solve were:\n* How do we see all of our money in one place so we don\u2019t miss anything?\n* How can we manage day-to-day decisions without nagging each other?\n* How do we financially and emotionally support each other in our goals and dreams?\n\nThis took some time to figure out.\n\n**Step 1: See everything in one place.**\n\nThe first thing we did was to get everything into one place. I had been using the app, Mint, for years to help track my own stuff. So we decided to start a new account. [EDIT: I took out the link for Mint to help out with the thumbnail issue. I'm guessing you can find the app just fine without it.]\n\n[EDIT: I am not an employee of Mint, nor am I being paid by them. I'm just a fan, and the app has worked well for me. The comments on this post also strongly suggest (but are not limited to) YNAB, Good Budget, Personal Capital, EveryDollar, Mvelopes, and Quicken. You could also use Excel, Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or any other spreadsheet software you are comfortable with to budget and keep track of your finances.]\n\n* Every savings account.\n* Every checking account.\n* All the credit cards.\n* Student loans.\n* Car loans.\n* Every transaction.\n* Updated automatically.\n* All in one spot!\n\nThe clouds parted and the angels sang.\n\nWe both had access to see everything at any moment on a computer or our phones.\n\n**Step 2: Give each other permission to spend money.**\n\nThe next step was to start budgeting together, and I had to talk Allison into this. She had some valid concerns, and it all started with toothpaste.\n\nSince I\u2019m a detail-oriented person, I was gung-ho about budgeting and tracking our money. I love it when everything works together perfectly. Whereas Allison has more of a \u201cgood enough\u201d personality. She was happy as long as we were staying out of trouble.\n\nSo when I started to talk about budgeting, one of Allison\u2019s first questions was, \u201cIf we spend our budget for toiletries and we need toothpaste, I can\u2019t go out and buy more toothpaste?\u201d\n\nIt was a good question, and I didn\u2019t have the answer right away. Over time, we\u2019ve learned how to budget each month without making the budget set in stone. It\u2019s flexible, and when we need to change it...we change it. Toothpaste for days!\n\nAllison also asked, \u201cAnd what if we want to go shopping on our own? Do we need to give each other permission?\u201d\n\nThe solution here was to budget fun money for each other. Every month, Allison gets some money that she gets to do whatever she wants with. And every month, I get some money that I get to do whatever I want with. Sometimes we overspend our fun money amounts (okay, honestly...it\u2019s usually me), but we make it work out.\n\n[EDIT: We also have an \"Entertainment\" fund in our budget every month, which is for anything we do together. You could call it \"Date Night\" money, too.]\n\nAfter making a lot of mistakes, hitting road bumps, finding solutions, and practicing, our monthly budgeting hasn\u2019t caused any fights or headaches....for years.\n\n**Step 3: Decide what we want, together.**\n\nWhen it came to our goals and dreams, we tried a formal system of tracking what we wanted. But it didn\u2019t really work out. It was too much for us as a couple.\n\nOur bigger goals like an emergency fund, retirement, and debt took some time, but those goals take *months* or *years* or *decades* to accomplish. Once we set the plan, there was no need for a conversation every month.\n\nFor the shorter-term ideas, we developed a habit of asking each other, \u201cWhat do you want this month?\u201d \n\nSometimes I want new running shoes. Sometimes Allison wants to throw a party at our house for friends. And sometimes we both want a new dining room table.\n\nIn the end, we just wait until an idea pops into our mind (*\u201cIs it time to go back to Disney World?\u201d*), and we decide if we can afford it now or we need to save up. And then put it in the budget.\n\nIt\u2019s flexible, and it works for us.\n\n**I calmed down...fast!**\n\nAfter all our financial information was in one spot, I immediately calmed down. \n\nI had one number that showed me how much combined money we had in \u201cthe bank\u201d and one number of how much we had charged on the credit cards.\n\nOne number minus the other gave me my answer. We were okay.\n\nAfter we started to budget, seeing a Target bag (or any other shopping bag) hasn\u2019t bothered me since.\n\n**We never fight about money.**\n\nAllison and I have had a lot of fun with friends, visited family, and had wonderful vacations. But we have made a lot of mistakes and have had to deal with a bunch of emergencies.\n\nWe talk, discuss, and decide. But we don\u2019t fight.\n-------\nIf you want to ask a question or have me dive deeper into anything, let me know in the comments. I'll respond as soon as possible.\n\n[EDIT: Wow!! Everyone, thank you for the wonderful stories, comments and questions! I had no idea this was going to make such an impact.

My ex had never had his own checking account before because his ex wife paid the bills and my ex had a debit card. They didn't handle their finances very well because they both loved to spend his money.\n\nEverything went fine with us and money, no arguing, no upsets. That is until my ex began spending a lot of his money on motorcycle parts and car parts. His hobby was fixing up bikes and cars and from what I saw on Facebook he is still doing it. He was spending so much money on this stuff that he didn't have his share of the bills including the mortgage. The shit hit the fan. \n\nEverything was in *my* name because he had moved in with *me*. The house was mine as well and when my ex didn't have his share of the bills, the bills started getting paid late and it began to hurt my credit. I had worked very hard for a long time to get my credit score back up from it being low. I was extremely upset with my ex. Things went from bad to worse and when I caught him cheating I kicked him out. ",

She is more hands off and doesn't care that I control tracking the money whereas I need to know what is being spent and where it is going.\n\nSo far so good. I've thought about the separate accounts with one joint account a lot but we did joint accounts almost as a necessity as we were that \"poor\" coming out of college that it just didn't seem to make sense to keep what little we had separate. Fast forward a few years and it seems to work so why upset the apple cart. It all just seems like you have to find what works as a couple for your own situation and make it work. You gotta talk about it and figure it out. Seems like those that stick their head in the sand or refuse to discuss it run into issues.",

So our view on money matched pretty closely from day one.  We usually can buy whatever we want, but mostly check with each other for anything over $100.00. It's more about bouncing the purchase off someone else to see if it's a good idea rather then asking for approval.  But, sometimes, we have to enact a veto on each other.\n\nMoney for us is just another tool.

All couples are different but we have a pretty large income disparity and this way theres no jealousy or anything when looking at spending amounts, its like you said youre a team and youre both working towards the same goal.",

Same as bank 1.\n\n3. is an online bank account linked to my account 1.  It's a joint account with spouse for household expenses and put set amount in every pay for groceries etc. The main reason we have this is there are no fees for ATM transactions at any ATM. ATM fees make me angry so it's good for my mental health. \n\n4. Retirement savings account online bank low fees good returns\n\n5. Mortgage, got best rate with another bank. Then set up savings account with that bank that mortgage payments come out of. Transfer set amount in with each pay. Also extra emergency fund $ usually sits in there. \n\n6.7.8. Savings accounts for the kids, got a cash bonus to set them up with mortgage bank. \n\nDidn't have a credit card until last week but due to needing a new roof used up most of emergency fund recently so got one with mortgage bank just in case. \n\nSo it's messy but there's method to the madness. \n",

Want to go on the big cruise 2 week vacation? Each of you save up 1k (or however much it is) and pool your money together when you purchase everything.\n\nThen on the vacation you can manage your money how you want.\n\nThe reason I am an advocate of this approach is because both partners can feel independent (assuming both make enough money to actually be independent). If you combine bank accounts it is easy for one person to take over and start controlling the finances, telling the other what they can and can't do. That isn't how any relationship should work ",

If I'm curious about her bank account I just ask her. Pretty similar incomes, hers is slightly higher. We've talked about this scenario but haven't enacted it so it's all theory at this point but...\n\nMost bills are easy to change which payment account gets used, so that wouldn't be an issue. We've traded before on who pays utilities/internet. We have separate cards but also two credit card accounts where we each have a card. So, if one of us left the workforce we would only use the cards we shared. We would make sure all of the bills on one persons bank got moved to the other which might be a hassle, but not impossible. \n\nAs far as a comment above where they said what if a spouse has hidden debt, that seems like way deeper of an issue than just financial independence; neither one of us is worried about the other's CC debt or payments because we've been open and honest about it since we were dating. \n\nNo matter how you handle bank accounts, when one person stops working the important part is to adjust your lifestyle to accommodate the loss in income. I think as long as you are both open and honest with money, and have a plan in place, getting bills paid should be relatively straight forward. ",

While in theory I am fine with this, when I see some of the crap that she spends money on it used to bother me because even if it was her paycheck and her account I felt it was at cost to me because l had a higher savings rate and paid a higher % of bills.\n\nWe now have both paychecks go one place and each get allotments that go OUT to separate accounts.  We budget the amount that goes out as a couple to each of our accounts.  At that instant, I have already spent it in mind mind.  What she spends it on is irrelevant as I already agreed to subsidize that amount and it's truly her money.  \n\nThe only debate is how much goes out and it's easier to manage because seeing it in the aggregate and the differential also makes her more in tune with her spending habits.",

We share the status and amounts if the other person asks, we transfer money if we need to, and we never stress about who is paying what. We also don't keep tallies on who paid for what when. It helps we have similar incomes, but even then we're open and honest about spending and wants/needs; we trust each other not to go out and blow money on dumb stuff because we're both responsible adults. \n\nTo be fair, I 100% support however a couple does it. Maybe we're just too lazy to join them? We just can't see a reason to do it yet that justifies the inconvenience. If one of us stopped working, that would make sense, maybe, to join up but even then, we'd probably just transfer ownership of the bills to the working spouse's account. ",

It seems very impersonal and needlessly secretive. How can you plan for a common financial goal when you don't pool your resources and work together? If you don't trust your spouse enough to share finances then what was the point of getting married?",

Additionally, because I earn money, he is not allowed to get SSI.

            "comment": "I've married to my wife for 9 months, but been together 3 and a bit years.. but we started a joint account a couple of months into our relationship.  (For reasons I'm not going to get into on reddit).\n\nAnyway, it taught me VERY quickly that I had to learn how to deal as a team, rather than a solo.\n\nI had NEVER had a shared account before.  Suddenly the extra money I was frittering away on random shit, wasn't just my money.  It was OUR money.  It was a huge shock for me.\n\nMy (now) wife was understanding.  We set budgets and slowly eased back on my personal spending.\n\nWe spoke about an allowance every week that I could use without having to talk about it .. (I spend a lot on lunches/soda and just random crap .. plus I liked to go to the casino or buy computer games).  Overall my outgoings were significantly higher than hers .. even though I earned more my outgoings outweighed this and she recognised it.\n\nIt was about 12 months before I felt comfortable with OUR account than MINE vs HER... it's a huge change.\n\nAnyway, we've been married for 9 months now.  We make our own lunches, I still sneak the odd coke on the credit card (which is under my name not hers due to her being on a visa that the banks wouldn't allow her to be an owner), but other than that - I'm comfortable with where we are at.\n\nWe save a shitload now.  (She's a saver, I used to be a spender), and I'm totally comfortable with our position.  We both met somewhere in the middle .. probably more me on her side than the otherway, but it's worked out.\n\nHaving a joint account was a huge shock as to how much money I was wasting, but it quickly taught me to watch my expenses.  More so that I didn't want to let her down or be having to lie about spenditure.  \n\nWe never got that allowance .. but it's not needed anymore.  She knows that I buy the occasional soda or snack at work.  I don't care if she wants to buy a phone every couple of years, or sees some clothes she wants .. because we save so freaking much now.\n\nWe're on the same page and I'm so glad we worked through mainly my spending problems early in the relationship, because it would be so much harder to change now.",

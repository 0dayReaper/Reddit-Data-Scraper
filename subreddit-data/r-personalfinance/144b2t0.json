            "comment": "Fellow BPDer here--I feel your pain.\n\nI tend to spend the most when I'm avoiding or not keeping track of what's actually IN my bank account, so I try to check it every single day and review what I've actually spent money on. That way I'm less tempted to just buy stuff under the mentality of \"oh it's fine, I have money.\"\n\nWhat also helps me is making a game out of spending and saving. I give myself a specific goal of spending less than $X on stuff I don't need, and if I succeed in doing that, I'll reward myself with a specific, reasonably priced item that I picked out during the month (giving myself time to pick something special and wait for it makes it a lot more enticing of a reward). \n\nAnother thing that has helped me tremendously is addressing the reason behind the impulse buys. I tend to buy a lot of stuff when I get bored/understimulated/sad, so I do my best to find cheaper or free alternatives that give me the same \"new thing\" buzz. I get books and video games from the library a LOT. I'll make a SHORT list of specific clothing items I want or need, and try to find those things at thrift stores/ebay/thredup for much cheaper than if I go to Target and just start grabbing stuff. If I've been spending a lot of money on food/drinks, I make sure I have easy \"junk\" food in the house for when I don't want to cook something or just want to indulge. \n\nIn my experience, when you try to avoid binge spending by just strong-arming yourself out of the impulse completely, you end up losing. I would say you're better off finding good alternatives to satisfy the impulse than just insisting to yourself that you won't give in to it. You're WAY better off spending $5 on a Digiorno's pizza to have on-hand than telling yourself you'll meal prep and end up spending $30 to get a pizza delivered. \n\nMaking your credit carts and savings account inaccessible (or at least not easily accessible) is a great help to me, too. I have my savings account in a separate bank and auto-deposit a set amount of my paycheck into it, so it's out of sight and out of mind. \n\nI hope some of that is helpful. I really do understand how difficult it can be, and I'm rooting for you.",

Maybe once your buying urge is satisfied, you can go on a return everything trip.   I have known some people that do this ad it seems to work for them, as returning the items takes time and effort that they would of otherwise be using to buy more items.",

What ongoing need does it meet?  How do I see myself using this going forward? \n* What's going on emotionally with me right now?  Am I upset, sad, (irrationally) happy and exuberant?  Am I trying to meet an emotional need with a thing?\n* Is there something around the house that needs doing?  (Make a to do list and have it handy to tick off.)\n* Have I been stuck inside too long?  Do I need to take a walk, stretch, go outside and touch grass?\n\nI suggest you write your answers down to these questions as you work through them.",

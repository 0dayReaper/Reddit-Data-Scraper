    "postText": "I know I've read this here before but had a real-life experience with it yesterday that I thought I'd share. \n\nGoing into the interview I was hoping/expecting that the range for the salary would be similar to where I am now. When the company recruiter asked me what my target salary was, I responded by asking, \"What is the range for the position?\" to which they responded with their target, which was $30k more than I was expecting/am making now. Essentially, if I would have given the range I was hoping for (even if it was +$10k more than I am making it now) I still would have sold myself short. \n\nGranted, this is just an interview and not an offer- but I'm happy knowing that I didn't lowball myself from the getgo.

What are you offering?\"\n\nThat puts it in their court. I've never had someone evade it at that point.",

Many ask you to input a salary requirement and many of those won't let you input something like \"Negotiable\" as they only take hard numbers. I feel like I'm gaming it a lot of the time by trying not to offer myself out for too low but also not disqualify myself by asking for too much.",

                    "comment": "You can just put $1 or some ridiculously low amount that the input will accept When asked about it later, I'll just up front say I don't make it a practice of setting salary expectation until I know the role and benefits better. You still end up in the ongoing dance back and forth eventually, but at least it gets you past the computer form and you're negotiating with a real person at that point. \n\nEdit: love all the discussion on this - negotiating is a game I love to play and chat about.  Lots of folks posting how this might get your resume auto filtered into oblivion. While that's true, my assumption was that if you're going through the numbers game of online automatic applications, you're already dicing with the algorithm gods anyway, and this just moves the game one step further without too much investment. If you really are hunting the dream job, I think there is no substitute for getting creative to get around these digital gate keepers and talking to a real person. Go to meetups the company hosts, offer to buy someone that works there a coffee or lunch even to ask about the work (not directly for a job), volunteer to help out with a project or even charity event the company is hosting. Hiring people want to find good candidates with minimal fuss, make it easy on them if you can - Good hunting y'all!\n",

I'm tired of this \"Upload your resume and salary expectations here. Type everything you already uploaded on the last page here now.

Talking to a number of people in my field, and my area, I felt pretty confident I was being pretty reasonable.  He nodded and said \"okay thats a decent number...\".  Second interview, came up again, said the same thing.  Third interview was him, and a panel of other people I'd be reporting to.  His boss brought up salary and I said the same thing.  And he says \"Okay, I think thats doable.  You wouldn't believe what some people were asking...\".  So I get the job offer a few days later.  10k BELOW what I said my minimum number was.  It was less than what I was making at my current job.  They would not budge on that number.  I said that I appreciated the offer, it was great meeting all of them, but I felt like their offer was below the fair market value of someone with my skill set.  \n\nAn hour later the guy I originally interviewed with called me back wanting to know why I didn't accept it.   I told him the salary was to low, and he proceeded to call me every name under the sun.  I hung up on him about half way through the rant.  The job was open for another 8 months or so, the finally had to out source it to fill the position.",

My wife's job has policies about not discussing wages/salary amongst employees. She's been there for years and it gets talked about behind closed doors, usually one on one, or whenever the reviews/raises go out (once a year) so she knows roughly what everyone makes.\n\nEDIT: Lots of talk about how a policy like this is against the law in the United States; Aaaaaand, we're in Canada. I couldn't honestly tell you if it was actually legal or not here (obligatory \"sorry\") - BUT, I do find the responses very interesting.\n",

That is why you see so much scrambling over employee policies and handbooks etc. In essence, would a policy - even if it doesn't explicitly say so - cause a reasonable employee to assume the protected activity is prohibited?  If yes there is potential liability.  This is why the NLRB can scrutinize policies in a vacuum and find violations.\n",

Or you create a position that's exempt from civil service, so that person can be hired private sector-style. Or you make all candidates do a written exercise in addition to the interview, which is tailored to the preferred candidate.\n\nThose are basic HR 101 ways to manipulate the system, there's also more complex ways.\n\nFor instance, management wanted to hire one of their buddies from the private sector to a public sector senior position, which was supposed to only be filled by promoting an existing civil servant from a junior position. So we created an exempt junior position, and appointed the buddy to it on a 1-day contact, from where the buddy promoted to the senior position as an \"existing\" junior level civil servant. The buddy didn't even show up for their 1 day of junior level work, they were allowed to work from home, which isn't approved for most employees in the department. Dozens of legit civil servants who had put in years at the junior level were passed over for the buddy.\n\nWhen I started it was all talk about the rules and fair play. Once you get high enough up the ladder, you find out how it really works. It's like how you have to get to a certain rank in Scientology before they tell you about Xenu.\n\nSource: work in public sector HR.",

It was a dream job that would have meant leaving a job I truly hated with no growth potential so I was willing to skip the negotiations and leave money on the table. Frankly, I woukd have been surprised to learn they could afford me, but I figured it was worth the conversation. \n\nThey laughed. One guy, who I'd known but not well for several years giggled a bit, but the guy who asked the question chuckled heartily. And then he said \"Yeah, we can handle that.\"\n\nSo I assumed I'd lowballed myself and made a mental note. \n\nThe interview went great, and they asked me to come in for one day of work as a tryout. I was on four 10 hour days so that was no problem. I came in, worked an entire day. 8 hours. Did a lot of great work, impressed a lot of people. \n\nThey emailed me a week later and offered me about half of what my salary requirements were. \n\n\"We dont want to waste anyone's time\" was one hell of an interesting choice of words. \n ",

If they required proof or something I would've just explain how I calculated it all.\n\nI think the whole interview process is really shady.

I stopped asking salary history a while ago because it was common practice among the \"fairer / human workplace\" thought leaders in the field and generally understood that it's a toxic question and perpetuates a lot of bad shit, but I'd always get pressure and flak from my HR Directors, Partners, Hiring Managers etc and often be forced into requiring this info from our candidates. Now that it's a law, I can be a fair and honest recruiter, acting as a resource and a partner for our candidates, not an enemy / gatekeeper. ",

It is a dance. I usually ask on the first call from the headhunter / recruiter \"What is the general range of compensation for this position?\" . This is something they normally have in front of you, and the person cold calling is usually not the person who does the 'negotiation' to see your starting range. \n\nThere have been a couple times the HR absolutely would not budge and required a number. I would simply say \"Between *75% of current pay* and *25% more than current pay* ,depending on the benefits and job responsibilities\". If you get backed into a corner, put a big range, and then later say ... the benefits aren't nearly good enough, and the responsibility is high enough that the low offer simply isn't an option.  \n\nThis is coming from a software developer specializing in Cloud/SAAS/Agile/Medical/Finance , so your mileage may vary.

If we can't go on, I understand.\" Turns out they didn't really need a number because we went on. They offered me $13k more than  my current salary and I negotiated them up to $25k of my then current salary. Sharing never helps you. I would have never gotten that big of a pay difference if I had told them. (I didn't end up taking the job).",

I won't even waste my time going to an interview unless they tell me the salary range. Obviously things are different if you don't already have a job, but if you do and you're just looking around, always get the salary range first.\n\nI had a company fly me across the country for an in-person interview that took all day. They offered me the job. It was $20k less than I was already making and they told me I'd have to move to a higher cost-of-living area. I told them I wasn't interested and they made a better offer, but still not enough to make it worth it for me to move. I was expecting much more.\n\n",

My cold brew method I developed myself won 2nd or 3rd in a national competition and I think there was some prize money, yet I got no reward for my efforts to start it all. Just our warehouse team of 6 brought in over 8m per year, not to mention the coffee shops that bring in 5m per year. They were making bank, yet couldn't spare the cash to pay anyone a good enough wage. I just happened to be the most underpaid out of anyone.\n\nThe coworkers were awesome which is the only reason I stayed so long, because the management was pretty poor at best. I visited when I came home recently and the place is kind of falling apart now. Our manager was fired which caused 2 of the other guys to leave and the star accountant/office manager just quit a week ago. It's a great operation so it bums me out that the owners are so sucky. I'd love to keep working there if they were fair to us, but sadly they are not.",

            "comment": "Nicely done! \n\nFor people reading this thread wanting to know more about approaches, here's a repost of mine from a while back.\n\n\nThe best time to talk about salary is when they have decided they want to hire you. If they try to talk about salary before that time, try to put them off by saying things like \"why don't we continue the conversations to see whether there's a good fit before we discuss salary\". \n\nWhen you start to discuss salary, do everything you can to have them make the first move and cough up a number (see below, and other comments in this thread). At that point you can start the negotiations. The company almost **always** has room to adjust, especially if it is a big place and they have someone that they want to hire. They don't want to go to the expense of screening and interviewing more candidates, checking references, making offers, losing working getting done, etc for another few thousand a year.\n\nMake sure you look beyond just salary and are considering a complete compensation package which may include vacation (more accrual or more to start), signing bonus, relocation expenses, retirement contributions, etc, in addition to the salary. Some of these may only be available to executives though. Ideally you would want treat each one of these separately; negotiate base salary, then vacation, then lower deductions on your health insurance, etc.\n\n**If you have the time, meet with a professional counselor and work on how to negotiate!** When I was applying for jobs after graduate school I went to a counselor and we spent an entire hour on negotiation techniques. It cost $60 and I used what I learned to increase my starting salary from $73K to $88K, with a grade increase to boot. That was over 15 years ago, so I'm at over a $200K return (not including the percentage increases during the raises) on a $60 investment. \n\nMake sure you look at GlassDoor, but you'll find a wide range and it may not be that helpful.\n\nI put the material from my time with the counselor [here](http://imgur.com/a/obsKn) so take a look at it and ask if you have questions. The key points are as follows:\n\n1) These negotiations should always be done in person if you can swing it\n\n2) The first person to mention a salary number is at a disadvantage. If they press, you can say things like \"I'm sure your company has a standard salary range for this position. What is it?\" or (if you have a previous salary history) \"Given the new responsibilities of this position, I don't believe that my previous salary is terribly relevant to the discussion\"\n\n3) Talk in ranges. When I was offered $73K, I responded with \"I was expecting something in the low $90s\". That was when he said that that type of salary would be for a level 4 and this is a level 3 position that the offered, so I countered with \"then maybe I need to be a level 4\". I got the level 4 and $88K\n\n",

I don't want to waste time interviewing for a position that will pay me 25% less.\n\nBut when it comes to a job I'm actually interested in, my last one I absolutely refused to name a number first.  And they asked several times in various different ways (current salary, salary range, salary expectations, \"well, we have to put down something,\" etc.)  I would give answers but they were never answers with numbers in them (e.g. expectation = \"I expect an amount appropriate for the job title and my experience in this industry.\"  Current salary = \"You know I'm a principal engineer at Microsoft, I'm sure you have some idea of that range\" [I say fully knowing that that range is approximately $300,000 wide and thus this answer is useless])  It frustrated the recruiter a bit but they were interested in me and were willing to continue anyway.\n\nThe result was that they offered me 30% more than my previous salary -- probably more than I would have dared to ask for.  So I asked them to come up 10% from that offer and I'd take the job, which they did.\n\nObviously how well this works depends very much on your bargaining power.  If you're going for an entry-level job that you know has lots of applicants, you're probably going to have to just answer their questions.  If you're a good candidate for a job that you know is difficult to hire for, though, hold the line and never name a number first -- if you're the first to say a number, that's the ceiling, but if they're the first to say a number, that's the floor.

A few months later, he invited me to come work for them, too. I built a spreadsheet that compared the compensation of both firms. The goal was to determine how much they would need to offer me such that I had the same amount of cash in my pocket (lateral move). The analysis compared salary, 401k contributions, health insurance premiums, maximum out of pocket for healthcare, mobile phone reimbursement, commuting/local travel reimbursement, and paid time off. I learned that in order to move *laterally* their salary offer would need to be at least $30k more than my current job. I would have required more than that. They could not meet the requirement and no offer was made. My friend never did the math and basically changed jobs for less money.  \n  \n**Lesson: Determine ahead of time what a lateral compensation will be including all benefits that impact your wallet.** There may be qualitative benefits like a Koi Pond and proximity to a nice coffee shop ... but you should know the REAL compensation, not just salary.",

            "comment": "You did good, OP. That seven-word question was worth $30,000. How's that make you feel? \n\nSpeaking from first hand experience, clawing back from a low salary early in a career takes years. Nearly a decade in my case and I'm still working on getting to a truly competitive salary for someone with my experience. It also means you have to hop around, which can harm your reputation in some industries. You may or may not get this job, OP, but this sort of proactive strategy is what will put you lightyears ahead of some of your peers a decade from now in terms of HH income. By then you could expect to be earning 20% more than what you might be offered today, while they could be daydreaming about the salary you left behind. That has a huge impact on financial freedom, debt reduction, home purchases, and most importantly peace of mind thanks to improved financial security. And if you're fortunate enough to marry someone with the same attitude and aspirations \u2013 look out! You just potentially 10x'd your financial goals!\n\nSo many people, especially new grads, fail to ask the question you asked. Fear paralyzes us at that stage. Fear of not getting the job. Fear of encroaching student loan payment deadlines. We pay tens of thousands of dollars for a diploma but no one teaches us how to GET the job and the salary that feels fair for the work we'll provide. Jordan Peterson had a colorful back and forth with a news anchor on this subject recently, albeit more tethered to the gender pay gap in Canada. \n\nUltimately, whoever mentions a number first loses their ability to negotiate. If an employer knows I'll do the job for $50k, at best I can get them to move up 5% to seal the deal. Conversely, if a candidate knows the range or banding of a position, (GlassDoor has been a game changer for salary transparency) he or she is much better suited to ask for a competitive salary. I was once so eager to leave a bad company that when a recruiter asked what I was currently earning, I told her. I was so naive and desperate to vacate a job that I was willing to mortgage my future earnings just to get out. They offered me just enough to get me to agree to the job. Always ask what OP asked. It'll earn you more no matter what.",

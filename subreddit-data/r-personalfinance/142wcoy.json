What is my smartest course of action? Obviously I\u2019m trying to find a job. I previously had a job as an IT project manager making 123k a year. Help. Please!",

If people answer the phone when past due 35 days we can suggest non-profits, internal assistance applications, etc. but if we have 120 days without hearing a peep you've kind of forced our hand. Call them more often then they expect with updates and stick to a schedule for a repayment.",

Talk to the bank and explain your situation, when I was there you can either qualify for a repayment program with 0 or very little interest or a settlement. The bank will offer you absolutely nothing until your account is past due. You have 180 days until the account is officially \"charged off\" which means it's sold to collections. Honestly of you're facing such hardship I would go for a settlement. When I was there and you reached 180 days we could offer as low as 15% of the balance and then it changed to 20%. The older your account is the better the settlement since they risk losing your account. Only catch is this settlement amount must be paid off in 3 months if you miss a payment it charges off and gets sold. The balance you did not pay must be declared on your taxes which is much better regardless. Do not work with a debt collection company they will simply charge you a lot more just to talk to a bank rep for you. Talk to a representative directly. Good luck.",

That's fraud and it's dangerous.\n\nFrom friends who have worked in HR, Recruiting and managers, their advice boils down to something like this: Keep your CV to no more than 3 pages (and if you can keep it to 2 even better) and don't fill it with all your past jobs and education. Keep Just the ones that are relevant to the job. This will make things easier for the company, as they don't have to go through so much filler. Of course, this may vary from industry to industry. \n\n(I know, technically that's against the original meaning of the word CV, but bear with me for a second, if you want let's say a White Collar job, they usually don't care you worked in McDonald when you were a teenager).\n\nAnd if you do this, you should pass the background check anyway, because again, you're not lying. If they ask for more details about the gaps, you should give them. The only reason to omit this information is to bypass the step where some recruiters (or worse, automated systems) simply discard CVs for \"over-qualification\".\n\nIt's not a lack of integrity to apply for a job you are prepared for, but because some recruiters (not all of course) have a preconceived notion of \"yikes, this guy's got a lot of years of experience, he's probably going to ask for an offer above the budget, why waste my time interviewing him?\", we have to play these silly games.",

We know and he knows, we encouraged him to take this career path when he brought it up. He had been doing it since the first of the year, but on a wait list since last fall. I was just pointing out that McDonalds pays more than $15 an hour in most places and OP can work a job like this until he gets back into a position he wants",

Most jobs harder to get than literal minimum wage fast-food jobs have an interview process that is at least this long if not more, and then will typically not have you start until the pay period so their accounting isn\u2019t screwed up. It took almost a month and a half to finish interviewing for the job I got hired at and then another week and a half to start after I accepted their offer. It was over 3 months after I was \u201claid off\u201d before I started a new job with a paycheck.\n\nUnless you\u2019re ex-Google or ex-Oracle in the CS field or ex-Lockheed Martin or ex-Boeing or something in the engineering field and have recruiters practically breaking your door down, getting a job is a long and difficult process, especially now that any job can and will have applicants from everywhere on the planet.",

It\u2019s not $120k a year, but it is excellent, can\u2019t complain. Some of this is warehouse specific, but there is also tons of advancement opportunities. They really encourage everyone to move up the ladder and they do their best to facilitate that happening if that is your goal. Managers often make more than $120k, GMs make more than surgeons in many parts of the country, and a college degree is not at all required to move up after you\u2019re hired in. I love it, and look forward to going to work everyday, which is quite rare. The work culture at my store specifically is incredible, but of course that is going to vary from store to store. \n\nI highly recommend applying for anyone considering it.",

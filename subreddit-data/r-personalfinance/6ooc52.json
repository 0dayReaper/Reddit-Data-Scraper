    "postText": "I've encountered many people, both in my personal life and online, that insist upon using a debit card for their purchases, instead of using a credit card -- either because they don't yet have one, or because they have some fear of using a credit card. There are literally no cons to using a credit card if, and here's the catch, **you're responsible**. That's all. There are so many pros built in to using a credit card over a debit card. Here are a few:\n\n**It's safer!** When you use a debit card to make a purchase, you're essentially handing the merchant direct access to your bank account. Should the waitress at the restaurant you're eating at write down your debit card number or should your favorite grocery store experience a breach, that's direct access to your account and your money. Yeah you can file a fraud dispute with your bank and get your money back eventually, but in the meantime, that money is poof, gone.\n\nCompare this to using a credit card - when you do this, you're using the creditor's money to make your purchase and you don't have to pay it until your statement closes. You have a 30 day window in between payments to make sure that all purchases on your card are yours. And if there's a purchase you didn't make, that's not your money missing. \n\n**It builds your credit.** When you use a credit card RESPONSIBLY, it will build your credit over time. Which if you're young may not be a big deal to you, but eventually you might want to buy a car or house, and unless you have a lump sum sitting in cash, you're going to need to finance it. Low interest loans are granted to people with good credit scores, meaning you pay the bank less in interest to use their money. Compared to someone with poor credit who will either get a high interest loan or no loan at all.\n\nThe caveat here is that you never miss a payment. EVER. A good rule of thumb is to only spend on credit what you can pay cash for at the same time. You should never buy something on credit that you couldn't otherwise afford at that same point in time with your debit card.\n\n**Purchase protection.** A lot of major credit card companies (like American Express and Discover) offer a suite of purchase protection features. This is especially useful when you buy big ticket items (like a flat screen TV or laptop, for example), because it adds a layer of protection to you, the consumer. Some features are:\n\n* Accidental damage coverage - if you break your device in the first couple months of owning it, you can get it replaced by your credit card company.\n* Better price guarantee - just bought an expensive item but found a better deal somewhere else? The credit card company will cover the difference.\n* Theft protection - if your item is stolen within the first few months of owning it, your credit card company will replace it for you\n* Extended warranty - all my credit cards offer 100% of the manufacturer's original warranty on any purchase. 1 year manufacturer's warranty on my iPhone becomes a 2 year warranty including the extra year of coverage from the credit card company. \n\nAnd many more.\n\n**The credit card company will reward you for using it.** Most credit cards offer points or cash back that you earn every time you swipe your card on things you'd already be buying anyways. Same applies for paying bills. So by using a credit card, you can get a percentage of cash back or points that you can redeem later or put towards a purchase or vacation/trip.\n\nSome tips on using a credit card: \n\n* NEVER miss a payment. EVER. You will destroy your credit with as little as one missed payment.\n* Only buy on a credit card what you can afford to buy on a debit card at the same point in time. This is how people end up with $1,000s in credit card debt - because they use their card irresponsibly and then can't afford the payments. Being responsible is the only thing it takes to use a credit card.\n* Pay in full - only suckers make the minimum payments. When you only pay the minimum each month, the credit card companies will charge you interest for using their money longer than the 30 day statement period. Whatever you heard about making the minimum payment to boost your credit score is false. Paying your card off in full achieves the same score improvements.\n\nHopefully this post is enough to convince you to make the move to responsible spending with a credit card. They're awesome financial tools to build your credit and build your future as a responsible adult, and all it takes is responsibility and self control now.\n\nHere's a success story for you now that you've gotten through this post. A couple months ago my credit card number was skimmed and used several states away from me. The purchase was at a small convenience mart and was only a few dollars, as the thief was likely testing the card to make sure it works. My bank notified me immediately of the fraud alert. All I had to do was say it wasn't me who made the charge and it disappeared. Never had to deal with it again. Granted, a couple bucks didn't do any harm to me, but had that been a purchase of $1000 or more, that would have stung if it was my debit card that made the purchase.\n\nI applied for my first credit card the day I turned 18. I now have seven credit cards with over $100,000 in available open credit across them and a credit score of 819 at a young age. All it took was a little persistence and responsibility. If I can do it, believe me, so can you.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold!!!",

They know they aren't responsible and they don't trust themselves with it.  They certainly aren't going to say that to your face, though, so they'll just say that they don't trust credit cards, etc.  But this is why a lot of people only use debit cards.",

Then we switched to debit cards, automated savings (by moving X dollars to a separate account each paycheck), and ditched the budget.  Problem solved.  For whatever reason, watching a checking account balance decline to zero has proven much more effective at curbing our spending than saying \"Don't spend more than X on the credit card\" ever did. Maybe that means we're not \"responsible\" in OP's eyes, but hey, it works. ",

Look at your current bank statement, let's say you have 5000$ at the start of the month (I am generous) after regular bills have been paid. Now you've got to cover food, repairs, transport and entertainment etc. After that you've got what's left, and more preferably have a separate virtual account in which you keep track of your available funds for use on things you want. Don't buy a 4k TV and think you'll pay it off in the span of a few months. If you can't pay the bill at the store when you make the purchase you should not make the purchase. Save up and buy it when the funds are available. The credit card has only one purpose (other than security of your actual money) which is to build up rewards and give you free money from your regular purchases. ",

Pay with your EC card, the supermarket will hand that info off to Schufa. Open or close a bank account, miss a dispo payment, Schufa gets informed. Get a phone contract or a new insurance, Schufa knows about it. Move to a bad neighborhood where people have not paid their debt back in the past, and your Schufa Score will go down too - guilty by association. \n\nSchufa is actually surprisingly creepy, but nobody seems to care about it. It's probably hidden behind too much legalese. Also, there are many more services of this kind. Next time you sign an EC card payment, ask for a copy of what you signed (you will be scoffed at) and look where your info is actually going.",

You can choose to run your debit as a credit card in any store and waive verification. There's no verification process of any kind in restaurants as long as the card is physically present. \n\nThe best security you have is to write \"see ID\" in the place you're supposed to sign on the back. Theoretically the minimum wage employee is supposed to give so large a shit about procedure as ask to see government identification to verify the name on the card, and many do, but I can't blame them for worrying about 100 other things when I'm one of many customers.

But I treat it exactly as I would a debit card: I can only spend money I have, and I pay it off immediately. I check my bank account daily or near daily anyways, so it's not really any extra time to do this regularly. So it's a really good deal for me. Lots of extra protection, great credit, and cash back, in exchange for less time than it takes me to brush my teeth every day.\n\nEdit: Since I've gotten a lot of responses along the lines of \"Don't pay back immediately, wait until the end of the month otherwise it doesn't count,\" I'll just reply here. I can't speak to whether or not it's better to do it that way in relation to credit; all I know is that this is the only way I've ever done it, and I do have excellent credit. Maybe it's less optimal my way, particularly for building good credit fast, but for me it makes up for it in the peace of mind I get being in complete control of my account and physically having to \"approve\" the charges as they come in. I feel like if I set my account to auto-pay I would be less responsible with my purchases, kind of an out-of-sight, out-of-mind thing.  If I had to pay it off on a specific day every single month, I can guarantee you I'd forget the day and miss it.",

One word of advice from experience:  Inevitably, as you get more comfortable using a credit card, you will bother to pay the balance off less and less each month until you are likely making only one or two payments each month, while still paying it completely down, obviously.  When this happens, **be aware of the date the statement period closes each month** and make sure you pay the balance to zero **after** the close date.  I learned the hard way that interest is calculated on the balance at the close of the statement period.  This means that it is possible to pay your balance to zero at the wrong time and accidentally carry a balance into the close of the statement and past the payment due date, thus incurring an interest charge even though you pay the balance off every month.",

I'd recommend the discover it for your first card, I haven't had any issues with it. You will probably start out with a $500 limit like I did. Idk why I bothered upping it. They will offer it and at the time I was just like, \"yeah ok\"... but $1000 is more than enough for me. Idk what the hell OP needs 30k a month for but whatever floats your boat ",

You couldn't carry a balance and you couldn't be charged instrest.\n\nAMEX made their money off wealthy clients who pay their bills in full each month.  How?  Merchant fee's and annual fee's.  AMEX Plat is targeted at individuals earning $200k+/year although anyone with good credit can get that charge card.\n\nThere is plenty of money to be made for CC issuers even if they don't make a cent of interest.",

Another bad example is internet companies like to suddenly hike their services from, say, $60 a month to $100. If you were on automatic payments, you might not notice until it's too late!",

And sometimes you can't pay it off immediately. And then a few months later there's another emergency that gets slapped on top of the old emergency you're still trying to pay off.\n\nAnd on and on.

All they have to go on is data that they have about you. While they can (and will) verify your income, they also want to know if you're the kind of person who will actually pay their debts in a timely fashion. Maybe you're bad with money. Heck, one of the big warnings about credit cards is that you need to be responsible with them, only spend money you have, and pay your bills on time. People often have a hard time with that and it gets them in trouble. That's exactly what the lender wants to know about you!\n\nWhat you want is to lend money to someone who is very likely to pay you back. Culturally, a serial borrower for loans between individuals is considered a poor trait, but that's because of the high correlation between that and people who mismanage money. Statistically, if your friend borrows $5 from you every week and pays you back the next week like clockwork, he probably is good about paying you back.",

I've had one since I was eighteen and I've never carried a cent of interest. I've paid it off in full every month, and I never spent more than I had in my chequing account. Heck, even then, I hate seeing less than a certain amount of cash in my account; I like there to be a \"buffer\", so I'd never even spend close to the entire balance in my account. The concept of having a negative balance just seems like it would be completely improbable for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I honestly can't see why, even for people like me, CCs are still considered detrimental.

I'm not even financially irresponsible compared to most of the population.\n\nUnfortunately cash is not useable online and is too much of an inconvenience in general for me to really use it much. But most of the population would be better served using credit cards sparingly.",

I can easily say 40% of most loc/cc holders are over leveraged and in significant debt. If you're bad with money but need to build credit my recommendation is to get a credit card, auto pay a monthly bill to it (cable, internet, et al) then cut up the card and stick it in the trash or in a drawer you'll forget about. Just make sure you setup purchase alerts on the credit cards website in case of unauthorized transactions. \n\n\nCredit cards aren't for everyone but you can still build credit and not put yourself at risk. Building credit is infinitely more important than your reward points or fraud protection. Debit cards have zero liability protection the same as credit cards. Depending on your account provisional credit for an unauthorized purchase on a debit card is possible. \n\nWhere I do recommend using a credit card is for expenses while traveling internationally. ",

Thankfully, I paid with a credit card and through the card's insurance, I received all the money back. Some of my friends paid in other ways and lost relatively big sums of money. Cannot stress enough how much that credit card insurance helped me out!",

Only hesitation is $100 yearly fee. Wanted to see others thoughts on the app and/or if there was something better out there!",

So I bought the year subscription.  Now it's less than $10 a month effectively because it's just part of my budget, and it's a sinking fund. My girlfriend and my best friend use it now too, and none of us want to think about *not* using it.\n\nOp, if you talk to any YNAB user, you can get a referral bonus that gives you a second free month. There can be a bit of a learning curve as you are actively planning you money, instead of reacting to spending. But I find it is very much worth it.",

So if rent is due 1st day of the month, you need to budget that based on prior paychecks - not based on the paychecks you\u2019ll get on the 15th and 30th. And while I set up some budget categories to refresh monthly like groceries, none of my budget is tied directly to my monthly income.\n\nIt\u2019s a big mind switch and takes some time to get used to, but it\u2019s worked better for me than Mint, I think because I got away from the monthly income = monthly expense time set.",

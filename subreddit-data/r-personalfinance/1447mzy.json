    "postText": "My old company had an HSA matching plan so I saved up a couple thousand in an HSA. My new company covers 100% of medical costs so I no longer need that money. On top of that I'm moving to a country with socialized medicine in a year. I've seen some people invest HSA money, how would I do that? I've considered taking the money out but I saw the fees are pretty bad.",

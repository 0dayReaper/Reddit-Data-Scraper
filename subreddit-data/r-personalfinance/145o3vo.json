    "postText": "Hey folks!  I'll give you a little bit of a backstory to set things up.  I'm 39 years old, and at the end of last year finally finished paying off my student loans 18 years after graduating.  I live in a rural town and my income (48K, increasing to $52K when a raise kicks in three months from now) qualifies me as \"low income\" by USDA Rural Development guidelines set for my county.\n\nThis means I qualify for a USDA Rural Development 502 Direct home loan with some pretty amazing terms.  It's $0 down payment, 4.125% interest, and no PMI on a standard 33y payment term.  You can almost move into a home with no money out of pocket. You can roll your closing costs into the mortgage so long as the house appraises above the sale price.  Even out of pocket costs like inspection fees are refunded at closing.\n\nI filled out the application last week, and late this afternoon, I got a call from the underwriter informing me that I'm approved for $293K (I'll be buying in the $150K range because I want PITI to top out around $1,000/mo) and I'll be getting my certificate of eligibility (like a prequalification letter basically) on Monday.\n\nOn the call, the underwriter mentioned that I qualify for payment assistance as well.  Basically this would take that 4.125% standard interest rate and further reduce it as long as my income is below certain government thresholds.  The only caveat is that the subsidy is subject to recapture at the end of the loan when you pay it off or sell the house.\n\nWhile I can opt out of payment assistance, my gut still says this is worth doing, considering the time-value of money.  Better for me to save those dollars now and pay them back in 10 or 20 years when I sell, right?\n\nAm I thinking about this correctly?",

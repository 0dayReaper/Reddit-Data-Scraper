    "postText": "I've been casually in the market for a vacation (summer) home in Maine and recently found one that I love. It's a three season home (non-insulated) and I would be seeking a mortgage (currently have one for my primary residence) to make the purchase.\n\nIn the past, I've heard from folks that lenders typically don't provide mortgages for three season homes and I'd need to go all cash to make the purchase. I've been doing my best google-fu, but I cannot find anything that confirms or denies this.\n\nMost mortgage websites seem to just discuss vacation/second home mortgages broadly and focus on elevated down payments and interest rates (I'm prepared for a 30% down payment, if that's meaningful).\n\nAnyone have insight onto whether three season mortgages are even a thing? Anything I should look into/out for?\n\nThanks for any insight!",

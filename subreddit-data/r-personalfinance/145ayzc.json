Certainly there are risks, but you seem to understand them, and a $80k condo is indeed within the realm of reasonable risks for some people.\n\nIs there an HOA? Do they mandate insurance? Homeowners insurance also covers some liability issues if other people's property is damaged, or the classic (perhaps apocryphal) \"someone slips on ice on your sidewalk and sues you for medical damages.\"\n\nIs it possible to buy an umbrella policy to cover some of those risks cheaply without a homeowners policy? I'm not sure. They may require homeowners before they'll write an umbrella policy.",

A simple trip-and-fall injury can leave you paying for hospital bills, the time an individual misses work, and even legal defense. These expenses can quickly add up.",

But you can certainly negotiate your coverage - if you have funds to self-insure for your personal stuff, reduce the contents coverage. Increase your deductible. \n\nRandom side note probably isn't applicable, but just in case: I will note that I have a unit at a self-storage place and they require me to have insurance but my condo policy allows me to transfer up to $10K of contents coverage to a self-storage unit so just a thought on what needs to be included in your calculations.",

But how bad would it be for you financially, to lose $105k?\n\nIf you have $110k, it would likely be bad. If you have $11.5M it wouldn't be worrisome at all.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI have a 3 year old son who I have been saving money for so that he can go to college later on. Lots of people have recommended 529s, but I'm a bit nervous about them. My mom saved a ton of money for me back when I was going to college but the money was lost during the [dot.com](https://dot.com) bubble which means that I had no money for college and had to take on a large amount of debt. She told me she would have been better off stuffing the money under a mattress. I don't want to make the same mistake as her. I think she lost about 40K in savings or something but I don't know many details. The account was basically empty by the time I received it.\n\nThe other thing that makes me nervous is the lack of options and control over investing in a 529 and all the fees. I know there are tax savings- but I'm worried that the fees and lack of investment options will undo the good of the tax savings part.\n\nThe other thing I worry about is future regulation changes.\n\nI love my vanguard IRA, but I can't put money into his IRA until he starts making his own money (which i don't think he can do until he turns 7). Once he turns 7, I plan on starting a small kid \"business\" (pet sitting and other stuff I did as a kid) with him since I think it is a critical skill set for this day in age and more so in the future. Teaching him how to save for retirement, college, car, fun money, investing and so on.\n\nI was thinking about just buying Tbills since interest rates are high. However, I have never purchased T-bills before and don't know much about them. I am usually a long term heavy stock index ETF investor for retirement, but I only do that since I am dealing with a long time frame (I plan to be retired for a long time and I'm going to put off retirement until I can't work anymore). I'm not used to investing in a medium time frame. I was also thinking about maybe just going with CDs. In the past, I just dumped short term savings into saving accounts for short term goals. I never had to save for something this large before and with this time frame.\n\nEDIT: The other thing I worry about is my kid blowing all the college 529. When I was in college, many of the guys I knew partied instead of studying and burned through all of their parents hard savings or were too depressed to study and just sort of laid around moaning. Many resented their parents pushing them through college. I don't want to play this kind of game with my kids in the future. \n\nAny advice.",

I'm guessing you don't have the full story about what happened to your college fund. \n\n&gt; lack of options and control over investing in a 529 and all the fees.\n\nUnless you are Warren Buffet, \"options and control\" are a bad thing. Most retail investors do foolish things, so limiting them to index funds is a good decision.\n\nFees vary by state (you don't have to use your own state's 529) but should be pretty low, e.g. NY's are 0.12%. \n\n&gt; I'm not used to investing in a medium time frame.\n\nIs 15+ years really a \"medium time frame\"? In 15-year time periods since 1927, the S&amp;P has been up in something like 98% of them and has beaten 4% annual (a generous rate for T-bills) in around 75% of them.",

Once they turn 18 (or as high as 25 for a UTMA) they can spend the money as they please with NO restrictions. \n\nOne of my kids was doing illegal drugs and running with the wrong crowd the day he turned 18. If he had suddenly come into a big sum of money it would have been disastrous.\n\n529s give you better control, and most let you choose different levels of risk.\n\nAnother idea might be a vanilla taxable brokerage account in your own name, with the child named as beneficiary. This gives you complete control in how it is invested, and under what circumstances it is made available to the child. Cons: investment earnings are taxable to you, and should you ever go through bankruptcy your creditors can and will take these funds. Money in a UTMA/UGMA account is taxable to your child, and out of reach of your creditors. Funds held for you child in a 529 are also shielded from your creditors.",

An UTMA will transfer to him, allowing him to spend the money on whatever he wants, including blowing it. 529 you would withdraw exactly the amount you need to pay qualified expenses (tuition, books, room &amp; board, etc)",

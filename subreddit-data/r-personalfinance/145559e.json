This means if you want to go on a vacation you are able to plan and go without worrying about money.   Also, if a car gives out you just by a new car.  You can also consistently do home repairs and improvement without the worry about money.",

It has less to do with budgeting than feeling you can financially do what you want and not worry about it.    Many of us need to make tough choices and put off many other spending for years or forever.",

Savings is withdrawn automatically, and bills are paid automatically.",

You have to make sure you don't expand your spending to match the income, and be mindful about urges to keep up with the Joneses. But our household income has tripled since we bought our house a decade ago. We got out of credit card debt and paid cash for home repairs and renovations. We bought a used Camry in cash (this was before the pandemic made the used car market insane) and will drive it as long as we can. We added the major expense of daycare into the mix. \n\nWe get a lot of family pressure to move to a \"nicer, bigger\" house, but drastically increasing our income while keeping fixed costs low has really has allowed us a lot of breathing room.",

The former is achievable, the latter seems like a path to burying your head in the sand. \n\nI plan well and thus any expenditures are paid for in advance from a sinking fund in full or part. It's only the unplanned stuff that stresses me out these days, and that's what emergency savings are for. Most days I know what I can spend and do a good job of staying on track. \n\nFor example I cash flowed $35K in home improvements and medical bills last year without blinking. Put them on the cards for the points and paid them off in full each month. I'd been saving for some and others were unexpected. but it felt good to know my savings account had me covered.",

What would need to happen to live off your base salary? Perhaps it might mean changing jobs if the base is too low. You have options, but I totally get they may not be fun or ideal options. \n\nI live off my base alone. Any bonuses or equity are a windfall and I never count on them. I can't. I was let down too many times. \n\nAlso purchasing a new car in cash might be something to look at anew. My plan on my 10 year old car (which should have another 100k miles in it) is to either pay cash when it dies or make a massive down payment and finance the balance. I did that to prioritize more urgent home repairs I have planned before the car is likely to go. \n\nSo much of personal finance is about priorities. What are yours? Fund those first.",

    "postText": "Hi all. I have a family of 4. Wife is pregnant. Kids and wife currently have chip/pregnancy medicaid. I dont have insurance but will pay for it next year through my employer (about 100/mo). My question is, I can barely afford bills rn. If i get a second job, i can afford to pay the 1k/mo for the family insurance plan and have extra money for bills/savings. Would it be worth to get a second job and lose medicaid or should i wait until the new baby is here? Thanks.",

That doesn't mean a second job, it means growth in your field, better company that provides education or better benefits, switching fields, furthering your education, or anything else that may help.\n\nJust getting a second job is not going to offset losing Medicaid, and it's going to take you away from your kids for twice the hours, and tire you out. Don't strive to stay on the hamster wheel longer, strive to escape the cage.",

Currently making about 22/hr, hoping for 25-26 in the next few months. Working 4 10 hr days. I was thinking about working retail or something for the other 3 days. Would you think that its worth it or perhaps find a side hustle of some kind thats just cash?",

            "comment": "You don\u2019t lose Medicaid immediately. States now transition you off. They got smart and realized people needed a transition period to better themselves. See your Medicaid office for details.\n\nBut retail for a second job? Unless it is the kind of retail that supports your trade (for instance, if you\u2019re a welder so you work for a welding supplier), the extra time away from your spouse and children might not be worth it. My point is, be very selective with the kind of part time job you have or look into gig work related to your trade.\n\nTo save money:\n\n- Make sure your tax withholding is correct. Don\u2019t hope for a big refund. You need the money now, not later. Go to irs.gov for a tax withholding check-up.\n\n- Requote your insurance. If you have auto or homeowners insurance, make sure you\u2019re not paying too much. Shop around with other companies.\n\n- Use charity. If an unusual expense comes up (kids need back to school supplies or a utility bill is higher than normal), consider turning to a charity for cash assistance. I volunteer with a charity that helps with rent, food, utilities, and other expenses. Our best clients are you \u2026 a parent who is doing their best to support their family but experience a little bump in the road. We want you to come in so we can ease the stress just a bit.\n\n- Stop expenses that ruin your budget by a thousand cuts. No impulse purchases. Go grocery shopping with a list and aim to never throw out food. Price meals per person, per meal, per day - $5 per day per adult for food is a decent budget. Save money by reducing money spent on disposables (paper towels, aluminum foil, soaps, garbage bags, etc). Cancel subscription services.",

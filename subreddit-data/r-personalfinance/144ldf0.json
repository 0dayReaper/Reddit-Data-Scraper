    "postText": "I am an incoming M.S. student for BME at Columbia.\nAfter completing FAFSA my EFC was 1,095. The school told me I was ineligible for a work study, but I could apply for a job at Columbia. Unfortunately no one has gotten back to me after applying and reaching out.\nThe deposit is $4,000 due by 6/30. In fact they extended that for me so I have to pay it by that date. I don't have that money as I do not have a job (I've applied to 100's of jobs and I might take a minimum wage at this point because my B.A. in bioinformatics from Hunter College seems to be useless)\nI've taken out student loans but according to the financial aid office I am unable to use that towards my deposit even though the deposit will go towards my tuition.\nI have only one parent who works however they support my family of six and my other parent is currently disabled. This new change has caused me to be a caretaker for that parent and public assistance and SSA is taking too long to respond.\nI feel completely helpless and anxiety ridden. Any advice helps. I'm the oldest sibling in my immigrant household so I have no one to talk to about this",

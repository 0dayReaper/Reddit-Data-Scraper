    "postText": "Quick background. I got my first credit card by accident. I thought I was filling out a \u201cloyalty card\u201d at Cabelas. Ended up being a line of credit. I was 23. \n\n4 short years later and married with a baby girl, I find myself with $16,000 in credit card debt. I actually saved my very last dollar and have it taped to my steering column in my truck. And when I say last dollar I truly mean it. We had negative balance in the bank and overtaxed all our cards. \n\nLess than two years later, we now have $16,000 in savings and no credit card debt. (We finance one of our cars) \n\nCredit card debt is crippling. My dad calls it the ULTIMATE SLAVEMASTER. It forces you into depression almost by default and controls every aspect of your life. \n\nHere\u2019s my list and I hope it helps you. I\u2019m no guru, I just learned the hard way. \n\n1. You will not pay it off later. When \u2018later\u2019 comes, you\u2019ll be buying other things to pay off later. \n\n2. Read Dave Ramsey\u2019s money makeover. It\u2019s got good tips and the tactics work. \n\n3. The Jones\u2019 can suck it. They\u2019re miserable and controlled by debt also. Don\u2019t buy things you don\u2019t need to compete with people you don\u2019t care for anyways. \n\n4. Pick up a side hustle. I taught myself to make skateboards, and would handmake 2-3 a week to sell to help pay off the debt. My wife picked up Birth photography \n\n5. Talk to your boss, ask what you can do to take a bigger paycheck home. \n\n6. Be a bitch about your budget. Set it and don\u2019t stray from it. \n\n7. Put post-it notes with $0.00 written on them at the office, in your car, on your mirror, on your phone background. Seeing that everywhere actually reminded me of my goal of achieving $0.00 CC debt. Not sure if it legit made a difference but I think it might\u2019ve \n\n8. Become emotionless toward money. I would get so pissed that I was dumping hundreds of my paycheck into debt payoff. It was only till I stopped giving a f#&amp;@ that it became easier to make bigger payments. \n\n9. Save nothing until it\u2019s paid off. It doesn\u2019t make sense to save money when you have CC debt growing exponentially in the opposite direction. \n\n10. When in doubt... overpay. If you run short on money in your checking, but whoop, dip into the CC for 50 bucks. Keep basically nothing in your bank account because \u201cyou spend what you have.\u201d My family could live off of $75 a week. But if we have $300 to live off of, guess what... we would use $300. So I would always put as much as made sense. A few times I overpaid but it forced us to be frugal. \n\n11. Unsave your cards on Amazon. So if you go to buy something you have to go through the hassle of finding the card and filling in the fields. \n\nThese are just some of the silly things I picked up along the way that I think would\u2019ve helped me stay out of the mess. We are so happy now that we worked our butts off to become financially stable. I hope this helped!\n\nEDIT: So many awesome comments! I understand these are basic tips and not hardcore financial advice. So please leave your advice, even if you disagree with my tactics because there\u2019s a lot of comment lurkers who are scanning for more advice, so keep all the comments coming!",

For me, it's a card game. I barely play it anymore, and when I do it's online. But I always feel the call of a new set when it come out. Today I made a little more than usual, and at Walmart I kept thinking about spending about $20 on cards to celebrate. But I kept telling myself I would be $20 closer to a car if I didn't buy something that I wouldn't use for a long time, if ever.\n\nAnother little thing is the 2 for $5 from McDonald's. I decided that was worth it over buying sandwich makings, but I found out today the deal ended, so instead of spending $8-$9 on one meal I'd just make a TV dinner at home. Or buy $1 cheeseburgers instead in the future.\n\nRedbull was one thing I dumped a ton of money into. My workplace would sell them to me for $3 each. I'd drink 1-3 almost every day. But I get coffee there for free. I just learned to tolerate coffee more, and I saved almost $30 a week. Even if I had to pay for the coffee, it would still be half of what I spent on Redbull. If $30 a week doesn't sound like much to you, then you know fuck all about living or growing up in poverty.\n\nHell, the \"avocado toast\" could even be a new car. I've taken my neighbor to the store in my minivan I payed $1k for and even helped pay for her groceries, meanwhile her own son can sit outside her house in a brand new car he's paying $500 a month for, but can't take her without gas money.",

That's $120 in a month - when you're struggling to make ends meet $120 for bills is HUGE. At the end of the year that's $1560. That's a down payment on a decent used car.

Yeah it BS because it's small stuff, but this is were the money goes.\n\nMan I could go out with my SO on a Friday night just because \"it's Friday night so must enjoy\", then on Saturday we go for a brunch and get some avocado toast, no biggie.

When I was working as a tattoo apprentice, which is like an unpaid internship, and serving in a restaurant to pay the bills I barely had any money and I had a few thousand dollars in CC debt. People would tell me ALL THE TIME \u201cstop drinking your coffee\u201d like all my money problems would be solved. No, random idiot, me not drinking my $3 coffee will not solve all my money problems. My problem is that I don\u2019t make enough money to start with and that $3 coffee was often my breakfast AND lunch. Also, even if it wasn\u2019t, I was working 70 hour weeks. If I want to buy myself a coffee every other day I should be able to without being judged. Some days that coffee was the only thing I would look forward to my whole day. \n\nWhen I started making more money I immediately paid off my debts, all the while still drinking my coffee everyday.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s so nice to see so many people agree with me about this especially since it was something I was repeatedly harassed over for years. Its silly, but I love stupid lattes, and it got to the point where I would feel immensely guilty buying myself something i enjoyed. It\u2019s insulting and demeaning to be told that the one little thing you indulge in to make those 10 hour work days worth it is frivolous and irresponsible and you should feel bad for treating yourself. \n\nAnd to all the people pointing out how much money you could save by simply not buying coffee - I don\u2019t think you get what I\u2019m saying. The reason I work so hard isn\u2019t just to pay my bare-bones bills, it\u2019s to enjoy my life. Many people like me work immensely hard for very little money and I don\u2019t think we deserve judgement for choosing to use a tiny fraction of that money on something we enjoy whether it\u2019s coffee or a manicure or a video game w/e. I would not want to live if my entire life was just making money and then only using that money on things absolutely essential. No one goes bankrupt from buying a coffee everyday, if people are struggling financially I guarantee it\u2019s not ONLY because they buy themselves a latte.",

I'll sometimes buy a energy drink and a slim jim or other snack in the morning if I skipped a much cheaper breakfast at home.  That's $5.  Bottle shop on the way home for a beer or two, $6-$12.  Pick up a nice new 4 pack, $18.  Factor in if I went out to lunch that day ~$10 and suddenly some days I'm spending over $40.  Obviously I wouldn't do that if I couldn't afford to but I'm shocked at how much I do nickel and dime myself and there are people who do the same thing without the good fortune to afford to.\n\nEven being able to afford it, I question my bad spending habits.

They are retired now and I've been firmly in the industry world for a while.  \n\nMy boyfriend's parents start talking about DR and telling us \"you guys should read this and pay all your debts!\" and I had to explain that I only have 1 debt that's at 0% and he has student loans he is already aggressively paying off.  \n\nShe then says we need to set up Roth IRAs.  Again, had to explain we already had them and were maxing.  They seriously thought we had no idea what we are doing.  I own a house and have paid off all my student loans.

Wealthy people aren't necessarily paying *interest* (though in some cases it makes sense to do so -- when you have illiquid assets that earn a higher return than the interest on a loan collateralized against those assets, it makes sense to take that loan if you need some liquid cash).  They're not paying credit card debt at 15+%, though they're likely using credit cards for many things.  They're paying it off in full.\n\nThat's not to say that everybody will have such assets, but the underlying concept is still sound -- credit can work for you, if you know what you're doing and follow a few simple rules.  Just like a hammer can smash your thumb if you're not careful, credit can really get you into trouble.  But there are jobs that can only be done with a hammer, and there are financial tasks that can only be done with credit (or at least, they can't easily be done otherwise -- yes, you *could* buy a house in cash, but you probably shouldn't even if you had the cash on hand).",

We had always lived paycheck to paycheck and never seemed to have money available. Always paid our debt payments on time though. It was super tight for several years.  \n\nWe ended up taking the class three times in three years then started teaching the class at our church and did that on 5 separate occasions.  \n\nWhat we figured out was to take what worked for us, which was get down to no debt but mortgage and pay cash for everything else. When our house is paid off in 5 years we will sell it and pay cash for some land and a house to retire in. \n\nThe envelope system doesn't work for us. Kinda. We have 4 places we fund and pull funds for paying everything from those funds. \n\nI have life insurance through  age 55 and I'll not be eligible for it ever after that due to a stroke in the mid 2000s. Neither me or my wife want to worry about debt if I die between 55 and retirement so we plan to be out of debt by the time I am in my early 50s. \n\nLike you said Dave's plan has a certain purpose.  I always felt that it was to help get you on your own path to financial stability, security, independence, freedom, whatever. \n\nIf you want it to be dead nuts simple you can follow his plan and that's fine. \n\nIf you want to figure out the rest of your path after you have some financial literacy from Dave, you can do that too.",

Avoid the interest and fees at all costs\n\nExcept the fallacy here is that credit card companies want you to pay interest.  They don't!  They want you to use your card responsibly, and that's why they throw cards at responsible credit users (aka, people with high credit scores) and give them large credit limits.  It's not to entice them to overspend and pay interest.  It's because every.  single.  transaction on a credit card earns them money.  And if you're a responsible credit user, you're going to use your card for just about everything (I know I do, and I'm irrationally pissed off the few times I can't because I try not to carry cash with me ever).  The more transactions you make, especially of higher dollar amounts, the more money the credit companies make.  The very last thing they want you to do is to get deep into debt and stop making transactions.  Yes, in that case they'll get your interest.  But they'll get significantly more money from you over time if they keep you happy and credit-healthy.\n\nThis is also why nearly every card now has rewards for using it.  Various benefits are going away like price protections and such, but those are being replaced with more and more cashback/miles/rewards programs.  Because you disputing the price on a previous purchase costs them money.  You making yet another purchase to get even more rewards makes them money.\n\nBut \"those evil credit card companies\" are held up as boogeymen to scare you away from using credit cards.",

There's a sense of gratification when you buy a thing from Amazon and it shows up the next day. There's a sense of gratification from managing to keep up with the Jones', or maybe even becoming the Jones' yourself. It's valuing the opinion of others that gets a lot of people in trouble. Sure, some people other issues that lead to irresponsible spending, but it's fairly easy to remedy.\n\nYou have the willpower to go to work 5+ days a week, every week, despite your job being a soul-crushing shithole. Why can't you have the willpower to simply not click a button? It really is easy. The problem is that people go about it the wrong way, or see it the wrong way. Quitting smoking is supposed to be hard. I'm 13 months clean. How? Take it one smoke at a time. Just ask yourself if you **NEED** the smoke. Is your nic fit bad enough that you're about to do something stupid? If so, have a smoke. If you don't **NEED** the smoke, don't have it. If you learn to not give into your momentary desires it's actually really easy to quit smoking. It's the same with extraneous spending. If you just ask yourself \"do I **NEED** the thing\" and don't purchase it if you don't require it, you'll find it's a lot easier to not buy things later on. Another big issue is people looking at it like all or nothing, both smoking and finance. \"I had a smoke\" or \"I had an impulse buy\" aren't the end-all-be-all people make them out to be. It's the attitude towards the debt/spending/smoking that's the problem. Most of it is just being in the right mindset, and having the willpower to look at yourself and your actions as objectively as you can.\n\n&gt; But for whatever reason we keep being afraid to do the obvious but hard thing.\n\nBecause things should be easy. We've gotten soft. Something wrong with the car? Drop it off and it's someone else's problem. Need to groom the dog? Drop it off and it's someone else's problem. Phone battery life sucks? Trade it in and it's someone else's problem. As a society we don't do things for ourselves anymore. Need an oil change? There are self service garage rentals for $10-20/hr that have lifts and tools and such provided. Learning to groom your dog isn't super hard at all. Replacing my phone battery was a $40 iFixit kit that came with all the required tools and a brand new OEM battery. Not that difficult. Hell, I can avoid vacuuming my house by using a robot. It seems that, by and large, people don't want to put the effort in. People love to try fad diets, but won't make lifestyle changes to actually keep the weight off.\n\nIt all boils down to choice. You make a choice to go to work every day. Making another choice isn't inherently more difficult than that.",

However, depending on the psychology of the person in debt, it's often been shown to be more successful for certain people to pay off the lowest amount first.

It's why so many people take drastic steps to lose weight when in reality \"slow and steady wins the race.\" When taking on a large problem, not seeing results immediately can be incredibly discouraging, especially for those with issues with self control, which is often the case with those with large CC debt.",

Some things I get behind, other things, not so much.\n\nThe logic behind his argument, right wrong or indifferent, is that most people can only focus on one thing at once. If you\u2019re in debt, you may only able to do the bare minimum to get the match, which keeps you in debt longer. When you\u2019re spraying a little bit of water on 4 different fires, rather than drowning each one one at a time. You never get out of debt, and you spend much longer putting the bare minimum (6% in most cases) into retirement.\n\nHis advice is to stop retirement, use the money to pay off your debt, then once you\u2019re out of debt (except for your house), go back and start putting away the full 15% into retirement. Being able to putting away 15% for much longer (while still getting the match) will more than make up for the shorter period of time where you were missing out on a 6% match.  **Edit:  If this math isn't perfect, you get my idea.  If you had no debt payments (besides a house payment) and were making $50k+ a year, you can put a hell of a lot more than 6%, 15% or more into retirement.**\n\nHe even admits that his plan is not mathematically correct, but argues that if people were doing math, they wouldn\u2019t be in debt.\n\n**Edit #2:**  I'm at home now and able to give this some more attention.  Please stop telling me how smart you all are for taking the match.  If your debts are small, and manageable, good for *you*, but the average for people who carry a balance is over $9,000 in credit card debt at 15-25% interest.  The average student loan debt is $38,000 @ 6-8%, and the average car loan is $24,000 at 8%.  So while us here at** r/personalfinance **may have our lives a little more together, stop acting like the majority of people out there have their lives together.  Some of you are sitting here telling some random person on the internet who can't afford to pay attention that it's smarter for them to hold their credit card debt at 25% interest than it is to miss a match for a couple years and dig themselves out of a hole so that they don't have to fall back on a credit card every time they run into an emergency.\n\nAlso, some of you are using hypothetical fairy-tale numbers to justify the plan.  Do you think someone making trash money can afford to put away $100 a week (5k/year) while they sit here and post memes about how they're drowning in student loan debt and can't find a job?",

Just getting the headline of \"Don't take company match while you have debt\" isn't the whole story. If you are going to take 20 years to pay off debt then it's not the right solution. But if you whoop ass and pay off all your debt in 2-3 years it is a very effective system. But you can't be \"Dave-ish\". You need to be all in or the system doesn't work very efficiently.",

Although I've never had to use any of the extra protection on products that credit cards give compared to using cash, it's nice knowing that I can call up the card company and cancel a transaction if something shady happened. \n\nPlus like you mentioned, the cash back rewards I get are a nice bonus. Every year I'm able to use these rewards to buy all my Christmas presents for my family. It's never been an issue for me paying off the full balance every month bc I make purchases of things I will have to buy in my everyday life no matter what, and I have self control over what luxury things I buy. \n\nBut I do want to say each person needs to do some self reflection and decide if they will have that self control. I have 3 friends that are all in credit  card debt consolidation right now and they dont even use the cards for everyday purchases. If you dont think you can control yourself it's best to use cash or checks.",

Having an emergency fund is absolutely vital.\n\nThis is definitely a valid point, but look at it this way:\n\nOption 1: You save up $5k before paying down your $16k in credit card debt. You're continuing to pay interest this whole time, so you actually owe a little more than $16k. An emergency comes up, you have cash to pay for it. But your credit card debt is slightly over $16k still.\n\nOption 2, you use every penny you have to pay down your credit card and an emergency comes up after you've paid it down by about $5k. You have no choice but to put it on your credit card, and you charge that $5k back onto the card. Your credit card debt is about $16k.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeeping the debt while you save your emergency fund has a guaranteed downside, you have to pay more interest. Paying the debt while you save your emergency fund carries the risk that you'll have to add to your debt, but no guaranteed downside.",

Saying to \u201ccherry pick his advice if you\u2019re already responsible\u201d is honestly really good advice I needed to hear. We have zero debt (have never had it), $30k in the bank, and full time jobs with masters degrees. We\u2019re saving up for a house right now, and last week had to buy some plane tickets so I can travel to my distance college for my capstone and graduation. When I went to check out, they flaunted the \u201c$200 credit on your statement if you get this AmEx Delta card.\u201d And I did it. I read through the terms and everything, there\u2019s no annual fee your first year, no cancellation fee, etc. and my husband about had a FIT that I signed up for it because DAVE RAMSEY SAYS NOBODY GOT RICH OFF AIRLINE CREDIT CARDS! \n\nI explained to him my logic. We use a bank credit card for groceries that we pay off weekly, Dave Ramsey doesn\u2019t advise that either but we do it because we\u2019re responsible. This is money we were ALREADY GOING TO SPEND and they\u2019re going to give us FREE MONEY if we use their card instead of ours. And that was the first time we both went, \u201cwow, maybe Dave Ramsey isn\u2019t totally correct about 100% of things.\u201d I just got our AmEx statements and paid them off today. We saved $400 that we otherwise would have spent. That money is going to buy us the stroller we really wanted but couldn\u2019t justify purchasing. \n\nI\u2019m so thankful I started listening to him at a young age and didn\u2019t go into debt to buy stuff or to go to school. But now that I\u2019m still debt free with a 790 credit score and a fat cushion for emergencies, I really think we should find a financial advisor tailored to us specifically rather than listening to a podcast.

If you run short on money in your checking, but whoop, dip into the CC for 50 bucks\n\nThis is the mentality that allows most people who are already in debt to continue to be in debt (or make it worse).  Should you pay minimum payments and dump everything else into savings, no...but you should always have cash that is accessible while paying the most that makes sense toward debt.",

The end of last year was our rock bottom; all cards were maxed and the overall balance so high I won't tell *anyone* until it's way, way in the past.   In December, I looked at all our statements and noticed the \"pay this amount to be paid in full within 3 years\" wasn't *that* much higher than the minimum payment due.  So I made a resolution to not use the credit cards for anything, and to pay that 3-year amount every month.  We still have a long way to go, but we're 1/6 of the way there, the balances are paid down by almost 12%, and for the first time in my life, I've gone 6 months without charging anything.  I'm 45, so we're talking a long time racking up, paying down, racking up again.   \n\nIn a way, it's been really liberating to not rely on the cards for anything.  It will surprise no one on this sub that we've been just fine without the extras we would have charged, and emergencies have been covered by our $1000 emergency savings account (which is woefully small right now after a triple-whammy this month). \n\nI can't wait to be in the position to post that we're DONE with credit card debt.  Just 2 1/2 years (or less!) to go.",

My parents just didn't know about money.  They said take what ur approved for.  So I did.  Graduated with a business degree and a 3.7 GPA.  I had baseball honors and thought I did everything right.  Just put my nose to the ground, did well in school, played well in ball, the rest would manifest right?  \n\nEnded up miserable, alone, 6 hours from family, bought a house with a friend 107% financed, had 15k in credit card debt (It's sweat equity right???) (2006 mind u).  \n\nShit came crashing down.  My buddy moved out of state.  Housing market crashed   I had to rent rooms.  Worked 2 jobs.  Fell in love. Moved back to home state.  Used a property manager for 2 years to keep head above water on property.  Sold house to break even thankfully in 2016.  Put tons of work into it.  \n\nI finally figured out how to budget.  Listened and read Dave Ramsy.  He isn't the end all be all, but for 90% of the population his advice is sound.\n\nI lived with my now wife on just her teacher salary.  Used all of my salary for debt.  I had 40k, she had 10k.  \n\nGranted I was \"lucky\" to me making 50k (managment in a medical device company) while my wife make 48k in Iowa (Masters in education). \n\n She bought a house outta college (105k) with a small bit of help from parents. She rented 2 rooms and hustled.  She saved 15k working construction over summers whe in college.   I started waiting tables on top of my big boy job when trying to help pay down debt.\n\nWe paid off 50k in 10 months.  It sucked.  We didn't really live.  Just focused.  One tiny bite at a time.  Every extra bit was toward loans.\n\nNow we have a family of 4 (soon to be 5 in a few days).  I'm a stay at home dad.  We \"upgraded\" to a 175k house with more lawn and newer.  Median house is still around 300k.    \n\nWe managed to save up 30k in savings.  I've taken on a small bit of handy man work to try and get out of the house and contribute a bit.  \n\nWe started out in 2011 with some serious negative net worth.  Today according to Mint we are 136k positive.  \n\nWe are pretty simple and don't need much.  We have close friends nearby by family far away.  I still cook meals from scratch using cheap ingredients.  My kids are happy and healthy and so are we.  If there is a will there is a way.  We live different from lost 35 year olds, but seem happier.\n\nI just wanted to share my story in hopes that it might help somebody get motivated.  It's hard to swallow your pride some days and do shit work with a college degree.  And I say \"shit\" meaning hard.  My father was a police officer and my father in law has been in construction for 4 decades.  I know blue collar as much as anybody, but know our generations thoughts on such work.\n\nSome days you just gotta grind.  It's worth the temporary suck.",

However the comments about credit cards being powerful purchasing tools when used properly are also correct. \n\nOne thing I do to help connect the dots on spending is I enter the purchase in my credit card register (I use clearcheckbook online to track all my accounts). Entering it immediately helps me connect the dot and I can see my credit card balance go up right there. But then I also enter the expense in my checking account. No it doesn't affect my true checking balance yet but I've already spent that money. My checking balance goes down in my app and since that's the number I see all the time, it's much easier to connect what my real balance is because that accounts for also making that credit card payment when it's time. Seeing a checkbook balance low or even in the red, when the money hasn't actually gone out yet, makes it a lot easier to say no I can't afford to spend this extra money now.",

            "comment": "The way I use my credit card is pretty simple and yet very effective. I make a purchase and I immediately transfer money to my CC accaount to cover it. No matter big or small. Or am I going to return it or not. That clears the balance immediately after it's posted and limits me to spent what I only have in the checking. It's sounds pretty easy but it does require a lot of willpower to get started and it does require you to check your CC and checking at least once every day, if that's not already your routine. With this method I was able to built a credit score of 760-770, not very impressive but for me it's an achievement.",

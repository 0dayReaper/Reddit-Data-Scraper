    "postText": "Im at a crossroads right now with if I should pay off my $42000 car or put it towards a down payment on a new house.  I was married and after we sold the house got a good little lump sum that ive been saving along with other savings.  With the way interest rates are right now for housing I dont know if I will get what I want.  My goal is to find somewhere close to my toddler boys and have a mortgage of around 1200 at the most.  Im renting right now and can continue to rent but again I have a goal of buying.  Having an extra $675 a month will be good for the savings and will boost my credit score because it will be the only debt i really have.  I can patiently wait another year to see if interest rates come down.  Im still saving, renting where im at and Im close to my boys.  Just not sure what to do.  Here is my info.\n\nNet a month is $4500 ($54000) Gross is around $85000\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChild Care ($250 a week so $1000 a month)\n\nRent - $985\n\nCar Payment - $675\n\nUtilites (water, electric, internet, phone, garbage) - $300\n\nCar Insurance - $110.00\n\n3 Credit cards - $0 (i do put things on them for points but then pay them off at the end of the month)\n\nI eat out a lot but spend $100 usually a week for the boys when I go to the grocery store to get them snacks and home cooked meals.\n\nI have a sectional and kitchen table w/chairs and stools i financed at 0% for 36 months but will be paying it off as soon as my taxes come in.\n\nAny advice is very much appreciated.\n\nJDP\n\nEdit - I really appreciate all of your opinions.  Thank you so much for your individual insights.",

Then start 529s for the boys.\n\nYou're mortgaging your future and theirs by driving a status symbol.",

Take the extra plus the costs you would have paid on property taxes and maintenance and put 50% into savings for a down payment and 50% into your retirement fund/investment.\n\nYou can still buy in the future but having that huge car debt will lower your desirability for a mortgage and you will get worse rates.",

If you have car loan @ 2.5% and buy house for 5.8% it makes no sense to pay off car if the payment doesn't impact your DTI. \n\nIn other words words paying off the car is like refinancing it at  your mortgage rate, and you are also going from 5-6 year loan to 30 year loan!",

Financing cars leads people to not only pay interest but they buy a more expensive car than they would if they pay cash.   Leading to more cost and depreciation.   If you want to be wealthy commit yourself to not financing cars at a young age.  Same that payment and save the depreciation.",

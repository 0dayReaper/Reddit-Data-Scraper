For nearly all couples - and especially couples like you where there is disparity in incomes - filing jointly makes you come out ahead.\n\nExceptions to this normally come down to income-based loan repayment, in which case it often makes sense to file separately.",

However, only one taxpayer can claim the new clean vehicle credit per vehicle placed in service, and the credit may not be allocated or prorated between multiple taxpayers.\n\n&gt;The name and taxpayer identification number of the owner claiming the credit new clean vehicle credit should be listed on the seller's report.",

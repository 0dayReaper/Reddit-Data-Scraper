Getting rid of that is an absolute last resort *unless* you\u2019re selling your home to buy a less expensive home for cash (or possibly a tiny mortgage.)",

            "comment": "Assuming you have a 30-year mortgage, you have 20 years left on it.  To date, you've probably paid roughly $57,000 in interest on that mortgage at 3.25% (depending on what you put for a down payment).  That's a sunk cost irrespective of what you do.  Over the remaining 20 years of the mortgage, you will pay another $55,000 in interest.  It's this remaining $55,000 in interest that is at issue.\n\nIf you were to re-finance (and I'm excluding all things like closing costs here) with another 30-year mortgage at 7.25% (which is about as good as you'll find on a 30-year fixed right now), and if you're rolling that $50k of debt into the re-finance, you'll have a 30-year mortgage on roughly $220,000 (your current amount owed on the mortgage plus other debt).  Over the next 30 years, you will pay $321,000 in interest on that 30-year re-financed mortgage.\n\nIf you re-finance doing a 15-year mortgage, you could expect to get a rate of probably around 6.25%.  Over the next 15 years, that $220,000 that you'd re-finance would means you will pay $119,000 in interest on that 15-year re-financed mortgage.\n\nSo, basically, under your current mortgage, you know how much interest you will have paid over the remaining life of that mortgage ($55,000), and you know how much interest you would owe if you roll all your debt into a re-finance under a 30-year mortgage ($321,000) or a 15-year mortgage ($119,000).  So, the question to me is, if you kept your debt structure as it currently is, such that your $50,000 in \"other debt\" (which included your home equity line of credit and, presumably credit cards), would it cost you more than $64,000 in interest to pay that \"other debt\" off?  Because $64,000 of additional interest payments is what you are going to owe if you refinance with a 15-year mortgage ($119,000 of interest under the 15-year mortgage minus the $55,000 you will owe under current mortgage).  I don't see any scenario where you'd end up owing that much debt assuming you made any diligence to pay off those \"other debts\".\n\nIf you were to re-finance with a 30-year, it's the same question, but now the amount of additional interest is $266,000 ($321,000 minus $55,000).\n\nSo, my answer would be **hell no, do not re-finance**.",

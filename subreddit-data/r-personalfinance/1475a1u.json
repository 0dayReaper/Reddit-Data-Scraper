    "postText": "I'm a dual citizen moving back to Canada after 12 years and I've run an S Corp out of my personal home address for the past three years. I work from home doing digital marketing consulting and get paid from people all around the country. I'll be selling my home, so I need a new address. Can I move it to a state like NV to avoid state tax now that I'm no longer living in CA and use a registered agent/mail forwarding service to send me mail up to Canada? Or do I have to keep it in CA?  \n",

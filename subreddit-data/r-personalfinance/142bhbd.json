    "postText": "Hey! Just purchased a new 2023 Hyundai Tucson Hybrid SEL Conv the other day and now I'm posting here at 3am with buyers remorse. I financed the car for $680/month (5.9% for 60 months. Im aware that dealerships don't take returns but I'm messaging you all to see my options. I could afford the car but I will need to budget and I feel that if I need to budget to afford this car then maybe I shouldn't have the car haha. It seemed like a very doable payment at the time but now Any advice is massively appreciated! I have no other loans or debts  \n\n\nCar Information:  \nPrice: $35,950  \nInterest Rate: 5.9% for 60 months  \nSales Tax + Registration Fee: $3,649  \nDown Payment: $8,000  \n\n\nUpdate1: Here is my budget information! Thanks again for all the responses. Hopefully my math adds up. Running on little sleep  \nAnnual income: $105k (take home $72,648, monthly $6,054)  \nMonthly Expenses (Needs, Savings): $3,778  \nLeftover for more savings or wants: $2,276  \nLeftover for wants after new car payment: $2,276 - $680 = $1,596\n\nUpdate2: Wanted to quickly update here and say thanks to all the comments and suggestions here. This damn expensive lesson will stick with me for awhile (hopefully less than 5 years) but I will definitely have it hanging in the back of my mind forever. Glad I posted in this community.",

            "comment": "Did you make a mistake? Maybe.\n\nWill trying to fix it make it better? Probably not.\n\nFirst, important to remember that your mistake is not $680/mo. It's probably $200/mo. Because cars aren't free and you needed a car. So it's not the end of the world, especially since you have a market rate interest rate.\n\nIf you're thinking of trying to get out of it, remember that you paid probably $2000 in sales tax and registration fees. If you get a cheaper car you'll have to pay maybe $1500 again. You'll also lose a few thousand in depreciation/transaction (unless you can sell it yourself you'll get trade-in value and pay retail).\n\nSo swapping this for a $25,000 car probably costs you $7500 right off the bat. And you save about $2500 and end up in a worse car with probably no warranty.\n\nSo what do you do? If you can afford it, just pay it off as fast as possible. Amortize your govt fees and drive it for a few years. Re-evaluate and go from there.",

Now it looks like the difference in price in the 2 is about 6k. So it will take about 15 years to break even and hitting 300k miles. This doesnt consider that most hyundai hybrids only use fully synthetic oil which costs more. On the otherhand it is possible that maintenance in other areas might be lower but that is hard to determine, and may not carry over to hyundai like it does with Toyota.",

It shouldn't be scary. Go figure out that budget, because that will tell you whether or not you can afford it.\n\nAnd it might be that you can afford the car and still keep the rest of your budget in check. Good for you! Then, you need the discipline to keep to a budget not only while you have the loan, but afterwards too.\n\nIn 5 years you will have this car paid off. If you keep money budgeted for a car payment, but keep the paid-off car, then in another 5+ years you will have quite a bit stashed away for your next car.",

This people with financial literacy in this sub seems predominantly saving to a normal retirement age, which I think drives some of the negative responses premised off their own personal investment and savings plan and translate it to other people. I\u2019m not even talking about OP here. I\u2019m talking about anyone\u2019s mention of buying a new car. It\u2019s just a lack of self awareness thinking that other people have the same financial situation. To be fair, it\u2019s not just this sub, but every sub where the discussion is financially centered people just go ape shit when other people spend money in ways they don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t. None of us are the same. Even if some of us have similar incomes, we have different expenses and obligations, live in different places, etc. I guess I\u2019m just wanting people to treat each other a little better with more understanding that some people have more and less purchasing power and the way they conduct their financial matters aren\u2019t necessarily bad just because they are different.

Due to lack of cars in the market, the asking price of most cars 3-4 years old with 80,000 kms in rough shape is higher than a brand new car, because it's available now.   So we ended up saving money by purchasing a brand new car, and waiting for it to arrive.  Many new cars have a 4-18 month wait time attached to them.\n\nConsidering the dealerships know they will be able to ask thousands more than MRSP, they may consider returning your car for around the same price if you wanted to return and get something else.  Or you could try putting for sale somewhere, as you should be able to get more than MRSP to help pay some of those taxes you paid on it.\n\nThat being said I totally disagree with what is being said about used cars being cheaper than new, and to never buy new.  My first 3 cars I owned I bought used, 5-6 years old, paid about $10,000, and usually got around 100,000 kms on them before they would start costing me alot in repairs that I would need to get a new one.  I bought my last 2 cars new for around $25,000.  And put 500,000 kms on my first one without need for almost any repairs.  So a savings of about $25,000 plus thousands in repairs I did on those cars as they hit their end of life.  My current one is putting on the miles as well.  In my experience as long as you aren't flipping to a new car as soon as your new car gets 4-5 years old, it can be cheaper to buy new.",

Its a pretty significant fraction of your income though. certainly a choice I would not have made. I value my time more than fancy new cars, your preferences may vary.",

Make the payments, then maybe in a year try to refinance if rates start going down. If you find yourself with a lump of cash, make a bulk payment beforehand.\n\nYou could have this car paid off in 2 years without compromising your quality of life very much at all, and then if you take care of it, probably won't have a car payment again until your retire.

You can also just see if there\u2019s anything else you want to do - like walk dogs or anything else if you look up side gig ideas. Also a very popular option is teaching others from your respective knowledge - either from your career or even hobbies. \n\n3. The peace of mind a new car brings may not be relatable to you- but as someone who has had unreliable cars, spent money that I could never recover and have been left stranded, and also thought that just fixing things on a used car was enough - and even had two cars at times just to have a backup option- all those things are in the past and I would rather your car payment even if a little tight just for that peace of mind.\n\n- last thing - if you reevaluate your wants and needs - perhaps also consider skipping a month here or there to build up your savings / emergency funds / and a discretionary fund - that way you\u2019re in the positive for the months you do indulge-",

That info is: What was the price that you bought the car at? What was the down payment that you put in? What car did you trade in and what did you get for your trade in? Always think about the purchase price of the car, **not** the monthly payment.\n\nFrom your math, it looks like you financed $35,300 -- which means you paid a fair price for the car if you didn't have a down payment or trade-in. But if you put in a $5000 down payment and traded in a car worth $8k? You got taken for a ride by this dealer.\n\nAs to whether it was a prudent financial decision, what do you have in savings? What other debt do you have and what is it financed at? How urgently did you need a new car? Why did you need want an AWD SUV?\n\nIf you have money sitting there earning 3.5% interest in a HYSA then you can pay the car down sooner (double check that your loan has no prepayment penalty.)\n\nIt's a nice car -- I just bought almost the same thing in November -- '23 Tucson Hybrid Limited). After having a second child last May, I urgently needed a more spacious car than our 2012 Civic, with enough space for all our gear for weekend trips in the area, and really wanted the car to have AWD to cope with our local winters. The heated/ventilated seats in the Limited trim were admittedly an unnecessary splurge part of the purchase. But since my wife bought that 2012 Civic used in \\~2015, and we haven't had a car payment since \\~2018, I paid cash for the Tucson and we kept the Civic as our second car for the days we need two vehicles.

I know about 6 months ago the difference in price of a used vs new was not worth it to buy used.  I dont know if that has changed.  But never-the-less, you'll be fine, and have a new car to play with.  It would probably have made sense to put more down, but you can still pay ahead on the loan, and I would hightly recommend that you do that. You should be able to pay for this car way before 60 months, and that will save you a ton of interest.",

What I did was tighten my belt buckle and put every extra nickel I had into that car loan. I paid that bad boy off in 2 years and now I'm driving that same car for free. My advice is pay it down aggressively and enjoy your car - next car purchase both of us will be smarter about it lol",

I can only speak for banks I've worked at, but if the loan hasn't funded yet, you can call and say you don't want to proceed and they won't do the deal. \n\nThe dealership will try to put the loan with  another lender, but that's a pretty strong rate at the moment so they may not be able to match all of the terms exactly. If they can't, they would need to resign the contract and you can just say no.\n\nHowever, if the contract is already funded there's not much you can do. I would start with contacting the dealership. If it's part of a dealer group, they may just unwind the deal for you. That's a car they could resell easily. \n\nLastly, I'd check with Carmax and Carvana on what they will buy it for. Car prices aren't as crazy as they were a year ago, but they still make pretty high offers. It might not be that painful to go into something else. \n\nWhatever you do, just remember good lessons are expensive. This one might end up costing you $700 a month.",

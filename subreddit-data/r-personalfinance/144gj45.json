    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI recently started my first salaried job, recently married, and planning on saving up for my first house. I planned on paying down my debts and work on my credit score. The only thing is, I feel like taxes are eating up too much of my monthly checks. I currently have a pension plan that takes about 7% of every check, I filed my tax status as married, my wife works, 0 allowances claimed, and an additional $100 withholding from every check in order to not pay taxes at the end of the year.\n\nThe question is, because I want to pay my debts, save money, and invest my money as quickly as possible. Should I claim 1 allowance and take out the $100 extra withholding? Or should I just work with what I got?\n\nExtra context:\n\n* I have no kids.\n* I make a little over $80k.\n* I live in California, taxes will always be eating my checks.\n* Almost $2200 was deducted in taxes and pension.",

I understand that it beats 95% of experts.\n\nWhat I don't understand is the difference between an index fund and an ETF.\n\nIn terms of actively investing, I don't think knowing the definition matters one bit. I think the only thing that actually matters is actually buying and holding the sp500 overtime consistently.\n\nWhen cowrokers ask what the difference is between the two, the only thing I'm thinking is \"it doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is if you buy\"\n\nAm I delusional?",

            "comment": "An index fund can be an ETF. It can also be a mutual fund.   So sometimes there is no difference between an ETF and an index fund, they can be the same thing.\n\nVTSAX is an index fund that is a mutual fund. VTI is an index fund ETF.\n\nThe difference between an ETF and a mutual fund is in how they trade.  But either one of them can be an index fund, or an actively managed fund. \n\nSo an \u201cindex\u201d fund is a description of what the fund invests in, not how it trades. An index fund invests according to a particular index that tracks a segment of the market (the S&amp;P500 is just one index), it does not have a manager that chooses stocks based on particular criteria (that\u2019s called an actively managed fund).\n\nEdit:  You might want to read the PF wiki on investing. That may help explain all of this.",

They are just different share classes of th same thing, and VTSAX actually has *slightly* better tax efficiency than other mutual funds *because* it has an ETF share class attached to it.",

(M1 Finance may allow this for ETFs, otherwise I'm unsure of any others)\n\n* Mutual funds always trade at the NAV, ETFs can drift from it (controls are in place to try to prevent any drift from becoming too large for too long, but spikes do happen).\n\n* Mutual funds can always trade every penny, fractional ETF trading (outside dividend reinvestment) is not widespread at this time. This means ETFs will almost always have a cash drag unless you use one of the few brokerages that do support fractional ETFs.\n\n* Depending on the brokerage, mutual funds may have a lower initial buy in required (such as Fidelity and Schwab at only $1), unless you use one of the fractional ETF brokerages ETFs have a minimum of whatever 1 share costs. (This does not apply at Vanguard where mutual funds start at $1,000 for target date funds or $3,000 for broad coverage index mutual funds)\n\n* With mutual funds, you aren't the one dealing with bid-ask spreads.\n\n* Mutual funds may discourage timing the market due to how they trade.\n\n* Some people may find mutual funds easier to deal with and less stressful.\n\n* Some mutual funds (especially Fidelity's index ones) have lower expense ratios than comparable ETFs. (This does not apply when comparing Vanguard's ETFs vs Vanguard's mutual funds)\n\n* Mutual fund trades may settle a day earlier than ETFs.\n\n* Mutual funds may be traded for a different one as a single transaction at some brokerages, ETFs must be a sell then buy (M1 Finance might be excluded).",

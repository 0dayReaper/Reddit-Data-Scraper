    "postText": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ge-to-freeze-pensions-for-about-20000-employees-stock-surges-2019-10-07\n\nI see a lot of posts here about pensions vs 401ks, or people who say \"I'm not worried because I've got a great pension plan\", or something to that effect.\n\nWell, this is a stark reminder that pensions are not bulletproof.  Yes, ALL investing is some form of gambling, but with 401ks and IRAs it's at least YOUR money, which you control and can withdraw as needed.  I am *not* saying that pensions are inherently bad and that no one should ever use one.  They are a great cushion to your other assets.  But please, please, please: do not SKIP other forms of investing because you think you're going to be set for life in retirement thanks to a company pension plan.",

If they do though, two things worth noting: 1) benefits already accrued under the pension plan don't go away, only future accruals are stopped and 2) GE is replacing those future benefits with a 401k offering fixed 3% contributions and an additional match of 50% up to 8%.",

So I get 18% in my 401k and I only have to provide 6% of it.  And they cover the majority of our health insurance.  I picked the plan were they cover all of it. Plus 5 weeks of vacation.",

I've had around 6 cars in 10 years and most I resold at the same value or more than I bought them for.\n\nI am somewhat into fixing up 2000-2010 cars, and not afraid to get under the hood even if it takes a few days for me to do the repair.\n\nI really don't understand why people buy cars from dealerships unless they have the cash for the latest and greatest. A 2009 car will easily drive you for 5 more years, and you'll likely pay no more than 7k for it even in great shape.\n\nEDIT: I specifically avoid cars that are hard to work on, which means most EU cars. Honda, Toyota, and Ford are all usually somewhat reasonable to work on, in that order. When I go to buy a used car first thing I do is pop the hood and look at what I can easily access if I need to change or replace it. I tend to prefer Honda to anything else, and 3 of my 6 cars have been Honda.\n\nI LOVE the Honda Fit, and have owned two of them now, with one being my current daily driver. I've never had a car that was as easy to work on... But the thing is, I've never had to do any major repairs to them. The things just last and take all the abuse you could ever throw at them...",

I prefer to have 5 years out of a car or so and after i am done with it it is generally worthless. If i invest in a repair, i would like my investment to pay off.\n\n(I buy young cars with extreme km's, so generally there are some repairs related to the high odometer. Also, contrary to popular belief, the value of your car can be lower than the value of your repair and still be economical. The idea behind it is that another car of the same value will have similar problems. )",

In the phone interview with the recruiter I repeated that when she asked but pressed a lot for a number saying she couldn't pass me on to the hiring manager without one. So I gave her a number that I thought would be at the very top of the range. She was blown away and told me that I was over the top end of the range by $20k. It was a big company so their benefits were pretty easy to find online. Losing the benefits I have for such a small pay increase wasn't worth it to me.\n\nThe whole thing was pretty annoying. I get that you don't want to waste time with someone who isn't in your price range, but there has to be a better way to see if you're in the same ballpark.",

In July of 2017 the benefit formula was changed moving retirement for new employees from 55/65 to 57/67 and getting rid of special early retirement.  In our case we can thank teachers for screwing it up for us.  Local districts figured out they could game the system by doubling a teacher's salary for their last or second to last year, increasing their pension by 15-20% per month, and once that teacher retired the district could hire two new teachers for the same cost as one veteran teacher.  In a few years they manged to game the system so much that we dropped from over funded by 4% to under funded by 11%.  Now instead of calculating the benefit based on the final three years of service, it's the final five years and there's a cap on the percent of an increase year over year that will count, so if a person doubled their salary in that five year period, the first year would only count as a 50% increase for pension purposes, second a year would get the additional 50%.",

(1) freeze to new entrants = everybody already in the plan stays but newly hired people don't get it, they usually go into 401k or similar. (2) freeze service = anyone in the plan no longer gets additional service credited to thier benefit, but they do get the benefit of future pay increases when thier pension is calculated. (3) freeze it all = whatever your benefit at at the time of the freeze, that's what it will be at retirement. #3 is what GE just did. They did #1 several years back.",

Old vested benefits are generally protected, especially in ERISA plans.\n\n\"Soft freeze\" is the DOL informal term for a plan closure, meaning no new employees can enter the plan, but current participants can still accrue new benefits. DOL uses \"hard freeze\" to mean no new benefits accrue to anybody.\n\nThere are also partial variants of freezes and closures, meaning some employees freeze or some work locations are closed to the plan, but others are still open and unfrozen.\n\nIn this case, the GE plan will continue existing and paying benefits.  If you already have vested benefits, they are waiting for you when you become eligible for them.  If you work there 5 more years after the freeze, your benefit does not increase from those years.  If you start working there after the freeze, then you get nothing from the DB plan and will participate in a DC plan only.",

Nothing is guaranteed and at least I had the money in hand without the uncertainty of the pension payments continuing for the rest of my life.\n\nThis almost derailed my plan to retire at age 55.  Before these events, company policy was the ability to take early retirement at age 55 with at least 20 years of service.  I ended up retiring at age 52 with 22 years service after they were bought by another company.",

If you pick a cheap large cap index fund, you will probably invest it at a better return than the plan assumptions.  And annuities go only to you and maybe your survivor (usually spouse) but not your other estate.

How much did you pay for it on average compared to 401k? I am thinking, if you had contributed to 401k all your life, and had 1 million in it during retirement, withdrawing 100k would last 30 years (assuming near 10% returns). \nIf you had contributed more and had 2 mill when you retire in your 401k, you could live off of the interest (4% rule). When you die, your kids will get a massive payout. With pension, your kids don\u2019t get anything. Right?\n\nWhy is investing in pension better than 401k?\n\nI think your pension is better if amount you put in month after month is less than what would be needed to fund a 401k to $1 million. If it\u2019s more you come off worse by picking pensions over 401k",

My total contribution stopped after I worked 8 years full time (I bought back two years at a lower rate from when I was a student)... I think it was $25k or something like that... 3% per year for those eight years. After that I took the 3% and put it in my deferred comp plan pre-tax... I've been increasing the amount over the years and now put 15% in... I should max out the contribution on that in the next year\n3. my kids do not get anything from my pension, my wife will collect though...  You could select a child to get the survivors benefits as it doesn't have to be a spouse... My father-in-law did this and my sister-in-law and she will collect $45k a year for the rest of her life when he passes... I should have around $750k in other accounts so my kids will be fine... \n\nFor NY the pension is the right choice if you plan to stay working for the state for 30 years... It's also not as good as it was... new employees have to wait until 63 (I can retire at 55) and I think the percentage per year is lower... but it is still a good gig... to get an annuity (don't recommend them just as an example) to pay my pension would probably be $1.5 million...",

Bethlehem Steel was once the richest and flashiest company in the country and you can see how that worked out for their pensioned workers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is just too much  volatility in our economy.

There are a bunch of rules on holding employer securities in the trust, so it's uncommon in DB-only trusts. It's not really like holding employer stock, but it is more generally like keeping all your eggs in one basket.\n\nGovernmental trusts are exempt from ERISA. They are sometimes less trustworthy because their accounting is sometimes sloppy and their growth assumptions are sometimes unrealistic. But they're backed by taxing power and often guaranteed by state law, so they're usually a much bigger threat to state taxpayers than to plan participants.",

By assuming a very exponential growth of the funds used to eventually pay the pension, they pushed the present value down and paid out very little compared to the pension the employees had been expecting.

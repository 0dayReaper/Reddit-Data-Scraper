    "postText": "I was owed a federal tax refund for the 2018 tax year, which was due in April 2019. I mailed the return on April 15, 2022, just within the three year statute of limitation period for filing returns late but still receiving a refund.  \nOn April 17, 2023, I received a CP12 notice from the IRS telling me that I had claimed a deduction on the 2018 return but had not attached a Schedule 1 form indicating from where the deduction was from (it was for state taxes, the number I had used was the same number which was printed on my W2 but I might not have remembered to fill a Schedule 1 form).  \nI had expected a return of around USD 3000, accounting for the deduction. The letter said that since I didn't have any documentation explaining the deduction, they had \"corrected\" my return to remove the deduction and that I was instead due around USD 2000. However, they then said in their letter that since more than three years had passed since the return was due, that I was ineligible to receive any of the refund.  \nSince I mailed the return within the three year mark, is there no way for me to get at least the USD 2000? I used certified mail and can prove that I had sent the letter on April 15, 2022. I have until next weekend to contest and was hoping that someone here might have some advice. Thanks in advance.",

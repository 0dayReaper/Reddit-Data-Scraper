    "postText": "My son and I received 100k from my late husband's life insurance. I currently owe about 18K for my car, have about 6 to 8k in credit card debt. My son will be receiving about 2k a month in survivors benefits. We are currently moving to my parents home to cut costs and will probably pay about $2000 a month to help out with mortgage, bills, food, etc. Most likely less than that, but I am over budgeting just in case. I currently make a little over $2,000 a month. I have 20,000 in a savings account that gives 4% interest. \n\n\nHonestly this is the first time ever in my life I've had so much money but I'm not sure what to do. Any advice? I'm trying my best to secure my son and my future.\n\nETA:\n\nThank you all for your advice. I do plan on using the money wisely and not falling back into debt. I want to make my husband proud of me, even if he is gone.\n\nI also wanted to add some info:\n\nMost of the debt went to medical bills my husband had before he died. He didn't want to touch our savings as he thought we would have a chance to pay off our credit card debt within the next few months. His death was completely unexpected as it was a car accident.\n\n\nThe $2k is for all of my son and I's bills, not just for my parents. I do have opportunities at work to increase my pay, which I will begin to work towards once I am certain my son is settled and in a better state of mind. \n\n\nI am fortunate enough to be able to move it back in with my parents, and have enough space that all of us can live comfortably. Rent for a one-bedroom apartment in my area is at minimum $1,500 a month not including utilities, and I definitely cannot afford to purchase a home at the moment.",

You will have a lot left over, and you'll be able to cover your expenses between your income and benefits.\n\nI'll leave it to others for advice on how to invest, but I would look into eventually earning more money and moving back out on your own, when you finally feel up to it. But that will come in time.",

I  just started working full-time this year prior to my husband death. They have been amazing with me and very considerate with my situation. I am planning on taking some certification classes that will help me get bigger pay bumps sooner.\n\nIt was my intention to quickly move out of my parents home but the more I think of it, the more I feel like I should take my time. The market to buy in south Florida is insane and the rent is ridiculously high. The average 1 bedroom apartment is about $1500, not including utilities. At my parents, we each have our own rooms and my son has his own space to play. It'll also be nice to be around family for a bit, while I can take some time to grieve.\n\nThank you so much.",

Pay off your credit cards fully, and going forward try to use a credit card as a debit card: no balances left, just use it to the amounts you can afford to pay off each month.\n\n2. Nowadays there has been a spurt of high interest savings accounts on offer from various banks, sometimes above 4%. Move most of your cash there while you figure out how to invest it. \n\n3. Pay off the car loan only if the interest rate on it is above the rate on the above mentioned savings account.",

Maybe a sporting event he would like or a cabin get away you both could enjoy. Lots of things can be figured out floating in a small lake in a rental kayak. \n\nSounds like, short term, you have things sorted as to living arrangements, etc. so no need to rush things.

Use what you need to for the move, such as to rent a truck or movers if your parents can't help out.  \n  \nTake time to mourn.  \n  \nAssuming your husband also had a vehicle, and that you inherited all of his property, you'll need to go through all of that, keep what you want, give your son what he wants, and likely sell the rest.  You can put it in storage for a while if you aren't ready to do this.  \n  \nIt sounds like the two of you can live on your income, at your parents', while your son's benefits could go partly into a 529 post-secondary education account, partly to build up a cash fund for him, and partly to help make his childhood better.  Consider using part of it on a trip to a national park, or to a convention he's interested in, something that you and he (and your parents, if you wish) can do together.  \n  \nFor the rest of the inheritance, you should invest it for your retirement.  That's really the best thing you can do to help yourself *and* your son, because it means you won't rely on him when you're older, freeing him to lead his own life.  Follow the guides on the sidebar for windfall to know how to invest it appropriately (i.e. likely, putting it into a Roth IRA based on your earned income).  \n  \nGood luck.",

So sorry for your loss. \n\nMoving in with your parents isn't a bad idea while you plan the next steps for you and your son. I think it's important to pay off any credit card debt, personal loans, student loans, and auto loans during this reprieve with ma and pa. Any debt besides a mortgage should be paid off.\n\nAfter paying off these debts, I'd place the remaining funds into a high-yield savings account. Many are paying above 4% APY, but you'll have to search outside the big banks like J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America. Their interest rates on savings accounts aren't worth it. \n\nYou can also place some funds in a 529 fund for your son's future. It'll be a boon to his finances if he decides to attend higher education or trade school down the road. \n\nYou can also open a Roth IRA and begin making the annual contributions towards your retirement, capped at $6,000 dollars per year. \n\nI hope these provide some concrete ideas for you and your son. It's a huge weight being a widowed mother. But you sound ready and capable of the challenges ahead. You'll do fine. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

Can\u2019t imagine how difficult it must be but glad you and your late husband had insurance to help. \n\nI would get rid of all debt, cc and car payment, first. Put the rest in the savings account and leave it for now until maybe 6-12 months when you feel you\u2019ve been able to grieve properly and are ready to make big financial decisions. If you want to move to a house at that point you can figure it out at that time instead of rushing into anything.",

You might even consider two accounts: one emergency fund (I recommend 6-12 months of expenses since you have a kid) and the other to give you time to figure out what you want to do with it re: investing and stuff. Either way, earmark enough money for an emergency fund and do not invest that money, you want easy cash at hand should an emergency pop up.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got the headspace for it, look into investments/retirement funds and figure out what you want to do with non-efund money. \n\nWhile a 529 account for your son is an idea, one downside is that those funds must be used for education expenses, so if your son decides not to go to school after high school that money is sort of tied up. You can get it out, but I believe you pay a penalty if it\u2019s not for educational use",

He had an excellent career and made very good money, health insurance provided for the whole family, pension, etc.\n\n\nWhenever my son would ask if he had to go to college because he hates school (he is only 8 so of course this can change), we would always tell him that it isn't for everyone but that he could also go to trade school for something that interests him and he would say he could work with his hands and brains like daddy.\n\n\nI'm not sure if it may be smarter to put the money into a high yield savings and let him decide how he can use the money when he is ready.",

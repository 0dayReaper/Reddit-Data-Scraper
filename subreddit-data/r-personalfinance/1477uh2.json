I see that there are bonds, ETFs, etc. idk what all those terms mean. Is there a book to learn about this? Basically, I want to invest my Roth IRA in something that\u2019s for a long term, basically I will just leave it there and not touch it until 59 1/2.",

This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Broad market ETFs for the win.",

The advantage of this type of account is at 59 1/2 you can withdraw the funds for retirement with no tax penalty compared to a Traditional IRA!\n\nNow, when it comes to investing, what is your strategy?\n\nCapital preservation? Aggressive growth? Strategies largely come down to 3 things: risk aversion, age, and capital size.\n\nIf you're young, don't put your money into to say bonds or other government-backed securities such as T-bills. These assets normally require large amounts of capital for them to be effect. Those in retirement utilize these tools because they are less volatile with decent returns to sustain their monthly or annual living expenses.\n\nDon't bother picking out individual stocks as this requires advanced research and market understanding.\n\nVanguard and Fidelity are the two most common investment management companies. With an account, research index funds within the Roth IRA. There are different ones to choose from. Select which one which suits your needs best and then make the contributions!\n\nFor more information on Vanguard's website about Roth IRA's, click [here](https://investor.vanguard.com/accounts-plans/iras/roth-ira).\n\nTo browse Vanguard's index funds, click [here](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/index-funds).",

    "postText": "Im moving to a MCOL city and am struggling to find a 1 bed for under 1.3k. My take home pay will be $5100/month so I figured I should find a place at or under 1.3k since that is 25% of my take home which I constantly hear about. I\u2019ve asked five different (random) people at my company to room with me and they have either denied the request or didn\u2019t respond. Is there a good way to find a roommate? Should I just suck it up and be willing to spend more on an an apartment? I\u2019m trying to avoid having a car so I will at least be saving money on that front\n\nUpdated: 1. the people I was messaging from my work were on a list of people who are also looking for roommates and starting the same entry level program as me. 2. I would really prefer not to be in a studio since two days of the week I\u2019ll be WFH",

I'd ask potential coworkers not to room with you, but if they have advice on what a reasonable budget is or a good area to live.\n\n25% of net pay on housing is very conservative and not possible in many places.  Many people will go as high as 33% of gross pay.  You mention that you won't have a car, which is a sign that you can likely go a bit higher.  How much debt you have is another major factor.",

I faced my bed away from the desk as well so that I'd have no issues sleeping. Definitely look up how people arrange their space, I've seen a lot of creative methods!",

His take home is around $6K and his rent is $2200 no utilities. I found him a 3/1 900sq ft with public transit in front of the door. It is not updated but he's not into 'decor'. It is clean, freshly painted and everything works, quiet, safe neighborhood. Very responsive private landlord (they didn't even raise the rent when the first year was up). He wanted an 'office' for Hybrid days and a guest room when family or friends come. 'I' wanted him to have an extra room in case life got too expensive and he could have a room mate option. Also made sure it was allowed in the lease. \n\nSo make sure you take utilities into consideration when looking so you're comparing apples to apples. I found his on [Realtor.com](https://Realtor.com) (not many people think of them for rentals), his other choice I found on Zillow (that one was tough for parking, he doesn't use his car more than every couple of weeks but he has a spot in front of the house).",

It won't be the nicest or newest, but there should be ***something***.\n\nRoommates might be a good idea, but based on your entry-level salary, most of the people at your company are probably of a social class that is not accustomed to roommates, so I can understand why you've gotten no takers. I admit that I have no idea how to find roommates myself.\n\nMake sure to look in multiple places for apartments. Craigslist apartments are usually cheaper than Zillow. Some landlords just post signs in front of the property, though that's probably not an option for someone moving in from out of town.\n\nIt also sounds like you might be trying to live within walking distance of your \\[downtown?\\] office. Even most American cities have at least a few functioning transit lines. Find out where those are, and see you if can find a decently walkable neighborhood 5 miles away or something.\n\nI would not increase your budget. I had to spend about 25% of my income on my first apartment, and I wouldn't recommend going above that. The fact that so many people have to is a clear sign of creeping poverty. And, for reference, I did not then and do not now own a car, so my opinion is already calibrated to not wasting money on a car. You should adjust your budget down if you end up needing to get one.",

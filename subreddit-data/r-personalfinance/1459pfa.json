    "postText": "Wife and I hired a financial advisor who came recommended by a co-worker. She had a flat fee of 3k in the start (which I initially assumed was yearly) but at this point we're not paying her. This makes me suspicious of her motivation. I've read about the massive kickbacks they get by selling these packages and the conflict of interest makes me uneasy. I'd like to as you all what you think, does having some insurance make sense? Are we over-insured? Underinsured? What's your take?\n\nShe's sold us several packages, all with the same insurance company (guardian). She had us set up a trust, this was new, but made sense to me. Then came the insurance packages. First renters insurance (\\~10 per month), then Individual disability (\\~110 per month), Term Life Insurance (\\~70 per month) and Whole life 99 (\\~1760 per month - it was explained to us as a savings account). Mind you this is only for me, we did the same for my wife. \n\nI'm not sure if this much insurance makes sense. If these packages make sense. I used to take the same amount we put into Whole life 99 and put it into low cost index funds. We've been told we're not differentiating enough (since most of VOO is tech companies). I kinda get that, but no alternative (apart from that insurance deal) was given. Recently we've been introduced to Annuities - which when explained made me take a step back and re-evaluate everything. \n\nBefore I start tearing this thing apart, I wanted to hear more opinions - just so I know if I'm being paranoid, or if my gut is correct by raising red flags.",

What's the death benefit on the term? \n\nThe disability is most likely not needed, and the Whole Life is DEFINITELY not needed. \n\nCancel the Whole Life for sure. Like today. And probably cancel the Disability as well. \n\nHere is an article explaining why Whole Life doesn't make sense for the vast majority of people (including yourself and your wife): \n\nhttps://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/debunking-the-myths-of-whole-life-insurance/",

Keep term insurance, but look around to see if you are overpaying. A key point with that is the length of the insurance.  Disability seems way too high/costly, that should be about 1 or 2% of your income.\n\nI have no idea why you need a trust set up.\n\nThe problem isn't that you are paranoid,  it is that you are not paranoid enough.\n\nThere is no way you should be paying someone over $3000/year to take your money.",

This means that you can cancel the policy and get all your money back.\n\nIf you've past the free look period, then there is likely a surrender change.  I'm guessing that charge will be more than the amount you've already put into the policy.  So if you cancel the policy, you won't get anything back but won't be responsible for coming out of pocket to pay the remaining surrender balance.",

This is contrary to term insurance, where the insurance remain active only for a certain amount of time (10 years, 20 years, etc...).  \n\nFirst an foremost: Permanent life insurance is a form of protection.  Of insurance.   \n \n\nHowever, one of the adjunct benefits is that the underlying investments (where a portion of your monthly premium goes) get appreciate in value, tax-deferred.  This is simliar to your 401k/IRA.  So having tax-free growth can be compelling for some.  \n\nAnd if structured/set up correctly, a consumer can take out 'loans' from the insurance policy, tax-free.  So these policies are 'sold' as:  Hey, you need insurance to protect your family.  But investments within a whole life can grow tax-deferred, and you can take the money out tax-free.",

If not now, maybe this reliance would occur in the future?\n\nRenter's Insurance: $10/mo sounds reasonable.  I'm not trying to spend your money, but this is a no brainer.\n\nIndividual Disability: I believe this is under-appreciated.  Your ability to earn income is your biggest asset.  If you were disabaled, you may not be able to work or earn a paycheck.  The cost of DI correlates within your current income.  (Age and occupation as well)\n\nTerm: Seems affordable, depending on the coverage.  \n\nWhole life: This is 'sold' as another retirement vehicle.  i.e. after making out your 401k, IRA, HSA, etc.. then this is a tax-deferred vehicle to save for retirement.  Then if structured correctly, then this may provide tax-free retirement income.  Most consumers rarely see the benefits of this.  \n\nIt seems excessive, the premium.",

Remember: Part of the monthly premium for Whole Life is commission for the salesperson. Wouldn't you rather keep that commission payment for yourself, and invest it instead? Put another way: Between you and your wife, you'd have $3,520 extra PER MONTH to put into the market. Do the math on $42,240 per year earning an average of 7% growth from now until retirement age. There's your answer.",

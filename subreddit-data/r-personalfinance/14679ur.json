    "postText": "My base income is very close to Roth IRA contributions limits. I will only know whether or not I exceed the limits in November when I will the get the bonus. I want to max it out in the meantime.\nMy question is can I contribute to traditional IRA now and then use back door Roth IRA just to be safe?\nare there any penalties to use back door in case my income stays under the contribution limits?",

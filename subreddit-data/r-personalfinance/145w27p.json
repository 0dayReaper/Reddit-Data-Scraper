The only thing that's differed from my usual routine this past month is that I'm in a different country rn so I haven't been using my credit card. Can that also affect your credit score? \n\nMy score went from 742 to 702 for no apparent reason. I am understandably concerned. \n\nAny guesses as to why?",

Lowering your credit limit is also in the cards and they will just inform you without letting you contest, and that does also affect your credit score.\n\nIf getting a mortgage in the US is in the cards for later, $3 a month for a subscription you're already gonna pay for and reducing the chances for your score to go down means potentially thousands saved in interest over the course of the loan.\n\nAnd yes, I live abroad and also speak with many friends that have repatriated to the US had similar issues because they didn't use their cards here and now are having higher interest rates for their loans in the US than they should have. $180 over 5 years is essentially meaningless in the grand scheme and less so if you're actually using the service.",

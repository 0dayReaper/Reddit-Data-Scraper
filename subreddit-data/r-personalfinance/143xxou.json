    "postText": "I want to buy a camper with all cash. They are ~4k more expensive if I don\u2019t finance. The sales guys tell me I can pay them off right away and that they are passing the savings on to me but I don\u2019t believe it.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to be in the fine print? Some crazy finance fee?\n\nOn another note, I\u2019m amazed at how much people spend and finance on these RV\u2019s\u2026. Some people must carry so much debt around.",

Many car rebates are dependent on taking manufacturer financing too.\n\nLike the dealer said, just take it and refinance or pay it off, but read the fine print to be sure there\u2019s no prepayment penalty.",

But the sales person doesn't benefit from that kickback, just from the actual sale, so he could not care less if you pay it in full the next day.\n\nThe only thing that matters to you is that there is no prepayment penalty whatsoever. Ask to see the financing documents ahead of time and look for that. If there is, well that is what I would call a poison pill.",

    "postText": "Someone tried to scam me in a way I haven't heard of before. Here's what happened:\n\nI posted an item for sale around 9:30 pm. About 30 minutes later, I get this text:\n\n&gt;Hello!!  I wanna Buy your *[CL post title]*\n&gt;. Can i call you?\n\nThe fact that they asked if they could call instead of just calling didn't seem too odd since it was after 10pm, but the timing of the text so soon after I posted the ad set off a red flag.\n\nThe text came from my area code, so I thought maybe it was legit.\n\nI replied \"sure\" and then they texted:\n\n&gt;okk Bro... But..Now a days there are many scammer in Craiglist.\n&gt; So i will verify you.\n&gt;I just sent you a scammer verification G-code on your phone inbox.\n&gt; So Tell me the code.Then i call you now.\n\nRight at the same time, I get this:\n\n&gt;*[6 digit number]* adalah kode verifikasi Google Voice Anda. Jangan bagikan kode ini kepada siapa pun. *[Google url]*\n\nThis text came from Google's number they use to verify your number for Google Voice services. I don't even know what language this is.\n\nCoincidentally, I had re-verified my number about a week ago, so right above this text, I could see this one from the same number:\n\n&gt;*[6 digit number]* is your Google Voice verification code. Don't share it with anyone else. *[Google url]*\n\nSo the scammers were hoping I wouldn't understand that giving them the 6 digit number would give them access to my Google Voice account, which then could probably be used to access my email or other accounts.\n\nSending the Google verification text in a foreign language was an interesting twist, as the recipient wouldn't understand that it says \"Don't share it with anyone else.\"\n\nThey sent one more text:\n\n&gt;Tell me the code plz..??\n\nThen I blocked the number.\n\nAnybody else seen this?",

            "comment": "I am going to shamelessly plug proper two factor authentication for your google account here in a sticky, because it's worth repeating.  First, there are some good tips [in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft#wiki_things_you_should_do_to_protect_your_information_in_the_future).\n\nSecond, in order to protect your account against phishing, you should enable u2f two factor authentication with a physical key: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523\n\nYou can get u2f keys for like $10.  Buy a couple, and store one in a safe place.  **Print your backup codes, and save them in a bank safety deposit box if you have one**.  And then disable SMS fallback option (only after you are absolutely sure you won't lose your backup codes).\n\nYou can use the same key on multiple websites - Twitter, Facebook, Fastmail, Dropbox, and Vanguard.  There's a relatively up to date list here: https://www.dongleauth.info/.",

Not gatekeeping but everyone stayed away because it was weird and ugly when, in fact, it was huge inside. I could take the back seats out individually (ended up running with just one back seat most of the time) and the cargo space was fantastic. I was able to fit surprisingly large cargo items in it which is great because I love antique furniture and often buy before I consider how I\u2019m getting it home.\n\nYes, they were obviously smoking several non-compatible drugs at once when they designed it and there are glaring imperfections (back hatched design vs. functionality wtf??) but it was the most utilitarian car I\u2019ve ever had. Excellent ground clearance and I took it semi-off-roading more than once. She jumped curbs with no problems and I was able to drive her down a 4x4 trail without getting stuck.\n\nI was in the middle of restoring her when the floods came. She had new headlights, new rear lights, a new windshield, new pneumatic jacks for the rear hatch, and I\u2019d hunted down some missing interior pieces in junkyards.\n\nUm...so...yeah. Azteks are kinda cool. I miss mine.",

The check looked like what you would get from your employer. It was perforated at the top, everything was typed, the company's name and address were legit, the bank and address was legit, the routing number was legit. However, due to the circumstance, I told the teller that I suspected fraud and he went and made a few calls. Turns out everything on the check added up including the amount of money and the account number. The thing is that about 50 other tellers had called up the branch that printed these checks and it was becoming clear that somebody somehow got this bank to give them a bunch of checks with this company's info and if I had cashed it, it would have bounced some time later. So, no. You cannot. This was an actual check printed by an actual bank. But, if it's still business hours in whatever time zone that the branch is that the check was printed at and/or is that customer's main branch, their fraud/security can help to verify the check for you.",

In that time, they wrote various checks for $2500.  Luckily, we were reimbursed, but we had to close the account and start a new one. I was standing at the bank counter while they took care of it, and the woman said something about how easy it would be to print bogus checks- meanwhile, she turned around and pulled my new temporary checks off of the laser jet printer behind her. Yes, things have changed a lot since then. But my point is that a name and address on a check don't really mean much security-wise.",

They aren't, not even close. \n\nIt's why the scam usually involves someone mailing you the check, asking you to deposit it in your bank account, and send them some amount less than the full check \"for your trouble\".\n\nThe only cashier's check you should ever accept is one that you personally witness the bank teller issuing to the buyer.",

Not only do they often not quite fit my resume (why do companies include mandatory full date fields? Like, no I don't remember which day in June that was!), but they obscure the work someone puts into presentation.\n\nI think part of why an uploaded resume is better for everyone is that you can see a clear demonstration of at least one of my skills, right there. I realize word processing seems like a low bar, but as you clearly know, it isn't as low as you'd think.\n\nMore than any other reason though, forms suck because it means instead of being able to upload and answer a few questions, I have to spend an hour plus just retyping info into it.

It's a rare identifier that potentially sticks with you for life. Googling your name plus phone number can bring up all sorts of corroborating information.\n\n A week after that, our national broadcaster had a show on a new-to-me scam called, I think, port forwarding out. Armed with not much more than your phone number, scammers take control of your cell number and transfer it to their phone. That done, they now have control of most of your two-factor verification, often along with your email, anything in your cloud, amazon accounts, etc, and they move quickly to change passwords. Do you store your credit information on ebay? Amazon? What's your spending limit if somebody wanted to buy themselves gift cards, there? Check out CBC's recent program on port forwarding, it was pretty interesting",

It's quite prevalent because it's very easy to port numbers with the most basic information you can find on google. You don't even need to pay for database services. You just need to have some social engineering skills and keep trying to port it over until someone finally does. \n\nSecurity on phone numbers and SMS is laughably archaic. I've only found two solutions:\n\n1) get hacked so many times you threaten to sue the phone company for disclosing personal information and get a written letter by a vice president saying your number is locked. The same protocol they use for government officials, but apparently it can't be for \"us normal people\" unless you press hard enough. \n\n2) use google fi, the only carrier that allows you to lock the number behind 2 factor authentication. Real 2fa using hardware. Not SMS.",

The rare scam attempt I receive now I report to CL via the link in the email and they very likely instantly nuke those accounts.\n\nIt's more of a pain for both me and my buyers to force them to initiate contact via email, but I avoid the scammers this way.\n\nAlso, since CL started charging $5 for autos the number of scam ads for cars/trucks has dropped to basically to zero.  At one point probably 20% of all auto ads on CL were scams.",

    "postText": "Recently consolidated my debt $33,000 @ 12.5% interest on a 24 month term. I have a stable job and make about $75k a year after tax. \n\nRecently my car (which I didn\u2019t owe money on) was totaled. I purchased it from a friend for 12k cash and I\u2019m getting 19k for it. \n\n My coworker is selling me a car that is mechanically sound. (I have extensive years of automotive experience). The only downside is that visually it\u2019s a piece of crap. The seats are torn, radio doesn\u2019t work, faded paint. However, it will not leave me stranded for at least 5years. \n\n1) I don\u2019t know if I should buy the car he\u2019s selling it for $4,500 and put the rest toward the loan (I have zero money in savings)\n\n2) Buy the car for $4,500 and save some money (don\u2019t know how much) and use the rest to pay on the loan \n\n3) Buy a $10k car in better shape and pay the rest on the loan. \n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.",

You will get a better interest rate on a car loan vs. personal loan anyway.",

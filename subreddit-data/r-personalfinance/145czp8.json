If you aren't sure how to fill out the W-4 properly, use the [IRS withholding estimator](https://www.irs.gov/w4app). This is particularly important to get right if your household has more than 1 source of income.",

Are you adding extra withholding to cover the double dipping of the standard deduction? If so, then you would just add 2000 in section 3 of your w4. She does not change her w4.   \n\n\nIf you are both withholding at the married rate, and did not address the dual income situation, than more needs to be done with your w4 forms.",

Right now you are each utilizing half the married standard deduction and tax brackets by using the \"single\" setting.  \n\n\nIf you switch to \"married\" you'll be applying the full married standard deduction, and she'll be applying 1/2, which is 1.5 total, but in reality you only get 1.   \n\n\nThat is why I say if you switch to the married setting, you need to also add some additional withholding to make up for that.",

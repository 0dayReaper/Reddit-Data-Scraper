(Combination of blue-chip stocks and total market and index fund)\n\n40% - HYSA (I get 4.5% APY)\n\n10% - Checking/savings\n\nI don't pay any bills and my only expenses will be gas, going out and maybe groceries when I go back to college.",

Personally I pay everything with CC, and on payday I pay the CC bill, recalculate the very unchanging expenses that are paid on the checking account each month, with a small buffer for unforeseen small things, and push the rest to savings (whether investment, HYSA, etc). Some months (vacations, big expenses\u2026) I\u2019ll be pulling from savings instead, and that\u2019s OK if it was foreseen.\n\nYou may have irregular expenses and irregular income that force you to keep a bigger buffer in checking, but to me it doesn\u2019t make sense to me to calculate it as a percentage of your total.",

Then, once in college, I was worried about grades, beer, and girls.\n\nWith what I know now, I would put the HYSA at 10%, checking/savings at 10%, and the rest would be all stocks.  In 50 years, you will look back and be very happy.",

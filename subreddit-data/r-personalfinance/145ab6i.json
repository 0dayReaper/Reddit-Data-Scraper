The terminology can be hazy - there's wage garnishment (basically taking money from your employer), and then there's the ability to reach into your account (also sometimes called garnishment, or levy). Because that's a risk.\n\nThere's also the possibility of them obtaining a lien to place on your home, depending on state.\n\nSuing and obtaining a judgment in many states gives right to collect up to 10 years, during which your own circumstances can change. The state in question would certainly be useful to know, as would the amount of judgment.",

Nothing illegal about that unless you have an actual court order saying not to do that (for garnishment they usually go behind your back direct to the bank) Of course if they drag you to court and ask about your assets (called a debtor's exam) you shouldn't lie that you have $10k cash under your mattress and they may get court order to turn over that cash. Never ignore a legal court order!\n\nAlso there's nothing illegal about getting out your cash and using it for living expenses while your spouse just keeps saving money that creditors can't touch.\n\nBut yea it doesn't legally protect your assets, it just buys you time but that could just mean spending YOUR money on YOUR living expenses instead of giving it away to creditors. It's not going to protect someone who has $200k in the bank and then gives it to their spouse, but in this case if OP has $10k in the bank it might stall things long enough to legally spend on groceries and gas.",

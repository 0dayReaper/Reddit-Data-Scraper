            "comment": "This depends on how you go about transferring from the old brokerage to the new brokerage.  If you do a \u201ccash transfer,\u201d then you sell the shares in the old account (and realize any gains/losses in comparison to your cost basis) for cash and transfer said cash to new brokerage account.  This method would mean you no longer own your shares and lose out on any gains/losses after the sale.  If you do an \u201cin-kind transfer,\u201d then your shares move from the old brokerage to the new brokerage.  This happens via Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS).  In most cases, the cost basis will automatically transfer over.  With this second method, you still own your shares throughout the duration of the transfer and subsequently see gains/losses in the share price.  Just know that your shares are unavailable for sale while they\u2019re in the transfer process.  So if they somehow spike in price while they\u2019re being moved and you want to sell, well you\u2019re out of luck and have to wait until the move clears ACATS.",

You cannot sell them during the transition period, so it's a moot point to worry about.\n\nEdit: Prices are set by the market, not by a particular brokerage.

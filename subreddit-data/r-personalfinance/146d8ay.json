With one of our cats getting sick out of nowhere and the vet bill being ~3k, it got me wondering if pet insurance could save my family money in the long run. I want the best for my pets but I neither know what to do nor have the ability to make decisions since I'm not the one bringing in money. It would break my heart to lose one of my cats or my dog from something we could've prevented. If additional information would be helpful (location, total income, etc), I'll be glad to provide it. Thank you very much\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the responses! I'm going to ask my parents if they have any money they could put away monthly for emergency vet situations (and if they don't now, ask if it could be a possibility in the future) given it doesn't sound like insurance is all that worth it at this point. I seriously appreciate everyone who replied and gave me advice. Thank you guys so much :)",

Most of them were adopted as adults, so their premiums would be higher to start.  \n\nI decided it was better to put the potential premiums into a savings account and made a pet emergency fund (I have many pets to this will differ for everyone).  It seemed to make more sense to spend the money on vet bills as needed.  This fund is in addition to my real emergency fund for just about anything else. \n\nIn the case of an extremely large bill, I recommend Care Credit.  It\u2019s usually 0% interest for a year or 2 depending  on the amount.  As long as you can pay that off in time you avoid the high interest it accrues.  In case you are wondering why it can be 0% interest, the vet (or dentist in my case) has to pay about a 10% fee for the patient to use that service.  \n\nTL/DR: instead of paying pet insurance premiums, use that money to put into a pet emergency savings account.",

And there are a bunch of gotchas like in network vs out of network and limits. \n\nIf one of your pets needed a $5k surgery, can you either afford it or would you be willing to euthanize them?",

Obviously, there's a chance, but the overwhelming majority of healthy cats are healthy until the day they die. \n\nTake your example of a $3k bill for a cat and someone's quote of $150/yr/cat for cat insurance. You have 5 cats. That's $750/yr for all 5 cats. After 3.5 years, you'd have spent $3k on insurance. Healthy indoor cats live 12+ years very conservatively. After 12 years for 5 cats, you'll have paid $9k in insurance. That would be enough for that $3k surgery on 60% of your cats. Statistically, it is an extremely unlikely event. \n\nInstead of buying insurance, quote yourself some insurance and then just pay that into an \"emergency pet fund\". \n\nMost people get insurance because they're afraid of a couple thousand dollar expense, but with how many pets you have, paying yourself an insurance premium will get you a decent emergency fund in a year or two.",

Their entire reason for existing is to maximize premiums collected while minimizing how much they have to pay out. They don\u2019t give AF about your pet. \n\nEverything and anything on file will become a \u201cpre-existing\u201d condition, especially at the age of your pets, and will be used to deny coverage.\n\nThe only time I\u2019d ever recommend pet insurance is if you have a breed with known health conditions *and* you get it before/during their very first vet appointment. Even then\u2026 I still think you\u2019re better off simply saving for the inevitable. \n\nI say this as someone that owns a Great Pyrenees and put out $5k for a replacement knee.

She\u2019s 13 now and pre existing conditions wouldn\u2019t be covered. I did get insurance when I got another puppy who is now 2. It started at $34/mo and just went up to $36/mo. $250 annual deductible and 90% reimbursement. No annual limits. The only thing not covered is regular wellness/preventative care which is easy to budget for. Last year she ate something and needed emergency surgery for a blockage. Insurance reimbursed me almost $1,500. I would have had to save $175/mo starting when I got her just to have enough for that one emergency. If something else happened soon after then I wouldn\u2019t have had time to build back my savings. \n\nFor me, it\u2019s worth it just for peace of mind and budgeting ease. I keep $500 set aside for the deductible and 10% coinsurance which would cover a $2,500 vet bill. I budget separately for yearly exams and shots. My last dog had a tumor on his spleen that required emergency surgery and it ended up being a very aggressive form of cancer. The surgery and continued treatment only gave me another 3.5 months with him and it cost me thousands. I don\u2019t regret it at all but knowing I\u2019ll never have to make treatment decisions based on finances with my younger dog is worth it. \n\nIt\u2019s best to get insurance when the dog/cat is young or if they don\u2019t have any pre existing conditions. Not sure where you live but insurance for cats is cheaper than dogs here so maybe consider getting it for the younger ones if they don\u2019t have any medical issues right now. You typically get a multi pet discount as well. Adding a 5 year old cat to my policy with a $250 deductible and 80% reimbursement is $23/month. I use Healthy Paws.",

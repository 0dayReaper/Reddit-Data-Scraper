Call whoever your provider is and they\u2019ll tell you how to make it happen.\n\nETA: Check the list of CA counties the emergency declaration applies to. There are like four excluded so if you\u2019re in one of those you\u2019re SOL",

Just invest it in a brokerage account or with a mutual fund company like vanguard, or put it in a HYSA and invest it on Jan 1. A half a year delay of investing 6k in a roth will not have a material impact on your long term success. Glad you got rid of that debt though, and It was a good question to ask!",

That means he's only missing about \\~0.5 to 1.5 years of 'earlier' growth, which is not much in my opinion in the grand scheme of saving for retirement. It's even less if he just invests it in a brokerage account today and then maxes out the roth ira in january for next year.",

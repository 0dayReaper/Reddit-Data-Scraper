They are both variable and dependent on the current rates, but &lt;85% LTV on the home is ~7% and &gt;85% LTV is ~9% right now, so verify the rates and see if there is a reason to go with a smaller amount. Other than that, I don't see a reason why not, as long as there aren't monthly fees. We had one open for about 3 years without using it. Cost a couple hundred to open and then gave us a $39,000 cushion if we ever had an emergency.",

This sub is very against credit cards and open credit in general. But if you are responsible with your money, there's not really a reason to not, provided it doesn't cost you money to have open. I believe some places charge monthly if it has a zero balance, so definitely verify that.",

            "comment": "There can be some benefits for only getting a lower limit vs whatever max you'd qualify for.\n\nLike another poster said, a lender may have different \"tiers\" of HELOC with different rates depending on your overall loan-to-value (counting both your primary mortgage + HELOC limit).  Best as I can tell, the rate (or more commonly some benchmark +/- a fixed value) is determined by the total limit selected when you close, not how much you actually draw from it and not changed if home value increases.  My credit union has a one HELOC rate for LTV under 80%, a higher one for 80-90%, and won't approve HELOCs above 90%.\n\nWhen I got my HELOC, the credit union waived the need for an full appraisal if I kept LTV under 70%.  IIRC, they based the home valuation using things like public comps + tax assessment.  This saved me about $3-500 in appraisal costs, and we didn't need that extra 10% anyway.\n\nThen there's the temptation factor.  Some people may not be able to resist the \"cheap\" borrowing available from unused HELOC limit.  While it's better than racking up credit card balances, that's still a problematic path.  Putting a self-imposed limit by just applying for what you need could help with that.",

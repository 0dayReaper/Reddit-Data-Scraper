    "postText": "Hey everyone, 30m here in the US. I put $2000 into an HSA at an old job with Cigna. Never activated / don't have the debit card. Cigna says if you are no longer a Cigna customer I have to go to mychoicefund. My choice fund tells me they don't have an account it was transferred to HSA Bank, HSA bank says they have no account for me.\n\nDo I have any hope of getting this? Have an old email from Cigna about a \"IRS 5498-SA Tax Form\" being available, could I track it from that? I've been at this for over a year, calling around every few months or so. Thanks in advance",

An internet search is also quite unrevealing.",

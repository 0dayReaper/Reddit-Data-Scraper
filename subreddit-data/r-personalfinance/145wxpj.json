    "postText": "So it comes to a point where i cant keep up with a payments and getting loads of debt collectors letters..thinking of going bankrupt..I got car which i use for work as working as driver, so this i understand can stay with me and its not a fancy car. But what about my house hold items? I renting property, will trusty or who ever else will come to my house to see what i have and if he decides that washing mashine or tv is too good so he will sell it and replace it with cheaper ones? I cant even think that someone comes to my house and start taking or valuing things up (just makes me paranoid) As i dont own house my only asset is car from my understanding? And will it affect my rental property? (I am not behind any payments as i been adviced to pay rent and bill as priority before paying debts). My current situation is that there is much less work and 2 months ago i even had to apply for benefits which got approved and i got first payment last month. Jezz what a situation i am in, never though this will happen to me, and its so stressful. Maybe bankruptcy is easier than i think and would help with my current state of mind",

            "comment": "In my district, bankruptcy is easier than you are thinking. When I worked for a Chaper 7 Trustee, we may have sent someone to a house to look at personal property 1 out of 100 cases and I cannot recall a time we valued property at a rental property. A bankruptcy should not bother your current lease. Securing a new rental in the future may be more difficult if your credit is checked.\n\nPlease continue paying your rent, car payment and other monthly utilities. \n\nIt is likely worth reaching out to an attorney for a consultation - likely free. Ask around for recommendations or call a Trustee in your district for a list of local attorneys.",

Consult a few attorneys to understand their rates and get a feel for them. \n\nTo give a bit more information, there are property exemptions usually based on state law so a lot of property is exempt and does not count toward the value of your estate. You must exceed these exemptions before the Trustee values your property.",

            "comment": "It may help to tell folks what state you're in as that state may have different laws regarding that.\n\nUsually, in bankruptcy you'll start the process with a bankruptcy lawyer who will have you declare everything of value that you own and declare all your debts. They will submit this to the court. The court may ask for clarification on any of those items and also ask about any open and recently closed bank accounts as well. No one comes to your house looking for individual items. Maybe if you're trying to declare a shit ton of person, high value items.. But I'm guessing that's still really rare.  \n\nAfter a while you'll go through the court hearing and the court will ask you questions confirming your submitted information and whether it's truthful. If so and they believe you, the court will likely rule that your debts will be cleared. \n\nThis is all great... But you won't be able to get any lines of credit, credit cards, mortgages, and sometimes even rent a place... Because of your bankruptcy. It will upset your ability to build credit for a few years.",

If so, when you declare bankruptcy, the creditor can come and demand it back but the trustee won\u2019t.\n\nI also recommend not using a bankruptcy attorney. They\u2019re very expensive. Your situation sounds very simple so use a bankruptcy paralegal.\n\nWhat debts do you have? What\u2019s your income? Is it the reduction of income that caused this? Maybe there is a way out other than bankruptcy.",

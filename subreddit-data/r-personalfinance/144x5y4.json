    "postText": "For anyone savvy on this.. I recently bought a car and had to finance some through Toyota Financial Services. Somehow my first and middle name got smooshed together (e.g. Edgarallen Poe) once my account populated online. I requested a correction, they reviewed and told me it was on the signed docs (which I reviewed and is false) so likely the dealer did something wrong electronically.   \nThey say to correct things I have to provide a photocopy of my social security card on their \"secure\" site. I find this a bit unnerving and want to know if I should fight them to verify my name or SSN/Name by other means? I already provided my driver license but they turned that down. What are your thoughts?  \nTIA",

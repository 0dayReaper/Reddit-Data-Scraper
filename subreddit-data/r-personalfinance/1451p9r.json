Should I pay in full one of my cards (if so, should I pay the oldest CC line?) or split the $2k &amp; make a payment of $500 on each? Ps. I am am idiot and the APR is about 29% on 4 of the CC lines.",

Then start applying the money you were paying on that card to another card until that one is paid off.  I\u2019d probably pay minimum payments on the other 2 cards (as opposed to paying more than minimum). The concept is to focus on paying off 1 card at a time, while staying current with your other cards. Then when the 2nd card is paid off, do the same thing to the 3rd card.  You should also stop using your cards until you have a zero balance and can pay them off in full every month.   I\u2019d also start shopping around for a good card with a cash back offer.  (Interest rate is only important if you plan on carrying a balance).\n\nAlso, I personally find it so much easier to have 1 credit card.  I know people chase points but I don\u2019t have time or patience for that.  One card, use it but only charge what you can pay off at the end of the billing cycle.   I like Capital One.",

So if you qualify for $2-5k balance transfer card then you could transfer one or two cards into such card and aggressively pay the other remaining cards. \n\nI don't think it helps to pay off the oldest, you just don't want to close the oldest card or have it closed on you (unless you have another card fairly close to it age wise, age of credit affects your score)",

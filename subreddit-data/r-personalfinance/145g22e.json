    "postText": "Today I received a tax return from Matrix Trust Company. It\u2019s Form 5498 and it shows my rollover contributions and FMV of account. What is this? Should I be concerned about this document? \n\nIt says this information on Form 5488 is submitted to the IRS by the trustee or issuer of your individual retirement (IRA) to report contributions.\n\n\nRoller contributions: $436.36\n\nFMV of account: $381.37",

That do make sense too. I was a contractor and opened up a 401k. Contract ended in 4 months so instead of them sending me a check they send it to some company idk about. Shouldn\u2019t that be illegal? It\u2019s a good thing I check my mail",

Maybe the letter got lost in the mail, who knows. I would just let it be a life lesson to stay on top of these things and not rely on the employers to do what's best for you. In reality no harm was done to you, your money is just being held by another custodian.",

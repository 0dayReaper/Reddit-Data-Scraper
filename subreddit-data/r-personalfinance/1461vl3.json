    "postText": "Currently I have 11k in CC debt and 3k in auto loans. At 29% APR for my CCs I think it would be smart to take out a loan to pay it all off.\n\nAccording to Credit KARMA I have great approval rates for a loan for 15k at 9%APR. My credit is around 740 and currently employed. \n\nSo my question is if it's a good idea to take out a personal loan? I know this community encourages people to consider consolidating your debt with a 0 APR CC first before taking out a loan.",

            "comment": "I think the main reason most people suggest a 0 APR CC vs a 9% Loan is because 0 is less than 9.  \n\nBut seriously, check out the 0% APR Cards.   Find out how much the balance transfer is (if you can use it on credit cards and loans).   And how long the 0% APR last (usually like 12 or 18 months) to make sure you can afford paying everything off before the 0APR expires.",

The catch was you had to transfer the balance within the 60 days. It also doesn\u2019t have any apr on purchase within the 24 months. No rewards with it, but not important to me right now. I has around a 720 credit score and was approved for $6500 in minutes. \n   \nMy previous cards I\u2019d had the balance on (Amex) doubled in credit line. Setting the transfer up took minutes to initiate and like 2 weeks to go through. Huge weight off my shoulders!",

I just plunked 15k on a credit card to use for starting a business, but it's not in the budget to pay it off in 12 months.

I had about $52,000.00 debt across 4 cards, it was keeping me up at night. Any payments I made just created space that I would immediately use and max out the card again. I used funds from our HELOC, back when interest rates were low, to pay it off.\n\nI canceled all of the cards except one, the one without an annual fee and I called them and reduced my credit limit to $500.00. Then I spent 5 years learning how to use credit wisely, then I graduated to making credit work for me. I now have an Airline Rewards card, tons of points &amp; perks, a very high credit limit, a credit score in the mid 800\u2019s and I have not paid a single penny of interest in a decade.\n\nYou can do it too, but you have to be disciplined. Credit cards make it easy to buy, but you have to evaluate the long term ramifications of every purchase until you condition yourself not to spend that way.",

My credit is around 740 and currently employed.\n\n&gt;So my question is if it's a good idea to take out a personal loan? I know this community encourages people to consider consolidating your debt with a 0 APR CC first before taking out a loan.\n\nThe secret trick is to put your credit cards the fuck away once you pay them off, whether it's by 9% personal loan or 0% credit card introductory balance transfer. \n\nWhat lots of people do is they rack up $7-10k in CC debt, decide they're gonna be responsible and consolidate, then as soon as those credit cards are paid off, they go right back to charging on them and within 12 months they've got a $10,000 loan at 9% and $10,000 more dollars on cards at 29% and they're fucked because now no one will loan them money. \n\nThen they stop paying on time, and then their score gets fucked, and then for the next seven years their life sucks. Then you grow up at 35 and you're finally out of debt but you have no savings, your car sucks, and you don't own a house. \n\nSo yeah, consolidate by the lowest APR you can get and then pay it off. Don't fucking charge another dime on a credit card until you're debt free. Good luck, buddy :)",

This is exactly the situation I\u2019m in and I\u2019m considering the same thing. In my case I have about $15k of cc debt over several cards that range from 17 to 29 percent (in my case my autos are both paid off), same credit score +\\-740, and I\u2019ve pondered the exact same question: why wouldn\u2019t I dump all of that into one monthly payment at a significantly lower interest rate? The only reason I haven\u2019t done it yet is my inexperience and the nagging feeling that there must be some hidden catch that will wind up biting me in the ass. \nI see some comments expressing surprise at having cc debt like this. To me, this is very familiar territory and I wonder if people don\u2019t realize what life is like in a family these days. I\u2019m very responsible with money, but life happens. Kid needs eardrum surgery? We have great insurance but BAM there\u2019s about $2k for the deductible I didn\u2019t have just sitting around waiting to be spent. That went on a cc. New set of tires for my car (because I pushed through five years of tread life on the originals), BAM $800. Credit card. Groceries for three people is easily $200 a week. And so on and so forth. Sometimes relying on a cc, particularly between paychecks, is unavoidable.\nLike you, it makes a lot of sense to me, purely on logistics, to set up an automatic twice monthly payment on a single 9% loan rather than eight separate monthly payments at 17-29% each. I just wonder if the idea is \u201ctoo good to be true.\u201d\nSo I feel you, man.",

Car broke down, I wanted to reward myself, I got sick, etc. So what would you do if you didn\u2019t have a credit card?  I tell people who want financial advice about poor decisions and poor people decisions. Poor people look at a credit limit and see that as money in the bank instead of a liability that needs to be paid back with interest. They blame the banks for charging them high interest. They expect someone to give them thousands of dollars for free. \n\nThe only real solution is spend less money and/or make more money. Swapping one debt for another is putting a bandaid of the real problem. So if you can pay it off relatively soon then get the loan and stop charging stuff to the card otherwise you will be back here asking what to do when you have thousands on a personal loan and credit card.",

I was very creditworthy at the time, and now my credit hovers around 800. It was one of the best decisions I\u2019d ever made.\n\nThe key, as others have said, is to have a hard look at your habits and stop CC use if you can\u2019t do it responsibly.",

            "comment": "How many cards do you have? The credit hit for opening one card is pretty low. Over time, it can help bring your score up because of lower utilization. \n\nOne thing to consider too is payment flexibility with a 0% card. Plan to pay it off aggressively within the time frame. If you have something come up, you can just pay the minimum for a month or two. With a personal loan, youre locked into that payment every month. \n\nMake a budget so you don\u2019t rack up the CC debt again! 3k in auto loans is very low, and if you got the loan before this year, your rate is also probably very good compared to what they are now.",

Also, if the car loan rate isn't outrageous - or if you'll have it paid off soon, it might be better to keep it separate.  This will mean higher combined payments in the short-run, but it will likely be worth the sacrifice as part of starting this debt management adventure by being more aggressive.",

Yes, 9% is better than 29%, and I wasn\u2019t comfortable opening up more cards when I did it. \n\nYou have to look at BOTH income and expenses as part of this equation. The interest is an expense, so whatever mechanism you have to cut is a good thing, and CC balance transfer offers are going to be cheaper than a loan. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re cutting elsewhere in your budget to avoid getting in this mess again, but there\u2019s only so much a person can cut. So look at income too. It might be a side hustle, working more OT, for some, but for others it could be an entire career change. Not saying it\u2019s easy, but the payoff (literally and figuratively) is worth it.",

            "comment": "Here's the order of operations I'd probably take for paying minimal interest and coming out with a better credit profile and more flexibility.\n\n1. Call up your current CC company and ask about lowering your APR. Hopefully this won't matter as you'll balance transfer everything from here. \n\n2. Apply for a few 0% BT credit cards. You typically pay a 3-5% BT fee.\n\nWith a 740 credit score a card with a 15-21 month no interest period should be common. \n\nWF has 2-3 decent options. There are olenty more to choose from.\n\n3. They're less common but 0% BT cards exist. The no interest period tends to be shorter.\n\n4. If the BT CCs limits are more than your needs STOP here. If not, now you'll apply for a personal loan and out the remainder on here. \n\nBe somewhat mindful of hard pulls as the more apps the more you'll be dinged (typically falls off in about a year).\n\n5. I'd look into Citi Flex Loans, AMEX personal loans 1st if you have a relationship already or want one with those providers. \n\nThen I'd consider some of there newer fintechs like SoFi for their broader financial ecosystem, namely checking.\n\n6. If any debt is left move or keep (step 1) on the credit card with lowest APR.\n\n7. Setup all your automatic minimum payments immediately.\n\nYou could jump start your payments by opening a new checking account that has a bonus. Now you've isolated that part of your cash flow. Just setup a direct deposit of at least the minimum monthly payment.\n\nYou should end up paying way less in interest and have a higher credit limit which will improve your utilization ratio and ultimately credit score.\n\nIf you get a personal loan it may help with your credit mix. Don't do this at in lieu of paying no interest. \n\nAlso, closing out an auto loan may impact your credit mix in the opposite of opening a PL. \n\nCheers to saving some $ money.",

The loan is just under 9%, it would have been 12% but I paid off 11k in cc debt directly through the loan so they gave me a better deal. I took out an extra 6k. The loan will cost me 1k/year in fees for five years which I felt was worth it, and it\u2019s $350ish/month where I was paying $100 minimums on five cards previously and getting nowhere. My monthly payments went down and I\u2019m not paying crazy cc percentages. Happy with it for sure.",

            "comment": "Have you heard of, or considered, the rolling payoff method of getting rid of credit card debt? Rather than pay the same amount on each card, pay the minimum required on all but one card,and then throw all the rest at the last one. If one has higher interest than the others, it\u2019s the wisest way to start. \n\nBut it\u2019s not terrible to choose the one with the lowest balance, so that it goes away quicker. \n\nDo NOT use the cards. Make a budget that allows you to pay all necessary things in clouding those minimum payments, and then whatever is left goes on that card. So, as an example, let\u2019s say that after rent, phone, food and transportation, you have $800 available. Take $100 for your emergency fund, and then pay the minimums on four cards, which for arguments sake is a total of $275. You then have $425 to throw at the chosen card. Do that monthly. Once that card is paid off, do the same with the next one, but you\u2019ll have a little more to pay on it monthly, because now you\u2019re paying minimums on three, and all the rest on the fourth. \n\nIf you get raises or bonuses as you\u2019re doing this, throw ALL of that at the chosen card, too.",

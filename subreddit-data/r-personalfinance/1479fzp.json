    "postText": "Hello everyone! I hope you are doing well. I am looking for some advice regarding getting back on the right track.\n\n  \nHere's some background: I am a married high-school English teacher in the Deep South with both a BA and an MA in English. My teaching job pays about 56k before taxes and my wife was making about 27k before taxes. In February, my whole life changed when my wife gave birth to premature twins. To say I was unprepared would be an accurate statement. As my kids were in the NICU for an entire month, it ate through our savings almost immediately. After they were born, we quickly realize that childcare would eat up the entirety of my wife's paycheck and then some (especially due to there being two children), so we came to the conclusion that she would need to stay home. This brought us down to a single income.\n\n  \nI realized that the 56k that I am making isn't going to cut it, as according to my very amateur budget spreadsheet, we would be about $800-900 short each month after bills (mortgage, car payment, debt, etc.). We have one car payment, a debt consolidation through InCharge, and a bank loan from before we got married that wouldn't agree to the InCharge agreement. There's not much we can cut. I decided that for the time being, I would work for my local grocery store stocking shelves for $15 an hour during my summer vacation, but it's only going to get us so far, as I go back to school in August.   \n\n\nWhen the kids were born, I was able to work something out with my mortgage company to drop my mortgage payment down substantially for a few months, but this ends soon. When it does end, I am going to be in some trouble. I'm open to the idea of changing occupations, but I now have a time crunch. I've sent out applications, but it seems like the competition is fierce due to teachers leaving the profession for fields like EdTech and I can't afford to change to a field that would result in a pay cut, as it would be counterintuitive to my new situation. I've mainly applied to remote jobs as due to the help our family gives us caring for the kids, it would be very difficult to do a dramatic move. I live in a tourist town, so we don't have a lot of big corporations or industry.\n\n  \nSo, I'm not looking for pity; I am looking for advice or ideas so that I can help my family. I am open to career advice, financial advice, or anything really. I am just sort of lost and could use some guidance. I am unsure of my options.",

            "comment": "First, congrats on the babies! I hope everyone is healthy and well. I\u2019m sure this stress isn\u2019t helping but you got this. \n\nYou mentioned that you live in a tourist town, so I\u2019m sure there are several seasonal jobs available (and some pay really well, depending on the season). Summer work has been very lucrative in the past for me, so this is my immediate go to. Of course this does not apply if you live in a ski town, but I am assuming your tourist levels go quite high in the summer. Here is my advice: \n\n1) Get a second job with a company in the tourism service industry - This is great for flexibility, can be part or full-time (especially since they do not usually stick to a 7-3 schedule like your teaching job might). Be a server, barkeeper, hotel staff, shopkeeper for those tourist shops, bookseller, food truck hand, etc. Just note that this is relatively tiring and depending on the job, may not pay TOO well. However, it definitely helps keep the lights on. \n\n2) Offer to lead tourist activities yourself - Tours are super lucrative. You can rent equipment and costumes for cheap and lead groups on tourist activities. Kayaking tours, fishing tours, ghost tours, walking tours around the city, cycling tours, food tours, winery tours, hiking tours, photography tours\u2026 you name it and there\u2019s a tour out there. Check licensing, business, and safety requirements before you do this, or make it clear that it is not an official city activity. Price it lower than other authorised touring companies. \n\n3) Offer up your own work - If you have contacts that own seasonal business, offer up your own work. If they own Airbnbs in the area, offer up your help to clean, disinfect, and manage them. People are returning to their summer homes now and will need help with landscaping, handyman work, and moving. I\u2019m sure loads of fishing charters need help dealing with the summer demand. Post on social media and quick-job sites like Thumbtack and Craigslist. Reach out to the people you know in real life! Do the leg work, and this could be very lucrative. For example, I earned $3000 per month walking dogs and building my own client base over the summer, and I only did that one year when the cost of living crisis meant it was float or go hungry. I walked for about 5 hours a day when I did it, but mostly staggered throughout the day so I could still work my other job. The business kept going and turned into a part-time job throughout the year because I loved it so much, even when I didn\u2019t need the money.\n\n4) Enter the gig economy - Sign up to Doordash, grub hub, instacart, secret shopper, shift wise, ANYTHING you can pick up and do whenever you have some free time. I did Doordash a TON and really enjoyed it. A couple hours a day after work meant I needed to commute in my car anyway, and I could make some money while decompressing from my day in my car. \n\nThis may be touchy depending on you and your family, and I hope you don\u2019t need to do this if it is uncomfortable, but it may be worth encouraging your wife to also pick up some quick gig work (like doordashing for a couple hours) when you can be with your babies. You can bond and care for them, and she can also get some time away from the kids while helping with the situation!",

A couple teachers at my son's center are able to work there and bring their kids for care and a friend did that with her son after becoming a single mom. I know it's not possible at all childcare places and it may be tough since you have two kids vs one, but wanted to throw it out there as an idea to maybe look into.",

I planned to take off one year, but when she was 1, I started working at a learning center as a tutor, with a schedule opposite my husband.  Then when she was 2, we had twins.  There was no way we could afford three kids under 3 in daycare, so I continued the learning center job. I also picked up private tutoring students.  When the twins started kindergarten, I went back to substitute teaching and returned to full-time teaching a few years later.  I made $300-$500 per month, sometimes more, and it helped with groceries. \n\nGood luck! I know it\u2019s overwhelming.  You will survive and thrive.",

Cast your net wide - first of all, brush up on your LinkedIn profile. if you have FB, post there that you are looking for new opportunities and let your network help you out, also ask people to add you on LinkedIn. When changing fields, your network is very important. People will give you advice - a lot of it will not be helpful, but some will be; ask people in your extended network to introduce you to potential employers, do informational interviews. Consider switching to an industry with growth potential, you have two young children and again, 56k will not really cut it, so take a look at banking and other such industries. Freelance is also an option. Take a look at Upwork and other similar places to supplement income by writing for websites. The field is now changing thanks to AI, but you can still get freelance gigs. \n\nIf you have a university in your area, university admin is a pathway which can be open to you and provide you training in EdTech. It does not pay amazing, but is full of opportunities for training and networking. \n\nGood luck!",

In retrospect, I wish I just changed fields, but this worked out fine for me with time. It was just exhausting. Getting into leadership was my path, and as my skillset and experience grew, so did my opportunities.  I'm also still doing my freelance gigs... Looking to wind down on that a bit in the next few years.\n\nIf you know other teachers who left the profession, you should reach out to them and do informational interviews. The more people you talk to about your job search, the higher the chances that you will get connected to someone who can give you a leg up. Also, Youtube is a GREAT source of information on job searches and career change. Also try the careeradvice subreddit.\n\nDespair is your biggest enemy. Chin up! You can do this!",

My fear with picking up freelance jobs is that I will lose time with my family and burn myself out. I can't really take more responsibility at work, as teachers don't get paid for any extra activities. So, I have come to the conclusion that I have to change fields for my family's sake. But, that's been the challenge. I've asked over at the CareerGuidance subreddit with mixed results. Their answers were either change fields and start an entry level position (which would require a paycut that my family cannot afford) or negative comments like \"Those who can't do, teach\" and basically saying that I educated myself into a difficult corner. Which, I definitely did. Two degrees in English puts me in a tight spot. But there's not much I can do about that with the situation that I am in.\n\nI'm going to continue applying to other fields and hope there's at least one person who gives me a shot that puts me in a stable financial position.\n\nThank you so much for the reassurance.

Can you help seniors with college admissions essays/test prep/ tutoring? This may be a conflict of interest.\n2. Since you have a MA, can you get adjunct work at a local community college? Online courses would be ideal. You may also be able to get hours in a tutoring/writing center. \n3. You\u2019re in a tourist area. Is there a significant immigrant population? Can you do ESL?",

I was just surprised by that part of your story that you only realized after they were already here that they would need childcare and someone would have to provide it. \n\nOne way people make two incomes work without paying for childcare is shift work on opposite shifts. If your wife could get a night/weekend job while you do the childcare on weekends, that would probably help close the gap until you\u2019re out of debt. And then once they\u2019re in school she would have more time to work days. That only works if you can pull your weight as a caregiver though!",

We did sort of underestimate the cost of childcare, and when we originally planned for the pregnancy, we didn\u2019t foresee twins. So, the childcare cost essentially doubled. \n\nAnother poster suggested having my wife do nights and weekends, that is definitely something we are considering when we have do an in-depth analysis together, which we are doing in a couple days. \n\nThanks!",

You might want to contact the English Department and see if they need someone to teach Freshman English night classes. As an Adjunct (I think modern terminology is \"contingent faculty\") you'll be paid on a per class basis, with no benefits, but your regular teaching job should cover those.\n\nYour MA will qualify you to teach CV courses at the Freshman level, and in most rural, small towns there is always a dearth of residents with graduate degrees to cover the odd section or fill in for a regular faculty member that is gone for a semester.",

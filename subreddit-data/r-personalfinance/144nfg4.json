    "postText": "no more ebt with no notice??\n\nmy partner and i started getting ebt payments a few months ago. recently with the govt no longer wanting to  recognize covid as a pandemic they docked the ebt amounts in maryland. went from $500 to $98. however today my partner says on the app at projected payments it says $0 and under projected payment date it says n/a. the dept is closed now that's it's evening time so i can't call to ask and i'm livid. not to mention every time in the past when i've tried calling, i stay on hold for about 2 hours and then it hangs up on me. we have had absolutely no changes to income level or jobs or anything that would cause a change. what is going on?? what do i do???",

Could just be something as simple as missing periodic paperwork that had to be submitted.",

In addition to it negatively impacting your debt to available credit ratio, length of accounts is also a significant factor. \n\nWhat you suggested in terms of charging a small amount each month and then paying it off will help, not hurt your rating. Regular monthly bills are a good way to automate this.",

I have a card I no longer use because of subpar rewards but I've had it open for 20 years so not going to close it, last charge I made was a coffee in December.",

It's a lot of work to go through the trouble of maintaining the card with small purchases (assuming it's a card that would get cancelled for inactivity), and the more separate cards you have to pay off each month, the more likely you will miss a payment and get your score dinged for that, which would be counterproductive. \n\nIf you're going to buy a house or car in the next few months, then just keep the card open. Short of that, keep asking for the credit limit to be raised on the cards you do use, and close the ones you don't. Simplify.",

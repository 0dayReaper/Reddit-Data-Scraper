    "postText": "It's summer for me, a high schooler, right now so I have had a lot of time on my hands which has caused a lot of thinking. I have a full time job, of which I plan to continue to work into the school year with the same hours, but I still have free time, and to be completely honest, this job just isnt cutting it when I feel like there's money making opportunities on the tip of my tongue... I just don't know what they are. The issue im having, because Im sure you're wondering why I wouldnt just get a higher paying job, is I love my job. I love everything about my job, and most importantly I am able to bike there, and considering it is my only mode of independent transportation, that is an obvious pro. So, as a teenager that works a full time job and has no car, is there any way I could have a second source of income at home or close by my home?\n[TLDR: Need ideas for a second source of income, am a teenager with a full time job and only a bike]",

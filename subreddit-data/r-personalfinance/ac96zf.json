    "postText": "Back in July we were wrapping up our yearly road trip to Illinois. We purchased gas around 8 or 9am right before we started the 12 hour trip to Texas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo hours into the trip my wife gets a notification on her phone from Bank of America alerting her to fruadulent charges being made. We only have one debit cad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile we were starting our driving home, someone in Austin, Tx purchased around $500 in merch at Home Depot, drove towards Houston, Tx attempting twice to use our card at the ATM, which did not work because they didnt have the pin. They made their $200-ish last transaction at TJ Maxx North of Houston before were alerted and had the card shut off. (Austin to Houston is about a 3 hour car ride)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife immedately makes a claim. 10 days later, we get the money credited back while they continue the investigation which seems pretty open and shut to me... They also say it may be another 45 days before they finish their investigation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOctober 5, they send a letter stating that they have completed their investigation: \"Our records show the transaction activity in question was authorized for and posted to your account.\" The letter states they'll be taking the $740 back on October 22.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWife calls and has them reopen the case or escalate it. We're told it could be another 45 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDecember 22. We call Bank of America again. This agent has no record of anything being escalated. Says he will escalate it and we should hear from someone in the next few business days. Nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJan 3. Wife calls them again. This agent states that while an escalation sends an email to their investigators notifying that we are still asking about they case, they are under no obligation to complete it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter reading a bit into the law surrounding this, we have realized we can request the documentation they used to close the investigation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat else can we do? Do we need a lawyer? If they had to reimburse us for the first 45 days of the investigation, why do they not have to temporarily reimburse us as they continue to investigate \"for as long as they need\" with no date set for resolution on our end?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is blatantly obvious that someone skimmed the card at some point and had a dummy one made. Are they able to continue to withhold our $750 indefinitely and just keep saying. \"Nope! Looks good!\" until we tire out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur kiddos missed out on a lot of Christmas gifts because of this and now bills are starting to get a bit tight. We really need this money back. Thanks yall!\n\n**Update:** Started posting on social media before I start filing complaints. 20 minutes later Bank of America contacted me on Twitter. Will update later. Thanks for everyone's advice.\n\n**Update 2: 3 hours later...** I continued to post on social media, reaching out to local news stations on Twitter that have community protection or investigative segments and linking to this post. Bank of America has now reached out in one of these posts, referencing my wifes name. Fingers crossed.  [http://imgur.com/gallery/i4gWtC0](http://imgur.com/gallery/i4gWtC0)\n\n**Update 3:** Wife got home 30 min after my last update. A rep with BoA actually called her asking what was going on. The rep said she would need to call the fraud department and get them all on the line together. We are at our kids practice so opted for them to call us when they have someone on the line who can help us. Will update later.\n\n**Update 4:** Just got off the phone with someone in the fraud department at Bank of America. I recorded the whole convo and will be uploading it to YouTube. She says the call on Oct 22 did in fact reopen the case. (even though the rep on Dec 22 said otherwise and the rep earlier today said they have no timeline to adhere to and can take as long as they want)\n\nThey now have 60 business days from Oct 22 to finish the claim once again.\n\nShe says one of the reasons that the claim was denied was because the didnt attempt to drain her account. (They hit up two ATMs and failed to use the pin to drain the account, so they don't even have the correct info to base their findings off)\n\nI requested documentation about the claim as law allows and she says I should get that in 10 business days. They now have until Jan 18 to notify us of their findings. I'm going to continue with filing reports and posting on social media.\n\nI'll update in a few weeks I guess.\n\n**Update 5: 10 hours later,** they have blocked me on Facebook for sharing my problems on their page. I also filed a complaint with the CFPB .\n\n**Update 6:** 24 hours since this post and David, a Bank of America employee in the \"Regulatory Complaints Department\" left my wife a voice mail  in regards to a complaint sent to them by the CFPB. They close at 4pm EST. (They're closed by the time we got the voice mail since she is at work). Will update Monday.\n\n**Update 7:** Wife woke up this morning and the money has been returned to our account. Time to turn and burn!\n\nThank you everyone for your advice. We learned a lot from this.\n\n**Update 8: We got confirmation that the fraud claim is now closed and the money that was returned is permanent. Waiting on an actual paper letter to come in the mail before we turn and run. Thanks everyone!

She says the call on Oct 22 did in fact reopen the case. (even though the rep on Dec 22 said otherwise and the rep earlier today said they have no timeline to adhere to and can take as long as they want) \n\nThey now have 60 business days from Oct 22 to finish the claim once again. \n\nShe says one of the reasons that the claim was denied was because the didnt attempt to drain her account. (They hit up two ATMs and failed to use the pin to drain the account, so they don't even have the correct info to base their findings off) \n\nI requested documentation about the claim as law allows and she says I should get that in 10 business days. They now have until Jan 18 to notify us of their findings. I'm going to continue with filing reports and posting on social media.\n\nI'll update in a few weeks I guess.",

A rep with BoA actually called her asking what was going on. The rep said she would need to call the fraud department and get them all on the line together but it might take 40 min to reach someone. We are at our kids practice so opted for them to call us when they have someone on the lone who can help us. Will update later.",

Unfortunately, a fraudster emptied her bank account over New Years Eve, leaving her without money to pay the rent this month. She has been fighting with Bank of America for the past two days to quickly get her money reimbursed.\n\nu/Econ0mist gives good advice too, if this drags on for much longer. Go to the federal regulator. My friend had a dispute with B of A over a loan balance. They erroneously claimed he owed them $4,000+ but had no documentation. He asked for proof but they said they didn't have it. They offered to send him something for him to sign saying he was responsible for the debt, but of course he was not about to do that. This put him into limbo, where they wouldn't collect on it, nor would they sue him. Then they put it on his credit report as a write-off, plunging his score into the 400s and causing both Chase and American Express to cancel all of his credit cards. (Ironically, B of A would not take any negative action against him on his B of A credit cards, presumably because -- again -- they knew they had no right.) For over nine months he called them to have it corrected, but they refused to investigate any further. The three credit bureaus were useless too, as they would \"investigate\" by checking with Bank of America, who would confirm they did write off a debt. After having expensive lawyers write letters and getting no response, my friend sent a quick note to the regulator. Within one week, he received a phone call from the Bank of America Office of the President in Charlotte, saying they would remove the debt and correct his credit report.\n\ntl;dr: Much credit to the government for intervening in my friend's case; they acted swiftly to keep Bank of America honest.",

They actually fixed the problem, said we didn't owe anything ( no shit, probate ended 7 years ago, they legally can't collect anything) and sent us a letter saying it was all fixed",

I remember back in around 2007-2008 when I had forgot to pay my credit card, they called me and asked if everything was okay and were like you've never been late on a payment before.  I was like oh shoot, it slipped my mind.  The rep said I see you have money in your account to pay the bill, I could pay the bill from your account and reverse the late fee for you if you would like.  I said great thanks!  \n\nFast forward 10 years, I have 2 credit cards with them (13 year and 11 year age), I was out of the country and late by a couple days on one card, the other had a 0 balance (and an 6.5% interest rate).  I come home from vacation to a letter saying my card with 0 balance has been closed and my other credit limit decreased substantially.  I call credit reps, they do nothing and transfer me to a credit analyst who says I can try to reopen the account for you then tell me the account terms are no longer available.  Well no shit Sherlock, I had a ridiculously low interest rate and that is why I am furious.  Not to mention decreasing my credit age and utilization tanked my score by about 50 points.\n\nTalked to a manager, he said it was a business decision they made and it cannot be reversed because I have been late on 6 payments (by no more than a week, so not \"late\" according to credit bureaus).  I kindly let him know that between my two cards I have nearly 300 months of history and it is obviously not indicative of a trend.  I filed a BBB complaint, and ended up talking to someone in compliance who called me and left a voicemail saying the same thing that it was a business decision and wouldn't return my calls when I called him back.  So I made a business decision of my own, and took my business elsewhere and will never again do business with BofA or Merrill Lynch.  Their loss!",

At the same time, it's absolutely true there is a psychological angle to using credit cards, and the banks do their best to exploit that. More than 1 in 4 people with super-prime credit and the vast majority of everyone else carry balances on their credit card, so it obviously works, and it's not just idiots who fall into the trap.\n\nAs far as the risks of debit cards, anyone following DR's system will quickly build 3-6 months of expenses in savings and keep it there permanently. Such a person will not be affected much if $2000 was stolen out of their checking account and it took a year to get the money back. None of their bills would go unpaid, and their kids would not go without toys at Christmas. Considering that having your debit card compromised to that degree is an unlikely event anyway, and federal law limits your liability, it's an acceptable risk to self-insure against. ",

If I use a CC they could just as easily say I made the purchase and owe the balance / report it as delinquent, and ding my credit if I don't pay it.\n\nI see the risk of not having my funds available because the bank took them, but honestly I only see this as a risk of having (1) account, or your debit card tied to an account where you have any significant amount of money. \n\nNever do your savings and checking with the same bank seems like solid advice.",

The bank won't be arsed to find the root of the fraud, and would be inclined to think you caused it. That isn't to say that credit card companies don't think you are the source of the fraud, but it is inherently their money involved until you pay the balance, so they should be motivated more to figure out what happened to the purchase.   \n\nEven if they ding your credit, you have a way to fight this and appeal the fraudulent case and therefore get the ding removed from your report with less skin off your back (unless you're actively looking into credit purchases like a house/car). It's harder to fight something when you have no money to do so, if the money was stolen from your bank account.",

I went to the transaction, got as much info from the transaction as possible, found the store location and phone number. I called the store, let them know about the fraud, told them the date, time, and amount. I told them I was going to contact my bank as well. When I contacted the bank I had the store number, address, and phone number, as well as the managers name. They wanted to know how I got all the information, they were suspicious of my information. I told them that the alert got me suspicious so I checked my acct and got all the store info from the transaction data on the bank app itself. I was refunded my $300+ within 5 business days, and I was given a call back letting me know they caught the woman on camera at the store using my card. \n\nMy advice is to get all the information from those transactions, try to talk to the owners of the atms that were used in an attempt to clean you out, and do some snooping of your own. Then give the info to the bank and let them know that it shouldn\u2019t be left up to you to find this info out. ",

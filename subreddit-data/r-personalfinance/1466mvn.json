I'm lucky enough that my parents will be mostly paying for school, but I'm feeling lost on what to do with my personal money. Where should I look to start investing/easy beginnings to make sure my money doesn't just stay stagnant?",

This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Broad market ETFs for the win.",

Spend some to better educate yourself.  College is about exploration, about learning who you are and what drives you.  What motivates you, what excites you.  Spend some of the cash on yourself, to help refine what you may want to do after college.  \n\n  \nThe best investment isn't always an ETF or stock.  It's sometimes could be in yourself.",

You are the best investment, getting a good degree, graduating on time, and getting a good job is most important.  You will have decades to invest $s, use this cash to invest in yourself.",

    "postText": "I called in to ask what internet speeds were available in my area. He tried to sell me on cable, which I declined. He asked for my social and my date of birth. I asked him why he needed this and he explained it was to make sure I didn\u2019t have any past due balances with AT&amp;T. I then double checked and asked him if it would hit my credit and he chuckled and said \u201cno no sir nothing like that\u201d. \n\nFast forward an hour, I have an email stating my installation for phone, cable, and internet is scheduled(???) and then a few minutes later an email from credit karma saying I had a hard inquiry. \n\nCalled in and spoke to 3 different departments, finally to a woman to tell me she couldn\u2019t remove it because calling in to inquire about service was all the consent they needed. \n\nThis clearly doesn\u2019t seem legal, and wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and what I should do next. \n\nTL;DR - spoke to ATT, they asked for social, I made sure it wouldn\u2019t hit my credit, I was told it wouldn\u2019t, and then it did. What next?  \n\nEDIT 4: Filed a complaint with my attorney general. \n\nEDIT 3: Filed a complaint with the CFPB. All the support and advice here has been a true blessing and I thank each and every one of you for taking the time to comment with good advice and/or possible solutions. \n\nEDIT 2: I called back in, and actually had a great conversation with someone who was super understanding and willing to help. She got me to the fraud department. I spoke with Dorothy. She told me that it **did not matter** that I asked my credit not to be ran. That when someone calls in to inquire about service, they are consenting to a credit check. Doesn't matter if I didn't give my social, they would have used my DOB or DL #. She told me that I could not speak to a supervisor as this was standard practice, and she wouldn't escalate it. She also said some calls are recorded and some weren't, and she did not help me in finding the call from my first conversation. I then asked her for a copy of this call and her response was \"I don't know if it's being recorded so I can't help you\". She had nothing to say about the rep lying to me, and she said their credit disclaimer statement didn't sound anything like a credit disclaimer statement and I probably didn't even know it was read to me. Unbelievable. This is their FRAUD department. Jesus Christ. \n\nEDIT: I see a lot of folks saying \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal, couple points will fall off in no time\u201d. I just got an email from credit karma that a hard inquiry from 2 years ago just fell off my report, and that left me with one hard hit which was back in January. I\u2019ve been working very hard on rebuilding my credit, checking quite frequently and really boosting my score. One or two points may not be a big deal to some but after working so hard to improve my score, having it lowered without my authorization or consent is devastating. \n\n",

My wife worked there years ago and her boss would have all the associates add every \"extra\" feature to people's plans so they would all get commissions and the store would hit their sales numbers.  He would then have the same associates call the 800 number and, *by claiming to be the customer and providing the customer's SSN and address to verify their identity as the customer*, would remove the extras they added before they appeared on the customer's first bill.\n\nThey would add extra features customers didn't want, add them anyways to make commission, and then impersonate the customer to cancel those items before the actual customer found out.",

They refused to give me the introductory price that\u2019s advertised on their website because \u201cthat\u2019s for new customers only.\u201d I was a Comcast customer for *less than a day* so I wasn\u2019t a new customer anymore, and my bill went down five dollars. You know they tried \u201cit\u2019s only $5 more to keep the cable though!\u201d shit too. I told them to shove their cable and once there\u2019s another high speed internet company in my area they can shove that too. I\u2019m sure the rep was rubbing their nipples the whole fucking time.

Sounded good to me, so I put in my credit card info and set up a installation date. Couple hours later I get an email to call their \"Internet Order Specialist\" (or some shit) team to confirm everything. I call them up and the guy sets me up with a package that is nothing like what I ordered, wrong internet speed, no HBO, wrong price, etc. I tell him so. He tells me they dont have the package I was offered online. I was extremely confused since I was calling to confirm something I had already given payment information for. Not to mention I ordered online and was talking to the people who handle online orders. He tells me he cant find the order and if I want the package I selected, I would need to call into an actual agent to get it... so I begrudgingly do and get it straightened out since I have no other choice.\n\nFast forward a month and a half and my first bill has a $60 installation fee after being told over the phone multiple times it was free, just like the package I wanted was advertised. Call in to complain about this and was told by 2 different people that I agreed to an installation fee. I told them to shove it and pull the recording of me talking with the agent who set up my account and hear how many times \"installation is free\" was mentioned. They tell me they will pull the tapes and a manager would get back to me within a week. Nobody calls. So I call them back, speak to yet another person who claims \"the investigation found the charge was legit\". At this point I lose it, I am fed up and getting dicked around by these people and the agent is acting snarky with me. Ask to speak with his manager. Manager takes about 10 seconds of looking at my account before she goes \"theres a note right here that says FREE INSTALLATION written by the agent you set your account up with\". So appearently 3 different people, and an \"investigation\" all missed what is probably the only note on my account and tried to tell me the installation charge was legit. They didnt even give me anything other than the $60 off my next bill, despite being dicked around for weeks and trying to scam me. Fuck Comcast.",

Maybe call centers are different but at my store our Union rep would have had a field day if a manager ever coached us to do that. \n\nSource:I worked for Att for five years as a sales rep, you aren't any managers friend when you do the right thing every time but as long as you don't screw up with an ethics violation or attendance issue you will keep your job.

I didn't answer most of the time but they kept calling and leaving messages and had accurate information so eventually I picked up. Was told they were all set to get me a quote but they just needed the accurate square footage of my house. I kept insisting I wasn't interested and they had the wrong information. I assumed it was a friend who signed me up for something as a prank. The sales rep tried to tell me that they already had authorization from me to come give me a quote, which I would then be charged for, that was when I had enough. I realized I had an ace in the hole that would get them to leave me alone. \n\n\"You know I don't OWN a home, right?\"\n&lt;click&gt;\nNever heard from them again.",

It's called slamming and is entirely illegal. While management would obviously tell us not to do this, they would turn a blind eye when it did occur because increased sales metrics benefited everyone, especially management. It would usually take a client audit where a member of AT&amp;T corporate would dial in and listen to our center's calls to discover these illegal sales. \n\nThere are certain procedures in place to prevent it from happening, but I would advice anyone to never consent to a credit check or give out their SSN over the phone unless they are *absolutely* certain they are going to make a purchase *and* have done their homework on the product they're buying. Almost everyone lied about activation fees and they rarely fully informed customers of contract terms (such as how under a 2-year contract your price goes up after the first year and you're still locked in, most would only ever acknowledge the promo price before closing the sale). \n\nWhen I worked there, a customer with good credit would be approved for U-Verse internet with $0 down. This meant the sales agent could lock you into a contract and schedule an installation with the press of a button. They wouldn't need any credit card information. DirecTV was the same in some states, as were phone upgrades before the Next program was introduced. AT&amp;T call centers have some shady sales tactics. You're not much better off at a store, but the corporate owned stores are more ethical than the authorized retailers. Either way, an educated customer is a shady salesman's worst enemy. ",

The average cell phone bill for a family I see is between $200-500 depending on how many phones theyre paying on and what kind of plan. That's a car payment or almost a house payment. It makes sense to run credit to see if someone can even afford that. Phones are $500-1500. If we sell you 5 on a payment plan without a credit check and you stop paying in 3 months, were out $5000. It makes sense. If you don't want a credit check and can afford it, buy your phone in cash from Apple or Google or whoever and do prepaid service. It's cheaper anyways and you'll avoid that credit check.",

In truth, it was to see how many fees they could slap onto poor people with bad credit.\n\nWe were told U-Verse and everything else did a soft credit check but we could check the availability in areas before setting everything up in that system.\n\nOf course, most of my calls weren\u2019t sales calls even though that\u2019s what we were told in training (which wasn\u2019t much at all). It turns out that most of my calls were fixing problems that other bad employees caused because they wanted bonus and lied to customers about prices and how long those prices lasted. It was a nightmare. The turnaround in that company and particular site I was at was amazing. They just cranked people out of training and got butts in seats.

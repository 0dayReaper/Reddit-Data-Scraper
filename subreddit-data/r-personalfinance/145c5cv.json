I currently have the Student Discover IT card with a credit line of 1500 that I've had for almost a full year now.\n\nNow that I have a full time job, I'm wondering should I apply for a new credit card since I am no longer a studnet, extend my current cards line, or just apply for a new one and if I do should I close my current one?",

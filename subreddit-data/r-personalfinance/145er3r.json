    "postText": "I am feeling really dumb. I kept hearing about HEB's 6% rate on their savings account so I opened an account with them. I knew it came with a bunch of stipulations (eg, if you have over 2k in the account the savings rate drops, you need to move money around every 90 days or you get a $40 charge) and thought I'd be able to manage it.\n\nI didn't know they were going to be totally impossible to work with in every other way. I decided to get my money out and close it.\n\nThey use Plaid for linking accounts, but whenever I tried to link to my Alliant or Capital One account, plaid would say \"you're connected!\" And then it would redirect to the HEB site where it would say \"failed to connect.\" Called HEB, they say there's no issue on their end and I should try again later. It never works.\n\nYou can send money \"directly\" across debit accounts, but it costs $30+ for each small transfer.\n\nI was able to link the accounts manually by initiating through Alliant, the transfer said it went through, then said it didn't, and I got a $15 penalty from Alliant. Called both banks, Alliant says on their end it appears the account is frozen, HEB says it's not and I should try again.\n\nTry again, same thing. Now Alliant dropped my transfer limit to $250 and won't move it back up unless HEB gives written admittance of fault. Escalated the issue and got the same answer. Call HEB, they still say they have no issues on their end.\n\nI really have liked Alliant and they have benefits I haven't seen elsewhere (eg, no foreign transaction fees). I don't want to switch but it seems like I'll have to.\n\nI haven't seen anyone else have these issues with HEB so I guess this is a warning in addition to a plea for advice/ideas for new banks/etc.",

            "comment": "It wouldn't surprise me if Alliant blocked the transfer.\n\nHEB Debit uses Pathward (formerly known as Metabank) which is used by various prepaid cards.  Their routing number is blocked by many financial institutions.  I encountered the block recently from Affinity FCU, Ally Bank, BECU, and Service CU.  All of them told me that the routing number wasn't allowed, and none of them gave me a penalty, but perhaps Alliant's left hand doesn't know what their right hand is blocking.",

It's good to have a possible explanation, but I imagine will be very difficult to go back to Alliant with this now.\n\nWere you able to find any instition that could work with them or otherwise move the money around easier?\n\nThank you!",

The widespread blocking (you can add PNC Bank to my earlier list) is quite a problem for H-E-B Debit, especially since (if I understood the terms correctly) you have to initiate the transfer from outside to avoid the inactivity fees.\n\nOne other thing I thought of: did you activate the debit card before attempting the transfer?  If not, then H-E-B might have blocked it for that reason.",

When you do tranfers from this account its only the checking portion not the savings portion that is what eans the interest. Maybe thats the issue. In order to transfer your savings fund you have to move it to the chesking/debit side first. Hopehully that makes since and could be your problem.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, do you guys know of a credit card with high rewards multiplier for Polo Ralph Lauren? I have chase ecosystems currently but they don't seem to partner with RL ever. The other thing is, I want to buy furnitures from RL but 'home improvement' promotion do not count RL because it's mainly a clothing brand. My plan so far is using my BoA 3% on online purchase (EDIT: $2500 limit per quarter). But I'd really appreciate it if you could suggest me a higher reward option. Thank you for your time and advice. Also, if this is the wrong subreddit, please let me know where I should post it.",

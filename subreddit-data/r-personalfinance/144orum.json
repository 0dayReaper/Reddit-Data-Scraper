    "postText": "I have a balance transfer promotional offer from one of my current credit cards that I never use. I didn't bother looking at it initially as I just mentally filed it under junk mail, but took another look at it before shredding and realized that this may prove beneficial. However I've waited a long time to examine the offer and it will be expiring in a few days so I would like to move on it quickly.  \n\n\nThe credit line on this card is $2000, and the balance transfer is 0% APR until January 2024 with a 3% transfer fee. Should I use it, and if so should I use it towards: \n\nCard #1\n\nCurrent APR: 27.99% \n\nLine of credit: $2000 \n\nCurrent balance: $1313 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOR\n\nCard #2\n\nCurrent APR: 26.99%\n\nLine of credit: $8000\n\nCurrent balance: $7,738\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI acknowledge that if I use the transfer on Card #1, I can use the rest of the balance on Card #2.  \nCard #1 is usually at zero balance but due to life I had to charge it this past month and likely won't incur any charges after its paid off. But for the long run it seems like it would save me more money to pay down Card #2 and save on interest? Also yes, I will be able to pay off $333 on the balance transfer card every month in order to pay it off in time.\n\nI have incurred $60,000 in debt in the last 2 years. I'm in my early 30s, have always supported myself, and have only been this deep in debt before when I was in my later teens/early 20s due to medical bills. \n\nI have never had bad credit since it was established, but my score tanked last year. I've been able to recover from some of the misfortune I experienced that led to this and have been laser focused on paying this debt off. I work a lot, do side jobs, and every penny I have that isn't spent on immediate necessities goes straight to my debt. I'm self employed and my income varies from month-to-month. So I put anywhere from $1000-$4000 a month towards my debt. I would say my most consistent amount that I pay is $2000-$2500.   \n\n\nI don't know if it benefits my score any better to have a completely paid off card, or to bring down the high balance on card #2. I'm so in the trenches paying this off that I would really appreciate some external input. As well maybe the balance transfer isn't a good idea? Thanks in advance for any advice!",

            "comment": "Unless you need credit (mortgage, car loan) -- the credit score aspect really isn't important, and also it almost certainly doesn't matter the order. \n\nWhat is important is paying off those 27% and 28% balances as soon as possible. It's good you're working hard to pay off that debt. Those rates should be considered an emergency to pay off, it seems like you're treating it that way.\n\nIf you can make $1000 - $4000 per month, just knock out that higher rate, lower balance card #1 entirely next month.\n\nIf you want to use the balance transfer to move $2000 from the 27% card #2, and then be sure to pay off the balance transfer on time, and not use that balance transfer card for any new purchases -- that's a fine plan.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the advice and I appreciate the kind recognition!\n\nI have multiple cards out plus a bit of a student loan left, so the payments are split between all of them. I pay at least the minimum payments + the interest + any purchases made on the cards, such as my phone bill, insurance, etc. That's why paying off the lower balance card isn't as cut and clean as just paying the whole thing next month. I suppose I should mention that since some of my bills are charged to the cards so I can rack up rewards to pay down the cards faster, I'm technically paying some of my baseline bills with those thousands of dollars a month. I feel silly for realizing that now instead of before I posted this. However those bills amount to about $500 a month, so not nearly a majority of what my payments go towards.\n\nI focus the extra payments on larger balances/interest rates to cut down on interest payments.\n\nWithout getting into detail a decent credit score is crucial to my situation at the moment. Especially considering with a better score I'll be able to take out a deliberate balance transfer later so that I would be able to slow down on payments a bit. 90% of my work is manual labor so I'm often risking injuries by working at this rate.\n\nWith that in mind, in your opinion would it still be better in the long run to transfer the amount on Card #1 rather than Card #2?",

I think it just cares about total usage divided by total credit limit. But, I might be wrong.\n\nI think either of your proposed transfer plans will help you pay off your debt a little more efficiently, but neither will change your credit score, since you'll just be moving the usage from one card to another.",

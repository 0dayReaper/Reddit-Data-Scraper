This adds up extremely fast if, like me, you buy almost everything on Amazon.\n\nA [Discover](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/?ICMPGN=PUB_MIDNAV_CREDIT_CARDS) card for 5% cash back on rotating categories.\n\nThe [Citi Double Cash](https://citicards.citi.com/usc/LPACA/Citi/Cards/DoubleCash/ps_A/index.html?cmp=knc|acquire|2006|CARDS|Google|BR&amp;targetid=aud-261786456867:kwd-99517655125&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwm4ukBhAuEiwA0zQxk7Imvp5o8T0wFgHv_i3G8y_p8gOl5_ZZemrk8uBAzV3C8bsKB_wC9xoCbLoQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;ProspectID=PhrzgtxchW1bPw8WybdOq3vKoaBxH4em) card for unlimited 2% cash back on all purchases.\n\nWith these three cards, you will have a VISA, MasterCard, and Discover card.  If a place takes credit cards at all, it will take one of those.  You use the VISA on Amazon, the Discover for whatever category is currently earning 5%, and the MasterCard for everything else.\n\nPay the statement balance in full every month and enjoy free money.  I use this strategy and bring in over $1,000/year.",

Also stick with a reputable company for the long haul so you can build a relationship in case you might default (this came in handy during my senior year when I couldn\u2019t even make the min. They gave me a 60 day grace period).\n\nEvery time a CC is open, your credit takes a small hit so try to ask for a credit increase from your relationship established companies. \n\nIn the end, stay away from CC and short term loans if you can. I graduated Graduate school in 2015 and still have 20% left to go before I\u2019m debt free.",

Find one that works for you personally to give you the benefits you will use most often. Example: if you will be traveling a lot for business then use an airline card (Southwest Airlines, Hawaiian, etc). If you are shopping often at Costco or Amazon then use their cards. \n\n- American Express I don\u2019t recommend. Their fees are very high, not every business accepts them, and their policy is absolutely unforgiving on any missed payments or problems. They will immediately raise your rates even if you miss payments on other cards. \n\n- Department store credit cards will often have the highest APR rates, but no annual fees, with the lowest credit  limits &amp; minimal (if any) benefits. \n\n- beware: high rewards often = high fees.",

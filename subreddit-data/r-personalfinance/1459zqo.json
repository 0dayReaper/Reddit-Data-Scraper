Some people save upwards of 50% or more in seeking FIRE, but the bare minimum is probably 15% as soon as you can. It doesn\u2019t all have to be in your 401k, but that would probably make sense given the tax benefits for someone young.",

Usually the best advice is to invest in a traditional 401k unless you have specific reason for choosing the roth, like if you are in a very low low tax bracket or expect to have substantial income during retirement. As you get older you\u2019ll likely benefit by having some money in all 3 (or 4) account types: traditional, roth, after-tax, and HSA.",

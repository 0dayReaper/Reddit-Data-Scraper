    "postText": "I went to the ATM and I deposited a wad of cash. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how much I put in there, but I think it ate about $260. I am not exactly sure of the amount. All of the branches are closed, so I texted customer service on the Fifth Third app. they told me to stop by the branch first thing tomorrow to get my money back. I was just wondering how likely it is that I get my money back, even if I don\u2019t know exactly how much I put in? Would they be able to figure out how much I put in? What is their process in figuring this out? Thank you I\u2019m stressed lol",

            "comment": "When an ATM has a problem accepting a cash deposit, the money you inserted is diverted into a separate holding area until the machine can be manually audited. Once an employee is able to open and inspect the ATM, you should be credited for the missing amount, though not knowing the exact amount may make it difficult for you to know whether the amount they credit you is correct or not. It may take several days or weeks for this process to fully play out.",

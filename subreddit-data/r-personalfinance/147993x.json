    "postText": "I plan on taking a full time job after being in my current full time job for the past 7 years. This new job will be a promotion but among many things (the position being eliminated, me not meeting the criteria to keep the job in 18 months, etc) there is a possibility of me needing to voluntarily resign near the end of 2024. The good news is I could reapply for the job I am applying for now just a few weeks after leaving when I get new credentials. In all reality I could be out of work for up to 3 months. The one thing I worry about is not having health insurance for that period of time. Is there health insurance a person can buy out on the market? I am 30, do not smoke, and for the most part have few health issues. While I am asking would this health plan out in the market include prescriptions or not? If not, same question, is there prescription insurance out there for people to pay into while between full time jobs with benefits?",

That\u2019s what it\u2019s there for. The policies offered are regular health insurance. Often more expensive if you aren\u2019t poor and don\u2019t have an employer subsidy, but cheaper thaN COBRA, I believe.",

COBRA is retroactive if you sign up, for up to 60 days. \n\nIf you end up not needing health insurance during that window, you paid nothing and got nothing. \n\nIf you do need health insurance during that window, you sign up for COBRA, pay for your policy for that two month window retroactively, and get the coverage. \n\nIf you are about to extend beyond the 60 window, sign up for the public marketplace coverage. It will not be retroactive and you will not owe for the period you were not covered, but you\u2019ll be covered going forward. \n\n\nCheck EVERYTHING in the fine print if you go with this plan.",

This is generally very expensive. Another option is to talk to an insurance broker in your area to give you some prices. Finally, depending on your income, you could purchase from the marketplace. Just know that since the marketplace must cover pre-existing conditions, it can be expensive if you don't qualify for subsidies.",

In my situation this gets tricky because if I must resign it will be in mid/late November 2024 and we lock in our health insurance for the next year by mid October. So could I lock in my insurance picks for 2025 in October 2024, voluntarily resign in November 2024 and then keep my chosen health insurance through all of late 2024 into the end of 2025? I understand I would need to pay the full cost (what I already pay and also what my employer pays) on a bi-weekly basis. Appreciate any help with this btw!",

It\u2019s really for just in case something happens over those 3 months and you need the coverage. Way cheaper than any other insurance because it covers less.

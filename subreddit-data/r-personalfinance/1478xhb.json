    "postText": "27F. Single. I'm currently working in a job that I don't like (BPO), I always wanted to finish my engineering degree which I have tried 4yrs ago while working full time but I stap out due to financial. I'm the breadwinner, supporting my parents. I'm from Philippines by the way, situation like this is very common, supporting parents since they are old, no Savings, no insurance, just depending on their children.  \n\nI'm planning to try again in school, paying it by myself while working full time.  It takes 3 yrs for me to get this diploma.I've been thinking about this lately and been kicking myself for not making it happen years ago. I know I can't change the past but sometimes it's hard to let go the \"supposed to be\" thing. \n\nI'm hesitant because I know for sure I won't have personal savings when I hit 30 and also I'm scared I won't be able to survive again this time. \ud83d\ude14 I can pretty much manage my time. Only my concern is what if I failed again and no savings. And If don't go back to school, I'll be able to save money which I'm good at but still working in this job. \n\nOn the other side, i dont want myself that in 3 yrs. from now Im still looking back and wishing i went for it (college). I'm so confused right now. \nNeed some advice and opinion. Sorry for my English.",

            "comment": "In my opinion, try college again. Get a few more classes and credits to your name. Even if at a later date, you need to take a temporary break from schooling, you can still go back to it again at a later time; it is never a failure to gain education and experience. \n\nIt will be ok to not have personal savings at age 30. When you get your engineering degree, you\u2019ll be able to get a good paying job and make up for a later start to personal savings. (You can work on savings at other stages in your life, and for the rest of your working years for that matter.)\n\nDo not be scared of failure. You have to try. Believe it yourself and your abilities. It will not be easy, but you know this. You also know, you can do this. (If one let\u2019s fear cripple them, then failure has already begun.)\n\nHigher education is an investment in yourself. Education is something that can never be taken away from a person. \n\nBest wishes to you.",

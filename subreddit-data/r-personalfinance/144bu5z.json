    "postText": "After a few short term t-bills, I\u2019m looking to transition to a money market account. My local M&amp;T branch is running a special where they give 3.5% APY interest for the first six months, where each month the interest \u201chits\u201d and therefore compounds quickly, and then it goes down to 2%.  \n\nWhile I want to support regional banks during this time, it seems a bit low.  A quick Google search shows accounts with 3.5%-4.0% APY forever. \n\n**What are some recommended money market accounts?  What\u2019s their interest rate?   Any catches?**\n\nThanks!",

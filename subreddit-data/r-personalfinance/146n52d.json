Looking to buy a 2024 Chevrolet Equinox EV but the trim I find the most cost effective (2LT) doesn't come out until spring 2024.\nWondering if I should just cave and buy the slightly most expensive 2RS (still a great pick i think, just a couple to a few thousand more) which comes out this year instead if it ensures I get the tax credit",

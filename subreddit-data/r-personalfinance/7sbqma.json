    "postText": "Last Tuesday, I did something irresponsible for the sake of my mental health and quit a job where I was miserable, without another job lined up. As the sole income provider this was a huge gamble, but I had an interview on Friday that I was feeling really confident about. \n\nI should pause here to note two things: 1) I'm a codependent, and avoid conflict like the plague. 2) I am this way because of my childhood, being raised by my narcissistic mother. My former boss was exactly like her, hence why I left. \n\nSo, I killed the interview on Friday. Met the two attorneys I would be working for. They are amazing and offered me a job at the end, but said that they would need the senior partner's approval first, so to wait for his call. \n\nI got the call this morning. We went back and forth a little bit. My starting point was $X, he wanted to offer X-$7k. He noted that health insurance is 100% employer-contributed, and not only was I getting 2 more weeks of PTO than my last employer, but I would get PTO on my bday (this is actually an awesome perk because mine almost always falls around a federal holiday, which means the potential for a paid 4-day weekend).\n\nI said meet me at X-5k, so he said he'd do X-7 but cut me a personal check each month for gas allowance. When I incorporated that in, I was almost sold. My husband told me to ask for an additional $50. What's the worst he can say, No?\n\nWell, codependent me was terrified to ruffle the feathers. But I thought, although beggars can't be choosers, I'd potentially miss out on an extra $600 a year for the sake of not hurting someone's feelings. \n\nSo I asked. And he actually said that he was taken aback, and felt like I was nickel and diming him! But you know what? I stuck with it. I said, \"Yes, well, I am very eager to start, so if you can meet me there, I can start tomorrow.\" He said he had to get back to me.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know, he did. I got that extra allowance. I stuck to my guns. I put conflict aside to make sure he knew right off the bat that I know what I am worth. And it felt amazing.\n\nYou miss 100% of the shots you don't take. And let me also just add that it feels really good knowing you're earning a salary you can support a family on, and that you made it happen by being assertive. It's just a huge weight off my shoulders, that I won't have to worry about whether I can pay all the bills on time.\n\nETA: thanks for the gold! :)",

In terms of the mental status, and putting on weight, I literally am in the same position lol.  Probably have gained about 20 pounds and my psyche is not in a good spot either.\n\nThe parts where we differ are I don't have a wife or I would probably be fighting with her as well, and also I did get a raise from my job, in fact I get pretty consistent raises every year, however because I started at such a low salary, way lower than I should've accepted at the start, just now after about 4-5 raises I'm still below 5-7k of similar roles in the area.  Not only that, we are also basically expected to be on-call til around 10-11pm every single day, starting when we sound out a Point of Contact e-mail in the morning.  There's only two of us to cover 7 days a week.  It's a joke. \n\nWell thanks for letting me rant, looking for a job where I can have peace of mind that when I'm off work for the day, I'm off.  ",

So even hoping a new job will fix everything, won't. \n\nI did get a new job- gave me a 20k raise (to what I asked for from the previous company) and since then, I moved within the org to the tune of another almost 20k.\n\nMy mental health is 100x better, and I'm slowly working towards being in better physical health (my wife had a kid, so I lost the weight before Child, then put it back on during/after!)\n\nOne thing I have done, which is most important, is I've grown. I've realized that despite the bad job, I was the one making myself worse. They didn't put food in my mouth, they didn't stop me from going running, and they didn't yell at my family... I did. \n\nBest of luck, hope you find what you're looking for, but most importantly, learn that there's only so much you can control!",

There was a series of elimination tests, then the winners from each province got to go to Toronto for a big practical test and celebration and stuff.\n\nOne year I won, got home, asked for a $1 raise. Got told if I want more money to work harder (mechanics are flat rate, so paid per job, so technically not an untrue statement). \n\nLeft for another job where I make $4/hr more, there is significantly more work to do, and I am appreciated for the skills I have. Only downside is benefits aren't as good and it's farther from my home, but otherwise it's way better.",

It drives me up the wall when I hear \"they can afford it.\" Yes, but that doesn't permit  you to nickel and dime a company for 600 dollars more a year. Imagine a SMB of 500 employees, natrual annual attrition at this level is 6% annually; not even accounting for any growth it's a safe bet to assume any given year this company is hiring upwards of 30 folks. An extra 18k is the minimal added operational cost if everyone asked for additional 600 a year; 60k at 2k more per head; 150k at 5k more head. Now, pragmatically in this singular case of an extra 600/year for OP... it's probably not breaking the bank... but there's a reason enterprises larger than 10 have a dedicated CFO office to assign budgets; they're protecting the business by happlily playing the role of a money-miser. Just as much as OP has a budget to meet so does the business, and just as easily as OP can shave 50 dollars a mos from her annual budget so can the business.. by refusing to expend it. \n\nEdit: am HR + human capital consultant.

Loyalty is very, very frequently an ineffective way to get significant raises, especially int he financial sector.  Switching jobs is where it's at there.\n\nLook at cable/cell phone companies:  All the amazing offers are for new customers.  Been a customer for 10 years?

Tried the knowing if the jobs the right fit for the both of us is something that can't be negotiated and met at a middle ground.  so let's work on that I'm sure we can come to an understanding if we both agree this position is right.\n\n\nSomething along those lines. But they made me say a number he legit got mad and sort of laughed and we both just ended the interview. Sometimes people are just after trying to keep as much profit by finding someone to underpay. And eventually they probably will find someone. I didn't have a lot of experience but I know people at my current job get paid 80-100k with experience i asked for 60k.\nLater on saw a job posting still looking months later that said 32k-45k. It's a 50-60 hour salary job with 100 miles possibly 6 days a week. After costs that's Legit terrible. \n\n\nDon't get knocked down and afraid to negotiate in the future. If your asking for fair pay and doing it professionally. Any company that just doesn't want to pay it probably wasn't right for you in the longer term anyway. Every year you know that raise will be a fight or very low and they expect the most out of the employee. \n\n\nIf your desperate i do understand taking a job temporarily at a lower price but Don't stop looking.

Aced my first interview since quitting and got a salary several grand more than I had in the old job.\n\nFive months later that company fell apart (it was a new startup. This does happen) and I found a new job after less than a week, Got paid even more and even negotiated my salary up again. From my starting point in 2016 I'm up  nearly \u00a37000 per year after six months.\nI'm due a promotion in April too. With attendant pay-rise..\n\n2017 was my year for turning my life around from anxiety-induced depression to the happiest and most confident I've ever felt in a job. So it's good to hear someone else having similarly good experiences\n\nIts not easy to quit a job. Especially when it's because of your boss..\n\nMine asked why I was leaving, I twisted the truth quite badly to avoid saying \"you\"",

Despite the last 5 calls I've said my minimum and wouldn't be moving.\n\nSo I told my line manager what was going on and I'll set up a hand over meeting.

They still are paying you 6400 less then you wanted. Could of at least fought for meeting half and youd be making 3500 more then the offer and 2900 more then what the gas allowance got them.  If there talking about 30k a year vs 37k a year then 600 counts but at the same time you probably can't afford that 7k hit either if 600 matters that much. \n\nThough maybe they knew there asking was high there's no actual backstory there or actual number to go off of.

My initial offer came in at X+3K, which I said was not enough for me to take the gamble on switching companies, along with a significant increase to my commute.  My counter was meet in the middle at X+8K, and add into the contract that in 6months,  I would be up for a review for the additional 5K.  I explained that I was willing to accept less than my desired number,  in order to establish a relationship, and that I am confident in my abilities to perform and earn the additional money.  The recruiter I worked through on this told me that they liked that I was willing to work with them, and that they appreciate someone being willing to prove they are worth the extra vs just holding out for it.  I believe it will start my employment there off on a good foot, where no one is begrudging the negotiations.

            "comment": "This type resolution is an outlier. While it is great OP found a new job and I'm guessing made some more money (I'm assuming X-7 is a higher number than what was previously made coupled with a verbal promise of gas money and 50/mo, I'm doubting the 600/yr and gas exceeds the 2k left on the table by not going for the x-5) but this really was just a lucked out scenario. \n\nI really hope people take the time to really review what actually went on here and don't assume this is a solid strategy for negotiation. The x, x-7 thing is part of the normal negotiation process. But asking for an additional 50/mo in this context demonstrated poor tact and more than likely left a poor first impression. I've seen some comments posted in here praising OP for this and mentioning that \"the manager has some new respect for them\" but I disagree. You get one change to present a first impression and OP presented a poor one. \n\nFuture tips:\n\nIt's acceptable (as the employer demonstrated) to ask for a reasonable amount of time to review the offer. I.e. \"I'd like to discuss this with my *insert person here* I would like to get back to you in x amount of time.\". In that span, even if you desperately need the job but decide to negotiate, figure out exactly if the offer is worth it (do the math on the numbers)\n\nWhile generally \"What the worst they can say, no?\" is a good outlook on things, when it comes in this context maybe refrain from doing this. Yes I get 50/mo is a lot when you don't make a lot - I've been there a number of times - but the impression left is not a good one. The simply reality is 600/yr isn't really a lot of money in the grand scheme of things (I've delivered pizza's in my younger years and pulled that in over the course of a month with tips working a few busy nights a week) so the impression left is one of someone out to squeeze as much water from that stone as possible - at the expense of throwing the entire thing out if you don't get any water. This could've very easily backfired on OP and left them without an offer at all.\n\nFinally - it's been mentioned - but leaving a job before having another lined up should be avoided like the plague. I understand there were issues affecting the mental health of OP, but the realities of how things often play out in this situation are out there for all to see. A lot of people don't land jobs on the first try like this - and the bank doesn't care if your mental health is better when the bills are due. Broke and homeless tends to affect mental health also. My last position change I was able to secure a 20% raise through negotiation - I even turned the job down initially because we were so far apart on the numbers and some other conditions of the job. Those particulars about the job I was able to negotiate out, somethings I got some I did not, but in the end none of that would've been possible without being in a position where I did not \"NEED\" the job for money at the negotiating table.

Also, just know that it's common wisdom that the first party to mention a number loses, because it's impossible for them to end up with a better amount. Some employers will therefore press you hard to give a number first, and though you might be afraid to refuse, they should totally respect you pushing back just as hard, because obviously they think that's perfectly fine behavior since that's exactly what they're doing. When they absolutely insist, then it's perfectly fine to ask for 20% or more above what you want. That's fine even if it sounds outrageous to both parties because it just sets a high anchor, and you can quickly begin negotiating nearer to the real price that both parties expect, but without that ceiling.",

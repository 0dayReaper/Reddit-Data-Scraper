    "postText": "So my dad left me his house, worth about 450k I've lived there about 17 years. His loan refinance was 220K. \nApparently he got a 30 year loan or something the lnDepot won't say, Either way, they don't want to refinance and I guess I have to take on the loan as the house will come to me. (My mom and brothers signed off their claim). \nIt's like 1800 a month and I work 35 hours a week at 20.10 hr but they said I can't even qualify for his loan, Not gonna lie it's looking more like they'll have to pick through my charred remains for scraps because I want to keep this house. \nBut it's like what can I do?",

            "comment": "$1800 per month is 2/3+ of your take home pay, so not advisable. Plus, a home worth 12x your annual income will probably require a lot more maintenance than you can afford.\n\nIf the lender will allow you to assume the loan and you can find some roommates to offset a large portion of the mortgage, you might be able to make this work. But you would be much better off financially to sell the property, take the equity and buy something smaller outright or rent for a while until you are more established.",

If someone leaves you real property you can: refuse it outright (in which case you have no liability), sell it (you will need to keep up mortgage payments until it sells which is likely a few months), or keep it by assuming the mortgage or paying the balance (you do not need to qualify, they have to allow you to accept it as is). Once you\u2019ve assumed the mortgage, you can attempt to refinance with whoever you like.\n\nIf you want to keep it, it\u2019s probably a matter of taking on renters because you don\u2019t have the money to keep up payments.",

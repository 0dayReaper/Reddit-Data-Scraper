    "postText": "I\u2019m currently interning over the summer, and make around $50/hr. The issue is my company currently withholds money as if I made this amount for the full year, but I\u2019ll only be working 16 weeks. I know I\u2019ll get this money back in a refund next year, but I don\u2019t want to give the government interest free money right now and thus want to minimize my withholdings.  \n\nI used the IRS withholding tool, and it shows me the amount that should be withheld each pay period, but how do I come up with the actual number I should put on Line 3 of my W-4? For instance, $50/hr amounts to an annualized salary of around 104K, and I see that the amout currently being deducted lines up with that, so how much of a deduction should I put down to line up with what I'll actually earn?",

In this case, your tax liability is $1958 (based on $32k) as opposed to $15141 (based on $104k).\n\n1. $x / 52 \\* 16 = $1958\n2. x = 6363.5 is the extrapolated annual tax you should *make* the payroll algorithm withhold annually.\n3. To achieve this, put $8777 in step 3 tax credits. \n4. This way, the default annual tax ($15141) based on $104k annual pay is reduced by $8777 to $6364. $6364 / 52 * 16 = $1958.",

                    "comment": "Wouldn't the exemption amount I put down have to bring my taxable income down enough(from 104k) such that it would match a yearly amount corresponding to the amount of tax I should get taken out per pay period? For instance, I'm currently being deducted about $900 every two weeks(federally). Using an online tax calculator I see that if I drop my annual income to about $65,000 my total federal income taxes would be about 12k, which works out to about $500 per pay period, which is about in line with what I should be getting taken out. Wouldn't that mean I'd have to claim an additional exemption(in addition to standard deduction) of about $25K?   \n\n\nIdk if I'm going about this the right way so definitely let me know if I'm not.",

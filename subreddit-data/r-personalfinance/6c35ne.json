    "postText": "So if you're recently graduated, unemployed, or have another life event don't be surprised to see a $12 a month \"account maintenance fee\" if your account has a penny under $1500 at any time throughout the month.\n\nEdit: Congratulations to all the students graduating this month and the next. I know bank fees are the last thing you want to be concerned about while graduating and looking for a job, but it's always important to stay on top of your personal finance and I hope this reminder has been helpful. I know many of you signed up for the account when you were sixteen. I'm glad that this made the front page of Reddit and I thank the mods for stickying this for this month. If just one person saves some money from this reminder, I'll be happy.\n\nEdit 2: If you have a direct deposit of $250+ every month from your job you will also dodge this fee. This post was targeted at the soon to be unemployed so that probably isn't relevant to you however. The comments are full of alternative banks and credit unions with no such fee if you're interested in switching, and [this comment covers how many of the former loopholes people used to avoid this fee have been closed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6c35ne/this_is_just_a_reminder_that_bank_of_america/dhs1b3j/) I also saw a comment that there was a class action lawsuit when a certain amount type had this happen to them, so if you've never seen this fee you may have been grandfathered in under that account type.",

When I was 19, broke and in college, they charged a $10 fee in \"error\" which set off 3 $35 overdraft fees. Took a month to get sorted. Then there's Schwab. Polar opposite. Lived abroad for a few years, never once charged a fee. $8 ATM fee in London, no problem. $5k in unauthorized charges, full refund next day. And their financial services are great. They basically copied Vanguard ETFs, undercut their maintenance fees, and give free transactions on their products. IRA heaven, it is mathematically the cheapest way to own a diversified portfolio. And the customer support on both banking and financial is what sets them over the top. Talk to a competent employee in less than minute guaranteed. I endorse Schwab so heavily on all fronts, and it's odd because I normally dread companies who provide consumer services.",

They happily provide you services and in trade they get to loan out and make money off of your money.\n\nIf you have little or almost no money in your account, any service they provide to your account is a loss. Fees and such are their way of recouping the costs of providing service to these expensive for them, low balance accounts so that they can provide lower loan rates, pay better interest rates to account holders with larger balances, CDs, etc, and make more profit overall.\n\nDefinitely find the bank that provides you the services you need for as low a cost to you as possible, but those are some of the reasons banks charge fees for services (particularly if you have under $X in your account).",

One is to give the cash to a trusted friend/loved one who has a brick-and-mortar bank, and have them write you a check for the same amount. Then you deposit the check via mobile app, they deposit cash via their bank. I know, it's kind of a hassle. \n\nI've been banking online for ~6 years now and this limitation hasn't been too much of a drawback. For me it's outweighed by benefits like lack of fees, interest on checking accounts, and good customer service.",

My wife who doesn't work has a debit card tied to a separate personal checking account, but money is \"swept\" from our main account into her account daily when her personal checking account balance drops down below $1000.  This type of arrangement is easy to setup in person if you have a knowledgeable personal banker, and it can be tweaked easily, but is virtually impossible to explain or setup over the phone with a rep from an online only bank, like Ally.\n\nOther examples are when conducting large transactions.  I had a stretch of about two weeks where I was buying and selling some real estate, and it so happened that my (owned clear) car was hit while parked and wrecked.  \n\nBecause of the pending real estate transactions, I was not able to make any large purchases on credit, but I still needed to replace the car.  Insurance was going to adjust the claim, which would take 5-7 days plus a week or so for the funds to show up.  \n\nI walked into my local branch and talked to the guy who already knows me.   His solution was nice.   He put a lien on the car for it's full book value before the accident, handed me a cashier's check for that amount made out the dealership where I was going to buy a new car.   Then the check from the insurance payoff had the banks name on it before mine, and two weeks later I just came in with the check, handed it off to banker, which paid off the lien.  Whole thing cost me $0, and took about 1 hr to setup and execute on both ends.  \n\nThat's the type of thing most people don't need, but can be very worth it to use a large commercial bank.  ",

At $7 a trade, that's significant savings. There's a number of other boosters like credit card rewards, discounts on mortgages and auto loans that make great financial sense. ",

My parents opened an account for me when I got my first job at 16, and I've only had 2-3 fees in the 7-8 years I've had the account open, all due to overdraft. They even waived a deposit fee when their ATMs weren't working (there was a small processing fee to deposit checks and cash at a teller in the physical location.)\n\nMaybe this was all simply because I wasn't of age yet, as I'm just turning 24 now. But I've been both in and out of school with not a dime in my account for months, and never noticed any maintenance fee, but I'll be sure to look for one now, even though I have a regular job with direct deposit, and more than the minimum balance.",

            "comment": "I had an account with BoA when I was about 15 years old and knew jack shit about money. I ended up overdrafting by about 10 cents or so: the next day, it had turned into multiple rolling overdrafts both at end of day and opening, leaving me at about $140 in charges. My dad, who is one of the quietest people I know and a former banker, took one look at the scheme they had employed, promptly went down to the branch I frequented, and proceeded to absolutely lose his shit on the ice queen of a manager that was in charge. He himself had worked for BoA many years prior to that, and had a SIZEABLE account with them...by the time we walked out of there that day, they had lost my account as well as the bulk of his, and they were seriously confused as to why he was so angry. \n\nI understand now, obviously, but at the time this happened, dad basically explained to me that they used a VERY suspicious rolling overdrafts model that was later quietly taken away. \n\nCredit unions for life.

Also, most CU's work together to avoid charging fees to each other's customers and even accept deposits on behalf of partner CUs.   \n\nThe level of service is astronomically better compared to a bank focused on creating shareholder value.

Each of them have pros and cons (big bank- MANY locations, credit union - great rates on loans, online bank - great APY on savings accounts). I've never incurred a single fee at any institution. Why? Cause I **read** the account requirements. ",

I received a letter from them recently that in June they are changing checking accounts to *green* accounts, with a monthly fee. The list of things they are offering as benefits were already included, with a couple added on,  like some kind  of healthcare sundries discount plan and weird stuff like that.  Thankfully, they still have the basic checking, but you have to opt out of the changeover. I was  shocked to receive the letter, I never expected them to take this route of *selling* services and  disguising them as *monthly fees*. Some of the services they are touting are  already offered by Visa. ",

You do not have enough money to meet the DD. You can't get ebanking accounts anymore. This is a checking not saving account so the 25 dollar thing doesn't work. He probably has lost a student waiver so that doesn't work either. It's not about reading the fine print. He's most likely complaining because after reading the fine print, they don't offer viable student options. ",

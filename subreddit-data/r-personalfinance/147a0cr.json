    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis is my first post! I recently graduated from college at 22. I managed to land a high paying job in the tech industry in Washington State. I\u2019ll be making $103K per year before tax. I have around $60K in debt (student loans, car lease, etc). I plan to repay that in my first year of employment. I\u2019ll be living with my parents rent free since it\u2019s very close to the job location and they require assistance. I currently have around $10K in my bank account, no other assets or investments. I plan to maximize my Roth IRA account, and max out my 401K since I get employer matching once I start work. I\u2019m looking for opportunities to build wealth. I would appreciate any advice on how to escape the matrix early. People tell me to get into real estate, but I have zero experience in that. I was thinking of doing AirBnB. I would love for someone to walk me through the process. Please feel free to share any feedback or advice you have for me. Looking forward to seeing your comments. \n\nBig Thanks!!",

Focus on becoming proficient at your job first before branching out into anything that requires work and effort (like real estate or AirBnBs).  You haven\u2019t even started work yet.  Forget about \u201cescaping the matrix early\u201d for now.\n\nAlso, if by Washington State you mean the Seattle area, I know $100K seems like a huge amount and more money than you\u2019ve ever seen in your life.  While that\u2019s true, it won\u2019t go nearly as far as you think, especially once you eventually move out on your own.",

You would do well to read the wiki here, and prime directive, and referenced books and resources.  \n\nLive as if you are still on a college budget.  Roommates and eating/spending habits of a broke college kid.  Lifestyle creep is real and will rob you of the r/fire future.",

    "postText": "I'm 34, unmarried, no kids and none planned (my partner and I are both sterilized). I live with my long-term partner  (42 m) in a house he owns. The mortgage is paid off. He has no debt. I will have my car paid off by spring of next year and have no other debts. We both have health insurance and STD/LTD through our employers. He has no life insurance. I have term life insurance through my job and a whole-life policy to take care of funeral expenses and leave a nice gift for my surviving beneficiaries or a charity of choice. He has about $20k in a 401k from a former employer. I've only been in a position to contribute to a 401k or IRA for about 2 years, so I only have a few thousand in my accounts.\n\nI'm currently looking into LTC insurance, since I know the cost of assisted living and nursing care is cuckoo and I know that Medicare doesn't cover custodial care (and who knows what the state of Medicare will be 30+ years from now?). There is a history of Alzheimer's and dementia in my family, and spinocerebellar ataxia runs in my father's family. Health history aside, I could always have a stroke in my later years or fall and break a hip. Either way, there's a decent chance I may need some amount of custodial care, albeit hopefully not for a couple of decades.\n\nI know LTC offers limited compound inflation protection and in my state (OH) protects personal assets equal to the policy amount from surrender to Medicaid.  But - I don't have any assets, and I'm not concerned about leaving wealth behind. Is LTC the best vehicle to save for potential custodial care expenses in the future, or would it make more sense to look into an annuity? Is there a different savings/investment vehicle that would make more sense is my situation?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. I can budget a few hundred dollars a month, but that amount will rise drastically in about a year.\n\nEDIT: I earn just over $60k/yr, excluding annual bonus and OT. My partner earns just over $105k/yr (salaried), plus bonus and commission.",

            "comment": "Curious to see what else is posted here.  \n\nWhen I looked into LTC a few years ago, the consensus seemed to be that it was ridiculously expensive and most insurers had ditched the product all together because of how expensive long term care is.  If you were lucky, you bought a policy 20 years ago and it isn't eating your lunch.\n\nThe plans that were available seemed to have benefit caps that really seem to limit their usefulness for doing what you hope they would do - cover your care in old age or certainly in a scenario when you aren't making decisions for yourself. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I left it alone at that point.",

He paid ~$350/mo in premiums for ~$4500/mo benefit for 4 years once approved.\n\n  Funny/sad side: since, as you said, a lot of insurers ditched their policies it got increasingly difficult to find anyone there that knew what to do.  Getting it started took multiple phone calls because we needed 'Joe' to get anything done.  Most phone support people had little knowledge.  The web site had zero access to the info, so it was useless.  \n\n  Annoying side: it took 6 months before we saw a dime of payback.  Approvals, waiting periods, more approvals, evaluations, etc took time.  Thankfully we had access to cash to bridge the gap.  You certainly need someone you trust to manage it and your money.\n\n  Also annoying but makes sense, sadly: you pay premiums while executing on the policy, so the payout is benefit-premiums.  It makes sense, but given the scenario its another eyeroll.\n\n  Sad side: my FIL was sold on the policy applying to in-home care.  The policy specifically did not apply to in-home care, so he was very upset and increasingly confused on the days when the dementia was less and he wasn't at home anymore... nor could afford to be.",

My Mom for example is in a nice private Memory Care for Dementia for $10, 300/mo. It went up $760/mo this January. We're paying with proceeds from the sale of their home (Dad is gone) and her SS and 1/2 his Pension that he used to get. She does not require skilled care if she did it would be on average $12K+, a nice one by me is $16K/mo. No insurance.Medicare does not cover Long Term Care ever but is a Federal Program the same no matter where you live.\n\nMedicaid on the other hand is income and needs based, administered by each state. So the rules are different in each state and that is important.\n\nI'm a retired RN and used to do assessments for LTC policies back in the late 80s/90s. Often people were trying to get policies too late when Cognitive Decline had already set in and their children were trying to get it for them.\n\nOther younger people were getting them to protect themselves/assets. Back then $100 a day was considered good coverage, you could get a Live In Aide for $200-250/week. Some of those people are in the midst of needing care now and it doesn't cover anything. An hourly CNA is $25-45/hr, they've changed the labor laws to include these as hourly employees who require overtime in numerous states resulting in this being undoable for the CNAs or families.\n\nMany people do Medicaid/Estate Planning to leave their assets to their children/heirs, HOWEVER getting a Medicaid bed can be very difficult and getting decent care even harder. It's a growing Epidemic in our country, millions of families trying to take care of ill, frail, often a danger to themselves elderly people who can not be left alone for a minute.\n\nFrom what I'm hearing more recently these policies are extremely expensive. There is supposed to be some type of Hybrid policy out there of LTC and Life Insurance where if it's not used the money can flip to a Life Insurance Policy and be Inherited or at least most of it. That might be worth looking into.\n\nAs someone else mentioned I've heard to hold off until at least late 50s because the Premiums go way up after 60? Though any one of us can get in a catastrophic car wreck or even fall the wrong way in your shower and need the care.\n\nLikely someone has a formula if you took $500/mo and invested/saved where it would be by say age 70ish for the optimistic ...",

            "comment": "My opinion:  LTC is a scam.  POA to several elderly people.  Have a relative who bought two separate policies for themself and their spouse (so four total).  Obtained them many, many years ago and paid a boatload of money into them.  \n\nThey went into skilled nursing.  I was unable to get the policies to pay.  And when I read them in depth, the reimbursable amount was laughably small and had a top limit.  \n\nThe skilled nursing administrator said that she had *never* seen a policy payout.  \n\nFor the amount of money that was spent, an index fund would have been a much better investment.  \n\nAlso my opinion:  managing your own money is better than an annuity.  As far as I can tell, annuities don't end up in unclaimed property so if nobody knows about them it's possible you may never collect the funds if you're unable to manage your own affairs.  Or if you forget.  I went through tons of relatives' paperwork and found some annuities that hadn't been paid out.  Took quite a while to get it sorted.  \n\n(Not directed at you personally)   Not sure I really understand people's reluctance to spend money on their own care or to keep it out of the hands of medicaid.  Medicaid isn't stealing the money; it's a program designed to help low-asset, low-income individuals.  And there's such a wide variation in skilled nursing facilities; I would never put a loved one in a medicaid-only facility if the money is there.  Usually the need is time-sensitive as well and you're trying to rush to get a good placement.  \n\nTLDR:  Good retirement savings are essential.",

    "postText": "My husband and I inherited assets from my FIL when he passed away. My FIL intentionally excluded my husband's two siblings from his estate planning and left $100,000 in investments to husband and me. We now each have an individual brokerage account with Edward Jones for $50,000. This is how FIL set up beneficiaries.\n\nMy husband and I want to distribute some of this to his siblings. Can we do this, and what is the best way? Can we, for example, create two new accounts, one for Sibling A and one for Sibling B, and transfer $25,000 to each of them? Do the siblings need to first open brokerage accounts with Edward Jones? I would prefer not to sell the mutual funds and give them the money, to minimize tax consequences. (Am I thinking about taxes and capital gains correctly? )",

As long as you\u2019re doing it very soon after his death or alternate valuation date (six months later, if the executor set it up that way), taxes for selling should be little or none.  Taxes are based on the difference between the value now and when he died, not when he originally bought them.\n\nYou likely should sell all of it and start over again, as the investments and mutual funds that were appropriate for an elderly person in retirement are probably not appropriate for you.  Again, as long as you do this soon after inheriting or the alternate valuation date, little or no tax consequences.",

It should involve signing some forms and have a brokerage account set up for the recipient. \n\n~~In order to avoid taxes~~ (in order to avoid reporting! Sorry!), that value would have to be under the [annual exclusion amount for each recipient](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes) For 2023 that amount is $17k",

Any amount over will count towards your lifetime gift exclusion amount of $12.06 million. So unless you've also exceeded the lifetime exclusion (highly unlikely) you will not owe any gift taxes.\n\n[https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/estates/the-gift-tax-made-simple/L5tGWVC8N](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/estates/the-gift-tax-made-simple/L5tGWVC8N)",

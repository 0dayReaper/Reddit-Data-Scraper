Not only will it get the debt paid off quicker and get your money back to working for you quicker, but the higher payments will force you to make some cuts to your spending, a couple of years of that will help build the discipline of spending less than you earn.  Once it's over, you can start putting the same money into savings and start building some wealth.",

That\u2019s why there are so many people saying you\u2019re going to find yourself quickly in the same spot, except now with an extra loan on your 401(k).\n\nSpecifically, what did you used to do that got you into this mess that you are no longer doing? Eating out for lunch at work? Shopping on Amazon? What? \u201cI need to be more careful,\u201d or \u201cclean-up my act\u201d or whatever, isn\u2019t going to help you, because if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll just keep living the same way.\n\nYou need to actually sit down and write a budget and stick with it for at least a month to make sure you\u2019ve actually stopped digging the hole. Realizing you screwed up and stopping it are different things. I say this being guilty of it myself. I used to talk a lot about how I needed to clean up my spending act while I was still eating out for lunch every day at work, for example.\n\nSo what specifically are you going to change, how much was that costing you before, and how much is it going to save you now? Use an app like mint or something to track your spending and figure out where it\u2019s going.",

But as others have said, it's important to make sure you're not in this situation again in the future.\n\nCheck out YNAB (You Need A Budget) r/YNAB! It's a zero-based budgeting software where you have to assign all of your money to your goals or spending categories. One of the best features is that when you spend on a credit card it automatically will move money from the spent category to the credit card payment category. This eliminates the possibility of creating new debt because your ACTUAL dollars are actively being moved and accounted for.\n\nThere's a decent learning curve to the software but there are tons of great videos and r/YNAB is also super helpful. There's a monthly sub fee or it's $100/year (annual sub is cheaper than monthly) and there's a 34 day free trial. It's worth at least looking into! Some people bitch and moan that it shouldn't cost what it does, but quite frankly $100 year to help me meet my financial goals and not go into debt is super worth it in my opinion!",

On paper, borrowing from the 401k is the No brainer financial choice. \n\nNobody is saying borrowing from a 401k is a great thing. But having 15k in cc debt is not a great thing either, obviously. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re starting from scratch and borrowing 401k for a future vacation. \n\nWhen you borrow from a 401k, not only are you turning 20%+ interest debt into market% interest debt \u2014 all the interest payment is being paid back to yourself.  A 401k Loan on paper is a wonderful tool to get yourself out of bad debt \n\nThe downsides are off paper. It encourages bad spending habits. And many places you have to pay off  the whole Loan if you lose your job.\n\nThose are downsides you have to weigh in to the decision. But from a purely on paper financial decision, I think it\u2019s important to note it\u2019s a very strong tool. You go from flushing 20%+ interest payments down the toilet to paying yourself back that interest.",

Many people have noted the \u201crobbing your future self\u201d issue to this point which I second. Rather than taking the money directly from your 401(k) you can reduce your 401k(k) contributions to allow you extra money to pay down your debt. If possible, my recommendation would be to lower your contribution down to what your company is willing to match, and use the money you are now taking home to pay down debt. If you have a solid plan you can stick to going forward, I think you could even risk the loss on match for a short period of time if it means you are debt free faster. If you\u2019re willing to do the math, you can also guess how much you would lose out of the market with the 15k loan vs how much match you would miss out on and use that in your decision making.\n\nEdit: sorry to come back so late, but one thing no one (that I\u2019ve seen) has mentioned is that if you leave the company at any point during the loan life, you could be on the hook immediately to pay it all back, so you\u2019ll need to have a contingency plan ready in case that were to happen.",

If you bought the car before the interest rate hikes I\u2019m gonna say your interest rate is 3-4% . You can\u2019t get that now . Your credit card debt might have a high interest rate , but there are many 0% cards you could roll the balance to for a whole year and pay it off with 11 equal payments . I would keep the car loan if the interest rate is low . Roll the credit card debt . Or get a car equity loan to pay off the credit card debt for a fixed payment for 4 yrs . Then set your payments to 24 months and pay off early . Good luck",

Let yourself feel the emotions and actually take the time to plan out measurable change in your behavior. It sounds like you want an out so you don't need to actually grow an change. Do the hard work now. You won't regret it! It's only a year if you can buckle down. That's not bad. You need to get a real handle on your finances one way or another, nows the perfect time.\n\nAlso run a compound interest calculator and look at what your 401k will be when you retire if you continue to contribute without taking it out. Money in when your younger does better for you because it has more time to compound. Like put in the calculations 20k with retirement in 20 years, versus 20k and retirement in 40 years and look at the huge difference. \n\nLay out your credit cards with debt and interest rates. I'm sure someone here can help you with the snowball method and if you lay out expenses  start with a budget too. I know it feels overwhelming at first, but it gets easier. Using cash to buy helps you see what you're spending on, and gives you more of a pause than just swiping cards, so that might be a good thing for you to try.",

I would be lying if I said I didn\u2019t regret it now, that money would be so much more now but I was in a debt cycle that would\u2019ve continued to bring me down. So yes, currently I may not have the pension that I want, but I also live a far better life today because I made that choice. At 47 I am completely debt free, not something many people can say. \n\nThis is life, short term is as important as long term.

What\u2019s the point?\n\nThis said, no point in spending your pension if you don\u2019t repair the issue. Make sure that the spend is a solution and not a plaster. Make it worth it.

If you reduce your 401k contributions you will miss out on the tax benefit and contribution room (this isn't Canada, you can't put it in next year) forever.\n2. Ignore the \"double taxing\" of the repayment amount. It isn't material because you are also paying back the other debt with after-tax dollars.\n3. By taking out the 401k loan you are missing out on the returns in the market, but you are also paying _yourself_ interest instead of the bank. You are also missing out on losses in the market.\n4. Don't do it if your plan is one of the few that won't let you continue to contribute.\n\nDepending on your interest rate on the loans, and assuming that you don't use this as an excuse to get back into the exact same situation, this might not be a bad idea.\n\nSince 2018 your loan won't be due in 60 days and some plans will let you pay it back on the original term.\n\n&gt; You get until the federal tax deadline the following year to do so \u2014 i.e., if you leave your job in June 2022, you generally would get until April 18, 2023, to come up with the funds for the rollover (although if you file a tax extension, you\u2019d get longer).\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/leaving-your-job-heres-what-will-happen-to-that-401k-loan-you-have.html",

From there found some others that really helped with similar ideas (Caleb Hammer is a good one on youtube). I was honest about my spending to my wife and we got on the same page (she reciprocrated).

Since you are doing so, id give you a better chance than you think to do it right. \n\nIf you are trying to do a quick credit repair, this will help you. That credit score will jump. But what a credit score tells you is that you are good with debt. Which means lenders will be happy to give you more debt...be careful!",

Id argue you shouldn't be taking on any more debt so your score shouldn't matter, so better to just pay off the loan rather than involving your 401k. Instead of taking the 401k money I think it's more prudent to save that money from your paychecks (you'd have to use it to pay off the 401k anyway) and use it to pay the loan. Ideally a few hundred more than what you would be able to contribute from the 401k here.",

    "postText": "I used to Lyft Line or Uber Pool to work everyday or every other day so this was nearly ~$10 everyday so $200-250/month just for that. In addition I use uber/lyft to get around the city for meeting up with friends, getting groceries, going to meetups etc and that added up a lot. I was so shocked by this because even though the charges are tiny up front they really add up. \n\nSo a few months ago I invested in a nice road bike for $900 and its been solid so far and my Lyft usage dramatically went down. If I am going somewhere &lt;2.5 miles I bike. I live in SF so hills can get pretty crazy so I also avoid areas that are further in the city. Its even cheaper than public transport - which would cost me close to $100 every month to get to work. Instead monthly bike maintenance is &lt;$10 and I can use public transportation to go further into the city. I only use lyft/uber now if I am drunk or need to get to places that neither public transport or my bike can.\n\nSomething I thought this sub might enjoy\n\n**Edit:** A lot of questions around why I used Lyft/Uber and Taxi so much when SF is such a walkable city and it has great public transportation. \n\nNo real reason besides I was stupid and incredibly lazy with terrible habits. I moved to SF fresh out of college a year ago and I work in Tech so the salaries are pretty good. I wasn't disciplined about my finances for a while - as a matter of fact I wasn't until the last few months and then expenses racked up and I started building a credit balance. I used to use public transportation a lot and then I moved to a place where it was a little far so I got lazy and started taking Lyft and this became such a habit that 4-5 months in I was taking it everywhere. \n\nI also used to call it all the time whenever friends/family was in town and never split. $750 does say a lot about me. Bad habits are so easy to foster. But now I am more disciplined in this matter. I was careless. But I am self-aware enough to call myself out - only in this case I could've done it early; but that's alright because I did and made a lot of progress. \n\nSo if you are 22 and are like me and have bad habits that alright. Call yourself out. Block a few hours on a weekend, and do nothing but understand your financial habits and make a budget to the last penny. It might anxiety at first but then you'll get a hold over it and it'll be alright.\n\n**Edit:** Holy shit. This got way more attention than I wanted. A lot of good advice - thank you for that. Thank you to all the people that were being nice. To the ones that reached out to me to be mean - try to be nice. \n\nI did invest in a good U lock and I also have a cable lock. When I'm at work I take it straight to my desk but when I go grocery shopping I usually lock it with the U-lock and also use the cable lock with the tires. It worked well so far. \n\nI also cook everyday so that ~$50 a week on groceries and I eat out about ~30 worth every weekend. so about ~$350 in eating a month. A lot of people reached out asking for advice - I will get back to you this weekend. ",

Just remember to lock it even when it's in one of those spaces, or if you store it in a shared area of your apartment building.\n\nBike locks are for when you absolutely have to lock your bike outside, and there's no other choice. If you get in the habit of locking outside, you *will* come back to find your ride missing, no matter how well it was locked. ",

The fact that a thief would need an allen wrench to get my front wheel makes it more protected than most bikes around where I park, and front wheels are pretty cheap, so it's probably not worth stealing mine.",

In Belgium (lots of bikes) if you report your bike stolen, you can go to the police warehouse where they store \"lost and abandoned\" bikes and check if yours is in there. You give a vague description (black mens bike, broken rear light,...) and go look for the nicest bike that vaguely fits that. They engrave it with your national number and you get it back. \n\nThey can never identify owners of these unmarked bikes anyway, and are happy to get rid of it out of their warehouse. They don't care. ",

I didn't even try the 13mm u-lock but I'm fairly confident I'm safe against bolt cutters (what they used to steal my last bike).\n\nBoth are also double-locking so even if you do get through you're going to need to cut twice to get it out. Not to mention the two combined weigh as much as some people's bikes. \n\nSo what does $300 and 3kg of gold-rated hardened steel locks buy you against an angle grinder? [1 minute 52s for the chain and 1m57s for the ulock](http://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/1381/cycling-locks-tested-until-breaking-point). And that's for a locking solution that will be far too expensive, clumsy and heavy for the average bike user. Certainly more than the $20 u-locks I've seen at uni campuses.\n\nSo at the end of the day even the top of the line is only going to buy you five minutes of peace of mind :(\n\n",

Probably 6.7L/100kms commuting. \n* Chain / Sprockets need replacing every 12,000-24,000 depending on make/brand/quality and can set you back $300 each time replacing.\n\nOther than that - There are costs that aren't considered:\n\n* Gear - Helmet, Jacket, Gloves, Pants, Boots, Knee/Shin Pads (I use sometimes when wearing Kevlar Jeans) can cost around $1,500+ for quality items, or $800+ for cheaper items (Still loads better than no gear)\n* Upgrades: Exhaust, ECU/Flash/Tune, Upgraded airbox (saves money later), Upgraded oil filters (Saves time later), Cosmetic changes (i.e. indicators, mirrors, bar ends, grips, tank pads)\n* Accessories: Phone mounts, Bluetooth kit (Helmet), Tank/Rear seat bag/Backpack \n* Advanced Rider Training: This is more of a necessity to get riders heads out of their ass (Yes... all riders... Including cruisers, sports, dirtbike etc.etc.). You're not Rossi, but you'll probably be Marquez and take out a whole bunch of other people if you don't use a bit of common sense. Use these courses to understand how to control your bike, but mostly - figure out the limits of braking, cornering, hazard perception etc.etc. It's all an investment to better yourself later. \n\n-\n\nIn saying all of that, wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. Commuting on a motorcycle saves a lot of time  (Filtering) &amp; isn't boring like commuting in a car. \n\nThere are inherent risks of crashing &amp; being injured, but those risks are also in a car, walking to work etc. 90% of the time, it'll be rider error that results in a crash. (Hence taking advanced rider training). Anyone who gets on a bike and doesn't think they'll ever crash is kidding themselves or rides once a year. Also, any rider that blames other cars, gravel, oil or whatever the fuck to anyone other than the insurance company &amp; first responders is lying to themselves. Sure, there are situations where you can't avoid (rear ended for example), but 90% of riders will mindlessly blame an avoidable accident on oil on the road. That car pulling out in front of you? - Probably avoidable. You can see cars eager to pull out &amp; you can always prepare by slowing down in preparation for them to do something silly. \n\nAnyway... rant over. Bikes are fun. :) \n\nEdit: Fixed a word. ",

He was luckily mostly fine except a fractured clavicle.\n\nYes, the risks on a motorcycle are more severe for consequences, but the fact is - risks considered, it comes down to the mentality of the rider. \n\nI've had several crashes, both on track &amp; on road. I've ended up under a car and walked away without a scratch and just a bit of whiplash for a week. I've come off doing a wheelie at 146km/h and got road rash. I've come off doing 160km/h in a race trying to overtake and I ran out of tyre.  \n\nI have taken responsibility for each of the crashes as mistakes I've made and use them to improve. \n\nRiders who end up as statistics are the ones who deny that there was anything they could've done and go out and make the same mistakes again. The mentality that \"It's not my fault, she cut me off\" makes the rider believe there is nothing they could've done. maybe instead of \"It's not my fault, she cut me off\" it could be seen as \"I was in her blind spot\" or if at a T-intersection you could say \"This car might pull out in front of me.. Let me adjust my road position so they can see me &amp; prepare to stop if they pull out anyway\". \n\nSimple things like being able to slalom properly, efficiently and quickly to avoid hitting something is a skill many riders fail to remember in an emergency. I've seen videos of easily avoidable accidents on YouTube that riders would prefer to attempt to brake, rather than ride around. ",

Downtown there are lanes separated from driving lanes with a concrete medium for bikes, and bike lanes in intersections are marked with a solid green lane to remind drivers to watch for bikes. \n\nWhen I went to Europe, the infrastructure for bikes was absolutely incredible, I'd actually use the word inspiring.

I suppose it isn't going to be a Tesla Model S or 7 Series BMW, but you know, sacrifices must be made.\n\nWith that said, a bike and bus/train pass sure seems like the obvious solution.\n\n",

I used to use Muni a lot and then I moved to a place where Muni/Bart is a little far so I got lazy and started taking Lyft and this became such a habit that 4-5 months in I was taking it everywhere. I also used to call it all the time whenever friends/family was in town and never split. $750 does say a lot about me. Bad habits are so easy to foster. But now I am more disciplined in this matter.

It's free exercise, good transportation, and you can honestly deal with the rain if you get a good rain jacket. \n\nSome suggestions:  \n\n1) get a u lock and cable combo if you haven't already. This is extra deterrent from thievery. Always try to lock the back tire through the frame if you can get away with it. \n\n2) get your bike outfitted with fenders. When it rains or you have puddles to deal with, you will thank me. \n\n3) lube your chain. It takes 10 seconds once a week. It will make your chain and gears run better and last longer. \n\n4) check your tread and tire pressure. Ditto. Once a week or if you feel your ride change suddenly. \n\n5) get your bike serviced every 6 months- if you're cheaper you can do it yourself, but I generally get my bike done for under $100 with the cost of parts. \n\n6) get a box on back or panniers and bungees. I can get two grocery bags worth of stuff on my bike and you can too. \n\n7) get a bell- a nice chiming one that people can hear in cars. It will save your life at some point and it's very cheery. \n\n8) lights and reflective stickers- if you go out at night, be bright!\n\n9) happy riding and be safe!  SF is a bit of a bicycle jungle.

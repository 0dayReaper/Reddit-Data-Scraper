    "postText": "Hey all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: I moved into an apartment with a roommate a few months back so I could work in a specific city, now my job is wrapping up and I am trying to move out. I paid my rent to my roommate so that they could pay the landlord with one check. Many months back, the roommate's account over drafted on a rental payment so the landlord demanded we send in a cashier's check and invoiced us a late fee. My roommate assured me that it would be paid, and since it was their fault, they would handle it. Each time I apply for an apartment in another city, I keep getting screened out due to \"rental history.\" I was getting very confused so I assumed that it was due to me having a shorter rental history as I worked as a resident assistant for about three years and got my housing from that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I found out that my roommate has not being paying the late fee for the past nine months, and in fact has been accruing a new one every month since. In addition, they have not paid the rent or utilities for the past two months. I have electronic payment records of sending these funds over to my roommate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to know two things:\n\n1. What can I do to ensure that I can get past the screening process when property management companies check with my current landlord?\n2. What steps can I take to reduce my liability to this debt, if at all?\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am still a tenant. This is a month-to-month lease. I am looking for a new apartment in another city so I can go to post-grad in August. \n\n\nEdit 2: fuck",

Credit reports are a tool to determine how well someone manages their financial responsibilities and obligations, which is the primary thing that landlords care about.\n2. \"Only report negatives\": No one is required by to report anything to the bureaus (in general, there are specific exceptions), though I've worked at a company that was required to do so via contract with the bureaus we used, every month for each user that there was a change in status for. As long as you aren't going further late in your payments, for a revolving credit line with a constant charge like a lease, one's status on the Metro2 report doesn't change.  \nAlso, as someone who has written software that deals with financial reporting: Technically, no one reports \"on time\" payments; there is no field in the format to. Instead, what is reported to the credit bureaus is how late and in-arrears the creditor is (if you are always on time, the answer to both of those is zero; if you missed one payment, those amounts remain constant; if you are continually missing payments, the amounts get worse).",

This was in 2018, and the reason I had to have 3 roommates. Rent control was needed about $2000 ago. \ud83d\ude02\n\nDorchester is not a great area and definitely doesn\u2019t deserve the high price tag I was forced to pay. I love Boston but 99% of the reason I left was it being unbearably unaffordable.\n\nI\u2019ll do some reading (or just call the city\u2019s housing department, lol) and see if I can find anything specifically about how tenants should pay. I\u2019d hate to be spreading misinformation, but every time I asked in the past I was told it was the rule or some law! Maybe it\u2019s similar to SF in that way, or maybe it\u2019s a quirk of how joint tenant contracts work in Boston.\n\nInterestingly, there was never a \u201cmaster\u201d tenant \u2014 it was strictly equal on all my joint leases, and it was up to us to choose the unlucky person who had to collect rent for the landlord (in the Dorchester instance, me).

If he explains the situation, has an income and DTI ratio that demonstrates he is able to afford rent at the next place (a cosigner would help the case,) OP will probably find something. Best bet is with a landlord that isn't a gargantuan company with strict internal rules. Luckily for OP rates are high right now, so he might be able to find a vacancy somewhere that is in a hurry to fill a lease, and to perhaps bend the rules or at least consider the situation.\n\nEdit: Also, I wouldn't necessarily say most renters have that policy. Anecdotally, a work buddy just listed a unit on popular listing sites, and it was moreso a setup that highlights the red flags and allows the renter to review the specifics and make a decision. It is just an anecdote, but I suspect there is probably a landlord or two out there with maybe a little too much empathy for their own good perhaps. Also, I just noticed that OP is still in school so hopefully they have a parent or relative that will cosign.",

            "comment": "Everyone is correct in that legally you are on the hook. But here\u2019s what I would try \u2014 assemble all of your paperwork showing the monthly transfers to your roommate (highlight the line item so they\u2019re easy to see) and print out any text messages you have of your roommate saying he paid the rent or late fees and anything related. \n\nNine months of late fees + two months back rent is a lot of money. **You should absolutely file a lawsuit in small claims court**. You don\u2019t need an attorney and the filing fee is small. \n\nYes, he may not pay \u2014 but judgements are taken out of tax returns and other types of payments so you could still potentially get a check in the future. \n\nAdditionally, this strengthens your case that you believed the rent was being paid on time. Again, make sure to save any text messages of him confirming he paid the rent or the late fees or a \u201cHey did you send the check?\u201d, Oh yea it\u2019s in no worries\u201d etc. \n\nThen go talk to your landlord and grovel. Show them the proof that you were told these payments were made, he expressly told you they were, you had no clue he wasn\u2019t actually paying and you feel terrible because it\u2019s causing all these huge problems and if you had known you would have just paid directly and this is ruining your career and your sorry etc etc. \n\nSee if they would be willing to acknowledge in the screening program that you did pay on time and remove the late fee notices + non-payment records. Maybe offer to bring the account whole now. \n\nAs far as current applications maybe look for smaller rental companies or private landlords &amp; explain the rental history issue. You could even try following up with some that rejected you and explain what happened, that you\u2019re taking legal action against him, that you can send proof your payments were made on time. \n\nIt\u2019s not a guarantee but acknowledging you were naive and making a genuine attempt to correct things can get people to bend the rules a little sometimes. \n\nYou will need to figure out a way to get the account up to date though because that will go to collections. What you\u2019re focusing on now is just getting your screening software profile updated. \n\nI\u2019d also talk to a housing attorney \u2014 some cities have tenant legal aid offices you can call, or look around for a free consult and ask if they have any advice on the best course of action. \n\nCheck your credit report too because the flag might be coming from that. I don\u2019t know if the late fees would hit collections separately from rent but it\u2019s possible. Also make sure your landlord hasn\u2019t filed an eviction notice. They send the late fee notices by mail so there could be a lot more your roommate is hiding. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough situation but it\u2019s not uncommon for roommates to pay one person. It\u2019s not advised because of things like this, but I think some people are being a little harsh in this thread. You just never hear about the stories where everything goes fine so try not to beat yourself up too much.",

    "postText": "Hi all. Wife and I are looking to purchase a house in 2 years. Don't know whether to reduce retirement savings to apply towards down payment, or just keep on the same pace. Here is our current rundown:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||Salary + Bonus (Gross)|401k (per mo)|Roth IRA (per mo)|HSA (per mo)|Pension (per mo)|Retirement Value|Stocks|Savings|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Me (28)|$106k|$1900\\*|$542|$580\\*\\*|x|$76k|$56k|x|\n|Wife (25)|$60k|x|$542|x|$610|$15k|\\~$50k|x|\n|Total|$166k|$1900|$1084|$580|$610|$91k|$106k|$70k|\n\n\\*Includes max 4% contribution, 4% match, and \\~10% profit sharing\n\n\\*\\*Includes \\~$80 company contribution\n\nNo debt. Currently renting for about $2000/mo and other expenses total \\~$1800/mo. Able to save \\~$4k/mo. Plan is to have my wife be a SAHM when we have a house in a few years so we will be on one income. Wanting to pay a 15yr mortgage amount in a 30yr and houses in our area (Atlanta) around the $450k-$500k mark. Plan on putting down $200k which will leave us with $75k including our E fund and a max $3200/mo mortgage (including taxes and insurance) which is quite a stretch in my mind.\n\nI would absolutely love to spend 400k-450k on a home in a few years depending on the market, but the $3200/mo 15yr mortgage is me planning for the worst case. My salary + bonus will continue to rise by let's say a minimum 5% per year (Civil Engineer). \n\nTL;DR: Since we will be on one income for a few years, is it worth reducing the amount put into the IRA or HSA to save towards a larger down payment, or just keep saving how we're saving?",

    "postText": "[Some good news](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/business/irs-phone-scams-jeff-sessions.html) for those who have experienced this scam or know people who have been duped by the same: \n\n&gt;With stiff sentences for 21 conspirators last week in the United States and a round of indictments in India, the Justice Department says it has broken up what appeared to be the nation\u2019s first large-scale, multinational telephone fraud operation.\n\n&gt;Over four years, more than 15,000 victims in the United States lost \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars to the sophisticated scam, and more than 50,000 individuals had their personal information misused, the department said Friday. The money was routed through call centers in India back to the ringleaders in eight states.\n\n&gt;The fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. A person posing as an Internal Revenue Service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.\n\n&gt;In an announcement on Friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states \u2014 Illinois, Arizona, Florida, California, Alabama, New Jersey and Texas \u2014 were sentenced last week in Houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.\n\n&gt;In addition, 32 contractors in India involving five call centers in Ahmedabad, a city in western India, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.\n\nAs always, remain vigilant about supposed IRS claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the IRS. The IRS never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. Communication always begins over snail mail. Hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations. ",

It's an automated message created with a Text To Speech system.  They give a number to call them back at.  In the last week they've all been 401 numbers (Rhode Island).  If you call them, you can tell it's just another group in India running a similar scam.",

So, I'm guessing there's a good chance 100% of social security numbers have been irrevocably compromised and are out there for sale. \n\nWhat I don't get is, why don't we as a country move away from using SSNs and such as a system to verify identity?  Using a 9-digit code to identify people in this way and leaning on it for credit and such is just a really bad idea that's been demonstrably flawed for well over a decade now.  ",

I've been getting daily spoofed phone calls that often leave automated voice messages in Mandarin for about a year now despite me being pretty discreet with my cell number. So much so that anytime I get a fraud protection call from my CU, I call them back and make sure everything is legitimate, instead of just calling back the number the robot provides and giving away my PIN/DOB/Account number. It's a little bit more of a hassle, but you can't really trust that it is actually your bank/credit union that made the initial call in the first place.\n\nI also got a couple of calls \"from the IRS\" in the past saying that I owe money and even have multiple arrest warrants *(I don't lol)*. \n\nA couple years back there was a woman that called from a US number with a thick Indian/Pakistani accent *(she said her name was something like Maria Martinez)* and told me that there's a warrant for my arrest for money owed to the IRS and that there have been a couple of attempts by the police to arrest me at my house. The really interesting and spooky part was that she actually had my correct address, which again, I don't make a habit of plastering all over on top of having my full name and address. I told her that she can send as many cops to my house as she wants, then asked her to go fuck herself and then called the local sherrif's office to report the issue and the number. They were aware of it. The hoardes of cops never came lol.\n\n**Moral of the story, I guess is don't give out your number/private info unless you either trust the company or are willing to inevitably get your information leaked.** Don't give away any info to any retailer, because that's the most likely place where it'll get leaked. Don't give any real info to your local pharmacy, your grocery store or a shoe store, because it will get out *(or more than likely sold)*.\n\n",

But the main thing you get from doing a PhD isn't specific knowledge in specific tasks, but a scientific, research focused mindset that generalizes very well to other occupations, not just science.  Also, Ben Carson is an accomplished neurosurgeon and medical doctor, but he does not have a PhD.\n\nBut your main point is right.  Advanced degrees are highly specialized and don't necessarily give you wisdom regarding the world.",

She told her boss, who teased her a little, then gave her a hug and told her not to feel bad. Because an old student of his, someone getting their MD also fell for it. Wound up fucking up that kid's life. He couldn't pay for his apt and dropped out of med school. All because he was ashamed to tell anyone. Brilliant kid, but got scared into submission, and his life was irrevocably altered.\n\nLesson I learned. Those scams can work even on people you think they would never work on.

I don't and didn't). They told me they were located in Pakistan. That that were attempting to scam people out of money because they knew some were stupid enough to do it (exact words were \"Americans are stupid and will send us money\").  It was honestly shocking how open this person was. \n\nThings did take a turn though when they asked me if I was currently in NC (I was), I informed that I was. They then asked if this was my him address. I told them no. That I am sure they did a reverse number search on me, but that wasn't my address (it was not). They then informed me, in the most hilarious way, that an airplane was being sent to my house to \"blow me up\". Needless to say I had a good laugh about this (though tbf this isn't that funny considering). \n\nIt was an illuminating conversation to say the least.

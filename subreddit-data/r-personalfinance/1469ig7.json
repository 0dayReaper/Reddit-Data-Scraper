    "postText": "I recently got a term life insurance policy. Obviously my wife is the primary beneficiary. The secondary beneficiaries are my children. However, they are minors, so the money would actually go to the people whom we\u2019ve specified in our wills as their guardians. Not that I don\u2019t trust they would use the money on my children, but is there a way to structure it so that the money would go somewhere (e.g., an account) that my children could access when they turn 18?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "First congratulations on getting a life insurance policy.  This proceeds may help support the family if you pass.  This is an important part of family protection that many people overlook.\n\nYou can use a Uniform Trust to Minors Act (UTMA) account.  You would need to designate an adult custodian.  Being a custodian means that they are responsible for managing the money and disbursing the money for the benefit of the minor (your kids).\n\nOnce your kids turns the age of majority (18-21, depending on the state), the UTMA would dissolve.  The custodian's authority ends, and the kids would gain full control of the assets.\n\nSetting up an UTMA designation is common and doesn't cost anything.  Most insurance firms have boilerplate language to facilitate this.\n\nThat being said, many parents believe that age 18-21 may be too young for their children to have authority over a large sum of money.  So parents sometimes set up trust, to put further restrictions on access/authority.  This is where an estate attorney would come in.",

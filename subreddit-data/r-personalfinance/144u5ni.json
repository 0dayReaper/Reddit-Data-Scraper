    "postText": "It\u2019s called the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)- basically, you get back the first $2,000 in full, and 25% of the next $2,000. So if you spend $4,000 or more, you get back $2,500. \n\nThat $4,000 can be tuition, books, supplies, etc. \n\nThe AOTC credit can be claimed for up to 4 years (amend your taxes for any recent years you qualified and didn\u2019t claim it). \nAfter 4 years, the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) can be claimed for as many more years as you attend school. \n\nThey both are worth the same, but the difference is the AOTC is refundable and the LLC is not. That means with the AOTC if you would have gotten $100 back in taxes, you would get $2,600 back instead. If you would have owed $100, you\u2019d get $2,400 back instead. The LLC is not refundable, but it reduces any tax you owe. So if you would have owed $2,000 then you would owe $0 but still get nothing back. If you would have gotten $200 back, you still just get $200. \n\nHere is a link to the IRS website about the AOTC: https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/aotc\n\nThere is a link at the bottom that explains the Lifetime Learning Credit.",

The credit is applied towards your $2200 liability, meaning you owe $200. However, since you paid $2400, you overpaid your taxes by $2200, so you would get $2200 back.\n\nEDIT: For clarity, this is regarding the Lifetime Learning Credit.",

You do not have to pay out of pocket to claim the AOC/education credits.\n\nI did taxes for a number of years and can link the IRS guidance on this if anyone wants it, but you can still claim the credits and SHOULD claim them even if you have student loans for your tuition. \n\nThe only thing you can't claim is scholarships/grant money (these amounts are reported on Form 1098-T). You need to reduce the qualified tuition by the amounts rec'd for scholarships/grants when claiming the credit.\n\nMaximum credit per year is $2,500 (of which $1,000 is a REFUNDABLE credit). So there are limitations if you do not have enough earned income/tax liability (you may not be able to get the full $2,500 refunded in those cases).",

So I should elect to have less money taken out so that I \"owe\" taxes but get the LLC (and have more money each check for savings)?",

    "postText": "Hey y'all, I have a used 2019 Honda Civic Sport under a car loan with Santander USA. I was going to refinance my car this month but there was a recent hail storm that damaged my car. My current APR is 8.39%, term being 60 months. I have no idea if I'm allowed to even refinance with this damage (it's all over my car, the damage is roughly 6k in damages). I was told by my car insurance that I will be getting a check soon so if I decide to repair it or put it towards my car balance. This is my first car, and also my first time financing a car so I would greatly appreciate some insight on if I can still even refinance or just forget about that and put the money towards the principal to pay it off sooner.

    "postText": "This one is a bit complicated and it seems like my mortgage company has really no clue how to handle it. I bought a house with my then significant other a few years back. We were both co signers on the mortgage and were considered co-owners. We were not married at the time and never got married. A year or two after buying the house he moved out. The home was not refinanced or modified at that time so he remained on the loan and the house deed (I realize now this was a big mistake). He eventually married someone else shortly after this and they filed a joint chapter 7 bankruptcy together. He didn\u2019t reaffirm the home and surrendered the property in his bankruptcy filing. On some parts of the bankruptcy filing he listed me as a co owner but other parts checked boxes that made it appear as if he and new wife/co filer were the owners of the property. The bankruptcy was finalized in December. \n\nHere\u2019s where it gets even more confusing. He\u2019s still listed on all the housing documents. Property taxes, insurance, home loan, county deed, etc. I can\u2019t do anything with my loan until I get him off these accounts because his signature is still required. He is basically refusing to cooperate and saying that he filed his bankruptcy which is public record and if they have any questions they can refer to that. My loan servicer gives me different answers every time I call them. They have the info from his bankruptcy and say they can\u2019t collect any money from him. But he\u2019s also still listed as a co owner on the house, meaning I need his signature to do anything and technically is still co owner of the home in their eyes, even though he discharged his part of the loan in the bankruptcy. They have told me I need him to file a \u201cquit claim deed\u201d with the local County Recorder, but he has refused to do that saying, \u201cthat\u2019s all in the bankruptcy\u201d. \n\nHere\u2019s some of my questions. I will add I haven\u2019t been contacted by a trustee at this time. Could the bankruptcy trustee eventually come after the home and force a sale? Does the trustee co-own the home with me? How do I get him off the home loan and other accounts if he\u2019s refusing to cooperate or submit documents.",

I was hoping to get some more insight here too if possible before reaching out to an attorney. You never know if someone had a similar situation, and questions here are free. I knew nothing about any of this 5 days ago. My plan was to be well prepared with as many good questions as possible when I go into that meeting with an attorney. Thank you for your help as well.",

            "comment": "Generally to get him off the loan you would need to refinance on your own. Biggest negative to this is you have to pay fees and you would also lose your current rate (assuming it\u2019s lower and fixed then current rates). That part is fairly straight forward except how it is effected by his bankruptcy, that is lawyer territory. He doesn\u2019t just get to say \u201cbankruptcy\u201d and ignore this issue, but if he also has little incentive to cooperate except that he may get a chunk of money if you refinance as he owns half the equity, again no idea how the bankruptcy effects is equity.\n\nMy guess would be that the bankruptcy trust (if that\u2019s a thing) would get his half ownership and thus you would need to get the house appraised, refinance, and give the trust the ex\u2019s equity, or sell the house and give them the equity.",

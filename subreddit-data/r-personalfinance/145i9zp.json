    "postText": "Okay, I'll try to keep this short but give as much info as possible. My brother just called me, he lives in South Carolina. He asked me about some loan stuff with banks and then asked me if 500% interest was normal. I have never seen a loan with 500% interest. His credit score was in the 600s when he got the loan. The original loan amount was for $1900 and he has paid over 6k to them so far, $400 payments every 2 weeks. Less than $50 has gone to principle. He got the loan through Credit Karma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have some screenshots he sent me of his loan agreement and payments through their app. The LA looks super fishy, definitely doesn't look like loan agreements I have had in the past. If I can post the screens in a comment, then I can do an imgur link. Not sure if that's allowed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company is listed as: \n\nAWL II, Inc. \n\n3910 W. 6th Ave, Box 277 \n\nStillwater, OK, 74074.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what to do or what to tell him. A loan like this seems predatory. Can he report this to someone? Or do anything about it, besides paying if off in one fell swoop, which he said they wouldn't let him do or said he couldn't do that right now. Any info would be appreciated. We are kinda in a panic over this. He admitted to me that he wasn't keeping track of stuff bc it was all autopay. And now we are wondering if he can do anything about it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit/Update: So far we have determined that it is a tribal loan, and that the AWL company is a native american owned business that offers payday loans at extremely high interest rates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother has contacted his bank and cancelled future payments. We are going to sit and wait to see if they try to collect the other $4k that the agreement says he owes. If they do then we will ask them to show proof of debt and go from there. If they prove or we otherwise can't figure a way out then we will just pay off the balance and then we will see what can be done about the $6k in payments he has already made. He found his whole loan agreement and as far as he can tell there isn't a penalty for early payoff. But he wants me to read over it to make sure. He has filed a complaint with the CFPB, not expecting it to go anywhere but will update here just in case someone else finds this and can use the info. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to everyone who offered advice and information. Very much appreciated. We had no idea where to even start. I will still be reading comments so if there is anything that anyone else can share it would still be appreciated. The more we know, the better.",

He was browsing around on his CK app, saw a quick loan that he could get to buy the kids more gifts. And figuring he could afford it, tapped on the offer and ended up on the AWL site applying for a tribal loan.\n\nHe gets the $1,900, buys the gifts and sets the payments to autopay. Figuring it will be paid off in a couple of months. Fast forward, life is busy, he's neglecting his finances. When he realizes he is falling behind he sets aside a day to work on the bills. Has a hey wtf is this $410 charge every two weeks moment. Looks at the app that he used to set up the auto payments. Calls me and sends me screenshots.\n\nYes, he does make enough money to afford these payments, thankfully. But the reason it wasn't an immediate red flag is because they have other debts that they are paying down and sometimes they don't stay up to the minute on every account. We all get distracted and life happens. They got a system and it works for them. \n\nWe could have paid it off for him, he could have paid it off himself. But he didn't realize that he was still paying on that $1900 loan. And he was already out 6k. We had no idea if it was a scam, computer error, or what. But we got it figured out now mostly. Hope that helps clarify.",

They're subject to Federal Law when intersecting with regular US consumers but there's no Federal cap on interest rates, payday loans are regulated at the state level which has no authority over the tribes.\n\nThat said, the rate on a payday loan is legal in 36 states. They're a separate category of financing and the intent is that the loan is paid-in-full plus the fee on your next pay day. Most get around literal interest rate caps by essentially re-originating the payday loan every two weeks and charging a fixed fee that works out to something like 500% interest +/-.\n\nHe needs to pay this off immediately.",

Call your brother\u2019s bank, ask them to block future payments from this company. It might cost like $35-$50 to do but it\u2019s better than $800/month. Shortly after he should start receiving emails or phone calls, there he can speak to a representative and either work out a plan and/or refuse to pay. Idk exactly what my brother said, but he explained that he has more than repaid the loan and he isn\u2019t going to be paying anymore. They closed his account and we haven\u2019t heard from them since, thank God. He\u2019s out the $4k but you can make it stop.",

That said, they won't always do the smart thing, plenty of people have collected in lawsuits for FDCPA violations.  Violations in attempting to collect on an illegal loan entitles you to $1000 per attempt AFAIK.  Definitely reach out to a lawyer on that one once the calls start happening.

Gonna have to look into this one, lol\n\nAlso, no, it isn't going over my head that I'm calling them shitbags while literally describing a pretty scummy plan implying I myself may be a shitbag...but I would argue that their shittiness kinda justifies being shitty to them...or atleast it does when I couple it with tens of thousands of dollars in free money!!

You may be charged a sky-high interest rate \"***\n\nBecause of disagreements about regulation, tribal loans can be more expensive than payday loans. The CFPB says it\u2019s common for payday lenders to charge a $15 fee for a $100 loan. That works out to the equivalent of an almost 400% interest rate for a two-week loan.\n\nBut costs for tribal loans could be even higher. In a 2017 lawsuit brought against four tribal lenders, which was later withdrawn, the CFPB said the annual percentage rates for the tribes\u2019 installment loan products worked out to between 440% and 950%. According to the lawsuit, the CFPB alleged that the typical $800 loan paid over 10 months would end up costing the borrower $3,320.\n\nSome tribal lenders in certain jurisdictions are currently charging an annual percentage rate of nearly 800% APR.",

On the loan agreement you linked it clearly states what the total cost of the loan would be. He should be more careful and read the agreements when he signs. \n\nI had a family member who fell into something similar, I helped them pay it off immediately because they had already paid more than the principal by the time I found out. If he's not sure about money stuff he should ask for help understanding how this stuff works.",

In your brother loan agreement it should state the consequences if you default on the loan. For me it was they would get a lawyer but never stated to go to collections and effect my credit they could sell the debt to a collector but this type of lending is illegal in my state so I'm going to find out. I was doing my research saw that AWL as well as WithU loans are in lawsuits for this exact reason of predatory lending. It is said that the SEC decided to have Withu cease and desist business practices and that Withu and AWL are not legitimate tribal lenders since they lack the tribal licensing. My guess is that they are hiding under the tribal companies to charge high interest rates but are ran by American people. Look up the lawsuit with AWL it should shed some light and maybe help your brother out. Since they can't report it to collections then I guess they can't get their money. So I refuse to pay it and who's going to court when they already be losing lawsuits?\n\nBut please do your own research don't take my word for it look for yourself. Search out AWL. Also I'm sorry your brother went through that",

She, at that point, was both: metastases to her brain were proven. \n\nThe ability of organizations like this to prey on the most vulnerable is appalling.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a 26F who currently pays $1330 in rent and total bills are $1650 a month. I make $3700 a month post tax. I have a side hustle and can make upwards of $1k a month but it\u2019s not stable. $30k in savings, 20k in retirement, no CC debt and 8k in student loans. I have no car payment but I\u2019m coming up on 9 years with my Honda accord. \n\nIm currently in nursing school and set to graduate and start working as a new nurse in October. I accepted an offer but don\u2019t have salary details yet. \n\nIm looking into buying a home. A new build at $255k (the cheapest one). I was approved for FHA but the rate is 6.5% which puts the mortgage at $2,305. I assume my new nurse salary will be similar to what I make now, but hoping for salary growth opportunities. \n\nMy lease will end after graduation and though I don\u2019t mind my apartment, I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of in-unit issues and awful neighbors. I\u2019m getting a little tired of renting and would love to be in my own home. Given that the mortgage is at least more than half of my take home pay now, would it ever make sense to do this? I keep being told that the rates will never go back down and home prices will keep going up. \n\nI am expecting to get a 10k sign on bonus, and considered dividing this by 12 and paying house stuff first, and paying the rest with my salary for the first year.This would be about $1500 that I would pay from the nursing pay into the house. \n\nOf course I can get a roommate, but I know i shouldn\u2019t rely on that. \n\nIn my area, a lot of homes are older and at least $250k but in less desirable areas. Being that I\u2019m a single woman, it\u2019s important for me to feel like I live in a safer area. Townhomes in the area were built in the 80s, priced around $200k but the HOA fee brings the estimated mortgage amounts to around $1900. Everything I\u2019ve looked at seems to need a lot of work. \n\nSorry if this is a lot of info, I\u2019m just at a loss  on what to do and eager to own a home. I understand homeownership comes with a lot of unexpected expenses. I do not know what my rent price will be if I resign my lease yet. I wouldn\u2019t mind resigning but I know I will have to go through this process at some point.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to keep renting and saving until Im a little more stable. Thanks for the responses",

People don\u2019t realize until you buy a house - owning a house costs *more* than the mortgage payment! You are responsible for the costs of everything house related and they add up very quickly!

It would usually take 7-10 years to come out ahead on a home vs renting - do you think you'd stay in a home that long?

You'll have also paid 78,000 in interest, plus whatever is being set aside for tax, insurance and PMI escrows.\n\nYou've effectively paid $1300 a month in rent (78k/60 months) while putting $388/month into savings in the form of equity in the house. Again still not including taxes, insurance and PMI.\n\nIf the house appreciates 3% per year the house will be worth $295,000 making your gross equity will be about $67k.\n\nThe challenge here is that you're equity will be all tied up in the original house.\n\nThat $67k doesn't help you secure a new home. At 22% you'd have just barely enough to qualify for a second-home/investment-property cash-out refinance... Actually at that point you'd basically be better off doing nothing unless you can get a substantial reduction in your interest rate (unlikely with a second home, though dropping PMI will save you several hundred dollars or more a year too) since the 2% you would get back will go to closing costs (though a lender may require you to refinance before they'll qualify you for a new \"primary home\" loan). You'd basically be refinancing to drop PMI, possibly lower interest, lower your Debt-to-Income (you're extending the loan by 5 more years so your payment will drop) and address the fact a mortgage company is likely to be skeptical underwriting a new primary home loan while you still have an FHA Primary Loan mortgage out on the first house.\n\nAssuming you dont save any other money during this period, you'd have about the same savings to buy the more expensive second home that you did to buy the first one. 30k - 7.5k down payment - 7.5k closing costs = $15k remaining in savings. 15k at 4% growth for 5 years is going to be $18,250.  Its actually worse than it appears though because as a percentage of the home value, its actually going to be less. If you're \"stepping up\" from your $255k home, you need to also factor in the appreciation on the more expensive home.. As we said your $255k home will be $295k. The $295k stepped up home will now be 342k assuming it appreciates at the same rate as your $255k home. So where you're entering into the first home with 6% going into the purchase between downpayment and closing costs, you'd be going into the second home with 5.33%.\n\nYou'd be trading one house-poor situation for being double-house poor.\n\nAnd again this is all before considering pmi, insurance and taxes which clearly increase your costs by a not insubstantial amount ($740/mo or about $9k/yr).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith this understanding, look at the other option:\n\nSave the 30k you currently have.\n\nSave the $388 per month you'd be paying towards principal each month\n\nPay the $1300/month you'd be paying towards interest each month towards rent.\n\nSave the lets say $600 per month you'd be paying towards PMI and taxes (we'll assume a renters insurance policy is $140 a month).\n\nIn 5 years time with 4% growth you'll have $102,000 to go buy that $350k home.\n\nHeck even saying you put that money into savings at 3% growth, just so it grows at the same rate as your home, you end up at $98k. All liquid and available to purchase the \"next\" home.\n\nLong term, having additional properties and making yourself house-poor in your \"forever home\" to acquire or keep them might make sense since its a strong passive-earnings source but in the short-term and with the present state of your finances as well as plans not to stay in the home, it doesn't make sense to tie up that much equity in a house-poor situation.\n\nNow if you could find something cheaper that you maybe want to flip or rent in 5 years, that's a much different story.",

If you're thinking you will move in a few years anyway, those are still going to be concerns.\n\nSo you'd be better off renting and saving money in the meantime. Yes, if you buy you'll get equity - but if you can rent at $1330/month or buy at $2300/month, you will be much better off saving that $1000 difference than you would be from the couple hundred dollars going towards equity. The house might give some appreciation, but it will also give maintenance expenses.\n\nContinue renting. Live like you would if you were house poor, and save the rest. Then choose somewhere you want to live long term, and use what you've saved to put a downpayment on that. If you can save that $1000/month difference between your rent and estimated mortgage, in a couple years that's $24,000 you'll have towards the downpayment.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m only going to comment on your income potential as a nurse because that\u2019s where I have the most experience, being an RN myself. Firstly, just general advice, don\u2019t accept a position without knowing the pay rate. \n\nSecondly, DO NOT TAKE THE SIGN ON BONUS. Idk the details of yours but if it\u2019s like my hospital\u2019s (and I suspect it is as many of them are structured similarly) it is a trap, straight up. Ours is basically a loan for 3 years of your time. If you leave before that 3 years is up, then you owe them that $10K plus interest back. The other catch is that it\u2019s taxed, but not until those 3 years are up, so in 3 years time Uncle Sam is coming for his, and he\u2019s coming for a pretty decent sized chunk of it. I don\u2019t remember the exact number but HR told me I\u2019d get to keep just over half of it, so only plan to only use half that money if you\u2019re going to use it (safely) off the bat, someone else may be able to give you more specifics on how the taxation on that will work. Now if you plan on staying for the amount of time specified and you\u2019re not gonna touch it until that time is up, go for it, otherwise, I always tell new hires to avoid it. Your bonus may be structured differently with your hospital, but I promise you no matter what, you\u2019re not taking it all home, you will owe taxes on it. \n\nNow full pay transparency here for you. Fair warning, take this with a grain of salt, my math may be off, but I think it\u2019s ok. I\u2019ve been an RN in a 50 bed ICU for 2 years, I have not gotten a raise so this has been the same pay since I started. I make $37.05hour; $27.80 is base pay, $6.25 is night diff, and $3 is critical care diff. My base pay gets me $2,390.80 gross per pay period (84 hours/2 weeks, 80 regular hours, 4 OT hours, paid biweekly). Assuming you\u2019re working days with no other diffs, and your base is the same as mine, you\u2019re gross would be $4,781.60/month or $57,379.20/year. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a safe guess-timate as to where you\u2019ll start out. After you tax that yearly income you\u2019re left with $49,138.78 or $4,094.89 a month. Not too shabby, I\u2019d say, but keep in mind it could be less depending on your base pay rate, it could also be more. My advice would be to work nights if you can stand it, my night diff gets me an extra $13k gross a year, not an insignificant amount. Most places it will get you anywhere from $7k-$15k extra a year. \n\nEven more significantly, if you don\u2019t already, move somewhere where nurses have a union. I unfortunately work in the US in a state without a nurses union. My hospital and many others in the state have not given a raise to their nurses in a decade or more (you get a raise by jumping from hospital to hospital, getting small raises with each jump) we get treated like the lowest man on the totem pole, and our concerns and suggestions constantly fall on deaf ears. Do yourself a favor, go somewhere with a union, it\u2019s worth it. People make the joke that nurses are only rewarded with with pizza parties, but that shit is real, and they\u2019ll make you pay for the pizza. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to answer your actual question, but I hope I was able to offer some insight into what your income may look like as a nurse. Good luck to you, get some experience under your belt and then go travel nurse, that\u2019s where the money is.",

Do not rely on that for income. They don\u2019t tell you this when you sign the contract of course. Experienced nurses get bonuses in a similar way, usually part after signing or after working 30 days and part after 3-6 months. These bonuses are also taxed all to hell. You\u2019ll probably get about 3.5k every 6 months. \n\nDon\u2019t buy a house right now. It\u2019s absolutely not worth it. If you ever want to travel nurse you\u2019ll be tied down by your home. You should absolutely wait a good while, especially after starting a new career, and even more especially after starting working as a nurse. \n\nWorking as a new grad nurse is not fun. It is extremely stressful. And the fact that you\u2019re getting a 10k sign on bonus as a new grad is a huge red flag in the nursing world. It means they can\u2019t get anyone to come work for them unless they give a big ol bonus. Do not add any extra stress (like buying/ building a home,) on top of being a new nurse.

I would never recommend letting your mortgage be more than 35% of your total post-tax household income at the absolute top end (unless you\u2019re very wealthy maybe). \n\nYou WILL run into issue after issue at least once a year. Even when it\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s always SOMETHING. That is the nature of homeownership. Appliances break, you start a project and find a shitty/problematic DIY from a previous owner or shoddy workmanship from the builder, house settles incorrectly, foundation issues, small leak causes water damage, natural disaster, the list goes on. You need to save minimum 1% of your home value year over year to keep up in most cases, which seems easy. But in a $255k house, that\u2019s at least $210 per month for home repairs. So that puts you over $2500/mo on a $3700/mo salary. You would kick yourself in a few months for buying it. \n\nWait until you\u2019re actually making more or plan to become a landlord to help with the mortgage.

Interest rates are higher than they've been in a long time, as are home prices. There's no point in straining the chain and reducing your ability to exercise different options and be maneuverable just for the prestige or whatever from owning a home. We have all been sold that it's some kind of end all be all. A sign that you're a successful adult living the dream. In a lot of cases that home you own can be an anchor that locks you in place. If you're planting roots and raising a family I understand the desire to want to do that - maybe you like the school district or something and don't want to be at the mercy of a landlord. But if it's just wanting to own a home to say you're a homeowner I view that as the wrong reason. Do it if it's advancing your goals, not as the goal itself. Just my take.",

Learning the unit, and depending on your shifts etc you may not want to have to deal with the hassles of home ownership.  Also you should have been quoted some sort of salary with your job offer - and depending on how they hire and what your current job entails it may be similar/more/less depending.  You indicate you have a side hustle, so this may offset some of the income differences.  You may just be better off renting for at least another year to make sure that this unit is all that you want it to be.  \n\nI agree with whomever stated to not take that bonus, that bonus locks you into that hospital for a certain number of years and while the other poster said not to do it due to salary, my 2 cc here is you are a new grad, you dont know the culture of that unit (unless you are already a tech on that unit i suppose) and what if the unit culture does not jive with your personality -- you would have to repay the entire bonus if you left before that time frame is up. If I didnt already have a house when i graduated I dont know that I would have actually bought a house around graduation.

That's going to be one specific bottom of the barrel combination which may only be allowed on one single minimum-sized lot which was probably already sold before it ever opened to the public. Plus there will be buy-up options you will end up essentially needing if you want the house to be livable. Assume whatever you would actually buy is at least 30~40% more expensive than whatever price is listed as the cheapest.\n\nSecond, your utility cost is going to go up more than you think it is. I budgeted for ~2x when we moved the two of us from a 2br apartment to a 3br house in a similar area, and it actually went up by about 3x.\n\nAnd then of course as everyone else mentions - you will need to fix stuff. Probably ~1% of the value of the house per year. Even brand new - manufacturers fuck stuff up. Pest infestations happen. Can you afford an extra $2500 a year in random miscellaneous nonsense on top of everything else and not be actively draining your emergency savings?\n\nOur household income is around double yours, our mortgage is $1800 including taxes and insurance and we feel constantly house poor. Haven't been able to finish buying furniture and it's been 2.5 years. We've had some things you won't have to deal with like a $15k roof replacement and washer/dryer replacements, but all of those things for you will be bundled in to the purchase price which, as previously mentioned is probably going to be a lot higher than you're imagining right now.",

I was a year into my first job as an engineer, making ok money, but had a small inheritance from my grandfather dying. My family didn't think it was a good idea for me to buy a house, as I was a single female, would need a roommate, and would be at the top of my budget. But I did it anyways. I was really house rich money poor the first 2 years. It was an older 1930s home that needed additional work, I got roommates, and probably spent more time learning how to fix things and cook and clean  to save money than some do in their early 20s. But it has really paid off now. I found and married a wonderful man. The house works for our family, we now make more than enough for the mortgage. And the house has more than double in value. No one knows where the market and economy will go, but I am glad I put in the hard work then to enjoy the benefits now. Best of luck in your decision!",

You may quickly come to hate your new hospital/job.  You may decide to get some more schooling.  In both the above you may need to move.  And if we have a recession those rates might just come down while your job likely will be secure.  I'm putting off work on my home betting a recession will make it cheaper.  Same logic in applying for a new home.  In the meantime to get a feel for things you could find a community garden and see what that part of home ownership is like.  Find an elderly person in a home and volunteer to mow, garden etc.  Ask them about costs of maintenance.  Maybe you have parents or grandparents for this and if so talk to them.  Home ownership (even with a new home) can be expensive so I wouldn't want to start that house poor.  I bought my first, with my first job, and had to leave that job.  I found temp work out of town and was so lucky to find a great roommate and with me gone it worked well for both of us.

I had a friend who wanted to buy a house in Boise around 2014. He was earning enough to buy around $150k, which didn't buy much in the neighborhoods he wanted to be in at the time.  Well, a house came up in a great neighborhood for $200k, and we have him the bead on it. He didn't make a move on it because he didn't want to be house poor, so he didn't buy.  \n\nBut since 2014 house prices in Boise continued to rise, so even as he started making more money, houses were just out of his reach. And now to this day he still rents, even though he makes enough for a $350k house.\n\nBy the way, that $200k house he could have bought is worth $650k today.  And he could have refinanced that mortgage in 2021 to 2.85% and he'd be paying much less than the rent he pays today.\n\nSometimes you should stretch, because the opportunity is that good or because you will eventually make more money (or have a partner to help offset the cost).  \n\nBut sometimes you shouldn't, because maybe your life or job or the housing market is just in a volatile place.",

Builders are notorious for underfunding the HOA because people would never buy the houses if they charged what they actually need to. Once the builder is done building and the residents take over the HOA, they\u2019ll find out they\u2019re underfunded and have to raise dues.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the single family dues aren\u2019t bad, but about a third of the homes are townhomes, which pay different dues since the HOA is responsible for the roofs, building maintenance, etc of those townhomes. Those dues DOUBLED a couple years after the builder left because the reserves and maintenance plans were under funded by about $1M. At this point an 1800 sqft townhome in my neighborhood costs the same as a 3200 sqft single family home with a 2 car garage once you factor in the mortgage, insurance and the dues.",

As well, you definitely shouldn't lock yourself in to monthly payments that exceed 50% of your income. \n\nMy recommendation: wait until your new job starts and settle in a bit before making any big moves. In the mean time, either go month to month on renting or move in with your family if possible so that you can easily move into a new home when the time is right without worrying about a 12 mo lease. Save as much as possible in the meantime. Cut expenses as much as you can. You need more than just downpayment money for a house. There are closing costs (typically 4% of the purchase price) as well as moving costs, furniture, and other incidentals. Try to have more money than you need when you go into it for peace of mind. \n\nI do think it's smart to go new construction and $250k is a reasonable price range for a first time home buyer. New construction should hopefully limit the number of emergencies that pop up in regards to home maintenance.",

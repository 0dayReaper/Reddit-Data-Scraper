Credit score is high 700s/low 800s depending on what bureau/scoring model.  Good deal or keep shopping?",

Might want to check a CU to see if they can\u2019t get you better closing costs. Everyone else we looked at had closing costs at $10-$15k which is still lower that why you are hearing for your loan so I would shop around.\n\nEdit to add that closing costs could and likely will be higher on a cash out refi than a straight out purchase like we did but I think you are still way high",

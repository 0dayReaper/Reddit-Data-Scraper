    "postText": "My wife (38) had a stroke that left her with no motor function. She will require care for the rest of her life. We have two little girls. 11 and 8. I need advice on how to protect the estate if anything were to happen to me. I don't want her ongoing care to drain the estate if I'm gone. I also need to set up protection for our kids. I have so many questions about long term disability, social security, etc. I'm overwhelmed and don't know where to begin. \n\nEdit #1 I am meeting with a social worker this afternoon. UPDATE: Social worker was amazing and she says the kids are doing very well and to keep doing what I'm doing. The kids like her and I'll continue to have her check in on them.\n\nEdit #2 My wife has a school loan. Can I get this absolved?\n\nEdit #3 My wife is a RN making $65k/year. I've contacted her manager about her last paycheck and cashing out her PTO. \n\nEdit #4 WOW amazing response. As you can imagine, I have a lot going on right now. I plan to read through these comments this evening. \n\nEdit #5 Well, I've had even less time than expected to read everything. I've been able to skim through and I'm feeling like I have a direction now and a lot of good information to reference along the way. \n\nEdit #6 UPDATE: She is living with her retired parents now and going to outpatient rehab 3 days a week. She is making progress towards recovery, but at this point she still needs more attention than I can provide her. The kids and I travel the 2.5 hour drive every weekend to be with her. I believe that she will eventually be well enough to come home, but I don't know when that will be. Could be a few months, or it could be a few years. \nRecently, she has begun to eat more food orally and I think we are on a path to remove her feeding tube. She is also gaining strength vocally. She's hard to understand, but she says some words very well. A little strength is returning to her left side, but too soon to tell if it will continue. Her right side is very strong. She can stand with assistance.  Thanks to the Reddit community for your concern. I hope to continue posting positive updates. ",

You can also research \"taxable income on canceled or forgiven debt.\" \n\nETA: If you read further down the thread, evidently the new Republican tax bill is seeking to eliminate taxation on federal student loans that have been discharged due to disability after Dec 31, 2017 so might want to wait a bit to see if that provision passes.

There are many genetic disorders, some of which are dominant (50% chance of passing on to each kid). \n\nYour 2 little girls will most likely be on birth control at some point in their lives, which can exacerbate clotting disorders.\n\nWhile clotting disorders are not treated necessarily, it is good information to know, because risk factors like obesity and diabetes then become MUCH higher risks of strokes or heart attacks.\n\nAgain, OP, this is a terrible situation, but make sure you do your due diligence to make sure your children are not affected",

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but there may be much more yet to come.  Here's my own story.\n\nNearly three years ago, my 35 year old wife suffered a stroke one month after giving birth to our youngest son.  We did everything right -- got to the ER quickly, administered tPA in the right timeframe, got her across town to the world famous top-tier stroke treatment hospital, into surgery, and 97% of the clot was busted up.  Doctors were hopeful.  Everything looked great.  She was talking and moving immediately after surgery.\n\nThen they moved her to neuro ICU, and in the ~20 minutes it took to do the move she suffered several mini strokes along the way.  By the time i got to her room in the ICU, she had gone from speaking clearly to having aphasia, struggling with most words, and difficulty moving right arm.  Mere hours later, she had lost all words but \"yes\", \"no\", and \"uh\" and had no control of her right side.  While in the ICU, she kept spiking fevers and needed blood transfusions.  In the end, it took about a week to diagnose stage IV rectal cancer as the root cause of the stroke.\n\nWe moved her to the local world famous top-tier cancer treatment hospital a few neighborhoods away.  We had a team of doctors figure out a treatment protocol, but the stroke was a complication -- the best treatment for stroke recovery is to get into a boot camp-like in-patient intensive physical therapy program as quickly as possible, but the cancer treatment made that impossible.  At the same time, chemo needs the patient to have some strength to withstand the side effects, but the stroke made that difficult for my wife.  In the end, we tried some light chemo but the cancer was so advanced (metastasized to 80% of the liver and 100% of one kidney) there was nothing that could be done.  A week and a half later, she moved to hospice.  Three days after that, exactly 3 weeks from the stroke, and less than two months from the birth of our youngest boy, she passed away in her sleep.\n\nOP, I'm not saying that's going to happen to you, but you need to be prepared.  Things may get much, much worse.  Though in a sick and perverse way, my wife dying was better than if she had lived with the debilitating stroke effects.  In the end I only paid my family max out of pocket for the year ($6250, not all of which was for the stroke+cancer because the previously mentioned birth was a c-section) on a medical bill well over half a million.  Her student loan was fully discharged without counting as income.  Her life insurance will ensure our children can go to university wherever they like without having to worry about FAFSA or loans.  And our kids now get ~$1100/mo each from SSA, which I'm saving for them in custodial accounts, which could be well over half a million each by the time the benefits end.  My life as a widower is not great, but at least I didn't have time to build resentment over having to care for my invalid wife for years with no hope of anything getting better all the while draining our family's finances and impacting my own ability to work.\n\nA stroke at 38 in an otherwise healthy-appearing woman is not normal.  Unless there are obvious reasons, be prepared for more bad news.  If you get none, and the stroke is it, then count your blessings.\n\n(I did have my wife's tumor checked and no genetic markers were present.  Her 38 year old brother had a colonoscopy within a month of her death and will have to get them every other year or so for the rest of his life.  Our children will start getting colonoscopies in their 20s or 30s because of the family history, well before the currently recommended age 50.)",

Had she been in even average shape, she would have caught her cancer much, much sooner. She also pushed through her initial bout of symptoms because she always had minor aches and pains and fatigue due to her weight, and she didn't want to come off as a complainer.\n\nThere are some cancers that are truly completely asymptomatic, but they're pretty rare. So, sure, it's possible you secretly have terminal cancer that's completely 100% asymptomatic. But that's extremely, extremely unlikely. You're literally more likely to be crushed to death by your television than to be killed by magic asymptomatic cancer.\n\nJust stay healthy as much as you can, live your life, and try not to worry about all the what-ifs.

The good news is if you are young and keep a healthy diet/lifestyle, you'll most likely not get one. Even if you do get one, if you catch it early you'll most likely be fine after treatment. The key is not being stupid and ignoring pain or discomfort for too long. Get your regular check ups, even the uncomfortable ones.",

So then they went back through all the records, no one ever mentioned a lump, so they did a biopsy. Came back cancerous and she had both her thyroid removed and underwent chemo. It was really, really scary. And it makes me question whether over the counter birth control is really the best thing. My best friend is alive only because she had to go into the gyno to get it",

You are not a bad person or in any way \"wrong\" for feeling that way - momentarily or otherwise. When you remember what the person *used* to be like (or even worse, when the sick or injured person remembers), the every-day reality of something like this is rarely pleasant or rewarding. More often than not it's ugly, frustrating, embarrassing, and there isn't anything better on the horizon because it's only gets worse. It destroys relationships, and can leave the healthy/surviving family members with life-long emotional issues.\n\nI can't speak to what it's like caring/living with someone *born* with a serious disability - I'm sure that's different. And I can't even imagine having to deal with anything like this without financial means &amp; a strong network of extended family and friends. But I can confidently say that death isn't the worst thing that can happen to a loved one.\n\nOnce you're OK admitting these things to yourself and those you trust, I think it's easier to accept the hand you've been dealt. This isn't television - real life is messy and complicated. Your feelings aren't unjustified just because they don't sound particularly sentimental. Dispense with the guilt and anger (toward the sick/injured person and yourself) that you might not have even realized you were carrying with you every single waking moment. \n\nThis message brought to you by: years of therapy.  \n\n",

Doctors are great, but it can never hurt to get a second or even third opinion. If something feels wrong, there's a chance it might be seriously wrong. What's a couple hundred bucks extra in co-pays on the off chance you save your own life? \n\nNot a similar story, but a situation where listening to your body is important. I knew a guy who was incredibly fit. A 6 mile run was a warm up for him. One day he felt really winded about 3 miles in. He thought that was weird, so he went to the doctor. Fortunately, the doctor also thought it was odd given his level of physical activity so they did a lot of tests that some doctors might deem unnecessary. Boom, they found leukemia. Luckily, they caught it early enough and after his treatments he was able to return to his exercise routine and even play sports. ",

That means you need to treat 24,000 women in order for one more of them to have a stroke per year. \n\nA second meta-analysis found a conflicting finding where only some of the studies showed an association, which was fairly weak. \n\nA large Danish cohort study showed a relative risk of 1.6x or 1.75x the risk when taking different doses of oestrogen/progesterone, but again the actual absolute risk is very small.\n\n_That said_, the absolute risk is extremely low only when 1. the pills are fairly low dose, which is what most formulations should be nowadays for contraceptive purposes anyway, and 2. without additional risk factors - especially smoking and clotting disorders themselves - that enhance clotting, which can flip a low risk into a higher risk that outweighs the risks of pregnancy.  \n\nBut despite this, then there\u2019s the question of: is aspirin indicated? I\u2019d say this is highly dependent on the pre-test probability (i.e. how likely someone is to get a clot based on all aspects of their history), but the risk of bleeding and GI problems far outweighs the benefit in the healthy young woman who needs to take OCP. They\u2019re fantastic for things like heart attack prevention, but they do carry a 1.54x risk of things like brain bleeding, so have to be careful (I don\u2019t know what the absolute risk is, to be fair). \n\nSource: a paywalled info source for doctors called UpToDate. Specifically, the article is \u201cRisks and side effects associated with oestrogen-progestin contraceptives\u201d. ",

Zero risk factors, super fit, etc. He has a genetic mutation that is linked to increased risk of blood clots (Factor 2) and this seems to be literally the only thing that has shown up as abnormal in all of his testing (other than the stroke itself). At this point, everything typical has been ruled out and doctors basically shrug. We only known about the Factor 2 mutation because of 23 and Me testing. However, the science isn\u2019t there on a treatment for Factor 2 yet so he just takes a baby aspirin daily while we wait for the medical community to catch up.\n\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s still much that\u2019s unknown in medicine. Doctors were legit puzzled by my husband and kept pulling me aside to ask if he takes steroids (he\u2019s fit, but not THAT fit). From my research, the medical community has only started really understanding stroke within the last 20-25 years. If it\u2019s a ischemic stroke (clot), which is most common, they will looks for a hole in the heart, atrial fibrillation and Factor 5 genetic mutation. If it\u2019s not one of those, then they\u2019re stumped.\n\nPeople who have suffered a stroke have a 25-30% chance of having another stroke, with odds increasing 40% in the subsequent 5 years. I recite that now as it\u2019s always in the back of my mind. OP, get informed, but don\u2019t panic. You\u2019re smart to be thinking ahead, but try not to go to a dark place. A neuroscientist wrote a book about her stroke called My Stroke of Insight and it\u2019s interesting if you\u2019re up for it. The odds are that your life will not go back to how it was before the stroke, but it can be good in a new, different way. Hang in there, get informed and keep being smart. Best of luck.",

But just so you and your wife knows, it DOES get better.\n\nThe first few months were hard,as I was unable to stay upright for too long, and I almost fell on every step, not to mention the dizziness and lack of function on my arm/hand/leg. With therapy and exercises it got better.\n\nBest of wishes to your family.\n\n\nEDIT: The cause of my first stroke was a kidney failure. As explained by the doctors, the kidneys weren't getting enough blood, this caused an increment on my blood pressure (I was at 210/140) and in turn caused a clot to reach my brain. \n\nI did not get a full explanation the second time.",

Things will get better and since she was so young, as the doctors told us, she may get closer to her baseline than expected. You are not alone in this struggle. I will give 3 pieces of advice:\n\n1. Do ALL the rehab they prescribe. My wife was emotionless for months because of where her stroke was in her brain. The rehab helped a lot.\n2. Maximize and dig deep within her benefits and yours. There were services I had no idea about until this happened.\n3.  Out of pocket maximum. This is the most you will pay for her medical care. Know it. Plan for it. Save some to an HSA to save taxes on it.\n\nAlso don\u2019t forget yourself. I\u2019ve been so consumed with purpose, work, and trying to be super dad that I forgot about me. I recently found out all the stress has caused hypertension. Don\u2019t let your small releases, things like the gym, hobbies, or other things fade away.  Your family needs you and I know you can do it. It will get better I promise.",

We have trained several members of ASA's national call center to answer your questions about stroke.\n\nCall us Monday- Friday between 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. CT at 1-888-4-STROKE (1-888-478-7653).\n\n/u/takeandbake added this as an update.

            "comment": "First, I'm so sorry. \n\nThere is a lot of good advice here. I'm going to give you a little check list and then add my bit at the end:\n\n- Get your wife on Permanent Disability: https://www.ssa.gov/disability/\n\n- Look into discharging student loans. See /u/takeandbake comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7l9vsd/wife_had_a_stroke_need_to_protect_family_and/drkm9xf/\n\n- Look into legal separation or divorce (sucks, but might be the best option to protect your family financially). \n\n- You should talk to a pro. An estate lawyer and a fee only financial advisor. \n\n- Look into programs in your area for help caring for disabled people. You NEED to take care of yourself and your kids. Sometimes these programs will come watch your wife, so you can get a night off, sometimes they help financially. I've seen one where they come clean your house or take care of yard work. Every place is different. \n\n- Take care of yourself and your daughters' mental health. This is a big life change. Also, you can't take care of everyone else if you are falling apart. Make sure you take care of you.\n\nProtect your assets from future bankruptcy and creditors:\n \n- Retirement accounts: 401k, 401b, IRAs etc. are protected\n\n- To a lesser degree, so are 529s:\n http://www.bankruptcylawnetwork.com/section-529-plans-in-bankruptcy/\n\n- Your primary residence is protected as well.\n\nAgain, contact a professional. There is a LOT to process and I'm sure you are not doing your best thinking. Get a notebook or start a document in your favorite office software and take really really good notes. Review them regularly. Make more check lists. Pace yourself. You are not going to get this all done in one week or even one month.",

I kept asking myself how the hell could this happen, she's only 34 this only happens to old people .  This was by far the scariest moment of my life and I had no idea how I was going to handle it.\n\nWe went through every emotional spectrum there was, asking God why he let this happen or is this a test.  The doctors couldn't tell why and eventually we realized why does not matter but moving forward does.\n\nThe bottom line is my family will be thinking about your family, listen to your doctors but im telling you from my own experience that there is always hope.

The amount citizens get should be a function of their income, where Bill Gates get $0.10 in housing assistance, and the poor single mother gets $300.  If benefits were a gradual curve instead of a series of cliffs it would remove the incentive for people to stay at a lower income. The bonus benefit is that every citizen is involved in the program and see the results it produces, which would help citizens guide the legislative branch during elections.\n\nJust think how crazy it is that the labor market wants to give you a raise, they see value in you and your work.  Suddenly you are worth more to them, but you have to decline a raise in order to get more government money.",

Her loving husband, my grandfather, and their children, took care of her and taught her how to talk again. Today, she is well, and she is truly the happiest person I've ever met. They live in a one million dollar home, and seem to be doing very well. She is loved by her husband, and everyone she meets.\n\nThere is hope, OP. Stay strong, especially for her.",

You may be missing out on key benefits you can only claim while she is employed.\n\nLoan forgiveness is easy.  My wife had to do it, and it isn't much of a hurdle.  It only took a couple of phone calls and a form.\n\nSSI  should be applied for immediately, even before your wife is let go.  You may find it easier if you have an attorney take care of this.  In the mean time, if your wife has short/long term disability through her company, that needs to be filed for (hence needing a copy of her current benefits).",

            "comment": "I am very sorry to hear of your wife\u2019s illness. Some suggestions:\n\n1.  Get referrals from friends and family to 3 estate planning attorneys. Interview them - be blunt and clear as you describe your situation. Let them know you need efficient, economical legal services that work for you and your family. Listen carefully, then choose one. \n\n2.  Determine with your attorney what you, your wife, and your kids need in the way of estate planning. Get advance directives done for you and wife. Figure out three family or friends who would be willing to raise your kids if something happened to you. Get all of this memorialized in legal docs, whether a trust or other. \n\n3.  Ask attorney what else you need, what has been missed, if anything. Get it done. You will want to squirm out of it - do not. Keep pushing yourself until the documents are done, you have copies at home and in a safe deposit box and you feel the loop is closed. Get it done. If you don\u2019t like the attorney you\u2019ve chosen, stop the work, get other referrals, choose a new one, Fire the first attorney and have #2 finish to your satisfaction. Get it done. \n\n4. Get help from social worker to get wife a) admitted to an appropriate Medicaid facility for care or b) set up in-home care with Medicaid. If wife is in facility, visit weekly and always at random, unannounced times. Take notes and record what you see, hear and discuss with staff. \n\n5.  Shift assets from wife to you so that she qualifies for Medicaid. Do before #4. \n\n6.  Deal with wife\u2019s school loans. Determine if you have any responsibility. Get doctors letter/ assessment to aid in discharge. \n\n7.  Go in person to your local Social Security office and explain the situation. Apply for disability. Be a face they know. It makes a difference. Use doctor\u2019s letter/assessment. Make sure you provide everything asked for. Complete the forms neatly. Always make and keep copies for yourself. If you mail correspondence or documents, send them Certified so that you have a record. \n\n8.  Talk with your kids - this is traumatic for them. \n\n9.  Talk with a professional - this is traumatic. \n\nThese are just a start - hang in there. You have a lot of people pulling for you. ",

It is not good for anyone to live that or grow up with that.\n\nMy father was not even fully paralyzed from stroke but massively brain damaged, but he somehow survived for years with diabetes, massive multiple stroke and heart attacks. \n\n11 years in a nursing home and hospitals, he was a high level sales executive and every last penny was drained taking care of him and he had heart attacks and strokes after the big one too, one on my birthday when I was 12. \n\nThere are groups of people that shouldn't be forced to \"live\" just to be alive, it is so wrong and miserable for everyone.",

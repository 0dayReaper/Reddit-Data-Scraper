    "postText": "Hey all, was hoping I could get some advice. I am a 26M, graduated from my Masters program in December 2021. I currently have about $62,000 in student loans (split into three $20,000 loans) and was wondering if I should pay it all off when August rolls around the the pause is over, or pay in increments to keep some money saved. Information to consider...\n\nIncome: $130,000\n\nSavings: $80,000 at the end of August\n\nRetirement: $20,000\n\nCash on hand: $8,000\n\nMontly Expenses: around $2,000 - $2,500\n\nLet me know how you would approach this.. thanks!",

            "comment": "The faster you pay it off, the less you pay in interest. If I'm understanding correctly, you currently have enough cash to pay everything off with \\~$20,000 left.\n\n$20,000 is about 8-10 months' expenses for you. The general advice is to keep 3-6 months' expenses as an emergency fund. So, ask yourself, is there a reason why you believe you need MORE than that in the near-term?\n\nReasons could be:\n\n* You believe your job is somewhat at risk\n* You foresee a big expense or purchase in the near term\n\nWith your monthly expenses as low as they are (relative to your salary), you should be able to rebuild your savings very quickly.\n\nPersonally, I would pay it all off, but use this thought process to guide your decision.",

            "comment": "Definitely depends on the interest rate. And inflation. As long as inflation is equal to or higher than the interest rate, you should probably take your time paying the balance down. Especially if the Up-To-$1,500 student loan interest income adjustment for federal taxes remains a thing.\n\nEDIT: Also depends on the interest rate you're getting on your $80,000 savings. If that's lower than your loan interest rate, then you might be better off paying it all off. Or at least moving some savings into more aggressive investments.",

                            "comment": "Honestly, with those numbers, I'd pay off $37,000 or so of the highest-interest student loans in August so that the annual interest on the remaining balance (assuming U.S.) is about $1,500 (oversimplifying because I don't know the exact rates resulting in the average and because August-December is only a partial tax year and you will be making payments through 2024, too). Accounting for tax breaks, the interest rate on the remaining loans wouldn't be too much higher than the interest on your savings. After that, I'd probably start focusing on long-term investing and while keeping at least a decent chunk of savings, only paying off the loans at or modestly above the minimum\\* amount.\n\n*\\*If you get \"ahead\" in your student loan payments by doing this, you may need to calculate yourself how much to pay each month to pay off the loan by a certain target date (could be end of the loan term, or earlier if you want), if you want it to be the same amount every month. The amount provided by the loan servicer is not always helpful once you get ahead. Google \"interest rate formula\" or similar for this. It's a pretty simple formula.*",

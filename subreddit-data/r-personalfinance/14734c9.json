I went to go try to go get a new bank account one day and Chase told me I couldn\u2019t because I had an open and delinquent account at a credit union. She pitched fit when I told her she needed to clear it up because she\u2019d need to pay the NSF fees.\n\nAround the same time, I went to to get a cell phone and was told \u201cwith my credit\u201d I could have up to 4 lines. I\u2019d never had a credit card and immediately knew my mom had used my name on something for credit.\n\nI was like 22 when all of this happened. When I was 30, I started getting calls from a furniture place trying to locate my mom because she had put me down as a co-signer and then stopped paying.\n\nI say all of this to caution you to keep a close eye on your credit report. I hope your mom isn\u2019t like mine, but better safe.",

You could try a situation where your mom signs a promissory note that she will pay you back for the loan you are giving her (indirectly by paying off the CC.) If she does not agree to that, don't forget that you are a co-owner of the card. You have every right to request that apple to close the credit line, just as your mom does. This will prevent her from running the balance any higher at least. This possibility may encourage your mom to pay it off faster if she relies on the credit line.",

Unbeknownst to me when I was curious about my credit score after graduating from college is when I found out about it all. I gave her the opportunity to pay it all back within a given timeframe and when she didn\u2019t, I decided to file a police report and then provide that report to all creditors.

    "postText": "I have 7 credit cards, all together about $35k credit line. I use them every month, then I pay my balances to $0 before the due date. Only 2 of the cards have an annual fee, about $100 each.\n\nI just use credit cards for points/rewards of the purchases that I would make anyway. I never spend $$ I don\u2019t have, my budget is very well-kept. \n\nWF opened 5/2023- $3,000\n\nChase opened 6/2022- $2,800\n\nDiscover opened 4/2020- $10,000\n\nChase opened 12/2019- $11,200\n\nBarclays opened 12/2017- $1,450\n\nDiscover opened 5/2016- $4,500\n\nCitiCard opened 5/2016- $5,000\n\n\nI use my WF card to get points on rent (through Bilt), so I don\u2019t want to close that. No annual Fee. \n\nI use my Chase cards/rewards all the time, plus the status I get from one of them saves me a lot when I travel. 1 has a $95 annual fee. \n\nI don\u2019t use my Discover cards a lot bc my Chase card gives me 1.5% cash back, but that\u2019s like 1/3 of my total credit line if I close my Discover accounts. No annual fees. \n\nI don\u2019t fly much, so my Citicard doesn\u2019t do me much good. But that\u2019s my oldest account so I\u2019m scared for my credit score if I close it. Annual fee $99. \n\nI don\u2019t really use/like the rewards I get from Barclays, it used to give me phone insurance but they changed it last year. Also one of my oldest accounts, so I\u2019m hesitant to close it. No annual fee. \n\n\nIs it helping my credit to keep all these accounts open, considering I don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d them, and some I don\u2019t like using? If I should close some of them, which ones do you suggest?",

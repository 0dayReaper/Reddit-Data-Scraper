    "postText": "I was a retail merchandiser for a large company that decided to switch to a third party company to handle their in store needs. It was part time (~20-25 hours a week) for most of the year, but went to 40 hours October-December. My end date was 6/2. Company is paying 3 weeks severance and a bonus. The severance is supposed to be based on my average hours over the past year, but not sure how they'll calculate it and haven't received the pay yet. \n\nWhen the company laid us off they said they would pass along our info to the third party company. I got the call from them asking if I wanted more info and I said yes. They called me the next day and went over the job with me. It's only 15 hours per week, no paid mileage or drive time, pto, or holidays (all benefits my last job had). I was told starting pay was $14, but I said I would need $17, I was making $16.56 at my other job. The hiring manager said she'd need to reach out to upper management to see if they would approve the $17. \n\nShe called me back a few hours later to tell me she got me the $17 approved, sent me the job offer to my email and guided me through opening their email, providing my SSN, and signing the offer letter while on the phone. Felt like it was rushed.\n\nI filed for unemployment today and would get the max in my state $275. Going to work for this other company would be $255 before tax. \n\nThis new job does not seem worth it at all and I'm debating on turning down their offer, taking the unemployment after I get my severance paid out and finding a full time job. \n\nWould it be better to take this job and continue my job search or turn it down and take unemployment while searching for a job? The unemployment route would be easier atm because my wife and I share a car. Bills aren't really an issue either and we rent from my mom and she's very helpful in these situations.",

Do your research and understand what is and isn't allowed to be rejected without losing claim to your benefits.",

Questions would be as follows\n\n1. does this offer preclude you from qualifying based on it's timing relative to your severance and\n2. does this offer preclude you from qualifying based on hours/wage.\n3. (if 1 &amp; 2 aren't precluding) does this offer make sense for you based on your market, wants, and intangibles of the offer.\n\nThe pessimist in me says that this offer is being made to give your employer ammo for rejecting a claim because you received a 'suitable offer' but I am not aware or familiar of the rules that apply to you. Certainly I understand it may not be a good fit based on your total income and career wants but if it's this or nothing you'd want to know that ahead of making the call.",

Thought it'd be a way to have a job lined up for when I get laid off. Of course we didn't have any info and it was based on what jobs the new company had available. I  figured it wouldn't be as good as my last job, but didn't know it was only going to be 15 hours until I got the call.\n\nNot sure if they passed the employee info along of those who said no. So I could've said no, probably would've had I known this was the offer.",

    "postText": "I've had an AmEx Blue card since 2005.  It had a pretty high credit limit, was my oldest credit card, and the was the only AmEx card I had open.  I never used it much, and had it set to autopay.  I got a single email notification that it was going to be closed due to inactivity, which I missed. I just realized it was closed due to a credit alert.  I called them to see if it could be reopened, and they said no, but I could reapply for a new one.\n\nMy wife and I are looking to buy a house within the next year, and it looks like this account closure decreased my credit score by \\~ 15 points.\n\nI am guessing that applying for a new one would trigger a hard credit pull and lower my score even more? Should I open a new one after we buy a house, even if I don't plan to use it much?",

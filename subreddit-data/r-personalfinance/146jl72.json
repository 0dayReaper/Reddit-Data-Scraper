    "postText": "Hi there I just got a huge promotion to Seattle and about to relocate but I have an important question. I got separated from my baby momma and long story short some payments weren't made on the vehicle she took and ran into the ground. It's in my name and now I'm on the hook for it. That and a few other things that have gone into collections I was presented an option of doing a consolidation loan with a lower payment and interest than my current auto loan. But I worry this would effect my eligibility to apply for an apartment during my move to Seattle. Is it better to do that now? Pay off the car and past due accounts and then apply? Or do that after I get the apartment? Thank you!",

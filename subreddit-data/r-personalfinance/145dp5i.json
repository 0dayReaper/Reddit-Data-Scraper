    "postText": "I am in the beginning stages of planning to file for bankruptcy. In Kentucky for context. This is entirely new to me and essentially I got an obscenely expensive car a few years ago and it just got repossessed, so I think I\u2019m going to file for bankruptcy to  avoid being garnished and lose everything. Any advice is appreciated. \n\nMainly my question is if I file can I potentially lose my home? I don\u2019t have any problems with paying the mortgage or anything regarding the house however I don\u2019t want to file and lose my home. How can I go about bankruptcy and it not affect my home loan, or is that not a possibility to avoid? Help!",

So provide lots of numbers, including:\n\n- Home value\n\n- Outstanding balance on mortgage\n\n- Your income\n\n- Value of the car that got repo'd\n\n- What you owe on said car\n\nAnd do a quick google search on \"Bankruptcy homestead exemption &lt;your state&gt;\" and tell us what it reads out.",

                    "comment": "A bankruptcy homestead exemption allows one to exempt their interest in a property or asset in order to avoid said asset from being liquidated as part of a bankruptcy case. It works as follows: if one has $25,000 in equity in their home, and their state\u2019s homestead exemption is above that amount, then the home cannot be sold by a bankruptcy trustee to help pay their debts. However, if the state\u2019s exemption amount is less than $25,000, then the trustee would sell the house, pay off the mortgage, and then give the debtor an amount equal to that of the state\u2019s homestead exemption. Any remaining balance from the sale would be used to pay back creditors.\n\nSo my home values at 140,000. The way I understand it and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, this is all fresh information, if my home was worth 165,000 or more then I would have to sell to pay my debts? I have only been in it since 2021 so it\u2019s still a newer loan.",

If one is married and filing for bankruptcy jointly with their spouse, then the two can combine their individual exemption amounts, raising that number to $10,000.\n\nKentucky law also allows people to choose whether they will apply the state\u2019s exemptions to their case, or follow federal guidelines instead. Per Section 11.522.d(1) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the federal homestead exemption is $15,000. If one chooses to follow the federal homestead exemption, they must also follow all other federal exemption guidelines as well.",

Keep paying your mortgage and your other debts (hopefully paying those off). I\u2019m not sure how you got the loan for the car in the first place but you have a lot of room to negotiate if the car was originally only worth $15,000 and they added to the loan another $15,000 in \u201cfees\u201d that weren\u2019t related.",

The car is only worth about 15-20grand but I was upside down on it when I got it about for about 15 grand with all the added on junk warranties. Mortgage is 800 month. I was doing penny to penny paychecks to keep up with the car payments, however I was lagging the car payment so I would pay two at a time to pay everything else and it was repossessed last week. \n\nSo ultimately I can bail out the car for 2600 or let it go and file for bankruptcy but the house is what I don\u2019t want to lose if it\u2019s even possible. In short, I fucked up bad getting the car and it\u2019s downhill from there.",

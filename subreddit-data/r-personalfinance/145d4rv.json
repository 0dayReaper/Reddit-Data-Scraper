    "postText": "I would like to understand how the IRS calculates the penalty. For example, if we open a 529 account today (june 2023 ) with $200k and buy a 1-year 5% CD, we will have $10k of interest in July next year. What happens if we use $10k to pay for a private school and simply withdraw, let's say, $100k? Will we be liable for taxes and penalty on the interest?\"",

So this means:\n\n* 95% * 100K = 95K = tax/penalty free\n\nGains, however, would be penalized/taxed.  So this means:\n\n* 5% * 100K = 5K subject to tax/penalty.",

Distributions will always contain a pro-rated portion of principal and earnings, you cannot pick lots or take only contributions out.",

    "postText": "As I keep reading the forum I keep seeing people getting in trouble with the belief that somehow there is no way to understand all this. They can't seem to grasp how to catch up, let alone get ahead. It all boils down to this: Cashflow.\n\nWhat you make, minus what you spend, equals your cash flow. The more positive cash flow you have, the more options you have.\n\nHere's another tidbit: You have more control over your spending than over your earning. If you want to take control of your life, go over your spending with a fine tooth comb and clean it up. Ok, it can get more complicated from here but honestly; you need to address this foundational building block before anything else can fall into place.\n\nThat's it, I'm ready to get off the soapbox.",

But you are right, I should have used \"complex\" instead of \"hard\".\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that no amount of reshuffling debt, no amount of investments, not amount of anything, can work without fixing the underlying cash flow situation. Some people may need to make some hard choices in order to get there but if you don't fix it, anything and everything else is unsustainable window dressing.",

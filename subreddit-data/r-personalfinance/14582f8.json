    "postText": "I am interviewing for a job where the description contains the below wording. Articles I can find online seem to be mixed, so I\u2019m unclear as to if I would be subject to this. I\u2019m based near the Denver office but would plan to work fully remotely. \n\n\u201cThis role may be performed fully remotely within the United States. Please note that our US headquarters are located in NYC. We also have office hubs in Austin, Miami, Denver, Mountain View, and Seattle. If the remote work is performed outside of these office, income may be subject to New York State tax withholding.\u201d\n\nThanks in advance for any assistance on this.",

The way it works here is that you are tied to the office within your state, but if your state does not have a hub then you are tied to the NY office. You are considered to be remotely working for the office to which you are tied.\n\nIn the former situation, you would be both living in state X and working for a company based in state X so you would only potentially owe income taxes in that state. The fact that the headquarters is in NY doesn't matter because of the local office. \n\nIn the latter situation, you would have tax obligations to NY and also your state of residence. In just about every situation, you get credit for the state income taxes paid to one state on the other state's return (so you do not get taxed twice on the same income). *(Beware, there are a lot of myths out there about situations where you would get taxed twice)*",

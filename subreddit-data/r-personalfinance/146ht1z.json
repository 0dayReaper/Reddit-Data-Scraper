    "postText": "Hello all, my wife and I just bought a house and we finally received our earnest money back in a check made out to both of us. She\u2019s currently with her her parents visiting their homeland. We don\u2019t have a joint account yet. Am I able to deposit it? She said I can sign on her behalf if I have to since it\u2019s made out to both of us. I\u2019m just not sure the process and if it\u2019s necessary to have her signature, but if so, is it okay to sign for my wife? If it matters, I paid the earnest money for the house and still have the cashier\u2019s check receipt.",

I mobile-deposited every single one and the bank didn't question a thing.\n\nWorked nicely for me, kinda scary when you think about the bank's security though.",

My first wife hid a lot of crazy spending from me on her own credit card, and I'm fairly certain that both A and B were the case.\n\nMy forever wife and I are completely integrated financially. Full transparency on both ends, joint accounts and cards. The only thing that is truly \"mine\" or \"hers\" financially is birthday money we still get from my parents.",

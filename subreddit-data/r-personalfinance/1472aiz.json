    "postText": "I\u2019m going to have to give up my car for repossession after fighting for my job the last 3 months i finally get to go back. However i\u2019m 50 days passed due ( the finance company send to loss mit after 50 days) for the 4th time i simply can\u2019t afford the car which is 460$ a month and insurance that is $420 a month. Obviously my credit is not good at all and with no other option I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything i should try to do or anything to make this easier? I finally get to go back to work after 3 months this week and i make good money biweekly i sure could probably save up for a cash car within a few weeks. Any tips or advice? I\u2019m almost looking at this like a chance to restart my life.",

If i could get cheaper insurance i would\u2019ve been fine but thats the cheapest i found and is now the reason I\u2019m here unfortunately.",

Even if you decide the car needs to go, selling it yourself is a much better option than repo as the bank will sell it at auction (not necessarily for a good price), add on tow fees and you'll still owe that balance.\n\nFrom my perspective, there's two options:\n* If you're not underwater, you can downgrade by selling private party and paying off the loan.\n* If you're underwater and believe you can save up enough in a few weeks to buy a cash car, it (may) be possible to explain that to the bank, possibly offer to make a partial payment and hope they will give you a few weeks to get caught up. From there, if you decide to downgrade, you would pay down the loan until no longer underwater and you can sell private party.",

    "postText": "Looking for advice on a property I bought last year. Details are: purchased lot at $43k with $11k down. Owner Financed Loan of $32,250 on a 2-year balloon with a 10-year amortization at 7% interest. Balloon payment will be due April 2024 at around $27k. \n\nCome April 2024, what would be best option  to refinance or what would be your advice? Currently, the payment is very doable for us but I feel like we got a great interest rate that we won\u2019t be able to match with current market and the fact it is land. I really don\u2019t know what would be the best route to finance this (can\u2019t afford balloon payment due in lump sum). \n\nBackground info: bought planning to build in semi rural up and coming area. Since then, the $250-350k neighborhood is now selling for $600-700k, essentially pricing us out. We are moving to a new state anyway so should I keep this as a long term investment or just sell? I am viewing it as a long term asset that could potentially pay a kids college fund or something similar down the road.",

I have seen some lots appreciate very slowly and some very well. Your vacant lot will likely help the adjacent neighbours until you sell though haha.",

Only 3/4 acre but it\u2019s a peaceful area. Hard to predict future value but again it\u2019s a high growth area  (metro Atlanta) and established neighborhood. For context, lots were around sub $10k during primary construction of the neighborhood (~2007-2012), around $25-30k pre-pandemic (~2019), and are currently estimated around $50k.",

Two years ago I was planning to build a house on it to be closer to work but I got a great job offer in another state. I own the lot outright and only have to pay property taxes on it. \n\nI spoke to a realtor who said the lot hadn't appreciated much in the mean time. It might go up some, but I'm not sure. The realtor said it would be easier to sell for a premium if the lot was cleared and the driveway put in, but that will cost about $6k and I'm unsure if I want to put that kind of money into it. \n\nFor now I'm just holding. I put an ad on Craig's List every now and then just to see if I get any bites on it, but I'm not actively motivated to sell it and definitely won't give it away.",

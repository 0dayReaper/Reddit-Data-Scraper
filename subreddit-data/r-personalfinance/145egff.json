    "postText": "I got a call today from a vendor that I deal with stating my account was about to be sent to collections over 161 dollars.  I paid it on the spot. It was for some welding gas cylinders that I lease. I don\u2019t dispute the charge, but I have no record of ever receiving any invoice via mail or email.  \n\nI asked the person who took the payment who they report to and they said they report to Dunn and Bradstreet. I don\u2019t exactly know what that means, beyond that they are a business credit bureau. \n\nThe account is a business account but it is a sole proprietor and I am listed as the owner and I had to supply the last 4 digits of my SS number and my mailing address.  \n\nHow badly is this going to hose me? I\u2019m looking to purchase both a house and a car in the coming year. Am I wrong to be a little hopeful that this won\u2019t make it to my personal credit report? I can see my FICO score thru my KeyBank account and it shows that it was updated 5/30/23 with a score of 840. \n\nIs there anything I can do? Some things I am seeing online say a payment this late is likely to drop my credit score by almost 180 points. \n\nBummed.",

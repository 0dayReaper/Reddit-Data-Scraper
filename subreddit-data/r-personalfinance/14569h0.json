There are stocks that have grown 500% in a single year and were completely worthless a few years later.\n\nBetter to share what funds (or fund types) you've invested in and why you selected them -- that's a better way to get feedback.",

            "comment": "That 16% gain is not necessarily a good thing. Right now you are a buyer of stock, not a seller. When you buy eggs at the grocery store you don't say \"great! eggs are up 16%.\" When you retire, that's when you want high stock prices. If you chose good investment, don't worry about short term movement and just hold your course.\n\nWhen I first started investing in my 401k, I bought funds that had high morningstar rating. If the ratings dropped, I switched funds. In hindsight, this is called buy high sell low. Not good. I wish I knew then what I knew now; build a balanced portfolio of low cost index funds, and stick to my allocation through periodic rebalancing. There are so many good resources on how to do this: the wiki here, bogleheads website, and others. But take your time learning and don't be too hasty to switch things around.\n\nMost important thing is to have a plan that you understand and are comfortable with, and stick to it. It could be a single low cost target date fund, or a four fund portfolio, or something more complicated. And ignore short term gains or losses. Unless eggs are on sale, then stock up :)",

In order to put your 16% into context, you need to know what you invested, their annual fees, and your contribution schedule. Stocks inside a year is volatile. Even bonds are volatile when the rates are changing. Investing in January 2022, August 2022, October 2022, etc. could have plus/minus 25% difference in one year.",

Somebody said 11%, it is close to 8%.\n\nPut the money on an index fund and forget about it, don't muck with it at all. If it goes up leave it alone, if it goes down leave it alone. If it stays flat leave it alone. If people start saying that a market crash is imminent leave it alone. Nothing good comes from trying to time the market.",

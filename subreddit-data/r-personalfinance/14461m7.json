    "postText": "I am a low-income student with my EFC for FAFSA being $0, and I would receive about $8,000 back from grants for year 1. I recently got an internship that I work at sparsely and will make around/less than $2,000 by the end of the year. I am looking for another job earning $3,000-3,500 this summer. I may work on weekends when the fall semester rolls around, but I am unsure. Will this newly acquired income affect my financial aid significantly, or is it just a drop in the bucket? I want to see if I should get the new summer job or if it is smarter to stay in the same situation.",

            "comment": "What year are you in school?  The FAFSA uses financial info from 2 years ago, not the previous year.\n\nThere is also an income protection allowance. For the academic year 2023-2024 it's $7,040 \u2014 meaning there is nothing counted toward your contribution if you have $7,040 or less in yearly taxable and untaxable income.\n\nWhere you need to be careful is that 8K refund will probably count as taxable income to some extent.  Again, not the next year, but in two years. Edit to clarify - taxable for 2023, reportable for aid in 2024.\n\nDoes the school also use the CSS Profile?  That may request data from the previous year along with the data on the FAFSA.  But generally the CSS Profile is used to find assets that are available but not typically reported on the FAFSA, not to squeeze out an extra hundred bucks from a lower income student.",

I quote: *For the academic year 2023-2024 it's $7,040 \u2014 meaning there is nothing counted toward your contribution if you have $7,040 or less in yearly taxable and nontaxable income.*\n\nAs long as your income is at or below the income protection allowance, you should be fine.",

            "comment": "I don't think you'll have any issues getting financial aid based on your own income. \n\nHowever, if you're younger than 24 years old, I think FAFSA financial aid packages heavily rely on your parents' or guardian's income amount. This is also because your parents or guardian would be able to claim you as a dependent when they file taxes. Whoever claims you on their taxes (mother or father) will affect the amount of aid you receive through FAFSA.\n\nWhen you turn 24 years old, you are able to file for FAFSA independently without your parents' info and it'll be based on only your income.",

            "comment": "I have one peice of advice for you: \n\nMake sure you have $0 in assets when you apply for FAFSA next year. Any assets you mention will go directly against your aid.  \n\nBut to answer your question, there will be no difference between your income being $2k and $5-7k in terms of your EFC. You would need to make something above 20-30k to see a change. At least, that was the case a couple years back.",

            "comment": "You should be fine. The amount of financial aid you get is based on your \"cost of attendance,\" which is not the actual cost of your program but an amount that the feds believe covers your entire year of expenses including tuition, books, room and board, transportation and a lot more stuff. It's something like $26k, so that means if you take all of the grants and loans you're offered, it's supposed to cover all of the above (lol). They do take into account your dependents and number of people in the home in college when determining what your financial aid package will be. If there's any doubt, talk to the Financial Aid office. A fun fact about the school's FA staff is they have the power to make a \"professional judgment\" and adjust your cost of attendance if you have expenses that go above the generic amount (like if your program requires you to buy tools or equipment that other programs don't, or if your transportation cost is the increased due to having a clinical placement in another city etc.) \n\n\nYou shouldn't have to pay taxes on any federal FA unless it's forgiven, like if you can't pay your loans back in full within 20 years and are NOT enrolled in Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Pell grant is an entitlement program and is not taxed.",

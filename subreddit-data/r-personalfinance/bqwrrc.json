    "postText": "For minors, it's generally required for a parent to co-sign their bank accounts.  Once you turn 18, it's best to establish an account in your name ONLY, so you have sole control of it.  It would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bank/credit union than the one the minor account was in, to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account.\n\nThere are a couple reasons for this.  It doesn't take too long to find stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control.  The parents could have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe.  There could be disagreements between parents and their kids, so they take the money away as a punishment.  Or, it could just be old fashioned greed and the parents decide to just take the money.  It doesn't matter who earned the money that's in the account.  If two people are on it, the money belongs to both parties and the bank isn't going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash.\n\nKeep in mind also, having your own account does not mean that your parents can't send you money if you need it.  All they need is your account and routing number (the same information that would be on a check) to deposit money into the account.  In addition, there are any number of banking apps today they could use to send money to you if you're still being supported by them.  Other excuses may have good intentions at heart, but from a safety and security standpoint, it's best to establish an independent banking account.",

Thanks for all the advice, but as I said, I'm happy with my account. \n\nIf you have hostility toward WF that's understandable but I don't work for them, so the anger pointed my way does nothing.\n\nI looked into credit unions.

No one knew enough to call me on it.\n\nI knew that parents will do this shit, and I told kids if they wanted to send money home, they could set up an allotment to their parents. Reality was that I didn't trust a lot of the parents I dealt with. I didn't want kids to come back from Basic to an overdrawn account and their parents playing stupid. Remove the temptation.",

That was all it took.\n\nPoints when considering lying as a Recruiter.\n\n1 - kids these days will fact check you on Google before you are done with the sentence.\n\n2 - People under 25 tend to hear what they want to hear, no matter what words you actually use. \n\n3 - Most of these kids didn't have a freaking clue what questions to ask, which is more important than whether I tell the truth. Just like any other sales type job, ignorance is sometimes your friend. \n\n4 - I was stuck recruiting in a small town for 3 years. If I fucked over Bobby, my name became mud to all his friends, cousins, cousin's friends, and friend's cousins. It's counterproductive.",

YouTube used to give me lots of related videos to whatever I was watching, which would lead to lots of binging on my part.

Immediately red flags everywhere, and I told her I would absolutely not do that, but that she could download Paypal to send me funds. Absolutely refused to do that and only wanted to offer help if I opened a joint bank account with her. Nope, giant ass trap. The only joint account you should ever have is with your spouse, and that's only if you're in agreement with each other and would like to handle your finances that way.

Min wage at the time was like $7.50 and that's what they told me they'd pay. Fine, I guess, as 15 y/o semi-skilled labor (it was a trade). Ended up having to fight to get paid and then it got reduced to $5 an hour because \"that's what you'd bring home after taxes\". \n\nMe working for them prevented them having to hire an actual apprentice/helper and pay them 15-20 an hour, at least during the summer. Amazing that family can treat family so.\n\nMy unsolicited advice is thus: I'd make sure to keep an eye on your credit report. Not saying it's the case here, but I've heard many-a-time of parents taking excess loans out in their children's name. Also, I would look into going with a credit union over a bank because their fees tend to be better on you.  \n\nWhat's the public transport like in your city?

I had my eyes on some of the prizes for selling high and it sparked something entrepreneurial in me.\n\nI was living w/ my grandma at the time and she put the money on the top of the fridge for safe-keeping. Some family visited and saw it up there and cleaned out the envelope. Probably less than $100 at the time, but cleaned it out nonetheless. I had to embarrasingly explain to my neighbors that they wouldn't be getting the dough, nor their money back because it was stolen. Many didn't believe me and thought I kept it, as an irresponsible child. \n\nNever found out who took it, but I've got my suspicions. Man, my family kinda sucks.",

I could see their withdraws, my credit card payments, and my deposits.  Everything appeared normal.  \n\nThe co-signer of the parent plus loan received a letter one day notifying them that the loans had been placed into forbearance.  They reached out to me and asked if I knew anything. I had no idea and told them that.  Over the next several weeks, money was being withdrawn from the joint account to pay for the parent\u2019s everyday expenses (meals, groceries, etc).  \n\nAfter discussing the issue with them, one of them admitted to withdrawing the money, not using it for the student loans, and spending it on \u201cromantic relationships\u201d outside of their marriage. \n\nI don\u2019t talk to the one that took my money any more.  It\u2019s a weird feeling when you find out the person you thought you were helping turns around and hurts you. They had the opportunity to reduce their student loan debt by $60,000 (roughly) and instead used it for their own desires.  A separate bank account could have definitely improved my situation. Get it.  \n\nI got the money back from them eventually (401k withdraw).  It could have been worse.  But ya, get a separate bank account.  Families suck.",

This makes the legalities of having a bank account as a minor impossible. \n\nMost banks will let minor open joint accounts with a legal adult. What's really happening is the adult owns the account alone until the minor is of age. If the minor tries to transact on the account then the bank is usually nice enough to allow it but they would be fully within their rights to say \"no\" at any time and require the adult to do the transaction.",

Bonus if you can find a college account with a bonus offer that gives you money for opening the account and meeting requirements(direct deposit, paperless, online enrollment, etc)\n\nIf this is your first account, or transitioning from a high school account, MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND OVERDRAFT, how it works, what it does, and how much it cost. Did I mention to make sure how it works?\n\nBe aware of scams. If you're looking for a job, and find one online of someone offering a job like being an assistant, advertising, or something like that it MAY be a scam. Typical scam will consist of the fraudster mailing you a check in your name, and would require you to deposit it and send them part of the money back, or buying them gift cards and sending it to them. BEWARE of any job that requires you to send them money back or something of value. Often times if its a check they give you, it takes about a week for the check to be verified by the bank and get returned. You would have given the fraudster the money the bank made available to you prior to the bank actually receiving the money, which will result in the check being returned and your account becoming negative and consequently owing that money to the bank while the fraudster received the money YOU gave them.\n\nalso, OP mentioned giving acct number and routing number to have money transferred to your account, please be careful with this option, often times to set up transfers that require this type of transfer (ACH)is when you are adding your own external account from another bank. The bank will want to make sure its YOUR acct, and will send you two test deposits to confirm its you. If you do this without knowing, the other individual can not only send you money, but PULL money from your account. Please be aware of this method, majority of large banks are partnered with ZELLE, a third party service that allows you to send money to people via their phone number and/or email (safer as opposed to using your acct information). They can only send money, or request money. Typically this is an immediate transfer as opposed to ACH (account/routing number) which can takes a few business days to get to you.",

You want a savings account and a no-monthly-fee checking account. Credit unions, online banks, and small banks tend to have better customer service than large banks.\"",

However, everyone has different relationships with their families and if you completely trust one of your parents or a close relative having someone else on the account can also be a very helpful thing. If god forbid something happened to you and you were unable to go to the bank or get at your money yourself you have someone else who can do that for you without the hassle of dealing with banking regulations. Even if you were to die suddenly if someone else is on the account the money can be easily withdrawn. As someone who used to work as a teller it is heart breaking to explain to someone that we cant let them get the money to help with so and so's funeral or what have you because they arent on the account and we need an original copy of the death certificate. Its just one more thing that they have to deal with if something were to happen.",

My mom always told me that it was imperative to have another person on your account because, in case you die or can't access your money, they can for you, etc. What do I know as an 18yo. Fast forward a few years and I wake up CHRISTMAS MORNING at my boyfriend's house to my entire bank account empty. All of my savings gone. I freak out, call my mother who tells me she has no idea what it means, but since the withdrawal of all of the funds said something about a sherrif's office, to call my dad (who at the time, I barely speak to...bad manipulation techniques on my mom's part, bad behavior on both sides, really just a colossal mess).\n\nSo I call him and find out because her name was on my account, it got caught in the crossfire of some litigation between my parents (super messy divorce). He actually apologized right away and said he didn't know and he'd look into it, but I was so livid about being pulled into it (I was in my early twenties already, so maybe i should have learned better to separate the accounts. But I'd never had a reason to before...i guess everyone learns sometime)\n\nI called back my mom and cursed her out for getting me stuck in the middle too. Then she cursed me out for cursing her out, saying that it wasn't a big deal, someone in the family would give me back the money and I was making a mountain out of a molehill.\nBut my dad actually walked back into the sheriff's office the next day and said to put the money right back. In his whole career, the sheriff's said no one's ever done that before.\n\nSo thankfully because my dad's not a piece of shit to me, I got the whole sum back. But understanding that was because of him, I can definitely see that the situation could have ended much worse.\n\nIf anyone has a question about the process, I can try and answer it. But tl;dr, SEPARATE YOUR ACCOUNTS MY DUDES.\n\nAlso sorry if formatting sucks; I'm on mobile and not sure how it'll come out.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone I am in a odd situation. \n\nI purchased a house with my girlfriend approximately 3 years ago now, we are ending the relationship and I'm looking to cash-out refinance the house to remove her from the loan. I've been working with my lender and they said that I could get approved for the cash-out refi if I were to pay off my car loan, to improve my debt to income ratio.  I currently owe $6,000 on the car loan. If I were to pay off the car loan, I would push my savings down pretty low so I'm concerned about doing that.  I've got $25k in savings right now, I committed to a $10k down payment for the new loan, on top of the equity payout I would receive from cashing out.  I was speaking to my mom, and fortunately she offered to lend me cash to pay off the car loan to navigate around this hurdle.\n\nMy question is, when I go into underwriting will having a \"third party\" pay off my car loan looks suspicious or raise any eyebrows? I would not be making big cash deposits into my savings, which I've heard is typically when problems arise in underwriting.  She would just pay off the car loan, eliminating that debt from my portfolio.\n\nIs this something that I could ask my lender directly?  Any insight provided would be appreciated!",

Is that the time to do that?\n\n$6k I'm considering as alot due to my current savings being $25k.  So, to pay off the $6k car loan would take me down to $19k, then $10k towards the down payment would take me down to $9k and I just sent out ~$4k in checks for my quarterly fed/state tax vouchers, so then savings would be down to $5k when the dust settled.  I would prefer to have more of a safety net than that in the bank if I can help it.  \n\nHome is going to be refinanced for $330k, I should get ~39k of equity out of it to apply to the new loan.  I make $90k a year as a 1099 IT consultant",

But I am a bit surprised that a lender would consider 6k relevant relative to your DTI on a 300k+ mortgage. Usually a final loan payment is contradictory and temporarily dampens your credit, which isn't ideal when going for the refi.\n\nPer actually saying it is a gift it doesn't matter for the car payoff, it only matters for the new loan seeing a \"random\" large cash deposit and withdrawal, they have to make a good faith effort to know it isn't criminal related when giving you a loan.",

If you disclose the \"gift\" of the loan payoff from your mother, that shouldn't raise any eyebrows, it happens all the time - family member gifts a sum to help with down payment or whatever. So you pay her back over time, it's not considered a loan the same way a car payment would be. Having bought multiple houses and cars over my 51 years on this planet, I see no issue here.",

In this instance, where you're paying off an unrelated debt, I doubt the underwriter will pick at it that much. The loan originator will look over your bank statements and credit report, and may ask. Can't hurt to mention it to the broker/originator and ask. They may want to see a gift letter just so it doesn't pop during underwriting and cause a delay.",

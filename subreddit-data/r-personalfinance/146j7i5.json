    "postText": "I am looking for some tools to help do \"what if\" scenarios as my wife (35) and I (38) are trying to buy a house. We have a bunch of different funds we can tap into for a down payment and putting a good amount towards retirement savings but not sure how using different combos will impact our retirement planning.\n\nThis post is mostly looking for tools to help conduct the analysis but I will put our whole financial picture below for other ideas.\n\nWe did recently go to a financial planner who put together a basic financial plan for us but because we weren't as prepared we didn't get all of our scenarios covered.\n\nBelow is some of our financial picture and the questions we are grappling with that we are hoping a tool or method will help us analyze.\n\nWe live in San Diego which is hcol. condos and houses in the areas we want to live (that I think are in our budget) range from 800k to 1.25mil.\n\nWe have $110k sitting in an HYSA for a down payment and add $2300 a month to it as we keep renting\n\nWe have a house in CT that we rent out. 200k and 20y left on the mortgage and we should be able to sell for 600k. Because of maintenance costs we seem to lose about 3-5k on the house every year. Should we sell it to help buy a house or better to keep it to have the income stream in retirement? What if we switch it from long term rental to a short term rental?\n\nI have $200k sitting in a brokerage account. If I sold it after taxes we would have about $150k. Should we tap into this for the down payment or better to have this contribute to our retirement?\n\nOur retirement accounts consist of 401ks and HSA. Combined we have about $700k. I max out my 401k and HSA and my wife is maxing HSA and saving 10% (company matched up to 6%).  If we reduce the amount we are putting in to our retirement accounts so we can afford a higher monthly mortgage payment how much will that impact our retirement?\n\nI know we are doing well but the high cost of housing here in San Diego definitely has us feeling a little defeated.",

    "postText": "I am 20 years old, still living with my parents. I am a carpenter and net around $3,500 a month without over time. I have no debt. Right now I could comfortably drop a 10k down payment. Apartments in good areas tend to start at $1k a month. Decent smaller houses start around $150k. A nerd wallet calculator says that a house around this price range would cost around $1k a month as well. I already feel overwhelmed between work, (lots of over time), working on projects at my parents house, online classes, and attempting to have hobbies. \n\nGrowing up everyone around me always said that owning is better than renting. I know that ownership makes more financial sense past 5 years. I know I want to own a home eventually, but I don\u2019t know if it makes sense for me right now. I like the idea of not having to worry about maintenance, or spending time on lawn care, and having the flexibility to move more easily. I also have the thought that getting an apartment in a nice area will put me around other professional young people and maybe improve my social life. Not sure if that is true or not.\n\nRight now I\u2019m thinking about getting a one year lease for an apartment to let me get a feel for living on my own. Hopefully then I will have a better idea of my options. I\u2019ve also considered getting a fixer upper and working on it myself, but I don\u2019t know if setting my self up to work up to 80 hours a week is a good idea.",

If so, home ownership may be a better idea.\n\nFor reference, I was in a similar boat to you about 25 years ago.  I made decent money, had little overhead and wanted my own place.  Rent was about $350 a month and house payment for the size house I wanted where I wanted was about $550.  I convinced my girlfriend at that time (wife now) that a house was a better idea than an apartment even though it would significantly decrease our free money. \n\n10 years ago we sold that house for more than triple what we paid for it and used that money to mostly buy our current house which has also tripled in value since that purchase. If we had gone to an apartment we instead would have been paying significantly more in rent and have nothing to show for it.  I have legit made more in equity in this current house than my SALARY.  Now for that to matter we would have to sell this house and move further out of town or move to a new area and for the past 25 years this has been consistently one of the fastest growing parts of the country so your mileage may vary, but it\u2019s something to consider.",

With a house, if your mortgage, taxes, PMI, etc. are $1k/month, that's the **least** you'll spend. You've also got the AC/furnace going out, a new roof after a storm, lawn care (or equipment if you're doing it yourself), etc. \n\nThe **most** time you'll commit to maintaining an apartment is cleaning it. The **least** time you'll commit to maintaining a house is cleaning it. You've also got fixing the leak under the sink, replacing the siding that's rotting out, mow the lawn (or pay someone to do it), etc.\n\nRenting apartments are easy, and easy to budget for. You're not building equity, but you're trading that for a very simple living arrangement. Renting a house starts to introduce you to some more of the time-sinks, while still protecting you from a lot of the financial pitfalls. Owning an apartment allows you to build equity but exposes you to limited financial unpredictability, while still protecting you from a lot of the time-sinks. \n\nOwning a house is by far the hardest, both from a financial planning and time-management point of view. You have all the monetary risks and rewards, as well as all the time investment. You really should be very committed before going that route, but it can be incredibly rewarding to make a place **yours**.\n\nJust starting out in life, it's probably a good idea to start in a rented apartment. Ease yourself into the rest of it down the road, if you want. If you're a very responsible and very committed person, you can jump right into ownership - but most people aren't there as their first time living on their own.",

Buying and selling a house is really expensive and unless home prices happen to be spiking, there's a good chance of losing money if you have to sell within the first few years.\n\nAnother factor is that maintaining a house takes a lot more time and costs more than an apartment. When something breaks in an apartment, you call the landlord and they do the work and pay the cost of the repair.  When something breaks in a house, you either have to take the time to fix it yourself or pay someone else to do it and you have to buy whatever needs to be replaced.\n\nAlso, if the house has a yard, you'll need to maintain that which can take a lot of time and/or cost a good bit of money.\n\nMy opinion is that for someone first going out on their own, it's probably better to start with an apartment and first learn about taking care of yourself and grocery shopping and cooking and cleaning and all of that and then when you've got that mastered, move on to the additional burden of a house.",

You talked about living in the house for at least 5 years and how the maintenance in an apartment isn't your problem. The only other thing I would mention is that you may have a significant other and if you buy a house that will be something to sort out. That said, $150k for a home will be a better investment that rent. There are advantages to each, so in my view there is no clear cut \"better choice\".  Good luck!",

The market is not going to appreciate the same way it has been.  It also sounds like you understand it is a lifestyle choice. Maintaining a house takes work. Especially if it is an older home and I don't know many being built for $150k these day... I imagine even in the cheaper parts of the country new homes cost more than that. The cost to sell a home if you only plan to hold it for a few years is also expensive and again with small towns how many people are buying? Are you going to be holding and paying a mortgage while in another city if you take another job? lots to think about and if you are young and not settled I wouldn't buy. I also think they are best case scenarios... what if the market falls out and you are underwater on it?",

Most states have a cap on how much they can go up per year though. \n\nIf you have a $400,000 house in NJ you would pay $9,600 in taxes the first year. They added a 2% cap per year though so the most you would pay in the second year is $9,792 for a monthly increase of $16. In 10 years it would be $11,702.35 for a monthly increase of $175.20. \n\nOn a $100,000 house, the increase after 10 years would only be $35.47 per month.\n\nLook at rental rates anywhere in the country and tell me that you're only paying $175 more per month that you did 10 years ago.\n\nHOA fees only go up if you have one.

Every year, a $200 increase per month.\n\n**Mortgage** - bought a house within commuting distance but outside of the city, mortgage (p&amp;i, insurance, property tax) was $2700 at first, then removed PMI and refinanced the loan to a better rate. The mortgage is now $2350 all-in (p&amp;I, insurance, property tax).\n\n\nRent is the minimum you will pay to live there, because it is not guaranteed to stay the same, and can go up each year.\n\nMortgage is the maximum you will pay, as a fixed loan locks in the monthly price and it will not go up each year (principal and interest locked, tax and insurance could fluctuate).\n\n\nThe house we once rented for $2600 is now renting for $4000, and the house we own and pay $2350 for would rent for over $3000.

You grab some buddies from work and bang out that new roof for cost of materials some pizza and beer.  You return the favor when they need a new deck or similar.  So realistically the OP should be paying far less on maintenance than the apartment would.\n\nNow often it's an apples/oranges thing rent some 800sqf apartment or buy a 2k of house with a yard room for a pool and space for a dog is very different.  Renting a 2ksqf house is going to cost you more than buying and maintaining that same house every time.",

If you have an escrow, it might also include insurance and property taxes.  \n  \nPrincipal &amp; Interest / Rent:  \nOwn: These are fixed over time.  If you want to move out, you will likely owe fees to a real estate agent, could lose money on the sale, and cannot control exactly when or if the sale happens.  \nRent: Likely to go up over time, but you'll know in advance, and can choose to not accept the increase and move out, usually without anything extra due to the landlord.  \n  \nTaxes:  \nOwn: Often a spike during the second year for a new house, when the property value adjusts from empty lot to finished home.  Or there could be new bond packages, change in taxes due to comp sales, etc.  Generally steadier for older, well-established properties.  \nRent: You don't directly pay the taxes, and your landlord has to eat any increases until they can be factored into future rent increases, which you can decline by moving out if they exceed market rates.  \n  \nInsurance:  \nOwn: Generally steady, but could increase if you live somewhere with common disasters like hurricanes, fires, or flooding.  \nRent: Renter's insurance is generally cheap, and you aren't responsible for insuring anything else.  \n  \nMaintenance:  \nOwn: You have to maintain or repair everything.  Generally budget 3-5% of your home's value each year for maintenance, but this can be spiky - nothing one year, new HVAC the next, new roof.  \nRent: None of those things are your problem.  The owner can't even (usually, legally) take the cost of new carpet and a fresh coat of paint out of your deposit when you leave.  The owner is usually (depending on the state) legally obligated to repair things efficiently, and in some states you can withhold rent until they do, or break your lease and move out, or, if they don't do it fast enough, repair it yourself and take the cost out of your rent payment.",

Though, most mortgages don't make it to term, because people either move, divorce, or refinance.  \n  \nAnd, unless you buy a shitty variable product, P&amp;I are fixed for the life of the loan, so those parts get better with inflation.  And you might get lucky with a property value increase beyond the principal you pay down (though you might also lose money on your property if the value goes down).  \n  \nUltimately, the reason to own a home is control / freedom.  You control, to the extent allowed by your city and HOA, what you do with a place you own.  You reap the benefits from any improvements, albeit you pay the costs as well.  On the other hand, you lose freedom of movement.  \n  \nI don't recommend anyone buy or rent for financial reasons.  I recommend renting when young in a career, or when single but planning to marry, or childless but planning to start a family, so that you have the flexibility to move when your needs change.  I recommend buying when you want to control the place where you live.",

            "comment": "Added costs to owning a home beyond upkeep which is significant, even on new houses is mortgage insurance, property insurance and depending on where you live, that's huge.  Property taxes.  For example, I'm in Texas, my house is paid off, so no mortgage/insurance, but my property insurance is $3500 a year and going up $500 a year (gone up $500 each year I've been here now), and my property taxes are an astronomical $8500 a year and also going up.\n\nI would rent.  A house is an amazing investment if you do end up buying low and selling high.  If not, it's a miserable money pit and very difficult to get out of.  If you stay under 2 years, you have to pay taxes on whatever you get out of it (if anything).  If you stay over two years, you don't have to pay taxes on whatever you make on the house as long as you reinvest it into a new home.  I'm oversimplifying things, but making the point there's way more to it than signing a rental agreement and dealing with utilities like an apartment.\n\nFind a good little place, do your research, save up as much money as you can, and move when you can comfortably cover your mortgage + maintenance + taxes/insurance every year.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Also something important to add, the market is in a bubble right now.  While property values may still increase for the short term, it's inevitable it'll come down.  The numbers just aren't sustainable, and in certain markets we've already seen this happening.  I would absolutely as I've mentioned wait.  You could end up saving yourself a lot of money up front, and making a lot of money on the back end after it appreciates again.  Also, you'll inevitably get a better property for the same amount of money.  Spend 150k now on something smaller and in need of work, or spend 150k later on a property that has more and costs the same.\n\nWhen I moved out of Oregon 2 years ago, I had bought my house in 2015 for $172k.  It was 970sq ft, 5k sqft property, 3 bed 1 bath and it was oooold.  Good condition for its age, but I did a ton of work.\n\nFast forward to 2021, I sold that same house for 400k, bought my 3k sq ft, 50k sqft lot with 5 bedrooms, 3 bath, an office, in a wonderful non-hoa neighborhood and it's PAID OFF.  Now that said, a lot of good fortune had to happen to get there.  Just make smart decisions and you'll be set.  Also, being you're a carpenter, maybe you'll end up wanting a house with a few small issues to bring the price down to where you can invest sweat equity to make it better.\n\nGood Luck!",

Thinking long term, you could even rent it out once you feel more comfortable buying a SFH.  Construction can be hard on the body (as I am sure you know). A good long-term plan for a person in such a profession would be to buy properties to rent, retiring at some point and living on the rental income. As a bonus, you would be able to do the carpentry work and will have contacts and knowledge amongst the other trades. That last part might be fantasy: do carpenters talk to the electricians, the HVAC people etc. or do you all have your separate domains?",

During that, my furnace went out, which was another $4000. In February my sidewalk got marked for replacement, which was another $2000. Just yesterday my neighbor informed me that my tree that is encroaching his property is dead and will need to be cut down. That\u2019s another $2000 minimum. My water heater desperately needs replaced, which DIY will be about $600. \n\nAlso, my house is around the same price as what you\u2019re looking for. Don\u2019t forget internet, utilities, garbage which will be another $200-300/month and taxes if they\u2019re not included in your estimate which can range wildly from city to city.\n\nIf you\u2019re only 20, I would recommend renting until you\u2019re sure a house is a good decision for you.

I made $18/hr ($21 basically)/in WV, well above what people got paid. Easily got approved for $160k. Had roughly 20k to drop on a house that was $180k. I worked with a fantastic Loan Officer, found a couple houses. Found an amazing house for 178k, got the guy to come down to 168k, would of have him 10k cash so it would of been sub-160k for the FHA approval. I had a hang up as I need 1 year with a credit card. That would of come End of March/Beginning of April 2020. The house was 2800sqft, downtown, across from the hospital, down the street from the track. 5b4b. Two of the rooms where set up with apartments, and my mortgage would of been no more than $900/month w/ $78 property tax. Rent for a room was 500-600, a h9ouse was going for 800-1200. The property is worth 298k now.",

You have to furnish it, pay for utilities, put money aside for insurance and taxes (which may be included with your mortgage, know that that amount goes up every year), put money aside for unforeseen breakdowns, leaky roof/pipe, refrigerator breaking, etc.  That is on top of the mortgage.  Oh, and then there is yard work.\n\nIf you are unsure, rent an apartment, where you know that your monthly rent is going to cover all those things (well, maybe not all the utilities, sometimes they are included, sometimes not).  Invest the money you have saved.    Look around, decide what you want.  Don\u2019t let anyone pressure you into a decision you are not sure of.",

Homes can be investments and owning has been a good investment in recent years. That doesn't mean it's not a dee0ly personal choice or that homes will always be good investments for that matter. \n\nWhile it's important to consider finances in buying a home the personal dimensions are more important in my opinion. It has to be a good personal decision. \n\nI owned a single family home and hated it more or less. I don't like home improvement or yard work. There is always some expense coming up, etc. We were sort of trapped by the sanity of the Seattle housing market. We eventually found a condo in a location that suits us much better. That might be a good option for you should you want to own. Ownership, less maintenance, our building still has repair and maintenance people for building issues. Basically the big things plumbing, windows, doors balconies, common areas, etc. It's a nice in-between between renting and owning.\n\nIn any case don't let other people tell you what you should want.",

    "postText": "I just sold my company and don't know where to put the money.\n\nAge: 35\n\nJust sold my company, I have a little over 2 million in cash.\n\nI am very simple person. I don't want some complicated allocation scheme.\n\nJust wondering if there is anywhere I can put that money to make $10k per month, is that a stretch?\n\nI would want to be able to get paid 10k per month so maybe an ETF or something like that?\n\nBuy a piece of real estate cash and rent it out? Where I am located this is possible (live in a very touristy area in hawaii)\n\nAgain, I'm not really trying to maximize or do the most efficient thing, I am mostly after simplicity. Having to manage a portfolio of stocks and investments isn't something I care to spend my time doing.",

You have an amount that could build enough momentum to not just last but grow. There are many good books on the subject, get a few.\n\nDo you plan on working? Basically any occupation that pays the bills would let that money grow unmolested and at a much higher rate. I have a 40% savings rate off my gross income which means I could afford to make a lot less doing something a lot more fun, if it wasn't for the fact that I need to accumulate money for retirement.\n\nAlso, take a long hard look at your insurance; most people do not get sued because frankly there isn't much to go after, which is not your case. Look at umbrella coverages that go up to the amount of your total wealth. This type of coverage pays your liability, in case someone sues. You should also scrutinize your medical coverage, it is ridiculous how easy it can be to rack $100k in medical bills because you were unconscious and the ambulance took you to a hospital outside of your plan.",

You don't care about the nominal numbers, what you want is purchasing power. Failing to understand this will cost you dearly.\n\nSo if you have a 6% return but inflation in the same period of time was 4%, your real profit, the increase in your purchasing power, was 2% not 6.\n\nThen you have to substract fees/commissions, and taxes. I don't think you're at a level where you can afford not being concerned about inflation, 2M cash is not early retirement money.",

Offering you a couple ideas.  \n\n\nYou could get close to 100k a year with CDs or bonds and that kinda thing. But you'll underperform the market in the long run most likely - also if interest rates drop this will cease to provide the same level of income. And in 20 years 100k a year won't be what it is today.  \n\n\nYou could do conservative dividend growth. Things like consumer staples and utilities. You'd have income then that slowly goes up but the starting yield might be a tad less. The benefit there is your income can go up without you having to sell anything or buy anything new. But it would require you to understand the underlying businesses reasonably well to make intelligent choices.  \n\n\nFor $2,000,000 it's worth studying and learning what strategy would most closely align with your long term goals. Once you figure that out it can be mostly hassle free with minimal time/effort needed on your part to maintain it.",

In 10 years, or 20 years, or 30 years, you\u2019ll still have $2M which will be worth way less than if you had allowed that to grow instead of spending all of the interest. And that $10K per month will also be worth less with each passing year. \n\nMy advice would be to continue working, but potentially at something that you enjoy but is less lucrative, so that you can maybe only spend half of the interest and allow the rest to continue to grow. My guess is that you will find yourself bored relatively quickly anyway.\n\nIf I were you and did not want to \u201cwork\u201d anymore I would take that $2M and leverage it to buy $6-$8 million worth of commercial property that I would manage myself. You should be able to pay yourself $10K and still service a mortgage. Depending on the numbers, you might even be able to hire a property management company and still net the $10K. The property will appreciate overtime, rents will increase with inflation, and the rental income will pay off the mortgage. Obviously, you can have down economic times, you can have vacancies, you can have repair costs, but I think overtime that would be the best investment for you.",

I've casually looked at them in the past (currently self-managing), and they want to take several percent off of your monthly rent for themselves ... but since you wouldn't have a mortgage payment to make if you bought these for cash, it might not be as big of a deal.\n\nOther benefit - in theory over the long term (since you are only 35) homes should appreciate in value.  So maybe in 20 years you get out of the rental landlord game and do something else.  However, there's always general inflation too.\n\nYou could also do a mix.  $1m in real-estate that pays income.  $1m in stock market investments of some sort (see my other top-level comment for you).",

They take a 0.25% fee. \n\nYou could hire a financial advisor, by the hour, and have them tell you what to do. Do not pay a percentage. \n\nOr you can go to a managed portfolio with a big bank like Merrill Lynch. You will pay a % of the portfolio every year. \n\nYou can also give me the $2m and get your 10k per month, guaranteed until I decide to steal the money. Ok that one is a joke..",

            "comment": "So there's been this interesting class of \"covered call ETF\" funds floating around lately - QYLD, SPYI, etc.  Basically, paying annual dividends of like 10%+ which would get you there.\n\nHowever, I am highly suspicious of their long-term performance ... because you want *capital preservation* as well.  What they do is have a bunch of S&amp;P 500 stocks, and then they sell covered calls against them as income.  If the calls expire worthless, then the fund keeps the call premium for themselves.  I've done it with a few individual stocks I own, and it's kind of fun to pluck $2,000 out of the market from time to time with the only risk being that my shares may get called away from me (but I'm always writing my options at a price where I'm content with getting out of that stock at that price anyway).\n\nAnyhoo, if the fund guesses right all of the time - I could see where high yields would be sustainable.  But no one guesses right all the time.  So what happens to the principal when they got their covered call position wrong and some of the shares are called away?  Now there are fewer underlying assets to write against.  The fund will eventually have to buy more.\n\nWould love to hear from others here on why the covered call ETFs are risky, because they sound too good to be true.\n\nStill, maybe $500,000 in one of those, $1m in rentals, $500,000 in more traditional high-dividend stocks ... would get you there.",

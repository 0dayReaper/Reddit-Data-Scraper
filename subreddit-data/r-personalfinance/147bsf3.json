The BAH *RATE* is dependent on where you currently live, or technically, your HOR -**Home Of Record**.\n\nThere are subs on reddit specific to your branch which may yield more answers to specific questions.\n\nBut to answer your specific question, you will get BAH, you don't have to do anything special to get it",

BAH is not guaranteed. As far as your question on saving, a deployment is a great opportunity for that. Create a budget geared towards pocketing as much of that as possible\u2014ideally through allotments or automatic withdrawals so it\u2019s a set and forget type deal.",

    "postText": "I'm 19 and have saved up 27k dollars and I'm looking for some advice on what I could invest some of the money on. My expenses are only around $500 a month as my parents dont want me to move out and pay 1k+ for rent. Income is $1k a month on a part time job plus extra income on side hustles ranging from an extra $2000-10000 a month and only $3k in debt from an atv i financed to help my credit. What is a good way to safely invest that isn't too risky.",

Now imagine how much you could have if you maxed it out again the following year. And so on.\n\nCompound interest is powerful. This should be numero uno on your list for what to do with this money. Set your future self up. And never touch the money until you\u2019re ready to retire; it\u2019s essentially robbing from future you.",

You need 53 years of growth at 10% to turn $6500 into $1M. \n\nAlso, $1M isn't worth the same in 53 years due to inflation, so the common correction is to just assume ~7% market growth rate instead, and measure everything in dollars from the year it was invested.\n\nSo $6500 invested at age 20 in 2023 would be $473k at age 65 in 2068. That would be about $137k in 2023 dollars.",

It is safe to plan for this to rise closer to 70 in the coming decades as the government decides how to better keep the program solvent. There have already been lawmakers calling for increases over the past decade or two as this problem has become more understood. This would mean the reduced benefit (70% payout) age could one day be 65.\n\n[What Raising the Retirement Age to 70 Would Mean](https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/social-security/articles/what-raising-the-retirement-age-to-70-would-mean-for-social-security)\n\nSS payout is supposed to be adjusted to cost of living increases over time, year over year. We are already seeing examples of where the way they calculate the adjustment is not indicative of everyone\u2019s situation, but rather an average across the country. If you\u2019re in a major city in retirement, you\u2019re going to have a hard time living on SS",

You can still buy other brokers' funds with it, you're not locked into Fidelity-only funds.\n\nAs for what to invest in: Target-Date Funds. If you don't know what you're doing, these do all the work for you. They track a broad-market index so your risk is distributed across the entire stock market, and invest aggressively while you're young and able to ride out stock market noise. As you get closer to retirement age, they'll add in bonds, which lower the return-on-investment but are far safer so a stock market crash won't tank your portfolio 1 year before you plan to retire.\n\nLook for a TDF that has a low expense ratio (how much the fund manager charges you to manage the fund, you should be able to find plenty below 0.1%), and tracks a broad index. S&amp;P 500 is fine, but there are plenty that do total market index which includes small companies as well (wouldn't it have been great to buy a little bit of Amazon when they were a tiny company?).\n\n[Here are Vanguard's Target Date Funds](https://institutional.vanguard.com/fund-list/?filters=trgDt,&amp;sortBy=assetClass&amp;viewType=quarterEndReturnsNAV). Pick the one closest to the year you turn 65, as that's a good retirement date to work with until you're a little closer and have a better view of what your retirement picture is like.",

Throw it in something like VFIAX or VIGAX (check those out) to mimic the stock market, or a target retirement year fund if you want to mitigate risk a bit. \n\nYou have an incredible head start, and if you start now and put that shit on auto, you\u2019re golden. \n\nLearn about compound interest, if you haven\u2019t already. Look up a time value of money calculator (or future value), plug in the numbers, play with it a bit, and you\u2019ll see the absolute power of it and how much of a head start you have.",

Most investments are also taxed, just in different ways. \n\nIf you spend all your money, you'll be in a very sore spot when the IRS audits you. \n\nIRS is paying attention to even deposits of over $600 now. \n\nIf you want to live a \"cash is king\" life by dealing in automotives, you're looking at a very different way of life. You've already put it in the bank, it's already too late to be cash only. You HAVE to file taxes. \n\nSee if you have any family members that can walk you through it. If you knew your personal finance teacher in high school well, maybe you can swing by their classroom and ask for general tips.\n\nAbout 30% of your money should be set aside to pay taxes. Working a regular job with a W-2 makes it easy- taxes are taken out every paycheck. Running your own side business is harder. You have to factor in business expenses (write off parts you've bought for cars, paint, equipment/tools, keep all receipts for years in case of IRS audits)\n\nYou will need advice and research to properly file taxes this year. Without giving us a ton of details, we cannot give you that advice here. \n\nGood luck and welcome to adulthood. I'm 24 and own a house and make a decent amount of money but still fuckin hate taxes and get nervous when filing.",

After that, maybe put it in a HYSA until you figure out how stable this side hustle will be - do it for another 4-6 months and see how much you can actually make on the regular. If you\u2019re sustainably making enough to do $40-50k a year, I\u2019d drop your $1k/mo job. \n\nConsider saving for tuition and getting a degree in something useful like business, sales, tech, finance. If you can make $40-50k/yr in side hustles you are probably smart enough to get in to a 6 figure salaried job in sales or finance or really whatever you want. And you\u2019re making enough to be able to save and pay for tuition to a state school, so I\u2019d do that. Good luck!",

I'd pay it off after a year. Then I'd pick up another small loan. \n\nIf you intend on taking ANY additional debt on, pay off that ATV first. \n\nGet a credit card and make SMALL purchases monthly (well under 10% card utilization - I buy candy from the gas station) to build credit. Pay it off in full every month on time. \n\nCredit is better than any cash. Debts are good if financed properly. Using other people's money is good if financed properly. Better than living in all cash. \n\nI'd rather marry a man with an 800 credit score than a man who brings home $100k+ from under the table cash transactions. Credit will get you what you want as an adult. A house mortgage, a car loan, an emergency loan. Cash and no credit will get you denied from apartments, rental equipment , utility deposits, or have huge deposits if they even choose to rent something to you. Will keep costing you cash.",

You select a broad index based ETF like SPY (S&amp;P 500) or VT - Vanguard Total World Index. SPY and VT are the tickers - they trade like stocks but contain many stocks within them weighted by market cap. ETF = Exchange Traded Fund.  \n\n\nOr - Put it in a high yield savings. You can get like 4% or 5% in some cases. This is FDIC insured and a good way to not lose value while you actually learn more about what you'd be investing in by buying ETFs, stocks, mutual funds or whatever.  \n\n\nSome people prefer a different approach than the index fund investing approach. You're unlikely to beat the market with your own strategy, but I think you owe it to yourself to understand what the underlying thing is you're actually owning if you do go with the standard advice and buy ETFs.",

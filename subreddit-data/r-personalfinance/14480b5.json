    "postText": "Basically the title, someone was sending money through so-fi and I didn\u2019t realize I could just scroll down and accept it. Went through the whole process of providing all info. \nI went to customer support and asked to deactivate/cancel my account and they were a little sketchy. I did receive a credit card in the mail a few days later (I think it was sent before I cancelled). \n\nI haven\u2019t touched the card, activated or even taken it out of the paper. Am I okay to leave it as is?",

            "comment": "Yeah, it sounds like you unwittingly applied for a credit card. Calling and canceling the account afterwards didn't prevent it from being opened; it just closed it after a very brief time. The card was likely triggered to be mailed as soon as the account was opened and their system isn't set up to intercept or stop it from being mailed when the account is closed before it's mailed, since that's probably a very rare occurrence. If it were me, I would call or log in to SoFi and verify that the account is in fact closed, and then cut up the card and throw it away.",

            "comment": "I reformatted and cleaned this up with some computer assistance. Please keep comments helpful and respectful, thanks!\n\n---\n\nHello everyone, I'm gonna try to keep this simple. I'm a 25-year-old male who makes around $45k a year, living with my dad in our family business. I don't have to pay rent because I am on good terms with my family. I had $28k in my bank account with savings and another $10k invested into crypto on Robinhood. I've always been a fan of Tesla. I liked their cars and always wanted to get one for myself because I thought it was an awesome car. So once I found out about the EV tax credit and the Tesla dropped prices, I went ahead and pulled the trigger and ordered a Tesla Model Y Performance. In total, the car, after taxes and fees, was $52,000 (based in Jersey, there is no sales tax for electric cars in Jersey).\n\nSo, I own a Chevy car that is valued at $6,000 for a trade-in, and a Ninja 650 motorcycle that is new I can sell for $7,000 if I wanted to put it towards the car. So, in my head, I was okay if I take the $56,000 and subtract $7,000 for my bike, $6,000 for the car, and $7,500 for the tax credit, I would owe $35,500. And if I put down half of my savings towards a car, which would be an additional $14,000, I would only have to finance $21,500. I was like, okay, that's not bad. I was given a 1-2 month delivery after I placed the order.\n\nAbout 2 weeks after ordering the car, I started running into problems with my family business and getting distracted mentally and dealing with other minor life problems. I was like, \"everything will be okay, soon I will have my brand new Tesla and everything will be okay, and it will make me happy again.\" About 3 days later or 3 weeks after I purchased the car, I get a call from Tesla that someone recently canceled their pickup for the same car I bought, and they said it could be ready in 2 days if I wanted it. I was like, hell yeah, I'll take it. Then it hit me that I still didn't sell my motorcycle or car. I planned on selling my car privately because the car is in my father's name and I am the co-signer, so he had to be there to trade it in.\n\nAfter I submitted the Tesla loan application, I got approved for a minimum $10k down payment with a 7.5 percent APR with my 700 credit score. I was excited about getting my car, so I was more worried about getting it than dealing with other problems first. So, I ended up putting only $10k down because I talked to my dad, and he said I could refinance down the line with a credit union to get a better rate. So, I was like, okay, I'll just put $10k down for now and take the high payment of $780 a month, plus an additional $115 a month for car insurance. I still have to sell my car and my motorcycle and wait for the tax credit to refinance if I want a lower rate. Or, I could borrow the tax credit from my dad and pay him back when he gets it.\n\nBut now, after 3 days of owning the car, all I feel is guilt and shame for buying something I don't need. I went from paying $0 rent to $900 a month for a car that I didn't need but only liked because I think it's cool. The car purchase has been messing with me mentally ever since I bought it. The guilt, remorse, and anxiety of having to pay all this money while still trying to sell my car and my bike and waiting another 6 months for the tax credit is getting to my head. I have trouble sleeping ever since I got it. I can't stop feeling mad at myself for a dumb decision because I don't actually like the car as much as I thought I would. It's way too fast for me and a little too large, and the bright white color I thought I liked at first, I no longer do. I just wish I can return it and go back a week in my life. I don't know what to do with this car.\n\nI guess my only way is to sell the car to Carmax or Vroom, something like that, in hopes they would pay me enough to pay off the $46,000 loan. And hopefully, if I still qualify for the tax credit, by the time I get it, I would only be down $2,500, which I don't mind paying for learning a valuable lesson. I really don't know what to do with this car. Does anyone have advice? Could I still get the tax credit if I sell the car a week after buying it?",

Get out of your dad's house and live on your own and learn how to budget and plan.\n\nThe good news is that you have a car in high demand so you likely didn't lose as much value driving it off the lot as you would with a lot of other cars.",

            "comment": "whew ok...this stressed me out just reading this.\n\nFirst, next time you do a reddit post, try to do it on a computer instead of your phone. The lack of punctuation is a little much.\n\nOnto your main issue. You did not think this through. You bought a $52K Tesla on a $45K salary, and made several impulsive decisions along the way, but we'll come back to this in a second.\n\nSell your motorcycle (which also makes me sad cause I have a Ninja 650 and I know how fun it is to ride, but gotta do what you gotta do). Trade in your car. ASAP. Then yes, sell the car immediately. Try for a private market but if that takes too long, just go to a dealer. You will take a loss. But that is gonna be better than a $900+ payment on a car that you don't even want anymore.\n\nThen I would take some time to reflect on why you made such an impulsive purchase. Buying a car is a depreciating asset, so unless you are at a point financially where you can truly afford a new car, don't get a new car. Also Tesla's are not the only electric cars out there. It would behoove you to do more research before putting half your savings into the first thing you think of.\n\nOn that note:\n\n&gt;i had 28K in my bank account with savings and another 10k invested into crypto on robinhood.\n\nYou put $10K into crypto, a risky and speculative investment, but nothing in a Roth IRA? At the young age of 25 where compound interest alone will make you a millionaire? Dude...\n\nI would suggest watching some youtube videos on how to perform good money management, and please humble yourself next time. You can't afford a Tesla. Stay in your lane and refrain from keeping up with the Joneses.",

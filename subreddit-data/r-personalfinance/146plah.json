If you default on credit card debt, your credit gets damaged.  If you default on heloc debt, you can lose your house.\n\nJust buckle down, trim spending, and pay off your credit cards from income.",

As long as you already have a plan and are currently consistently paying down your credit card debt and feel comfortable with having additional credit but not using it, then I would do it \n\nIf you\u2019re going to be an straight up idiot and continue to not pay back your debt or spend more and go further into debt, then please do not do that. You can simply blow up your life\n\nAre you currently responsible and have been responsible. Did you already change your spending habits and will no longer ever get into credit card debt?\n\nIf you have not changed your life style and/or can keep it up, then a HELOC won\u2019t save you but only make it worse",

Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.\n\nThe banks are tightening lending requirements because the FED is raising interest rates. Refinancing and loan consolidation may not be available to you at this time.",

    "postText": "I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/11b0uzy/should_i_repair_or_replace_my_16_year_old_high/) before and decided to purchase a used car in the $10K range until I get rid of debt and build more savings. I am now trying to determine how much of a down payment I should make. Ideally, for a car that's 10+ years old, I would pay in full but that would wipe out most if not all of my savings at this time. I would try to hold out longer but it's rainy season where I live and water leaks through the moon roof.\n\nUpdated Financial Info:\n\nMy take-home pay is $4,600/mo after 401k, insurance, and taxes. My wife is a freelancer so her income is variable but she sends me $1,000/mo and is working on increasing her income in the coming months. Our mortgage is $1,400/mo but will likely increase this summer due to rising insurance rates. Monthly bills come out to around $600. We have $5,400 in CC debt (0% APR for another 11 months), $12K debt consolidation loan at 7.17% APR ($340/mo) and federal student loans. I have $12,300 in a HYSA ($5,000 emergency fund + adding \\~$650 each month to pay off CCbefore intro APR period is over) and another $27K across my 401k &amp; IRA.\n\nI'd like to pay down $5,000 and finance the rest for 36 months but I worry that wouldn't leave me with enough liquidity.\n\nThank you in advance for any advice.",

            "comment": "If the APR on the car loan is less than the APR on your debt consolidation loan, you should put down as little as possible and use the money you could use for a down payment to instead pay down the consolidation loan. If they're about the same it's a wash. If the car loan is more, sure put more down if you want.\n\nYou emergency fund is ok but not in *great* shape yet, so I'd prioritize building that up over a down payment. You can pay down the car aggressively later if you want. If you're worried about being underwater, get gap insurance.",

I'll certainly keep this in mind.\n\nHow much of an emergency fund do you think I should build before tackling debt? My plan has been to save 6 months of expenses eventually, but keep it at \\~$5K until my higher interest debt is paid off.",

Which if you put $5k into the car you won't have.\n\nAt 8% for 36 months, putting that $5k down is a difference in total cost of like $650, and when you factor in the money you could earn on interesting keeping that $5k in the bank, it's almost the same. (This isn't *quite* an apples-to-apples comparison, but it's close. The point is the down payment really doesn't save you that much unless it gets you much better loan terms.)",

Honestly I would get a 5,000 dollar car that you can pay for in cash. Sending the would be monthly payments to pay off the debt. There is a different in a 5K car vs a 10K car. But I don\u2019t think they are gonna be significant in your situation since your top goal is getting out of debt.",

I've seen a few closer to $5K but they have closer to 200-300K miles and are being sold by shadier used car lots. I'm worried that if I go too low, I'll just end up with another car that needs a ton of repairs before I'm ready to upgrade.",

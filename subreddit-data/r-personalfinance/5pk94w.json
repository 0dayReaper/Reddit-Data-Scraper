    "postText": "The bill was being autopaid on his credit card. I think he was aware he was paying it (I'm assuming), but not sure that he really knew why. Or he forgot about it as I don't believe he receives physical bills in the mail and he autopays everything through his card.\n\nHe's actually super smart financially. Budgets his money, is on track to retire next year (he's 56 now), uses a credit card for all his spending for points, and owns approximately 14 rental properties. \n\nI don't think he's used dial up for at least the last 10....15 years? Anything he can do other than calling and cancelling now?\n\nEDIT: AOL refused to refund anything as I figured, and also tried to keep on selling their services by dropping the price when he said to cancel. \n\nI got a little clarification on the not checking his statement thing: He doesn't really check his statements. Or I guess he does, but not in great detail. My dad logs literally everything in Quicken, so when he pays his monthly credit card bill (to which he charges pretty much everything to) as long as the two (payment due and what he shows for expenses in Quicken) are close he doesn't really think twice. He said they've always been pretty close when he compares the two so he didn't give it second thought. ",

If you do, it locks the CSR out of the account and you can't get anything back. You MIGHT be able to get a years worth of AOL refunded back to your card, but I wouldn't hope for much more.\n\nDear God if there was ever a time you read all the comments to your post...let it be this.",

This isn't a story of a father who tried to cancel his subscription and it didn't go through, or someone who was tricked into paying through shady business practices. This is just someone who assumed he was paying AOL for a reason and didn't bother to check into it. I think it's fair to ask for a refund and it would be honorable for AOL to grant one in light of the fact that their records probably show he wasn't using it. But pretending your dad has Alzheimer's is just straight up lying. Not saying any of you all are bad people, but this sort of thing has an impact on our relationship with companies. When I taught undergrads, I hated that when I heard a sob story about a family member being ill, my first reaction was skepticism. But too many people will just say anything and you put up your defenses.",

This usually involved sending people copies of her death certificate so they would believe us that she had died.\n\nAOL was the only company that wouldn't accept her death certificate. They demanded that we give them her account password or they refused to shut down her account. Since we didn't have the password, they kept billing her credit card.\n\nI'll skip all the letters and phone calls my dad used to try and end the madness - eventually, he called the credit card company. They said they couldn't simply block one company from charging, but they Could create a new credit card and transfer any Other charges over to the new card (car insurance etc) while leaving AOL to charge the defunct number. We readily agreed. Soon, AOL was sending us angry letters and collection notices with late fees and penalties applied. Because they wanted money from my dead mother for the Internet she wasn't using.\n\nWhen AOL finally gave up, they forwarded our account to a debt collector... who contacted us once and then stopped upon realizing mom was dead and we didn't even want the service.\n\nI will never forget the final letter AOL sent us, after more than a year of fighting....\n\n\"If you do not pay in full Immediately... your account will be terminated.\"",

She kept procrastinating on joining and I was just being encouraging, and had no real interest in going. I didn't realize that the deal for her required both of us to sign up but not be billed for a month. I just did it then would figure it out later.\n\nI then figured out that all I had to do was go online and freeze my account, I think you had to do it every three months until they unfroze it. I couldn't cancel without paying anything, so eventually I got a different card that they couldn't bill.",

They ended up charging me for two more months.\n\nA second gym I considered signing up for assured me that I could cancel if need be just by calling them, just initial here. No thanks, learned my lesson with the last contract - theirs read the same. Handwritten letter, priority mail, long cancellation process. \n\nI just started buying my own equipment.",

Im all set?\" When I don't try to fuck them over constantly.\n\nI used to run clubs for someone else who would TELL us to throw out any letter than arrived without signature Conf so he could milk extra months out of people (among many other things). It pisses me off and Im slowly gaining a reputation that Im actually a good guy, hence opening the second club. I had a woman who joined w her husband call me a month later saying her husband died. Technically, its a ~$250 early cancel fee (half remaining balance on contract) but I just told her that I was going to just write off the acct.\nI Ended up having a few of my training employees and myself help her shovel out her driveway cause her husband used to (dead of winter) so she could get to her session (she called saying she was snowed in and couldn't make it).\n\nTl/Dr: most gym owners are scumbags - but some of us try to change that!",

This sort of short-term profit BS gives their customers no other choice but to leave. AOL could have regained her, or her family, as customers later on in their lives. ",

The system will just check some numbers and wether the money is in or not, it will compare dates and send a letter on a billing date according to the system check. Letter can be anything from a new bill to a cancellation warning.\n\n(Phone/e-mail) Customerservice people have very little power and can rarely give any kind of real compensation and they have to play by the rules they are given. The computer system doesn't allow them to make significant changes. They also have to serve you as quickly as possible because they have strict time limits and quotas to meet. The situation is even much worse if the customerservice is outsourced. The information and requests slow down, things dissappear and are forgotten, a lot of stuff needs confirmation from the client which may be in a different country.\n\n Best option is always to send a written reclamation with documents backing your case. This way it always shifts up in customerservice power ladder till it reaches a person who has authority to make things right, it's not fast but will eventually happen. \n\nI'm not trying to defend any company or customerservice with above statements, just saying that usually the system just sucks. And I don't believe it will change a lot because changes and better service cost money. The bigger the company the harder it is to get quality customerservice\n\nSource: worked in customerservice for several years, allthough that was several years ago so maybe things have changed. And face to face service works in different way.\n\nI'm very sorry you had to go trough that experience. Most people who recieved the calls will feel bad and cruel too. These kinds of things haunt you from work to home and are pretty common.",

Most people continued to pay for AOL, even without using any of the paid services because they still \"used it for email\" by logging into webmail on another browser.  AOL didn't put forth any real effort to cancel these types of subscribers and still make a lot of money off people that haven't canceled. I think there's an ethical line there\n\nDo your friends/family a favor, if you see they use AOL email ask them if they pay for it. I've had at least 3 separate people have to cancel",

You can at anytime ask for manager and they have to connect the call to a manager.\n\n\n\n\n-They will refund an amount instantly but mostly will need to verify said shady actions before giving a full actual refund.\n\n\n\n\n- If they put the charge back on her statement call and bitch until they actually investigate the issue.\n\n\n\nEdit: Spelling....lots....and I probably still missed some.",

I returned my modem, but it didn't get logged or something. \n\nSo, I called up, was nice, got ahold of a manager, who saw there was zero usage, he contacted his superior to waive the billing, and they sent me a check for $1000+.\n\nIt wasn't Comcast.\n\nGCI in Alaska. Largest provider in the state, though that isn't saying much. They still have good customer service at this scale. And although they could have dicked me over for a thousand dollars, that act has kept me as a customer. I now have all my services through GCI. Top tier internet, and two phone plans. They've made the money back, and everyone is happy.",

These offices are required to have extensive backup batteries on standby and generators that can be turned on very quickly. \n\nPlain old telephone service (POTS) is amazing. It is also very heavily regulated, and steps are taken to ensure fairness and transparency. You can get POTS for under $15 a month in most states, and you can get the service just about anywhere. In most places phone companies simply are not allowed to not serve - the deal is that you serve the whole area if you want any of it. \n\nWithout the regulation you might have to pay more money to call Dominos, but Pizza Hut calls are free. Or you might have to pay a flat fee of $5 extra per month to make calls to Costco because they did not pay the phone company and Wal-Mart did. Or you might not even be able to call American Express because VISA paid for an exclusive. ",

Then it was up to the customer to talk to AOL and cancel their service if they went to another provider to get faster internet.  So OP wouldnt get the full money back, as the service is still being provided to the customer, even if they dont use it.

You spend time building up a comfort zone with your tech, and then someone comes along and is like \"yo, this is way better.\" It's hard to see how it could be. You put in the time and figured out how to best use your thing to its fullest potential, so why change?\n\nI can't even imagine how weird it must have been to have been born in the fifties, and by the time you are in your 60s nearly every facet of life has changed drastically, mostly because of some electric thing you never even heard about until well into highschool, and never used until your 30s. I'm sure there will be revolutionary tech to come out in the next 30 years, but I highly doubt anything could come out that would rival the computer in terms of pure, global scale change. It will happen eventually, but probably not in my life time. ",

Post a copy of his usage and billing on AOL's twitter or facebook page and hope for fall-out.  Also email a copy of the twitter post to the CEO's address (believe it or not - this ABSOLUTELY works with some CEOs).\n\n(5) Contact your credit card company and explain (a) you cancelled, (b) there was no auto renew, (c) you thought the $30 was for other services (come up with something credible).

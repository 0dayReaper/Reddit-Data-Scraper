    "postText": "Went out to eat on Memorial Day, bill was 38.XX, I tipped $10,  when the server reran my card to close out for the night she added a $4,600 tip.  She mistakenly keyed in my order number instead of the tip amount.  Restaurant has fully admitted fault, but say it\u2019s now with their credit card processor to reverse the charge.  I\u2019ve filed a dispute with my bank, which was initially denied, but I\u2019ve since been able to reopen by providing the receipt.  They say the investigation could take weeks, do I have any other recourse here?  I had a few grand in savings but other than that I'm basically paycheck to paycheck so this has been financially devastating to say the least.\n\nUS if that matters",

There was really no need to also initiate a chargeback and that will likely just be closed when the refund goes through, but could also slow down the refund process, people have posted about money getting locked up while that process completed.\n\nAssuming they initiated the refund Thursday or Friday it likely will go through tomorrow.",

Explain that you see a charge you don\u2019t recognize, and \u201cwant to double check before initiating a chargeback.\u201d  They may ask for the charge date, amount, and the last 4 digits of your card.

Especially in the case of an obvious fat-finger mistake like this. It delays their refund by months, and hits the merchant with a $20 fee, both of which could have been avoided with a five minute phone call.",

They should also have had a means of fronting OP a little bit of money from the upcoming refund. Also, if the initial authorization was for $38, why was a final charge of $4600 even processed? I thought some part of the financial system would reject too high of a tip amount in relation to the base transaction for this very reason...\n\nMany layers of failure here, but OP is not at fault for not understanding how our convoluted financial system works.",

He then went and disputed the transaction with his bank. Disputes are only for when a merchant refuses to correct an issue. That was not the case here. \n\nOften, when a transaction is disputed, it locks up that transaction. This means it could take longer for OP to receive his refund from the merchant bc the bank still needs to investigate his dispute/chargeback. It typically will take a bank longer to investigate a chargeback than it does for a merchant refund to be completed. \n\nSo, OP made the issue more complicated than it needed to be and it may very well take him longer, than it otherwise would have, to get his money back.

Sucks for OP but just have to wait it out til the credit card company figured it all out and refunds the balance to you.\nThis is another example of why not to use ur bank atm card and to just use a normal credit card, where you can dispute charges and not have it effect ur bank account balance.",

That puts them on spot to deny your claim or given you a provisional credit in 10 days or less. \n\nFiling a claim should not interfere with a refund unless these companies don\u2019t understand how the card networks work. That is a possibility, but ultimately the dispute should not make things take longer. In fact issuing a refund or providing proof of a prior refund are both valid ways to resolve a dispute. \n\nThis charge was a settled charge, not pending. That\u2019s how restaurant tips work.  The actual bill becomes pending when the run your card, they then \u201csettle\u201d for the final amount with tip. So this charge can be disputed and was a settled/final charge. \n\nYour bank should have been smart enough to not post this charge and disputed it themselves for lack of authorization. The restaurant can only settle +/- 20% of the original authorized amount in these circumstances, anything beyond that does not have to be honored. \n\nIf the restaurant actually sends a reversal of the transaction, it should post to your account pretty quickly (1-2 days). The long times to post being mentioned by other users is because the charge hasn\u2019t settled and most merchants don\u2019t reverse authorizations (even though the card networks support doing it). I\u2019d assume that the merchant either hasn\u2019t or doesn\u2019t know how to reverse your transaction or has a POS system or processor not set up to make a reversal easy.",

Humans key wrong amounts quite a bit and banks get final say to approve/decline the amount keyed wrong credited back to your account. Cash is always best!

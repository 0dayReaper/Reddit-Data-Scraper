    "postText": "Hi need some advice what is the best approach for auto insurance. This is my first time owning a car.\n\nMy husband (37M) and I (38F) are buying our first car. We both have our license since 18 and never owned a car and still inexperienced drivers. I know females get cheaper quotes so I'm registering the car under my name so I can be the primary driver under the auto insurance. We also just purchased a $1m house if that matters in any way.\n\n1) Should I register the car under my name even when I have 3x his net worth? I have over $1m in liquid assets while he only have $300k. I'm afraid I will get into a bad accident and get sued for everything I have.\n\n2) Should I add my husband to the insurance?\n\n3) Being inexperience drivers in NYC should we get full coverage or just a high liability?",

            "comment": "&gt; I'm afraid I will get into a bad accident and get sued for everything I have.\n\nYou should get an umbrella policy. Home+auto+umbrella (typically the same company is required for all policies though not always). If there is a significant accident, then any reasonable attorney will attempt to estimate your ability to pay, and if they determine that you have a lot of assets, then it's more likely they would take a case as it's more likely they will get paid. Also if you get a policy, don't advertise that fact. \n\n\nAn Umbrella policy is liability coverage on top of the typical underlying policy. The policies start at $1m and go up to $10m typically. My advice is to at least insure against your current assets and future earnings potential, probably $3-5m in your case. \n\nYour coverage should look something like this:\n\n* $300k liability on the auto policy at $900/year\n* $3MM umbrella liability at $600/year\n* $300k uninsured liability to pay yourself in a not-at-fault accident at $450/year\n* Disability insurance for 70% of your income, at $1200/year, to pay yourself if you are injured\n* Life insurance for 10-15x your income\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is that you are at fault *and* suffer a significant and disabling injury or one of you dies. You will owe the damages from the accident, which the umbrella will cover, and then you will also potentially lose your incomes. Disability and life are often forgotten in these situations, but if you are concerned about an accident, then you should look into these policies to see if they make sense for you.",

            "comment": "\n1)  you should buy high liability limits and an umbrella policy. \n\n\n\n2) almost every single company will require it. \n\n\n\n3) there's no standard definition of \"full coverage\" so no one can know what you mean by it. You should carry high liability limits because both the owner and driver of the car, even if they're not the same person, can be sued for damages caused. If you can't afford to easily repair or replace it whether you cause an at fault accident or someone without insurance (or enough insurance) hits you or is damaged by fire, vandalism, hail, a tree etc, then you should carry comp and collison. If it's no burden to repair/replace, then it's a personal choice whether to purchase comp/collision. Ive had clients keep that coverage on a car worth only 3k because it was so cheap, and I've had a client to remove the coverage on a 60k Cadillac Escalade.",

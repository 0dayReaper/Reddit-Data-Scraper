We also have about $21k in I-bonds, and about $10k in immediate liquid funds.\n\nBesides that, we have a 401k with about $200k, a 457b with $50k, a 403b with %20k, another 401k with about $40k, and a couple of other random 401ks with $8 - $10k in them too.\n\n- Are we taking a silly risk by just letting the majority of our savings accumulate in an online brokerage account (betterment) set to \"aggressive\"?\n- Are we missing out on economies of scale or compounding effects by having retirement savings scattered across all of these multiple different retirement accounts?\n- We are pretty risk-averse people. Are we taking any silly risks that we should think about changing before anything happens that we might regret?\n\nWe don't have any big bills or plans coming up, just three kids and the odd vacation every other year. Our plan is to simply pay off our mortgage, save and fund our retirement accounts.",

If any portion is in a Roth 401K roll it over into a Roth IRA.\n\nEven with your salaries, you can still invest in a Roth IRA via backdoor method.\n\nInvest in and max out health savings account (HSA) if you're eligible for one.",

    "postText": "I had a old 401k account sitting in a account that I could not contribute to. I opened an investment account with my bank and moved the 401k into a traditional IRA. I did this before I did any homework unfortunately. I work for a school with no 401k.  Plus I don\u2019t have the option to have money taken out of my pay pre-tax and put into the IRA. \n\nIs then any way to add pre-tax money to this IRA?  Is it fine to just leave it to grow as is without adding to it monthly?  I have it diversified. I have a Roth IRA also plus a brokerage account.  Should I move it to something else?   Not sure what the tax implications would be. \n\nThanks for any insight.",

You contribute to the traditional IRA after tax up to $6500 a year and when you file your taxes for thar year you can then deduct those contributions feom your income thus essentially converting them to pre-tax dollars.\n\nIf you are say in the 22% marginal tax bracket and contribute the full $6500 that would save you $1430 on your taxes.",

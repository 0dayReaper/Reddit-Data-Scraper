    "postText": "Hi, \n\nIn March, I noticed a charge on credit card from BEST BUY MHT 00001214. It took over $3000+ from me, and I wasn't in town for the purchase\n\nI called chase and they claimed it was done on my card I had \"probably saved\" on my laptop and someone hijacked it and they removed it the fraud. So, I decided to get a new credit card just in case. \n\nWeird thing is it was charged on an old card I had before it was expired, but it still showed up under my new credit cards number. \n\nFlashforward to end of May, I received a letter that during their investigation, it was made clear that it was me. I told them I wasn't in town, and they said that the card was used online. I still kept asking how was that card even charged when I have not been in possession of it since it was expired and it's not even on my Chase bank of cards I own so I'm confused. Then the guy kept going back and forth with me claiming it was charged on my new credit card not the one they claimed, so I am VERY confused.\n\nSo far, I have emailed them pcitures of transcation proofs I was not in town. \n\nNow for further proof, what should I do? Should I contact best buy for the charge? I looked up on my account made years ago and there was no charde under, so obviousy can't they track my card name and who ever's address? I need help please.",

OP specified a Credit Card, so this falls under Reg Z.\n\nStrictly speaking, Chase has substantially complied with the Reg Z error resolution requirements, they have purportedly conducted an investigation and concluded that no \u201cerror\u201d (fraud) occurred, then provided OP with written notice of the result of their investigation.\n\nThis is the angle I\u2019d take if filing a CFPB Complaint: State that after reviewing the materials returned by Chase informing you of the result of their investigation, you believe that they did not conduct a reasonable investigation. That should cause a review of the investigation and hopefully kick Chase to properly reverse the transaction. Particularly if Chase\u2019s investigators were simply looking for any excuse to deny the claim.\n\nThe other option that may be available depends on the exact timing. Chase has 2 \u201cComplete Billing Cycles\u201d, but not more than 90 days to complete their investigation. I know that chase credit cards run monthly cycles, so the timing could be key here. If OP received 2 statements between the time that they reported the dispute and the time he received the investigation result notice from Chase, they could argue that the reversal is barred under Reg Z.",

I had this happen with a recurring fraudulent subscription put on my debit card. My bank suggested replacing the card. So I did. Subscription charged again the next month to the new card.\n\nAfter this happened with ANOTHER new card, my banker eventually figured out that it was Mastercard's fault.  They issue the card number, and not my bank. So they \"helpfully\" pass the number on to certain vendors in case you forget to update the payment information.\n\nAfter trying and failing to get Mastercard to stop passing the information on, I had to close the bank account and open a new one at the same bank so nothing from Mastercard from the debit card would be linked to the new bank account number.

I said I didn't purchase anything, so they cancelled the transaction, and told me which card it was. There were a bunch of other transactions. I called Amex to dispute them, the merchant disputed my dispute. They played back the phone purchase, which was done on a recorded line, and it was my voice completing the purchase. I explained to them that voices are easy to fake over the phone, so they had me get a police report. No one ever investigated anything, but all charges were removed after the police report. I use the Chase Sapphire Reserve card just because it's amazing, coupled with the freedom card, but I still have my Amex open, for length of credit.",

I'm also hypocritical because I kept my chase account. I have had them for way too long and got grandfathered into $0 monthly fees.\n\nI use it as a go through account for a direct deposit that is difficult to change. Just look for good reviews and features you like.\n\nI personally kept a bank that has brick and mortar and an online bank. Brick and mortar comes in handy when you need something quickly and use zelle to transfer between the two.\n\nThere are good and bad things about big banks and about online banks.i try to take the best of both and use it to my advantage",

Banks dont really investigate, so they dont exactly care you were out of town. Like others have said, a shipping address and a name would go a long way to showing its ID theft.",

Conveniently, Target only keeps video for sixty days.\n\nI went as far as giving Chase the GPS data from my phone showing I was nowhere near that store on the day the order was placed or picked up, and they had the nerve to ask me if I had any other proof that I wasn't there that day.\n\nI told them, \"look, I don't want to sound rude, but you do realize that you don't get a receipt from every place you don't go in a day saying you weren't there, right?\"\n\nWe closed our Chase accounts that weekend and pulled all our money out. At the time I was doing six figures of business transactions on my Chase cards, and if they won't have my bank over a $250 fraudulent transaction, why should I wait until there's a four or five figure transaction on my account for them to stick me with?",

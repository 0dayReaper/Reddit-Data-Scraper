    "postText": "I was unfortunately sent to federal time out a few years ago. While in there, my wife filed for divorce. She quit paying all of my bills, so I now have a bunch of collections on my credit report.  Right now my score stands around 550 because of this. It's making it impossible for me to find a place to rent let alone apply for a home loan. I'm at a loss on what to do. Thanks in advance for the help.",

As I\u2019m not sure how much you owe, payment plans are usually available if you don\u2019t have enough cash on hand.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d start with the smallest numbers first. The sooner you can get these things down to ZERO, the sooner you\u2019ll move up from 550.\n\nAfter paying some off, it\u2019s usually easy to get a secured credit card. You put up X amount of cash and that becomes your credit line. It\u2019s a good step to build from, in my opinion. \n\nPrior to establishing an agreement with the debt collectors, ask that they\u2019ll remove the collection from your account upon your debt being paid in full. This will also help boost your score the sooner you can pay them off.\n\nGood luck!",

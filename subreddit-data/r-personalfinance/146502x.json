    "postText": "Hi all! I am moving to New haven from NYC  and will need a car to drive around for work (estimate around 10k miles in the year - some out of state driving as well). After the year I plan to move to Denver where I will also need a car. I have around 9k saved up. \n\nMy current thought is to finance a used car for less than $15k with least amount of down payment / monthly payment and then sell it at the end of the year and then get a new car in Denver? Is this the best way to go about this or is there another option I\u2019m not thinking of?\n\nThank you!",

(Put that extra 5k to the side or a CD) Then sell it when you're done. No debt and more pocket friendly. When you get your more permanent vehicle you'll have extra money to go towards something really nice.",

Carfax and get a free cpu scan when you take it on a test drive.\n\n In a nutshell, search low then high. That way when you go to sell it in a year you're more likely to make a profit than take a loss. \ud83d\udc4d",

That will pay into what you put down.  \n\n If you can do it as cash, do so.  If you finance half and pay the other half over the year,  that'll look good on your credit of course.  If your only options are shitty loans/dealerships, definitely get gap coverage on your insurance.",

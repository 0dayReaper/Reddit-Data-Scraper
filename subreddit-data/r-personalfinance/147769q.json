    "postText": "Reaching out to see if anyone can provide some advice for the current situation I\u2019m in. Currently 25 years old. Since the pandemic I have been living at home with my parents, after getting laid off from my job in Manhattan at the start of lockdown in March 2020. I would be unemployed for the next year or so, spending a lot of my savings during the weirdest, most depressing time in my life\u2026 \n\nSince June 2021, I have been working at my family\u2019s company in the HR department doing recruiting. I make around 55k a year. My parents have made quite a bit of $$ over the years, and have provided me with groceries etc. while living at home etc. I was paying 500 a month for rent while I was living there. \n\nHowever, recently, I have been going absolutely mad living at home with my parents, as one normally does. I am moving out next month and I have spent money way too loosely over the past year or two. Really taking too many vacations, spending way too much money when going out on the weekends, and ordering food in, etc. I barely have much saved up beyond a years worth of rent or so. Which I know should really be saved as a true emergency fund for now.\n\nI went to public school and didn\u2019t pay much attention in college when I should have with financial stuff, and I feel nervous about now having to pay rent, phone, car, grocery bills on 55k when I\u2019ve been covered for so long under my parents. I know how spoiled that sounds. I just am done with feeling like people are helping me out with anything at all.\n\nIf anyone has budgeting suggestions, advice on setting up various accounts that gain on interest, ways to make money online etc. all legal of course, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire.\n\nOpen up and max out a Roth IRA. There is a book. \nyou can borrow from your local library. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle. This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it. Broad market ETFs for the win.\n\nIf you have extra money, gradually max out your 401K to $22500 if you're comfortable with your monthly budget.",

I just am done with feeling like people are helping me out with anything at all.**\n\nIt's not just 'feeling like' it sounds like they made it entirely too easy for you but I give them credit for at least charging you rent.\n\nI totally get the need to get out on your own. I did it at 21 and moved to another state 1300 miles away. To tell you it was easy would be a total lie. \n\nIn your case unless you can find another or even better job I urge you to not burn any bridges. They gave you that job and they can take it away?  \n\n\nIn order to even consider moving out you need to prepare. Have you lived on your own before, do you have furniture, pots and pans, dishes, vacuum etc to furnish a new place.\n\nDo you have any savings to at least put down 3 months worth of rent and at minimum a 3-6mo emergency fund.\n\nDo you have any debts: school loans, credit card, car loan, do yo pay your own cell phone, insurance or were your parents covering that too.\n\nWhen looking for a place don't forget about utilities, laundry gets expensive if not in unit, parking? \n\nGather up all this info and then put the coming in on one side of the page, going out on the other. See what you have left for food, cleaning, hygiene products etc.\n\nIf your parents are well off I'll assume they had a nice home and you were pretty comfortable, you might have to lower your lifestyle expectations out on your own.   \n\n\nWe're not rich by any stretch but it's all relative. My son was friends with a young man who spent his life in the ghetto, he came to our house the first time and it was 'you didn't tell me you were rich'.  My son responded with 'none of this is mine, it belongs to my parents and it took them almost 30 yrs of work to get here' . For perspective we bought a 70s raised ranch that needed almost everything redone, not a mansion by any means.",

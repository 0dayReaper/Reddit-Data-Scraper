They are an investment in your future.\"\n\nBut I have read articles about people struggling to repay their student loans and how they are paying so much in interest. Is my Geography teacher a bad source? Are student loans \"good debt\" or \"bad debt\"?",

That\u2019s a \u201cgood\u201d risk to take *IF* 1) the degree that you earn makes you significantly more likely to land the job you are aiming for and 2) the job you are aiming for outearns the job you\u2019d have without the degree by enough money to cover the additional debt service. \n\nTL;DR: this could be a good risk to take.

            "comment": "Student loans themselves are great. You can almost think of them as a form of time travel, in that your future self can send money \"back in time\" to help your past self pay for expenses now. If there is a career which will dramatically increase your income, but entering that career requires expensive education and training, then student loans can let you use some of that increased future income to pay for the necessary education now, and thus get you into that career faster so you can start earning more money sooner. This can be a better financial decision than delaying that education (and thus delaying the start of your higher-earning income years) while you try to save up and pay for that education with your current lower income potential.\n\nThe problem with student loans is when you overpay for your education relative to the economic benefits that the education provides. The worst-case examples of this are often people who incur large debt loads and then fail to complete their degrees, so they pay a ton of money without even receiving the minimal benefit of being able to list a college degree on their resume. Another problem is paying far more for your degree than that degree is \"worth\", from the perspective that you buy a degree now to increase your future income later.\n\nYou can of course overpay for an education without using debt of any kind, assuming you have the assets up. But the cost of overpaying with savings and investments is a more abstract kind of opportunity cost. If you use student loans to pay for an education which does not produce a material boost in income, then you are stuck with student loans payments that you have to pay even though you never received that extra boost of income.\n\nA rough but common guideline is to limit your education expenses to no more than 1x your post-graduation starting salary. Ideally you'd keep the ratio even lower at 0.75x or smaller. The higher your ratio of student loan debt to income, the more you will find yourself struggling to make your debt payments and still live a comfortable life.",

            "comment": "There are some people who find any and all debt abhorrent. There are people who see it as a tool. I am more of the latter. I took out Stafford Loans to pay for my graduate school. At the time, the maximum amount was about $18,500/yr which is what I had in a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized loans. I paid the interest quarterly while I was in school because my parents' accountant told me to. \n\nWhen I began repaying 6 months after graduation, the interest rate was at 8% (or whatever the highest percentage was allowable for Stafford Loans at the time). Within a about 2 years the interest rate on Staffords went down and I consolidated the loans at maybe 2% or 3%. I believe the consolidation turned it into a 20 year loan.  Then they lopped off half a percent on the interest rate because of my 100% payment history. Then I signed up for auto debit (I finished my Master's in 2000 and this was relatively new at the time and they were trying to incentivize autopay over people mailing in checks every month) and they lopped off another half percent. \n\nI think my payments were maybe $600/month when I first started repaying them at the highest interest rate. Because of the low interest rates on my loans after consolidation, they were never a burden to me financially. I was paying less than $200/mo for years and years before I finally paid them off in 2015 with a lump sum payment of funds that I had saved up while working overseas with hardly any living expenses for 3 years. \n\nI never regretted them for one minute. I never felt ripped off. The loans were a tool to get me what I wanted. I chose to go to one of the more expensive private universities in the US for my graduate degree rather than going to a state school because of their specific program. I could have gotten into my industry with only a Bachelor's degree. However, we work with a lot of government contracts and having a Master's degree allowed me to be billed at a higher bill rate faster and so it opened doors to advancement faster.",

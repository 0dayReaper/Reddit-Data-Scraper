    "postText": "Hi! Having trouble concentrating on documentation for a few PF apps today and realizing I might need to level up to small business finance app anyways after reading these threads. Moving away from MINT, and YNAB is 100% not what I need after trying it last year. Monarch, Copilot, Simplifi, Quicken are what Im digging into, other ideas so welcome!\n\nI\u2019m getting nerdy! here are my half-baked reqs:\n\n1. I want the app to alert me via text message when I\u2019m x dollars away (or -$) from budget cap for each category/micro category or merchant so I don\u2019t go over \n2. I want the app to use plaid + support a csv import feature + manual input so it auto-imports wherever possible and also supports non-connected institutions/transactions \n3. I want the app to show me my full financial picture - ie what my net worth is, so it includes mortgage, investments etc. \n4. I want the ability to have 2+ separate views, one from a personal finance lens, one from a small business lens (some accounts overlap, some don\u2019t, I can cherry pick accounts for each view/dashboard/transaction list/analytics)\n5. I need it to connect to Venmo automatically for tracking those transactions, possibly cash app too (no Mint)\n6. I want budget tracking and trend analysis tools showing spending habits over time (Mint went downhill here somehow)\n\nTY \ud83d\udc9b",

The issue with this, is it takes time for auto import, or requires manual churching to really see accurate data. By the time you get the message, you could have hundreds of pending charges for the category. That means angry customers.\n\n2. Pretty easy to find.\n\n3. Do you want it auto importing things like house values and investment account info?\n\n4. I'm able to do this on YNAB by picking which categories to show in reports.\n\n5. How can an app properly categorize these transfers? Or do you just want import, then you'll manually assign? That highlights why 1 isn't a something am app designer would focus on. \n\n6. YNAB does this well.",

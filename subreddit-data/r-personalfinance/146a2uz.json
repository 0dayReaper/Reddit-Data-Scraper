    "postText": "Its one of those things you'd \\*like\\* to set and forget, but absolutely should not...\n\nI've had homeowners insurance through Liberty Mutual for the last 3 years. I shopped around in 2020 and found them to be the cheapest option at $1376/yr. Since then they've raised rates at an astonishing rate:\n\n\\* 2021: $1594/yr (15.8% increase)\n\n\\* 2022: $2020/yr (26.7% increase)\n\n\\* 2023: $2542/yr (25.8% increase). I had autopay on and was sticker-shocked when I saw this amount paid just days after it autorenewed! I opted into a renewal reminder so as not to get ripped off next year\n\n\\* 2024: My policy ends end of June. I shopped around for an hour and already found similar insurance quotes for $1400 (55% decrease), and am waiting on some local insurance companies who will likely give me even lower rates.\n\nTLDR: shop around for homeowners insurance \\*nearly every year\\*. Its tedious, but will save you thousands.",

The cost of construction has also exploded since the current inflation started.  It's no wonder the insurance in going up with it. \n\nThat said, it never hurts to shop around every few years for better rates.  It's easy to get comfortable with your insurance company and just pay what they want.  But be careful that you get the same coverage for the lower rate. And they could start raising you after a year or two of the teaser rate.",

They were substantially cheaper than everywhere else, for just homeowners. Vehicle was slightly higher but then the mutli-policy discount of homeowners+vehicle ate the vehicle increase up and I saved a bit more on top of that. The umbrella was about the same from other places; I just switched it so it's all in one place.",

But I've had two big claims in the past - a complete roof tear-off replacement about 10 years ago, and a total collapse of our enclosed patio from ice damage in 2021. Both times they were so easy to deal with compared to some horror stories I've heard, and we paid nothing out of pocket for either claim - they covered the whole expense with a little left over even. \n\nI could probably get cheaper elsewhere, especially at an introductory rate, but I'm afraid of what might happen if we had another big claim and had to deal with a red tape nightmare on top of whatever damage was done to our house.",

Florida, Texas, and California homeowners may have an especially hard time finding new policies/companies to work with because of the number of natural disasters occuring within those states. Just saying this so folks don't call into a company with an attitude and then find themselves unable to be insured.",

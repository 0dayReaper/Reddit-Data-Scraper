    "postText": "For context I am a noob at personalfinance, and I'm looking into a new car and debating if I should pay in full or finance and invest the money instead. A friend advised me to put some money in Wealthfront and said it will grow over time. However, over the past year or so I've lost money, and a while ago I stopped adding money to the account. \n\nIs now a good time to invest money in Wealthfront (or any service similar to that), or should I just keep it in the bank?",

( you have read the wiki at least once, right?)\n\nIs buying a newer car needed?   Or is this a want?   If you are going to buy a car but you are comparing the car to investing in stocks, seems this is a discretionary want, not a need.  So, do you prefer to pay interest or pay outright to avoid the extra burden of debt slavery?\n\nCan you elaborate on your goals here?",

Do NOT discount the super power of investing as young as you can, but if where you are moving requires independent transportation that isn't supplied by public transit or a moped, then you need a car.   A newer car unless you have the knowledge and facility to fix up a 'mechanic's special'.  However, buying newer vs buying new means you need to read similar wikis on how to buy a car and why buying either can be better than the other.\n\nI don't know if you have this book in your library, but it might be helpful:  Dont get taken every time - guide to buying or leasing a car by Sutton, Remar\n\nAfter you buy your newer (but not new unless you absolutely must) car, you'll come back here and reread the wiki about investing for the future.   Here's some additional reading material:\n\nFinancial blogs, books and podcasts:\n\nLibrary Books: Simple Path to Wealth (Collins) - Your Money or Your Life (Robin); Broke Millennial (Lowry); CleverGirl Finance (Sokunbi); How to Invest in Real Estate (Turner, Dorkin); Small Business Bible (Strauss);  Get it together - organize your records so your family won't have to (Cullin, part of the NOLO series).  Two free books: https://paulmerriman.com/millions-downloads/  \n\nBlogs/sites:  biggerpockets.com - mrmoneymustache.com - bogleheads.org - iwillteachyoutoberich.com - gocurrycracker.com - frugalwoods.com  How do I get started investing?  https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started \n \nPodcasts: Big Picture Retirement - Mad Fientist - Bigger Pockets - Optimal Daily Finance - Stacking Benjamins - Radical Personal Finance - Journey to Launch - The Money with Katie show - lots more.   Start from the earliest available episodes and work chronologically to today, as many of these build on prior episodes in knowledge and evolve over time. \n\nA typical flowchart to explore: https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png \nor https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ecn2hk/fire_flow_chart_version_42/ or https://u.cubeupload.com/demonlesondledon/FIREFlowChart.png",

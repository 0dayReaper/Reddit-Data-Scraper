    "postText": "[Pennsylvania]\n\nI got some medical testing done at Quest Diagnostics in 2021 and 2022. I have primary health insurance, as well as gap insurance that covers my entire deductible. Quest Diagnostics only billed my primary insurance. I contacted them **repeatedly** asking them to bill my gap insurance, and they never did. I contacted my gap insurance and they confirmed that they never received bills from Quest.\n\nNow the bills have gone into collections. The collections agency is telling me that it's my responsibility to pay the debt, and then seek reimbursement for the debt from my gap insurance company. I have spent SO. MANY. HOURS. on the phone with all of these companies. I'm really not interested in paying these bills and then hoping that the gap insurance will decide to pay me back.\n\nWhat will happen if I don't pay these bills? It's only $687, so I don't think the collections agency would be particularly motivated to come after me, right? Will this affect my credit? Will they just send me letters for the rest of my life? Can I ask them to stop contacting me?\n\nAny informed thoughts appreciated! And please let me know if I should be posting this somewhere else, apologies if this is the wrong place.",

            "comment": "I have two medical debts on my credit report for a few years now. One 1500 and another 500. \n\nThey were both emergency room visits when I did not have coverage so it was kind of unavoidable. \n\nDuring the pandemic, it did affect my ability to rent as that was the main reason stated on the applications, but they obviously compared me to other potential tenants and screened me out. That is/was the big negative drawback. \n\nBeyond that, i still have various elements that makes my credit still good and the blemish is what it is in my book. I recently got pre-approved through my credit union for a 45k, 5.5% loan for max of 72 mos and even though I\u2019m not going to take it, my view is that if my union finds me credit worthy while i have a car note already with similar loan offer then its in decent shape. \n\nI only have one credit card and i strictly use it to purposefully show that i have credit and i use it within reason. \n\nAlso ive had a few other debts i didnt pay when i was much younger and they do in fact take it off of your record, ive settled and paid in full, it just takes like 3-5 months for everything to cycle out. \n\nSo make sure you do it in writing and theyll happily take half or so to clear you out. The original debt has been sold so as far as the debt you accumulated originally, that place is satisfied with selling your debt so theyre beyond the point of caring about you they solved their problem, now the debt collector os trying to make a profit, they probably bought that debt wholesale and its their job to go through it and make a return on that buy. So if you settle for less, it will eventually clear\u2026 since its already on your record. \n\nThere are other ways to approach this of you dont want to pay that someone might be able to chime in on. For me i messed up a lot over the years so i just wanted to let you know what happens in real time from my experience.",

If you didn\u2019t know how, you could have called the gap insurance company and asked.\n\nThat said, negotiate with the debt collector. They paid pennies on the dollar for that debt. Pretty much anything they receive from you is profit. If you end up paying $188 dollars, then the medical bill is under $500 and can\u2019t be reported to credit agencies.",

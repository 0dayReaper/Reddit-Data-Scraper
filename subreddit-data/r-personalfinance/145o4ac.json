    "postText": "I'm very new to savings so apologies in advance if this come off naive. I just opened up a Roth IRA account through Schwab and put in $6500. I'll be starting a new job in July and want to contribute to my 401k. What do I need to know about the max I can put in to it? Is there a way my Roth IRA yields some kind of interest or something like that without having to put in the max every year?",

See if you can get to 15%.\n\nYour Roth IRA should be invested in something. Probably a Target Date Retirement Fund. The balance will sometimes go up when the market goes up. Sometimes it'll go down, or stay flat for a while, but over the long term (decades), your balance will increase even if you never make another contribution to the Roth IRA again (but, you should try to make some more contributions as you can afford to, because saving for retirement is important).\n\nMake sure that Roth IRA money is invested inside the account.",

            "comment": "Your Roth IRA through Schwab is unrelated to your 401(k) through your employer. Separate limits, so nothing to worry about there.\n\nThe IRA limit of $6,500 is for contributions not overall value. Whether your IRA funds are sitting as cash gaining interest (albeit low and inadvisable) or are otherwise invested and gaining other forms of investment growth, none of that impacts your contribution limit. Depending on your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, etc, you'll want to consider how best to allocate these funds to properly plan for retirement needs.\n\nAs for the 401(k), that has a much higher annual limit (see [here](https://www.investopedia.com/retirement/401k-contribution-limits/)). It is the same concept as the IRA though. You'll want to determine the best allocation of funds and let it sit until retirement, adding monthly contributions. At minimum, you'll want to at least contribute enough to max out your employer's matching contributions, if that's something they offer. I would prioritize the employer-matched 401(k) over any IRA contributions as it is effectively \"free money.\"",

I was able to get in touch with someone at a local branch and they helped me with some of the basics, but you can also pay $300 to speak with a CFP, if you so desire. I've been trying to avoid that by just researching (lots of great YouTube videos on basic retirement planning &amp; investment concepts).\n\nBest of luck on the journey!",

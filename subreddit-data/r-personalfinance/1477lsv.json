    "postText": "So I just recently refinanced my auto loan through capital one. Today was the due date for my first payment and when I went to pay it it said I owe the normal $367 monthly payment, but also an additional $367 labeled \u201cpast due\u201d. I\u2019m confused because today is my first payment and the due date. Do they make you make you pay 2 payments the first time or am I missing something?",

Pretty sure the timing got messed up because I submitted a payment for the first period before setting up autopay.\n\nIt's entirely possible that your first payment was due immediately upon loan origination just like how paying rent or internet works.",

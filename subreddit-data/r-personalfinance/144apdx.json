    "postText": "On 12/1/2022, I was issued a $10,000 Series I Savings Bond.  The Interest Rate when I locked in was showing at 3.79%.  My current value is now showing as $10,172.\n\nMy understanding is every 6 months, the interest would be added, so I would have thought that I would have $10,379 now.  But Im new to all this so maybe I misunderstood how this works.  Can someone explain?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT - not touching the bond, leaving it be for years.\n\nEDIT2 - Thank you for explaining how this is the 3 month penalty on display, showing for the next 5 years.",

That\u2019s because if you cash a bond before 5 years, we don\u2019t pay you the final 3 months of interest.*\n\n* https://www.treasurydirect.gov/savings-bonds/i-bonds/i-bonds-interest-rates/",

The 9.62% or whatever it was two years ago, was 4.81% for six months, then adjusted lower for the next six months.  The rate has gone down since that 9.62% rate, but the guaranteed fixed rate has gone up.\n\nright now, the ibond rate is 4.3% which includes the fixed rate of 0.9%..  The fixed rate stays 0.90% but the 4.3%-0.9=3.4% is actually 1.7%, then divide the 0.9% by 2 = 0.45% so the actual six month rate until October 31, 2023 is 1.7% plus 0.45% = 2.15%.\n\nI might be wrong in my understanding, but i won't be buying anymore ibonds, I feel like the fed is lying to me about inflation.",

The rate for bonds bought from November 2022 to April 2023 was 6.89%.  \n\nThe rate changes in May and November but you get 6 months of whatever rate was in effect at the time of purchase.  When your 6 months is up, you get the rate current rate.\n\nI have 3 bonds bought in 2021,2022 and 2023, all 3 are earning different rates.  \n\nThe 6 months you mentioned is how often the interest is compounded, added to your principal and begins to earn its own interest.  The way the Treasury holds back 3 months of interest makes it difficult to reconcile your rate with the interest posted, so not surprising that many people misunderstand how the investment is growing.",

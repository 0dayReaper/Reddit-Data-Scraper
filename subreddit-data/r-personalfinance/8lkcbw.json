    "postText": "So, twelve days ago, my great-grandma had a stroke. My grandmother, my legal caregiver, went to the local hospital (a ripe two hour drive away) and has stayed there ever since to ensure that the doctors don't take her mom off life support. My aunt, my other caregiver, and her kids went with her.\n\nSo long story short, I'm home alone. I've been home alone for over ten days and have had to take care of the family's two sheep, two goats, five dogs, three cats, six large birds, dozens of chickens/ducks/quails/guineas, two horses, and a rabbit to boot\n\nThe people taking care of me don't know when they'll be home. They're not gonna let the doctors let my grandma die so they're gonna stay there until she dies naturally or recovers, which could be months. I've expressed my concerns through text and have only been met with \"I don't knows\" and the like. They've come home twice (for a couple hours) just to check on things but aren't making money themselves so they haven't been able to help.\n\nI'm basically taking care of a house and all these animals alone at 17.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. Eventually bills will start popping up and the animal are already low on food.\n\nI have a weekly shift at McDonalds to fund myself, but in the area I live, the bus to town runs very rarely so taking full time hours isn't an easy solution. \n\nI go to school as well since a school bus goes through my area. (though I'd be willing to drop out if needed)\n\nTL;DR: Fending for myself, as well as dozens of farm animals, for an indeterminate I make almost no money and live in a rural area.\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you for your replies, I'll read them all and respond when I'm out of school in a couple hours!\n\n**UPDATE:** Thank you all for replying, I'll try to get through as many as I can but I honestly did not expect this to blow up like it did. Anyway, I talked to my family and while they're not returning home, my aunt has come back with cat and dog food so the animals won't starve for now. She says she doesn't know how much longer they will be gone but don't anticipate it being months like they originally thought. I'm going off her words here. I also talked to my manager and am getting three evening shifts this week over my usual weekly one, so I'm not gonna be completely broke. The bus rarely comes through but I'm fine killing time in town if it means more money coming in. I won't drop out of school either. I was just panicked and assumed I'd have to work full time. I'll update more as events unfold",

What quality of life is laying in a hospital bed hooked up to tubes and wires? If the family is there saying their last goodbyes then that's awesome. Everyone needs closure.\n\nMy sister was on life support for about a week after she overdosed. Seeing her there in that bed with a DNR bracelet on absolutely killed me. It's hard processing someone that you love isn't there anymore. \n\nIt's actually about a year ago to the day that this happened. I'm glad we were all able to get closure and hold her hand and cry, but if it had gone on much longer, I think it would've made the grieving process much harder. \n\nSorry for the rant.

The day before Thanksgiving, she DROVE herself to the emergency room ,signed a D.N.R. (Do Not Resuscitate order) and was admitted. After all she shit she lived through, It was Salmonella (of all things!) that took her. She was made comfortable and went quickly and quietly. Just the way she wanted to go. Of course it was hard for us, but It would have sucked for her if we had tried to keep her alive for longer. I don't understand that kind of selfishness. ",

If they want to come home to their animals, they have to have been taken care of while they were gone. I\u2019m sure  they didn\u2019t starve them while they were there. \n\nA lot of responsibilities have been thrown on you at once. Above all, take care of yourself. Get to school, get to work. You do what you can with feeding the animals and taking care of them in your free time. I\u2019d forward the bills to your family. Realistically they know that you can\u2019t pay them and just because hard times hit, doesn\u2019t mean they can drop all of their responsibilities.\nBuy non perishable food so you have some if you get in a crunch. If they\u2019re neglecting your needs, I\u2019d call them every day. It\u2019s not like your asking for a million dollars, your trying to keep their pets alive. \n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to vent. You\u2019re under a lot of stress. You can always talk to me if need be. ",

You don't live in a survival situation in Alaska.\n\nYou work at McDonalds and you go to school. So you talk to your school counselor and your manager. Talk to your friends and in particular talk to your friends' parents. Talk to your teachers. Tell them you're a minor and left home alone for months without money. Tell them animals are being neglected on the farm. Tell them you need help and would like to talk to a social worker. Let them know you need direct help and if they can't, help with getting in contact with professionals.\n\nBefore you do all this, give your caregivers a warning call explaining you'll be telling everyone about this. Tell them they can either send an adult home who pays the bills and feeds you and lives with you indefinitely, or you're going to do everything you can to talk to a social worker.  \n\nThat having been said, please be careful about just trusting anyone. Go through people you trust, e.g. adults in your school or those who work at the municipality. Not strangers. And let others know who you're talking to, keep as many people as you can in the loop.

My parents have housed half a dozen or so various friends of mine and my siblings throughout the years, kids with issues at home or just kids with no home left to go to. For several of them, finding support  or safety when their family was unable to offer it was the key to helping them transition functionally into adulthood.\n\nIt also opened my mind to the value of generosity, and the ways that investments in people can be successful or harmful. I'm not close to having my own home yet, but I hope that when I do I can carry forward that spirit of trying to catch a few people before they fall through the cracks.",

If you haven't called the government for aid yet, that's also on your list of things to do.  Every province has their own hotline and a 17 year old will qualify for cash assistance fairly easily. \n\nHope that helps /u/appleboiii",

Taking care of those animals, while at the same time feeding themselves, had to require employment by someone, even if they are on government assistance to supplement.\n\n  \n\n\nSomething is missing from OP's story (just to clarify I am NOT saying this kid is being dishonest, just that there has to be some important details he left out).

They may not be close in distance, but they can be closer than your own family if you let them.  On the farm where I grew up, my brother and father often went out to help the neighbors and didn't expect a thing in return.  They also got plenty of help when they had accidents and needed a hand.\n\nFirst thing I suggest is use the power of the community grapevine.  You work at McD's right?  Do you have a group of regulars who show up every day for coffee time?  This group is the people who will know know who to talk to.  The ones you want are the ones who have the farmer's tan. Often they are semi-retired or retired locals who gather to get the latest gossip and talk shop.  All you have to do is explain your situation and ask for advice.\n\nSecond thing you should do is try the local priest or pastor's office.  The administration staff are often the most well connected people in the community, and can refer you to others who can lend a hand.\n\nYour local constable is also a good person to contact.  They often know what groups can give you a hand.\n\nThat's what I've got for now.  I can pretty much guarantee that you will get more help (and casseroles) than you expect.",

The vast majority of animals are consolidated and transported live to a handful of processing plants.  These plants are likely located several hundred kilometres from OP. When you do get them there, you have to have all your paperwork in order, including all documents about where the animal was born and what medical treatment it has had.  If you don't have that, the plant can't even let you bring the animal close to the other animals, in order to avoid the spread of disease. OP would have to have all of this straightened out.",

It sounds like OP would have to walk the animal to the butcher, and most butchers require a processing fee upfront, plus OP would have to bring the meat back with them. It may be different in Canada, but in the US, butchers won't usually buy an assortment of animals from farmers down on their luck. The butcher's won't be able to sell the meat of questionable origin. Not to mention that most animals should sit for a day before butchering, not being fed, which won't work out well if OP has to walk the animals to the butcher.",

It's a surprisingly common fear that families with loved ones in the ICU express but the decision to not escalate care and the decision to withdraw care are taken very seriously and the maximum effort is made to involve the family every step of the way. The only circumstance I can think of where we can pull life support without familial consent is probably brain death and even that varies by jurisdiction and culture. Legal brain death is exactly that, a complete loss of brain stem reflexes usually reflecting catastrophic brain injury. Every so often the media showcases a miracle case where someone has recovered from such a situation but I can assure you that if they recovered - they were not brain dead in the first place and you can usually tell if you read a bit into these stories.\n\nWhile I can certainly go further into detail about such end of life decisions - the purpose of putting this all out there is that the fear that your loved one will be killed by unthinking unfeeling doctors is an unfounded one. Your family members do not need to stand guard at your great grandmother's bedside 24/7. Your aunt with her kids (who will probably not be allowed into an ICU anyway) certainly does not need to be there.\n\nYour post carries this 'this is my life now' air of despair and resignation which is quite surprising. I'm certain you're not being abandoned to take care of farm animals in perpetuity and a phone call expressing your concerns is certain to bring the adults back home. Goodluck! ",

Start rationing the animal food in anticipation of it taking time.  Reduced food over a longer period of time is better than totally running out and feeding them nothing for numerous days. \n\nAlso, by their responses, it sounds like you are asking the wrong questions and/or not communicating the relevant information. Rather than, \"when are you coming home?\", say \"We are running out of animal feed. You need to make arrangements to supply more. \" ",

This is technically child abuse/neglect.  \nIf they refuse to help you with the money for THEIR shit, play hard ball: tell them they must provide, or you will be talking to Child Protective Services.",

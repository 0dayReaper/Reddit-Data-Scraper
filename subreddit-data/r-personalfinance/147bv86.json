    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI have an upcoming family vacation on a credit card with 20 months interest-free. The amount is $790 and I have the means to pay it off but I keep telling myself since it is 0% I might as well drag it out and collect 5% via interest through money market.  The other part is that I would feel much better being debt free if I pay it and be done with it.\n\nThoughts on either approach?  \n\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone, I am going to pay it off. ",

I have a balance on a couple 0% credit cards and I could pay them off almost entirely right now.\n\nThe allure of being completely debt free (for the first time in nearly 25 years) is strong, but I've been holding on to my money in a HYSA anyway.\n\nI usually act based on my head, not my heart, and this is where I've ended up: Keep the money for now.",

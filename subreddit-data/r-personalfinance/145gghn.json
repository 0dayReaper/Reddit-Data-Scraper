I've had next to no issues.\n\nOnly issue I can remember, and it's tiny, but my debit card was hijacked and the rep canceled it, issued a refund, and sent a new card. A week later (and I'm borrowing cash because I never got a local backup account when we moved) I call in and was informed a new card was never issued nor was the refund.\n\nSo I get my new card overnighted (or two day maybe), I see the refund she issued but also a refund the first guy issued.\n\nNever had any long hold times on few times I wanted to call (mostly regarding wire transfers) and it seems to be US based support.\n\nI love their 18 month CD rates.",

Until they do, don't reward companies with your loyalty. When you're worth more on the open market than your company will give you, they are doing you a disservice and you should make the best decision for your own future and go make what you're worth. The more people who do this, the more likely companies will be to change and allow us to stick around and be compensated for it.\n\nMillenials often started their careers in the recession, and have an inset fear of the job market because of it. They often walk around moping as if the economy is stuck in 2009, and it's not. The market is good right now, go test it.",

In my experience, asking potential employers \"challenging\" questions does not always pay off, because many employers don't like employees who \"rock the boat\" too much.\n\n--\n\nEDIT: South African here. I've used the \"ask the interviewing employer\" challenging questions approach to great success in both South Africa and in London, but in my experience, it does not go down well in Sydney, Australia. In fact, I worked for a large organisation in Sydney - and luckily for me I did not use the \"ask a challenging question\" approach when I was interviewed -  because I was later promoted to management and it was then that I discovered that the organisation uses a hiring approach that cuts out \"outliers\". If your cv is strong enough, you will be invited to interview with them. If you interview well enough, you will be invited to participate in a staff \"obstacle course\" day, during which you are put into teams and have to solve problems and overcome challenges. During this last stage, there are a number of staff members who watch all of the participants. Outliers who do poorly - contribute little, and are always last to overcome challenges - don't get hired. Outliers who do too well - contribute far more than the rest, and are always racing to finish first - same story, they get cut, because management does not want to hire people who will try to \"shake up the system\". In most cases, they just want you to become a quiet cog in the machine.\n\n--\n\nEDIT 2: I should point out that, when I first arrived in Sydney I worked in Investment Banking (after 4 years of doing the same in London), and I was retrenched from one of my first jobs with the employer telling my recruitment agency something to the effect of ~ \"He's too bright, can you please send us a less qualified person\" ~ it wasn't that I was trying to be \"challenging\" but, this employer did a lot of things that I honestly believed were nonsensical, and when I asked them why we did things this way, none of the existing staff members knew why.\n\n--\n\nOn another job, I found a way to do things significantly more efficiently - and more logically - than the way they were currently being done. This new approach would have both - saved the company huge amounts of man hours, and it would also have improved the quality of the work. I suggested this new approach to my boss quite humbly, but she unexpectedly became irate and said that if I wanted to take \"shortcuts\" then I should find another job. Then she stormed out of the office. (To be fair, she wasn't really qualified to work in this field.) This was on a Friday. On the Monday morning, before work, my agency called me to say that I was no longer needed at the company...\n\n--\n\nEDIT 3: The above is often referred to as \"Tall Poppy Syndrome\" and it is very prevalent in Australian culture.\n\n--\n\nhttps://thingsaussieslike.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/no-18-tall-poppy-syndrome/\n\nIt's a classic case of a senior manager protecting the power that he/she is able to wield - by eliminating any staff members who shine too brightly and who might become a threat to their ability to wield power unchecked.\n",

They've got a dozen candidates lined up to interview in fifteen minute segments after you walk out the door. They don't give a crap.\n\nI'm fortunate enough to find myself in an industry at a particular point in time in history where I'm in high enough demand that I can make certain expectations of my potential employer.

He's not allowed to give them himself without getting a sign off from his boss who isn't going to do it.\n\nGot hired on 6 years ago at an entry level and am currently at the top of my field (which required the company to invest at least 10k into training).  Salary didn't keep pace.  Finally got fed up and shopped myself around.  Got an offer with an 18% pay increase.  Told my boss about it and was given all the reasons why leaving would be bad for my career, but no offer.  Came in the next day and turned in my notice.  That afternoon I got a 13% pay increase offer to stay.  Ended up taking it for various reasons.\n\nSeems ridiculous for a company to invest so much time and effort into an employee only to let them get poached and all of it go to benefit another company.",

Too little; too late.\n\nYou may get what you want, but you may also get yourself noted down as a 'flight risk' and thus not offered training/interesting projects in case you leave.\n\nAnd you may put yourself above the 'standard' salary bracket, meaning no pay rises when others get them, and first on the chopping block when cuts are to be made.\n\nI won't say _never_ take a counter offer, but ... if they don't want to abuse you whilst you're still in post, and dial it back when they go too far, that _isn't_ a healthy relationship.

I think I made the decision to leave once I start interviewing.  I have referred friends/peers to my company and they ended up just using my company's offer as leverage.  That affects my employer relationship, so I became very selective.\n\nWhen my company cold called me, my research found that they have a reputation for not paying competitively and taking forever to hire.  It looked like an awesome job.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  I replied back VERY professionally saying how much I wanted to make and how quickly I needed the process to go.\n\nThe reply back was 'we'll pay you that if you can qualify for the relatively high position that pays that rate' - I prepared greatly and have been there four years now.",

I quit a few hours later without another job lined up.  That made some noise.  My next employer of 2.5 years called me before I got home.  I stalled them to unwind and in early December was working on a Waikiki hotel balcony for $5k more per year.\n\nI never would have dropped the mic like that if I was sitting on less than a few months of savings.

My company just handed off a lucrative line of business from a veteran employee to me, in addition to my existing responsibilities. It will take me a year or more to reach her level of proficiency and rebuild those relationships. And they're banking on the fact that I'll stay with the company for the next few years. Seems very unwise to do that just to save $20k a year to match her new salary.",

Depending on what kinds of projects you do, it can often take years to see proof projects were executed correctly. Hopping around every few years completely removes you from even seeing how the effort turned out. In a number of industries, 4-5 year experience at a well known company is prime poaching target for competitors. \n\nNow the reason you may not be offered retainer offer is because new employer only sees you as promising potential, while your current employer already knows you well and considers you a reliable scrub.

I live in a city with a big startup &amp; IT market and there are a couple bootcamps to quickly churn out programmers, so I wondered if the music was going to stop as more and more programmers joined up.\n\nI've realized a few things, though. First is that it takes a lot of experience to make a good programmer. Years worth. The people coming out of these camps are the most junior of junior while companies are dying for senior programmers who can be productive with minimal hand-holding; programmers are too expensive for companies to have the capacity to have their seniors training up juniors unless they really have to.\n\nSecond is that code knowledge is only part of the game. There's also communication skills, decision making ability, and things that are harder to teach.\n\nAnd lastly is that there's a really limited people with the true aptitude for coding. Training can only get someone so far. If a person doesn't have a natural aptitude, they're only ever going to be *okay.*",

There are reasons to stay (like moving into a position closer to what you want to do, to gain some experience in it, etc.), but eventually, it's just better to get out. \n\nNetwork like crazy, never tell the whole truth if you don't have to, don't try to make friends with coworkers like it's high school, and look out for yourself above all else.

Switching jobs can be expensive if you have to relocate or spend a lot of time hunting for those new opportunities. And hiring and training a new employee is always more expensive than keeping one a company already has.",

My family used to give me so much grief for all of my job hopping.  That's just how tech works.  The most vocal was a sister-in-law that hopped almost as often as I did - and she was an accountant.\n\nI do the job for which I'm hired and then grow myself past that requirement into areas that interest me while ensuring the extra work has mutual value.  It takes me about 2~2.5 years to run out of room.  [My time at a place is shorter if I have a manager that fucks with my work beyond expectations.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4byx67/we_cant_support_your_growth_because_youll_want/) (my r/talesfromtechsupport post.)   I stay longer if I have a manager that sees value in it.\n\nMy previous record was 3.5 years due to that recession in the early '90s.  My current record is 4.25 years and I see no end in sight for me here.  I'm far from settling down.  This place has so much opporunity to learn and grow.  Being able to transfer between teams and roles helps greatly.",

Without hesitation, he said no, that there's nothing he could do about it. \n\nI started looking for a job somewhere else, without the intention of actually leaving the place, as I really like what I do, and I'm one of the most senior employees here. I got an offer for around 20% more of what I was getting paid. I promptly took my offer letter to my manager, and told him that if he was willing to make me a retention offer. He called HR right there in front of me, and in a matter of 2 days, I got a 30% raise counteroffer, enough to put me a good 15% above of what the new hires are getting offered (which I still think it's shitty). \n\nYMMV, some employers will probably just tell you to go pound sand. \n\n\nTL;DR I got an offer from a different place, took the offer letter to my current employer after they had denied me a raise. The offer letter worked as leverage and got a counter for much more than what I was expecting. ",

We're doing what we have to - to be successful from an economy that was fucked up by baby boomers.

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nLast month, I rolled over my Simple IRA, which was a plan I had with a previous employer, to my 401k.  The Simple IRA had prevented me from performing a backdoor Roth the last 2 years, due to my desire to avoid taxes from Pro-Rata rules.  I contributed to a traditional IRA the past 2 years instead, without taking a deduction.\n\nNow that the rollover is complete,  I have a few questions:\n\n1) Am I now eligible to contribute to my traditional IRA account for this year, then convert the entire traditional IRA to my Roth, or would I need to wait until a later period due to the simple IRA belonging to me some portion of 2023? \n\n2) Is it a problem if I am contributing to a traditional IRA that had previously only contained funds I had not taken a deduction for before?\n\nThanks!",

So if you didn't file Form 8606 for each year in the past, then you should go ahead and do that.",

    "postText": "Edit: I will fix up my current car and drive it until the wheels fall off, thank you all for the input on my desire to buy a new(er) car. It was more an idea of luxury than necessity. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI don\u2019t even know where to begin with this kind of money. Obviously it\u2019s not a TON, but I\u2019m a college student and was pretty poor growing up, so it\u2019s more than I know what to do with. \n\nI\u2019m a 21yo only child, so I was the sole beneficiary when my single, unmarried parent died recently. My inheritance is about 210k. \n\nI\u2019m in college right now. I don\u2019t have student loans, and I have about $5k in my own college fund account and $10k in the college fund my surviving parent has set up for me. My college thus far has been paid for by pell grants and by scholarships. I only have two years left, and I didn\u2019t anticipate needing student loans (before the inheritance). \n\nI have a 15 year old car, so no car note, but I\u2019m planning on buying a new-used car with some of the money. I should be able to get 5-8k for my current car. The car I\u2019d like to buy is about 30k (2022). \n\nI make about $2k a month right now. I have about $5k in savings (not my college savings). \n\nI have no idea where to put this money or whether I should make payments on a car or buy it outright or if/how I should invest (that sounds fucking scary) or really how far this money can stretch. I feel like a deer in headlights right now.",

Do your best to forget you have it.\n\nUse it to pay for your schooling, as those grants are probably going away now.\n\nThe experiences you have now, living as a \u201cstruggling\u201d college student (living with roommates/shared housing, etc) are far more valuable right now than doing something like getting your own apartment. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to be lonely out in the suburbs later in life.\n\nFor investing, take a look at the Boglehead approach (and subreddit). It will help you remain calm and avoid doing silly things like trying to bet on the stock market.",

Overall, I echo the \u201cgo slow\u201d you\u2019ve been fine without it so far so no urgency needed and there are a lot of \u201cone door decisions\u201d for spending/investing money. The one specific thing I\u2019ll add is that in next 3-12 months, while you\u2019re figuring it all out, I suggest opening a \u201chigh yield savings account\u201d and putting vast majority there. I personally use Ally and it is popular here (although there are lots of other good ones). \n\nHere\u2019s why this is a good idea:\n1. It\u2019s a savings account and you can access it very quickly when you do make up your mind after doing research. (limited only to 6 transactions per month which you shouldn\u2019t need and sometimes a couple days to transfer to your checking account).\n2. It has nearly zero risk of losing money (it will be insured by government up to 250k)\n3. It will have around 4% interest (that\u2019s what ally is now). Assuming you keep it there for 12 months that is about 8k (minus taxes) that you get \u201cfor free\u201d.\n\nLong term you should also consider some more risky investments that have higher risk and higher reward and associated complexity for accessing money quickly. For that, I recommend indexing with vanguard but you should really do your research and identify your own personal financial goals first. (Eg do you want to prioritize saving for house vs stock investments etc). The hysa is a good option for now to buy you time, with low risk of major regrets, while still getting immediate interest benefits from a non trivial chunk of money.\n\n\n\n\nAlly\u2019s is currently giving 4% interest",

Not sure if there are conditions or any strings attached to your grants and scholarships based on your new situation.  Make sure your tuition stuff is absolutely locked down before putting any money in investments!  Otherwise keep it in a savings account at your favorite FDIC-insured bank.\n\nSeeing your edit:\n\nHaving no debt and a career path is fantastic.  Here's what I'd recommend:\n\nSooner rather than later, throw 150k into a retirement fund.  A financial advisor at your credit union will help you handle this.\n\nFrom compound interest on this upfront load of cash, you'll be retiring early.\n\nThe 25k from the car, drop into an emergency savings account.  This is to pay for essentials such as rent/bulls from a sudden job loss, medical expense, or whatever.\n\nTake like $10k for yourself in cash and just don't tell any friends.  Maybe spend a small fraction on a luxury item or something.  When you're done with college, you'll likely want an apartment.  The bulk of this should handle your deposit and any furniture you want or need along with moving expenses.\n\nIf your surviving parent isn't cool with you moving back after college while you potentially job hunt, make that emergency fund a bit biggger.  Otherwise if you're on good terms, I'd personally commit to a mutual fund if the rates are appropriate.  Let that balloon over the years and you'll be making a LOT of cash over the years.\n\nOtherwise, just live as normal.  It's boring, but don't be silly and go into any major expenditures like a crazy vacation or home or new car unless you need to or the time is right, and that shouldn't be until you're definitely rock solid in where you're working after some years.\n\nAnd definitely stay away from drugs.  Dead serious.  Cousin of mine was in a similar situation as you.   Tried heroin at a party, and spent everything and is now homeless after also stealing tons more money from her elderly grandparents.  There is nothing worse for your future wealth than having money and getting addicted to something, because it's easy to justify spending when you have a lot, but it's real easy to run out really quick.\n\nIf you're making decent money after you start your job out of college and doing fine financially on your income with a stable next few years and are building up even further adequate savings and retirement contributions, then consider buying yourself the treat of a nice new car having effectively gotten there on your own otherwise, since you'll have been fortunate enough to know you have a solid safety net.  The people here suggesting to drive beaters forever and min-max every facet of your cash are used to giving advice to people in bad spots, not good ones, and with $150k+ in a retirement fund in year zero of working, you can afford a little luxury if it's within your  budget and if it's otherwise coming from earned income.",

You need to finish that first. \n\nNext: Since you\u2019re working, put $6,500 into a Roth IRA to max it out for the year. I\u2019d recommend Fidelity, due to no minimum investments on mutual funds. Do research on some low cost mutual funds, such as FXAIX (large cap), FSMDX (mid cap), FSSNX (small cap), and FSPSX (international). Fidelity has an awesome fund screener where you can compare funds' expense ratios, historical returns, etc. \n\nGet a decent car that will run well - doesn\u2019t need to be a 5k beater, but watch the prices in the market - lately it can be cheaper to buy new than used, depending on the car's make and where you live. Again, do your research. \n\nI\u2019d put most of the money into a true HYSA (high yield savings account), earning at least a 4%+ return on your money, and which is FDIC insured up to $250k.  You can Google for these, or check out the NerdWallet website, which should have recent articles about them. This would help keep the value of your money while you're deciding what to do with the bulk of it - I\u2019d probably leave the majority in savings and use a bit each year to max out that Roth. \n\nGood luck, and sorry for your loss. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this.\n\nI recently got an inheritance from my mom's estate that took the better part of 3 years for me to receive. It was about half the value of yours, but all in equities. I sold just enough to get myself completely out of debt (credit cards + car loan), and give myself a real emergency fund, so I won\u2019t have to deal with the debt trap again.

Expensive cars are just not a great thing to spend money on to optimize happiness.  You should probably be aiming to spend more like $15k on a car.\n\nThe good news is there isn't any rush to invest at the moment.  With interest rates so high you can park the cash in a HYSA or money market account and make over 4% interest.  Then what you should do is make it a part time job to read and figure out what you are going to invest in.  Take 6 months to a year and read the sidebar here (there is even a windfall section), read reputable personal finance books, and/or watch youtube videos.  After that start investing, and you can either use the money to retire early, or spend an extra $10k/year on yourself, or buy a house, or a combination.",

Theoretically, if you put all your money into VOO, you would have made about $20k in the past 5 months, or $4k a month. That\u2019s double your current salary, just from sitting on an index fund (which is relatively safe long term). The Vanguard VOO etf I got also pays dividends so I think you would\u2019ve also made a few hundred bucks in dividends this 1st half.\n\nThis is the long game tho, how does your life seriously change from having $200k on a stock to $240k on a stock? What I would honestly suggest is put this money on VOO (or other index) for now, but figure out what you want to do with your life and use this money or the profit from investing this money, to fuel that dream. Waiting for investment returns will be a lifetime, my life changed when I shifted from a savings mindset to an earning mindset and just focused on increasing my salary/revenue rather than being frugal.\n\nSaying all of this to say, sure buy the car, if it will increase your happiness/quality of life (this is what money is for), but have a plan.",

Do not \"invest\" it.\n\nThe other $100k sit comfortably on and take care of any immediate needs that you need to.\n\n*Personally, I would put $50k in a CD, $100k in a 3 year fixed annuity, and the other $50k for spending keep in a Money Market savings. APY right now is around 4-5%. Money market savings are liquid and NOT locked up. God forbid you need $50k - boom it's there for you.*",

CD's only offer short term options, and even money market accounts (not mutual fund money markets) at most institutions are only guaranteeing rates until end of the year.\n\nA 3 year, fixed, annuity is the perfect solution to maintain a decent level of on-the-side residual income off interest earned and getting locked in (around 5.25-6.3%) is a great idea. \n\nHalf of it into a longer term annuity (I wouldn't recommend 5yr terms right now)..... 1/4 of it into a CD to continue watching how rates move short term..... the other 1/4 keep fully liquid in a money market savings.\n\nThis will result in tens of thousands of earned interest at a fixed, safe, insured way. On top of enough liquidity for the short term immediate future (if needed), and a close eye on the changing market rates in a CD.\n\nIt's literally a win-win-win. Fast forward 3 years from now OP will have enough earned interest to throw a down payment onto a new home (perfect time for housing market to correct itself and prices to fall by then), he will still have all his original funds, and everything is fully liquid at that point where he can reanalyze the next steps depending on where his financial situation is at that time.\n\n$210k of inheritance needs to be very skillfully planned. Which this is.\n\n- $100k into a 3yr fixed, annuity at ~5.00%\n- $50k into shorter 5 month CD's around 5.25%\n- $50k into a liquid Money Market Savings around 4%\n\nWin win win.\n\nOverall he will grow that $200k into roughly $228,290 over the next 3 years.

I have $50k saved in my 401k and have some checking money. I have thought this out heavily. I think it\u2019s best to see a financial planner and get your money situated. I\u2019m thinking about a financial advisor but I\u2019m hesitant because of the fees ect. I think it\u2019s best to put a lot in index funds for the s&amp;p 500 that\u2019s are dividend (dividend funds). I think you want to keep it to 1-2 or maybe 3 funds because each fund has its fees as well. The problem right now is with the uncertainty of the stock market. With the commercial office loan leases ending soon and a lot of office tenants not renewing leases and going remote this in my opinion is going to cause some issues. We also have a full blown war going on in Europe and many would say the stock market is over valued. I think the financial planner is best for me but for you with that much money you should go straight to a vanguard or fidelity or even Trowe price and get a financial advisor to handle your money. That\u2019s a lot of money and your young and it will help you with guiding your financial future. For the car lol, I was in the same position and will give you the best advice. Go to CARMAX and buy a used car for like 12k-15k. I did it and let me tell you it\u2019s been 5 years and it\u2019s been amazing. They do a full blown massive checklist on the used cars they sell. They give you a used car that\u2019s really been updated. Great place to buy. Don\u2019t see a random financial advisor got to vanguard or fidelity / t rowe price. Really focus on funds that have dividend and have them reinvested.",

They didn\u2019t have to ask me for pay stubs because they called all of my former employers and were freely given all kinds of information about me. Information like:\n\n1. Salary history and job titles\n2. Detailed descriptions of my duties and performance reviews \n3. Whether or not I left on my own or was dismissed\n4. Whether or not I was eligible for rehire\n5. How much PTO time I had and had used\n\nI mean these agencies literally just call and badger the former HR departments until they give up all of your most sensitive info. I couldn\u2019t believe how detailed the reports were and how much information was given up about me. \n\nThere are always these threads on here where people say shit like, \u201cThey can\u2019t ask you that.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019ve been asked in interviews at every job if I\u2019m married, have children, own a home, have any medical conditions that would prevent me from being able to travel, etc. \n\nYou are really sheltered if you think they can\u2019t ask you invasive questions or get your salary information. They can. They can scour your social media, find out if you\u2019re gay, see pictures of you from when you had your gall bladder removed - and they don\u2019t even really need to ask. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy. \n\nEdit: I just went back and looked at the most recent report that an employer ran on me. It was 46 pages and included all the usual criminal and sex offender checks. \n\nBut 3 of my last 4 employers gave up all the information requested. \n\nThe notes read like, \u201cCST 11:13 a.m. Reached Operator and was transferred to Mark T., Director or HR. Reached voicemail. Left detailed voicemail requesting X information.  CST 02:37 p.m. Reached Operator and was transferred to Mark T., Director of HR. Verified employment start date of A. Verified salary of B. Verified number of direct reports of C. Verified PTO/leave hours of D available and E used. Verified promotion to (new title) on (date). Verified new salary of F. Verified number of direct reports of G. etc. \n\nYou get the picture. And here\u2019s the thing - *I know Mark T.* Like I know who he is. I know they aren\u2019t bullshitting the report because their answers were more accurate than mine. I thought I got promoted October 3 and they knew it was September 28 or whatever. \n\nSo yes - your former employers absolutely can and will give all of your information away to a total stranger on the phone and there is nothing you can do about it.

But they were mad I left and put in my file as a no rehire. \n\nOnly reason I even knew about it was because I was asked a question about my previous employment and why I left. When I told them there was no room for advancement, refusal to give me pay increases that were overdue, and responsibilities that went well beyond my position, they asked why I wouldn't be rehire-able then\n\nVerifying employment is perfectly fine. Anything beyond that IMO is overstepping a boundary. \n",

It *is* illegal for them to do anything that actually has a detrimental effect on your ability to get hired.  They can also be on the hook for portraying an employee as competent when he or she is not.\n\nFor example - giving out salary information is not illegal.  Giving out salary information that the prospective employer chooses to use as a reason not to hire you may be illegal.  There would certainly be a case for it at least.  The same is true regarding performance reviews and termination specifics.  Most companies don't want to inadvertently accept that liability.",

Sometimes people don\u2019t know their worth wether it is high or low. Examples would be I was recruiting for chemical engineers with zero experience fresh out of college. Out of like 20 kids none of them went over 40k. The going rate for a chemical engineer starts at 50k with no experience, so I sent them all over at 50-55k with a note that said willing to negotiate in that range. The flip side of that was a project manager in IT wanted 65 an hr or 135k a year with only 3 years of experience out of college and only 1.5 years of that in actual project management experience. People can be delusional.\n\nMy job is to get you the job, I\u2019m going to get you the most money because I get more money that way. Most of the times it\u2019s the actual hiring manager at the company or their HR that makes the call on pay. Unless a company requires us to send a pay rate, we don\u2019t even send one when we send a candidate over for submital. \n\nTruthfully most companies are not looking for the best qualified candidate for the job, they are looking at the best person they can afford for their budget. I was always taught to recruit on the money first and not the job description because a job description is like a wish list for the company. I usually look for people based off of what they are asking for and also how close the job is to where they live. Location generally can override pay for good candidates. ",

However, they will raise the salary for someone new who comes on because there isn't an employee with your same experience to replace you for that low of a salary",

Most people are too lazy or scared to leave.   If you are a big employer and have 1000 employees, you could either give them all fair pay rises, or give them 2% a year.   \n  \nSure, some of the 1000 will up and leave and get more money elsewhere.  But so many stay, that the company saves a lot of money.  \n  \nIf you choose to stay, you are sacrificing income to be comfortable at your employer.    \n  \nThis HR policy is not a secret, your manager would likely openly share it if asked.   \n",

The one time I did get a title change I got a decent hourly pay bump, but every other year it was a 3% cost of living increase. But I counted on my loyalty to that company when I was looking to move jobs and up on the ladder. I went from an Associate to a Director and a large part of that was time spent in a particular field. My current company liked that I wanted to expand my knowledge of the position and didn't need to learn the industry (Theater). With the jump came a significant pay bump even after negotiation. I'm HR so I've actually seen the resumes that came in for my position and I've discussed their hiring process in general. They are much more critical of people who have a lot of different experience than those who have a few jobs for larger chunks of time. ",

Plus if ceo\\exec positions were more public, employees might start demanding more reasonable pay",

    "postText": "Like let's say I've hypothetically contributed $500/month to my 401(k) for the first 6 months of the year. In the last 6 months I want to hit that max of 22.5. So I've contributed 3k so far and have 19.5k to go. Can I just contribute $3250/month for the remaining 6 months of the year to hit the max? And then scale that back to $1875/month when January comes? Is that a thing that one can do with a 401(k)?\n\nSorry if this comes across as a naive question, but I'd really like to know the flexibility that's allowed here.",

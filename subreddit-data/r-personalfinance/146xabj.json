    "postText": "I financed a new car yesterday and the gap insurance was going to be $1200 total. I elected not to take it.\n\nDoes anyone know of a good place to buy it on a monthly basis that can be cancelled in the future? I just didn't want to bundle it into my loan nor pay in a lump sum.\n\nSo far I tried Geico, but they don't offer it. My state is Florida.\n\n\n**Update:**\n\nThanks for the replies so far. As mine is apparently a commonly stolen model of car, I see great value in paying $50-100 or so per year for gap coverage for the time being.\n\nI'm a Geico customer with a good rate on regular auto insurance and they don't offer gap coverage (at least not in my zip), so I am specifically seeking a company that I can buy it from as a standalone product. So far I've tried Progressive, Allstate, and Nationwide and none of the call centers could do so.\n\nAllstate said a local agent may be able to, so I plan to call one tomorrow.\n\nAny other suggestions meanwhile for a company that can do it standalone?\n\nMy google searches are finding articles on sites like NerdWallet that use the terms like \"standalone gap insurance\", but are really referring to policies that also require you to have auto insurance with the provider that's offering the gap coverage. I can shop around again, but every time I've looked, Geico has been much cheaper for me than competitors.",

They will keep taking your money. In my experience one of the reasons the dealer policy is such crud is that you really only need it for a portion of the loan term. If you take short loans w/ big payments you may need it less than one year.",

I do agree with the comment about getting it through a credit union as a cheaper option. In my experience, the credit union lenders weve used for our auto loans- offer gap at around $300-$500, way less than $900-$1200 from dealership. Its something you might be able to discuss if you seek a pre approval through your lender before purchasing. If not, you can add it after- you just run the risk of not having coverage from the time you drive off the lot to when you receive coverage. It's a slightly minimal risk- but still a risk.",

The next day you get t-boned and the car is totaled, your insurance will pay out 24k but you still owe 30k. Your responsible for that 6k difference. Gap insurance will pay out that \u201cgap\u201d between the loan value and the cars actual value.",

I sold cars for a short period, and 90% of people were buying cars they couldn\u2019t truly afford with. And the amount of people moving some of their old cars loan to their new cars loan was crazy, just adding to the problem. Imagine buying a 30k car for 40k because you owed 10k more than it was worth when you sold the old car.",

Maybe get a new insurance policy that won't require you to have gap insurance. I've had 1 BMW 5 series and an Acura Type S get totalled and the insurance paid off both. I still owed $21k on the BMW. No gap insurance.",

Yes they will pay you the value of the car but if you owe 25k and the car is worth 21k you will still need to pay the remainder 4k. \n\nRight now the used car market is still pretty crazy so cars are not going underwater near as bad but typically new cars are worth much more than a car that was owned for 3 months.",

You\u2019re also not likely going to get back any tax title doc fees paid already as part of the purchase. GAP insurance could help with that. It depends on the carrier and the agreed value in case of total loss.",

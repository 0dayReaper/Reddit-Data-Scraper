    "postText": "Hi I start my first job out of college in August and am looking to get a credit card or credits cards. My job requires that I travel M-Th on a weekly basis. I live in Chicago so I\u2019m planning on booking through United exclusively. I was wondering what credit cards would be best so I can get a little kick back from all the travel I\u2019ll be doing for work? According the credit karma my credit score is 750 so I assume that makes me eligible for most cards. Thanks for the help in advance.",

Or you can get an Amex or chase sapphire and use their travel rewards instead.\n\nETA: do you get to book your own travel or does the company?  That would actually change my recommendation.",

Then I would def get the United card (just don\u2019t get anything with a crazy annual fee) and then whatever hotel chain card you prefer (Or go the Amex/chase sapphire route if you prefer).\n\n\nETA: yeah I forget things. Lol.  Or you could get a really good cash back card and make money off the travel.",

Something like the Sapphire Reserve gives 3x points on travel and you can transfer the points to United. \n\nThere\u2019s a United Reserve card that will give you lounge access, high annual fee but the lounges are decent. If you have to rebook it can be a lot easier to get help at the lounge than through the gate agent.\n\nWhatever you get make sure you actually justify how you\u2019ll use the benefits and don\u2019t just read the blogs who will make it sound like every benefit is the easiest thing in the world to use and each point is worth 50 cents.",

Decent benefits and you\u2019ll rack up points pretty quickly. \n\nIf you book through concur you\u2019ll probably get some United for business benefit which will give you a better boarding group and better free seat options.",

If the company will purchase the plane tickets rather than you buying it and being reimbursed, I would recommend getting a some sort of cash back card (personally I really like my cash + Visa card from US bank)",

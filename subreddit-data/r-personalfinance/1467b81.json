    "postText": "Someone in this sub made a comment that spending HSA now is better than spending it later but did not explain why. Unless you have unlimited resources to cover your healthcare costs in retirement, why would it be better to spend it now? My income is expected to be lower in retirement so my plan is not to touch my HSA but let it grow.",

            "comment": "I personally believe that a HSA is one of the best investment vehicles out there.  For those who don't know, an HSA allows you to:\n\n* Take a tax deduction on any contribution you put in\n* Investments grow tax deferred\n* Distributions, when paying healthcare expenses, are tax free.\n\nOne of those rare triple tax free programs out there.\n\nThat being said, I would absolutely use a HSA now, if I didn't have any other means of paying my healthcare expenses.  Like I wouldn't start raking up credit card debt or dipping into my cash reserves, to avoid making a HSA distribution.",

Got it up to 192,000 miles from 32,000 when I bought it, before it got totaled last month.  I feel like I could have easily gotten 250,000-300,000 too.",

Now super low miles miles at 84k miles, but it's about (192k - 84k miles = 108k miles less) 108k miles less than what my previous car has on it before being totaled.  If driving 15k miles per year, ideally that car should last at least 7.2 more years to reach the total miles my previous Chevy Impala had.",

            "comment": "To add to this discussion, I think your time expectation (4 - 6 years) might be a little low for that price point. \n\nMy personal experience: \n\nI've owned 3 cars over the past 18 years. Bought for about $3k, $5k, and $7k respectively from a private seller, a family member, and a dealership respectively, all in cash.  \n\nPut back another $1.5 to $3k in repairs on the first, $0 on the second, and less than $500 (so far) on the last. \n\nTotals with repairs (max) $6k, $5k, and $7.5k. Which comes to a grand total $18.5k, over 18 years. \n\nThere are other factors to consider, such as time, hassles, and other soft costs (insurance rates, taxes, etc.), but my experience has led me to believe that vehicles should average out to around $2k - $2.5k a year in costs (excluding fluids/typical consumables) all in. So if I bought a $15k used vehicle, I'm thinking it needs to last 7+ years.\n\nImo, your best purchase is one that can get you closest to that breakdown. You'll need to look at the specific cars and do some research on your specific case. Especially when factoring loan lifetime/interest accrued and gambling on repair work.",

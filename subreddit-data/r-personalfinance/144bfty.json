I worked in tech in the US for a couple of years and lived in a LCOL area, so I have a fair bit of savings across multiple accounts. Together, it's more than USD 100k, not including 401k. What's the best plan of action to transfer these assets to the UK?  We do not intend to move back to the US, so keeping the money in accounts here is not a viable option for us.\n\nEDIT: None of us are US citizens, in case that matters",

As a US citizen its really hard to get foreign bank accounts due to US banking reporting regulations that apply to all US citizens at home or abroad.\n\nAssuming you have the right to open a bank account in the UK, moving your money should be as simple as a wire transfer. Some US banks like Fidelity offer free outgoing international wires, so just make sure your UK bank doesn't charge to receive incoming wires and you should be good to go.\n\nAlso, make sure the bank you use to receive the money doesn't charge a fee on top of the currency exchange rate they provide.",

            "comment": "&gt; What's the best plan of action to transfer these assets to the UK?\n\nTwo decent options; one is \"simpler\" but may cost more; the other needs a little more work on your own.\n\n1) Multinational banks : Citi for instance : offer \"global transfers\" with no wire charges, if you are transferring money to accounts with their own bank. You'd need one account here in the US: another there in the UK with the same back.\n\nWith this : you'd move all your money into the US account; then transfer to the UK account.\n\nNote that while you save on the \"wire\" charges : the forex conversion rates from these banks are significantly higher than for other approaches. Plus, these banks have monthly fees and other charges on these accounts that add to the cost.\n\nPro : simple processes each side. \n\nCon : Cost of conversion and any banking fees.\n\n\n2) It still makes sense to consolidate your money into a single account; then use a service like Wise to transfer across geo's and currencies.\n\nPro : you can use any bank at each end; your costs for conversion and transfer work out lower.\n\nCon : you have additional steps to make the transfer.\n\n\nKeep in mind : ACH transfers within the US (or depositing a check) doesn't cost money; but may take additional days. Plan ahead, and consolidate money into one account so that WHEN you transfer, you do a one-time transaction.\n\nSecond : You mentioned partner + you. If you've consolidated finances, one account suffices. If you haven't consolidated and want to keep your money separate - each of you needs to do the same (consolidate - transfer).",

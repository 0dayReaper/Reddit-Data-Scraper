    "postText": "I live in Orlando, and cost of living here has gone up a lot in the last few years. We moved here at almost the height of the housing market so we haven\u2019t purchased yet. I make about 140yr. I have been offered a job making about 100 in the Indianapolis area. \n\nWhile it\u2019s a significant pay cut, the cost of living is much less. Houses are cheaper, property tax is cheaper, and insurance is cheaper. I\u2019d also have a better schedule and probably quality of life. \n\nLast consideration is retirement. If I stay here, by the time I retire I\u2019ll probably be making around 170-190 give or take, and my pension will be roughly 45% of that. With the new job, I\u2019ll be at the top of the pay scale and will only make federal raises for the remainder, so my pension would be significantly less. I\u2019m guessing my salary would be around 135ish at retirement. \n\nI know I have to decide myself on the happiness scale of things, but is it a terrible financial decision?",

I earn about the same as you, but I was fortunate in that I owned some investment real estate in Orlando that I bought when the market crashed.  So no house payments.  But, if I were in your situation, I wouldn't move.  BUT, if you are more of a home body, you can get a LOT nicer house in Indy for the same money.  \n\nI like Orlando a lot better than Indianapolis, mostly because there isn't much to do in Indy.  The summers are hot like Orlando, and the winters can be brutally cold.  I do miss the huge house I owned in Indy, but my children are all moved out on their own, so I didn't need something so big.",

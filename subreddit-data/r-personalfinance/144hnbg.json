    "postText": "If I have private insurance (which is always supposed to be primary) and medicaid (which is also secondary), do I have to alert my insurers?\n\nIf I don't, what will happen?\n\nI'm asking because the process of prescribing and billing would be a lot simpler at times if I just ran one plan for certain services/prescriptions. \n\nFor example: what if my primary plan's PBM/mail-order is out of stock of a certain medication, but my medicaid's PBM/mail-order does have the medication in stock? Is my doctor required to prescribe through my primary?",

Or you are violating participation rules.  Once it's found out, if it's past filing requirement time periods you will be liable for costs when the provider has money pulled back.",

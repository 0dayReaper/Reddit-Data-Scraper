    "postText": "Husband and I will be selling a home we own outright and expect to make 350k+ \n\nI want to use it as wisely as possible afterwards to set ourselves up responsibly. \n\nWe have to build ourselves a new home in a much LCOL state but do not expect that to cost over 300k so that leaves us with roughly 50k to make decisions about. We have other savings for a year of living expenses. \n\nI have been combing through various Reddit pages, reading the wikis and other peoples posts. \n\nThis is what my plan is so far: \n\nOpen a HYSA and put the house money in there, withdrawing strategically so I don\u2019t incur penalties. Seems like 6x a month is somewhat standard with no fees? That way the large amount can generate 4% interest instead of just sitting in an account. \n\nOpen a Roth IRA for the first time\u2026put in the max yearly contribution of $6200 for this year and then invest it..so that way there is *something* put away that can grow over the years? I am embarrassed to say we have not done anything like this and have nothing invested or saved for retirement but we are only 29 and 33. This leaves us at $43,800\n\nWhat else am I missing? Do you need to do a Roth IRA and a 401k? This is all so confusing to me. We are self employed and our business is closing down since we are moving states. \n\nAlso how do you know which company to go with for the Roth IRA and HYSA? Do I want one that can also having a checking account? \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I would certainly do the Roth. The investment option is ridiculously simple; a broad market index fund with something like .2% yearly fees. \n\nSo I don't reinvest the wheel here just google \"why are index funds better?\"\n\nBonus financial planning nugget: 10 years from when you need the money (retirement time!) you should look for your exit ramp and move the funds from the stock market and into something safe. If at the time the market is up, pull. If the market is in the middle of a recession, you have time to wait for a recovery so you can then move them.",

You can do that by opening a brokerage account through a company like Vanguard or Fidelity. \n\nOnly keep as much as you expect to spend in the next 5-7 years (including as much as you need for an emergency fund) in the HYSA. Index funds have a much better ROI for long term savings.",

That\u2019s the beauty of index funds; they are maximally diversified so much safer than buying individual stocks. In a *major* recession you can temporarily lose ~50%, but if you keep calm and don\u2019t sell, you will eventually recoup the losses and then some.

    "postText": "Interested in transferring funds from past 401k (fidelity, FXAIX) and brokerage account (TDA, VTSAX) to Merill Edge to up my preferred rewards tier. How would this work and what should i be aware of? \n\nFrom my understanding if Merrill edge has the same funds as what I currently have it would transfer over in kind so basically the same just on a different platform with no realization or tax consequences. But if Merrill edge doesn't have the same funds what happens? In the case of the 401k I think it should be fine either way since even if they exit my position and I rebuy something similar since it would be rollover into an IRA there shouldn't be any tax consequenes, but for the brokerage if they don't have it would i incur capital gains at that point?",

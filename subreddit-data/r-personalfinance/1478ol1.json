    "postText": "I received a credit card offer that would allow me a direct deposit cash advance with 0% APR for one year, and 3% transaction fee. If I took the cash advance and put it in a CD or HYSA with 4% interest, at the end of one year, I would be gaining one percent on the amount that I cash advanced. Is there a catch here?\n\nEdit: looks like I won\u2019t be taking that offer. Thanks all!",

And my guess is that you'll probably have to make payments every month toward the balance on the credit card so you won't be able to keep all the money in the CD/HYSA for the whole year.\n\nAlso, carrying that extra balance will probably bring your credit rating down a bit.  And if for any reason you don't pay the balance off before the 0% expires, that would be bad.",

These are credit card companies praying on people because every one is an opportunity to snatch some poor sap at 20%+ interest rate for the loooooong haul. \n\nHonestly be disgusted by these offers.",

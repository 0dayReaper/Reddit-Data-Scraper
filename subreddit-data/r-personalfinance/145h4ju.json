They'll let you pay cash for a car as long as you can prove the savings wasn't based on some illegal activity. \n\nI bought the cheapest used car on the lot with cash and a credit card. Then when I had income, I bought a new car with a loan letter from my credit union, traded-in that car as the down payment, and paid off the credit union after the first payment with less scrutiny than if I'd paid cash for the car when I bought it.",

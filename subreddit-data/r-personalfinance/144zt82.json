    "postText": "I am Italian and I currently live in Italy, but I have lived and worked in Massachusetts and now I have around 10K USD in my BofA account.\n\nI don't need this money right now. So, I though I would leave it as it is and keep the account open, also because I don't rule out moving back to the US in the future.\n\nHowever, BofA monthly fees and inflation are (although slowly) eating through these 10K and I am looking for options to balance it out.\n\nI've read the wiki and I would gladly buy treasury bonds, except I can't because I'm not an US resident nor a citizen. BofA savings interest are (as far as I know) around 0.01%, basically useless right?\n\nIs there anything else I can do? Or do I just suck it up?",

They have already verified you, as required by law, so call them and tell them you are being eaten by fees and you need an account that doesn't have that. With the balance you have, they should have it available.\nYou can ask if they can add a Merrylynch account for you as well, so you can use it to trade, if you want to.\nUS banks will not open an account with a POBox. It is against the law and they don't fuck around with that.",

If you go that route, you have to do some shopping around. What will be important is fees, because you will not be depositing money frequently, you will want a savings account (HYSA is best). Just stay away from BoA, Wells Fargo, TD Bank, &amp; Truist. Chase is pretty safe on the fees, but if you care about the environment, stay far away.\n\nSecond is going for bank like or online banks. These ones focus on low foreign currency fees &amp; don't require a SSN. Some well known ones are Revolut, Majority, Payoneer, &amp; Wise. I don't know much about them reputation wise, so do some more research.\n\n\nIf you want to trade bonds or CDs, you might look into a CMA like fidelity, I just don't know if they require a social.",

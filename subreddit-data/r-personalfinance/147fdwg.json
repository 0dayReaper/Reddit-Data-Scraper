    "postText": "I recently had a crash where i was at fault. I have third party property insurance. I haven't dealt with any claims etc before so it is a bit of info to learn.  \nThe car I hit didn't have a lot of damage. It was a rear end collision; the plastic-y area under their trunk had some damage.  \nI haven't contacted my insurance yet to make a claim. Some people have told me that I should wait for their repair costs to be sent to me, and see if it is higher / lower than my excess, and if it's lower, than settle out of insurance.  \nI'm worried that if I don't contact my insurance, and the repair costs are very high for some reason, then I would not be able to make a claim.  \nDoes making a claim lock in the fact that the insurance will take care of it? Or can I still decide to pay out of pocket after their insurance company bills me?  \np.s. based in nsw - AU",

And you want to let your insurance company know immediately if something like this happens, because if you wait a week and a half it going to raise a red flag, especially if you don't have a police report, because then they have no way of knowing when it actually happened, and whether it happened the way you say it did, or where you said it did, and if neither you or the other driver has any documentation they might start thinking fraud, and that you rear-ended him on purpose and he was in on it.",

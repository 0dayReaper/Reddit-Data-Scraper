Sorry if this is a repost, but this was a literal lifesaver for me.\n\nEDIT: In my case income level was never asked.  Also, the company benefits by hoping people with max out their maximum-out-of-pocket.  This discount only applies to what the insurance company won't pay.  \n\nShout out to hot Wendi for telling me!",

If I had have gone through my \"really amazing work healthcare plan\" (so I'm told), it would have been $100/mo and I'm still not certain it would have counted towards the \"correct\" OOP max number, because they really wouldn't confirm it over the phone.

This is solid advice, we get paid to figure this stuff out and are pretty familiar with specific drug resources. \n\nI usually start by conferring with the prescribing MD, can we use a different drug class or a generic? Next I'll explore discount cards, we have a state specific one but goodRX and Needy Meds are also good. After that I'll call different pharmacies, walmart has a $4 list and sometimes costco is cheaper than Walgreens. After that I will call drug specific companies for financial assistance. Sometimes, they often have specific applications requiring proof of income. If all of this fails (like some of my folks who need supplements that are OTC) I have several community financial resource applications we can fill out or we can get creative with other resources ( like the food stamp reimbursement program where you can submit medical claims and get more food stamp money in return!) \n\nIt's a ton of work and we are always updating and learning new resources so definitely lean on us :)",

                    "comment": "I\u2019m a pharmacist in NYC and these manufacturers coupons cannot be used if you have any federal state or city sponsored plan.  So anyone on Medicare Part D or Medicaid or ACA plans are out of luck.  It\u2019s due to the manufacturers giving rebates back to the government for each RX drug sold.  So the manufacturers don\u2019t want to give out discounts and rebates on the same prescription.  \n  This actually screws a lot of the elderly people.  The manufacturers coupons are good if you have prescription insurance from your employer though and they can save you a ton of money.  \nThe Good rx discount card is a bit of a misnomer.  It works by charging you a rate that is typically what an insurance company might pay for a drug for someone who has an insurance plan.  \nFor instance.  An asthma inhaler might cost the pharmacy $300 bucks.  If someone comes in with no insurance and pays cash we charge them maybe 330-340 bucks as a fair price.  Some pharmacies might charge 400 bucks based on expenses of the store...rent due to location, staff salaries electric etc.  \nthe discount card will charge them the rate that the insurance company might pay which is like $320 which saves the person $10 bucks.  \n\nBut Good rx also charges me $10 bucks to give this discount to the customer ( that\u2019s how they make their money on a free card they gave you) it comes out of the profit of the pharmacy.  A typical pharmacy has gross margins of 20-25 percent and net margins of less than 3 percent.  Retail pharmacy is slowly dying due to the mail order plans, the third party reimbursement rAte from express scripts Caremark Aetna optum etc..they even pay LESS than the cost of some drugs esp insulin.  \n\nI\u2019ve fill at least 10% of the prescriptions every day at a loss.  We try to make it up in the front end or negotiation with our wholesalers over our generic drug costs.  But it\u2019s like a slow death by 1000 cuts so to speak.  \n\nSorry for the rant but most people don\u2019t realize the business end of a local retail pharmacy.  That\u2019s why CVs and Walgreens sell all the other stuff since you make more money when someone buys a six pack of beer and ice cream than they do if you help them with their medication.  It\u2019s very discouraging since most pharmacists do want to help people use their meds properly. I\u2019ve been in the same store for 30 years and know my patients by name.  I\u2019ve helped them when their children were young and now they are grown with kids of their own.  I watched them age and get sick and have been to many wakes and have been upset when my friends(patients) pass on.  \n\nThis country has to do something to fix our broken medical system.  It\u2019s ridiculous that we are behind so many other developed countries in the world on health care.  \n",

Like if you use insurance on a card, you can't then also apply GoodRx on it. You pick one or the other because a card like GoodRx is giving you an upfront cost to pay and doesn't get processed through insurance.\n\n* Discount cards for specific drugs from manufacturers allow you to lower the copay under a commercial or private insurance plan, but you can't use it with insurance from a federal plan like Medicare, Medicaid, or Tricare. You also can't use both a prescription discount card and also a manufacturer card on a specific drug. ",

Deep discounts now build brand loyalty and name recognition, making those patients less likely to switch to a generic, and \n\n3) most of those programs are connected to collection of personal information, including the diagnosis that means you need that drug.  That all goes into a marketing list and often a disease state/historical research follow-up database.  So you'll get corporate marketing materials/offers for new drugs and also occasionally a \"hey, you were on X for X years, care to fill out a survey about how well it worked/side effects, etc.?\"  Those databases are hugely valuable to companies, way more than the individual drug discounts, esp for chronic illnesses where patients will generally constitute essentially captive audiences. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsource: lawyer who occasionally does \"privacy\" work for big pharma.

Generics cost a fraction of the amount and the insurance company tries to push you in that direction by making the copay cheaper, so drug companies make those copay cards to reduce the end-user cost of their drugs, but insurance still pays a huge amount. In the end this just makes insurance more expensive for everyone and serves to further harm our medical system in the US. \n\nRegulation could help but doubtful that would happen in the current political climate.

    "postText": "Incoming resident phsycian. So my employer has two plans for health insurance. I am married and also including my spouse. \n\n1) Classic plan: Monthly contribution: Me: $237, Employer: $915\n\n2) HDHP HSA plan: Monthly contribution: Me: $133, Employer: $841  \n\n\nMy understanding is, for the classic plan, contribution from both me and my employer goes directly to Health insurance as premium. \n\nMy question is, for the HDHP HSA plan, the contribution from me and my employer, does all of it (133+841) get deposited into my HSA account? or only the $133 that I am contributing?\n\nThank you for your help.",

            "comment": "Sounds like the $133 is your monthly premium and not your HSA contribution. Same with the employer portion. You need to check with your employer to be sure, but I don't believe any of it is a contribution to an HSA.\n\nAlso, if you are covered under your wife's health plan(s), make sure those are HSA-eligible plans. If not, you are not eligible to contribute to an HSA even though your plan with the employer is an HSA-eligible plan.",

It's usually as an extra stimulus from the employer to get you to take the least expensive option.\n\nIronically enough, the HSA is also the best option for many people. Unfortunately, the masses are scared, and not knowledgeable. They'd rather overpay for classic plans as they understand those better.",

In fact, many employers (especially medical) with both options will contribute a substantial portion of the difference to the HSA. I would find out what that contribution is to know whether it\u2019s worth it or not.",
